I  received your
letter[1]

the day before yesterday, and yesterday I wrote to inform you that the
articles on the peasant
reform[4] had been sent to you. Let me know whether you have the article
on
     Postnikov.[2]

If you have it, send it as soon as you can to N.Â Y. with the request that
it be forwarded to me immediately after it has been read; I need it.  

I  am very sorry you did not find me in
      Samara.[3]

Are you planning a trip to the capitals for the holidays? If you are, we
could meet.  

I  am expecting from you a critical analysis in as minute detail as
possible of the article on Postnikov: I trust you have noticed that I am
drawing far more important and far-reaching conclusions from the premises
set forth in it than are to he found in the article itself. The
disintegration of our small producers (the peasants and handicrafts men)
appears to me to be the basic and principal fact explaining our urban and
large-scale capitalism, dispelling the myth that the peasant economy
represents some special structure (it is the same bourgeois structure with
the sole difference that it is still shackled to a far greater extent by
feudal fetters), and making it patent that what are called âworkersâ are
not a handful of specially circumstanced

  Â  

people but simply the outer layers of the vast mass of peas ants who
already derive their livelihood more from the sale of their labour power
than from their own husbandry. I value Postnikovâs book so highly just
because it contains data for a precise examination of the situation,
provides factual proof of the absurdity of the current notions concerning
our âcommunalâ village, and shows that, essentially, the pattern in our
country does not differ from that of Western Europe.  

I  offered the article to Russkaya
Mysl[5] but it did not choose to publish it. I have been wondering
whether it would be better to enlarge and revise the article somewhat and
publish it in pamphlet form.  

It  would be very interesting to hear your opinion on this; I think this
could be done by correspondence.  

The  basic premise in my comments on the works about the reform was that
this reform stemmed from the development of commodity economy and that its
entire meaning and purpose was the destruction of the fetters retarding and
restricting the development of this system. We shall discuss this in
greater detail some other timeâperhaps I shall be able to forward to you
the comments I sent to the author; this would be simplest and most
convenient.  

Let  me have your reply as soon as possible, indeed at once, otherwise
the letter may not find me here.

30.V.94 

Received your letter the day before yesterday. I indeed had almost
forgotten about our correspondence and about the review, but I am of course
very pleased to resume correspondence on the questions raised by it, as
well as on other questions.  

One thing surprises meâwhy did you have to âsearchâ for me?  Didnât
       N.Â M.Â A.[1]

see you on his return to Tiflis from St.Â Petersburg and inform you (as I
asked him to) that I have a permanent addressâfor the winter at
leastânamely: Bar Council, Advocate N.Â N.  

Concerning your
      comments,[2]

I should like to say this. First, as regards the conclusions being too
cautious, it should be borne in mind that this shortcoming


[[LEFT-OPEN-BRACKET: I fully agree that this is really a shortcoming ]]

is due to my intention to have the article published in a liberal
journal. I actually was naÃ¯ve enough to send it to Russkaya
Mysl, which of course turned it down: I fully understood why when I
read in Russkaya Mysl No.Â 2 an article about Postnikov by âour
well-knownâ liberal vulgariser, Mr. V.Â V. It takes some artistry to
mutilate splendid material so thoroughly and to bury the facts in sheer
verbiage!  

The fact is that I draw from these data some major conclusions. Namely,
that the data, in my opinion, point to the bourgeois nature of the economic
relationships existing among the peasantry. They strikingly reveal the
existence

  Â  

of antagonistic classes in this âcommunalâ peasantry; moreover,
of classes that are characteristic only of capitalist organisation of the
social economy. This is the cardinal conclusion, and one fully applicable
to the rest of the Russian peasantry.  Another conclusion is that already
now a huge proportion (probably no less than half and most likely more) of
peasant-grown grain goes to the market, and that the principal producer of
this grain is the top group of the present-day villageâthe peasant
     bourgeoisie.[3]


Further, I attach much importance to the fact established by Postnikov
that as a rule throughout Russia the productivity of labour is 2â2Â 1/2
times higher in the upper groups of the peasantry. This is of enormous
importance from the theoretical standpoint, as is the ascertaining of the
commercial farm area (a point so dangerous for the Russian
exceptionalists that I fully appreciate Mr. V.Â V.âs careful avoidance of
the question).  

As for your second remarkâconcerning the norm of natural economyâI
must admit that I do not quite understand you.  

The question of a ânormâ, to my mind, is meaningful only in this
sense: it is important to know how big an area the average peasant must
cultivate to meet all his needs (both production and personal) and manage
without outside earnings.  

This is important to know since all peasant farms below this level fall
into the category of those selling labour power, and the size of the farm
is a fairly accurate indicator to what extent it depends on this source of
income. Households in the higher groups are petty-bourgeois pure and
simple.  

As regards the share of ânaturalâ economy, I believe it is invariably
the greatest in the middle group of peasants, but there too commodity
economy is bound to account for a substantial (probably some 40 perÂ cent of
the

  Â  

total budget must be in monetary form). Farms of the lower and top groups
will always be more of a commodity type, for the first sells labour power
and the second, surpluses of grain.  

The analysis of the groups given in the article on Postnikov is along
these lines.  

You speak of the ânorm of natural economyâ and the ânorm of
commodity economyâ as of two separate things.  If I understood you right,
the latter is my average norm



[[SINGLE-BOX-ENDS:

17â18 dessiatines of crop area according to Postnikovâs figures ]]

in which, of course, it is important to separate and calculate exactly
the natural and money components. I do not see that there is any
self-contained ânorm of natural economyâ; our contemporary peasant
economy cannot be a pure natural economy whatever its dimensions.  

However, here it is better to wait for a more detailed explanation from
you.  


As regards the criticism of N.Â K. Mikhailovsky, I also believe that no
publication will print it, not so much because of considerations of
censorship (rumour has it that the censors are exorcising Russian Marxism
following the commotion raised by Russkoye
Bogatstvo[4]) as of disagreement with you and fear of an impudent
and conceited âbig wigâ. Iâve had some experience in this respect.



[[DOUBLE-BOX-ENDS: Nor do I think it possible or worth while to
reply to him in our press.  ]]

It would give me pleasure to read your reply.  


I shall probably be here until JuneÂ 12, and perhaps longer. I shall let
you know my new address when I leave. In the meantime you can write (after
the 12th) through M.H.H.; it will be quicker to forward mail from there.

reconciliation with the tsarist government and waged an implacable struggle
against Marxism and the Russian Marxists.

31.V.94 

Just received your second letter and am hurrying to reply; if you write
at once your answer may still find me here (Iâll probably be here until
JuneÂ 12).  

Your suggestion appeals to me very much in principle. On
particulars, however, I cannot pass judgement, not having seen your
article. As for my own
       article,[1]

strictly speaking, I do not think it is worth printing in its present form
(the form of a simple review of V.Â Y. Postnikovâs
       book).[2]


(In regard to the cost of publication, I think something not very long
would be much cheaper.)  

All in all it seems that the matter will have to be put off until
      autumn,[3]

for even if you managed to send the article here it would still take quite
some time before it could be published. We shall have to discuss this
thoroughly in detail by letter. Still better would it be to meet in
      person[4]

;

if you have the means (and the desire) to publish and want to write, and if
we see eye to eye, it should be possible to
   arrange....[5]

I received The
  Housing[1]

and got down to work. The point is that you left things unfinished. In
reading the

  Â  

final copy a heap of mistakes was discovered (the drawings too, I found,
caused much confusion). After reading it, our common acquaintances said the
work was very poor. Therefore I had to sit down to revise it, sick and
tired though I was of the job. The result was that the clean copy turned
out to be a rough draft.  

Can you send
meÂ ...[2]

by Engels with the 1894 afterword. You can forward it the usual
way. The address will be the same roughly until AugustÂ 15, after which
the winter address should be used.  

You did not fully distinguish between the Germans and the
       German[3]

in your letter. The lack of âtheoretical interestâ on the part of the
former is understandable to me (though regrettable), but can the same be
said about the latter? When giving an interpretation of a question one
should not avoid analysing it. True, I recently came across an instance of
inability to see what was at issue and why it was important, but I should
not like to believe that the same sort of thing can be expected there.

In this letter Lenin evidently refers to his What the

Social-Democrats, which was proposed to be published abroad (see
present edition, Vol.Â 1, pp.Â 129â332). The two works mentioned are
Frederick Engelsâs The Housing Question and âAfterword to On
Social Relations in Russiaâ (see Marx and Engels, Selected

In the summer of 1894 Lenin stayed with relatives in the country in
Kuzminki, near Moscow, and in August returned to St.Â Petersburg.

To Nakhamkis
   

To answer your questions:
1) In referring to âusâ and âthe editorsâ I had in mind the article on
the programme of Rabocheye
Dyelo[2] and nothing
else.[1]

2) The collocutors in Bellerive were we two: Potresov and myself,
your new acquaintances.
3) If I previously told you that you were not right and then wrote and
stressed that you were right, this means that my views had changed and
approximated to yours.  

We hope to be able in the not very distant future to inform you and
Goldendakh (we place great hopes on the closest co-operation with you both)
of the final form of the relationships (on the editorial plane) between us
(the two collocutors in Bellerive+one in RussiÂ )
and the Emancipation of Labour
group.[3] 

Thanks for the article âThe Historical Preparation of Russian
Social-Democracyâ: we are very happy to print it and believe that our
journal[4] would gain much if such articles appeared in it more
frequently. The article will also be sent to the Emancipation of Labour
group, so please do not be annoyed by a possible delay.  

My colleague has one point to make: the credit for establishing the
first contacts with the workers belongs not to the groups you mention, but
to the Chaikovsky
group.[5]

Rabocheye Dyelo (The Workersâ Cause)âa journal published by
the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad in Geneva from April 1899 to
February 1902. It was edited by B.Â N. Krichevsky, P.Â F. Teplov (Sibiryak),
V.Â P. Ivanshin and later also A.Â S. Martynov. A total of 12Â issues (nine
books) was put out. The Editorial Board of the journal was the Economistsâ
centre abroad.  

Lenin gave a critique of the Rabocheye Dyelo viewpoint in his
What Is To Be Done? (see present edition, Vol.Â 5, pp.Â 347â529).



__PRINTERS_P_641_COMMENT__ 21â1493

The Emancipation of Labour group was the first Russian Marxist
group. It was founded in Geneva by G.Â V. Plekhanov in 1883, and included
P.Â B. Axelrod, L.Â G. Deutsch, Vera Zasulich and V.Â N. Ignatov.  

The group did much to spread Marxism in Russia, and dealt a serious
blow at Narodism. At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. the group
announced its dissolution.

A St.Â Petersburg group of revolutionary Narodniks named after one of
its membersâN.Â V. Chaikovsky. Its aims were self-education and
revolutionary propaganda among the youth. It published and circulated works
by Karl Marx, N.Â G. Chernyshevsky, D.Â I. Pisarev, and N.Â Flerovsky
(V.Â V. Bervi); it had a printery of its own in Switzerland. Later the group
conducted revolutionary work among the workers and peasants, acquainted the
workers with the history of the international proletarian movement, and
sponsored the study in circles of the first volume of Marxâs
Capital. They failed, however, to understand the historical role
of the proletariat, regarding it merely as an intermediary between the
revolutionary intelligentsia and the peasantry. The groupâs activities came
to an end with the mass arrests of early 1874.

10/X.Â 00 

Dear Vasily Petrovich, 

I received your address and the resolution of the
twenty-three[2] against the âCredoâ from P.Â B. (Axelrod) only
yesterday. Alexei wrote long ago that you would be abroad, but I was unable
to locate you (foolish of him not to give you my postal address!). Please
get in touch with me and let me know in detail how you are getting on: how
long you have been in London, what you are doing, what the people are like
in London, what your plans are, and when you intend to leave Why did you
choose London?  

There are no passwords; instead of a password (for you do not know me,
do you?  How did Alexei refer to me when you spoke with him? Did he give
you a good enough idea of what we are doing?) I shall give you the initials
of the addressee through whom I am to write to Alexei. Alexei writes me: if
you cannot make out the address, ask

  Â  

Novosyolov. The initials are:
     K.Â A.Â G.Â G.[1]

âinsert

the missing letters and we shall have made âcontactâ.  

All the best,

 Petrov 

Reply to this address: 

Herrn Philipp RÃ¶gner, Cigarrenhandlung, Neue Gasse,
NÃ¼rnberg.  

Enclose second envelope addressed to Petrov.  


P.S. Please let me have two or three addresses of fully reliable people
(outsiders, not revolutionaries) to whom one could go in Poltava and find
out about Alexei.  
 

Notes

The person referred to has not been identified.âEd.  
 



[2]
The âresolution of the twenty-threeâ evidently was adopted
at a meeting of Social-Democrats in exile in Orlov, Vyatka Gubernia
(V.Â V. Vorovsky, N.Â E. Bauman, A.Â N. Potresov, and others), as an
expression of solidarity with the âprotest of the seventeenâ (âA Protest
by Russian Social-Democratsâ) written by Lenin (see present edition,
Vol.Â 4, pp.Â 167â82).

I clearly see two trends also in your letter to a friend:
one quite legitimately lays the stress on the need for economic struggle,
the need to be able to make use of the workersâ legal societies as well,
âto respond in diverse ways to the day-to-day vital needs of the
workersâ, and so on. All this is legitimate and correct. You are mistaken
if you think that the revolutionaries âare opposed to legal societiesâ,
that such societies are âhatefulâ to them, that they âturn their backs
on societyâ, and so on. The revolutionaries too recognise the necessity of
economic struggle, of responding also to the day-to-day vital needs, and of
learning to make use of legal societies as well. Not only have the
revolutionaries never and nowhere advised to turn oneâs back on
society, but on the contrary have stressed that it is essential for
Social-Democracy to take the lead in the social movement and to
unite under the leadership of the revolutionary Social-Democratic Party all
the democratic elements. However, it is imperative to take care that the
legal societies and purely economic organisations should not
separate the workersâ movement from Social-Democracy and revolutionary
political struggle, but that they should, on the contrary, link them as
closely and indissolubly as possible. But in your letter there is also
that tendency (a harmful and, in my opinion, thoroughly reactionary one),
the tendency to separate the workersâ movement from
Social-Democracy and revolutionary political struggleâto put off the
political tasks, to replace the

  Â  

concept âpolitical struggleâ with the concept âstruggle for legal
rightsâ, and so on.  

How to draw the line between the sound and useful tendency and the
harmful one?  I believe there is no need for me to persuade you who have
already had a taste of âmeetings abroadâ that we must not confine
ourselves to mere talk. And would it not be ridiculous to fear examination
of the question in print since it has already been discussed for a long
time in letters and debates. Why should debates at meetings and writing
letters be considered permissible and elucidation of controversial issues
in the press a âmost harmful thing capable only (???) of amusing our
enemiesâ? This I cannot understand. Only polemics in the press can
precisely establish the dividing line I am referring to, for some people
are often bound to go to extremes. Of course struggle in the press will
cause more ill feeling and give us a good many hard knocks, but we are not
so thin-skinned as to fear knocks! To wish for struggle without knocks,
differences without struggle, would be the height of naÃ¯vetÃ©, and if
the struggle is waged openly it will be a hundred times better
than foreign and Russian âGubarevismâ, and will lead, I repeat, a hundred
times faster to lasting unity.

Dear P.Â B., 

Forgive me for not replying to you in my letter to Bainova; ill health
interfered. But having consulted with V.Â I. I can see now that the
situation is very serious: we need the foreign news items, the first sheet
of the paper is already being printed, and the second is ready except for
the news
items.[2] The length of the news column should be some

  Â  

26,000
     characters.[1]

At a pinch we can throw out something else.  

In view of this, please send at once whatever you can. I shall
eagerly await your answer.  
Address:

Herrn Georg Rittmeyer.
KaiserstraÃe 53. o.
MÃ¼nchen (enclosure: fÃ¼r Meyer).


With best regards,

 Yours,

 Petroff 

You must excuse my insistence. But what else can I do? I hope that you
will see to this as you did with the article on Liebknecht.  

 
Notes
 

[1]
Rakovskyâs article of some 10,000 characters included.  âLenin
 



[2]
The publication in question is Iskra (The Spark), the first
all-Russia illegal Marxist newspaper, founded by Lenin in 1900. It played
the decisive role in the establishment of a revolutionary Marxist party of
the working class in Russia.  

The editors were Lenin, P.Â B. Axelrod, Vera Zasulich, Y.Â 0. Martov,
G.Â V. Plekhanov and A.Â N. Potresov. At first the Secretary of the Editorial
Board was Inna Smidovich-Lehmann, and from the spring of 1901, Nadezhda
Krupskaya, who also attended to all of Iskraâs correspondence with
Russian Social-Democratic organisations.  


After the Second Congress of the Party, beginning with issue No.Â 52,
the newspaper became the mouthpiece of the Mensheviks.

Dear Comrade,


We have already read the proofs of your article and it probably has been
printed, so that it is impossible to make any changes now. As for the deletion,
we did it. We of course would not presume to make any changes affecting the
essential ideas of the author without asking his per mission first. The given
deletion, however, was prompted by purely technical considerations. No editorial
office can relinquish the right to make cuts of this order. We were quite
certain that you would see yourself that the deletions we have made in no way
alter the autlThrâs train of thought or detract from the weightiness of
his arguments. We hope very much that you will not take this in bad part and
that you will continue your co-operation which we value so highly.


The agreement with the liberals which we hinted at in the previous
letter[1]

has
been
concluded.[2] We undertake the publication of a separate general
political supplement to Zarya which will also carry part of our current
mate rials. We trust that your
group[3] will lend a hand with this
supplement too. We shall shortly send you the announcement of its publication.


Have you heard anything about the Kiev
developments[4]?

  Â  

They say that 18 were killed there. Please let us know what
information you have.


Best regards,


Petrov

[2]
A reference to the talks between the Editorial Board of Iskra
and the liberals concerning the publication of Sovremennoye
Obozreniye (Contemporary Review) as a supplement to
Zarya. Announcements on the publication of the supplement were
issued by G.Â V. Plekhanov on behalf of Iskra and Zarya
and by P.Â B. Struve on behalf of the âdemocratic oppositionâ group. The
project was never realised, however, since Dietz refused to print the
announcements as not conforming to censorship requirements. Further talks
between the representatives of Iskra and Struve were interrupted
and never resumed (see present edition, Vol.Â 4, pp.Â 380â82; Vol.Â 36,
pp.Â 67, 71; Lenin, Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Ed., Vol.Â 4,
pp.Â 389â90).





[3]
The Borba group (D.Â B. Ryazanov, Y.Â M. Steklov,
E.Â L. Gurevich) originated in Paris in the summer of 1900 and took shape as
an independent group in 1901, after the âUnityâ Conference. In
its publications it distorted Marxist theory, rejected the revolutionary
tactics of Iskra, and was opposed to Leninâs principles of Party
organisation. Owing to its deviations from Social-Democratic views and
tactics, its disruptive actions and lack of contact with Social-Democratic
organisations in Russia, the group was not admitted to the Second Congress
of the R.S.D.L.P., which decided to dissolve it.





[4]
A reference to student demonstrations in protest against the
introduction of the provisional rules of July 29,1899, and the drafting of
183 students of the Kiev University into the army (see present edition,
Vol.Â 4, pp.Â 414â19). A meeting of the Russian colony in London held on
FebruaryÂ 6, 1901, adopted a protest against this action by the government,
which was published in the journal Nakanune No.Â 26â27 under the
title âLondon Protestâ.

Thanks for the letter and the detailed analysis of Iskra. Thorough and
well-argumented appraisals pointing out slips (inevitable in such a difficult
job as this) are so rare that one appreciates them doubly. Your interest in
Iskra reinforces my hope that we shall work together for it.


I fully agree with you that the review of home develop ments is skimpy. In the
second issue it is better, but skimpy nonetheless. It is one of the most
difficult sections, and only gradually can it be put on a satisfactory footing.


As regards contributions from correspondents, you are not quite right, in my
opinion. The coincidence with
Rabochaga Mysl[3] No.Â 10

incidentally, I have not seen the issue; please send it to
me

does not bother me.


It shows that we too have contacts with the St.Â Petersburg League,ie and that
is a very good thing.


Your interpretation of the advice âto be carefulâ con tained in the
item about the
crisis[4] is in my view erro neous and far-fetched. It
is clear from the context that the warning is only against
strikes, and since next to this it is pointed out that strikes are not
the only means of strug gle, that it is necessary in these difficult times to
use other methods of struggle: propaganda (âto explainâ) and agita
tion (âto prepare for more resoluteâN.B.âstruggleâ), I
categorically protest against comparing the call âto be carefulâ
with the Rabochaya Mysi kind of thinking. The advice âto be
carefulâ when it comes to strikes and to

  Â  

prepare for more resolute struggle is the exact opposite of the
Rabochaya Mysl position. Your point about demonstrations is fully
justified, but, first, this enters precisely into the broader concept of
âmore resolute struggleâ; second, it would be out of place to make this
call more concrete and definite since there is no direct occasion for such
action and it is impossible to assess the overall situation in detail. In
issue No.Â 2, in a commentary on one particular strike and an item in
Yuzhny
Rabochy,[5] an attempt is made to be more definite on this score.


I cannot agree that the demand for state unemployment insurance could
serve to stir the workers into action. I doubt whether this is right in
principle: in a class state unemployment insurance can hardly amount to
more than a deception. From the standpoint of tactics, it is especially out
of place in Russia, since our state is fond of experiments in
âetatisationâ, loves to advertise them as being for the âcommon goodâ,
and we should resolutely oppose any extension of the functions of the
present state and work for more freedom for public initiative. Aid
and benefits for the unemployed are all right, but âstate insuranceââ?


Your point that the article about Zubatov is not quite rounded out is
perhaps
justified.[6] 

As for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Decembristsâthis really
was
an omission.[7] 


If you wish, I can get you a Bulgarian passport. Write me if you
need it, and if so, let me have the particulars for Identification.


The transport situation has improved and we may be able to manage
without the help of new people.  

Please send me âRabochaya Myslâ, and also
Byloye[8] and other London publications. I would also
like to have a catalogue of publications put out by the Fabian Society and
other socialist firms. Which British newspaper would you recommend? Can you
send me a couple of issues as samples? I subscribed to
Justice[9] but was not satisfied with it.  

I havenât got four copies of Iskra at the moment. We shall get
them soon. Why, incidentally, must you have

  Â  

them? Do not forget that under no circumstances can it be
circulated abroad. The copy sent you is only for you and your
friend[1]

;

in general, for the time being, it must remain strictly a secret.  

With best regards,

 Petrov 

I am sending you our pamphlet as
well.[2]

So far also only for you, confidentially.  

Please let us know your opinion.  

When are you planning to go to Russia? Before you go, we must see each
other. Couldnât you come over for a week or
so?[10] How are you off for earnings and finances in general?  

Once more, best regards,

 Yours,

 Petroff

Rabochaya Mysl (Workersâ Thought)âa newspaper published by
the Economists from October 1897 to December 1902. It was edited by
K.Â M. Takhtarev and others.





[4]
An unsigned item printed in Iskra No.Â 1 in the âOur Public
Lifeâ column. It cautioned workers against unorganised strikes in the
crisis conditions then prevailing, for the employers seized upon them as a
pretext for wholesale dismissals.





[5]
Yuzhny Rabochy (Southern Worker)âan illegal
Social-Democratic newspaper published by a group of the same name from
January 1900 to April 1903. At the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. the
delegates from this group took a Centrist position.  

The Second Congress dissolved the Yuzhny Rabochy group along
with all other Social-Democratic groups and organisations Which had
functioned independently.  

The reference is to reports on a strike at the Prokhorov mines (on the
Donets) carried by Iskra No.Â 2 (February 1901) and Yuzhny
Rabochy No.Â 3 (November 1900).





[6]

V.Â P. Nogin had suggested that L.Â Martovâs article âNew Friends of the
Russian Proletariatâ should end in a more pointed analogy between the
preachments of S.Â V. Zubatov and the treatment of economic struggle in the
programme of Rabochaya Mysl.





[7]

V.Â P. Nogin had pointed out that although Iskra had chosen as
its motto words first used by the Decembrists, it made no mention of the
uprising of DecemberÂ 14, 1825.





[8]
Byloye (The Past)â-an historical journal devoted mostly to
the history of Narodism and earlier social movements, published in 1900â04
and 1906â07, first abroad, them in St.Â Petersburg.





[9]
Justiceâa weekly published in London from January 1884 to
the beginning of 1925; organ of the SocialâDemocratic Federation and,
from 1911, of the British Socialist Party. From February 1925 to December
1933 it was published under the name of Social-Democrat.





[10]
On his way to Russia in May 1901, V.Â P. Nogin spent a week in Munich
where he discussed with Lenin the work to be conducted in Russia.

Thanks for the newspapers. Within the next few days I shall send you
Iskra No.Â 2âalso strictly in secret.  

Could you make an inquiry at the
Nakanune[2] office. A sum of money and three postage stamps
were sent there (in the name of Dr. K.Â Lehmann) as far back as
October31 to pay for the mailing of the paper. But not a word has
been heard from them since then!  

Please send me a copy of the protest against the drafting of students
for military service. It would be interesting to

Alexei promises to come soon.

11/III. 01 

Dear P.Â B., 

I received your letter today (together with a copy of the
over-laudatory opinion of the
Parisians[2]) and am hurrying to send you another copy of
       No.Â 2.[1]

How could I not have noticed that the copy sent you was so poor? As a
matter of fact, I had absolutely no choice then.  

Leiteisenâs article, in my opinion, is not quiteÂ ... but it evidently
will nevertheless do. Others seem to have found it better than I did.  

I havenât the slightest idea of Shouer. I shall ask others.  

I am sending you the copies of
Weltpolitik[3] I happen to have. If you need all the issues,
you probably will have to get in touch with the author himself who again
was obliging enough to give his address.  

The last sheet of Zarya has been proof-read. Soon now....


Alexei wanted to write about the twentieth anniversary

  Â  

of MarchÂ 1. I donât know whether he did. I am expecting him shortly.  

With best regards,

 Yours,

 Petrov

I am sending you 5Â copies of Iskra No.Â 2 for distribution and
sale. If you can use them to collect some money we will be very much
obliged to you. We need money badly. Perhaps you could also take steps
through London to promote circulation and collection of funds?  

I am expecting Alexei any day now. He received his passport and was to
have left at the end of last week.  

Zarya should be sent to you in a few days from Stuttgart.


Best regards,

 Yours....

AprilÂ 22 

Since the red-print leaflets are to be forwarded to St.Â Petersburg the
valise containing them should be sent in that direction (to Pskov, not to
Smolensk or Poltava).  

We are sending 100 marks as a loan to the Berlin
group.[2] It would be desirable to collect the money needed for
delivering the valises on the spot and to relieve Iskra of this
expense. Do everything you can to raise the money, for we are very short of
funds.  

As regards your leaving the neutral group, you know best what to do. It
might perhaps be better to wait, since you might be able to win others to
our side.  

The stamp has been ordered. Let us have the Vienna address again, the
one you sent looks queer.  

As regards sending consignments through the Polish Social-Democrat, you
should accept his offer and do your best to give him a pood or two of
literature at the earliest possible date for trial shipment. How much
literature do you have on hand? We shall send you the
balanceâZarya and (after MayÂ 1) Iskra No.Â 3.  

You did not let us know how much open literature you have
received. Send us a detailed account.

The letter refers to the Iskra promotion group founded in
Berlin in the autumn of 1900. The group played a major role in the
organisation of the transport of the paper to Russia and the collection of
funds. Similar groups were set up in other European cities (Geneva, Zurich,
Paris, etc.) where there were student youth and revolutionary emigrants
from Russia. They collected funds for Iskra, arranged for the
shipment of illegal publications to Russia, obtained passports, established
contacts and carried on other work for Iskra.  

The neutral group of Social-Democrats in Berlin formed around
V.Â A. Bazarov in the autumn of 1900. Its aim was to overcome the split
between the supporters of the journal Rabocheye Dyelo and the
Emancipation of Labour group, which developed following he Second Congress
of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad. Among others, the group
included M.Â G. Vecheslov and I.Â B. Basovsky. According to Bazarov, the
group sent its representatives to Geneva early in 1900 to persuade the
Iskra and Sotsial-Demokrat organisations to effect a
reconciliation with the Union. The group published three or four
proclamations on political topics and existed until the summer of 1901.

12/V. 01 

Dear Comrades, 

Being, as before, supporters of unity in principle, we re peat our
agreement to resume unity talks and gratefully accept the offer made by the
Borba group to take the initiative and mediate in the preliminary
phase of the talks. We agree to the holding of a preliminary conference of
the Social-Democratic organisations you name.  

We believe it is in place to add that we cannot of course end the
polemics over issues of principle which we started with Rabocheye
Dyelo.  

Respectfully, on behalf of the Iskra group....


We would ask you to let us know as soon as possible whether all
concerned have agreed to the idea of the
conference.[2] We can definitely promise to take part in May, but a
later date would involve some difficulty for us.  
 

Notes

See NoteÂ 13.





[2]
A conference of representatives of S.D. organisations abroad was held
in Geneva in June 1901. It drew up a resolution recognising the need to
consolidate all the Social-Democratic forces of Russia on the basis of the
revolutionary principles of Iskra and to unite the
Social-Democratic organisations abroad, and condemning opportunism of all
varieties and shades: Economism, Bernsteinism, Millerandism, etc. (see
KPSS v rezolutsiyakh i resheniyakh syezdov, konferentsii i plenumov
Tsentralnogo Komiteta [C.P.S.U. in Resolutions and Decisions of Its
Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee],
PartÂ 1, 1954, pp.Â 22â24). After the conference the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats Abroad and its organ, the journal Rabocheye
Dyelo, intensified their efforts to propagate opportunism, making it
impossible for the supporters of Iskra to unite with those of
Rabocheye Dyelo, and thereby predetermined the failure of the
âUnityâ Conference.

We of course agree with your plan to begin publication of
bulletins[1] at once. Only it is necessary to work out the
organisational aspects of the scheme, that is, to settle some inevitable
preliminary questions. For instance, will the entire Iskra
promotion group in Berlin be involved in publishing and editing the
bulletins (if I am not mistaken, the idea was not to inform the whole group
of our organisational plan as yet), or just a part of it, or a few
individuals? Will the title of the bulletins indicate their relationship

  Â  

to Iskra or not? It would also be desirable that the programme of
the bulletins should accord with the programme put forward in our draft and
that the editors should see to it that the departments (translations of
Polish, Finnish and other literature) are distributed among Iskra
sympathisers and supporters. Lastly, it is essential definitely to decide
(the decision of course should not be published) that the group publishing
and editing the bulletins under take the task provisionally with a view to
turning it over to an elected Literary Commission when the Iskra
organisation abroad which we have proposed has been openly
constituted. There are also other matters which you of course will see for
yourself and settle when you get down to working out your plan
organisationally in its final form.  

We on our part shall select some material we have on hand and send it
to you. Let us know when you plan to put out the first issue. Will the
bulletins you propose to publish be the same as the earlier ones (as
regards format) or different?  
 

Notes

The Berlin Iskra promotion group planned to put out bulletins
but the idea was never realised owing to lack of funds and material.

24.V. 01 

Dear Leiteisen, 

As regards Muzykant, we believe that since he se met Ã  notre
 disposition[1]

and is an enterprising man, it is of course necessary to try and send him
at once to the very frontier to take direct charge of the
consignments, and not only to take charge but to attend personally to
conveying them across (respective: to cross the frontier with a smuggler).


Since he agrees, he should be given 200Â frs. (that is, the 100+100 you
wrote about) and probably sent to us. We were wondering whether he
should come here or just go to Berlin to talk things over there with our
representative, but have arrived at the conclusion that he will have to
take a trip here; we have a number of more or less certain contacts at the
frontier and near it, and without thorough consultation with the person who
is to go there we cannot decide exactly where he should go and what
âpretextâ to choose.  

We are now short of money and have to be very thrifty; we cannot afford
to spend on anything but transportation. But if Muzykant gets there on
these 200Â frs. and lives on

  Â  

them for some time he will probably be able with the help of our contacts
to begin deliveries at once.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. Ryazanov is here and we have been discussing the plan for our
organisation with him. At first he rejected our plan categorically and
âresentfullyâ, but then, after the proviso was inserted that all this was
temporary, for one year, he agreed conditionally on his
own behalf but assured us that Nevzorov would not agree on any
account (?). There is alsoâjust in caseâanother plan: a federation
of Sotsial Demokrat, Zarya and Borba, with the
last-mentioned, putting out only pamphlets (not a paper), participating in
an advisory capacity in the work of Zarya and
Iskra, contributing, like the other members, its share to the
federationâs treasury, raising funds independently by arranging socials,
etc. What do you think of this latter project? To me it seems unfairâit
grants too much to Borbaâand I doubt whether it would be
acceptable to all.  

Generally speaking we believe that an understanding can be reached with
Borba too; they also seem to be ready to make concessions seeing
that we have no intention of giving up our position.  

Yours,
 Lenin

The group publishing and editing Iskra and Zarya
turns to you as one who took part together with us in one of the

  Â  

first Marxist publishing
undertakings,[2] and who has always sympathised with the political
activity of Social-Democracy, with a request for financial assistance. The
future of the entire business now largely depends on such
assistance, for the initial funds have been used up in getting started and
it will take at least a year of full-scale work for the enterprise to begin
paying for itself. In the spring of last year (1900) one of us had a talk
with your friend (whom you probably now often see) who also expressed
confidence that you would not refuse to help. We hoped that with your
connections you would be able to collect a substantial lump sum, though our
organisation is of course in need of periodical contributions as well.

A few words, dear G.Â V., to let you know that the article by Orthodox
against Berdayev was sent to the printers today. We propose to run it
second, after your editorial. Let us have a headline for
it as soon as possible, for it is now quite âheadlessâ.  

We had a bit of an argument over it with Arsenyev and Velika.... They
found the sallies against Kistyakovsky (2x2=5) and the end concerning the
âbourgeoisnessâ of Berdayev to be
      plump....[1]


All the best,

We received your letter. Let us know the exact date when you can go
yourself or send someone for the valise (to KÃ¶nigsberg or Berlin). When
the literature has been picked up it should be taken toÂ X at the following
    address:Â ....[2]

30/VII. 01 

Dear P.Â B., 

I received âLiebknechtâ and
Vorbote.[3] Many, many thanks!  

First a few words about a special matter. We have decided to arrange a
meeting with the author of âThe Rebirth of Revolutionism in
     Russiaâ,[1]

but under no circumstances in Munich. We chose Zurich, so that our delegate
(it is proposed that I should go) could also meet you on the same trip. The
meeting is planned for August 8â10 (before the 12th),
new style.  

Please let us know whether you can allow us to use your flat for the
meeting and whether you can be in Zurich at the time so that we could meet
(or, rather, whether I can take a trip to see you, for why should you do
any travelling

  Â  

since you are under medical care? For me, needless to say, it is no trouble
at all).  

The gentleman in question will come to your flat (we shall instruct him
accordingly through Alexeiâs sister in Geneva, unless you think otherwise),
introduce himself as Sokolovsky and ask you (or your wife) for the
Iskra representative. Alexeiâs sister will wire me when he will
leave, and I shall come to Zurich in good time, concealing from him (we
fear to trust him too much) my whereabouts.  

We have seen the Narodnaya Volya journal Vestnik Russkoi
Revolutsii[4] (Ryazanov showed us a copy) but have not received it
ourselves, promises notwithstanding. I glanced through only the editorial
and a review of Iskra (favourable, but for terrorism). We
should be getting it soon, and so should you.  

We received the foreword by Kautsky. Your remarks concerning my
       article[2]

in the letter my sister received today made your attitude much clearer to
me. I hope we shall still have a chance to talk about this, andâau
revoir!  

Yours,
 Petroff 

G.Â V. writes that you will see him. When do you intend to go? We can
hasten the trip to Zurich to meet Sokolovsky if you plan to leave soon.

We sent you a telegramâthe meaning was quite clearâagreement. But
bear in mind that communication by

  Â  

wire is very dangerous, for they take copies of telegrams. Try confining
yourself to the post. There is no need to come over to discuss details. All
that can be arranged by letter. Do you happen to have an experienced
printer? If so, mats, which are easy to send (in journals, etc.), can be
used. The advantages of this method are:
1) no type is needed,
1a) it is far quicker,
2) less people, which means greater safety in underground work,
3) the paper will have a foreign look, which too is a big advantage from
the stand point of secrecy. By way of experiment we shall send you shortly
matrices enclosed in book binding, addressed to
K....[2]

Open them carefully, try them out and let us know the results as soon as
you can. A universal stereotyper for making type-casts from matrices costs
about 300Â marks, but whether one can be freely obtained in Russia we do not
know. Let us know what the size of your machine is. Can it print sheets the
size of our Iskra? In general, send us at the earliest date some
sample of your work.  

If you have the technical facilities, try to put out as soon as
possible at least one complete issue of Iskra (if you find it
difficult to print an 8-page paper, such as NoÂ Â 6, at least put out
No.Â 5âitâs four pages). It would be extremely important for us to have a
copy of the Russian edition of Iskra in time for the
conference[4] here, that is, within a month (at most a month and a
half).  

Since when are we 800Â rubles in debt? Our funds are now low and the
debt can be covered only if your printing facilities actually turn out at
least three to five thousand copies of Iskra (4â8 pages) a
month. If you manage to do that there will of course be a net income.  

Where did you send the packages you received? Why send 5Â poods to
Yekaterinoslav? We do not risk sending more than a pood or two as a first
try; it doesnât matter if it costs more. Can consignments to Yekaterinoslav
be marked
    âBÃ¼cherâ[3]

?

How long does delivery take? This is

  Â  

very important. When writing addresses, separate the words, otherwise you
canât tell the name apart from the town and street.

A reference to the âUnityâ Conference of R.S.D.L.P. organisations
abroad held October 4â5, 1901, in Zurich. It was attended by 6Â members of
the Iskra and Zarya organisation abroad, 8Â members of the
Sotsial-Demokrat organisation (including 3Â members of the
Emancipation of Labour group), 16Â members of the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats (including 5Â members of the Bundâs Committee Abroad), and
3Â members of the Borba group. On the first item on the agenda,
âAgreement in Principle and Instructions to Editorial Boardsâ, Lenin
delivered an eloquent speech, censuring the opportunist activity of the
Union. When the opportunist amendments and addenda to the June resolution
adopted by the Third Congress of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats were
announced at the conference, the revolutionary section of the conference
(members of the Iskra and Zarya and the Sotsial
Demokrat organisations) read out a statement saying that unity was
impossible and left the conference. On Leninâs initiative these
organisations in October 1901 united into the League of Russian
Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad.

To Akim 

Dear Comrade, 

We were very glad indeed to receive your parcel. A
magnificent job; even Tsvetov says so. You misunderstood us. We were not at
all against the publication of Iskra in Russia. On the contrary,
we are fully aware that the business will benefit greatly by it, and a I
ways wanted this to be done, but we confess we had little faith in the
success of the undertaking. Now you have given us that faith. We are
sending you an article byÂ X intended for Zarya No.Â 2, but in our
opinion it would be very useful to put it out as a pamphlet. You will
probably agree with us when you read it. Print 1,000 copies of it. There
will be no more delays with material. Let us know when you want the copy
for the next pamphlet. Later on we shall send material for the
paper.[1]

We repeat, we are very glad indeed.  

There will be an item in No.Â 7 about the Veto mythâitâs
all sheer nonsense.  

You are quite right when you write that Iskra
should organise. But you are wrong in saying an organisation should have
been left behind in Russia.  

To do this, so to speak, in advance was out of the
question; only when things get under way will it be possible to tell how
the organisation should shape. Nowâand here you are rightâthere is
chaos (partly due to the method of delivery), most of our representatives
write to us about this. We are thinking of sending the project we have
drawn up for an organisation to two or three people in Russia for
consideration, and working out the rules for the organisation with their
help. We have not received the Odessa leaflets. Please send them.  
 


[[BOX-ENDS:

Your new acquaintance whom you met here sends on his own behalf three
cheers to you on this
     success!!!]][2]

 

Notes
 

[1]
It would he extremely important for us to have a Russian edition of
Iskra as soon as possible. If you are not quite up to it, put out
separate articles from the paper.  âLenin

4/VIII. 01 

Dear P.Â B., 

We received your letter of the 30th and, today, your letter from
Niedelbad informing us that the meeting can be arranged at your place. I am
very glad. I hope we shall see each other this week and have a good talk,
and therefore shall confine myself to a brief note on âbusinessâ.  

I wrote today via Stuttgart to a man named Finn in Zurichâit
was a letter of recommendation to you. My wife and sister knew this Finn
(slightly) in Russia (before his arrest). He created the
impression of a superficial person, but there were no grounds to doubt his
honesty. He was picked up in the Moscow
affair[2] together with the notorious traitor Ruma and was
exiled to Astrakhan. Other Astrakhan exiles (well known to us) likewise did
not question his honesty, all the more so since Finn was one of the
first to identify Ruma as a traitor.  

Going abroad after exile, Finn stayed for a time in Berlin where our
representatives evidently were friendly with him at first, but then parted
company with him, and yesterday I got an unexpected letter from a
Berliner saying that Finn âdoes not observe Party ethicsâ, that âhe
makes a repulsive impressionâ, that he âknew of Rumaâs relations with
Zubatovâ, that although they do not think Finn is a spy they recommend
caution.  

Astounded by this letter, we carried caution so far that

  Â  

I did not even see
 Finn[1]

(Alexei, without revealing that he was in on things, merely told him where
the rendezvous was to take place), instead my wife saw him and told him
that I was living in Stuttgart and was there at the
moment.  

Because of this I wrote to him through Stuttgart, and would ask you to
keep up the fiction.  

Finn is a writer of sorts. I believe that Alexei and I made a mistake
in not seeing him and going into the affair personally. Apparently Finn
parted company with the Berliners because he would not agree to their
demand: to give Iskra the full story of the Ruma
affair. This aroused their suspicion. Finn told my wife that he could not
do it be cause Ruma would then have direct evidence of his, Finnâs,
connections with the illegal press. Instead Finn gave my wife a note of a
few lines saying that there is no doubt about Rumaâs dealings with
Zubatov.  

To get to the bottom of all this, I shall write at once to my sister,
who knew Finn before his arrest and met him in Moscow. I shall ask her to
reply both to me and directly to you. You, on your part, please
talk to Finn and sound him out, and besides, if it is not inconvenient,
detain him in Zurich for a couple of extra days so that I could also see
him (it will be much more convenient there than here) and try to correct
the mistake I made because of the shocking letter from Berlin.  

Finn proposes to go on to G.Â V. Give him a brief note to G.Â V. and at
the same time send this letter to G.Â V. so that he should be informed.


Once again au revoir,

 Yours,

 Petrov

18/1X. 01 

Dear G.Â V., 

I have just made the inserts you wanted in your article against
Bernstein, and also broken it up into sections. I am very much afraid that
the division is not too successful (and the same applies to the insertion
of the note about Kautsky). But you can easily correct this in the
proofs.  

I also wish to draw your attention to my insertions on p.Â 77 of the
manuscript (reverse side) and (on p.Â 78) in place of the deletion. Perhaps
all this should be smoothed out in general.  

Your article against Bernstein is already being set up. We shall send
you the manuscript together with the proofs so that you can see the
insertions I made.  

I am enclosing a letter for Rachinsky.  

Nothing has been heard from you for quite some time. Are you well? Are
you planning to visit Pavel Borisovich, and when?  

I am working rather hard on my âagrarianâ
       article,[1]

which is growing terribly long.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Petrov

22/X.Â 01 

Dear L.Â I., 

Forgive me for not replying at once and for being very brief: Iâve
again caught something like influenza and my head is absolutely no good. In
my opinion, if no account of the conference can be compiled we should do
the following: all the documents and statements submitted at the conference
to the bureau (the
Geneva[1]

resolutions, the amendments to them, the statement of the Union and our
statement on the Bund, our declaration on withdrawal, etc.) should be
printed consecutively, none of the speeches need be given (not
even mentioned, to say nothing of a detailed account), just link
the documents with a couple of words. It seems to me that the documents are
so eloquent and speak for themselves so clearly that it is enough to print
them (merely indicating how, in what order and on what issues they were
submitted or read out) for all sensible people fully to understand why we
walked
out.[2] 

If you do not have the questions submitted by Frey, ask Leiteisen and
Dan; they may have them.  

Try to confine yourself to such a comparison of documents and send the
result as soon as possible to Geneva;

  Â  

they will print them there and perhaps make some minor amendments if such
are needed.  

Best regards,

 Yours....

conference they were secretaries from the Iskra and Zarya
organisation.

10.XI.Â 01 

Dear Leiteisen, 

I saw the
      gentleman[1]

to whom you revealed a
League[5] secret and who is now raising a fuss.  

I must say that you made a rather big mistake.  

First, why did you speak about this gentleman to Leibov and Wasserberg,
who are not members of the League?? He complains particularly
bitterly about this. And he is right. The attitude of the League towards
third persons should be known only to League members. I think you
ought to tell Leibov and Wasserberg off properly and not trust them so much
in the future: if you found it possible to tell them, they should have kept
silent without fail.  

Second, why didnât you put an end to the affair at once, thereby
preventing the gentleman from making the trip to see G.Â V. and
us??  After all, you are an official functionary, a member of the
administration. You should have therefore accepted from the
gentleman whatever statement he wanted to submit, and after discussing it
with others, given him a proper collective answer. You should have told him
that he could contact the League only through you and that hence
he was obliged to submit to you what ever complaints he
had against the League in general or one of its members in particular and
had no right to take the matter up with the wrong people (G.Â V. or us).


As I see it, you departed from the rules (according to

  Â  

which all complaints are to be dealt with by the administration) and are
guilty, besides indiscretion, of failure to exercise your authority.  

Well, so much for that. Do not be offended by my frankness. Now lâincident est
     clos.[2]

We, needless to say, told the gentleman this: we do not advise you to turn
to the League concerning yourself (i.e., to ask whether the League trusts
you, etc.). There is no point in doing that. The League is not obliged to
reply. What you ought to do is this: do everything you can to
throw light on the Ruma affair (in all its aspects), collect
all the evidence and ask the League to review the case and publish
the findings (i.e., the accusation against Ruma and,
  eventuellement,[3]

the exoneration of others).  

He agreed that this was the only way to go about it and set to work
putting down his own testimony. If you know of any other
witnesses, take steps yourself to get their evidence.  

And so our tactics now are: within the League, a reserved
attitude towards the âgentlemanâ for the time being. But not a
word about it outside the League, or even to the more aloof
members of the League. Nâest ce
    pas?[4]


Yours,
 Frey

The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad
was founded on Leninâs initiative in October 1901 as an organisation
uniting revolutionary Marxists abroad. After the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. the Mensheviks gained control in the League and in October 1903,
after its Second Congress, the Bolsheviks left it and founded their own
organisation abroad.

14.XI.Â 01 

Dear Leiteisen, 

I hasten to reply at once to your letter which I just received.  
 

Really, you are not being quiteÂ ... objective about the
âincidentâ. Since you did disclose a secret to a not too discreet person,
some measure of indiscretion there evidently was. Of course, this can
happen to anyone, and please do not think that I am repeating this for any
other reason than to close the incident once and for all. But you must
admit that we had some very unpleasant moments and explanations to
face not through any fault of our own, for it was not we who told
Leib... things that could not but make the âgentlemanâ blow up.  

And now as to the substance of the matter. Once the âgentlemanâ
learned (in whatever way) that the League had decided against him (or that
a League member had voiced the opinion that it was necessary to take a
reserved attitude toward him, that is, the
    âgentlemanâ,[1]

which amounts to the same thing), the League was involved in the
affair. This is something that cannot be undone, any more than you can
recapture a word that has been spoken.  

And for heavenâs sake do not add another mistake to the first: do not
say now that âthe League has nothing to do with itâ!  

The League is already involved, and the only question now is
how to disentangle it.  

The âgentlemanâ wanted to apply to the League concerning
himself (you evidently did not quite understand me on this score),
i.e., concerning the grounds on which League members had cast aspersions on
him.  

We persuaded him that nobody had cast any âaspersionsâ, and as
regards its reservations, the League is not accountable to anyone.  

This finishes the personal question concerning the
âgentlemanâ. But there still remains the public question of the Ruma
affair, about which we have long been receiving letters urging that it be
cleared up.  

The reservations in relation to the âgentlemanâ were as a matter of
fact due to his âinvolvementâ in this affair.  

Therefore, the âgentlemanâ had to be advised to under take an
âinquest and investigationâ of all aspects of the Ruma affair.  
 

Since he agreed to do so, it is up to us to help him; first, because it
is unquestionably in the interests of the movement to throw full
light on the methods used and the web woven by the provocateur Ruma;
secondly, because we League members are a little bit to blame for the fact
that the League caused the âgentlemanâ so much trouble, which he may
not have fully deserved.  

You must agree that it is our right and duty to have reservations as
regards X, Y and Z, but X, Y and Z should not be told about them. Once the
âsinâ has been committed there is nothing for it, you know, but to own
up.  

We should not add one mistake to another by saying that it is ânone of
our businessâ now, after we ourselves brought things out into the
open....  

Yours,
 Frey 

P.S. Greetings to Yefron. Is he pleased with the out come of the
conference and the establishment of the League?

19.XI.Â 01 

Iâm afraid, dear G.Â V., that Iâm giving you no peace with my letters. I
seem to be bombarding you every day.  

I sent you the article âThe Present Industrial
      Crisisâ.[1]

I believe it isnât bad and could go into Zarya No.Â 4 with some
slight changes. Please read it as soon as you have a free moment
and give your opinion. If you approve of it, we shall have it set up in
type very soon (in a week and a half or so) so that Dietzâs
printery should not stand idle. Perhaps Koltsov would agree to help edit
the article if necessary?  
 

As regards printing the documents of the conference the majority has
already declared for immediate publication (Vel.Â Dm., Blumenfeld,
two Berlin members, and myself, i.e., five out of the nineâthe six
editors and three administrators). In other words, that question is
decided. Let B.Â Abr. hurry as much as possible.  

Do you happen to have an extra copy of the Russian edition of âWhat
Next?â We havenât a single one. Please send it.  

Yours,
 Frey

17/XII.Â 01 

Dear L.Â I., 

Received three letters from you and am replying to them all. I
definitely cannot
come[2]: the whole paper now rests on me and the administrative end has
been complicated by transport hitches and mix-ups in Russia, and my
pamphlet is pressing on
 me.[1]

I am devilishly late! And I am altogether unprepared; I even asked Berg to
write the item for Iskra No.Â 13, for I have read nothing on the
history of our revolutionary movement for a very long time. I think you are
mistaken in assuming that you will not do because of public sentiment. The
Plekhanov anniversary is so specific a celebration that it most
likely will be attended only by people of very definite trend and
sentiment.  

Address for letters to Tsvetov (Blumenfeld):

Herrn Dittrich Buchbinder.
SchwanthalerstraÃe 44.
MÃ¼nchen.
 

I give you this address because if you write through me your letters to
him may be delayed for two whole days. He lives at the other end
of town and we see each other rarely.  

The âstrangeâ letter with the inquiry concerning Mrs.Â D. should have
been sent not to Blumenfeld but to the address enclosed in the same letter.


Best regards,

 Yours,

 Frey

Dear G.Â V., 

I forgot to ask you to do the following: please Look among your papers
for a letter my wife sent you concerning the article
âThe Workersâ Party and the
   Peasantryâ[1]

(three or four close-written sheets of letter paper, without heading or
signature).  

You havenât given your opinion as regards printing it in
Zarya. I would like to remind you of it, so that you should not
forget to send it to us without fail before
leaving[3] (or to bring it along).  

Please write when you plan to leave and expect to arrive here.  

Berg is said to have scored a success in Paris. But the Union crowd in
Russia have achieved absolutely nothing! This is the very time to crush
them.  

I am writing a
      pamphlet[2]

against them, and I get angrier

  Â  

and angrier as I go on.  The only trouble is that my pamphlet is getting
too fat!  

Yours,
 Frey

Dear P.Â B., 

The letter was sent not registered to your address a couple of weeks
 ago.[1]

If possible, put in an inquiry at the post office, perhaps enclosing an
envelope addressed in my handwriting, in case this might help.  

Of course it would be better for G.Â V. to call on the way back. I sent
him money for the fare. You must have received Zarya, of course.


Could you now look through my pamphlet (or book?) against the
Economists?  If you can, Iâll send you half of it in a day or two or early
next week, for I would like to have your advice. Drop me a line.  

Hoping to see you soon,

 Yours,

3/I.  

We have received a letter from Kiev criticising the actions
of the committee. It says that
(1) the committee is insufficiently informed (there were arrests on the
night of DecemberÂ 1, hut the committee is unable to ascertain who were
arrested and why), and that it is slow in taking action.
(2) A leaflet addressed to the workers should have been put out reporting
the student unrest and indicating a course of action to the workers. The
committee agreed that such a leaflet was needed, hut did not issue it on
time. We propose to print the letter in our issue No.Â 14, which comes out
in 10 daysâ time. In view of this, reply at once whether you have
any objections on either score, or send in your own account of the
circumstances connected with these facts.
In general the letter is an interesting one, but we would not wish to
publish criticism of the actions of a friendly committee without hearing
its opinion. Please answer
      promptly.[1]

Once again zur Frage (on the question) of Krichevsky.  G.Â V. says that
in the Paris colony it was stubbornly maintained that this Boris
Krichevsky had received a letter of thanks from Millerand (for his
contributions to
VorwÃ¤rts[1]) and that he had at one time even
boasted about it. So now that a polemic has started between
VorwÃ¤rts and
Zarya[2] and the question has been put point-blank, it is
necessary to exert at once every effort to make a most thorough
investigation (trial âby ordealâ) of the affair. Please tackle the matter
at once. Collect evidence from all witnesses, both those who saw something
and those who heard about it, and having done so, write
us giving the names of all these witnesses and their testimony. As a last
resort you should turn to Petit, though it would be better not to âscare
the quarryâ but to catch them before they suspect attack.  

And so, to work! With full force!  

Awaiting your reply,

 Yours,

 Frey 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
VorwÃ¤rtsâa daily, central organ of the German
Social-Democratic Party, published in Berlin since 1891. In the late
nineties, after the death of Engels, it fell into the bands of the Right
wing of the party and regularly printed articles by opportunists. Giving a
tendentious picture of the struggle against opportunism and revisionism in
the R.S.D.L.P., it supported the Economists, and later, after the split in
the Party, the Mensheviks.





[2]
The polemic referred to was between the editors of VorwÃ¤rts,
Central Organ of the German Social-Democratic Party, Karl Kautsky, and
Zarya over the article âThe LÃ¼beck Parteitag of German
Social-Democracyâ by Martov (Ignotus) in Zarya No.Â 2â3, December
1901.

17.IV. 02 

Dear G. V., 

I have another request to make of you. Please drop a line to Quelch
asking his assistance in a matter on which he has already been approached
by a friend of mine (with a letter from Velika Dm.) and today by myself:
ask him to do everything he possibly can and tell him it is very
important. You may write to him in French. Such a letter would help me very
much with the arrangements, which are well under way and need only to be
completed.  

Here, in case you need it, is his address:


Mr. H. Quelch.
37 A. Clerkenwell Green.
London E. C.


In the meantime you can write to me at Alexeyevâs address, he lives two
steps away. I hope to be finally settled in a week.  

Best regards,

 Yours....  

P.S. Vel. Dm. is perfectly right: at first glance this London makes a
foul impression!!  

Is your compositor ready to come over here?  

Where are Berg and Vel. Dm., and do you happen to know when the former
is leaving?  

I sent you the agrarian books with Vel. Dmitr. Did you get them?

18.IV.Â 02 

Dear P.Â B., 

I take this opportunity to write a couple of words to you:
the letters for B.Â NÂ âch just received should be passed on to him as soon
as possible. If he is not there, please forward them to him.  

If Berg is there, ask him to write me a few words about his plans: when
and where he is going, and for how many days. And the main thing: did he
receive the two letters I posted to him on Saturday morning (theÂ 12th)?


We are busy getting settledâthere is plenty to do. In the meantime
write to Alexeyevâs addressâI shall get it at once
(Mr.Â Alexejeff. 14.Â Frederick Str. 14.Â Grayâs Inn Road. London W.Â C.). You
got my letter from Cologne, didnât
 you?[1]


And what about your article?  

Best regards,

 Yours....  

(First impression of London: vile.  And everything is quite expensive!)

23.IV.Â 02 

Dear P.Â B., 

Hereâs my new address (which I would earnestly request you not to give
to anyone, not even League members, with

  Â  

the exception of those who stand closest to us, such as L.Â Gr. or B.Â N.;
let the others write to the Alexeyev address as before, and outsiders to
the Dietz address. If possible, when talking with people try systematically
to speak of Munich instead of London and the people in Munich in stead of
Londoners).

Mr. Jacob Richter (Holford)
30. Holford Square. Pentonville. London W. C.


Berg has probably already left; I got a letter from him today saying
that he was leaving on Thursday. If he is still there, tell him that if he
does not find Alexeyev at home he can go to Richterâitâs only two steps
away.  

If the âformer Economistâ (the lady you liked so much) is there, ask
her, or, rather, interrogate her closely, whether she mailed the
registered letters she was given to send off on AprilÂ 11, 1902, in
Munich. If she did, let her send us the receipts at once. If not, give her
a good calling down and ask her where the letters areâbetter still, let
her write us (at the Alexeyev address).  

I am sending today by book-post (not registered) some thing very
interesting for L.Â Gr.; let him give it his closest attention.  

Has G.Â V. written the editorial he promised for Iskra No.Â 20?
If so, has it been sent to the printers? Have you sent anything else to the
printers?  If not, what are we going to do about an editorial? Is
it possible that you all have left the question open? Berg writes nothing
about this!?!?  

Best regards,

 Yours....

4.V.Â 02 

Dear Comrade, 

We have good reason to fear that our delegate (to the conference) was
arrested soon after the conference, before he had time to hand over his
office.[1] We therefore ask you to let us know:
1) who besides our delegate was elected to the preparatory (or organising,
etc.) committee? and
2) how can we contact these people (address, key, password, etc.)?  

You might write your communication in invisible ink in code, if
necessary, giving the key to the bearer of this letter personally. In
general it is most convenient to maintain contact through the bearer, who
can send a wire in emergencies and, if something particularly urgent and
pressing happens, take a decision himself.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The delegate arrested was F.Â I. Dan, who represented the Editorial
Board of Iskra at the Belostok conference of R.S.D.L.P. committees
and organisations held March 23â28 (April 5â10), 1902.

4.V.Â 02 

Owing to completely unexpected and unforeseen circumstances, we
received your letter only yesterday and there fore could not reply
earlier. We have heard nothing from our delegate about the âagreed
placeâ. It would therefore be more expedient for you to take steps
directly to deliver the leaflet to the
committees.[1] Evidently one of our people has been taken. So far we are
not printing anything about the Belostok arrest. To speed up things in
important matters we would earnestly ask you to pass on all
information

  Â  

through the comrade in Paris (Leiteisen), sending us (to the address: Herrn
Philipp RÃ¶gner. Cigarrenhandlung. Neue Gasse. 44.Â NÃ¼rnberg) either a
copy of the statements handed to the Paris comrade, or a brief summary.


For the Editors of Iskra,

Dear L.Â I., 

I greatly regret that I just cannot comply with your request and come
to Berne. My health is very bad, and I really do not know whether I shall
be able to deliver the lecture in Paris properly; did not manage to prepare
it, almost complete
ArbeitsunfÃ¤higkeit,[1]

nerves no good at all. If I could, I would get out of going to Paris too,
but it would be a shame to let them
down.[2] If I donât disgrace myself in Paris and if I rest a little
afterwards, I shall do

  Â  

my best to come over without fail (perhaps in the autumn), but now I simply
cannot do it.  

With best regards and many thanks for letting us hear from you.  

Yours,
 Lenin 

P.S. My wife would like to know whether the letter for L.Â Gr., and also
her letter concerning the money (with the request that the money be
returned or transferred to Richter), have been received.

12.VII.Â 02 

Dear G.Â V., 

Your article
      received.[1]

Many thanks for revising it. I have sent it to London just now. As regards
Bergâs article, V.Â I. believes it could very well go next to yours, but in
my opinion it would-be better to hold it up until later. We shall ask Berg.


Write to me in London, for I donât know how long I shall be
here. Still, Iâll be staying here at least a week, and in case you write
within this time, hereâs the address:


M-me Leguen (pour M.Â Olinoff)
Loguivy (par Ploubazlanec).
CÃ´tes du Nord.
France.

Why didnât your trip to Brussels come
off?[2] Is the conference not going to take place? At any rate I hope to
see you in London. I donât think much of L.Â Gr.âs plan to

  Â  

substitute for the London meeting a trip by Berg and myself to Switzerland
for 10â12 days (sic!) to see some new arrivals from Russia. Really, how
can anything worth while be accomplished in 10â12 days? For we have to get
to know the arrivals thoroughly and individually, and besides we have much
to talk over among ourselves. And we cannot afford to stay long in
Switzerland (thereâs work to be done). Lastly, the newcomers must (if they
are Iskra supporters) make a study of all (or part) of our
correspondence with Russia, and this can be done only in London. Without
such a study of our correspondence the meeting would be point less and all
but useless. Because of all these reasons I am strongly for a meeting in
London.  

Best regards,

 Yours....  

P.S. In my opinion, unity with the Union crowd is out of the question
now: they are insolent and were very offensive towards Berg in
Paris.[3] Perhaps he will forward to you my letter setting forth in
detail why it is necessary to be firm and extremely cautious with them. Our
affairs in Russia are now very much on the upgrade, and here are the Union
people threatening to display independence! God forbid....  

Somehow Zarya is still stuck. Dietz jokes that it isnât fated
to come out!  
 

Notes
 

[1]
The reference is to the article âCriticism of Our Criticsâ, published
later in Zarya No.Â 4.âEd.  
 



[2]
Probably a reference to G.Â V. Plekhanovâs trip to attend a meeting of
the International Socialist Bureau.





[3]

Y.Â 0. Martov (Berg) conducted talks in Paris with members of the Union
of Russian Social-Democrats concerning the formation abroad of a section of
the Organising Committee to prepare for the convocation of a Party
congress, as envisaged in the decision of the Belostok conference.

Your communication concerning the âinheritanceâ
received.[3] We too feel there is much that is âstrange and
incomprehensibleâ about this, especially the suggestion that

  Â  

Fyokla[1]

should look for a lawyer. How could Fyokla do it? And why shouldnât the
heir himself do it? Of course, nothing ventured, nothing gained, and an
attempt might be made, but it has to be nevertheless thoroughly
considered. Otherwise we might make a laughing-stock of ourselves by
chasing soap-bubbles. So, do everything possible to investigate the matter
and let us know how âthe heir can be placed at our disposalâ. Send him
abroad, or what? Describe him in detail for us. Further, why
didnât âyourâ heir apply to the lawyers acting for the co-heirs?
(Needless to say, we cannot afford to spend any money on this.)  

It would be very important for us to have good contact
directly with the Southern workersâ
organisation.[4] Please attend to this and send us as detailed an
account of it as
      possible.[2]

A reference to the inheritance left by a Russian who had died

one-third of the property involved. The Editorial Board turned down the
proposition.

A reference to the Social-Democratic organisation in the Crimea, which
V.Â G. Shklyarevich put in touch with the Editorial Board of

organisation.

4/VIII.  

1) I received two more letters from you but could not
make them out. Your invisible ink is not concentrated enough. Try it out
each time before writing. It is terribly annoying to get a letter and not
be able to read it.  

2) Did you get our letter asking you to send us some
300Â rubles out of our money?  

3) What have you heard from prison?  

4) Illgâs address. You have it wrong, it should
be:[2]


5) Let us know whatâs doing in the committee. It is said
that a certain âLeontyâ

   (Potyomkin)[3]

has arrived in Berlin. He is supposed to have told a Berlin comrade of ours
that
a) the Kiev Committee is stripping the âStarikiâs supportersâ of all
authority,
b) that it is indignant about the Iskra letter and will oppose the
recognition of Iskra as the Party organ,
c) that the committee had instructed him to contact Zhizn, which
the Kiev people want to make the Party

  Â  

organ,
d) that the committee is powerless to counteract the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, does not venture to come out against terrorism
and merely seeks to oppose the circulation of literature such as The
Ways People Live and the like. There is probably something wrong here
and we have asked word to be passed on to Leonty that be should write us
and give us a detailed account of what is happening. But he has not
written. Let us know how things stand.  

We earnestly beg you to contact us directly on all matters of
any importance, for passing on information through Berlin, etc.,
always confuses things terribly. We believe that in this case too there has
been some mix-up. When giving assignments to people going abroad they must
be told not to confine themselves to seeing one or another League member
but to contact the Editorial Board without fail either in person
or by writing themselves (i.e., not leaving it to some League
member to do)âregistered letters from abroad to the Dietz and other
addresses are quite safe. This is necessary because the members of
the League and even members of its administration are scattered all over
Europe and do not know much about contacts with
       Russia.[4]


We still havenât got the address for contacting you. It
was probably in one of the letters we could not make out, but thereâs
nothing we can do about it. We are waiting for your reply.  

Please put us in touch with Vakar.

6) We are very much afraid for Arkady, let him take care
of him self and not stint money, better not send any to Fyokla.  

About PointÂ 6. Since they are on his trail, Arkady should leave
St.Â Petersburg without fail. He could leave now,

  Â  

since we shall be seeing
Kolya[2] here. Let Arkady bear in mind that he is now practically the
only one we have, and that he must take care to avoid arrest at all
     costs .[1]

8.VIII.Â 02 

Dear G.Â V., 

The
       comrade[1]

we had been waiting for, and whom the old
friend[2] who brought you the money knows, arrived here yesterday. First
of all please tell this old friend to come here: he will be needed for
joint talks, and the newly-arrived comrade will be here no more than a week
and a half or two.  

Further, about the new arrival seeing you. He himself wants to meet
youâand it would of course be very useful to the cause if he did. The
only question is whether you should try to come here earlier so as to be
sure to find him, or, on the contrary, whether you should wait for him in
Geneva, where he is going from here. Yesterday, before he knew
that you too would be here soon, he asked me for a letter to you.  

Take this too into consideration: practically all the Rabocheye
Dyelo people (Martynov, Akimov, Olkhin, Krichevsky, who is going
there, and others) have gathered in Switzerland (in Montreux, if
Iâm not mistaken) and our visitor is going there to see them. The
first impression is that he is an Iskra supporter, and Russian
friends recommend him as one. ButÂ ... just the same.... Mightnât the Union
crowd (the Rabocheye Dyelo people) feed him a pack of lies? How
will it be if he sees them last and is unable perhaps to stand

  Â  

up to some new gossip, or the like? Therefore we think it might be better
if he made your acquaintance and saw you more than once in Geneva. You
could then perhaps talk things over with him both during his meetings with
the Union people and after. Then perhaps whatever new gossip there may be
could be squashed at once, etc.  

Talk this over (with our old friend), decide where to meet the
new arrival, and let us have an answer as soon as possible. The worst thing
that could happen would be for you to miss each other.  

If you decide to see him over there (but our old friend should come
here under all circumstances), we shall write you a detailed letter giving
all the information we have about him.  

Is your mail address absolutely safe? Are you certain your letters
will not be read? 

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

12.VIII.Â 02 

Just received your letter of JulyÂ 25 and read it together with
Grazhdanin. We are surprised that you, as a member of the Organising
Commission,[2] are not carrying out the earlier intention to co-opt new
members from among workers outside
Manya.[1]

Grazhdanin believes this measure is the only way to reorganise Manya from
top to bottom, and it should be done as soon as possible.  

You must see to it that nothing happens to Arkady:
we hold you responsible for him, and shall take action against you if you
do not get him out of Petersburg before

  Â  

he is arrested. Let him not be carried away by live work and forget that
the gendarmes are also alive. We badly need someone in the South (in
Kharkov or Kiev!). Couldnât Arkady be sent there?

Dear Leiteisen, 

Y.[1]

passed on to me your resolution for the conference on the formulation. I
was quite satisfied with the âConfidential Communicationâ, but the
verdict should in my opinion be more emphatic, more categorical. In
particular, I would suggest: 

Run par.Â 3 into par.Â 4, since in itself par.Â 3 is unfinished and
pointless.  

Add to par.Â 1: âA thorough examination of all the data relating to
Gurovichâs character has convinced the commission that as regards his moral
qualities he has nothing in common with a sincere and honest
revolutionary.â  

To par.Â 2. âConsequently, Gurovich did not tell the truth or had to
conceal much about his means of livelihood.â  

Par.Â 3. See above (and par.Â 4).  

Par.Â 5. The commission finds that even if in any one of these instances
it could be assumed that the gendarmes learned the facts in some other,
chance, and unknown manner, a comparison of all these instances absolutely
rules out such an assumption and allows of no doubt as to Gurovichâs
treachery.  

Par.Â 6 should precede par.Â 5.  

Par.Â 7. Insert âunanimously and insistentlyâ. Add: âThe commission
finds that this opinion is fully borne out by many of the particulars
communicated to it which cannot be made public for reasons of
secrecy. However, the commission

  Â  

is informing the revolutionary organisations of some of these
facts in a confidential circular letter.â  

âTaking into accountâ should be shifted from the introduction to the
conclusion, for many of the points are not connected and, taken separately,
not too weighty.  

Taking into account the aforegoing, the commission holds that the
accused Gurovichâs plea that there is no absolutely definite evidence and
unquestionable proof in no way can serve to exonerate him. A crime such as
secret service in the political police, generally speaking, with the
exception of a few isolated cases, cannot be proved by absolutely definite
evidence and facts concrete enough to be verified by outsiders. Having
examined all the evidence in its entirety and thoroughly verified numerous
depositions by revolutionaries, the commission has arrived at the firm
conviction that (in detail) Mikhail Ivanovich Gurovich
      (calling,[2]

etc., in detail) was an agent of the secret political police and
operated in St.Â Petersburg revolutionary organisations as a
provocateur.  

The commission therefore urges all honest Russian citizens strictly to
boycott Gurovich and to treat him consistently as a traitor and spy.  

Those are my comments, dearÂ L. Please bear in mind that I did not have
time to give much thought to the formulation (for Y. wants the manuscript
back at once) and that I have only given a rough idea of the lines along
which I think it should be amended. It should make as formidable an
impression as
      possible[3]

;

I would then be in favour of publishing the sentence as a separate leaflet,
with a photograph and an introduction from Iskra on the need to
wage a systematic struggle against provocateurs and spies, to set up groups
to expose, shadow and harass them, and so on.  

If the
    âfighterâ[4]

tries to wriggle out of it, try to get him to enter his dissenting opinion,
or something of the

  Â  

sort, in the minutes, so that a record should remain of his
shilly-shallying.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Tuesday, Geneva 

Dear L.Â I., 

As regards my lecture, I think that it should be arranged for
Saturday. Yesterday I spoke in Lausanne, today here, and the
discussion here is planned for the day after
tomorrow.[1] Please try to do everything you can to make
arrangements for no later than Saturday; I first thought of having
the talk on Friday, but they say Saturday is better. It is most important
for me to have it over and done with as soon as possible, and if there is
to be discussion I think it should be on Sunday, no later. I still have to
go to Zurich to speak there.  

I am thinking of leaving at 12.45 on Friday which would get me to you
afterÂ 4. I shall come from the station to your place. Please reply at once
whether the lecture has really been arranged for Saturday.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Frey

Dear L.Â I., 

Thanks for your letter and for the money which was received today.


I received Krasnoye
Znamya[1] but havenât read it yet.  

I was quite tired after the trip, but now Iâm beginning âto come toâ,
although I still have to repeat the lecture here tomorrow.  

Boring! I do not know yet whether I shall write the pamphlet against
the S.R.s.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

16/XII.  

Your letter of NovemberÂ 15 received.  

I. It was written in a code unknown to us, but we
deciphered it all with the exception of the addresses. (Code only by
complete sentences, otherwise the key is very easy to discover.) Repeat the
addresses....  

III. The committee should he joined without fail and
agitation conducted within it to persuade it to affiliate with the
all-Russia organisation. At the same time the Southern League should be
influenced in the same direction. The existence of two organisations in the
same city is not
normal,[3] and they should eventually merge and form an Iskra
committee; how to do it is, of course, up to you.  

(It goes without saying that the merger should take place only if our
victory is assured. Otherwise it is better to wait,

  Â  

preserving the organisation which supports Iskra and undermining
the other from
       within.[2]

)




IV. Re the Organising Committee.  

V. We have been informed that some consignment of
Iskra was intercepted in Odessa. What happened?

At the end of 1902 there were two organisations in Odessaâa
Social-Democratic committee of an anti-Iskra trend and the

 Â  

Southern Revolutionary League of Social-Democrats, founded in September
1902. In December 1902 the Southern League ceased to exist as an
independent organisation. As a result of persistent work on the part of the
Iskra supporters in Odessa (Rozalia Zemlyachka, K.Â 0. Levitsky and
others) to combat the Economists and the Borba group, it merged
with the Iskra organisation in April 1903. Lenin examines the
question in a letter to Lyubov Axelrod dated DecemberÂ 18, 1902 (see this
volume, DocumentÂ 59).

18.XII.Â 02 

Dear L.Â I., 

Just received your letter and am hastening to reply in order to
congratulate you on such a tremendous acquisition as Stavsky. His name was
mentioned in letters we received from Rostov-on-Don, but I deleted it, for
fear of compromising
him.[1]

I am enclosing Iskra No.Â 29 for you and for him, to let him see
without delay our account of the events. I also enclose a letter to him
with a request concerning a pamphlet on the Rostov developments.  

Further, as regards âMisha the Compositorâ. The pseudonym is unknown
to me, but I know and worked with Vas. Andr. Shelgunov whom he
mentions. Since Shelgunov spoke to him about me, please convey to him
greetings from me personally and ask him to write us in detail about every
thing, i.e., about the work and about himself, who he is and what
his plans are at present, how long he will be abroad, and so on. You will
have to devote some attention to these people: it is very important to win
them over completely. If you havenât the time to spare, send them to our
people in Zurich or Geneva. We may soon be able to send a young

  Â  

and very energetic and capable comrade from here (pseudonym: âPeroâ) to
help you.  

By the way, âMishaâ is mistaken about Odessa: we have letters from
the âscene of actionâ there. There are the S.R.L. (Southern Revolutionary
League of Social-Democrats) and the Committee. The latter supports
Borba and opposes Iskra. The former is closer to
Iskra, but not yet altogether âoursâ.
The Odessa Committee has put out No.Â 3 of Rabocheye Slovo
(a printed paper). The S.R.L. issues leaflets. To which âgroupâ did
âMishaâ belong? The S.R.L., the Odessa Committee, or some other?  

My wife will attend to the Petersburg and Moscow messages, that is, she
will write to the proper people.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

19.XII.Â 02 

Dear G.Â V., 

I received your letter and hasten to reply. So you are writing the
pamphlet. I am very glad to hear it. It would be a very good thing to
publish in the feuilleton of Iskra some of the chapters from the
pamphlet, including the one you mention. I expect it next week;
otherwise it wonât get into No.Â 30. It would be desirable to get it in so
as to keep on attacking the S.R.s without let-up.  

Arenât you really going to reply to Tarasov (reprint from No.Â 3)?
Please do not give up the idea. He needs a good lesson.  

Drop me a couple of lines to let me know whether you are writing
something, and if so, what and when do you expect to finish, so that I may
know what should go into the issue.  
 

I cannot tell whether it is necessary to go to Brussels, for I have no
idea of what will be discussed at the
conference.[2] We have money now (America has sent 5,000Â frs.), which
means that if necessary it is possible to go. Ginsburg, in my opinion,
could take your place only as an exception, for this
once, but under no circumstances permanently, for it is very likely
that decisive steps will have to be taken there too.  

If you decide to go, write or wire about the money.  

Levinson is threatening to leave because Lalayants was made manager of
the printery and he has quarreled with him. I wrote Lalayants asking him to
âsmoothâ things out. Perhaps you too could help to calm down Levinson and
impress it on Lalayants to handle him âwith careâ.  

I am sending to the printers (to Lalayants) the beginning of the
translation of Kautsky and a popular pamphlet on army life. Please look
through it at least in proofs.  

In Petersburg our workers have been arrested, and our
intellectuals too. And so the Economists have managed to incite part of the
workers.

Nadezhdinâs glee. He should be taken to task for his demagogy. The
scoundrel!  

Lepeshinsky is In the fortress; he was transferred there until âready
to submit to interrogationâ. The threat of a High Court trial (which means
hard labour) hangs over him.  They took from him a letter concerning the
Organising
Committee.[3] 

Stavsky, the worker-orator from Rostov, is now in Berne. L.Â I. has
contacted him: he is an Iskra supporter. He should be drawn closer
to us.  

The Tomsk people have reprinted our draft programme with an
introduction which is a hymn of praise to Iskra-Zarya and all its
work.  

We shall soon have more information on the progress made by the
Organising Committee.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

Things are schwach with transport, altogether schwach! A real
calamity!!

25.XII.Â 02 

Dear G.Â V., 

Just received a letter from you and A.Â N. (how it came to be delivered
on a holiday I donât understand!). Well, this looks like forced moves, as
chessplayers say. Under the circumstances Bonch of course should be won
over to our side, and in all likelihood, everybody will approve of your
step (going to Bonch-Bruyevich and âinvitingâ him to join the League).


But the question is what to do next. In my opinion, if your talks with
Bonch-Bruyevich will be (or were) successful, it is necessary first of all
(having assured him that you will sponsor his candidacy in the League and
are quite certain of success) to insist on a formal step on his
part as well. In other words, he should officially and publicly announce
that there has been a split in Zhizn and that he
wishes to go over to Iskra.  

Without such a step, I think, his candidacy should not be
formally put forward in the League, since Bonch-Bruyevich
officially has not yet left Zhizn and it would be ridiculous to
accept a person belonging to another organisation. Moreover, if
Bonch-Bruyevich is still only warring with Posse, still only
âdividing upâ things with him, defending our interests, there is
as yet no guarantee of a favourable outcome!! This should not be
forgotten. And if âBonch is most determined to come over to usâ, as
A.Â N. writes, insistence on your part will in no way be objectionable to
him, he will admit himself that so long as he has not officially left
Zhizn and made a statement, we, the League, cannot vote
for him. If the split in Zhizn has been finally decided

  Â  

on and is absolutely inevitable, it is in Bonchâs own interests
and his duty to announce this publicly at the earliest date, if
only in a
letter[1]

to Iskra. We would publish the letter at once in No.Â 30 and
thereby forestall our opponents and âbind Bonchâ (and ourselves by
printing the
       letter[2]

).

In deed, this would be the best way, and the safest, for other wise we
might get into trouble....  

And so my opinion is this: I also consider âall kinds of overturesâ
to Bonch (which A.Â N. writes about and which you are making) necessary, but
if he, Bonch, does not take the formal step, and until he takes it, we
should confine our selves to these overtures which do not officially commit
the League, and nothing more.  

As to what will happen later, no more hitches can be expected. When
Bonch-Bruyevich has left Zhizn and made a public statement, and
when his transport group has given its support to this statement, it can
easily obtain printed matter from our administration and begin transporting
it. If it becomes necessary to admit this group as well (as you, G.Â V.,
assume), we shall then find out all about it from Bonch and discuss whom to
accept and how.  


[[BOX-ENDS:

You, G.Â V., write that âwe are awaiting instructions for the negotiations
with the transport groupâ. Let the group first set forth its position
in detail, for who can tell what it represents?]]  

You have not yet replied, G.Â V., about your feuilleton for
Iskra, or the article about Tarasov. Why?  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. Please send or pass on this letter to A.Â N.

I am sending you No.Â 29 and âUrgent
       Issueâ.[1]

The two other pamphlets have not yet been found; the âlibraryâ
here is a sorry spectacle and being in the commune has been
affected by the disorder of the
den.[3] 

I wrote to G.Â V. yesterday about Zhizn and asked him to pass
the letter on to
you.[2]


You ought to meet Sanin (through G.Â V. or Lalayants). He is something
of a misanthrope, and has fallen behind in every respect, but I believe he
could write. It would be very useful to influence him, get him interested,
and draw him into the work. Now he is translating Kautsky (Die soziale
Revolution) for us.  

Best regards....  

I am also sending a manuscript, âA Page from the Life of a
Young Revolutionaryâ. Please send it back yourself (only
show it to G.Â V., to make sure it will not be lost) and let us know your
opinion and vote.

The main task now is to strengthen the O.Â C., to give battle, on the
basis of recognition of this O.Â C., to all who are opposed, and then
prepare for convening the congress as soon as possible. Please do
everything you can to ensure that everybody understands this task correctly
and that it

The Iskra organisation in Russia united all followers of
Iskra in the country. When the Organising Committee for convening
the Partyâs Second Congress was established at the Pskov conference, the
Iskra organisations placed all their contacts at its disposal. The
Iskra organisation in Russia existed up to the Second Congress and
played an important part in preparing for and convening this Congress which
founded the revolutionary Marxist party in Russia.

1.I.Â 03 

Dear Comrade, 

Your letter of DecemberÂ 21st and all 19Â manuscripts
received.[1] I am thinking of giving some of these letters (in
particular about sectarians) in early issues of Iskra, perhaps
even in No.Â 31, which will come out in a couple of weeks.  

The one thing not quite clear to me is whether to indicate that these
are âfrom the materials of Zhiznâ. On the one hand, it would be
the most natural thing to do, thatâs how itâs usually done, and nobody in
Russia would be puzzledâespecially if we also carried an item (or your
letter to the editor) about Zhizn ceasing publication.  

On the other hand, it appears from your letter that the Zhizn
organisation did not want to pass the materials on to Iskra and
that you have done so on your own initiative. If that is so, do you wish
the materials printed without any comment or indication of the
source?  

Kindly let me know how things stand and also your opinion on how best
to present the material. Please reply to the following address, which I
would ask you not to give to anyone else so that it should be used by you
only: Mr.Â Jacob Richter.  

30.Â Holford Square 30.Â Pentonville. London W.Â C.  

Wishing you all the best,

 Lenin

1/I.Â 03 

We do not have the rest of the pamphlets (of those you asked for),
could not find them.  

Return the âYoung Revolutionaryâ manuscript after showing it to
Plekhanov (or even without showing it to him).  

Could you write a paragraph, article or feuilleton for Iskra
on the 25thÂ anniversary of the death of Nekrasov? It would be a good thing
to print something. Write whether you will do it.  

As regards Bonch, the letter and the 19Â manuscripts from Zhizn
he has sent here largely meet my wishes. It was just this kind of formal
move and by no means a ârenunciationâ (ârenunciationâ of what??) that I
suggested we should strive for without considering it a conditio
sine qua.  

(But Posseâs intriguing should have been brought out into the open, and
it was precisely against Posse and not against Bonch that I advised
persuading Bonch to take a direct step while provoking Posse to do
likewise.)  

Best regards....  

I have no faith in the transport channels of Zhizn. We
need money badly, of course, and if it were
possible to get a large sum, many concessions (not to speak of
promises) could be made for the sake of this. But precisely âfor
the sake of thisâ and âfor itâ..

Dear G.Â V., 

Please pass on the enclosed letter to Lyubov Isakovna; she gave me your
address. The letter is very urgent and

  Â  

important, and if she is not there, send it on at once, but read
it first yourself. The point is that there has been a delay with materials
about the Rostov strike, and we must hurry with the pamphlet. If the people
from Rostov are in Geneva, please help to hurry them up.  

The feuilleton for No.Â 31 has been set up in type and the proofs sent
to you. If you have important corrections, send them in
immediately.  

How is the pamphlet coming
along?[1]

How long will it be approximately and when do you expect to finish it? We
should have at least a rough idea so as to know what to do about the
printing.  

And what about the continuation of the article âThe Proletariat and
the Peasantryâ? Will you finish it with one more feuilleton? Can you send
it in for No.Â 32? (If not, we shall probably have to print âThe Problems
of the Dayâ sent by Julius, also against the Socialist-Revolutionaries,
specifically concerning the editorial in Revolutsionnaya Rossiya
No.Â 14, and likewise scheduled for several issues. Because of this it would
be very much in place to finish your article first.) Reply as soon as
you can.  

How was your lecture on the seventh? How are things with
Zhizn?  Bonch-Bruyevich sent me the materialsâsome of them were
chosen for No.Â 31. He also wrote about transport: in this respect, just as
I thought, they have practically no thing. As regards the money
and the printing shop, we ought to try to get from them some concrete
tokens of their abstract goodwill towards us. Incidentally, did you write
L.Â Gâch (he is in Paris now) about the vote for the Benches in the
League?  

Best regards,

 Yours....  

P.S. I should like to have your advice about my lectures (on the
agrarian question) in the higher school in Paris. They have invited me and
I have given my consent, butÂ ... the crowd there (Chernov, Filippov,
Tugan). On the other hand, âoursâ write me from Paris: the âcrowdâ is
not your concern,

  Â  

and that as a counterweight it is extremely important to speak there
too. What do you think?

15.I.Â 03 

Dear L.Â I., 

Received the material from the Rostov comrades (or rather it is still
only a semblance of material!) and a letter from three of them. Too late
for No.Â 31. And if you want my opinion, it ought not to be published: there
is something not quite right about three men who have fled abroad
proclaiming their
solidarity![1] 

Why shouldnât they write to Rostov-on-Don instead, so that the Don
Committee (which knows them after all and

  Â  

trusts them of course) should
1) send in a statement of solidarity and
2) officially ask us to publish a pamphlet on Rostov? Wouldnât it
be better to wait a while for a statement of that kind than to
print a private letter?  

Or perhaps the addresses in Rostov donât function? If they do not, let
them give detailed instructions and we shall try to send someone to restore
contact.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The three Rostov comrades were I.Â I. Stavsky, Mochalov and
Z.Â Mikhailov. Iskra No.Â 35 of MarchÂ 1, 1903, carried a letter from
the Don Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. announcing its solidarity with
Iskra and Zarya on all questions relating to programme,
tactics and organisation.

O.Â C. announcement must be preserved without fail (as a very important
document) and you will have to decide about Peroâs article in view of the
abundance of articles against the S.R.s. The Rostov people are writing a
protest. Thatâs one thing. Pero is No.Â 2. A.Â N. has already written, most
likely (he wrote that he was finishing it), about the
S.R.s.[4] Thatâs three. Your editorial âPseudo Friends of the
Proletariatâ is four. This has to be discussed to avoid des Guten
       zuviel.[1]

It had better be discussed by you since the Rostov comrades are close at
hand, and so is A.Â N. with whom you can talk things over. In my opinion the
editorial (an annihilating one) in any case should be written by
you and no one else because you have debated this in public and have seen
the Rostov comrades. The Rostov protest should also be published in No.Â 33,
but it

  Â  

should be as brief and
       sachlich[2]

as possible. Peroâs article (it isnât long) should also go in, I think, for
it is a sensible reply to a foolish move. A.Â N.âs article could perhaps be
held over, for it is not a reply nor does it deal with a topical issue but
is about moderate fathers and S.Â R. sons âin generalâ.  

Think all this over and let us know your decision as soon as possible.


The article about Nekrasov will go into No.Â 33.  

Already several days ago I received the Armenian
Proletariat[5] (with Russ. S.D.L.P. on the masthead)
as well as a piece of copy (an item about it); I shall try to get it into
No.Â 33.  

I am sending you Proletariat as well. Please ask Lalayants or
somebody else to translate in full everything in it about
nationalism and federalism and send it to me as soon as
possible. An item on this should be published without fail (the piece
sent in needs editing and for this we must have the text).  

What do you think of Bonch!? Our ânet gainâ was just the two of
themânot very much! There is the liquidator (see Zhizn No.Â 6)
Mr.Â Kuklin. Make his acquaintance through Bonch. Couldnât we squeeze
something out of him? I believe you met him before, didnât you? At least
for the Russian congress, for the O.Â C. (one of its members is abroad and
he could be sent to see Kuklin if need be)? After all, Kuklin canât eat up
the printing office, can he? We should levy a contribution of 10,000 on him
for our not having come down on Zhizn (it is not for nothing that
I defended it by pleading its light mindedness!) or for not doing so in the
future....  

Yours,
 Lenin 

P.S. Have you seen Rudinâs pamphlet (S.Â R., âOn the Peasant
Questionâ)? The shameless scoundrels! My fingers are itching
terribly to get at Rudin and at No.Â 15 on socialisation!
Please let me know whether you are writing your pamphlet, how big
it will be, and when you expect to finish it. Iskra should not be
filled with that material; a pamphlet

  Â  

examining all aspects would be far better, and now that the
transport channels are working we could knock them out with
a businesslike and principled examination of the sub stance of the
matter. Should I write a criticism of Rudin? What do you think? The idea
occurred to me to write an article criticising
Rudin[6] and to publish separately âarticles against the S.R.sâ
together with âRevolutionary Adventurismâ.  

What do you think of this?

5/II.Â 03 

Dear G.Â V., 

I received your article and letter. In what issue the article will be
printed I cannot tell as yet. I will let you know in a few daysâthough it
also depends on your reply about the article on Nekrasov.  

To speed up the answer to the Union, I have done the following. V.Â I.,
L.Â Gr. and I agreed upon a draft reply and sent It to Julius (it is
important to discuss it there also with P.Â And.). Julius is to send you the
reply at once together with my letter.  

If you approve of the reply, pass it on to Olkhin (and arrange for him
to keep in touch either through you or else give him the Richter
address. Better through you).  

If you do not agree with the answer, put precisely formulated
amendments (or a new text) to the vote at once, and tell Olkhin that things
are being held up somewhat because of the voting in a âscatteredâ board.


I am very glad that you are writing an editorial on the
âPseudo-Friends of the Proletariatâ and in the introduction to Thun are
giving a trouncing to Tarasov (page from the history of socialist
thought). The introduction to Thun is of course the proper place for this.

 

The breakdown of Iskraâs Austrian channel is nonsense. So far
everything has been going well there with three channels
functioning. Dementyev is doing a fine job and writes regularly.  

(It would be a good thing if you would summon also A.Â N. to cast his
vote on the letter to the Union, on the tactics of the 0.Â C. generally, and
on the election of members from us to the 0.Â C. Section
Abroad.[1]) 

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. So I can expect the editorial in a few days? Nâest ce pas?  

P.P.S. Write what you agreed upon with Olkhin. Were any
steps toward unity proposed and what exactly? Was there any talk of
Borba, Svoboda, Krasnoye Znamya?  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Organising Committee Section Abroad comprised
L.Â G. Deutsch from the Editorial Board of Iskra, A.Â I. Kremer from
the Bund, and N.Â N. Lokhov (Olkhin) from the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats Abroad.

8.II.Â 03 

Dear Comrade, 

All the material received. Thanks. About the fiction, I donât know yet
whether it will go in. I am thinking of running the item about the
sectarians in the army in No.Â 33. About the strike in Galicia I canât say
anything yet: far too long.  

As regards the collection of money (for popular literature) the person
to apply to (as on all administrative questions) is Mr.Â Leo Alleman
26.Â Granville Square 26.Â Kings Cross Road. London W.Â C. I saw him the other
day and he seemed to agree with me that new subscription lists would be
superfluous. The League already has subscription lists: they

  Â  

should be circulated more widely. As for the Iskra library, that
of course depends on the whole Editorial Board. Take it up with
Plekhanov. I confess I would not be in favour at present. In order to start
a âlibraryâ one must have a special person to edit it (whom we do not
have) or a special staff (which we do not have). One should have a
selection of books and pamphlets of like nature (which we do not
have). To stick Kautsky, Thun, etc., into the library would in my view be
artificial in the extreme.  

What need is there for a âlibraryâ? If there are good pamphlets we
can publish them without a library. In the mean time there are few
pamphlets, and no good translators. (I am having a hard time
redoing translations)âwhy make loud promises of a
âlibraryâ??  

If you manage to find good translators and select good
material for translation, the undertaking would be very useful and
bound to succeed.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

2.III.Â 03 

I am submitting to all members of the Editorial Board a proposal to
co-opt âPeroâ as a full member of the Board. (I believe that for
co-optation not a majority but a unanimous decision is needed.)


We are very much in need of a seventh member both be cause it
would simplify voting (six being an even number) and reinforce the Board.


âPeroâ has been writing in every issue for several months now. In
general he is working for Iskra most energetically, delivering
lectures (and with tremendous success), etc.  
 

For our department of topical articles and items he will be not only
very useful but quite indispensable.  

He is unquestionably a man of more than average ability, convinced,
energetic, and promising. And he could do a good deal in the sphere of
translation and popular literature.  

We must draw in young forces: this will encourage them and prompt them
to regard themselves as professional writers. And that we have too few of
such is clearâwitness
1) the difficulty of finding editors of translations;
2) the shortage of articles reviewing the internal situation, and
3) the shortage of popular literature. It is in the sphere of popular
literature that âPeroâ would like to try his hand.  

Possible arguments against:
1) his youth;
2) his early (perhaps) return to Russia;
3) a pen (without quotation
marks)[1]

with traces of feuilleton style, too pretentious, etc.  

Ad 1) âPeroâ is suggested not for an independent post, but for the
Board. In it he will gain experience. He undoubtedly has the âintuitionâ
of a Party man, a man of our trend; as for knowledge and experience these
can be acquired. That he is hardworking is likewise unquestionable. It is
necessary to co-opt him so as finally to draw him in and encourage him.


Ad 2) If âPeroâ is initiated in all aspects of our work he may not
leave so soon. And if he goes, organisational links with the Board and
subordination to it are not a minus but a tremendous plus.  

Ad 3) Stylistic shortcomings are not a serious defect. They will be
ironed out. At present he accepts âcorrectionsâ in silence (and not too
readily). In the Board there will be debates, things will be put to the
vote, and the âinstructionsâ will acquire a more definitive and
imperative form.  

Therefore, I propose 

I) that all six members of the Editorial Board vote on co-opting
âPeroâ as a full member; 

2) if he is accepted, to tackle the final settlement of relationships
and voting procedures in the Editorial Board, and to draft precise
rules. This is necessary for us and important for the congress.

 

P.S. I consider it extremely inconvenient and awkward
to put off the co-opting, for I can see that âPeroâ is already
quite annoyed (he has not of course openly said so) with being
left hanging âin the airâ and treated, so it seems to him, as a
âyoungsterâ.  

If we do not accept âPeroâ at once and he leaves in, say, a month for
Russia, I am certain he will take it as a sign that we simply
do not want him on the editorial staff. We might lose him, and that
would be very bad.

Dear G.Â V., 

I have been unwell again these days and that is why I did not answer
you. The Breshkovskaya item received, but too late to go in the current
issue. It will go in the next.  

Are you writing about collective liability? (I have asked that
S.-Peterburgskiye
Vedomosti[2] be sent to you.) It would be a good thing to have an
article on the subject for the next issue. The visitor has left. I do not
know whether it will be possible to settle the affair. At any rate I got
him to agree to mediation by the O.Â C.  

Best regards,

 Yours....  

P.S. You donât say anything about my

      pamphlet.[1]

Please send it to the printers as soon as possible: it is most important
not to hold it up. It can be read later in the proofs, if anyone else is
interested, not in the manuscript.

Private from Lenin.  

Dear Friend, 

I am greatly distressed by your long silence. I can under stand very
well why you have no desire to take up the pen, how difficult, if not
impossible, it is to write about all sorts of petty matters, but you
mustnât forget after all that these (often absurd) petty matters beset us
from other sources. You really must write a few lines, to give at least a
general idea of your attitude, otherwise you put us too in an awkward
position. We hear from all sides about discord in the O.Â C., about
the quarrel with Yuri, the quarrel about Liza, and so on. Of course I
listen very unwillingly to all this and shall never (as far as I am
concerned) allow any action to be taken until I hear from you or see you,
but how much pleasanter to have a line from you. For months there has been
nothing! So, I shall await news, and as for myself, let me say this:
it seems to me (I cannot be sure of course) that you have been carried away
a little in the matter of Liza (an inefficient person that Liza, rushes
about for no good reason in stead of attending to her business), that the
charges against Yuri are exaggerated, that the most, the very most
important thing is to hurry with the congress, to hurry by all
possible means.  

How is Kurz? I learned about his state of health recently and realised
I had no grounds whatever for being dissatisfied with him (please convey
this to him, if you can, but let me add that he too is to blame for his
silence). How are you getting on with Jacques and Kostya? What nonsense
Jacques preaches against the two centres! Canât you prevail upon that by no
means stupid but slow-thinking lad? Howâs Medvezhonok? What advice did you
give him? Very best regards.

29/VI.Â 03 

Dear Comrade, 

I am enclosing a copy of the Russian translation of your pamphlet
(The Social Revolution). I have made only one remark on
pages 129â30, where on the basis of Russian industrial statistics I have
shown how much Russia too could economise by organising bigger enterprises
(100 and more workers) working two or three shifts, and by closing down
small ones.  

The Russian translation of the pamphlet has been printed in 5,000
copies.[1] 

With best regards,

 Lenin

Notes
 
 



[1]
Kautskyâs pamphlet Die soziale Revolution was published in
Geneva in 1903 in the Russian translation by N.Â Karpov, edited by
Lenin. The editorsâ note on pages 129â30 reads: âTo show the reader how
great is the concentration of industry in contemporary Russia we shall give
two examples. In 1894â95 the number of factories and workshops (i.e.,
enterprises using mechanical power or employing no less than 16 workers) in
European Russia was estimated at 14,578, with 885,555 workers and output
totalling 1,345 million rubles. Of these the big factories, i.e., with 100
or more workers, numbered only 1,468, i.e., one-tenth, but they employed
656,009 workers, near y three-fourths of the total, and the value of their
output amounted to 955 million rubles, i.e., seven-tenths of the total
sum. From this one can judge how radically we could raise productivity of
labour, increase wages and reduce working hours if we expropriated all the
manufacturers, closed down the small enterprises, and left only one and a
half thousand big factories working two eight-hour shifts or three
five-hour shifts! Another example. In 1890 there were about nine and a
half thousand handicraft tanneries in European Russia

 Â  

with 21,000 workers and output totalling 12 million rubles. At the same
time 66 steam-powered tanneries with 5Â 1/2 thousand workers also produced
12 million rublesâ worth of output!â

and return the pamphlet to me without delay.  

When could she return it?

I fully concur with Comrade Martovâs wish, expressed through Comrade
Hans, to eliminate the personal aspect of our
conflict[1] by an exchange of statements, and, for my part, I submit the
following statement.  

I did not and do not question the integrity and sincerity of
Martov. Once Martov states, after acquainting himself with my project for
the election of two triumvirates and approving that project, that he
personally had always considered it essential to extend the original
editorial triumvirate, I myself do not question or allow anyone else to
question Martovâs

  Â  

sincerity. I would be very glad to learn that the accusations he levelled
against me were the result of a misunderstanding.  

NovemberÂ 29, 1903

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the âpersonal conflictâ between Lenin and
Martov at the Second Congress of the League. Martov charged that in his
report to the congress of the League Lenin had presented him as an
intriguer and a liar on the question of the method of organising the
Editorial Board of the Central Organ at the Second Congress of the Party,
and he challenged Lenin to put the matter to arbitration. Lenin lodged a
protest against this method of struggle, accepted Martovâs challenge, and
in his turn pressed for arbitration. The conflict was settled through the
mediation of G.Â M. Krzhizhanovsky during his stay abroad in the second half
of November 1903 by means of a mutual exchange of statements between Lenin
and Martov. These statements were published in Commentary on the
Minutes of the Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary
Social-Democracy Abroad, Geneva, 1904.

Sent 19.XII.Â 03 

Dear Comrade, 

The C.C. leaves it to the editors of the Central Organ to issue
instructions to Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich as regards both the text of the
statement âFrom the Editorsâ in his
paper[1] and the nature of the literary supervision to be
exercised. Both questions in our opinion are within the competence of the
C.O. and we cannot undertake to issue instructions on them to Comrade
Bonch-Bruyevich.  

The editors should have taken up the mediocrity of the articles and
Comrade Bonch-Bruyevichâs inexperience not with the C.Â C. but with Comrade
Bonch-Bruyevich himself.  

The C.Â C. will of course receive the proofs and will do its best to
advise in particularly important matters. We do not think the question of
the text of the statement is very important, but âspecial supervisionâ by
the C.Â O. over a publication like Bonch-Bruyevichâs paper would, in our
opinion, be useful.  

We shall consider the question of most convenient type.  

We have left it to Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich himself to hand in the copy
to the printers if the editors of the C.O. have no objections to this.

Dear Comrades, 

Iskra No.Â 61 carried, probably by mistake, an announcement
that not only letters but also money intended for Iskra and
Zarya should be sent to Axelrodâs address.  

The public might interpret this as meaning that a special fund was
being established to finance the publication of Iskra and
Zarya, whereas actually all funds for the purpose come
exclusively from the Central Party treasury administered
exclusively by the C.C.  

We ask you to correct this mistake as soon as possible.  

Acting Representative Abroad of the C.Â C. 

P.S. Please be sure to reply to this letter

To throw light on the
matter[1] I wish to add: 1) that the claim that Osipov âresigned at the
previous meetingâ is an obvious lie, since Glebov, who was
present at this meeting, himself signed the agreement of May
1904 referring to... members of the C.C., including Osipov.  

2) I was never officially informed of Travinskyâs resignation.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the âJuly Declarationâ of the C.C. and the violation
of the decisions of the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. by the
conciliators in the C.C.  

The âJuly Declarationâ was a resolution adopted by the
conciliators in the C.C., L.Â B. Krasin, V.Â A. Noskov and L.Â Y. Galperin, in
July 1904 without the knowledge of the two remaining members, Lenin and
Rozalia Zemlyachka, who were not given an opportunity to defend in the
C.C. the position of the Majority of the Party. In this resolution the
conciliators endorsed the Menshevik composition of the Editorial Board of
Iskra which G.Â V. Plekhanov had co-opted, and co-opted into the
C.C. three other conciliatorsâA.Â I. Lyubimov, L.Â Y. Karpov and
I.Â F. Dubrovinsky. The conciliators opposed the convocation of the

 Â  

Third Congress of the Party and dissolved the Southern Bureau of the C.C.,
which was conducting agitation for the congress. They deprived Lenin of the
right to represent the C.C. abroad and prohibited the publication of his
writings without the collegial permission of the C.C.  

Local Party committeesâin St.Â Petersburg, Moscow, Riga, Baku and
elsewhereâsupported Lenin and strongly condemned the âJuly Declarationâ
(see this volume, DocumentÂ 85).

Party printers.  

In a letter dated September 12, 1904, V.Â A. Noskov informed

Irrespective of the legitimacy of Comrade Glebovâs claims (I have
handed over all materials relating to the matter to Comrades Olin,
Bonch-Bruyevich and Lyadov), I consider it necessary to state that
under all circumstances the manager and compositors are obliged to
turn over the Ryadovoi and Galyorka
       pamphlet[1]

to the authors for the following reasons: 

1) the printing of the pamphlet is paid for in full by the authors and
hence it is their exclusive property; 

2) authorisation to set up and print it in the Party printing shop was
given by agents of the C.Â C. long before Comrade Glebov appeared on the
scene with his âreformsâ. Subsequent decisions, even if they were taken
by properly constituted meetings of the C.Â C., in no way invalidate
legitimate authorisation given by persons acting as agents of the C.C; 

3) the authors do not insist that it be indicated in the pamphlet that
it was printed in the Party printing shop.  
 

I would consider refusal to turn over the pamphlet at once to
the authors to be nothing but direct seizure of other peopleâs property.

Dear Comrade, 

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter if only in a couple of
words. I am not certain that your address is still good, but Zemlyachka has
asked to write her through you. Besides, it would be desirable to start
regular correspondence. This is extremely important. To make sure that your
letters do not accidentally get into the wrong hands, write on top
âPrivate, toÂ L.â  or âPrivate, to N.Â K.â Could you let us know the
whereabouts of Tomich (=Emmanuel =Emma)? We have lost touch with him. We
sent him several letters but do not know whether they reached him. If you
happen to know his address, please let us have it.  

The Declaration of the C.C. has evidently not been too kindly received
by the Majority
     committees.[2]

In the Caucasus it caused an outburst of indignation, in Odessa, Nikolayev
and Yekaterinoslav it met with strong disapproval, and our old comrades
have been sending in indignant resolutions from prisons.... The
âconciliatorsâ have succeeded in deceiving some people by their fables
about peace prevailing in the Party. Tula, Saratov and Astrakhan, for
instance,

  Â  

are said to have withdrawn their resolutions on the congress, but as soon
as they learn what the real state of affairs is they will of course again
insist on its convocation. Incidentally, I do not know how much truth there
is to the rumours that the above-mentioned committees have withdrawn their
resolutions. The âconciliatorsâ do not always accurately enough pass on
information, and the Editorial Board, on the pretext of preserving peace,
does not print resolutions on the congress adopted by the committees
(St.Â Petersburg, Yekaterinoslav). Besides the ten points there are several
more which are in no way secret but which the âcollegiumâ (taking
advantage of the arrest of some of its staunchest members and unlawfully
expelling one member who does not share its
views[3]

)

has decided to conceal from the members of the Party to avoid unnecessary
fuss. These include the decision to dissolve the Southern
Bureau[4] and not to publish Council minutes unfavourable to the
Minority, and the prohibition of the printing of Leninâs writings in the
Party printery without permission from an agent specially appointed by the
âcollegiumâ.... The Majority has decided not to permit the opinion of the
Party to be misrepresented or to allow itself to be silenced; it is
sponsoring the publication of Majority writings; the publishing has been
undertaken by Bonch-Bruyevich. We shall not be short of literary forces,
the only hitch may be finances. Galyorkaâs pamphlet Down with
Bonapartism! (concerning the C.C. Declaration) and a collection of
articles by Galyorka and Ryadovoi have come out, and a popular pamphlet on
socialism by Ryadovoi and many other things are ready for the press.  

Pass all this on to Zemlyachka if you know her address, and also inform
her that both of her letters have been received.  

Acknowledge receipt of this letter without delay.  

Lenin 

P.S. Is your address for contacts still valid?  

Are the Pedder and Dilon addresses good? Has Tsensky

  Â  

been to see you? Did you receive our letter? Let Zemlyachka know that her
relatives are worried about her and are sure she is ill. Acknowledge
receipt of this letter at once, and we shall send you our new address
forthwith.

The Southern Bureau of the Central Committee was set up in
February 1904 with the direct assistance of Lenin. Among its members were
V.Â V. Vorovsky and I.Â K. Lalayants. The Bureau, the permanent headquarters
of which was in Odessa, waged a consistent struggle against the Mensheviks
and the conciliators, and was in favour of the immediate convocation of the
Third Party Congress despite the wishes of the central bodiesâthe C.C.,
the Central Organ, and the Council of the Party.  

In mid-August 1904 the Bureau was dissolved by the improperly adopted
âJuly Declarationâ of the C.C., but later in the autumn the first
Bolshevik conference of R.S.D.L.P. committees held in the South
reconstituted it. Together with the Northern and Caucasian bureaus, it
formed the core of the All-Russia Bureau of Committees of the Majority
established in December 1904.

The conciliators here are engaged in liquidating the Majority. When it
informed the committees of the peace re stored in the Party, the
C.C. forgot to add that it had itself gone over to the Minority and begun
to hound the Majority. Besides the points made public in C.C. resolutions,
there are also some which are not to be publicised, not because of any
considerations of secrecy, but just to avoid temptation. The C.C. has
decided: to dissolve the Southern Bureau for agitation in favour of the
congress, to disband the forwarding office, to apologise to the
book-stitchers, not to publish the minutes of the Council
[[BOX-ENDS: for they discredit the Minority and show that before beginning
agitation for the congress the Majority (firm) proposed honest peace and
insisted on the boycott being ended on both sides while the Central Organ
replied to this proposal with ridicule]],
to institute a special censorship of writings by the Majorityâa special
censor has been named from among the conciliators to decide whether one or
another piece written by Lenin can be printed, and Lenin has been deprived
of

  Â  

all the rights of a representative abroad. More, the C.C. is arranging a
conference with the Minority, completely ignoring the Majority. The
Minority of course is rejoicing and lauding the C.C. The composition of
the C.C. has changed, two members have been arrested, two have resigned,
and one member has been expelled completely unlawfully. The C.C.,
which in April took the Majority viewpoint, now finds that the C.O. is up
to the mark. Yet, if in the beginning there were no differences of
principle, now there are plenty. To justify itself, the Minority is
smearing the old Iskra. It claims (Danâs report to the
international congress, and Trotskyâs pamphlet) that the old Iskra
was not so much a Social-Democratic as a democratic organ, that it was
concerned not with organising the working class but with organising the
intelligentsia, that Axelrod did not take part in it because it was not
really a Social-Democratic organ. Only the new Iskra has put
forward the slogan âto the massesâ, and so on and so forth. It is
difficult to recount all the nonsense they are now spouting, speculating on
the ignorance of the public, on its lack of knowledge of the history of the
movement. The C.C. is not in the least perturbed by all this and is vastly
tickled at having won the forgiveness of the C.O. by its
     declaration[2]

....

On the pretext of preserving the peace in the Party the C.O. does not print
resolutions passed by committees in favour of the congress, for example,
the Yekaterinoslav, Petersburg, Moscow, Nizhni-Novgorod and Kazan
resolutions.  

Of the 20 committees in Russia (those with a vote), 12 (the
St.Â Petersburg, Tver, Tula, Moscow, Siberian, Tiflis, Baku, Batum,
Yekaterinoslav, Nikolayev, Odessa and Nizhni2Novgorod committees) have
already declared for the congress, besides which the Riga and Kazan
committees are for it. But the new C.C. has announced that the Samara,
Orel-Bryansk and Smolensk committees are now also included among those with
a vote. These committees take a conciliatory stand and conduct negligible
work....  

In view of the aforesaid, the Majority has decided not to allow itself
to be silenced and is printing its writings independently, the publishing
having been undertaken by
  Â  



Bonch-Bruyevich.[3] The Council, which said nothing when Ryazanov and
Akimov were putting out their pamphlets, has made a fuss and is insisting
that the line âRussian Social-Democratic Labour Partyâ should not figure
on the pamphlets. Bonch-Bruyevich editions of the pamphlet Down with
Bonapartism! by Galyorka and a collection of articles by Galyorka and
Ryadovoi, Our Misunderstandings, have already come out. The
pamphlet The Fight for a Congress, containing resolutions adopted
by the committees, including the Riga resolution, will be published
shortly. The Riga people say that they want to see the Party institutions
in the hands of the Majority as the Congress decided, and will press for
this at the coming congress too, but that they find it necessary that
certain rights be guaranteed to the Minority. The Riga resolution has
already been subscribed by the Petersburg and Moscow committees.  

Thatâs how things stand.  

Bear in mind that we have already been
dissolved,[4] and therefore if you want your letters to reach the right
address, write on top: private, for Sharko. I am sending you new postal
addresses.  

We hope you will give every support to the Majority publications. It
would be a good thing if a special resolution were adopted on this
question. Send us letters and materials of all kinds.  

Your previous letter still remains undeciphered. Let us know what key
you used, for although it is old by now, it interests us nevertheless. Do
you know what is happening in Yekaterinoslav and Odessa? The Minority is
spreading a rumour that the Odessa Committee has withdrawn its resolution
on the congress. We havenât heard from the spot for a long time, but the
report does not ring true. Let us know bow things are with
Gritsko. Greetings.  

P.S. We shall send you all new publications shortly.

Dear Friends, 

We were overjoyed to receive your letter, which emanates so much spirit
that it has imbued us all with new
energy.[2] You must carry out your plan by all means. It is an excellent
plan and will have tremendous significance. It is also urgently necessary
to write to the German. We are eagerly waiting to hear from you. Your
advice as regards a publishing business has already been half-realised. The
writers we have, and a mass of ready material. In general we are all in
excellent spirits now, there are plenty of plans, Stank

  Â  

too has buckled down to work, correspondence with Russia and abroad has
livened up, and now, I hope, people will soon begin to grouping. The
Minority is now flirting with the conciliators, the Central Organ is
undertaking the publication of a popular paper, the Yuzhny Rabochy
people have been given a big bite. Particulars about the publishing
business of the Majority will be passed on to you by our common
acquaintances, to whom we shall write about this in detail. Kolâs wife
and child are well, they live in Yekaterinoslav. Repeat the names of
people whom it is desirable to enlist in literary work. Brodyaga has
arrived, the Minority is wooing him, he has not yet taken a definite
stand. Josephine is here, physically she is very poorly. The forwarding
office has been turned over to the C.C. Well, I suppose thatâs all. We
embrace you warmly, dear friends, wish you health and strength.  

Stank & Co..

Geneva, OctoberÂ 10, 1904 

Dear Comrade, 

I am sending you by book-post my article which should serve as a reply
to Comrade Rosa Luxemburgâs
       attacks.[1]

I am aware that the sympathies of the editors of Neue
Zeit[2] are with my opponents, but I believe it would be only fair
to grant me the right to correct some of the inaccuracies in Rosa
Luxemburgâs articles. My article has been translated by Comrade Lidin. You
have already printed one of his articles, hence you can judge of his
knowledge of the

  Â  

German language. I myself cannot write in German. I have made my article
very brief; I wanted it to take up less space than Rosa Luxemburgâs, and
not to be too lengthy for Neue Zeit. If nevertheless you find it
too long, I am prepared to cut it again to the desired length. At the same
time I must insist that no cuts be made without my consent.  

Kindly let me know if the Editorial Board accepts the article or not.


With Social-Democratic greetings,

 N.Â Lenin 

My address:

 3. Rue David Dufour. 3.

 Genf. GenÃ¨ve, Suisse.

14/X.  

Our very dear Friends, 

We sent you some three weeks ago a letter through
    Irina.[2]
We heartily endorse your plan. Write if you have a chance. Bonch and
Lenin have undertaken the publishing end. Down with Bonapartism!,
Our Misunderstandings and To the Party have already
appeared, and On the New Road, The Fight for a Congress
and On Socialism are coming out shortly. According to our
estimates 14Â committees, Ii of them with full voting rights, have already
declared for the congress. All the attempts of the C.O., the C.C. and the
Council to hold up the agitation for the congress have proved
fruitless. The C.C. saw that the Majority also has to be reckoned with and
is evidently ready to make concessions.

  Â  

With the Minority too they havenât been able to achieve full unity. In a
word, they have got into a mess.  

Formerly the C.O. played the committees off against the C.C. and baited
the C.C., now it is playing the periphery off against the committees and
trying to prove that the opinion of the committees is not the opinion of
the Party, and that strictly speaking there is no Party. They have done
everything they could to split the Party and now they shout that the Party
does not exist.  

The position of the C.C. has untied our hands and life now is far
easier than before. Of course there is some bad news, for example,
Brodyaga has gone with the Minority, so has Samsonov, but that canât
be helped. We shall go on working and upholding our views, and time will
tell. A new pamphlet by Trotsky came out recently, under the editorship of
Iskra, as was announced. This makes it the âCredoâ as it were of
the new Iskra. The pamphlet is a pack of brazen lies, a distortion
of the facts. And this is done under the editor ship of the C.O. The work
of the Iskra group is vilified in every way, the Economists, it is
alleged, did far more, the Iskra group displayed no initiative,
they gave no thought to the proletariat, were more concerned with the
bourgeois intelligentsia, introduced a deadly bureaucracy
everywhereâtheir work was reduced to carrying out the programme of the
famous âCredoâ. The Second Congress was, in his words, a reactionary
attempt to consolidate sectarian methods of organisation, etc. The pamphlet
is a slap in the face both for the present Editorial Board of the C.O. and
for all Party workers. Reading a pamphlet of this kind you can see clearly
that the âMinorityâ has indulged in so much lying and falsehood that it
will be incapable of producing anything viable, and one wants to fight,
here there is some thing worth fighting for.  

Kolâs wife is well, she is in Yekaterinoslav. 

Warm greetings to all of you.

 Starick & Co.

Dear Comrade, 

Two weeks ago I sent my article (reply to Rosa Luxemburg) and a letter
to you at the editorial office of Neue
      Zeit.[1]

Please let me know whether the article has been accepted or not. If it has,
I must make a few small additions (about the new Russian resolutions) and
corrections. If not, I shall be compelled to look for other ways of
acquainting the German Social-Democrats with the inaccuracies in Rosa
Luxemburgâs article.  

With Social-Democratic greetings,

28/X.  

Dear Comrade, 

Your letter received. Please send us the resolution adopt ed by the
Urals Committee. The Minority maintains that the Urals Committee came out
against the congress, and Iskra has reported that it declared for
peace in the Party, voicing support for the actions of the Central
Committee. Everybody wants peace in the Party, and what is at issue now is
how to resolve the crisis experienced by the Party,

  Â  

through the Party, i.e., by convening the congress, or through a private
deal with the Minority. The Central Committee came out in its declaration
in favour of the latter. Consequently, the Iskra statement can be
under stood only in the sense that the Urals Committee has decided against
the congress.  

Use invisible ink, and address your letters âTo Lenin, privateâ.


Your letter shows that you are completely uninformed about the state of
affairs in the Party. I shall give you a brief outline. (See also letter to
the Siberian League.) So far the following committees have declared for the
congress:
Siberian, Caucasian Union Committee (after the resolution given in the
supplement to Nos.Â 73â74), Tiflis, Baku, Mingrelia-Imeretia, Odessa,
Nikolayev, Yekaterinoslav, Petersburg, Moscow, Tver, Northern Committee
(after the C.C. declaration), Nizhni-Novgorod, Kazan, Riga, and Tula
(13Â organisations with full rights)âformerly this would have been enough,
but the Council has given the right of vote to another five committees
(Smolensk (?), Orel-Bryansk (?), Samara, Astrakhan, and one more, evidently
Kremenchug). All these are committees which we know in advance will declare
against the congress. Moreover, the Council recognises only those
committees as having come out for the congress whose resolutions it has
received (the resolutions of the Nikolayev, Northern and Nizhni-Novgorod
committees have probably gone astray). Further, confirmation of the
resolutions is required every two months, which the committees, owing to
irregular receipt of Iskra and absence of regular correspondence,
may not know. The resolutions must be signed by the members of the commit
tees so that no one might vote twice for the congress (only Council members
may vote three times against the congress:
in the Council, in the Editorial Board, and in the League). In view of the
stand taken by the Council, the C.C. and the Central Organ (to hound those
conducting agitation for the congress), the demand for signatures has a
very definite purpose. The object of all this is to hamper agitation for
the congress. But since the committees are taking a very definite stand,
the Minority has now launched an attack against them. Everything is being
done to undermine the

  Â  

prestige of the committees in the eyes of the local communities and the
workers, who are being literally incited against the committees. Special
efforts are being made to influence the periphery. How this disorganises
work is easy to imagine. The Minority is now laying siege to
Petersburg. Such is the situation in the Party. Not a very happy one,
needless to say. Send us a secret address for contacts, people often go
from here and may also go to the Urals.  

With comradely greetings,

 L. 

P.S. Ask the C.C. for Majority publications.

NovemberÂ 2 

Your letter of OctoberÂ 9 (22) received. The
undeciphered letter has been repeated. Not a word about the light-minded
Minonosets. To what address was the money sent? Lidin, Alexeyev, Afanasyeva
have left, no news from Popova. 

Now for some semi-foreign, semi-Russian
news. 

The Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin
Publishers are very slow, pamphlets are coming out in driblets. The
long-promised pamphlet The Fight for a Congress has only just come
out. The hitch there is partly due to the printery, but mainly to lack of
money.
In general the money question is most desperate, for sending people to
Russia (the demand is enormous) and transport cost a great deal. Every
effort should be made to obtain a big sum. This is now the only hitch,
everything else we have. Without a big sum we are doomed to the
intolerable,

  Â  

depressing vegetable existence we are leading here. We must get that money
if it kills us. For Russia is organising and expects decisive steps from
us!
The Riga Committee has adopted a resolution
supporting this publishing business, and so have the Odessa, Nikolayev and
Yekaterinoslav committees. Many people are asking why the Majority did not
ask permission, but they completely ignore the actual situation and forget
that Bonch-Bruyevich and Lenin acted as private individuals and not in the
name of a group, though in Russia this was not understood and a resolution
was adopted in support of the group headed by Bonch Bruyevich and Lenin,
which is absurd. The C.C. refused to transport Majority literature on the
grounds that it was not Party literature. 

There is virtually a complete split in the
Party. The Minority and the C.C. have already made a deal and they are
pursuing a common line consisting in machinations against the congress and
liquidating the committees âfrom belowâ. This is done by sending into the
militant Majority committees Minority groups which lay siege to the
committee, carry on agitation in order to undermine confidence in it among
the public, among the workers, and especially in the periphery. Then, after
the ground has been prepared with the aid of the periphery, they kick up a
row in the committee demanding its surrender. This is what is happening
now, with the benevolent participation of the C.C., in Petersburg. The
C.C. is pursuing a hypocritical policy towards the Majority committees,
assuring them that if there is no reconciliation with the Minority, which,
they say, is quite possible (thereâs hypocrisy for you!), the C.C. will
call the congress, that the C.C. is not against the congress and has not
changed its views, that it considers it possible to make a deal with the
Editorial Board of the Central Organ since they do not consider it the
organ of the Party but of a group. Although it is a Majority C.C., the fact
is that at the Congress and after it, the only consideration in the
elections to the C.C. was whether X or Y was a good practical worker; the
Congress gave the C.C. no ligne de
   conduite,[2]

and hence it can lay down its own line and is not obliged to adhere to the
Majority stand. In a word, they talk any amount of nonsense. 

In Russia there is strong resentment against
them. The Nikolayev, Odessa and Yekaterinoslav committees called a
conference and adopt ed a resolution.... The Majority participants answered
them as follows.... It is proposed to elect candidates from a few of our
own committees, then announce the formation of a Bureau of the Majority
Committees, and after that make the rounds of the rest of the committees
inviting them to join in and add one or two of their own candidates to the
list. 

Where is Boroda? Arrange for a password with
Gorky. When are you coming? 

Do everything you can to make the light-minded Minonosets move
faster. The procrastination is inexplicable and

  Â  

terribly harmful. Reply at once and in greater detail, and more definitely.
So far the Bureau nominees are Demon, Felix, Baron, Lidin, Alexeyev, Gusev,
Pavlovich.

2/XI.  

Dear Comrade, 

We have learned that our letter has reached you, the same letter was
sent to Maria Petrovnaâs address. Please ask her to acknowledge receipt. We
are impatiently awaiting your reply, do not put it off too long, it is most
important now to keep up a regular correspondence. I repeat the postal
addresses. All letters and leaflets can be sent to these addresses. In our
next letter we shall send you one more address. Iskra No.Â 75
reports that the Saratov Committee has declared for peace in the Party and
âvoiced support for the actions of the C.C.â Everybody wants peace in the
Party, the only question being whether it is permissible for the C.C. to
make a deal with the Minority on the basis of an understanding that the
C.C. will work against the congress in every way. The decisions of the
Council published in the supplement to Nos.Â 73â74 afford an idea of what
this deal has led to. Iskra no longer prints resolutions of
Majority committees or else gives them space in the supplement, which is
not even put on sale (after No.Â 74 resolutions on the congress were
received from the Caucasus: from the Caucasian Union Committee, and the
Tiflis, Baku and Mingrelia-Imeretia committees), and there are also
resolutions from the Odessa (37Â signatures) and Moscow
prisons. Iskra has started a column in favour of Party peace where
resolutions against the congress are printed.  
 

It is somehow unbelievable that the Saratov Committee should have come
out against the congress and for the C.C. declaration. Please send as
soon as possible all the resolutions of the Saratov Committee, and let
us know what sort of an organ Svobodnoye Slovo is, the Minority
says it is in possession of all the contacts. Please send us all the
committeeâs publications for recent months, or at least a list of them, and
let us know how the work is going, how it has been organised, whether they
have literature, and whether there are contacts with the peasants. Send us
material for publication, make a special effort to get people in the
periphery to write; after all there is plenty to write about.  

Can you connect us with Astrakhan and the Urals?  

All the best.  

Written on Leninâs instructions.

Dear Comrade, 

Our mutual
friend[1]

has told me about the letters you have at your
disposal[5] (letters from a C.C. member abroad to C.C. members in Russia
where it is stated that the Minority abroad has become high-handed and that
the resolution of
       theÂ 22[2]

unquestionably reflects the real will of the Party). I think you ought to
send these letters to me here at once.  
 

In the first place, I am a member of the C.C. and there fore have every
right to be informed of the correspondence between a C.C. member abroad and
members in Russia, all the more since this correspondence deals with the
stand taken by the Minority, a question which concerns the whole
Party. Surely you will not help C.C. members who have defected to the
Minority to conceal from the Party (and even from other C.C. members) the
real state of affairs?  

Secondly, the letters show that some members of the C.C. (Glebov,
Konyagin and Nikitich) are simply not telling the truth when they speak in
their letter to the Russian committees of the conciliatory attitude of the
Minority abroad. Once we have declared open war on this Bonapartism, this
deception of the Party (Galyorka in his pamphlet declared this war on
behalf of all of us), it is our direct duty to expose before the Party any
deception on the part of C.C. members. If, having in our possession proof
of such deception, we failed to bring this proof to the attention of the
Party, we would not be doing our duty to the Party. If we speak of
Bonapartism in the press and from the public platform and at the same time
miss the opportunity to offer documentary proof of that Bonapartism, we
will be simply windbags. After all, we use the word Bonapartism not as
invective, as Martov and Plekhanov have used it.  

It is sometimes said that private letters should not be used in
political struggle. This is not so. When private letters reveal abuses by
Party functionaries, such letters should by all means be used. Plekhanov
used private letters in his
      Vademecum[3]

not even in relation to functionaries. Besides, the letters in question are
not private letters at all, they are the correspondence of C.C. members on
C.C. business. And I, as a member of the C.C., and you, as an agent of the
C.C., are in duty bound to foil this attempt to conceal the truth from the
Party.  

For all these reasons I consider it imperative that you at once send me
these letters or, at any rate, complete copies of them. Of course, parts of
them are confidential, and we shall never make these public. But that which
concerns

  Â  

the interests of the entire Party and contains nothing confidential must be
divulged. How to do this and when, is something we shall think about here.


Reply to this letter without fail and as soon as possible. It
doesnât matter how badly you write Russian. You can even write in Yiddish
if you wish. But let it be immediately.  

If you do not agree with me about sending the letters, we shall all
have to ask you to come here as soon as possible, within a few
days. This is such an important matter that it must be discussed and
decided at all costs.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 N.Â Lenin 

P.S. Be sure to tell
Nih.Â Iâch,[4]

the âJacobinâ and Zhitomirsky that they should send me
their addresses at once. It is a downright disgrace that everyone
should drift around on his own without keeping in touch with one another.

26/XI.  

Dear Comrade, 

Both copies of your resolution received. They were not turned over to
the Central Organ because recently the following happened. The Nikolayev
Committee sent a resolution to be forwarded to Iskra, which was
done. The resolution was returned by Martov accompanied by gross abuse. The
C.C. and the Central Organ, he said, knew for certain

  Â  

that there was no committee in Nikolayev and that the resolution had
therefore obviously been written by some frauds and impostors. Since the
resolution bore no signatures, no date, and no indication of the attitude
of the periphery to it, it was meaningless, he said, and he, Martov, even
refused to forward it to the Central Organ, declaring he was sick and tired
of all this fabrication of false resolutions. The same fate evidently
awaits the Tver resolution. We shall print it in a Majority leaflet.  

Please let us know how things are going.  

Did you receive the Iskra letter to the Party organisations
concerning the Zemstvo campaign? In it, the editors in their striving for a
ânew and higher typeâ talked a lot of nonsense, including the absurdity
that the workers should not frighten away the liberals but act so as not to
cause panic among them. The letter has caused a heated debate. Lenin
replied to it in his pamphlet The Zemstvo Campaign and âIskraâsâ
      Plan.[2]


Please let us have addresses to which we can send literature. The
addresses you sent the resolution to are quite alright. A certain Rogova
will come to you from Perm. She is said to be a good worker. We do not know
her personally but perhaps she will be of use to you. Her status is
illegal, please help her to get settled.  

The key for communicating with Bolshak is Gambetta:
South American statesÂ 34b., Ð¹ in the middle. Bolshak asks that a
passport and small files be sewn into the soles of a pair of boots and
passed on to him through Nekrasova or relatives.  

Please acknowledge receipt of our letters at once. Greetings.  

Lenin

28/XI.  

Dear Comrades, 

Both your letters, of the 23rd and the 28th, received; the first (with
the statistics and addresses) got into the hands of the Minority and was
delivered to us only today. We have made out the addresses, the address for
literature will be used at once. Your resolution in favour of the congress
was received and forwarded to the Central Organ. We have not heard of any
recount of votes, and there hardly will be one.  

The resolution of the Nikolayev Committee was received recently and
forwarded to the Central Organ. Martov re turned it with gross abuse,
saying that the Central Organ and the C.C. knew for certain that there was
no committee in Nikolayev (a downright lie, for the C.C. went with its
declaration to the Nikolayev Committee and knows very well that the persons
who signed the resolution are in the Nikolayev Committee), that the
resolution had been sent by some impostors and frauds who had forged
it.... The resolution of the Caucasian Union Committee in favour of the
congress was not printed, but anotherÂ ... against the congress was
printed. Iskra said that the Saratov, Samara, Urals and Astrakhan
committees had endorsed the C.C. policy (the resolutions were not given),
but the very same day the issue came out we received a letter from the
Urals saying they had not heard from the C.C. for several months and that
they did not know in general whether the Party existed at all. Plekhanov is
openly saying that there is not going to be any congress.... As for the
C.C., it hypocritically declares that now it is not against the congress,
but that it is necessary to make sure that the congress will really
represent the opinion of the Party.... The C.C. is pigeon-

  Â  

holing the committeesâ resolutions, and in its letter to Party comrades it
says: ânow that the Party has declared for usâ....  

The committees have asked the C.C. for Majority literature but the
C.C. has refused to ship it, claiming firstly that it is not Party
literature, and secondly, that it cannot contribute in any way to
developing the class-consciousness of the proletariat. What hypocrisy! I
suppose Trotskyâs new pamphlet issued by the new Iskra and
therefore to some ex tent representing its âCredoâ does contribute a
great deal to the development of the class-consciousness of the
proletariat.... The pamphlet declares that there is a wide gulf between the
old and the new Iskra, that the Congress was a reactionary attempt
to perpetuate sectarian methods of struggle, that the old Iskra
did not care about the proletariat, that the Iskra supporters call
the proletariat block-heads, etc., etc. No wonder Struve praised the
Minority tendencies as vital... (see Leninâs leaflet âAn Obliging
      Liberalâ[2]

).

Did you get the Iskra letter to all Party organisations on the
Zemstvo campaign? In its striving for a new, âhigherâ type of propaganda
and agitation, Iskra talks a lot of nonsense, going so far as to
say that demonstrations should be organised with caution so as not to cause
a panic among the Zemstvo people. Lenin has replied to this letter in his
pamphlet The Zemstvo Campaign and âIskraâsâ
     Plan.[3]


Now that the C.C. has made a deal with the Central Organ not to allow
the congress to be held, it will be postponed indefinitely. Nevertheless
the Majority has resolved to fight for it, but it can succeed only if it is
fully united and properly organised.  

Well, thatâs all for the time being.  

All the best,

 Lenin

Moscow, 29/XI.  

Dear Comrades, 

Your resolution received. Thanks for the promised
support.[1] Please let us know how things stand in the committee. Will
this address do for letters?  We are not sure, and hence are writing
briefly although there is much to write
about.[2] Acknowledge receipt of this at once.  

With comradely greetings,

 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the resolution referred to, adopted in the autumn of 1904, the
Moscow Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. voiced its full support of Leninâs views
and wholly endorsed his work towards the âcreation of a really strong
proletarian partyâ, and promised him every assistance in organising a
publishing house of Bolshevik literature.





[2]
Many members of the Moscow Party organisation were arrested in the
summer and autumn of 1904. Because of this, Lenin feared that the
clandestine address of the Moscow Committee he had might be known to the
police and the letter might fall into their hands.

Baku, 29/X1.  

Dear Friends, 

We are complying with your request, and are sending a trial consignment
of half a pood of our own literature for the time being, so as not to have
to buy any. If the trial proves successful we shall send you what you ask
for. In addition, we have arranged to send parcels to the address given by
       Raisa.[2]

We were very glad to hear about Lenochka. Why does she not write? The
others are none too punctual either. Did you receive our letter of
    NovemberÂ 10?[3]

 

It is increasingly clear that the Council will not allow the congress
to be held on any account. Plekhanov says so quite openly: no congress! At
best the Central Organ throws the committeesâ resolutions into the
waste-paper basket or returns them with gross abuse, as was done in the
case of the Nikolayev Committee, which sent in a resolution in favour of
the congress, but not in the form prescribed by the Council, for which the
authors of the resolution were branded as frauds, impostors, forgers of
resolutions.... To compel the Council to call the congress, the
Majority must organise properly, as Lenin wrote in his last letter. Did you
get the Iskra letter to Party members about the Zemstvo campaign?
(See letter to the Mingrelia-Imeretia
     Committee.)[4]


Well, thatâs all for now. Send material for publication. The Majority
is thinking of publishing its own organ. The hypocritical behaviour of the
Party institutions is impelling it more and more to take this step.  

We have received a letter from the Caucasian Union Committee (through
the Editorial Board of the Central Organ), and shall reply shortly.  

Greetings,
 Lenin 

P.S. What is happening in Batum? What is the mood there?

5/XII.  

Dear Comrade, 

We have received:
1) the statement of the elected representatives of the class-conscious
   workers in the Baku

  Â  

R.S.D.L.P. Committee concerning the reorganisation of the committee;
2) the Balakhany and Bibi-Eibat workersâ leaflet of OctoberÂ 20;
3) the Baku Committeeâs leaflet âThe New Fox-Tail Policyâ;
4) the necessary explanation, and
5) the statement of NovemberÂ 9. We do not have the resolution of the Baku
Committee or the resolution of the conference of Caucasian committees which
we have been told was sent to us.  

As regards the âstatementâ the following must be said. Some time ago
(in the summer) a detailed letter was received from the C.C. representative
in the Caucasus concerning the Minority affair. The letter was immediately
forwarded to the Central Organ, which means that the Council was well aware
of his opinion, as was C.C. member Glebov, who took part in investigating
the matter.  

The Majority is putting out a pamphlet, The Council Against the
Party, which will examine the matter in detail on the basis of the
opinion of the C.C. representative in the
Caucasus.[2] 

Please let us know what size parcels sent from Sosnowice should
be. Reply as soon as possible.  

A violent controversy is now under way between the editors of
Iskra and the Majority on the question of the Zemstvo
campaign. The editors circulated an absurd letter âfor Party members
onlyâ in which they thoroughly confused the issue of the attitude towards
the Zemstvo people. Lenin replied with the pamphlet The Zemstvo
Campaign and âIskraâsâ
      Plan.[1]

There is nothing confidential about the question, and it is important
enough to warrant open discussion.  

Therefore demand that the Editorial Boardâs letter on the Zemstvo be
reprinted for everybody to read. For it is disgraceful to say one thing in
Iskra and another in a letter to Party members. This is a matter
of concern for all. Parvus sent in a letter supporting Leninâs viewpoint
and opposing that of the Minority. We have sent you the pamphlet The
Zemstvo Campaign and âIskraâsâ Plan.


Tell Lenochka that her letter has been received; it got into the hands
of the Minority and was passed on to us

  Â  

opened. I shall write her in a few days. Sheâs much too pessimistic....


With comradely greetings,

 Lenin

12/XII.Â 04 

Dear Leiteisen, 

Today we finally, and practically, settled the question of the
organ. We propose to begin publishing as of January 1â10; the size will be
half the old Iskra (something like
Osvobozhdeniye)â100,000 characters, or roughly four rages of the
old Iskra. It should come out fortnightly, and still better,
weekly.[2] 

The cost will be about 400Â frs. an issue. For one issue we
have the money, and for the restâpromises.... This is on the
short side, and the initial period is especially hard going. Because of
this, remembering your offer, I turn to you: consider the question
thoroughly and write how much you could give to help; we shall count on you
in an emergency (besides promises of a âbig sumâ from Russia, we have
some âprospectsâ of getting a few hundred francs here, and then, apart
from this, so far in the past three or four months there has always been a
thousand or two francs available for pamphlets). It would be good to know
the maximum we can be sure of getting from you in an emergency,
when we are unable to raise money anywhere and the paper is threatened with
death.  

Now about writing for us; We count on having you as our permanent
correspondent covering the French movement. We should carry 8,000â12,000
characters once in two weeks about French socialism and working-class
movement, etc. Let us have something without fail by JanuaryÂ 1.

 

Further. Since you are au courant as regards French political life (as
you told me yourself) and are in a position to follow the latest
literature, sometimes better than from Paris, perhaps you could keep us
posted on, and at times obtain and forward to us, or review, etc.,
interesting new books, articles and items published in journals, and the
like. The foreign press now writes a great deal about
Russia. There is much that never comes to our knowledge; you see far more
newspapers, journals, books. For instance, I recently happened to read
about the book Rouble et roublards by a French correspondent who
fled from Russia after the outbreak of the war. It would be extremely
important for the paper to keep abreast of such new books and to carry
articles about them. Please give this serious thought and render us
all-round literary assistance. Draw our attention to interesting
new publications and send us items and extracts from socialist
newspapers and journals which we could translate for the paper, etc. For
you probably follow practically the entire French (and
    Belgian?[1]

)

socialist press, donât you?  

Bear in mind, then, that we are seriously counting on you.


You must come here on Christmas. It is most important to talk things
over, at leisure, thoroughly, concretely.  

Did you write Plekhanov about the âZemstvoâ views of the new
Iskra? Their letter is stupid, isnât
it?[3] And Starover in No.Â 78 is simply delightful.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin 

By the way, Could you send me material to refute Staroverâs reference
to Clemenceau? For it is
incorrect.[4] Please get the material and send it to me. It would be
edifying to refute him factually.  
 

Notes

In a letter from the editors of the Menshevik Iskra published
in November 1904, the Mensheviks put forward as the Social-Democratsâ main
task the âorganised influencing on the bourgeois oppositionâ by
presenting demands to the government through bourgeois liberals and Zemstvo
leaders.

Your second letter received. The first did not reach
us. Congratulations on the successful start of the raid on Bukva, which we
would ask you to carry to the end. The paper has been launched, we expect
to put it out in January. (Money is desperately needed. Please do
everything you can at once to send at least 1,000â2,000 rubles, otherwise
we shall be in the air and everything will be left to chance.) Let us know
at once:
1) when will you see Bukva and when do you hope to clear up the matter,
2) exactly how much has Bukva promised to give per month?
3) did you speak to Bukva about Sysoika and what did you say?
4) what was the nature of the meeting between Bukva and Charushnikov
to have been (concerning a talk with Sysoika? general acquaintance? or the
handing over of the money?)? Did the meeting take place and when will you
know the results?

Dear Comrade, 

Many thanks for your letter and the beginning (the end has not
yet reached us) of the article âIskraâs Military
Campaignâ. I was especially happy to receive your letter since we hear so
rarely from Russia, so rarely do people write us not âin duty boundâ but
to exchange ideas. Please write more often and collaborate more closely
with our new organ, which we shall begin publishing in the near future

  Â  

(we are sending a detailed letter about the paper to the Caucasian League
with a request that it be passed on to you
 too[1]

;

ask for it and bring it to the attention of as many comrades sharing the
Majority views as you possibly can). I would say that your article is
unquestionable evidence of your literary ability, and I ask you not to give
up writing. It is quite possible that even this article could be adapted
and revised for publication (in its present form, as you remarked yourself,
it is somewhat out of date). Try to answer this letter as soon as possible
and to establish direct contact with us by letter, to correspond
regularly. This is of utmost importance considering the scanty flow of
literary contributions from Russia. Write also about local affairs, and
what Majority literature you have seen.  

With comradely greetings,

 Lenin

Dear Comrades, 

Your letter received. Nadsonâs poem The Songs of
Mephistopheles.[1]

We have sent only two letters direct to you, yet you acknowledge receipt of
three.... Why donât you reply as regards the Zemstvo campaign and write
anything about local affairs? The conciliators claim the Tver Committee
tends to side with them, and cite as proof your contribution printed in
Iskra No.Â 79 and signed âTver Committeeâ. We sent you a letter
through a comrade announcing the publication of the new Majority paper
Vperyod. In it we

  Â  

explain in detail what compelled us to start the paper, what its tasks are,
and so on. Let us know whether you have received this detailed letter and
what you think of it. For Godâs sake write us about the state of affairs,
about local work. We know nothing about work in Tver at present, whether
you have literature and technical facilities, whether leaflets are
published and what kind, how extensive the committeeâs contacts are, how
the Zemstvo campaign is being conducted, and so on and so forth. Repeat
about 1) Rogova, 2) Bolshak, 3) Dedushka.Â â 

Lenin

Let me know what this means: whether you did not get the letter, or whether

Dear Comrades, 

Your statement received. We do not know what the bureau wrote. We shall
communicate what we know. Some time ago we forwarded to you the resolutions
of the conference of Southern committees and the reply of the participants
in the conference of the 22. A slight correction has to be made in your
assertion that the Southern committees proposed that the group of 22
appoint a Bureau of the Majority Committees from among its
members. It was pro posed that the participants in the conference of the 22
name the comrades they thought best suited for the bureau. From the reply
of the participants in the conference of the 22 it can be seen that they in
no way considered themselves empowered to âappointâ anyone; instead they
put forward a list of nominees and asked the committees to introduce
changes or additions in it as they saw fit. You have received that letter,
havenât you? The Southern comrades also took the same view, and, not
agreeing with the list proposed, nominated Ryadovoi and
Zemlyachka for the Bureau (a minor point: all the nominees are in
Russia with the exception of two, and of these one has just come from
Russia and is going there again). So far as we know, their nomination
coincided with the choice of the Caucasian Bureau. But these persons did
not feel they had the right to take any steps before the conference of the
Northern committees, which has already taken place. Hereâs its
     resolution.[1]

Thus 13 committees (4 Caucasian+3 Southern+6 Northern) have declared for
the congress and the establishment of the Bureau of the Majority
Committees. As you can see, every thing is being done to enable the
committees in Russia to come to an agreement. Other committees besides the
thirteen have also declared for the congress; the Central Committee itself
admits that 16 have already declared for the

  Â  

congress, but it now maintains that 19 are needed (this is what the Odessa
Committee was told).  

In any case the Majority committees should hurry up and organise. In a
few days you will receive documents from which you will see how the
C.C. negotiations with the Minority began and how they ended: with the
retention by the Minority of the autonomy of the technical institutions and
the co-opting (so far unofficial) into the C.C. of three of the most ardent
Mensheviks whose inclusion in the C.C. the Minority had insisted on from
the very beginning. The Mensheviks have begun to run things their own
way. The Petersburg business is proof of this. The workers were eager for a
demonstration, the committee set the date for the 28th, but in many
districts the organisers were Mensheviks (the Petersburg Committee
considered it impossible to exclude the Mensheviks from the work) and they
conducted vigorous agitation throughout against the committee. The C.C. did
not supply the committee with literature; the Mensheviks had the literature
but of course did not give it to the committee, and in their districts they
did not prepare for the demonstration. Three days before the demonstration
the Mensheviks disrupted a meeting of the committee and, taking advantage
of the absence of three Bolsheviks, called off the demonstration; 15,000
leaflets were burnt, and when the Bolsheviks, horrified, got another
meeting together it was already too late, nothing could be done any more,
and hardly any workers showed up for the demonstration. There is seething
indignation against the committee, and the Mensheviks who caused all this
mess are breaking away, carrying with them nearly all districts, and are
receiving sup port in the form of literature, contacts and money. Now there
are two committees in Petersburg. Undoubtedly the same will happen in other
cities. The Mensheviks have no scruples and, having seized the C.C., the
Central Organ and the Council, will pursue a line which will leave the
Majority completely Out of the picture. This is no battle of principles. It
is the most outrageous mockery of the Party and principles. This is why we
began to publish our own organ. There is a complete split in the Party and
there must be no procrastination if we do not wish to reconcile ourselves
to the sacrifice of Party principle to clannishness, to absence of

  Â  

principle prevailing in the Party for a long time to come, or its being
thrown back to Economism and the Rabocheye Dyelo approach.

Yesterday we heard about the split in Petersburg. Well,
well! Theyâre a cunning lot, you can see they stop at nothing....  

Maybe this at least will shake up the Bolsheviks and make them realise
that one has to fight actively or these scoundrels will split all the
     committees.[1]

Geneva, 13.I.Â 05 

Dear Sirs, 

Enclosed you will find my statement in reply to yours in Iskra
No.Â 77.[2] My representatives in the arbitration are Comrades Schwarz
and Voinov. Address for communication with them: forwarding office of the
newspaper Vperyod, for so-and-so.  

N.Â Lenin 

Sent in two envelopes to the address: Mr. P.Â Axelrod.  4.Â Bd. Pont
dâArve. 4.  
 

Notes
 

[1]
The letter has the word Ã¢ÂÂCopyÃ¢ÂÂ on it in Leninâs hand.âEd. 
 



[2]
The statement Lenin sent to the Bolshevik conciliators L.Â B. Krasin,
V.Â A. Noskov and L.Â Y. Galperin, members of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., was
written in connection with the Ã¢ÂÂJuly DeclarationÃ¢ÂÂ of the C.C. (see
NoteÂ 76).  

In July 1904 the three C.C. members passed, without Leninâs knowledge,
a resolution recognising as lawful the co-opting by

 Â  

Plekhanov into the Iskra Editorial Board of Mensheviks who had
been voted down by the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., and forbidding
Lenin to take any important action as C.C. representative abroad unless
empowered to do so by the C.C., there by depriving him of his powers as the
Partyâs representative abroad.  

Although Lenin on AugustÂ 18, 1904, challenged the resolution inasmuch
as he had not been invited to the C.C. meeting or even informed that the
question would be taken up, the resolution was printed in Iskra
No.Â 72 on AugustÂ 25.  

On NovemberÂ 5, Iskra No.Â 77 carried a statement of the
C.C. accusing Lenin, who continued to consider himself a member of the
C.C. and said so publicly, of doing so allegedly Ã¢ÂÂwith the object of
disorganising the PartyÃ¢ÂÂ. The C.C. proposed that the conflict be submitted
to arbitration by leaders of international Social-Democracy.

Dear Comrade, 

Your article Ã¢ÂÂWhat Are We To Do?Ã¢ÂÂ is not suitable for
publication. You are creating a non-existent
difference. We

  Â  

have so many serious differences that we must refrain from breeding new
ones. Who has spoken, and where, specially about breaking up
anything by
force?[1] Nobody, I believe. It was merely conceded as an
inevitable result irrespective of our wishes. We urged
people to go to the meetings even if they had to force
their way in in order to propagate our slogans. I grant that the
presentation of ideas was at times clumsy, but to cavil at this would be to
repeat the foul methods of the new Iskra. You of course do not
wish to cavil, that is unquestionable. But you do not in any way prove that
there has been Ã¢ÂÂtactlessnessÃ¢ÂÂ. And to say that Ã¢ÂÂall tactics should
consist in tactÃ¢ÂÂ and the like, why, thatâs altogether Ã¢ÂÂoff the markÃ¢ÂÂ.


With comradely greetings,

 N.Â Lenin

Dear Sir, 

I thank you for your letter of FebruaryÂ 24. Of course I agree, on
behalf of my organisation (the paper Vperyod and the Russian
Bureau of the Committees of the Majority of the Social-Democratic Labour
Party of Russia), to accept your conditions and promise to carry them
out. The receipt for the sums of Â£60 and Â£20, with indication

  Â  

of their destination, will be printed in our paper Vperyod.  

I must apologise for my bad English.  

Yours very sincerely,

 Vl.Â Oulianoff

During the 1904 strikes in Russia, Russian Social-Democratic
organisations in London set up a Russian Strike Relief Commit tee, which
appealed to British trade unions for assistance. It was also decided to
turn to the Labour Representation Committee, of which Ramsay MacDonald was
secretary. The Committee responded, on condition that part of the money be
used to help the widows and orphans of the numerous victims of the
JanuaryÂ 9 (22), 1905, massacre.

The Labour Representation Committee (Secretary MacDonald), a
British proletarian organisation, has sent 60 pounds sterling
    (1,506Â francs)[1]

through the editors of Vperyod in aid of the widows and orphans of
workers who fell on JanuaryÂ 9 (22) in St.Â Petersburg.  The editors of
Vperyod have forwarded this money to the St.Â Petersburg Committee
of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party with the request that the
donation be brought without fail to the attention of all workersâ
organisations of our Party without exception (district committees, meetings
of organisers, factory groups, etc.) which could themselves help properly
to distribute the funds. It would be desirable that the workers themselves
acknowledge the receipt of the money to their British comrades.  

Besides the 60Â pounds sterling for the victims, the Labour
Representation Committee at the same time sent another 20Â pounds sterling
to Vperyod to be used for the needs of the uprising.  

Now, MarchÂ 13 (FebruaryÂ 28), the editors of Vperyod have
received from the same Committee another 90Â pounds sterling (about
900Â rubles) of which 50Â pounds (about 500Â rubles) is for aid to the orphans
and widows of the workers

  Â  

who fell in the fight for freedom. We shall collect this money in a few
days and send it on to Petersburg.  

Since some workers have friends in London the exact address of this
Committee might come in handy. Here it is: Labour Representation Committee,
Victoria Mansions, 28, Victoria Street. London. S.W. Secretary J.Â Ramsay
MacDonald.  

Reply to this letter without fail.

Dear Comrade, 

We shall reply in detail to your letter in a few days. This is merely a
hurried note to let you know the following:
If there are organisers who side with the Majority, do one of two things at
once:
1) send in their name a letter to the congress protesting
against the committee and expressing a desire to take part in the congress;
2) if you find 50Â rubles and someone to send, then send a delegate to us
(to our address in Geneva) without delay, supplying him with a credential
written in our cipher.  

Good-bye for the present. Shall write more in a few days. Now please
donât delay and try to comply with our request at once, better the second
than the first.

19/4.Â 05 

Dear L., 

It is impossible to get an Organising Committee credential for you to
deliver greetings to the
congress.[2] I thought at first that our congress would open by AprilÂ 22
and that it would issue you a credential, hut that did not work out; our
congress is being
       delayed.[1]

You can say you are speaking for the Editorial Board of Vperyod
and deliver greetings to the congress in its name, and through it,
in the name of the R.S.D.L.P. That will be the best.  

The item about Martovâs lies is going
in.[3] Write from the congress.  

Yours,
 V.Â Ulyanov 

P.S. In Neue Zeit No.Â 29 Kautsky again told a pack of lies
about Vperyod and
Iskra![4] It would be a good thing for you to âcorrectâ him
in your speech at the congress.  
 

Notes
 

[1]
The Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. opened on AprilÂ 12 (25),
1905.âEd.  
 



[2]
The reference is to the Congress of the French Socialists held April
23â25, 1905, in Paris, at which the followers of Guesde and JaurÃ¨s
united.





[3]
This refers to Y.Â 0. Martovâs article âA Party Congress or a Congress
of Groups?â in Iskra No.Â 94, MarchÂ 25, 1905. In it Martov held up
the Guesdists as an example to the âLeninistsâ, falsely asserting that
the Guesdists had recourse to mediation by Bebel and the German
Social-Democrats. Leiteisen replied to Martov in an item entitled âA
Slight Correction!â in Vperyod No.Â 15, AprilÂ 20 (7).





[4]
Kautskyâs article âDie Differenzen unter den russischen Sozialistenâ,
published in Die Neue Zeit No.Â 29, was printed in Russian
translation in Iskra No.Â 97 under the heading âThe Differences
Between Russian Socialistsâ. The article said: â...Â there are no
revisionists in the Russian party.... He (Lenin.âEd.) stands for
strict centralism and dictatorial rights for the Central Committee, while
Axelrod and his friends want to give more leeway for the activity of the
local committees.â

Dear Comrade, 

We received your letter and were very glad to hear from
you. Congratulations on overcoming the obstacles raised by the notorious
agents appointed to conceal the
truth.[2] Do everything possible to keep in touch with us regularly by
letter. This is urgently necessary. As soon as correspondence is arranged,
we shall give you some interesting assignments.

  Â  

At present we are looking forward to the congress. It is to open in a few
days. The C.C. and Plekhanov still have not made their position quite
clear. It looks as if a split is inevitable. Reply at once if you want to
be informed about the congress sooner and more accurately than anyone else.


Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin,

 your former village
neighbour.[3] Is that peasant
       radical[1]

you used to bring to me still alive? What is his stand now? Why donât you
find us contacts with the peasants?

Dear Comrade, 

Comrade Vas.Â Vas., a member of our Editorial Board, has informed me
that on the whole you share the stand of Proletary95 in
the present disputes on tactics and organisation among the
Social-Democrats. This was very good news for all of us members of the
Editorial Board of Proletary. It is our firm conviction that the
old conflicts of the circle period should under no circumstances impede
joint work on the basis of common principles and strictly Party
relationships. We therefore consider it our duty to invite you to work with
us in Proletary, the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P. We would be
extremely happy if we could thus pave the way to uniting by truly Party
bonds as many influential representatives of Social-Democracy as possible.


With Social-Democratic greetings,

 N.Â Lenin

Geneva, JulyÂ 3, 1905 

Dear Citizen, 

We have received your letter informing us that you have sent
5,049Â frs. 23 to Mr.Â Plekhanov. The head of our for warding office has
written him that we expect half of this sum to be sent to our address.


I should like to let you know, dear citizen, that it was a mistake on
your part to have sent the money to Mr.Â Plekhanov. We have already had the
honour to inform you that since the Third Congress of our Party
Iskra has ceased to be the organ of the Party and that
Mr.Â Plekhanov is no longer the representative of the Party in the
International Bureau. We have also had the honour to inform you that the
Central Committee of our Party has not yet delegated a special
representative to the International Bureau and that in all cases you should
get in touch with Mr.Â Ulyanov.  
 

You advise us to come to an agreement with Mr.Â Plekhanov. You should be
aware that no agreement of any kind is possible between our Party and
Mr.Â Plekhanov until his relations with the Party have been officially
settled. I am therefore obliged to ask you to inform Mr.Â Plekhanov that
half of the sum should be forwarded to the Central Committee of our Party
(to Mr.Â Ulyanov).  

Accept, dear citizen, our fraternal greetings.  

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian
Social-Democratic Party

 Vl.Â Ulyanov (N.Â Lenin)

Geneva, JulyÂ 8, 1905 

Dear Citizens, 

We have received half of the sum you sent to the Russian
Social-Democrats, that is, 2,524Â frs. 61Â 1/2Â centimes. But it was a mistake
to send it to Comrade Plekhanov. We have already had the honour of
informing you that Comrade Plekhanov is no longer the representative of our
Party and that on all questions concerning our Party you should get in
touch only with the Central Committee of our Party, that is, with
Mr.Â Oulianoff, 3 rue do la Colline GenÃ¨ve.  

Accept, dear citizens, our fraternal greetings.  

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party

 N.Â Lenin (Vl.Â Ulyanov)

Dear Vl.Â Dm., 

I am sending you the
      âpaperâ.[1]


Your appointment to the Economic Commission turned out to be
inexpedient for the time being: it would not have lessened but rather
aggravated the friction.  

If need be always get in touch with me. I do not think there is any
reason to fear friction. But of course one must be tactful and cautious
whatever turn things may take.  

I hear there is no paper for the next issue!  

Greetings to V.Â M. Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear An.Â V., 

I am sending you a new pamphlet by Plekhanov. How petty are his sallies
and âdigsâ at the Machists! For me this is all the more disappointing
since essentially Plekhanovâs criticism of Mach is, I believe, correct.


I am thinking of writing a short article entitled âG.Â Plekhanovâs
Latest
Contributionâ.[2] 

Prepare the introduction to your pamphlet Sketches on the History
of the Revolutionary Struggle of the West-European
Proletariat.[3] We shall put out a special one about the February
revolution.[4] 

We have C.C. letters from Russia looking forward to writings by
you.[5] It is very difficult for us without your

  Â  

regular, close collaboration. The paper, true, comes out, but it is
somewhat monotonous as well. Thatâs one thing. Secondly, there are no
pamphlets, especially popular ones. You ought to continue in the vein of
How the Petersburg Workers Went To Petition the Tsar.  

My pamphlet will come out this
week.[1]

I shall send it to you.  

The Congress minutes will probably come out in August.  

Vas.Â Vas. is swamped with routine work and does not write, which is a
great pity.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

14.VIII.  

Dear Comrades, 

I have received a letter and a âstatementâ from Comrade Konstantin
Sergeyevich, and consider it my duty to give the following reply, which I
would ask all members of the St.Â Petersburg Committee to
read. Needless to say, the conflict should be examined, in accordance with
the Rules of the Party, by the Central Committee, and I am far from
presuming to pass judgement from here. But in

  Â  

view of the reference to the âLushin letterâ as emanating from abroad, I
must express my opinion. Lushin is a despicable defector from the Majority
to the Minority, offended for not having been invited to the Third
Congress. The âLushin letterâ was published by the author (in the press)
earlier, before the Third Congress, and contained the absurd charge that
the Majority had shown insufficient resolution(!) in fighting the
Minority. Comrade Konstantin Sergeyevich made a mistake in signing the
letter, but to hold it against him would be the height of
unreasonableness. It was a forgivable mistake for a man unfamiliar with the
âmoresâ (or rather lack of mores) of the Ã©migrÃ©s. Konstantin
Sergeyevich himself dissociated himself at once from this Lushin
person. Having known Konstantin Sergeyevich first as a splendid,
one of the most valuable correspondents, and then having met him
personally in Geneva, I must commend him as a worker, and resolutely
object to the âLushin letterâ being used against
him.[1] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

âLushin letterâââOpen Letter to the Delegates of the
Third Congressâ. Konstantin Sergeyevich (N.Â V. Doroshenko) was re moved
from work in the St.Â Petersburg Committee for having

 Â  

signed it. He was reinstated after Lenin had explained the circumstances.

30.IX.Â 05 

Dear Friends, 

1) I am sending you a draft contract with Malykh for approval by the
entire
C.C.[1] I advise approval, since there are a lot of people here who
have nothing else to live on, and the Party cannot support them (including
editors and contributors of Proletary). This is a serious
question, which I would beg you not to decide offhand; otherwise there is
liable to be a desperate crisis.  

2) I advise raising the 50 perÂ cent to 100 perÂ cent. Malykh ought to
agree.  
 

3) Be sure to get an undertaking from her at once to submit to
ideological guidance (and not only control) by a person to be
agreed upon between herself and the C.C. This is quite possible, she will
agree; this point is enormously important in principle, and its practical
significance for the future will also be very great.  

4) You are placing me and especially yourselves in an impossible
position vis-Ã -vis the International Bureau by not appointing a
representative to the conference and not sending C.C. members here as
promised.[2] For heavens sake canât you see that in this way you are
setting the entire international Social-Democracy against you. I already
have an inquiry from the International Bureau concerning the strange
silence of the C.C. (I replied that you agree in principle to a conference
without arbitration, that you will soon send delegates, and that talks are
now going on in Russia between the Organising Commission and the C.C.).


It is necessary to give the International Bureau a precise and clear
official answer, otherwise you will seriously compromise yourselves, it
will look as if you were evading the
issue.[3] 

5) I have lost all hope of your coming. Why didnât you write a word
about the end of Sysoika? Let me know whether you have definitely given up
the idea of coming. In general there has been no news from you about anyone
for over a month.  

6) As regards Plekhanov, I can pass on some local rumours for your
information. He is obviously angry with us for having exposed him in the
eyes of the International Bureau, he swears like a stevedore in No.Â 2 of
Dnevnik
Sotsial-Demokrata.[4] There is talk of his putting out his own
paper, or returning to Iskra. The conclusion: he should be
regarded with growing distrust.  

Best regards. Let me have at least some sort of a reply.  

Yours,
 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The contract with the publishing firm of Maria Malykh (Edelman) was
drawn up after the latter had approached Lenin with an offer to publish a
number of works by him and other Bolshevik writers.  

The contract never materialised since, as P.Â P. Rumyantsev informed
Lenin in his reply to the present letter, the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. had
simultaneously begun negotiating in St.Â Petersburg with the Znaniye
Publishers, founded by K.Â P. Pyatnitsky and Maxim Gorky. In his reply,
Rumyantsev asked Lenin for permission to sign the contract with Znaniye. On
OctoberÂ 2 (15) Lenin cabled his agreement (see DocumentÂ 125). The contract
with Znaniye was signed on OctoberÂ 21 (8), 1905, by L.Â B. Krasin and
P.Â P. Rumyantsev.





[2]
A reference to a conference proposed by the International Socialist
Bureau with a view to uniting the R.S.D.L.P. (see Leninâs letter to the
I.S.B. of SeptemberÂ 16, 1905, present edition, Vol.Â 9, p.Â 252).





[3]
The C.C., R.S.D.L.P. informed Lenin in a letter dated OctoberÂ 3 (16),
1905, that it had appointed as its representatives at the conference Lenin,
F.Â V. Lengnik and P.Â P. Rumyantsev. Lenin informed the I.S.B. of this on
OctoberÂ 14 (27), 1905 (see present edition, Vol.Â 9, pp.Â 390â91).





[4]
Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata (Diary of a Social-Democrat) was
published in Geneva by G.Â V. Plekhanov at irregular and lengthy intervals
from March 1905 to April 1912, 16Â issues in all. Dnevnik resumed
publication in Petrograd in 1916, but only one issue came out.  

No.Â 2 of the publication (August 1905) carried an article by Plekhanov,
âSelected Passages from Correspondence with Friends (A Letter to the
Editors of Proletary)â, intended as a reply to Leninâs âOn the
Provisional Revolutionary Government. Article One. Plekhanovâs Reference to
Historyâ (see present edition, Vol.Â 8, pp.Â 463â74) and accusing Lenin and
the Bolsheviks of Blanquism.

16.X.Â 05 

Dear Comrades, 

I have talked to Ivan Vasilichâs messenger and yesterday sent a
telegram giving my consent. I authorise Ivan Vasilich or Sergei Vasilich to
make the necessary cuts in the
Poor,[2] if it is taken away from Petrov. I agree to its being
taken from Petrov, but only on condition that this will not mean a break
with Petrov, or a sheer deception of Petrov on my part, since I gave
Petrov permission to try to arrange this thing. This means it is
necessary
1) at least to compensate Petrov for expenses already incurred (Ivan
Vasilichâs messenger agreed to this);
2) to get Petrovâs consent to submit to the decision of the higher body
(i.e., I permitted Petrov to make a try, while the C.C. decided to hand it
over to Belovâso that Petrov should not have reason to consider me an
unreliable business partner). If Petrov has already succeeded in arranging
things, I would strongly

  Â  

advise against taking it away from him, for I do not see how Belov is
better than Petrov;
3) please get in touch with my
sister[1]

on this matter (she can easily be communicated with), since she might have
already made some arrangements in my name.  

As for Petrov, I shall inform everybody here that
1) the C.C. did not endorse the contract;
2) we are within our rights in negotiating with Petrov on each separate
instance since no monopoly has been established;
3) it is advisable to deal with the C.C. publishers as more advantageous
and closer to the Party.  

That seems to be all. Write and let me know whether I have understood
you correctly.  

Your agreement with Nolin is good, but I am afraid it might be
fictitious. An âeditorial committeeâ=7â4â1=2!! And these two are
burdened with other things!! This is a fiction, not an editorial
committee. Besides, after signing an agreement with Nolin you all give
heaps of work (Radin, Kamenev, Werner, Schmidt, Lyadov, Bazarov,
Fedorovich, etc., etc.Â âunless Belov has deceived me?) to Belov. What
does this mean? Nolin for the soul and Belov for the body, is that it? If
our meeting does not take place, you will be kind enough to explain to me
thoroughly by letter what is the matter. It is altogether out of the
question for people in the underground or members of the R.S.D.L.P. to
engage in the complex and bothersome business of publishing. That is why
Belov (and Petrov no less than Belov) is getting ahead of us. And I
seriously warn you that that is how it will be, for Belov has enterprising
people who give themselves wholly to the business, while Nolinâs
âeditorial committeeâ (you can be sure) will not be able to devote even
one-hundredth of its energies to this work. We shall keep on
talking, arguing, bargaining, holding meetings (we have been engaged in
this laudable occupation ever since summer, for six months), while
Belov and Petrov will do business. I am not blaming anybody, for it would
be absurd to do thatâit is inevitable under the circumstances. This will
change
1) if freedom is wonâand then everything will change; or
2) if Pyatnitsky goes about it

  Â  

like Belov and Petrov, which he cannot do since he is occupied
with a host of other things.  


P.S. Received Rabochy No.Â 2. I shall write you about the
feuilleton in detail. The author should not have tackled such subjects: the
result is a sort of âsentimentalâ socialism, which is very
dangerous.[3]

17.X.Â 05 

Dear Comrade, 

The Scholtz affair has taken such a turn that the Party is likely to
suffer a serious loss through the fault of the manager of the printing
shop.[2] 

Besides, fulfilment by the Party printery of Demos orders also involves
losses for the Party since things are not properly handled.  

In view of this and considering that the affairs of Demos, supervision
over which has been entrusted to me by the Central Committee,
cannot require your presence in London later than OctoberÂ 21 (new
style), I urgently request you, on agreement with Iv.Â P., to give
up the trip to Berlin and to leave at once for Geneva to settle
the matters entrusted to you by the C.C.  

N.Â Lenin 

P.S. I draw your attention to the fact that to refer to Demos business
in justification of your continued absence would not be right on your part,
for I have communicated with I.P. and learned that Demos business equally
requires your immediate return.  
 

P.P.S. Scholtz filed a suit (for 2,031Â frs. 25) On OctoberÂ 17.  Payment
falls due on OctoberÂ 27. We need a few days (a minimum of five) for legal
consultation.

[2]
The Scholtz affairâan impending suit for damages filed by
the Geneva printer Scholtz against the Social-Democratic Demos Publishers
for violation of a contract for the printing of Maxim Gorkyâs play The
Children of the Sun. Demos Publishers was founded abroad in September
1905 and its editors were I.Â P. Ladyzhnikov, Yelena Stasova,
V.Â D. Bonch-Bruyevich and R.Â P. Avramov.  

The Party printing shop which was to set up the play in type did not
observe the time limits stipulated in the contract with Scholtzâs printery
owing to a shortage of type, whereupon the latter presented a claim for
damages.  

According to I.Â P. Ladyzhnikov, the matter was settled out of court by
paying Scholtz a certain sum of money.

Dear Comrades, 

The International Socialist Bureau has forwarded me a letter from
Vaillant setting forth the proposal of the Socialist Workersâ Party of
France. The Bureau has asked me to submit this proposal for discussion by
the central body of my Party and to reply at the earliest date. Vaillantâs
letter is as follows: 

âThe question raised in my letter which you circulated
was to introduce a definite proposal. Today I am sending you this proposal
I could not do so earlier, for to give it sufficient weight it was
necessary that it should come from the party as a whole, from the Socialist
Party (French section of the International Workersâ Party), which has
adopted it unanimously through its delegates at an assembly of the National
Council on Sunday, SeptemberÂ 24 (SeptemberÂ 11), in Paris. The following is
the proposal on which a decision is to be taken after discussion by the
International Socialist Bureau: âAs soon as developments, overt or covert,
give cause to fear a conflict between governments and make war possible,
the socialist parties of th; countries concerned should at once, on
invitation from the I.S.B. contact each other direct with the object of
determining and concentrating the actions of the combined forces of the
workers and socialists to avert and prevent war.  

ââAt the same time the parties of other
countries would be invited by the I.S.B. to a meeting to be held at the
earliest possible date in order to determine what action on the part of the
entire International and the organised workers is most suitable to avert
and prevent war.  

âJaurÃ¨s joins me in asking you to send at once a new
circular letter to all parties. You will understand, as will the socialists
of all countries if they agree with us, how important, in view of the
possible developments, it is not to put off discussion of this question to
a distant meeting of the Bureau, but to inform the Bureau directly of their
agreement; thus, if the proposal is adopted, as we hope it will he, it
could be implemented promptly in the event of a conflict.â  
 

I for my part should like to add that, in my view, this proposal is
somewhat naÃ¯ve, since the only thing that can have an effect in the event
of a conflict between governments is the dictatorship of the proletariat.

At the comradesâ request I givo here
information concerning the Economic Commission in as precise a form as
possible.[2] 

The Economic Commission consists of comrades specially appointed by the
C.C. representative abroad.  

At the present time (OctoberÂ 20, 1905) it includes Comrades
Bonch-Bruyevich (manager of the printing shop), Kruchinina (treasurer and
manager of the forwarding office), Ilyin, Lenina (secretary of the C.C.),
       Abramov,[1]

Knol, Vetchinkin, Ladyzhnikov and Nik.Â Vasilich.  

Generally speaking, the function of the Economic Commission is to
handle the business jobs of the Central Committee abroad, and to help the
Central Committee in all its work abroad. This applies to the technical end
(printing, forwarding, and so forth), finances, transport, sending people
to Russia, measures relating to arms, and so on, co-ordinating the work of
all C.C. agents, controlling the work of each individual agent, and so on,
right up to special assignments from the Central Committee.  

The Economic Commission elects its chairman or secretary, etc., and
distributes work among its members, with

  Â  

the exception of the appointment of permanent functionaries (in charge of
forwarding, the treasury, the secretariat, printing shop, transport, and so
on), which depends on the Central Committee.  

Decisions of the Economic Commission may be revoked by the Central
Committee or its representative abroad, but are not subject to endorsement
by the C.C. unless this is asked for by some member of the Economic
Commission or unless objections are raised by anyone.  

For the purpose of control over the activities of individual agents of
the C.C. (the treasurer, secretary, manager of printing shop, etc.), the
Economic Commission appoints comrades from among its members to make a
thorough examination of the whole work of the given agent and to report to
the Commission on measures to improve his work, and also to check up on the
progress of his work from time to time. The only exceptions are special
activities or spheres of activity exempted for one or another reason by the
Central Committee from control by the Economic Commission. The carrying out
of all ordinary and current work undertaken by the C.C. is to be
systematically controlled by the Economic Commission.  

The Economic Commission helps the Central Committee to direct the
activity of the Committee of the Organisations
Abroad,[3] not in the form of directives to the latter, since it is an
autonomous organisation, but by studying its reports, discussing its work,
examining the organisation of its activities and searching for ways of
improving it.  


If the comrades who asked for a more explicit definition of the
functions of the Economic Commission consider it necessary to draw up a
detailed statute, the Economic Commission as a whole should discuss this
statute, after which it would be endorsed by the C.C.

[2]
After Leninâs departure for Russia in the beginning of November 1905,
the Economic Commission wound up its affairs and sent the library and Party
archives to the ad dress of Branting in Stockholm, where they were stored
for some time in the Peopleâs House (see this volume, DocumentÂ 135).





[3]
The Committee of the Organisations Abroad (C.O.A.)  was
elected at a meeting of R.S.D.L.P. groups abroad in December 1911. The
composition of the committee changed several times. At the conference of
R.S.D.L.P. groups abroad held in Berne from FebruaryÂ 27 to MarchÂ 4, 1915,
Nadezhda Krupskaya, Inessa Armand, G.Â L. Shklovsky, and V.Â M. Kasparov were
elected to it. During the war the committee was in Switzerland where it
conducted, under the direct guidance of Lenin, extensive work to
co-ordinate the activities of the R.S.D.L.P. sections abroad, to combat the
social-chauvinists and to unite the internationalist Left of international
Social-Democracy.

Geneva, OctoberÂ 23, 1905 

Dear L., 

I have just been informed by Bracke of the French Parti Socialiste that
their party congress will take place in ChÃ¢lon-sur-SÃ¢one from October
27â30 to NovemberÂ 1. Le meilleur accord est rÃ©servÃ© aux dÃ©lâeguÃ©s

    lâÃtranger.[1]


Will you be there? Be sure to drop me a line. If you
will, represent us and deliver without fail an exhaustive speech
with greetings from the revolutionary Social-Democracy of Russia.


If not, let me know at once. In that case we shall send a
detailed message of greetings from
here.[2] 

So be sure to reply!  

Yours,

G.Â D. Leiteisen attended the First Congress of the United Socialist
Party of France which opened on OctoberÂ 29, 1905, in ChÃ¢lon. As a token
of solidarity with the revolutionary proletariat of Russia he was included
in the presidium and was unanimously applauded as he took his place on the
platform. A telegram of greetings from Proletary was given a warm
reception. The congress adopted a resolution moved by Paul Lafargue voicing
solidarity with the Russian revolution.

Dear L., 

Please do take the trouble to write a short article or even a paragraph
about your interview with Guesde, Lafargue and Bracke concerning the
provisional revolutionary government and our participation in it. We need
it for Proletary (or for Novaya
Zhizn,[1] depending on the circumstances). You must write, if only
a few lines, and as soon as
possible![2] 

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Novaya Zhizn (New Life)âthe first legal Bolshevik newspaper,
published daily from OctoberÂ 27 (NovemberÂ 9) to DecemberÂ 3 (16), 1905, in
St.Â Petersburg. After Leninâs arrival from abroad in the beginning of
November it came out under his direct guidance. Novaya Zhizn was
in effect the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P.  


On DecemberÂ 2, after 27Â issues had come out, it was sup pressed by the
tsarist government.





[2]
During the ChÃ¢lon Congress of the Socialist Party of France,
G.Â D. Leiteisen interviewed Bracke-Desrousseaux, Paul Lafargue and Jules
Guesde. To the main question concerning their attitude towards the
participation of the Russian Social-Democrats in a provisional
revolutionary government they all answered that they considered such
participation obligatory.  

The replies were published in full in Proletary No.Â 26,
NovemberÂ 25 (12), 1905, under the heading âGuesdists and the Participation
of the Russian Social-Democrats in a Provisional Revolutionary
Governmentâ.

Comrade Dirks, 

Please tell Vl.Â Dm. Bonch-Bruyevich that the Party Programme must be
published at once as a separate pamphlet with cover, list
of publications, address of the forwarding office, etc., and
matrixed.  

I would earnestly ask that first both of you go over it
carefully once more to make sure there is not the slightest
misprint. Check it against the minutes of the Second Congress.  

The price of the pamphlet should be fixed both for single copies and
bundle orders (per 100Â copies, 1,000 copies).

A Mr. G.Â Koukline 15.Â Rue de Candolle. GenÃ©ve.  

Dear Comrade, 

I am extremely worried about the fate of a certain packet of documents
of historical
significance.[1] It was among the papers left in your keeping about
which the editor of an historical journal spoke to you this summer.  

I would be very much obliged to you if you would drop me a line letting
me know whether the packet can be located and sent here; where the suitcase
or box is and whether the packet can be easily found there.  

With Social-Democratic greetings,

 V.Â Ulyanov

March 1(14), 1907 

Dear M.Â Avenard, 

Thank you for your letter.  

I would ask you to make the following corrections: 

(1) PageÂ 6 (No.Â 1). You quote me as saying: ânot to work for the
bourgeois revolution which would dupe the working classâ.  

This is most inaccurate. We Social-Democratic revolutionaries
must not only work for the bourgeois revolution but we must lead
it, direct it, together with the peasantry, against tsarism and
against the liberals.  

Perhaps it would be better to say: â... in joint work, not with the
liberal bourgeoisie, who want to put an end to the revolution, but with the
democratic peasantry, against the baseness and treachery of the
bourgeoisie, who are day by day becoming more and more counter
revolutionaryâ.  

We Bolsheviks also stand for the participation of the
proletariat in the bourgeois revolution. But we believe, with Karl
Kautsky, that it is precisely together with the peasants and by no means
with the liberals that the proletariat can carry the bourgeois revolution
to a victorious conclusion.  

(2) Pages 3â4.  

Stolypinâs article in Novoye
Vremya[2] appeared on JanuaryÂ 4 (old style) and not on JanuaryÂ 6.


(3) It is necessary to add that Milyukov visited Stolypin on
JanuaryÂ 15.  
 

(4) The last words of your article: â... countless masses of peasant
proletarians.â  

Not âpeasant proletariansâ but âdemocratic peasantsâ. In the social
(socialist) revolution we can count only on the proletarians of the cities
and the proletarians of the countryside. At the present time, however, we
have not a social revolution in Russia, but a bourgeois
revolution. And it is only the proletariat together with the peasants,
together with the democratic peasantry, together with the broad masses of
the peasantry, who can bring such a revolution to victory.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin 

P.S. I received your letter very late. I have only a few minutes to
spare. Forgive this hurried reply.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Etienne Avenard was a correspondent of lâHumanitÃ© who had
interviewed Lenin on FebruaryÂ 17 (MarchÂ 2), 1907, on the subject, âTactics
of the R.S.D.L.P. in the Election Campaignâ, and sent the text of the
interview for Lenin to look over.  

As can be seen from the interview as carried by lâHumanitÃ©
all of Leninâs corrections and comments were taken into account by the
correspondent (see present edition, Vol.Â 12, pp.Â 145â51).  

LâHumanitÃ©âa daily founded in 1904 by Jean JaurÃ¨s as the
organ of the French Socialist Party. During the imperialist world war
(1914â18) the newspaper took a social-chauvinist position.  

In 1918 Marcel Cachin, the prominent leader of the French and
international working-class movement, became its political director. Since
December 1920, after the French Socialist Party split and the French
Communist Party was formed, the paper has been the Central Organ of the
latter.





[2]
Novoye Vremya (New Times)âa daily published in
St.Â Petersburg from 1868 to 1917. At first moderate liberal, it turned into
a mouthpiece of reactionary groupings of the nobility and the bureaucratic
officialdom after A.Â S. Suvorin became its publisher in 1876. From 1905 it
was the organ of the Black Hundreds.

Dear P., 

I donât know whether your letter was written before you met our local
friend or after. At any rate I am answering your questions.  

N.Â K. has spoken about the money question many times. She will
mention it again and so shall I.  

I have not written to R. because I myself recently saw (when I
happened to be in those parts) two comrades from there and took up all
matters concerning you with
them.[2] 

You ask what I think about your work there.  

It is rather difficult to answer this question in a few words. When you
have looked around you will see for yourself what material, information,
etc., can be sent from

  Â  

there, but this is a relatively minor problem and can be easily solved. The
general conditions of work there is an other matter. I doubt whether you
have ever seen such foul conditions as those in which the emigrants find
them selves abroad. You must be extremely cautious there. Not that
I am advising against waging war with the opportunists. On the contrary, it
is very necessary to fight there, and much fighting will have to be
done. But it is an ugly kind of war. You must always be prepared for
malicious underhand attacks, outright âprovocationsâ on the part of the
Mensheviks (they will systematically provoke you), and very little
effective sympathy. For over there you are frightfully out of
touch with Russia, and idleness and the state of mind that goes with it, a
nervous, hysterical, hissing and spitting mentality, predominate. The
difficulties you will encounter there have nothing in common with
the difficulties encountered in Russia: though there is practically full
âfreedomâ, there is no live work or an environment for live work
to speak of.  

In my opinion the chief thing is for you to have work, your own
work. R. may provide it.... More important still is it for you to
maintain contact with the organisation in Russia: in that case you
wonât feel rootless there. And, finally, most important of all, we all,
both there and here, should work in unison, march in step,
exchange views more often (if not all views are clearly expressed in the
press). Only by working abroad in contact with the
organisation in Russia can one protect oneself against being
sucked down into the slough of despond, squabbles, the viciousness of
overwrought nerves, etc. My own memory of that âabroadâ is only too
fresh, and I speak from no little experience.  

It would be very good if you would work together with Knunyants and
Trotsky. It would be much easier for you with them.  

Anyway, you will see all this for yourself in time.  

The address you have written to here should not be used on any
account. Besides, I shall be leaving here soon. For the time being write me
at this address: Herrn Kakko Paavo, Terijoki, and inside the
envelope (and only inside) for Lân. Let me have your address
there as soon as possible.  
 

Best regards. Warm greetings to all the Knipoviches.  

Yours,

 ....[1]

included Maxim Gorky, N.Â A. Semashko and M.Â G. Tskhakaya. The âtwo
comradesâ referred to probably were B.Â M. Knunyants and N.Â A. Semashko,
with whom Lenin may have had talks during the Stuttgart Congress of the
Second International.

 Â  

The former was a member of the Bolshevik delegation and the latter attended
the Congress in a private capacity.

Dear Comrade, 

The bearer of this letter is our Party
comrade.[1] I would kindly ask you to give her your advice and
assistance. In particular, she has instructions to look for our
Social-Democratic books and documents in Stockholm and if need be to send
them on. These books, etc., are partly in the basement of the Stockholm
Peopleâs House (in crates), and partly, perhaps, with Comrades
BÃ¶rje&Bwhattheon or BjÃ¶rck (Bokhandel BjÃ¶rck &
BÃ¶rje&Bwhattheon, Drottninggatan. 62).  

I trust that with your help the bearer of this letter will be able to
carry out her assignment, which I consider extremely important.  

With best regards,

 N.Â Lenin

Vperyod and Proletary for 1905) containing articles by
Lenin needed for the third volume of the first, three-volume collection of
his writings he was preparing for the press.

Dear Comrade, 

I have made arrangements with Mr.Â BÃ¶rje&Bwhattheon, but
unfortunately he is not able to ensure the delivery to us of all letters
and parcels. You must forgive me if I there fore once again ask you to find
one more member of the Party who could receive letters and parcels
of books in Stockholm weekly and send them on (to Finland and back
to Geneva).  

I intend to leave for Berlin on
       Tuesday.[1]

13.I.Â 08 

Dear An.Â Vas., 

For several days now my wife and I have been in Geneva.... It is
devilishly sad to have to return to this accursed Geneva again, but thereâs
no other way out! After the disaster in Finland there was no alternative
but to transfer
Proletary[2] abroad. Thatâs what the Editorial Board
decided. The only question is whether to Geneva or some other place. So far
we are making inquiries, but I person ally believe that Geneva and London
are the only places that are free. But London is expensive.  

I read your pamphlet about Stuttgart to the end; the third supplement
came very late, I barely managed to read it before leaving. I think you
made a good job of it, and all the comrades were very pleased with the
      pamphlet.[1]

We all thought it unnecessary to âcorrectâ it; it would have been a pity
to mar your vivid and lively style. And there is no syndicalism in it; what
it does contain, in my opinion, is a number of major indiscretions âfor
use byâ Plekhanov and Co. Did you see his carping and base cavilling in Obrazovaniye or Sovremenny
Mir?[3] We shall always have opponents of this kind and must be
triply cautious. Moreover, you also forgot about the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, who have for quite some

  Â  

time now been attacking the German Social-Democrats, making use of the
criticism of the syndicalists and distorting this criticism into
vituperation against Marxism.  

I donât know whether our people will now manage to put out your
pamphlet. Publishing has become difficult.  

Did you get my first volume?  

How are you getting on? Howâs the heir? I hear you had a good trip with
Gorky.  

Write and let us know what you are working on. We count on you both as
a contributor to Proletary and as a lecturer. You will not let us
down, will you?  

Where is Gorky? I wrote to him in Capri (Villa Blaesus). I wonder
whether it will reach him.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

published from AugustÂ 21 (SeptemberÂ 3), to NovemberÂ 28 (DecemberÂ 11), 1909,
and edited by Lenin.  

The first 20 issues were set up in type in Vyborg and printed from
matrices in St.Â Petersburg. For reasons of secrecy, the place of
publication was given as Moscow. Later, when it became extremely difficult
to put out a clandestine publication in Russia, the editors, in conformity
with a decision taken by the St.Â Petersburg and Moscow committees of the
R.S.D.L.P., moved the paper first to Geneva and then to Paris.

political parties and the trade unions gained the upper hand at the
Stuttgart Congress.

contributed to the journal. In 1914 it became the organ of the
social-chauvinists.

Dear An. Vas., 

Drop a line to let me know whether you have settled down and are work
fit. We are counting on you to write for Proletary
1) letters from Italy twice (roughly) a month, 8,000â12,000
characters. The first in about three weeksâ time.
2) Political feuilletons from time to time. Do you see the Russian papers
(Gorky gets a lot of them)?  

Write.

Dear Comrade, 

Camille Huysmans, Secretary of the International Socialist Bureau in
Brussels, has passed your inquiry on to me. As representative of the
Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party in the International Socialist
Bureau, I can inform you that the Estonian Social-Democrats (if I am not
mistaken, they call themselves the Union of Estonian Social-Democrats) are
part of our Party. There is indeed in Revel a Committee of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party consisting mostly of Estonians. As regards
citizens M.Â Jurisson and J.Â H. Seppin, these names are unknown to me. This
in no way militates against them; the organisations of our Party function
in secret and I know none of the Estonian comrades personally. I shall
write to the Central Committee of our Party in Russia and make inquiries
about these citizens (and, to make sure, also to the Revel Committee), but
we cannot expect a quick answer.  

With S.Â D. greetings,

 Vl.Â Ulyanov (N.Â Lenin)

I do not know a single Estonian Social-Democrat personally; it should not

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

I am told that the third volume of the reports of the various parties
to the Stuttgart International Socialist Congress is to come out in a few
days and that the report of our Party is not yet
      ready....[1]


Will it be possible to publish our Partyâs report in the third volume
or not? What is the time limit for submitting
it?[2]

The hounding in Finland has most likely prevent ed our comrades from
completing the report, for when I was in Finland two months ago I heard
myself that the Central Committee [had assigned the job] to a comrade,

  Â  

who was working energetically [to complete] the report.  

[Accept, dear] comrade, [my fraternal greetings].

Statement. Berner Tagwacht No.Â 24 (Thursday,
JanuaryÂ 30) carries a statement by L.Â Martov in regard to the case of
Dr.Â Semashko, a Russian comrade arrested in
Geneva.[2] In this statement Martov for some strange reason refers to
Semashko only as a journalist who had been present at the International
Socialist Congress in Stuttgart; at the same time he calls himself a
âdelegate of Russian Social-Democracy at the Stuttgart Congressâ.  

The Swiss workers will unquestionably interpret this statement of
Martovâs to mean that Semashko has nothing to do with the Russian
Social-Democratic Party.  

In order that Martovâs utterly inaccurate mode of expression should not
mislead anyone, I, as representative of the Russian Social-Democratic Party
in the International Socialist Bureau, hereby declare that Dr.Â Semashko is
an old member of our Party and that he was at the International Congress
both as a member of the Party and as a journalist working for the Party
press.  

I feel this explanation to be necessary inasmuch as our Swiss comrades
are clearly evincing considerable interest in Semashkoâs arrest. All the
Russian comrades who know him are firmly convinced that he is in no way
implicated in the Tiflis âexpropriationâ nor could he have been. And not
only because the last (London) Congress of our Party categorically rejected
this âmethod of struggleâ, but also because Dr.Â Semashko has lived
uninterruptedly since February

  Â  

1907 in Geneva, where he has engaged in literary activity.  

We are firmly convinced that the international Social-Democratic press
will very soon be able to welcome the release of the comrade arrested in
Geneva with the same justified joy as VorwÃ¤rts (in Berlin) and
lâHumanitÃ© (in Paris) at one time welcomed the release of the
comrades unjustly arrested in Paris.  

N.Â Lenin,

 Representative of the Russian Social-

 Democratic Labour Party

 in the International Socialist Bureau

[2]
The arrests in Geneva were connected with the changing of money
expropriated in Tiflis on JuneÂ 13, 1907. The organiser of the
expropriation, Kamo (Ter-Petrosyan), and all the participants in it managed
to escape. But the tsarist authorities informed the police abroad of the
serial numbers of the 500-ruble banknotes seized in the expropriation; in
December 1907, persons changing these banknotes were arrested
simultaneously in Berlin, Munich,

 Â  

Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Geneva. In November 1907, Kamo was
betrayed by the provocateur Y.Â A. Zhitomirsky and arrested in Berlin. The
Russian Government, having established Kamoâs identity, secured his
extradition as a criminal. During the search for the Tiflis expropriators,
arrests were made in the Russian Social-Democratic colonies in Berlin,
Paris, Munich, Geneva and Stockholm. Protests against the violation of the
right of asylum for political emigrants compelled the West-European police
to release the arrested shortly after.

27.II.Â 08 

Dear Anatoly Vasilyevich, 

I remind you again and again about Ferri. If you havenât sent it yet,
itâs too bad!  

Besides we would very much like to ask you to write an article about
the Paris
Commune[1] for Proletary No.Â 3 (23) (the anniversary
issue). Perhaps you have the new book by JaurÃ¨s and Dubreuilâalthough
these gentlemen could hardly give a correct appraisal of the
Commune. Marxâs letters to Kugelmann which we have frequently discussed
should of course be mentioned again and quoted for the edification of the
opportunists.  
 

The size of this anniversary articleâ15,000 characters
maximum. Deadline, next Wednesday (MarchÂ 4). Please reply at
once whether you will send it.  

Please send it!  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Proletary No.Â 24 was dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the
death of Karl Marx. A.Â V. Lunacharsky informed Lenin that he could not
write the article about the Paris Commune.

Dear Comrade, 

My friends write me from Brussels that I am expected there shortly for
the session of the International Socialist Bureau.  

I should be very much obliged if you could let me know whether this is
so or not. Could you [tell
 me][1]

exactly (or at any rate [approximately]), when the next session of the
Bureau is to take place. I shall soon have to go for a few weeks to Italy,
and therefore it is very important for me to know whether I will be needed
in Brussels.  

Accept, dear comrade, my fraternal greetings.  

Vl.Â Ulyanov

18.III.Â 08 

Dear Comrade, 

Yesterday Kon paid me a visit and showed me your telegram to him, and
complained angrily, irritably about its impermissibly sharp, âpoliceâ
tone, which he said he could least of all forgive you who are well versed
in the nuances of the German language. I believe I should give you an
account of this characteristic talk with Kon. I replied of course that I
did not know what the neue
       Wendung[1]

was, but that I was certain that you would not have sent such a telegram
without good reason, and that to accuse Alexinsky, and the more so
yourself, of wishing to
  entgegenarbeiten[2]

the investigation was more than
ludicrous.[5] 

Kon told meâin confidence (not from you, of course)âthat there is
serious evidence against Litvinov, that he, Kon knows Litvinov well and
would not wish to make life hell for him or to take steps that would have
very serious consequences for him; no, but that he, Kon, merely considers
it absolutely necessary to show Europe (and especially the German
Social-Democrats) that trial by the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
is not a fiction and that the Party can vindicate itself. âSurely a way
can be found to do this without making life hell for anyone!â Kon
exclaimed. I, of course, said that in my opinion this could be done and
that there was no need for him to worry. There would be a hearing under all
circumstances, the Party would see to that, so why worry? It would be a
scandal, said Kon, if Alexinsky were to prevent a hearing. Nonsense, I
said. Alexinsky does not want to prevent a hearing nor can
he. There already is a scandal, and it is the
Mensheviks who are making it: see the article âTime To Stopâ in
Golos Sotsial-Demokrata No.Â 1â2, I
said.[6] Kon hadnât read it!! Think of it: while the
investigation is still going on, while Litvinovâs lips are sealed,
while the documents of the

  Â  

investigation cannot yet be published, the newspaper pours out
abuse anonymously! Think of Litvinovâs position!! Yet this newspaper is
actually the organ of the Central Bureau
Abroad,[7] nourished by it. And these are the judges??! That is how I
explained Alexinskyâs behaviour to Kon. To avoid any misunderstanding and
false rumours I consider it necessary to pass this on to you. For however
surprised I was that Kon should have come to me, the fact remains
that he did. And I am afraid that as a representative of the
German party in the Central Bureau Abroad he might misquote me. I
do not think we can rely on this sort of a reporter to speak on
Russian affairs before the
       Vorstand[3]

of the German party. It is essential that you personally as a member of the
supreme collegium should speak with the Vorstand and without fail
translate them the article in No.Â 1â2 of Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata. Other wise such absurdities offensive to me as
Konâs coming to âcomplainâ to me that Alexinsky is working against the
hearing are bound to occur. There is a limit to every thing....  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 V.Â Ulyanov 

P.S. Be sure to reply at once as to whether you will permit
the
       article[4]

I sent you to be printed in Russian in Proletary (with the
reservation that it was written for Przegl&awhatthed
Socjaldemokratyczny) and when. We are frightfully
short of copy for Proletary, and I am impatiently awaiting
your
reply.[8] 

P.P.S. After coming to me, Kon saw Ryadovoi, and, I believe; hinted to
him that he had after all privately shown his friends the Mensheviks the
record which you forbade to be
shown.[9] What the devil is this!

A reference to the inquiry undertaken by the Party into the slanderous
accusations levelled by the Mensheviks against M.Â M. Litvinov in connection
with the changing abroad of banknotes seized in the Tiflis expropriation
organised by Kamo (see NoteÂ 127). Leon Tyszka was a member of the
investigation commission at the initial stage of the inquiry. Later the
investigation was conducted by the Central Bureau Abroad, but owing to the
indiscreet behaviour of Bureau members, the matter was taken out of its
hands by decision of the August 1908 plenary meeting of the C.C.,
R.S.D.L.P., and handed over to a special C.C. commission of five members,
one each from the Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and the national organisations.





[6]
An editorial article containing slanderous accusations against the
Bolsheviks in connection with the Tiflis expropriation.  

Golos Sotsial-Demokrata (Voice of the Social-Democrat)âa
Menshevik organ published abroad from February 1908 to December 1911, first
in Geneva, then in Paris. In May 1909 it finally crystallised as the
ideological centre of the liquidators.





[7]
Central Bureau Abroad, the centre of all R.S.D.L.P. promotion
groups abroad, was at the time in the hands of the Mensheviks. In August
1908 a plenary meeting of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., adopt ed a general decision
on the promotion groups and the functions and organisational status of the
Central Bureau Abroad. The Bureau consisted of 10Â members appointed by the
C.C. (including one C.C. member with veto right), and its activities were
confined to attending to the needs of the promotion groups abroad and
carrying out general Party assignments given it by the R.S.D.L.P. Central
Committee Bureau Abroad.

The article âThe Assessment of the Russian Revolutionâ was print ed

Przeglqd Socjaldemokratyczny (Social-Democratic Review)âa
journal published by the Polish Social-Democrats in Cracow in 1902â04 and
1908â10.

Evidently a reference to the record of M.Â M. Litvinovâs
testimony. Litvinov lodged a protest with the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., on
MarchÂ 10, 1908, against the banding of his testimony over to the Central
Bureau Abroad. Leon Tyszka, assuming that the C.C. would discuss the
protest, had warned F.Â Kon that the matter was to be kept confidential.

Talked yesterday to Tyszka, who will be at your place today. In our
opinion he does not know anything yet about the aggravation of our
philosophical differences and it would be very important (for our success
in the C.C.) that he should not know of it.  

Best regards,

Dear Sir, Mikhail Nikolayevich, 

I take the liberty of applying to you as former editor of the
History of
Russia.[1] The secretary told me recently about the various plans
concerning an article dealing with the history of factory
industry. Although we fully agreed on everything I should like to have your
opinion: is it all right for me to undertake it in view of
Tugan-Baranovskyâs refusal?  
 

Please write a few words in reply on receipt of this letter. Besides
the subject mentioned here, there are a great many more which our common
acquaintances would like to discuss with you. But I am not sure whether the
address may be used or whether it is all right to correspond. I am waiting
for detailed instructions on this score.  

Best regards,

 V.Â Ulyanov

Notes
 
 



[1]
The publishers of the Granat Brothersâ Encyclopaedia were interested at
the time in studies on Russian history. Lenin was invited to contribute in
the autumn of 1907, when one of the editors of the Encyclopaedia,
A.Â V. Trupchinsky, made a special trip to Finland to negotiate with
him. Lenin agreed to write the essay âThe Agrarian System in Russia
Towards the Close of the Nineteenth Centuryâ, which was published only in
1918 by the Zhizn i Znaniye Publishers under the title âThe Agrarian
Question in Russia Towards the Close of the Nineteenth Centuryâ.  

Trupchinsky also visited Lenin in Geneva, where he evidently asked him
to write an article on the history of factory industry. The article was
never written.

21, Tavistock Place, London W.C.  

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

Comrade Isetsky (Salomon, Rue Goppart 78, Bruxelles) has probably
informed you that three Russian comrades, members of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party, Sarah Ravich, Khojamiryan and Bogdasaryan,
arrested several months ago in
Munich,[2] are being kept in conditions
    extremely....[1]


...Â that they have gone on hunger strike (Hungerstreike in German, [I
donât know] what the equivalent is in French).  

Their lawyer, the German Socialist Bernheim, writes us that it is
absolutely essential to prove that the arrested people are members of the
Social-Democratic Party. I have sent him my official statement
certifying that the arrested

  Â  

persons are members of our Party. But he considers that my statement is not
enough and that it is necessary to have the fact confirmed by the
International Socialist Bureau.  

I hope, dear comrade, that you....  

...that the deposition testifying that the three arrested in Munich are
members of the Social-Democratic Labour Party is signed by a representative
or else the secretary of the International Socialist Bureau, and that the
signature is witnessed by a notary public. Comrade Isetsky (Salomon) will
forward the deposition to Geneva....  

Accept, dear comrade, my fraternal greetings.

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

Thank you for your letter of AugustÂ 31st. I was away for three days and
that is why I did not reply
earlier.[10]
(...)[1]

as for the report we have [now] arranged that matter.
(...)[2]


...Â [that the Central Committee of our Party was able to hold (after
several months] ârestâ in prisons) a plenary meeting. The member of the
Committee who started to write the report was also arrested; he was only
released two weeks ago. Now he is here too. We have decided that it is
[impos]sible to continue the preparation of the
report

  Â  

in Russia and [we have] entrusted this [task] to a comrade [in Geneva]
(...)[3]

... that the report will be finished in two months. I deeply regret, dear
comrade, that we caused you a good deal of trouble and inconvenience but
you cannot imagine what a large number of militants we have lost and to
what extent
(...)[4]


... the crisis of
       (...)[5]


... the Courrier
International
       (...)[6]


... I do not know any internationalist of the old guard in
Geneva. You have probably written to London and to the committees of the
Swiss socialist

about this matter: if the socialist newspapers in London, Geneva, Zurich,
etc. ... will print an announcement that the International Socialist =

26.X.Â 08 

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

The official proceedings of the conference of the Inter national
Socialist Bureau held on OctoberÂ 11, 1908, will probably be published. All
the socialist papers which carried a report on this meeting of the Bureau
(LeÂ Peuple[1] in Brussels, VorwÃ¤rts in Berlin,
Justice in London, lâHumanitÃ© in Paris, and so on) did
not quite understand, and in some cases even completely distorted, the
meaning of my amendment to the Kautsky resolution. Although I submitted the
text of my amendment to the Bureau, it does not figure anywhere. I
therefore fear that the same inaccuracies may be repeated in the official
report. Will you be so kind, dear comrade, as to see to it that the
original text of my amendment is printed in the official
proceedings. This text ought to be among your papers, for I remember very
well that I handed in to the Bureau the text I had written. In the event
that this text has been lost, I am enclosing an exact copy of my
amendment and a translation of it into French (hoping that if the
translation is poor you will be kind enough to correct it).  
 

I shall be very much obliged, dear comrade, if you will drop me a
couple of lines on this
question.[2] 

Please accept my fraternal greetings.  

N.Â Lenin 

Vl.Â Oulianoff.
 Rue des MaraÃ®chers, 61. GenÃ¨ve.  

Kautskyâs resolution (translation given in the Brussels Le
Peuple, OctoberÂ 12, 1908): 

âIn view of the previous decisions of international
congresses to admit all organisations which stand for proletarian class
struggle and recognise political struggle, 

âthe International Bureau declares that the British
Labour Party shall be admitted to international socialist congresses
inasmuch as, while it does not directly recognise proletarian class
struggle, it nevertheless wages it in practice, and, by virtue of its very
organisation, which is independent of the bourgeois parties, stands for
this struggle, and, consequently, shares the viewpoint of international
socialism.â  

Leninâs amendment: 

The last paragraph, beginning with the words âinasmuch as, while it
does not directly recogniseâ, etc., should be worded as follows: 

âinasmuch as this party represents the first step on the part of truly
proletarian organisations in Britain towards a conscious class policy and a
socialist workersâ partyâ.

1.XII.Â 08 

Dear Comrade, 

In reply to your query with Comrade Tyszkaâs telegram enclosed I regret
to inform you that I must refuse to pose the question as Comrade
Tyszka would wish, for I believe that such a presentation of the
question is absolutely in correct.  

The representative of our group in the Central Committee Bureau Abroad,
Comrade Victor, informed Comrade Tyszka that our group could not
agree to the appointment of both a Bolshevik and a Menshevik as
representatives of the

C.C.[1] 

Now Comrade Tyszka is appealing from Comrade Victor to me
personally: âif Lenin himself objects to Igor,â the
telegram says, âwe shall give up Igorâ!! This is tantamount to appealing
to me personally against a decision of our group.

  Â  

I shall not reply to this âifâ of Comrade Tyszkaâs. In my opinion,
Comrade Tyszka should himself withdraw his motion to appoint Igor.


With comradely greetings,

 N.Â Lenin

FebruaryÂ 25, 1909 

Dear Comrade, 

The tanners of Vilna have sent Comrade Marzeli abroad to
collect money for the strikers. Comrade Marzeli saw

  Â  

Comrade Legien, but Comrade Legien treated him with distrust because
Marzeli had no identification papers.  

I know Comrade Marzeli, and he asks that the International Bureau
inform Comrade Legien that Comrade Marzeli has really been authorised by
the tanners of Vilna and that the money collected for the strikers be sent
to the address Comrade Marzeli indicated to Comrade Legien.  

The tannersâ union of Vilna will send Comrade Legien in addition a
special authorisation. I am enclosing the stamp of this union.  

With best wishes,

 Yours,

In reference to the M.C.âs reply to the âOpen Letterâ on the âParty
schoolâ[1] signed NN, the Editorial Board of Proletary
(enlarged) expresses its full solidarity with the view of the M.C. that a
local organisation cannot and should not take the responsibility for any
such undertaking. Considering the character of the future school and the
range of its activities as planned by its sponsors, and its extreme
remoteness from the areas of local activity, effective supervision over
such a school could be exercised only by the Party centres.  

Further, the editors of Proletary consider it necessary to
amplify one of the statements contained in the âOpen Letterâ you have
received.  

Among other things it says that the matter of âsupplying the school
with literary and practical workersâ (teaching personnel) is âwell in
hand and proceeding successfullyâ; that âall the prominent Party
theoreticians, mainly Bolsheviks, will take partâ in the school.  
 

The addition that should be made to these statements is that both the
Editorial Board of Proletary and the theoreticians and practical
workers of our group who are members of the narrow and enlarged Editorial
Board and also of the C.C. of the Party, first learned of the said school
from the Moscow Committee, while having had no intimation of it up till now
from the organisers and the participants in the school. In the given
instance, the Editorial Board cannot but regard the course of isolated
action chosen by the organisers of this undertaking as inevitably stem ming
from deep ideological roots. Here it will suffice to call attention to the
open criticism by Proletary (see No.Â 42) of âgod-buildingâ and
other distortions of Marxism associated with it.  

In these organisational conditions and in view of the obvious
exceptionally close connection of the future school with elements preaching
âgod-buildingâ or supporting that preachment, the Editorial Board of
Proletary considers itself in duty bound to declare that it cannot
vouch for the character of the school being either Bolshevik or Marxist in
general.  

For all that the Editorial Board assumes that the legal right of the
projected school to exist within the frame work of the Party is at the
present time indisputable. The group should not involve itself in an
enterprise the Bolshevik and Marxist character of which is not ensured;
however, the Party as a whole in its present state, when in some of its
very important institutions (e.g., in the collegium of advisers to the Duma
group) there are even extreme opportunists of the type of Prokopovich or
Kuskova, cannot deny it the right to exist. The Editorial Board therefore
considers that the Bolsheviks in the C.C., to which the initiators should
apply for endorsement of the school project, should vote in favour of
endorsement.

23/IV.Â 09 

Dear Friend, 

Pokrovsky is staying with us. A philistine of the first water. âOf
course otzovism is stupid, of course itâs syndicalism, but for moral
considerations I and probably Stepanov too shall be for Maximov.â All
sorts of wicked people, donât you see, are bullying the crystal-pure
scoundrels! These âmoralâ philistines begin to show how âmoralâ they
are as soon as you start speaking in their presence about the historical
task of uniting the Marxist elements in the group to save the
group and the Social-Democratic Party!  

It was the opposition that invited this sorry moraliserâwe didnât
invite him, knowing that the general meeting was being
      postponed.[1]


The news from Lindov and Orlovsky is so far not encouraging: the former
is supposed to be ill, the latter can come only to Petersburg. But my
letters addressed direct to them have not yet been answered. We shall wait
for their reply.  

It looks as if Vlasov is now deciding the future: if he goes with the
stupids, the philistines and Machists, then, evidently, there will be a
split and a stubborn struggle. If he goes with us, then perhaps it
will be possible to con fine things to the dropping out of a
couple of philistines who are nil in the Party.  

That blackguard Nikitich has gone to the S.R.s with a lot of
gossip and made mischief! Just like those âmoralâ parasites: to go to
another party to complain and lie about one, s own. At the
âtrialâ the S.R.s, obviously informed by Nikitich, are behaving
insolently, they
say.[3] Weâll hold this against Nikitich, we wonât forget it!  

I know nothing about the âYuri-Nikitichâ
incident.[4] I thought you would be able to tell me about it. In my
opinion, you yourself right now ought to write to Yuri,

  Â  

      respective[2]
invite him to come to you, and obtain guarantees from him, or
better still have the remainder transferred to a safe place.  

Domov+Bogdanov+Marat are now pressing on the B.C. to set the date of the plenary meeting for the end
of May or the beginning of June. Actually it can only be held later.  

Take your cure seriously, obey the doctors in everything, so as to be a
little better by the time of the plenum at least. Please give up
the idea of running away from the sanatorium: we are terribly short of
people, and if you donât recover your health (and have no illusions, that
is not easy, it will require curing yourself seriously!), we may
go under.  

Try to start and keep up the most regular correspondence with
Lyubich: this is imperative for we may have to call him out in an
emergency. Be sure to arrange direct correspondence with him.


Best regards,

 N.Â Lenin

Party treasury. The incident may have been connected with delay in payment
of the debt.

...with regard to your proposal to convene the B.C. now, we consider it
necessary to state the following: 

1) A number of previous meetings of the B.C. have shown that of the
more or less important questions raised at these meetings there is a whole
group that is obviously connected with the questions of a more general
nature which the meeting of the enlarged B.C. is now being called to
settle. Deciding this group of questions before the general issue of

  Â  

the course the entire fundamental and practical policy of the B.C. as the
leading organ of the Bolshevik group should take, is under these
circumstances either impossible or in effect develops into a squabble and
heightens its elements. With the attitude to the decisions of the
B.C. which we observe on the part of the âoppositionâ, comradely
discussion is reduced to a series of sallies by these comrades against
individual members of the B.C., to unwarranted repetition of gossip and
slander.  

2) In view of this, the B.C., noting that some members of the B.C. have
embarked on the path of division, has already resolved to allow decisions
on urgent practical questions to be taken by means of a
questionnaire circulated among B.C. members before the plenary
meeting. We there fore see no need at present to convene a meeting of the
members of the B.C. now in Paris, all the more as the question of the date
of the enlarged meetingâthe immediate purpose of the proposed
meetingâcan only be settled by obtaining the opinions of all
members of the B.C., mainly of those now in Russia. Corresponding inquiries
have been sent to all of them and we are now awaiting the replies, of which
you will be informed by the secretary.  

The question of inviting representatives from the regions does not
require special discussion, since their presence is obligatory at enlarged
meetings of the B.C.  

Comrade N.âs statement concerning the date suitable for him would, of
course, have been given the most careful consideration even if he had
handed it in himself and not through three other members.  

With comradely greetings,

 Y.Â Kamenev

 Grigory
 Victor

29.IV.Â 09 

Dear Friend, 

I received your letter today. On no account leave the
sanatorium. On no account move to a hotel. You must improve your
health radically before the plenary meeting, and this cannot be
done except in the sanatorium. We here have found the struggle against this
stupid, petty, under hand, disgusting squabble utterly nerve-racking;
refused to go to the B.C. meeting (for things are becoming intolerable),
thus evoking triple hysterics on the part of Marat and Domov! No matter!
But we need you in perfect health by the time the meeting is due, and so
take your cure seriously and by no means leave the sanatorium.


I suppose everything is settled now with Y. through the trip, though
belated.  

Things in Russia are bad: the whole Urals organisation has
been arrested, the whole conference. Shchur has evidently been taken as
well: otherwise his silence is inexplicable. Of Vlasov there is no sign.


Have you read
Volsky?[1] Let me know your opinion, and if you donât need the book,
send it here.  

As regards Rosa I know nothing. Hadnât you better write to her direct?


Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

4/V.Â 09 

Dear Friend, 

I received your letter and I protest vehemently. Granted we made a
mistake with regard to Pokrovsky (I am prepared

  Â  

to admit it and to take the blame wholly upon my self, for it was I who
persuaded Grigory), but for you to leave because of that would be the
height of absurdity. The Pokrovsky affair cannot be helped now. Thereâs no
point in calling out Meshkovsky before Vlasov and the regional delegates
(Shchur is safe and he vouches that from Moscow no otzovist will get in,
Lyadov and
     Alexinsky...[1]

âheâs

on Capri at the present timeâwonât get in either. From Petrograd, they
say, there will be an anti-otzovist). Now the thing to do is to
wait for the B.C. plenary meeting. Otherwise the squabble will growâand
after all we have stopped it. There is no doubt that at a meeting
with Pokrovsky present Bogdanov would have produced a dozen new
grievances and involved Pokrovsky in them, now there has been only one. And
this was inevitable: donât exaggerate, please! The âresentmentâ of
Nikitich and Lyadov and Pokrovsky, yesterdayâs neutrals, is not accidental,
it is inevitable; the thing has been festering, and now the boil
is beginning to burst, and it is not always possible to keep oneâs temper
with this stinking squabble going on all around.  

But for you to go would be madness. We will endure it here for another
month, without making matters worse, you may rest assured. For you to wear
out your nerves (and Paris is extremely nerve-racking) before the
meeting would be the height of absurdity.  

I protest a thousand times; you must stay in the sanatorium
until the plenary meeting. To economise 200â300 francs is
foolish. If you stay in the sanatorium we shall have at least one
man at the plenary meeting with strong nerves, one man not involved in
petty squabbles (here you will be dragged in, even if you
were a Solomon). If you leave, you will augment the number of those with
frayed nerves, without benefit to the cause.  

I protest most vigorously: on no account leave, be sure to stay in the
sanatorium right until the plenary meeting.  

No news from Vlasov yet. Must be patient. There was a letter from
Lindov: he agrees in principle to come within one or two months. That will
be just right. Orlovsky hasnât

  Â  

replied. In exactly a month from now we shall all be assembled and then we
shall see. In the meantime get well properly and you, at least,
keep calm, for heavenâs sake.  


Received a letter today, dated AprilÂ 18, saying that my book is
ready.[2]

At last! The delay irritated me more than anything else. By April 25â26,
old style, they promise to deliver it here.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

[Dear
      Friend,Â ][1]


5/V.Â 09 

Marat arrived yesterday (wholly with the opposition), and also Vlasov
(with us). Vlasov promised to go to you in a few days. So, stay
where you are and on no account move, otherwise you may miss
him. Vlasov shares your sentiments: is with us in principle, but chides us
for being hasty, for Pokrovskyâs victory, etc. So you need not be
afraid: from now on Vlasov will be in charge, and we shanât commit a
single misdemeanour.  

Vlasov reproaches us with being unable to get along with people (here
he is right). So here too you have nothing to fear. From now on Vlasov will
smooth everything out nicely.  

Meshkovsky and the regional delegates are coming. So we shall get
everything done. [So] do not worry, see to
  Â  

your health seriously. Under no circumstances must you leave the
sanatorium.  

If you are not completely recovered in three weeksâ time (or
thereabouts, for one cannot tell exactly as yet) it will be a disaster for
us. Do not stint a few hundred francsâitâs absurd. Attend to your health
do a lot of walking, sleeping, eating [this is obligatory], for the [Party]
needs healthy property.  


The Paris group met today. The Geneva group announced its break with the
B.C. and urged the Paris one to follow suit. Marat spoke for Geneva, and
Vlasov opposed him. This is good: Geneva started the split and
Marat incited the group against the B.C. without the B.C.âs knowledge,
without raising the question in it.  

They start things themselves, and get themselves into a mess.  


All [the best]. See to your health, and donât worry!  

Yours,
 [Lenin]

Paris, MayÂ 26, 1909 

Dear Comrade, 

The press reports that the tsar is going on a trip and intends to visit
Sweden, Italy, Britain and
       France.[1]


The Swedish socialists have already found it necessary to take action
on this score, and our comrade Branting,

  Â  

on their behalf, has voiced in the Swedish parliamentâin the form of an
interpellation to the governmentâa strong protest permeated with the
spirit of international socialist solidarity.  

We are confident that our comrades in other countries share Brantingâs
view that the tsarâs visit cannot be regarded as an ordinary official
diplomatic act and will on their part protest as the circumstances demand.


It is important, however, to urge them to act without delay. Clearly,
the Russian section cannot do so directly. We also believe that the
Executive Committee and the Inter-Parliamentary Commission could take the
initiative and issue an appeal to affiliated parties and also to their
parliamentary groups pointing to the role played by Tsar NicholasÂ II in the
outrages committed by the regime, of which he is not only a representative,
but an active and criminal instigator.  

The attention of our comrades in the other sections should be
especially drawn to the brutality practised in the Russian political
prisons, where tens of thousands of our comrades are paying for their
striving for freedom and for having fought for the workersâ cause and
socialism. These facts were the subject of an interpellation made recently
by the Social-Democratic group in the Duma, and we are sending you a
translation of this
interpellation[2] and would ask you to take note of it in drawing up
your appeal and if necessary to forward it to the sections with the re
quest that they print it in the press.  

With fraternal greetings,

 N.Â Lenin
 I.Â Rubanovich

[2]
After receiving this letter, which was signed also by I.Â Rubanovich,
the representative of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party in the
International Socialist Bureau, the Bureau called on all socialist parties
to protest against the tsarâs projected visit to their countries, and if
the visit took place, to demonstrate the European workersâ attitude towards
it.  

The Socialist and Labour groups in the Swedish, British, French,
Italian and other parliaments introduced interpellations concerning the
visit of the tsar, and in Sweden, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and other
countries protest meetings and demonstrations were organised.

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

Please forgive me the delay in replying. A number of circumstances
prevented me from writing to you earlier.  

The translation of the Programme of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party which you sent me is, in my opinion, far from
perfect. However, my own knowledge of French is so inadequate that I cannot
venture to under take to correct the translation. Comrade Charles Rappoport
(of the journal
LeÂ Socialisme[1]) has kindly agreed to do this work. He will
edit the translation and I hope to be able to send it to you soon.  

As regards the meeting of the International Socialist Bureau, I vote
for November.  

My new address: Mr. Wl.Â Oulianoff

    4. Rue Marie Rose. 4.

    Paris (XIV).  

Accept, dear comrade, my most friendly greetings.

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

Allow me to recommend to you the bearer of this letter, Comrade
Bogdasaryan, a member of our Party. The relatives

  Â  

of this comrade, who has been released from prison, have refused to support
him, and he is unable to continue his studies at the University. He knows
French well, and I hope it will not be too much to ask you to find him some
intellectual work.  

Thanking you in advance.  

With fraternal greetings,

 N.Â Lenin

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

AugustÂ 26, 1909 

Your letter of AugustÂ 23 received, and I thank you very much for the
copy of the letter from Gertsik, which you forwarded to me.  

This gentleman has long pestered me with his letters; he has even
wished to speak to me, but, needless to say, I have refused, for there is a
ruling by a revolutionary tribunal consisting of representatives of all
parties according to which Mr.Â Gertsik cannot be a member of a
revolutionary party. This ruling has not been rescinded, and
Mr.Â Gertsik is definitely lying when he avoids mentioning the essential
point of that ruling in his letter to
you.[1] 

He wants the ruling revised? There he is perfectly within his
rights. But the gentleman cannot but know that there is a lawful and honest
way of going about it, and if he avoids taking this way, if he prefers to
turn to the I.S.B., this is further proof (it seems to me) of his
dishonesty.  

The lawful and honest way to ask for a re-examination would be to
address the request to the central committees

  Â  

of the parties whose representatives took part in the tribunal in
Geneva. Why doesnât Mr.Â Gertsik appeal to these committees? Why does he
cite the private opinion of Mr.Â Burtsev instead of applying to the
Central Committee of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party of which
Burtsev is a member? Why does he turn to the I.S.B. with insinuations
against the Bolsheviks, claiming that they are acting âdishonestlyâ,
instead of appealing to the Central Committee of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party? The Bolsheviks belong to this Party. They
have only five members in the Central Committee, which consists of fifteen
members.  

You can judge for yourself who it is that is acting dishonestly in this
matter.  

I never was a member of the Bolshevik group in Geneva which
investigated the Gertsik affair. If Mr.Â Gertsik feels that the members of
this investigating commission acted unlawfully, etc., it is his right (and
his duty) to appeal to the Central Committee of the Party.  

In my opinion, the International Socialist Bureau cannot accept
complaints and requests that have not been first examined by the central
committees of the parties affiliated with the International. I fully
realise that Mr.Â Gertsik, like any other citizen, has the right to complain
to the I.S.B. against a decision of the central committees of the
parties belonging to the International. But if he does not wish to turn to
the central committees of member parties of the International, he has no
right, in my opinion, to appeal to the I.S.B. either.  

I believe that the only answer the I.S.B. can give to Mr.Â Gertsik is
this: apply to the central committees of all the parties whose
representatives took part in the tribunal, that is, the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, the
Bund, and so on. If these committees give no answer or turn down
the re quest, only then can you turn to the I.S.B. with a request or
complaint against one or another decision, against one or another central
committee of a party affiliated with the International. This is my opinion,
of which, as a member of the I.S.B., as a Bolshevik, and as a member of the
Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, I am
informing you. (There is a special bureau of

  Â  

the Central Committee of the Social-Democratic Labour Party in Paris, and
Mr.Â Gertsik knows very well that he should have applied to this bureau. I
myself am not a member of this body.)  

I am very sorry, dear Huysmans, that I cannot be in Paris on AugustÂ 30
and 31, 1909, and therefore will not be able to discuss this matter with
you. I hope you will forgive me for tormenting you with the bad French of
this letter, which really has stretched out too long.  

I am now holidaying out of town (Mr. Wl.Â Oulianoff. Chez Mâme
Lecreux. Bombon, Seine-et-Marne). I shall return to Paris by
SeptemberÂ 15.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin

The inter-party hearing of the charges against B.Â Gertsik by
representatives of the Geneva groups of the R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks and
Mensheviks), the Band, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, representatives of
the Social-Democrats of Poland and Lithuania and the Zurich group, and
Latvian Social-Democracy, found Gertsik unworthy of membership in any
revolutionary

 Â  

organisation. The Geneva Bolshevik group found him to be a provocateur.

Dear L.Â B., 

I received both letters and the article. In my opinion the latter
should be shortened. I shall try to make the cuts, though I donât know how
successful they will be.  

I shall wait for the article on international solidarity of the
proletariat (I have a circular letter of the International Socialist Bureau
on the subject; I am not sending it, for it is already late). Let Grigory
know about it.  


What is this that the papers have been saying about Sokolov? It is of great
interest to me, for I was going to write about the elections in
St.Â Petersburg. I read in
Rech[1] that the Social-Democrats are nominating
Sokolov. Write in detail what âfablesâ you have read about, and send the
issues over.  
 

I read the reviews in Vozrozhdeniye and Sovremenny

Mir.[2] 


About returning to Paris Grigory writes that lie will arrive by
SeptemberÂ 4. I will not be back before SeptemberÂ 15. As regards your
question whether you should go, I can only say this: if you have had a
proper rest, it would be good to go, start a Proletary
club at once, deliver two lectures (popular ones) to workers on Potresovâs
liquidationism and another about the âLeftsâ to Bolsheviks, and then
arrange for a lecture tour to groups abroad in late September
(roughly). This you must do.  


It will be interesting to discuss the Mensheviks and Prokopovich and
Kuskova when we meet. It is necessary to hit as hard as possible at
Potresovâs liquidationism both in articles and lectures. We are a bit late
with this.  

All the best.  

P.S. People write from Russia that things are not so good
there. Davydov has been arrested. It will be necessary to push on here with
agitation abroad.

Dear Gr., 

I am sending you
VorwÃ¤rts[2] and Kamenevâs article. I believe it
must be printed and without delay, for we are terribly
late as it is with this article which is in all respects absolutely
necessary for Proletary. It will have to be divided into two
feuilletons. The first (pp.Â 1â33) I have marked off and edited. Perhaps
you will be able to shorten it a little more? I will try to cut it some
more in the proofs; send it immediately to the printers and have them send

  Â  

me the proofs at once. The article is an important one and we
should go over it as carefully as possible.  

It is a pity that Kamenev works carelessly. The subject is a most
rewarding one, but he rambles on and on, beating about the bush, unable to
get to the heart of the matter properly.  

Perhaps we should send the second half hack to him for rewriting from
this angle? I think it would be a good thing. Write him on behalf of us
both and ask him to write the second part over again
(saving the first variant as well), to revise it along the lines
indicatedâtell him that this would make it an excellent article,
etc.âand send him the second part. I have no great hopes that he will
redo it, but we must keep insisting.  

He also promised an editorial for Proletary shortly. We shall
see.  

I shall write the articles for Proletary and send them
straight to the
       printers[1]

since you want to be in Paris on SeptemberÂ 4.  

I do not intend to return before SeptemberÂ 15.  

There is no point in your keeping Kamenev in Arcachon. If he has had a
rest, let him return, and under all circumstances he must be sent out
to lecture.  

All the best,

 N.Â Lenin 

I shall not undertake to write about the Bund people.  But it is
necessary to hit at their No.Â 2. You should do it.  Weâll put out
a big, fighting issue. Write an article against
No.Â 2.[3] 
 

Notes
 

[1]
A reference to Leninâs articles for Proletary No.Â 47â48
entitled:
âThe Liquidators Exposedâ, âOn the Open Letter of the Executive
Committee of the Moscow Regional Committeeâ, âThe Election in
St.Â Petersburgâ, and an article in the supplement to the issue, âThe
Faction of Supporters of Otzovism and God-Buildingâ (see present edition,
Vol.Â 16, pp.Â 15â61.âEd.  
 



[2]
VorwÃ¤rts, the Central Organ of the German Social-Democrats,
carried daily in late July and in August 1909 articles and detailed reports
on they Barcelona uprising (beginning with No.Â 174, JulyÂ 29) and the
general strike in Sweden (beginning with No.Â 178, AugustÂ 2). Lenin sent the
issues to Zinoviev to be used as source material for articles in
Proletary.  

The article by L.Â B. Kamenev referred to was his âThe Liquidation of
the Hegemony of the Proletariat in the Menshevik History of the Russian
Revolution (How A.Â Potresov Liquidated G.Â Plekhanov and Iskra)â
reviewing the five-volume The Social Movement in Russia at the
Beginning of the Twentieth Century put out by the Mensheviks, edited
by L.Â Martov, P.Â Maslov and A.Â Potresov. The article was printed in
Proletary Nos.Â 47â48 and 49, SeptemberÂ 5 (18) and OctoberÂ 3 (16),
1909.





[3]
Probably a reference to the September 1909 issue (No.Â 2) of Golos
Bunda (Voice of the Bund), organ of the C.C. of the Bund, published
illegally in Russia. Proletary carried nothing on the subject. A
news item about Golos Bunda No.Â 2 appeared in
Sotsial-Demokrat No.Â 9, NovemberÂ 13 (OctoberÂ 31).

11.9.Â 09 

Dear Huysmans, 

I am very much surprised that Comrade Charles Rappoport, who promised
me that he would translate the Programme and Rules of our Party, has not
written to you. He promised to do so several weeks ago.  

I shall be in Paris in two or three days and shall ask him about it at
once and let you know.  

As regards the affair concerning Mr.Â Gertsik, it is a very good thing
that you have retracted the more than unfair accusation against our Party.


You ask for the address of the comrade âto whom Gertsik should
applyâ. I repeat: he must apply to the commit tees of the parties
whose representatives participated in the hearing of the Gertsik case. The
address of the Bureau Abroad of the Central Committee of the Russian
Social. Democratic Labour Party is the following: Mr. D.Â Kotlyarenko (for
the Bureau, etc.), 110. Rue dâOrleans 110. Paris.  XIV. This address is
regularly given in our papers. I also wish to say again that I shall never
reply to Gertsik since the scoundrel allows himself to level extremely
insulting insinuations at the Russian Social-Democrats. It is as simple as
this. If he has the temerity to say that the Russian Social-Democrats are
âbiasedâ judges, why does he not apply to the committees of the other
parties that passed judgement on him?  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin 

Wl.Â Oulianoff
 4. Rue Marie Rose. 4

 Paris. XIV.

Dear Mark, 

Being busy with an article yesterday I overlooked by mistake in
Grigoryâs draft (reply to the Capri group on behalf of the
 E.C.[1]

)

the point about inviting a representative. This nonsense must
absolutely be deleted; it is students that should be invited to
Paris to study, not a representative. Some rabid otzovist, and even Lyadov
or Alexinsky, might be elected representative, in which case we would find
ourselves the dupes. No, there can be no question of inviting a
representative.[3] 

I still havenât got Plekhanovâs Dnevnik. I earnestly ask you
to arrange for the forwarding office to send it to me at once. Without it I
cannot do an article I have been asked to

       write.[2]


All the best,

 N.Â Lenin 

We sent you a cheque yesterday by registered mail. I trust you have
received it.

In view of the circulation among Social-Democratic groups abroad of a
printed leaflet signed âSashaâ (the leaflet is enclosed) containing
charges against the Editorial Board

  Â  

of Proletary,[1] and, further, in view of the fact that some
of the opponents of Proletary from among both the Bolsheviks
âremovedâ after the recent conference and the Mensheviks are using this
leaflet to involve the groups in a discussion of a âsensational affairâ
which in no way comes within the competence of any local Party groups or is
subject to examination by them, the Editorial Board of Proletary
requests the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. to investigate the charges made by
âSashaâ, to examine the substance of these charges and to hand down an
official decision of the Partyâs highest body.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This letter was written in connection with the circulation abroad by
some otzovists of a leaflet alleging that the Bolshevik Centre had declined
to render assistance to persons suspected of being involved in an
expropriation in the Urals.  

In the Supplement to Proletary No.Â 47â48 the editors refuted

 Â  

the allegation and announced that the Editorial Board of Proletary
had asked the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., to investigate the matter.

17.9.Â 09 

My dear Huysmans, 

I received your letter of SeptemberÂ 15, 1909, on my arrival in Paris. I
have seen the secretary of the Bureau of our Committee. He informed me that
he had recently received a letter from Gertsik and the Bund committee
showing that Gertsik had at last applied to the committees of the other
parties, which he should have done earlier. The Bund is for reviewing the
case. The Bureau of the Central Committee of our Party will examine the
request for a revision. This, I hope, closes the âGertsik incidentâ.


As regards Rappoport, he asks you to let him know the exact
date when you absolutely must have the translation of the Programme
and Rules. Kindly write what the final date is either to me or to
Rappoport, 39Â Boulevard Port Royal, 39. Paris. XIII.  

Comrade Rappoport says that his position as a literary proletarian
compels him to ask to be paid for the translation, at your discretion. He
definitely promised me that

  Â  

he would have the translation ready by the date you set.  

As for the historical survey, I have found a Russian comrade who will
do it in a few days.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

Just got back to our capital here and read your letter on how things
are coming along. As regards the school, you are mistaken if you think âwe
are in a bad wayâ. Nothing of the kind. That workers, once they are given
the money, should agree to go down to the glorious South is naturalâthere
is nothing to complain about in this. Only it is necessary to have
resolutions adopted that on the way back these workers are to come
 here[1]

for a monthâthis is the crux of the matter. Unless they drop in here all
talk about âsupervisionâ, âdirectionâ, etc., is sheer
     âblagueâ[2]

or hypocrisy. To come here means to learn something more than Alexinskyâs
whining and Lunacharskyâs âsocialismâ. And believe me, this
    way[3]

âby

bamboozling 20â50 workers with their learningâthey will not get
very far. Oh no, itâs good enough for making a noise, for bragging about

  Â  

Kautskyâs
letter,[4] for putting on a show abroad, but there is nothing serious
about this underhand indoctrination. Make no mistake, this is not a
âschoolâ, but a new Yerogin
hostel[5] abroad for surreptitiously filling the heads of dozens of
workers with otzovist nonsense. Maximov and Co. will merely make a noise
for a while and end up with a fiasco.  

The Trotsky business, regrettably, will not work out. We offered him
ideal conditions, sincerely wishing to enter into a bloc with him:
a salary, payment of the Pravda deficit, equal rights on the
Editorial Board, transfer here; he does not agree, but wants a
majority on the Editorial Board (two Trotskyites and one
Bolshevik!). Clearly we cannot maintain in another city a Trotskyite, not a
Party, paper. What Trotsky wants is not to build the Party together with
the Bolsheviks, but to create his own faction. Very well, let him
try! By means of âhisâ faction he will win over some people from the
Mensheviks, a few from us, and in the long run will inevitably lead the
workers to Bolshevism.  

As for the âslight revision of the agrarian questionâ, as you
ironically put it, in the given case, if it is a matter of the role of the
peasantry in the revolution, it is necessary to be more cautious. The
beginning should be made with a discussion in the general Party or
general Bolshevik press. I especially wish to warn against hasty rejection
of Bolshevism and exaggerated faith in the success of the Stolypin agrarian
policy. It unquestionably posed new problems which must be studied and
studied again; it opened the possibility of a
non-revolutionary way out, but this is still as remote from complete
success as the stars in the heavens.

(OctoberÂ 3), 1909. Kautsky declined to lecture but welcomed the
organisation of the school. Observing that âit would he gratifying if the
R.S.D. could at last overcome factional division which weakens it so
muchâ, Kautsky urged that philosophical differences should not be brought
to the fore in either propaganda or the organisational sphere.

30/9.Â 09 

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

I am sending you today the translation of the Programme and Rules of
our Party (by registered book-post). Be so kind as to send me the
proof-sheets.  

As for the survey, I shall send it to you in a few days.  

I have made arrangements for payment to the translator (Rappoport). The
expense will be defrayed by our Central Committee.  

This is the first time I hear that there is a representative of the
parliamentary group in the Bureau. There has been one meeting of the Bureau
since Stuttgart and I heard no mention there of any representative of the
parliamentary group being in the Bureau. On receipt of your letter I at
once wrote to a representative of the Social-Democratic group in the Third
Duma and informed him of this. We cannot expect an answer soon since the
deputies are not in St.Â Petersburg between Duma sessions.  

As regards our Partyâs report to the Copenhagen Congress, I shall do
everything I can to see that we are not left without one this time. I have
already taken the necessary steps. As for the David plan, I think it is no
more than a matter of âgood
    intentionsâ.[1]

Has the Bureau approved the plan? Does the âsingle modelâ exist
as a reality and not as a project?  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin

Dear Mark, 

There is indeed beginning to be quite a to-do over the school and you
are right when you say that we must give thorough thought to the
reply.[1]

I am offering a draft and in the event that it takes time to contact all
members of the E.C. (Executive Commission of the Bolshevik Centre)âthis I
believe should be done through one person, i.e., through youâI would
advise the secretary of the B.C. to reply to the âSchool Councilâ that
the letter has been received and forwarded to the members of the
Executive Commission and it will take some time before they can answer and
take a decision, since they are all away. The reply, however, should be
rather caustic: to the effect that I am aware that Gr., Inok and Lenin have
already replied on their own behalf to the Executive Commission of
the school, hut that the School Council will have to be answered
by the entire collegium.  

I have a request to make of you. Send me a letter to the Editorial
Board of Proletary signed Mark or any other pseudonym of
yours. Contents approximately as follows:
âIn view of Comrade Domovâs statement in the press accusing the Editorial
Board of Proletary of splitting activities, of not putting out
popular pamphlets, of betraying Bolshevism, of drawing closer to Plekhanov,
of âDumaismâ, and so on and so forth, I deem it advisable to acquaint Party
comrades with Comrade Domovâs present views. In the presence of
Comrades Maximov and Lyadov and myself he said: âThere are now two
pernicious misconceptions: firstâthat we have a party, and second, that a
revolution is imminent in Russia.â I made this public in a lecture to Paris
Bolsheviks in the presence of Comrade Maximov, who could not deny the
fact. The comrades should know who it is that is now campaigning against
Proletary.â[2] 
 

It is indeed high time to expose this crew! Weâll print your letter and
answer them properly.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

critique of the leaflet was given by Lenin in his article âThe Faction of
Supporters of Otzovism and God-Buildingâ (see present edition, Vol.Â 16,

I suggest the following answer: 

âDear Comrades, 

âIn view of the obviously insulting nature of your letter of
SeptemberÂ 28, 1909, in reply to our proposal âto entrust the actual
organisation and guidance of a propagandistsâ school abroad to the
Central Committee of the Party or the enlarged Editorial Board of
Proletaryâ, we do not consider it necessary to reply to it and can
only suggest one thing: publish your
letter.â[1] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The letter sent to the Council of the Capri school read as follows: =

âDear Comrades! Of the two prospects noted in our letter to you the second
has materialised: you do not wish to carry out the decisions of the local
organisations but propose to negotiate with the Bolshevik organ only as a
separate exclusive group. You know full well that by taking this stand you
yourselves are impeding further talks. We can give you only one advice:
publish your last letter to us.â  

However, the School Council published its letter only after the end of
the course in âReport of the First Higher Social-Democratic Propaganda and
Agitation School for Workersâ in Paris late in 1909.

Dear K., 

Please let us know what you have decided to do with the
library.[1] Is it true that the talks with the studentsâ society are
not yet over?  

Or is it true that you have finally decided not to go?  
 

Was it Victor who dissuaded you? I am a little angry with him for going
away alone, depriving us here of the assistance of a most useful
administrator, which I consider him to be. He is now âfor Genevaâ. I
believe this is a mistake: we shall not go to Geneva.  


Do you have a catalogue of the Bolshevik (Bonch)
library?[2] If so, kindly send it to us.  


I am awaiting more definite news about your moving. There is talk here in
the Editorial Board about transfer ring only the Bonch library. We must
know definitely, and as soon as possible.  

Regards to Olga, Nik.Â Iv. and other friends.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Proletarian Library collected by the Social-Democrat G.Â A. Kuklin, who
sided with the Bolsheviks in 1905, and presented by him to the C.C.,
R.S.D.L.P., in July 1905. A Statement by Kuklin announcing that the library
was now the full property of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., was published in
Proletary No.Â 7, JulyÂ 10 (JuneÂ 27), 1905.  

In his reply of OctoberÂ 18, 1909, V.Â A. Karpinsky, who was in charge of
the library, agreed to the transfer to Paris on condition

 Â  

that the library remained independent and would not function under the
auspices of the Editorial Board of the Central Organ,
Sotsial-Demokrat, but would merge with one of the existing
libraries in Paris.

In order to conduct our business affairs systematically and to
be able just as systematically to cut down expenses, it is necessary 

1) to draw up monthly accounts under comparable headings
separating the most essential items least subject to change from
the more incidental and more easily reducible items (publishing the paper
from aid; premises of the for warding office and print-shop expenses from
the cost of paper, typesettersâ wages, etc.); 

2) to try to draw up a rational summary account for a
considerable period of time (e.g., half a year) indicating average
expenditure on each item. (Allowances to Party workers separately; aid
separately; incidental and travelling expenses should not be lumped
together; expenditure on the newspaper itemised:
typesettersâpaperâpremisesâforwarderâs

  Â  

wagesâprinting shop, etc.) After that it is necessary to consider
carefully cuts on each item, not approximately, not by rule of thumb, but
on the basis of exact estimates (re duce such-and-such an item by so-and-so
much: buy cheaper paper or rent cheaper premises, etc., etc.; reduce
expenses on âmessengersâ and travel, etc.).

Dear Comrade, 

Please print in the next issue of the C.O. my resolution rejected by
two votes against two with one abstention and my notice of resignation from
the Editorial Board of the

  Â  

C.O.,[1] and also send me Copies of my resolution, Martovâs and the one
adopted, with the results of the voting.  

With S.D. greetings,

 N.Â Lenin 

Paris, NovemberÂ 4, 4909 

P.S. I would also ask the Editorial Board of the C.O. to let me know
whether it will accept for publication in the next issue my discussion
article on the methods of consolidating our Party and its unity.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The background of this letter is as follows: The Editorial Board of
Sotsial-Demokrat refused to print Leninâs article âOn Methods of
Consolidating Our Party and Its Unityâ as an editorial and suggested that
he submit it as a signed article. In reply Lenin submitted the question of
methods of consolidating the Party and its unity for discussion by the
Editorial Board and proposed a draft resolution on it (see present edition,
Vol.Â 16, p.Â 77). Lenin and Kamenev voted for the resolution, Martov and
Warski ware against, and Zinoviev, who in general objected to the adoption
of a political resolution on this question, abstained. Since the article
and the resolution were rejected, Lenin submitted his resignation from the
Editorial Board of the C.O.  

The Executive Committee of the Bolshevik Centre drew up a collective
statement to the Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat from the
Bolshevik members of the Board and the representative of the Polish
Social-Democrats to the effect that the âincidentâ, being based on a
misunderstanding, should be considered closed (see Collected
Works, Fifth [Russian] Ed., Vol.Â 47, p.Â 287).

22/I.Â 1910 

Dear Sir, 

I am very well aware of the scientific character of the dictionary and
would gladly give you all the information you wish concerning the history
of Social-Democracy in Russia. But at the moment, unfortunately, I could
not possibly write a brief essay on the history of
Social-Democracy.[2] 

There is some good information up to 1904 in the report to the
Amsterdam International Congress of 1904âLidin, [M.] Explanatory
Material Bearing on the Crisis in Russian Social-Democracy (Geneva)
[1904] and several articles by different authors in Neue Zeit.


In August 1910 an international congress will be held in
Copenhagen. Presumably the official report of our Party (Social-Democratic
Labour Party of Russia) will appear within a few months.  

There have been two major trends in the S.D. movement in
1903â09ââMensheviksâ and âBolsheviksâ. In Neue Zeit you
will find articles by representatives of both trends.  

Bibliography: Cherevanin (Menshevik), reviews in VorwÃ¤rts
and Leipziger
Volkszeitung.[3] Trotsky, middle position (Vermittlerstellung)
(Russland in Revolution, 1910).  

I myself belong to the âBolshevikâ trend.  

[There are] articles by Trotsky in German also in Kampf
(Austrian S.D.
review).[4] 
 

Please excuse me for not being able to give you a systematic essay.


Respectfully yours,

 Vl.Â Ulyanov

On behalf of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, on behalf of
all the workers of Russia who are waging a bitter struggle against
oppression by tsarism and the bourgeoisie joined in counter-revolution, we
send you, vanguard fighter of international and leader of German
Social-Democracy, hearty greetings on the occasion of your 70th birthday.


You began your activity in the working-class movement almost half a
century ago as a young turner, first a patriot, then a democrat who worked
devotedly in workersâ educational societiesâand the path you have
traversed reflects the stride forward which the entire international
proletariat has made in that period. At the beginning of that period most
class-conscious workers either followed the bourgeois parties or at best
sought their own class road to socialism by switching from one socialist or
anarchist sect to another. Now the vast majority of class-conscious workers
in the civilised world are Social-Democrats, and it is precisely in Germany
that the theoretical principles of Marxism have taken deepest root and
spread most widely among the masses of the proletariat, illumining with
radiant light their struggle for the complete overthrow of capitalism.

 

In your person we honour a working-class leader who has shown by his
example that the emancipation of the workers must be accomplished by the
workers themselves. Drawing on the theory of Marxism, the German
class-conscious workers, more than the workers of other countries, have
been able to safeguard their movement against the mistakes of opportunism
and anarchism, they have succeeded in building up powerful mass trade union
and political organisations and uniting in a single class force. And at all
crucial moments in historyâwhen waves of national chauvinism rose high,
or when rampant feudal-monarchist and clerical reaction declared a war of
annihilation on socialist organisationsâthis class force was able to find
the right road, to uphold its revolutionary world outlook, its confidence
in the inevitability of the coming great socialist revolution, and carry it
ever more broadly and deeply into the masses.  

In the half-century of your activity the workers of Russia see a
guarantee that in the coming decisive battle, the dawn of which is clearly
visible in Germany and other advanced countries, the Social-Democratic
proletariat will not only fight with the same selfless energy and faith in
its strength with which it won many a victory in the epoch of bourgeois
revolutions, but will be able also to win and to smash for ever the entire
edifice of capitalist exploitation.

23/II.Â 10 

Dear Comrade, 

I have read your letter. I recall our joint work in London. I recall
that at that time (or a little later) I heard with one ear about the
commission on your
case.[1] 

That such an affair should drag out for nearly three years is in my
opinion really outrageous, and I quite appreciate your indignation. What is
to be done?  As far as I can judge, it is necessary to apply officially to
the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. and specifically to its organ abroad,
the Bureau Abroad of the C.C. (address the same; insideâfor the
Bureau Abroad of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P.). I think the best thing
would be for me to forward your letter to them. If you agree, I can do it.


If you would like first to try to push the matter through members of
the Chief Executive, you had best apply to Yuzef (for you do not suspect
him of any partiality). And that should be done at
once. Send him a letter (by registered post) addressed both
to the Chief Executive and to the Polish Social-Democrat member of the
Editorial Board of the Central Organ (also care of Kotlyarenko; inside:
for member of the Editorial Board of the C.O. from the P.S.D.). If
this is done quickly, I believe you ought to be able to get an
answer and advice from Yuzef.  

The permanent organ abroad of the C.C., i.e., the C.C. Bureau Abroad,
can (and should) put an end to the affair. The Russian C.C. would in my
view be physically unable to do so. How the Polish Chief Executive could
have dragged it out so long and disobeyed its own Congress is more than I
can understand!  

With S.D. greetings,

 N.Â Lenin

[1]

A.Â Ekk (Mukhin) was accused of unseemly behaviour. The case was
examined in 1909 by a special commission which found that there was âno
grounds for bringing Ekk before a Party courtâ. Ekk was not informed of
this decision; in reply to an inquiry ad dressed to F.Â E. Dzerzhinsky
(Yuzef), he received an answer dated MarchÂ 9, 1910, that the C.C. of the
Party had âendorsed the decision of the commission as it stoodâ. Later,
however, the

 Â  

Ekk case was reopened; the last commission was unable to complete the
investigation in view of the outbreak of the First World War.

21.III.Â 10 

Dear L.Â B., 

The article about Koltsov received, read and passed
on...[1]

;

I liked it very much, I think it turned out quite
well[2]..., no doubt it will cause a grand row? but there is a
constant row there as it is!! The composition of the C.O. has
deteriorated[3]âa year before the plenum not a single
row. Now not a single issue [withoutÂ ] some document of protest,
threats and hysterics from Martov....  

[How do matters standÂ ] with the report?  

Donât give me away, for the love of Christ!  

I am again being âharriedââthat is to say, remindedâby the
International Bureau. Write, write that [reportÂ ] as quickly as possible
[for the sakeÂ ] of all thatâs holy.... As soon as the report is ready we
shall [tackleÂ ] a legal Bolshevik
[journal].[4] 

With best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. Rather scurvy behaviour of Trotskyâs in No.Â 10 of
Pravda,[5] I must say!

The Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat, the Central Organ of
the R.S.D.L.P., consisted, as decided by the January 1910 plenary meeting
of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., of 2Â Bolsheviks, 2Â Mensheviks, and one
representative of the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania. Its
composition was as follows: from the Bolsheviks, Lenin and G.Â Y. Zinoviev;
from the Mensheviks, Y.Â 0. Martov and F.Â I. Dan, and from the Polish
Social-Democrats, A.Â Warski. When Martov and Dan found themselves in the
minority on one or another question, they created conflicts and complained
to the Central Committee Bureau Abroad about the Bolsheviks and the
representative of Polish Social-Democracy. The C.C. Bureau Abroad addressed
an inquiry to the C.C. concerning the âextent of the jurisdiction of the
C.C. Bureau Abroad in matters relating to conflicts arising in the
Editorial Board of the Central Organâ. The Bolsheviks proposed to the
C.C. that a plenary meeting of the C.C. be called to replace Martov and Dan
in the Editorial Board of the Central Organ with pro-Party Mensheviks (see
present edition, Vol.Â 16, pp.Â 191â94).

Dear Comrades, 

Our inquiry as to how you understand your competence in
matters concerning conflicts in the Central Organ has

  Â  

not yet been answered. Nevertheless we consider it necessary to offer you
some explanation with regard to a number of conflicts that have occurred in
the new Editorial Board of the C.0. since the plenumâas we propose to do
in the near future for the information of the whole Party and
all Social-Democrats.  

We shall begin with the last statement of Comrades Dan and Martov of
MarchÂ 29.  

1. It is not true that we decided to publish the article from Tiflis
âcontaining violent attacks on the Caucasian Regional Committeeâ, for it
had been decided to omit that section of the article and leave only the
polemics on points of principle with the Georgian newspaper which the
author, a local functionary, charges with liquidationism. The authors of
the statement, moreover, conceal from you the fact that the manuscript of
this polemical article was sent to the author of the Georgian article in
order to give him an opportunity to reply in the same issue of the
C.0. (Later on, at the last meeting of the Editorial Board, we decided to
turn over the whole polemic together with the reply to Diskussionny
     Listok.[1]

)



2. The authors of the statement conceal from you why we rejected
Comrade Danâs article on the tasks of the Party with regard to the
persecution of the trade unions. We rejected it because the âtasks of the
Party in this article are reduced to exchanging the struggle to overthrow
the autocracy for the petty cash of Cadet âstruggle for
legalityââ.  

3. Comrades Dan and Martov consider it âunnaturalâ for us to have
conferred separately on how to rebuff the base attacks on the C.0. and on
the unity of the Party, while considering it âperfectly naturalâ that
they them selves, two editors of the C.0., should have met with other
editors of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata in order to launch a
foul attack on the
C.O.[5] A conference of like-minded people within a collegium and joint
discussion of an article

  Â  

before laying it on the editorial desk for final judgement (moreover, in a
case such as the given one), they consider to be a violation of the
law. But to be a member of the Editorial Board of the C.O., entrusted by
the C.C., among other things, with the task of âexplaining the danger of
deviationsâ towards liquidationism . and
otzovism, and at the same time a member of the Editorial Board of Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata, which shields, encourages and defends
liquidationism and with regard to which the C.C. has spoken of the need to
terminate its existenceâthis they do not consider incompatible
with political integrity. This habit of stabbing the Central Organ and
Party unity in the back while at the same time demanding âcollegialityâ
in drafting a reply to the back-stabbing they themselves have dealt, a
habit characteristic of underground manipulators, we leave to the authors
of the statement. To discuss with them their own attacks against the
Central Organ would have been an undignified farce on our part. The only
thing We could do was to lay the article on the editorial desk in order to
give them a chance to acquaint themselves with its contents and to hear
their objections. That is what was done.  

4. The authors of the statement write that we âdirectly deceivedâ
them, for âno mention was made of any intention to publishâand with
shocking distortion of the truth to bootâpart of the correspondence
between members of the C.C. and the C.C. Bureau Abroadâ. Not only did we
not mention this to them, we made no mention of the contents of the article
in general, for the simple reason that we gave the article to
them. Comrade Dan actually looked through the manuscript. This is
indeed deception on the part of Dan and Martov, who expected that you would
not notice that a few lines earlier they write that we gave theta the
article to read in the manuscript, in other words, had no intention to
conceal anything from them. In order to show what our âshocking distortion
of the truthâ consists in, we are printing in No.Â 12 of the Central Organ
all relevant excerpts from the C.C. letter. The reader will be
able to judge for himself.  

5. The authors of the statement write about the âsecrecy aspect of the
matterâ. But they forget to tell you that we

  Â  

did not disclose in the press the place occupied in the Party
organisation by the three liquidators, that Dan and Martov themselves
published not only their names but also those of other liquidators in
Nos. 19â20 of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata. As for us, we can only
reply to this in the words of Plekhanov that the only thing that
âthreatensâ liquidators of the Party is âan order of merit round the
neckâ.  

6. The authors of the statement write that Bolsheviks too refuse to go
into the
 C.C.[2]

But they deliberately forget to tell you that it is not a matter of who
wants or does not want to enter the C.C. but of who considers the C.C. and
the Party unnecessary and harmful.  

7. The authors of the statement complain that their articles have been
rejected. But all these complaints have only one object: artificially to
create the grounds for the existence of Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata. For this reason the authors of the statement are
boycotting âDiskussionny Listokâ, in which their
articles could be freely printed. They are deliberately wrecking this Party
publication, too, whose purpose it is to obviate the need for factional
organs, to enable all trends in the Party freely to express themselves
whenever their views differ from those of the Central Organ. For example,
we suggested that Comrade Martovâs article âOn the Right Pathâ be printed
either in the Central Organ with an editorial comment
(since the article challenges C.C. decisions) or in Diskussionny
Listok. The first of these alternatives was called giving the article
a âgendarmeâ escort, and the second, âexilingâ it. And we were
literally told: ânow we shall open hostilities against you.â  
 

8. The authors of the statement complain that we print ed an article
about the conference which they allege âcompletely distorts the decisions
of the plenary meeting on this questionâ. What lies behind this complaint
is this:
the article in question wholly agrees with the C.C. letter on the
conference,[6] and the anti-liquidationist letter of the C.C. about the
conference is not to the taste of the extreme liquidator Dan. The article
was written by the comrade who wrote the C.C. letter. And Comrade Martov
signed the C.C. letter. It was adopted unanimously. When
he sent the proofs to the author of the letter, Comrade Martov wrote:
âI have no objections to your text of the letter about the
conference.â  But now, before the liquidationist cock has had time to crow
thrice, L.Â Martov hastens (together with Dan) to disavow the letter he
himself accepted. The statement ofÂ ... written by Dan and signed also
by Martov naÃ¯vely reveals the real cause of the dissatisfaction of the
Golos people with the C.C. letter on the conference and with our
article on the same subject: the plenary meeting, it appears, allegedly
decided to âreconcileâ the Party with the âso-called liquidationismâ
and to âfill in the gulfâ between the liquidators and the Party. But the
Central Organ is not carrying out this task. We confess that we are doing
the exact opposite. What is surprising is only this: why did the authors of
the statement complaining about the rejection of articles themselves
reject in Golos Sotsial-Demokrata an article signed among
others by Comrade Martov, namely, the âLetter of the C.C.â concerning the
conference? Why did they not reprint it either in full or at least in
part? Probably because the C.C. letter âcompletely distorts the
decisionsâ of the Central Committee.  

9. The authors of the statement have the audacity to turn to you, the
Central Committee Bureau Abroad, with a demand for
âsatisfactionâ for the unpleasantness caused them by the exposure of the
three practical liquidators. They evidently believe that you might agree
not to bring into the light of day the monstrous outrage against our Party
committed by their associates Mikhail, Roman and Yuri. They evidently
ascribe to you the intention of concealing from the Party the
conspiracy against the Party

  Â  

which we exposed and which a member of the C.C. in his letter from
Russia asked you to make public. We of course leave it to you to give
an appropriate reply to such an insult to your Party conscience. We on our
part believe that no Party body will venture to side with the Romans,
Yuris, Mikhails and their accomplices to any extent or in any way, not even
indirectly. Such individuals and bodies should be pilloried without
delay and openly in the name of the entire Party. We in the
Central Organ of our Party, where we have been placed by the will of the
plenum, shall unswervingly pursue this line. The same fate will
befall anyone who throws in his lot with those who would destroy the
Partyâwhoever he may be.  

10. The authors end their statement by threatening you that if you do
not do as they wish they will set about exposing cases that were closed by
the plenary meeting of the C.C. And this they promise to do despite the
C.C. decision. But this threat is no longer an instance of the usual
fraktioneller
Dreck,[3]

as the representative of Latvian Social-Democracy put it at the plenary
meeting of the C.C. referring to the way the Golos people had
seized on these issues for the sake of factional muck; it is downright
factional blackmail with regard to the C.C. Bureau Abroad. And, of
course, we leave it to you, comrades, to deal worthily with these
blackmailers operating with factional muck.  

But we refuse to go into all the falsifications, distortions of facts
and downright lies amassed against us in the statements, complaints and
protests of Martov and Dan. You yourselves, comrades, will unquestionably
be able to get to the bottom of all this factional muck, although we do not
doubt that it will evoke in you the same natural feeling of revulsion it
has aroused in us. Nevertheless we would like in conclusion to draw your
attention to two things.  

First. We should like to remind you that the present attempt
of the Golos people to disrupt the C.C. is not the
first. As far back as the summer of 1908, when the Bolshevik members
of the C.C. were arrested, the Golos people made

  Â  

a valiant attempt of this kind which was exposed at the plenary meeting of
the C.C. (in August 1908).  At that time the Golos people proposed
to the Bund comrades to join in a conspiracy to disrupt the C.C.  But a
member of the C.C. of the Bund (ComradeÂ E.) informed of this a Bolshevik
member of the C.C. (ComradeÂ G.) who had just been released from prison, and
the conspiracy failed. We still have on file the letter from the member of
the Bund C.C. in which he writes that the Golos leaders deny the
C.C. its very âExistenzrecktâ (right to exist) and propose replacing it
with some sort of information
bureau.[7] The fact that the proposal to betray the Party was made by
the Golos people in the C.C. to the Bund C.C. was confirmed also
by other comrades from the Bund at the December (1908) conference (see the
minutes of the conference).  Add to this the recent exposure by the
Menshevik comrades Alexei Moskovsky and G.Â V. Plekhanov, and also the fact
that Golos Sotsial-Demokrata has not once come out against the
liquidators, but, on the contrary, constantly defends them, demanding that
they now be recognised on a par with the Party, and even takes up the
cudgels for Roman, Mikhail and Yuri, and you will have a pretty clear
picture of the prolonged, indefatigable, stubborn and most insidious
attempts of all kinds by which the liquidators are seeking to achieve their
purposeâto wreck the Party.  At the same time the danger of the
liquidationist trend and the need to fight it most vigorously will become
obvious even to the blind. In view of this we believe that now is the time
to publish also the letter of the Bund C.C. member ComradeÂ E. and in
general all the facts relative to the attempts to liquidate the
Party.  

Second. If the two Golos menâour colleagues on the
Central Organâwrite you that âa minimum of respect for the Party should
have obligedâ us âto relinquish, our responsible Party positionsâ, we
believe that common political decency and a minimum of self-respect should
have induced them to abandon the false position they adopt in the Party and
in the Central Organ by coming out simultaneously in defence of the
liquidators. Incidentally, as distinct from them, we are not at all
inclined to ascribe

  Â  

evil intentions to them as individuals. The lies, the black mail threats
and all their other virtues spring not from their ill will, hut from their
false position which compels them to breed falsehood at every step. Es ist
der Fluch der bÃ¶sen Tat, dass sie immer BÃ¶ses muss
   gebÃ¤hren.[4]

And the curse of their misdeed consists precisely in that they
simultaneously occupy seats in the Party organ and in the organ which is
out to liquidate the Party, with the result that they assume the
contradictory mission of standing both for the Party and against it. For
this reason they do not even have the âcourageâ of the Romans, the Yuris
and the Mikhails. This position of theirs is compatible neither with common
political decency nor with a minimum of self-respect. This is what creates
that false position, that, so to speak, peculiar brand of
Azefism[8] for liquidationist purposes, which impels them, with
the best of intentions, toward the most unworthy actions.

Here the authors of the statement indignantly say that the âreaders of
the article are likewise not told that the Polish Social-Democrats to
this day have not been able to find anybody who would agree to represent
them in the C.C.â More, they have the temerity to underline these
words. This is just as foul a lie as the other allegations in the
statement. Just as the Polish Social-Democrats had their representative in
the C.C. before the plenary meeting, so they have one now, after it, who is
waiting for word when to attend the C.C. meeting. Already a week ago the
Polish C.C. member received a letter from his colleague in Moscow to the
effect that he still has to wait, for the C.C. cannot be convened as yet.

become an affiliate of Proletary and declared their intention to
continue publishing Golos Sotsial-Demokrata. Lenin analysed this
document and gave it a political appraisal in the articles âGolos

6.Â IV.Â 10 

Dear K., 

I received your letter (at last! I was about to kick up a
row). It is too late to send an express message or a wire.  

We are in too âgreat hasteâ, you write. I donât
       know....[1]

How could Dan and Co. have been allowed to get away with it? And what
elseÂ ... wait for. But it is a great pity you were not in âgreater hasteâ
to write us at once about the âformal doubtsâ entertained by the
Pravda liquidators. The proofs were sent to you ten days ago: if
you had made haste to reply at once that you are not clear 011
this or that point, you would have had complete copies of the letters from
Russia already a week ago. Now the C.O., which came out late last
night, gives more quotations from the
letters.[2] 

Is your withdrawal from Pravda essential for
us?[3] You seem almost ready to say yesâagain being âin hasteâ to
write after the very first conflict with Trotsky.  

I personally do not think that your withdrawal from Pravda is
essential [to us], so long as Pravda [is] run so
colourlessly. After readingÂ ... [your] item in No.Â 11, I thought ([and]
Grigory also said): this is toothless, colourless, [inconsequential],
verbose....  

What is the purpose of our policy now, at this precise moment?
To build the Party core not on the cheap phrases of
Trotsky and Co. but on genuine ideological rapprochement between
the Plekhanovites and the Bolsheviks. Whether this will work out I
do not know. If it doesnât, then back to the Bolshevik Centre. If it does,
it will be a substantial step forward.  

We shall write to the Russian C.C. (insisting that Makar call it
together without waiting for the Menshevik scoundrels) that Dan (and
Martov) should be expelled from

  Â  

the C.O. and Igor from the C.C. Bureau Abroad and replaced with
Plekhanovites.  The Plekhanovites printedÂ ...  [in an issueÂ ] of Golos
Sotsial-Demokrata (you [ought to receive itÂ ] within a few
days[4]).  

...Â [53] for the Golos people ... against ... 10 ....  For the
PlekhanovitesÂ 11 ... but it isnât do much a matter of numbers as of the
beginning of a break. The first step is always the hardest.  

In a few days the Mensheviks Will publish Martynovâs reply to
Plekhanov and, evidently, a reply to the C.O. Although Plekhanov does
wish to keep open the possibility of âreturningâ to the
Golos people, nothing so far seems to be coming of it.  

Your withdrawal from Pravdaâif it is inevitableâshould in
my view be arranged with the utmost care (write an article against the
liquidators and against Golos, let Trotsky turn it down!) with a
view to reporting to the C.O. and drafting a decision on the
publication of a popular newspaper by the Central Organ. Either that, or
back to....  

The Vienna group will say nothing.  

About the report, I am not satisfied. To remind a per son does not mean
to harass him. Send the beginning. The whole thing by MayÂ 1 will
be too late.  

With best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

L.Â B. Kamenev was delegated to the Editorial Board of Trotskyâs
Pravda after the January 1910 plenary meeting of the Central
Committee, which put off the question of making the paper an organ of the
C.C. until the next Party conference, but decided to subsidise it and to
send its representative to the Editorial Board âas a third editorâ. After
the publication in the paperâs issue No.Â 14 of âLetter from
Pravda to Thinking Workersâ in which Trotsky sided with the
liquidators and the otzovists, Kamenev withdrew from the Editorial Board.

â... what is Golos Sotsial-Demokrata for Mensheviks of a certain
orientation? It is in effect their factionalâand, moreover,
irresponsibleâcentre. By voting for the resolution pledging the closure
of Golos... our âMensheviksââmembers of the C.C.âlaid down on
the altar of the Party the heart, so to say, of their faction. The skeptic
will say that not all promises are carried out. But, I repeat, we have no
right to think that the comrades who gave this promise were insincere.â

Dear Comrades, 

Yesterdayâs exchange of views with your representatives in the general
Party
     institution[1]

showed us that your

  Â  

delegates are hesitant about waging a resolute struggle for the Party and
against the liquidators, embarking on the path of âconciliationâ which
objectively does a service only to the liquidators.  

Hesitation at such a crucial moment in Party life is, we are deeply
convinced, of advantage only to the enemies of the Party.  

We shall be compelled to pursue a policy upholding the Party principle
Without your delegates, or, perhaps, even against
them. We hereby inform you of this in brief. We shall give you a more
detailed explanation within the next few days, in all probability, in the
press.  

We trust that you will understand why we are turning first of all to
you, an organisation so close to us ideologically and politically.  

With comradely greetings,

 Bolshevik members of the Editorial Board

 of the Central Organ

AprilÂ 10, 1910 

Dear Comrade, 

Yesterdayâs conference convinced us finally of Some thing about Which
we had little doubt even before it, namely, that you in no way represent
the Bolshevik trend which you claim to represent in the C.C. Bureau Abroad.


Having every ground for considering ourselves representatives of the
Bolshevik trend, on the strength of letters

  Â  

from like-minded comrades in Russia and of the policy pursued by the
Bolsheviks living abroad, we declare that your wavering policy, your
willingness to tolerate the presence in the C.C. Bureau Abroad of Igor, a
liquidator and plotter against the Party, to cover up the disruption by him
of Party
unity[2] (instead of exposing Igor, of presenting an ultimatum to the
C.C. demanding his removal and resolutely combating the liquidators and
upholding the alliance of the Bolsheviks and the pro-Party
Mensheviks, an alliance which alone could perhaps save the cause
of unity)âthis behaviour of yours convinces us that you, willingly or
unwillingly, are a pawn in the hands of the liquidators.  

We reserve the right, to bring our statement to the attention of the
Bolsheviks and, if need be, the entire Party and press.

The disruption of Party unity by C.C. Bureau Abroad member

MarchÂ 16, 1910, the C.C. Bureau Abroad published as a leaflet the letter
âTo All Comrades Abroadâ urging all groups to abide by the decisions of
the January 1910 plenary meeting of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., to take the most
vigorous steps to put an end to the organisational division, to follow the
example of the Bolsheviks and close factional organs. Together with the
representative of the Bund in the C.C. Bureau Abroad, Gorev-Goldman voted
against endorsing the letter. This was made public by the Editorial Board
of Golos Sotsial-Demokrata in its âLetter to Comradesâ.

Dear Comrade, 

I enclose herewith two appeals concerning the May Day demonstrations

printed in an underground printery. I shall try to get other publications
of this kind for you, although this is extremely difficult considering the

Dear Comrade, 

I. Be so kind as to order the following hooks for the editorial office:


1) Report of the Peopleâs Freedom Group at the Third Session of the
Duma (Pravo bookshop, St.Â Petersburg, or V.Â A. Kharlamov,
7. Potyomkinskaya. St.Â Petersburg, apply to them). Price 50Â k.  

2) In Memory of N.Â G. Chernyshevsky. Reports and speeches by
Annensky, Antonovich, Tugan-Baranovsky, etc.  Price 50Â k. (Obshchestvennaya
Polza, St.Â Petersburg, 40 Nevsky, FlatÂ 43.)  

II. Further. With regard to the report you were extremely
careless not to have sent it registered. I have given the post office here
Rappoportâs address. But this is not enough.  Send at once
notifications to the Administration desÂ postes in Pornic, asking
them as the sender that the package be readdressed to Rappoport, and attach
an addressed post card for their reply.  

III. As regards the Public MovementâBritman is said to have
brought it and left it at the forwarding office for me. If not, I shall
send an inquiry to Grigory, and you ask him about it too when you have
a chance.  
 

IV. As regards guests at the Copenhagen Congress I cannot say
anything.[2] As far as I know it is customary for people to be admitted
freely to the gallery. Take a leaflet from my parcel to the C.C. Bureau
Abroad (which I am sending by book-post)âyou will find there a printed
leaflet with the address of the chairman of the local organising
committee[3]: he is the one to apply to If you want to find out for
sure in advance.  

V. I am enclosing a letter for the C.C. Bureau
       Abroad.[1]

Please hand it over as soon as possible.  

VI. What about the report? I beg of you to speed up its
publication.  

With best regards,

 Yours,

 N.Â Lenin

Dear M., 

Be so kind as to forward the enclosed letter by express to Pyatnitsa.


I have received a letter from the secretary of the C.C. Bureau Abroad
quoting Schwarz as saying that Huysmans has forbidden the reports to be
more than four pages long. Kindly inform that secretary that if he wishes
he can get in touch with Huysmans direct. I only know one thingâwe
are printing the report ourselves; who can forbid us to make
it long? The important thing is to see to it that the re port is ready
in time for the congress, and we shall circulate it among
the delegates ourselves. That the report is sup posed to be
printed in three languages I have known for

  Â  

some time, but what if we havenât the money? Will they âforbidâ its
publication in one language?  

I enclose a letter from the bank presenting me with a statement of
account and demanding from me (as always) a written reply signed
by me certifying the correctness of the figures. I am enclosing my written
reply,[1]

i.e., a form with my signature (and dated in my handwriting AugustÂ 4, so, N.B., donât send it before that). Please check the
account and, if correct, send my letter.  

With best wishes and regards to O.A.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin 

P.S. About Copenhagen, yesterday I sent a letter to the C.C. Bureau
Abroad asking them to notify the Bund C.C. and the Latvians. Did you take
into account the expenses for the trip to Copenhagen? They say it will cost
250â300 francs per delegate, of whom there will be eight at the
maximum. Will you have enough for that out of the 75,000?

AugustÂ 8 (N.S.), 1910 

Dear Comrade, 

I have a small personal favour to ask of you. I should like to make use
of the opportunity provided by the congress in Copenhagen to work in a
Copenhagen library. I should be much obliged if you could inform me: 
 

1) Whether the Copenhagen library is open all the time in September
(the National or the University, I do not know which is better. I need data
on agriculture in Denmark).  

2) How much a furnished room in Copenhagen would cost by the week or
month, and whether you could help me to find a room, provided this
would not take you away from your work.  

My address until AugustÂ 23

 Mr. Wl.Â Oulianoff.

 Rue Mon DÃ©sir. Villa les Roses.

 Pornic (Loire-InfÃ©rieure).

 France.  

Lenin 

Forgive me for troubling you. Thanking you in advance and with best
regards.

Dear Comrade, 

I am very grateful to you for the information and for your kind offer
of assistance. If it is not too much trouble, rent me a simple,
inexpensive, small room from the 26th.  

I shall be in Copenhagen by the morning of the 26th (for the Bureau
meeting). I shall try to drop in and see you the same morning (I donât know
when the train comes in, I shall probably go through Hamburg-KorsÃ¶r). If
you go out, leave a letter for me with the landlady (fÃ¼r Herrn
Ulianoff). I shall take the room by the week or for a month, depending on
what is more customary in Copenhagen.  

I shall be in Copenhagen about ten days from August 26, then
perhaps I shall go away for a week on personal
business[1] and then return to Copenhagen again. Therefore

  Â  

a cheap room for a month (if you, renting for a longer period, pay 12Â kr,,
I would probably have to pay about 15â18Â kr. for a similar room) would be
more convenient. If you have no time, do not bother, I shall be
able to find something myself on AugustÂ 26 or 27, since the Bureau meeting
will only take up the morning.  

With best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear M.Â F., 

14.VIII.Â 10 

I hasten to inform you that I have received at last the reply
concerning Triaâs report, The secretary of the Editorial Board writes that
âTriaâs report has been put to the vote, translated and almost all set up,
and will go as a supplementâ (i.e., a supplement to the general report of
the Party). And so, everything has turned out
well.[1] 

I have no news to report. On AugustÂ 23 I am going to Copenhagen. What
news have you? What did you learn from that large assembly of people, that
âhouseful of guestsâ you wrote about?  

Best wishes, from Nadya as well. Greetings to A.Â M. and all the Capri
crowd.  

Yours,
 V.U

The report by Tria (V.Â Mgeladze) which was to be appended to the
R.S.D.L.P. report to the Copenhagen Congress was printed later in Russian
by special decision of the Central Organ (see letter to Maxim Gorky of
NovemberÂ 14, 1910, present edition, Vol.Â 34, p.Â 433). The Tria report is
not among the supplements to the Copenhagen Congress report.

Copenhagen,
      September[1]

Â 2,

1910 

Dear Comrades, 

The AugustÂ 28 issue of VorwÃ¤rts carried an utterly
outrageous anonymous article about the state of affairs in the Russian
Party.[2] At the height of the work of the International Congress, when
everyone is moved by the desire to preserve socialist unity, to discuss
with the utmost caution the internal disputes in the parties of the
different countries, to avoid if possible interfering in these disputes, to
demonstrate the strength, the grandeur and moral prestige of
Social-Democracy in all countriesâat this very time the Central Organ of
the German Party suddenly, without any reason, without the slightest
apparent need, prints an article containing incredible at tacks on Russian
Social-Democracy. The above-mentioned article shamelessly criticises the
entire Social-Democratic movement in Russia; it strives to represent
Russian Social-Democracy to the foreign public in the darkest colours, as
being in a state of decline, impotence and degeneration. Further, it
assails and slanders all the existing groups and trends in the Party
without exception, from top to bottom; and, finally, it contains crude
attacks on official central bodies of the Partyâthe Central Commit tee
and the Central Organâaccusing them of factional prejudice, etc,;
individual members of these central bodies too are slandered in the most
outrageous manner.  

Such an article in the Central Organ of the German Party, the anonymous
author of which was prompted solely by a desire for revenge for some petty
personal grievance, will damage the interests of the Social-Democratic
movement in Russia; it constitutes an unexampled violation of international
solidarity and brotherhood in relation to Russian Social-Democracy. And if
the Russian Party, which has many well-known writers, has for several years

  Â  

avoided parading its internal affairs on the pages of the German Party
press, that is only because it does not consider the foreign press to be a
suitable battlefield for settling its disputes. The building of the unity
of the Social-Democratic Party of Russia is and remains the paramount and
most difficult task for all the comrades in Russia, and primarily for the
central bodies of the Party. Clearly, it is essential, in the interests of
preserving unity, to avoid anything that is prejudicial to the resolving of
internal differences. No one of course should object to the problems of
Russian Party life being treated in a calm, objective manner. But we are
most emphatically opposed to malevolent, petty and treacherous attacks on
the movement, the Party and its central bodies, such as that contained in
the above-mentioned article, the more so since the anonymous author who
poses as an omniscient outsider is introduced as a correspondent of the
Central Organ, the newspaper VorwÃ¤rts, which lends the article
an official editorial character.

Dear Comrade, 

I shall be here until SeptemberÂ 25. On the morning of the 26th of
September (Monday) I intend to be in Copenhagen

  Â  

and would like to spend as little time there as possible. If you
think it worth arranging a public or Party lecture on the
Copenhagen Congress, please arrange it for Monday (in the evening, of
course, since it is a
      workday).[1]

I could then leave on Tuesday, for it is time for me to be in Paris, and I
must now make haste. Regarding the room, please find out whether I could
spend the night there on the 26th. If not, I shall return the keys when and
where you say (I have taken them with me). By the way, I left a book on the
table (reports and the main report for the Copenhagen Congress in French,
in a folder). If the former lodger occupies the room on the morning of the
26th of September I would kindly ask you to go there and pick up the book
so that I could get it from you.  

My address: Herrn Wl.Â Ulianoff. Adr. Frk. W. Berg. 17.
I. Kaptensgatan. 17. I. Stockholm. Drop me a line when you find out and
decide about the lecture.  

With best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

I have notified the treasurer of the Central Committee of our Party

As for the dues to he paid by the Duma deputies belonging to the

that the secretary of the Social-Democratic group in the Duma notify you of
his address.  

Respectfully yours,

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

One of my friends, Comrade Petrov, will call on you tomorrow or the day
after. Be kind as to give him one copy each of the reports of the different
parties to the Copenhagen Congress. It is extremely difficult for the
Russian socialists to obtain these reports. That is why it is

  Â  

most important for us to âutiliseâ the travels of private individuals to
circulate a few copies of the reports in Russia.  

Accept, dear comrade, my fraternal greetings,

 N.Â Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

Having walked out of todayâs meeting I consider it my duty to explain
to you, in case of any Party (and quasi-Party) rumours and gossip, the
significance of my action. I consider it not only my right but my duty to
refuse to participate in a so-called âdiscussionâ which serves as a
pretext for the liquidationist section of the Editorial Board to indulge in
the worst kind of rumours circulated by the worst kind of anti-Party
elements. When Martov, for ex ample, refers to the otzovists as a section
of the Party, and at the same time openly repeats the gossip noised by the
most blackguard elements of the otzovists abroad, alleging that the case of
Comrade Victor was closed or hushed up as a result of
bribery,[2] and at the same time demands that they, Martov and
Dan, be protected from such suspicions on the part of âa section of the
Partyâ, then anyone can see quite clearly that under cover of
âprotectionâ from otzovist blackmail we are being offered
nothing more nor less than liquidationist abetting of otzovist
sallies of the worst kind.  

Considering it beneath my dignity to participate in a
âdiscussionâ in which such things are brought up, I declare

  Â  

that in future too I shall try to walk out of any meeting where there is
such a âdiscussionâ.  

With comradely greetings,

 N.Â Lenin 

7.XI.10 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The chairman of the meeting of the Editorial Board of the C.O. probably
was either A.Â Warski or his deputy V.Â Leder.





[2]
One of the questions taken up at the January 1910 plenary meeting of
the C.C. was the case of V.Â K. Taratuta (Victor), a member of the Bolshevik
Centre, who demanded that the C.C. institute an inquiry concerning the
rumours circulated in the Party defaming him. The plenary meeting appointed
an investigation commission which after a thorough inquiry unanimously
agreed that there were no grounds whatever for accusing Victor of being a
provocateur and cleared his name completely.

Dear V.Â D., 

I received today more news about the new literary
child[1] but, surprisingly, not a word from you. What does this mean? I
am extremely worried about the fate of the child. They write, for instance,
that they fear the material sent is out of date. This worries me greatly. I
insist most categorically that everything sent in should be published (with
corrections owing to âunforeseen circumstancesâ if need be). This is
after all a matter of principle, a matter of policy. We have no information
as yet on this question, we are depending on you, and you are silent. This
is impossible. A few lines from you once or twice a week is the minimum
necessary to maintain contact and to feel closer to things. To make matters
worse, there are letters from, the âdiscontentedâ (I received a long
letter today from one of themâI daresay you can guess from whom). And so
I beg you: write, write more often and in greater detail.  

Warmest regards to V.Â M.

 Yours,

 Starik

I.Â P. Pokrovsky (a representative of the Social-Democratic group in the
Third Duma, a Bolshevik sympathiser). The publisher was Duma deputy
N.Â G. Poletayev, a Bolshevik.

Dear V.Â D., 

I wrote you the other
 day.[1]

Am writing again today because I have received some extremely disturbing
news, which seems to indicate some dissention at your end. Dissention over
what, I cannot understand. What the trouble is I do not
know.[2] You really must not leave us here without
informationâafterwards we are blamed for holding up things. Why shouldnât
like-minded people be able to work together on a newspaper, once there is
agreement on the main thing, namely, not to allow the Potresovs and similar
riffraff from Nasha Zarya to come anywhere near
it?[3] And such agreement does exist. We shall notify them today of our
opinion that a third be included (there was a c]ear understanding, after
all, that the third place belonged to
us).[4] I am informing you in order that there should be no
misunderstanding. The third has one-third of the decisive sayâis that so
much? Are you against that? I hope not. I would be very glad if this
business could be settled without friction. It is time, high time, to get
started on the paper and the journal too. As regards the journal, we are
not asking for much:
find us an executive secretary and a couple of applicants for permission to
publish.[5] Surely that is not so difficult to arrange? Well, I shall
wait for word from you.  

I hope that the matter of the discontented will now be settled. After
all, there is nothing to quarrel about.

Zvezda the organ of the Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma,
to which end the Menshevik Duma deputies Gegechkori and Kuznetsov were
invited to contribute to it. This led to misunderstandings in the Editorial
Board.

Dear Colleague, 

We sent a few things off today:
1) a postscript to the article about Muromtsev (it would be wrong not to
react, even now),
2) about the reasons and significance of rapprochement between the
Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks (the title can be changed),
3) about the political differences in the working-class
      movement,[1]

4) about the Octobrists,
5) the industrial congress and the workers,
6) the trade union trend.  

Please try to insert them and reply as soon as possible.  

Please turn them over to our
       editor[2]

without delay, urgently. Let me know whether all the friction has been
eliminated.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear V.Â D., 

I received a letter from you some time ago but unfortunately I could
not obtain any idea from it concerning the matter of the remittance we are
interested in. I have heard you are very displeased about something. What?
How? Why? Have things been settled? I donât know anything. It

Is very, very depressing. And we must make utmost haste, for the
hostile elements are threatening us from the rear. We have done what we
could here to secure what was lacking. A benefactor turned up. We are
sending it. Please see to it that we are not left without information. You
must let us know at least once a week about the receipt of remittances,
etc. For all we hear now are some rumours about dissatisfaction, and
nothing else. Some people seem to have invented some sort of distinction
between liquidationism and the liquidators. What sophistry! We want neither
the one nor the other. But of course you yourselves will give them a
rebuff. Greetings to V.Â M. My wife sends you her very best regards.  

Starik

I propose: 

1) printing in the Central Organ a translation of this letter at once
(perhaps with some slight cuts); 

2) approaching the trade unions (and also trade union
committees in the different towns) of transport workers, shipbuilders,
workers employed at factories making fire arms, ammunition, guns, military
supplies, etc. (and where there are no trade unions, groups of
workers), and asking them to send the Central Organ written contributions,
information, descriptions of past strikes, etc.; 

3) publishing at once in brief our opinion (Î±) that what
is in question is not an isolated act of âpreventing warâ (averting), but
revolutionary pressure by the masses of the proletariat in
general, and (Î²) that with the present state of affairs in Russia we
attach the greatest importance to studying the course and conditions of the
strikes of 1905.  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
On DecemberÂ 17, 1910, Lenin received a circular letter dated
DecemberÂ 15, 1910, from the International Socialist Bureau to the parties
affiliated with the Second International asking them to consider an
amendment to the Copenhagen Congress (1910) resolution on arbitration and
disarmament which the Congress had referred to the I.S.B. Since the
amendment dealt with strikes of war industry workers as an expedient means
of preventing the outbreak of war, the I.S.B. proposed that the parties
approach the trade unions concerned and report back to the I.S.B. Lenin
made marginal notes on the circular (see Lenin Miscellany XXV,
pp.Â 260 and 261). He sent it to the Editorial Board of Sotsial
Demokrat for publication, together with the present letter. Neither
the circular nor Leninâs letter were published in
Sotsial-Demokrat.

31.I.Â 11 

Dear Comrade, 

You have probably not forgotten that you promised an article for our
journal Mysl. The first issue of Mysl has already come
out (in Moscow) and it has not been confiscated. It contains, among other
things, articles by Plekhanov on Tolstoy and on Italian opportunism
(compared with our liquidators), my article on statistics on strikes during
the Russian
     revolution,[1]

Rozhkovâs article on the new agrarian policy of the Russian
counter-revolutionaries, etc. Issue No.Â 2 will be out shortly. We would be
extremely grateful to you if you could write something for usâabout
neutrality, for instance, and against trade union neutrality. This question
has again been coming up for discussion here now and perhaps you will like
to dwell in somewhat greater detail on what you wrote about Legien in
Neue Zeit. Needless to say, we shall be happy to receive any
article from you on any
subject.[4] 

I am sending you by book-post my article against Martov and Trotsky,
not for publication, but to ask your advice. Karski has already replied to
Martov You wanted to leave it to me to write the article against
Trotsky. But you will see from my article that it is very difficult for me
to criticise Trotsky without touching Martov. Perhaps you could advise me
how to make the article suitable for Neue
     Zeit.[2]

 

I should like to offer the editors of Neue Zeit two more
articles: I) on Russian strike statistics for 1905â07. This is probably
the first time we have statistics on mass strikes (economic and political
separately) for the entire period of the revolution. The opportunists
(=Menshevik liquidators) are constantly accusing us Russian Bolsheviks of
âromanticismâ and âBlanquismâ. The best answer to this perhaps is dry
statistics which might be not without interest for the German comrades as
well. If you agree in principle, I shall send you either a detailed excerpt
from my article or else the complete translation. I am only afraid that my
article will be too long for Neue Zeit.  

2) I have prepared for a Russian journal a summary of German
agricultural production statistics for 1907 (the three volumes already
out).[3]

I donât know yet whether it will be printed in Russia or not. As can be
seen from the German Social-Democratic press, this subject has already been
discussed, but regrettably (for instance in VorwÃ¤rts) solely on
the basis of a bourgeois treatment of the material. I have come to the
conclusion that the 1907 census bears out the Marxist theory and refutes
the bourgeois (including Davidâs theory). The data on female and child
labour (employed more by peasants owning 5â10 hectares of land
than by the capitalists or by proletarian farms), for instance, seem
particularly interesting to me. Here the number of working members of the
family and of hired workers is given for the first time. It turns out that
in the group of owners with 10â20 hectares of land the number of hired
workers amounts on the average to 1.7 per farm, and the number of working
members of the family, to 3.4. These are already big peasants who cannot do
without wage labour.  

Extremely instructive, too, is the classification of farms according to
total number of workers (I break them up

  Â  

into three main groups: 1â3, 4â5, 6 and more workers, including hired
labour).  

Do you think such a treatment would be of interest to German readers?
If so, I would gladly write on this subject for Neue Zeitâonly
the work I have prepared is far too voluminous!  

If the âpeasant farmsâ (5â10, 10â20 hectares) specially prospered
in the period 1895â1907, this, in my opinion, is no evidence of the
success of âsmall-scale productionâ. It merely testifies to the success
of intensive capitalist farming and livestock raising in
particular. The reduction in the area of the farms signifies expansion of
capitalist and big-peasant livestock farming.  

I trust that you are now quite well and that you will answer Quessel
and Maslov yourself.  

With best wishes,

 Yours,

 N.Â Lenin 

P.S. I am very grateful to your wife for writing to me during your
illness. I wanted to write her myself but thought that instead of giving my
opinion about Trotskyâs article in a letter, it would be better to send my
article. I am sending it not only for you, but also for your wife, as an
answer to her letter.

After giving thought to the whole agreement (resp. the
formulation of a common base and line of action for all of us) arrived at
in the Bureau between the
P.S.D.[1]

and both Bolshevik trends, I cannot but point to the weakness, the
shortcomings of that
base.[2] 

The essence of the agreement is (a) to lay down a precise, clear-cut
anti-Golos and anti-Vperyod line of principle, i.e., to
reiterate and reaffirm struggle against both liquidationism and otzovism in
absolutely concrete terms ruling out any misrepresentations and evasions
(from which the Party has suffered so much); 

(b) a practical âreformâ, i.e., such a change in the composition of
all centres (or rather in the âfactionsâ or âtrendsâ
represented in them) as would guarantee the pursuance of this line
of principle.  

How does this work out? Both the theoretical âlineâ and the practical
activities are determined by the Central Committee. And its composition? In
the event of a simple âultimatumâ (and a cheap, very cheap one to boot)
from notorious dodgers, prevaricators, scoundrels and unprincipled
bargainers (like the Bund), etc., you are âpreparedâ to set the
number of members atÂ 8. And thisÂ 8 is equivalent (as is now obvious) to
two groups of four.  

The result: neutralisation, i.e., the complete impotence of
the C.C.!!  

This is exactly what the liquidators want.  

No reforms in our sense (i.e., as we have all agreed)
could be carried out with such a composition.  

It is an absurd situation: we agree to give the Party

  Â  

the money, Rabochaya
Gazeta[3] and all our energies conditionally. On what
conditions? The line of principle and the reform. Who carries out the one
and the other? The C.C. And what is the guarantee that they will be carried
out by the C.C.? A chance ultimatum presented by the enemies of
Social-Democracy (such as the liquidators from the Bundist
intelligentsia)!!  

An agreement to do what the C.C. cannot possibly do
with eight members.  

That is the result.  

That result is a repetition of the mistake made by the plenary
meeting[4]: good wishes, nice words, excellent ideasâbut no power to
carry them into effect. Castigation of the liquidators in words and
captivity to the liquidators in reality.  

It is for you practical workers to carry out the âagreementââyou
are the ones who introduced the clause concerning the eight. It is my duty,
after studying the agreement carefully, to warn you: the
liquidators will again make fools of you!  

It is easy to âcall oneselfâ a Plekhanovite (Adrianov and his ilk
would doubtless call themselves the devil and satan if only to get
some small concession: a title is a word, but a concession is
reality).  

In reality you will be getting with your eight an impotent
institution shackled by the liquidators. That is the danger of which I
consider it my duty specially to warn you.  

If you, as practical workers, undertake to establish a
C.C. (or rather, an eight) capable both of condemning the
Golos and Vperyod people, and of carrying out the
reformâthat is up to you. Heartily desiring peace and accord
with you, I am pledged to help you to carry out your plan.  

But to help does not mean lulling you with âthe enchantment of fine
wordsâ. To help means to point to the real dangers which one
must be able to avoid.  

The plenary meeting of January 1910 held up the practical work of the
centres for a year by tying their hands, letting them be
shackled by the liquidators. In the spring of 1910 Inok did
not succeed in escaping from that

  Â  

bondage. In the beginning of 1911 you will not be able to either,
unless you take urgent measures to carry out the agreement.  

Best wishes,

 N.Â Lenin

A reference to the âPoints of Agreementâ drawn up by the Polish
Social-Democrats, on the one hand, and the Bolsheviks and the conciliators,
on the other, and adopted on FebruaryÂ 11, 1911, in

 Â  

Paris, concerning the composition and the immediate tasks of the central
Party bodies, and especially to Point 2 of the agreement, which read as
follows: âThe C.C. is to consist of 4 Bolsheviks+1 Polish
Social-Democrat+2 Plekhanovites (variant: 1Â Plekhanovite +1 from
Golos)+1 from the Bund+1 Latvian.â This was followed by the
reservation which Lenin criticises as reducing the first part of the point
to nought: âOnly after the Latvian and Bundist have formally announced on
behalf of their organisations that they are withdrawing from the C.C. if it
is thus constituted, will we demand as the ultimate minimum: 3Â Bolsheviks+1
Polish Social-Democrat+1 from Golos+1 Plekhanovite+1 Latvian+1
Bundist.â The agreement was signed by Leon Tyszka, A.Â Rykov, G.Â Zinoviev,
and others.

(NovemberÂ 12), 1910. to JulyÂ 30 (AugustÂ 12), 1912. All told nine issues
came out. Launched on Leninâs initiative, it was officially founded in
August 1910 by decision of a conference of representatives of the
Bolsheviks, pro-Party Mensheviks, the Social-Democratic group in the Duma,
and other sections of the R.S.D.L.P. Lenin was the paperâs guiding spirit
and editor.  

The Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. commended
the paperâs vigorous and consistent defence of the Party and Party
principle and proclaimed it an official organ of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P.

Dear Al., 

We are sending you some novelties: 

1) Igorâs statement (copy) submitted by him today to the Central
Committee Bureau
       Abroad.[1]
[3]


2) The resolution of the San Remo âgroupâ (read Plekhanov âand his
householdâ).  

Today Lieber told the C.C. Bureau Abroad that Adrianov is near Moscow
and that according to his, Lieberâs, information the question of whether to
call the C.C. in Russia or abroad is being discussed.  

In our opinion Mikhail Mironych must be sent to the
      Samovars[2]

(we are trying to send him to you tomorrow, i.e., to get him to leave
tomorrow. I spoke to him today and he agreed). He has a reason for finding
it inconvenient to go to Russia just now, but the reason is
unimportant and he has agreed to go to Russia also. Here is what
you should do: send him at once with two assignments:
(1) to send Lyubich abroad immediately;
(2) to see the Samovars and persuade them to decide for abroad and leave.


It is unreasonable, absurd, mad to risk failure when in the enclosed
official paper Igor expresses himself in favour of abroad and even
promises to get not only Adrianov abroad, but also the âLondon
candidatesâ[4] (i.e., Roman+

  Â  

Adrianov, in any case two: hence the obvious and imperative need for Lyubich, otherwise our three will not
make the majority).  

Tomorrow we are sending the theses for the declaration on the
liquidators and otzovists.  

With best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

who together with other liquidators had sabotaged the work of the Bureau of
the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., in Russia for a year and a half.

Dear Colleague, 

I received your letter of February 10 about the betrayal of the person
you call âY.â.  

You ask me to âannounce thisâ to the
58Â Mensheviks.[6] You must forgive me but I cannot comply with the
request. I do not intend to announce anything or to have anything to do
with such individuals. If you do not understand why, I shall tell you once
again.  

You close your letter with the words: âDonât you people in Paris
realise how your squabbles affect us?â  

The liquidators in Paris understand full well what they are doing. It
is a pity that among you in St.Â Petersburg there are people who do not
understand what they are doing and what they read. A great pity! Such
people are fated always to be led by the nose. The liquidators here, i.e.,
the Golos people, put out leaflets, such as the leaflet of the 58,
specially to provoke squabbles and confuse the struggle over issues of
principle. We have declared (in every issue of the Central Organ and every
issue of other
     publications[1]

known to you and closer to youâspatially) that we shall not
tolerate the group of Mr.Â Potresov
  Â  

and Co., the ideas of Nasha Zarya, etc., that we cannot tolerate
them, but are fighting them and shall continue to fight them
unrelentingly. This is a company of liquidators, enemies of
Social-Democracy, and their ideas are the ideas of traitors.  

The Golos people are unable to wage a principled struggle
against this and hence the Martovs, Dans, Axelrods and
Martynovs reply with scandals and blackmail. Is the leaflet of the
58 not an instance of blackmail? The leaflet of the 58 contains
false accusations
  (insinuations)...,[2]

for instance, although the Bolsheviks absolutely loyally
liquidated after the January 1910 plenary meeting ... every thing
connected with them, Why make these accusations in the form of dark hints?
The answer is: a leaflet, also printed, also put out in Paris, also
originating in the Golos camp, only signed not by the 58 but by
the âEditorial Board of Golos Sotsial-Demokrataâ. What is the
content of this leaflet? It amounts to this: equality in the Editorial
Board of the C.O. and there will be
peace.[7] 

One comrade writes: is this not despicable? To level criminal charges
today and to write tomorrow: âLet in one more man into the Editorial Board
and there will be peace.â Why, that is blackmail!  

Can people with any political experience fail to see dozens of such
examples everywhere (especially in the Third Duma)? Has not the history of
Menshevism given a mass of examples of such blackmail? How often âcrimesâ
have been charged and then forgotten after equality or the
majority has been gained.  

As for me, I called the blackmailers blackmailers in print in May 1910
and in Diskussionny

    Listok.[3]

If there were some who did not heed the warning, so much the worse for
them.  

âY.â called the paper
âfoulâ. âY.â was right. I do not know
âY.â. I do not know what sort of retraction in press he
seeks, I have no idea of his views, his understanding, what he is doing. To
sum up: until you learn to fight

  Â  

the blackmailers they will continue to frustrate your efforts with
scandals, to spit in your face. If you do not like it, learn to fight and
not complain.  

Needless to say, we answered the blackmailers properly and will not
agree to any equality with them. We completely exposed the Potresov gang
for the liquidators they are. More, this gang is now flirting with
the group that violated after the January 1910 plenary meeting the
resolution
on....[4]

The Golos people are covering upÂ ... who are âagainstâ
Lenin-Plekhanov. This too we will expose, I can assure
you.  

You cannot sit between two stoolsâeither you are with the liquidators
or against them. I reserve the right to publish this letter. How are things
in the Editorial
       Board?[5]

You must see to it that we should be represented, by your self, if there is
no one else. At any rate you are obliged to find us a representative. Why
donât you return rejected articles?  Rappoport has sent two
articles but has received no reply.  

A young man, short, thick-set (Jewish), with a recommendation from me,
will shortly come to see you. Help him in any way you can.  

As for the paper, in my opinion, you should join it yourself for the
time being, so that our trend should not be left without a representative,
for that would be disgraceful. For we hope they will not give up under the
first pressure but will try to carry on despite the closures. All the more
necessary, then, is it for you to be there. Send us at once the
text of the platform worked out by the group for the Moscow
elections.[8] Will you come here to see us at Easter? There is much to
talk about. Do you know what has happened to Os.Â Petr.?

Dear Vlasov, 

We are sending you (and Grigory) a copy of a letter written today by
Semashko (a member of the Central Committee Bureau Abroad) to Grigory.


From this letter you will see of course that the crisis is coming to a
head. The Bundists have shown their
hand[1] (whether it was Makar who made them do so or the arrests in
Petersburg[2] that are to blame, God only knows).  

It is perfectly clear that the Bundists have understood full well the
simple truth that now everything depends on the votes: whether the
Poles+the Bundists will have one vote more or not.  

The Bundists are fighting desperately to have that extra vote in the
Central Committee.  

So much is clear. The Bundists are stopping at nothing to gain
that extra vote in the Central Committee by hook or by crook.  

Of the Golos Mensheviks there already are two that are
certain, the Londoners Kostrov and Pyotr, who was recently
released (we have been informed to that effect).  

The enemies, then, have fully united. The only way to save the day is
to get Makar, Lindov, Lyubich (and if possible Vadim)
out of the country at all costs, and without delay.  

Somebody must be sent over for this purpose. For Godâs sake canât you
see that by delaying the dispatch of a person you are risking every
day the arrest of Makar, the failure of everything. Send
Mikhail Mironych (and if he refuses, Chasovnikov from LiÃ©ge, or
Pyatnitsaâs wife, she has the proper papers and already went once) to both
Lyubich and Makar at once, without fail.  

If you donât do this, you are risking throwing away the last
chance of convening a plenary meeting and restoring the C.C. in general.


If Yudin is at loggerheads with Makar, it is possible that Makar too
has seen through the manoeuvres and trickery

  Â  

of the Bundists; but to see is not enough, one must know how to fight.


If Lindov cannot travel abroad, let Makar come alone
(after obtaining authorisation to act for the Bureau); with Makar here we
shall find a way out of the situation together with him.  

Reply at once.  

Yours,
 Lenin

abroad.

Dear Vlasov, 

It is a strange thing you are suggesting! Such a telegram
must not be sent, we cannot take the risk. If you want to chance
it, you could send it from Leipzig, but we do not advise you to do so.


Can money really be the hitch? Could they not have borrowed enough for
a ticket to Berlin??  

The delay is obviously not because of money.  

The Bundist scoundrel and liquidator (Lieber) goes around saying here
that he knows of some sort of hitch and some sort of trip to the
Caucasus(!!?).[1] 

Some more news: Kostrov and Pyotr have been released. Both
call themselves Plekhanovites.  

But we know for certain from the plenary meeting that both are
liquidators.  

You made a colossal mistake by not getting a proxy from the Samovars
and now are making things worse by not sending anybody to them. Donât you
see whatâs happening? Time is running out (the Pravda crowd are
already electing delegates in Moscow for the
conference^^207âa split is imminent). Youâre losing your patience. A
sheer comedy.  

Clearly, what we insisted on should have been done:
somebody should have been sent at once to the Samovars.

  Â  

Do so without delay, otherwise an absurd situation will develop.  

After all that has happened and after what you have said we too cannot
trust the Samovars and wait, wait for months and months. We will
be compelled by such procrastination to break off everything, to
tell the Germans that there is no C.C. and demand the money back
at once.  

There is nothing else left to do, and your passivity (âmay be the
Samovar will budgeâ) is to blame for everything.  

All the best,

 Lenin

A letter from Tyszka to Lenin and Zinoviev dated MarchÂ 20, 1911,
indicated that Noginâs proposal to hold the meeting of the âRussian
membersâ of the C.C. abroad, made at the end of February or the beginning
of March 1911 on the insistence of the Bolshevik Centre Abroad, met with
opposition from Yudin and Lindov. After a time Yudin went to the Caucasus
to fetch the Menshevik Adrianov with a view to holding the meeting in
Russia on their return. The meeting did not take place because Nogin,
noticing that his movements were being watched, left Tula and went into
hiding for a time.

Received your letter with the news about the call sent to M.Â M.  

You are doing right in sending it. So far the non-conciliators
have sent 4 (if not 6). This makes a big difference. Thatâs one
thing. Secondly, it is time to is sue an ultimatum; you yourself are aware
of this when you say: âone must lose all respect for the Party to drag
things out endlessly.â True! Right! Correct!  

Only there must be no threat to withdraw from the C.C., as you
propose. That would be a mistake. Donât do
that.[1]

Threaten to protest publicly against the Bureau and to show them up for a
nil or even worse if they, after having placed their confidence in you and
offered you their authorisation, do not go abroad at once.  
 

You should invite Lyubich. It will be a mistake not to. It is
ridiculous to grudge 200â300 extra rubles when it is a matter of the
finale of the entire C.C. Lyubich is needed precisely so
as not to be dependent on a âphilistine and
cowardâ.[3] Only from your letter did I see how base this
âphilistine and cowardâ is. People like that should be pinned to the
wall, and if they donât submit, trampled in the mud. I shall do that
publicly by printing the record of our relations with the Bureau when my
patience has been exhausted.  

There is full clarity now. Line-up against line-up. Itâs either 1/2+1
for us and the
P.S.D.[2]
[4]

or a Menshevik victory in the C.C., our withdrawal and a disgraceful
split. But even if only Makar and Lyubich are brought over the situation
could be saved: Plekhanov and the group will be for us, and we can
nip the Menshevik split in the bud. The scoundrels would not dare
in that case.  

I am enclosing a copy of a letter I received from a worker in
Bologna. He understood the Vperyod âplatformâ!! But
look at those Golos scoundrels: Golos agent
Volontyor, a member of the Party School Commission, goes
against its decision and carries on agitation against it
among the
ex-ists!![5] Now Iâll expose them in the
press.  

Semashko was sent from the School Commission to Bologna. The
blackguards have been caught red-handed, they wonât wriggle out of it!


Return the copy of the letter.  

I am enclosing a letter from Finikov (return immediately after
reading). Tell me, am I not right in saying that a Bolshevik like this is
stronger than a hundred âconciliatorsâ, for he has
understood the situation whereas the latter do not want to
understand it?  

With a few such we shall defeat hundreds of âconciliatorsâ.  

Greetings!
 N.Â Lenin 
 

Notes
 

[1]
If you withdraw from the C.C., it will be tantamount to deserting the
field of battle, betrayal of Bolshevism at a difficult moment. You must not
withdraw but send an ultimatum to Makar and, if he does not show up and
yield, fight as a member of the C.C. to get the money
returned.  âLenin

[2]
It is impossible to win in the seven. Therefore, it is necessary to
hold a plenary meeting abroad; call over Makar and Lyubich and ex plain
things to them.  âLenin
 



[3]
A reference to Lindov (G.Â D. Leiteisen) whom Rykov in one of his
letters to Lenin in 1911 called âa philistine and cowardâ. Lindov, then a
member of the Bureau of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., in Russia, took an
indecisive, vacillating position on the question of calling a plenary
meeting.





[4]
Out of the eight members of the Bureau of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., in
Russia, four Bolsheviks and one representative of the Polish
Social-Democrats.





[5]
The Party School Commission, established by decision of the January
1910 plenary meeting of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., was to

 Â  

arrange in 1911 additional lectures in Paris for graduates of the
Vperyod school.  

M.Â L. Veltman-Pavlovich (Volontyor), one of the lecturers at the
Vperyod school in Bologne, was a member of the party school
commission in March 1911. By giving a one-sided, factionalist picture of
the work of the commission, he incited the students against it with the
result that studies were disrupted.

Dear Comrade, 

I am sending you two
      letters.[2]

The first from Poletayev, the second from Negorev (Jordansky).  

They are the actual editors of Zvezda.  

They must be helped.  

There is only one sourceâthe Germans. Apply to the
      Vorstand[3]

through Pfannkuch. Ask for 5,000 marks (theyâll give you 3,000). Tyszka
once received money from them for
Trybuna[5] and now is asking for the second
timeâwhich means he probably considers you a âcompetitorâ. Bear this in
mind, try to find a fully reliable interpreter (we have some we
know, but they are very âcolonialâ people) and do not fail to get some
money from the Vorstand for Zvezda.  

Tyszka goes about it this way: he asks the Vorstand through Karski. The
Vorstand sends an inquiry to the Central Committee Bureau Abroad and issues
the money if there are no objections. If you do not wish the Bureau Abroad
to know that you are in Berlin, you must take some steps.  

I am enclosing a
  âcredentialâ,[4]

in case you need it.  

All the best,

 Lenin 

Did you get the letter with Alexandrovâs letter enclosed about Lieberâs
report in the Central Committee Bureau
Abroad?[6] 

Reply as soon as you can. The matter must be cleared up finally.

In a letter to A.Â I. Rykov dated MarchÂ 10, 1911 (see this volume,
DocumentÂ 220) Lenin refers to a copy of a letter from N.Â A. Semashko
(Alexandrov), a member of the C.C. Bureau Abroad. Lenin here is evidently
asking about the same letter.

Comrade Poletayev has forwarded to us through Lenin the plan for the
publication of the report of the Social-Democratic group which the group
discussed before Poletayevâs departure for Berlin.  

We on our part are fully in favour of the groupâs plan and suggest
agreement on the following final terms.  

We shall set up an Editorial Committee to publish the report consisting
of Steklov+Semashko+Zinoviev (or Kamenev).  

The committee shall undertake
(1) to draft a plan for the report and to negotiate with the group for its
approval;
(2) to apply to the Party for money, with the group contributing no
less than 500Â rubles;
(3) to do the final editing of the report (20Â signatures) by
(such-and-such) time.  

The answer to this suggestion should come from the group as a whole.


(Signatures of
Pokrovsky+Gegechkori)[1] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Evidently a suggestion that Pokrovsky and Gegechkori should sign the
official reply of the parliamentary group to the present letter.

Dear Comrade, 

The enclosed
letter[1]

is the formal result of the talks with Poletayev which I began in Berlin,
on instructions from the Duma group.  

With the agreement of the group, I have formed an Editorial Committee
consisting of Comrades Grigory (alternateâKamenev),

  Â  

Steklov and Alexandrov to publish the report.  

Since the group has undertaken to contribute no less than
500rubles to cover the expenses, and the total cost of publishing the
report has been estimated by us to run to 2,100â2,200 rubles, we propose
that the remaining 1,600 rubles be issued from the Party (âtrustâ)
funds[2] (and placed at the disposal of the Editorial Committee), to
which representatives of the Bolshevik trend are agreed.  

Lenin 

AprilÂ 30, 1911

[2]
Trust fundsâmoney belonging to the Bolsheviks held by
trustees. At the January 1910 (âUnityâ) plenary meeting of the C.C.,
R.S.D.L.P., held in Paris, an agreement was reached under which the
Bolsheviks dissolved their group and turned over its property (funds,
printing shop, etc.) to the Central Committee on condition that the other
groups likewise disband and pursue a single Party line directed against
liquidationism and otzovism. The funds were held in trust by the German
Social-Democrats Karl Kautsky, Franz Mehring and Clara Zetkin.

Dear Comrades, 

Your speeches in the Second Group on JulyÂ 1, 1911, which we have
already qualified as the worst repetition of the worst speeches of the
Economists,[2] and your âblocâ with the Poles (the worst of the
Poles) with a view to a new âplay of intrigueâ, and with the
Golos group (Lederâs
âwithdrawalâ),[3] and with Trotsky (âten invitationsâ), and with
the Vperyod group, and with the liquidators (violation of the
agreement which was accepted even by Igorev)âall this has made it fully
and finally clear to us that no political and moral unity is
possible between us. Since we have hitherto consulted with you on all
cardinal steps, we consider it our duty to inform you of this.  

At the last meeting Mark saw fit to say: âWe âconciliatorsâ shall
withdraw from the Technical Commission and the Organising Commission if you
Bolsheviks persist in pursuing a âfactionalâ policy.â  

We declare that we shall withdraw from the T.C. and the
O.C. if you continue your policy, which we consider extremely harmful for
the Party.  
 

We shall wait for your replyâif such is necessaryâuntil 11Â a.m. on
Wednesday, JulyÂ 5, 1911, at Kamenevâs, after which we will submit our
statement to the T.C. and the O.C. and will come out against you before the
Party.  

With Social-Democratic greetings,


N.Â Lenin[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The letter was also signed by G.Â Y. Zinoviev, L.Â B. Kamenev,
N.Â Alexandrov (N.Â A. Semashko) and Kamsky
(M.Â F. Vladimirsky).âEd.  
 



[2]
The R.S.D.L.P. Second Promotion Group in Paris formed on NovemberÂ 18
(new style), 1908, separated from the previous Paris group which had
included the Mensheviks as well. In 1911 the group included Lenin, Nadezhda
Krupskaya, N.Â A. Semashko, M.Â F. Vladimirsky, Inessa Armand and other
Bolsheviks; A.Â I. Lyubimov, M.Â K. Vladimirov and other conciliators, and
some Vperyod supporters.  

A meeting of the group held on JulyÂ 1 (new style), 1911, discussed the
situation in the Party, and adopted a resolution drafted by Lenin (see
present edition, Vol.Â 17, pp.Â 216â24) with a majority of 27Â votes. Ten
votes were cast for a conciliatory resolution submitted by the minority. It
is the conciliatory speeches of Lyubimov and Vladimirov at this meeting
that Lenin calls âthe worst repetition of the worst speeches of the
Economistsâ.





[3]
The âblocâ of the conciliators with the Polish
Social-Democrats (in the present letter the reference is to Tyszka and
Leder) was directed against the Bolsheviks. After the June 1911 conference
of members of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., abroad at the time, the conciliators
Lyubimov and Vladimirov, together with the Polish Social-Democrat

 Â  

Tyszka, challenged the composition of the Organising Commission Abroad, for
the convocation of the Party conference, seeking with the support of the
Polish Social-Democrats to win the majority in it for the conciliators.


The âplay of intrigueâ on the part of the conciliators and
the Polish Social-Democrats with the Golos group was expressed in
the support they gave to Martov and Dan, who had withdrawn from the
Editorial Board of the Central Organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, after the
June conference. The fifth member of the Editorial Board, Leder, issued an
ultimatum that he would âwithdrawâ unless two other Mensheviks were
brought in. The conciliators sided with the Polish Social-Democrats.

Dear L.Â B., 

I am sending you the
    proof-sheets.[1]


In Â§Â âTwo Partiesâ (especially in the end, pageÂ 86 in
fine[2]

âsee

separate sheet) changes are necessary.
(1) We must not call for a break with the conciliators. This is
quite uncalled for and incorrect. A âpersuasiveâ tone should be adopted
towards them, by no means should they be antagonised.
(2) The split should be discussed with more tact, always choosing
formulations to the effect that the liquidators have broken away, created
and proclaimed a âcomplete breakâ, and that the Party ought not to
tolerate them (âand the conciliators ought not to confuse issuesâ), and
so on.  

Thatâs how you put it mostly. But not always. Look through Â§Â âTwo
Partiesâ once again.  

We shall tone down the reply to the Germans. You are right in saying it
sounds rather sharp.  
 

Do not fail to send in the proofs of the Â§ on the conciliators.


All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

Two political emigrants, Nikita Pashev and Ivan Demidovsky, worked at
an airdrome in Kitil for a Mr.Â Cherkez. Mr.Â Cherkez dismissed his workers
without paying them the money due them. But with Nikita Pashev things
proved more complicated since he had been working on contract. Cherkez
wanted to get rid of N.Â Pashev, knowing that Nikita and Ivan, being
political emigrants, had to re main silent. He trumped up charges against
Nikita Pashev, claiming that he had removed some bolts from an
airplane. Nikita was detained, and Ivan probably as well. I know very well
that both (Nikita Pashev and Ivan Demidovsky), being political emigrants,
are incapable of anything of the kind. I would therefore ask you, dear
comrade, to intercede in the case, which may lead to the extradition of our
comrades. Please accept, dear comrade, my fraternal greetings.

 Representative of Russian Social-Democracy

Mr. Vl.Â Oulianoff. 6.

 Oakley Square. London. N.W.  

Cher camarade, 

I am sitting in the British Museum and reading with interest
Schweitzerâs pamphlets of the 60s; it is wonderful how they bear out the
opinion of him as an opportunist in the question of ways to unity!  

I obviously will not have the time to do everything need ed to
write about this. I would therefore ask you to go (or send a
reliable person) to the BibliothÃ©que Nationale without a dayâs
delay to find out what socialist literature of the 60s they have there. The
way to go about it is this:

write down all the most important titles (exact dates and places
of publication are important) and let them tell you what they

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

I am enclosing a letter Concerning the conference of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour
Party.[1]


I shall be very grateful to you if you print this letter in your next
circular so as to inform all the parties about our conference. I hope
nothing will prevent you from doing so, all the more as the circular has
not carried any official information about Russia for a long time now. I
shall be much obliged if you let me know when the circular is due to come
out.  

The Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party has
elected me representative of the R.S.D.L.P. in the International Socialist
Bureau.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin 

I am enclosing a copy of an official publication of the Central
Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour
       Party.[2]

5.4.Â 12 

Dear Citizen, 

I have received your Circular No.Â 5. I am enclosing an official
    communication[1]

which I would ask you to for ward to the secretaries of all the parties
duly affiliated with the International Association.  

I also have, dear citizen, a request to make in regard to your
introduction to Circular No.Â 5: would you be so kind as to explain to me a
point on which I am not quite clear. The thing is this. In the second
sentence of your introduction you put forward what I think is a fine
principle; you say that the secretariat is duty bound to pass on (to all
organisations) documents submitted by organisations duly affiliated
with the International Association, and by members of the
Bureau.... This is perfectly correct. But, dear citizen, do you not think
that the first sentence of your introduction, in which you say that you are
communicating to the parties affiliated with the Association a protest
resolution sent, as you so kindly informed me, by Citizen Babin, clearly
contradicts this principle? Does Babin represent an organisation duly
affiliated with the Association, and if so, what organisation? Or perhaps
Babin is a member of the Bureau? If he is, what organisation does he
represent? And what organisation affiliated with the Association is
responsible to the Bureau for the Paris resolution? I shall be boundlessly
grateful to you, dear citizen, if you dispel my doubts.  

With fraternal greetings,

 N.Â Lenin

Dear Citizen Huysmans, 

I fully agree with you, and, like yourself, believe that the Bureau
cannot act as a go-between in polemics. I also believe that the best and
only way to prevent this is to circulate only those documents which you
receive from the highest bodies of the parties represented in the Bureau
and which concern these parties. I was bound to inform you of the decisions
of our Party conference which reconstituted the Central Committee, which
our Party did not have at the moment, and I would not of course have
protested against the passing on of information emanating from an other
Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, but I
considered it my duty to protest against the circulation of polemics
between groups abroad.  

You also ask what I think of your draft appeal urging the convocation
of a joint conference. In my view this would not be advisable at the
moment, and since I do not pretend to be impartial, I take the liberty to
cite the opinion of the Poles (see VorwÃ¤rts). The Poles refused
to take part in our conference, but they also refused to participate in the
conference the Bund wants to call, declaring that it would be a conference
of liquidators. It is better to wait; let us see whether the liquidatorsâ
conference will take place and what it will do.  

I shall send you shortly some rather interesting documents which will
give you a better idea of the state of affairs in the Russian S.D.L.P.


Yours,
 N.Â Lenin

Werte Genossin, 

I do not know whether you have heard the sad news about our mutual
friend who introduced me to you in BerlinâSuren Spandaryan. He has been
arrested in Baku. His wife has written to his father that there is nobody
to help him; she says he has nothing, not even bedding. Nobody to take him
milk, etc. The father told me that he has many acquaintances in Baku and
that be had written to one of them. Why only to one, I do not
know.  

Spandaryanâs father lives here (Hotel Nicole, 19. Rue Pierre Nicole,
19. Paris). He looks very sick and old. His son bad promised to do his best
to send money to him from Bakuâbut couldnât do it because of the
arrest. The father is now penniless and is threatened with eviction. His
situation is most grievous, I would say desperate.  

We helped him with a small loan. But I nevertheless decided to write to
you. You probably know some of Spandaryanâs friends and acquaintances in
Baku and Paris. His father has on more than one occasion forgotten to
address letters he has mailed. Because of this I am very much afraid that
his letters will not reach Baku. Do you know anybody in Baku whom one could
write to about Suren and ask to take care of him?  

Furthermore, if you have mutual friends, it would be very necessary to
take care of the father as well. I have heard it said that he has a rich
son in Yekaterinodar. It would be a good thing if you were to write and
impress on him that he should send enough money to enable the old
man to pay his debts and leave from here.  

I hope you will do whatever you can for both Spandaryans and drop me a
line about it.  

How are you getting on? I have been hoping to hear from you. Have you
managed to look into Social-Democratic

  Â  

literature? Have you become a Social-Democrat and a Bolshevik?  

I wish you everything of the best 

Yours,
 Lenin 

Vl.Â Oulianoff.
 4. Rue Marie Rose. Paris. XIV.

Dear L.Â B., 

 ...[1]
I am surprised not to have had a single letter from you. It is essential
for us to correspond more regularly and especially for you to write more
often. âParis will run to seed,â everybody used to say. This is now your
responsibility, in other words, you must not allow that to happen. Get the
people together at least once a week, talk to them, organise them, see
Alexei daily and put some spirit into the group through him. You cannot
âabandon your ownâ to the mercy of fate. It will not do to disorganise
what has been (so far) the main centre. Remember, then, this is your
responsibility!! Convene the Committee of the Organisations Abroad, instil
new energy into it; while in Leipzig I heard complaints that the
C.O.A. (unlike the
      C.B.G.A.[2]

)

was doing nothing. And it is expected to supply leaflets (all
those put out in Paris), bulletins, letters.... Attend to this....  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Colleague, 

Received your parcel with files of Pravda and Nevskaya
     Zvezda.[1]

Will you please follow it up with the issues of the old Zvezda
which I am missing (you should have a list of these issues). If you do not
have the list of missing issues, let me know, and I shall send it at once.


I also received your detailed letter* concerning our co-operation. We
shall try to carry out as much as we can of this extremely broad
programme. But it must be underscored once again that it is absolutely
impossible to carry on without: 

(1) money. The office already owes 200 rubles, of which 100 rubles
should have been sent by June 1, old style, and 100 rubles by JuneÂ 15. The
debt must be paid without delay and the money sent punctually by the
stipulated dates, as agreed; 

(2) it is necessary to send new books, works of reference,
etc. Without new books it is impossible to carry out even
one-tenth of your co-operation programme. In my previous letter I gave you
a list of books and would ask you to let me know whether you can send them
all.  

Further, you ask in your letter âwhat other newspapers we should
sendâ. The list was sent you with the previous letter and I can only
repeat my request that you inform me by telegram: âpapers orderedâ;
otherwise there will be an interruption in the sending of
articles.  

We are making inquiries about Sinclairâs novel in Leipzig. But that is
a translation of the English. Or do you want to translate from the German
translation?  

At your service,

 V.Â Ulyanov 
 

P.S. As regards the agrarian question in particular, we
especially need current publicationsâgovernment and
Zemstvo. Print a notice without fail in the next issue that the
paper would like to receive all publications of the kind,
promising to publish a list of them as well as reviews of
the most important ones.  

Vl.Â Ulijanow. Zwierzyniec. L. 218. Oesterreich.

      Krakau.  


P.S. The newspaper Nevsky
Golos[6] is also badly needed (we do not have No.Â 4 or
later issues), as are all trade union
publications. Otherwise the section you want about the struggle between
labour and capital cannot be started.  


P.P.S. I cannot but draw your attention to some most unpleasant misprints
in the articles. I have just received (not from the editorial office or
from St.Â Petersburg at all) Nevskaya Zvezda No.Â 13. In the article
by a âNon-Liberal
      Scepticâ[2]

the word
   âispolzovatâ[3]

became
  âispovedovatâ[4]


Yet the handwriting of the author of the article is by no means
difficult to make out. More, it cannot but be familiar to the compositors
and the proof-reader. Lastly, the proof-reader should have easily caught
the mistake from the meaning.  

It is desirable to see to it that there should be fewer errors of
this kind.  

Pravda No.Â 43 has just been received in five copies as
promised. But I havenât got Nos.Â 41 and 42. Please
send five copies of each.

Pravda (The Truth)âa legal Bolshevik daily; first issue
appeared in St.Â Petersburg on AprilÂ 22 (MayÂ 5), 1912.  

The decision to put out a daily mass-circulation workersâ paper was
taken at the Sixth (Prague) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.  

Lenin gave ideological guidance to Pravda, wrote for it almost
daily, advised its editors. He wanted it to be a militant, revolutionary
organ.  

The paper was constantly hounded by the police, and on JulyÂ 8 (21),
1914, it was closed down.  

Publication was resumed only after the February bourgeois-democratic
revolution in 1917. On MarchÂ 5 (18), 1917, Pravda became the organ
of the Central and St.Â Petersburg Committees of the R.S.D.L.P.

Dear L.Â B., 

We sent you Nevskaya Zvezda No.Â 16 yesterday.  

We too were exasperated in the extreme by No.Â 6 of Nevsky
Golos and have already sent a letter of protest to Pravda. We
are writing some more today for No.Â 17 of Nevskaya
   Zvezda....[1]


âParty candidatesâ must not be mentioned in the legal press;
we can speak about them in C.Â C. leaflets and Rabochaya Gazeta.


Moving here has given us so far:
1) a gain of one day (closer);
2) the arrival of Abramchik (this is a secret). He is already here. It
seems he will help us at the frontier. And perhaps (this is still open to
question) also with the St.Â Petersburg elections;
3) the hope of arranging a number of meetings. For this
    two[2]

are already on their way. If they are not arrested, this will be
useful. But everything moves slowly and with one arrest after another.


As for the newspaper, this is what should be done: subscribe to
Russkiye
Vedomosti[3] for yourself (you take the R.V.
anyway) and send it to us 4â5 days later, a couple of times a week. We
shall pay for it. You canât get more out of Pravda, for its
circulation, they say, has fallen to 30,000 and things are hard....  

Send by postÂ ... the Vperyod [leaflet] (I havenât got it) and
all those put out in Paris. You must arrange without fail for the
publication of the [C.O.A.] bulletins (modest ones for the time being)
listing the Paris [leaflets] and giving a brief review of each.  

You promised to get something from Yuri about Plekhanovâs party
report. Nothing has been received so far. Send it!!  
 

And what did Plekhanov have to say about T. and Gerân?...  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Colleague, 

I am sending you the article âSome Results of Six Monthsâ
       Workâ.[1]

You will see from the contents why I have sent this huge article
to Pravda. You could run it in four successive feuilletons set up
in small type. Each of the four articles could have a separate heading (for
example:
I. Workersâ collections for the newspaper by months in 1912.
II. Workersâ collections for the newspaper by districts.
III.  Workersâ collections for liquidationist and
non-liquidationist newspapers.
IV. The workerâs kopek for the workersâ newspaper).  

I would very much like these articles, which are writ ten exclusively
for Pravda and addressed to its readers, to be published in
Pravda. I donât think there could be any censorship trouble. I
agree of course to make changes required by the censors, but not to
omit ChapterÂ III.  

If by any chance you should reject the article for Pravda, and
if your colleagues reject it for Nevskaya Zvezda (for which it is
far less suited), I shall get it published in one of the journals, however
much I should dislike to. At any rate, please reply as soon as possible or
send the article back to me here.  

Gylka sent me a letter the other day refusing to contribute to
Zvezda and Pravda in view of the âharmfulâ, if you
please, tendencies he discerned in No.Â 6 of Nevsky Golos and
Plekhanovâs âwithdrawalâ This is not the first

  Â  

time that this Gylka is switching over. If he should take it into his head
to raise a fuss about the publication of his article (although I couldnât
very well wire you his refusal!!), donât bother to answer him.  

Many thanks for the separate issues of âRightâ news papers. It is
extremely important for us to get such separate packages of interesting
papers, which we are altogether unable to obtain except through you.  

I was very glad to see in Pravda Y.Â K.âs item about
Sovremennik.[3] You ask for a greater variety of subjects. In
this respect Y.Â K. is valuable. The paper has no literary
criticismâreviews, essays or small paragraphs. In my opinion every
contributor should be valued for his own specific subject matter. Given a
slightly more attentive attitude on your part, Y.Â K. could no doubt
contribute a bigger variety of items which would greatly enliven the
workersâ newspaper.  

Why did you kill my article on the Italian
      congress?[2]

In general it wouldnât be a bad thing to inform authors about rejected
articles. This is not an excessive request. To write âfor the waste-paper
basketâ, i.e., articles to be thrown out, is not very
pleasant. Unpublished articles should be returned. Any
contributor, even to a bourgeois newspaper, would demand this.  

With comradely greetings,

 V.Â Ulyanov 

Please write Wiener
âArbeiter-Zeitungâ[4] to send the exchange copy to
me (give them my address). You wouldnât be allowed to get it
anyhow. Donât forget to write!!

Dear L.Â B., 

First of all hearty greetings to all friends, thanks for the telegram
and heaps of best wishes! (Never mind the blot.) Salut, salut Ã 
vous.. Ah, Iâd give a lot to hear MontÃ©gus now.  

But Iâve gone off the âseriousâ key.  

And thereâs âbusinessâ to discuss.  

(1) I am enclosing our reply to the German
      Vorstand.[1]

Show it to a narrow circle+the Committee of the Organisations Abroad and
return.  

(2) A letter from Zaks for you. Read it, go into it,
reply and return....  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 


Morozov is talking
    nonsense....[2]

A young man without allegiances, at loose ends.  

Ryazanov in Vienna snaps and sulksâfound himself looking foolish
after Plekhanovâs article in Pravda. (I wrote a long,
heart-melting letter to Kiselyov. I donât think anything will come
of it.)  

Lunacharsky writes in Kievskaya
Mysl[3] about âscientific mysticismâ. Get hold of it and give
him a public fatherly trouncing.  

Why donât you write something for
Prosveshcheniye?[4]

government. Publication was resumed in the autumn of 1917, but only one

Dear L.Â B., 

I am sending you a letter from Vera. You will see from it why we
decided to print the reply to the Germans for Chemnitz and to
print it in
Leipzig.[2] The Paris order must therefore be cancelled. I hope work on
it has not yet been started and the cancellation will not cause any great
inconvenience.  

You must get without fail to Chemnitz a day or two in
advance. We shall give a credential from Rabochaya Gazeta to a
Bolshevik here who will go there from Zakopane. He speaks German.  


# See plan



Thereâs a serious war ahead of you in Chemnitz.  

||
We shall move to a new flat on SeptemberÂ 2.  The new address: Ulica
Lubomirskiego. 47, au premier, Ã  gauche.  (Grigory is at No.Â 35 in the
same street.)  

[INSERT GRAPHIC JPEG JPG jpg HERE. Street map.]  

Write whether you are sure to be in Chemnitz on the 12th or
13th of September. The reply to the Germans will have to be sent to your
name
     postlagernd[1]

in Chemnitz.  

Best wishes,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

Peuple (Brussels) reprints from Russkoye
Slovo[3] that a conference will soon take place in Vienna
(sic!) of Social-Democratic organisations+the Bund+the Letts+the Poles,
etc.!!!  
 


[[

Drop in at the Paris group a couple of times and give them a talk. For they
have been left to their own devices....

P.S. If an announcement of the liquidatorsâ conference comes out, send
it over express.

Dear L.Â B., 

I received today from Trotsky an invitation to âtheirâ conference (on
AugustÂ 25).[2] 

So they have organised it after all!  

We, of course, are not going.  

We want to have the Central Organ two-thirds ready, so as to issue a
      replyÂ ...[1]
as soon as their announcement comes out.  

We shall begin sending in copy to the C.O. tomorrow.  

See to it that the material is set up quickly and proofs corrected
properly.  

Why doesnât Antonov (Britman) answer me? Is he in Paris? In good
health?  

Write when you propose to set out for Chemnitz. A paper should be
prepared for the Germans in advance.  

Why do you return the lettersÂ ... and donât give us an answer about the
Pannekoek article....  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear L.Â B., 

Can you get Neue Zeit, the latest issues, with the Pannekoek
and Kautsky articles? If not, write, and weâll send them over. It is
necessary to read them before going to Chemnitz and there to look up
Pannekoek and make closer contact with him: Kautsky replied to him on some
cardinal issues in an extremely opportunist way. It is very
desirable to make closer contact with the Left (especially Pannekoek, who
now lends a hand in the cheap âgameâ played by Tyszka) and to carry on
agitation among them for a principled rebuff to Kautsky. Itâll be
disgraceful if they do not revolt against such opportunism!
Unfortunately they are short of people:
Radek is practically a luminary among
       them....[1]


You ought to write popular articles (in the tone of
Rabochaya Gazeta), literary criticism, for Pravda. If you
write in the Rabochaya Gazeta toneÂ ... theyâll print
them. OtherwiseÂ ... a bad job! Dnevnitsky has left and we are now without a
literary criticism section in Zvezda!! and Pravda also
needs one.  

Have you got
Zavety?[5] Can you send me Ropshin for a time?  I should like
to write about him for the C.O.  

Are you writing for Prosveshcheniye? Make haste!  

(I read in a German paper that there is a
housing shortage in Chemnitz and that one has to apply in advance to the
      Wohnungsausschu&Bwhatthe[2]

â(Faites
     attention![3]

).)



All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. And so, after Chemnitz, you must come to us. Câest
     entendu,[4]
unless... circumstances compel us to invite

  Â  

you here before Chemnitz. Let us know in advance whether you are going to
Switzerland, when, where, and for how long.

interest. Return it.

For your information. The report of a Lettish delegate passed on by a
Lett, a student in the Lettish group. The general impression, it appears,
even of all the conciliators, isâa complete fiasco for
the liquidators.  

Write whether you received the pamphlet and what the beginning
of the congress was like.

Dear L.Â B., 

I am sending you a copy of our reply to Muller (Albert will send the
reply from Leipzig tomorrow).  

Albert will also send you our reply in the form of a printed
leaflet. (Postskriptum to the pamphlet Zur gegenwÃ¤rtigen
Sachlage,
 etc.[1]

)

Circulate this leaflet, as well as the

  Â  

pamphlet, as widely as possible. It must be impressed upon the Germans that
before any materials (of the liquidatorsâ conference) appear in
the press and before verification in open discussion in
the press, not a single word can be believed.  

We hear from Berlin that the liquidators have met with a
fiasco. Incidentally, Alexinsky left their conference and
threatens exposures.  

Write as soon as possible how things are going.  

Yours,
 Lenin 

Postskriptum zu der Schrift

Zur gegenwÃ¤rtigen Sachlage. etc.
   

   VertraulichÂ ...[2]
an die Delegierte des... zum Chemnitzer
   Parteitag.[3]


Today, SeptemberÂ 15, we received through Paris the following letter
from the Vorstand which shows the German comrades most strikingly how right
we were in protesting against private, unauthorised âinformantsâ who
fear to come out openly. The Vorstand writes on SeptemberÂ 10: 

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  

We replied to the Vorstand.  

It goes without saying that the Vorstandâs information is false, that
it is a sheer invention by the liquidators.  

We can say with certainty that this fable was given to the Vorstand by
the Letts, Bundists or the Trotzky-Leute who
recently held âtheir ownâ conference, which they call a Party conference,
but which in reality was a conference of liquidators.  

So as not to make unsubstantiated statements, so as not to quote our
organisational correspondence, we shall

  Â  

confine ourselves to adducing only one printed document openly published in
St.Â Petersburg. (The Vorstand would do well to cease once and for all to
take things on faith.)  

The St.Â Petersburg Marxist daily Pravda printed in its issue
No.Â 102, AugustÂ 28 (SeptemberÂ 10, new style), a letter from one of the
biggest factories in Kharkov specifically about the elections. The letter
states clearly and plainly that the âliquidator candidatesâ were ânot
announcedâ and that they, the liquidators, âdeny the need for a
workersâ partyâ (Pravda No.Â 102, p.Â 4, col.Â 1).  

From this alone the German comrades can see how shamelessly the Letts,
the Bund, Trotsky and sundry private âinformantsâ are deceiving them.


It is clearly a matter of enabling the same Trotsky, the Bund, the
Letts or the Caucasians to lay hands on the money on behalf of
     angeblichen[4]

âorganisationsâ, whose existence neither the Vorstand nor anyone else can
prove or verify.  

Surely the German party with its 90 Social-Democratic newspapers
canâif it does not want to put itself in an awkward position by
blundering in serious mattersâopen a discussion on the question of the
Social-Democratic Party in Russia and induce all theÂ ... informants to come
out into the open with documents bearing their signature. Russia is after
all not central Africa, and the German Social-Democratic workers would be
able without much difficulty to grasp the truth and at the same time
certain members of the Vorstand would be relieved of the necessity of
listening to private and unverifiable tales.

Dear L.Â B., 

Congratulations on your
       speech.[1]


Dash it all, itâs disgusting: the Vorstand will give
permission to
  âcirculateâ....[2]


I am sending the article I wrote for Bremer BÃ¼rger-Zeitung
with Maleckiâs
translation.[3] I decided to send it to you when I learned that you had
met Pannekoek. It would be best if you personally gave him the
article and discussed it with him. I give you the right to make cuts and
changes but bear in mind that I do not agree to being simply
âfor
Radekâ.[4] If they do not want to hear out my whole statement
(against Rosa and for our Party), then to hell with them.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

Write details about Axelrod and all the Test. (We published in Leipzig
a leaflet with our answer to the Vorstand. Wire or telephone Albert to let
you have it all immediately if you havenât received it yet.)  

The Vorstand of course will forbid it. Arrange it privately and
circulate it without fail.

Bremer BÃ¼rger-Zeitungâa Social-Democratic daily published
from 1890 to 1919. Until 1916 it was under the influence of the Bremen Left
Social-Democrats and then was taken over by the social-chauvinists.  

The article referred to has not been found.





[4]
A reference to charges of unethical behaviour made against Karl Radek
in an inquiry organised by the Chief Executive of the Social-Democratic
Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania.  By decision of the board of
inquiry, Radek was expelled from the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and
Lithuania and the Social-Democratic Party of Germany.  


In early September 1913 a commission was set up in Paris on the
initiative of the Bureau of the Sections Abroad of the Social-Democratic
Party of Poland and Lithuania (Rozlamists) to review the decision.  

Lenin supported the review of the Radek case, believing that the
charges laid by the Chief Executive stemmed from the acute struggle it was
waging against the Rozlamists.  

The commission worked for five months and arrived at the conclusion
that there were no grounds for the party trial of Radek and his expulsion
from the party, and recommended that Radek be considered a member of the
Social-Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania and of the
R.S.D.L.P. (see the pamphlet Sprawozdanie komisji badaj&acedilce
jspraw&etail czlonka S.D.K.P.i.L.  Karola RadkaâReport of the
Commission Investigating the Case of S.D.P.K.P.L. Member Karl
Radekâpublished in March 1914 by the Bureau of the Sections Abroad of the
Social-Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania).  

For background information on the differences between the Chief
Executive and the Rozlamists see Leninâs article âThe Split Among the
Polish Social-Democratsâ (present edition, Vol.Â 18, pp.Â 479â84).

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

I am enclosing a communication from the Warsaw Committee of the Polish
Social-Democratic Party. This committee has asked me to forward to you the
communication which conclusively proves that the charges against the Warsaw
Committee lodged with the International Socialist Bureau by the Central
Committee of the Polish Social-Democratic Party are completely false.  

I would be very grateful, dear comrade, if you would bring this
important document to the attention of the secretaries of all the parties
represented in the Bureau.

Dear Colleague, 

I was very happy to receive one of your rare letters. Many, many thanks
for the subscriptions to the journals. I can send you the book by Litvinov
whenever you want it. I do not recall a book by Chistyakov. What is it
about, what sort of a book is
it?[1] Your hopes that I am sufficiently well informed are, alas,
entirely unfounded. In fact, to me it sounds almost like mockery.... Of
course I quite under stand your reference to the âhurry-scurryâ, but a
political hurry-scurry, you know, seldom takes the form of silence or
reserve. As a contributor to Pravda on political questions I too
experience the âhurry-scurryâ and that is why I cannot

  Â  

remain silent even when the circumstances are not at all conducive to
conversation (owing to the silence of the interlocutor). In my view it
would be extremely important before the elections on
OctoberÂ 17[2] to set forth still more clearly and resolutely the basic
principles of the anti-liquidationist platform, to print our own list once
more in full, to warn against vacillation Ã Â la
Sudakov[3] (strange, very strange that you say nothing on this
score). I am sending article after article about this. Knock and it shall
be opened unto you.... Is this applicable to your newspaper? It would be
advisable to put out an extra sheet on these questions on Wednesday. It
would cost some 100â200 rublesâbut even that sum would be repaid tenfold
by the success of the election campaign, for what we need are re liable and
lasting friends, do not forget that. Donât stint 100â200 rubles at the
decisive moment, you will economise far more in the long run.... As regards
the technicalities, it is important to give some attention to curbing the
chair man of the congress of representatives. I would advise consulting
lawyers by telephone and writing an article about the rights of members of
the congress of representatives vis-Ã -vis the chairman. I do not have the
law at the moment (Legal Code, Vol.Â II, 1892 edition, articles 179â91,
general gubernia institutions), in any case the lawyers ought to know and
will give clear practical advice on how to file complaints against the
chairman and secure oneâs rights. Donât grudge the expense of wiring me the
election results.  

N.Â L.

P.Â I. Sudakov, a worker, was elected at the first congress of
delegates of the workers of St.Â Petersburg Gubernia held on OctoberÂ 5 (18),
1912, thanks to the vote of Pravda supporters. On OctoberÂ 6 (19)
he wrote an item entitled âAt the Meeting of Delegatesâ (Pravda
No.Â 136) in which he declared himself a supporter of Pravda and
Zvezda. On the following day, OctoberÂ 7 (20), Luch No.Â 19
carried a letter to the Editor from Sudakov in which he went back on the
statement he had made in Pravda. For more about the Sudakov
incident see Leninâs âOn Political Spinelessness (Letter to the Editor)â,

I had hardly posted my previous letter when I received yours about the
library. The plan to collect material on the history of the revolution is
magnificent. I welcome it with all my heart and wish it success.  
 

As for Bebutov, he told me when I met him in May in Berlin that he had
given the library to the Vorstand (the C.C. of the German Social-Democrats)
in such a way that he could not take it back. I have his
letter saying that this library was to be donated to the Social-Democratic
Party when it was united, etc. Iâm afraid that means thereâs nothing to be
done. But all the same you ought to try to get in touch with
Bebutov.  

Vl.Â Ilyin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A typewritten copy of the present letter verified by Maxim Gorky was
preserved among the personal papers of V.Â A. Desnitsky. It was written in
reply to a project sent by Gorky for the collection of material on the
history of the revolution. Gorky wrote about this project to
V.Â V. Veresayev on OctoberÂ 8 (New Style), 1912 (Maxim Gorky, Collected
Works, 30âvolume Russian edition, Vol.Â 29, p.Â 255).  


Gorky proposed to acquire for a museum the library and archives
collected by Prince I.Â D. Bebutov, a Social-Democratic sympathiser. Bebutov
had willed the collection to the R.S.D.L.P. and turned it over for
safekeeping to the Executive (C.C.) of the German Social-Democratic
Party. Through the editor of the St.Â Petersburg journal
Sovremennik, Gorky got in touch with Bebutov, who replied that he
did not object to his library being transferred to a reliable institution,
but the final decision was left until a personal meeting.  

What happened afterwards to the Bebutov library is not known.

Friday 

Dear L.Â B., 

Please hurry up and put out the C.O.  

We are annoyed with you for your silence. You didnât write from
Vienna. You didnât convey a message of greetings to the Austrian
congress.[2] Thatâs no good. You didnât write from Zurich!!  

In Warsaw Jagiello got
in.[3] We donât know yet about Moscow 

All the best,

[3]
Y.Â I. Jagiello, a member of the Polish Socialist Party
(P.P.S.), was elected to the Fourth Duma from Warsaw. The Bolsheviks were
strongly against his admission into the Social-Democratic Duma group since
he had been elected with the support of the bourgeoisie and the bloc of the
P.P.S. and the Bund. By a majority of one vote (the decisive vote was cast
by a Menshevik) he was nevertheless admitted, but under pressure from the
Bolshevik deputies his rights in the group were limited; on all inner-Party
questions he was given voice but no vote. For details see Leninâs article
âThe Working Class and Its âParliamentaryâ Representativesâ, and the
resolution of the Cracow conference of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. with Party
functionaries, âThe Social-Democratic Group in the Dumaâ (present

10.XI.  

Dear L.Â B., 

I have just learned that the congress in Basle will take place, in
all probability, on
November24.[2] For the resolutions committee we are
appointing one delegate (+one each from France, Germany, Austria and
Britain+Chairman Vandervelde,
      4.Â Rue...[1]

XIV. Bruxelles). Keep the address.  

It is possible that I shall not go and that we shall
appoint you. So begin to prepare at once: collect all
the manifestos against war, get the last issue of Neue Zeit
(No.Â 6, 8.Â XI) where Kautsky advances purely opportunistic arguments,
etc.Â ...[3] 

Leave on receipt of a wire (to be in Basle one or two days
before the congress opens, i.e., on 22 or 23.Â XI).  

Put out the C.O. (8Â pages) at once.  

Write what and how much is left for the next issue (4Â pages) which we
shall put out shortly. Malinovsky got in in Moscow Gubernia.  

Saluts et fÃ©licitations!

    Bien Ã  vous,

      Vl.Â Lenin

A reference to the Extraordinary Socialist Congress of the Second
International in Basle on November 24â25 (N.Â S.), 1912, called to
examine the question of struggle against the imminent danger of an
imperialist world war, which had been further heightened by the outbreak of
the first Balkan war. The congress was attended by 555Â delegates. The C.C.,
R.S.D.L.P. sent six delegates.  

At its meeting on NovemberÂ 25 the Congress unanimously adopted a
manifesto against war.  

In the event of an imperialist war, the manifesto recommended
socialists to make use of the economic and political crisis caused by the
war to fight for the socialist revolution.  

When the First World War broke out, the leaders of the Second
International ignored the Basle manifesto and sided with their imperialist
governments.

10.XI.  

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

I am very grateful to you for your
communication.[1] We shall try to take steps to appoint delegates to
the Basle Congress.  
 

Our Partyâs representative in the committee to edit the draft
resolution will be named at the earliest possible date.  

With fraternal greetings,

 N.Â Lenin 

P.S. I must submit to the C.C. of our Party a report on the last
session of the Bureau. To draw up the report I need some information. I
know very well that you are extremely busy, dear comrade, and would ask you
to give five or ten minutes of your time to Comrade Popov, who will call on
you. The French and German newspapers (LeÂ Peuple, Wiener
Arbeiter-Zeitung, Bremer BÃ¼rger-Zeitung, Leipziger
Volkszeitung and VorwÃ¤rts) published very contradictory
information on the last session of the
I.S.B.[2] 

P.P.S. I received the news of the election of deputies to the Fourth
Duma from Moscow Gubernia only today. I can now report that all the
deputies from the workersâ curia (Arbeiterkurie) are
Social-Democrats! Twelve Social-Democrats have already been
elected despite the most outrageous rigging of the elections.  

With fraternal greetings,

 N.Â Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Huysmans had written Lenin on NovemberÂ 7, 1912, letting him know when
the Basle congress was to open and asking him to

 Â  

attend to the appointment of delegates; informing him of the demonstrations
expected to take place in the big European cities on NovemberÂ 17, 1912,
against the extension of the theatre of hostilities; asking him to agree to
speak at a meeting if invited to do so by any of the parties; informing him
of the composition of the resolution committee of the congress, and asking
that a representative be appointed to the committee.

A reference to the meeting of the International Socialist Bureau held
in Brussels on October 28â29, 1912, which Lenin did not attend. The
meeting decided to call an extraordinary socialist congress. Russia was
represented by G.Â Plekhanov and I.Â Rubanovich. A special closed sitting was
held to discuss Russian affairs, but no official report of the sitting was
published. Lenin learnt of it from L.Â Martovâs article âThe International
Bureau on Social-Democratic Unityâ, published in Luch No.Â 37,
OctoberÂ 28, 1912. Lenin replied to Martov in his article âBetter Late Than
Neverâ (see present edition, Vol.Â 18, pp.Â 469â70).

The committee has been appointed for Saturday, 26.XI at 10Â a.m. in the
Burgvogtenhalle. Be there at 9.45 so as to see Huysmans and
Plekhanov (I have written to both about

  Â  

 you[1]

).

No later! Better earlier so as to arrange everything.  

You are the national secretary. No one but you and Plekhanov has
the right to receive admission cards.  

Since I wrote about you to Huysmans (I gave him your official
nameâKameneffâand also your address and real name), there is
no need to show your mandate.  

Get Malecki at least to come as your
    supplÃ©ant,[2]

but let him not take the floor when you are there and speak
only on Polish questions. Mention this only to Huysmans.  

I am sending two mandates for the delegationâtake your choice.  

A detailed letter on the tasks of the delegation, votes, and the rest
has been sent to Troyanovsky for forwarding to Yuri
(Bekzadian. Bolleystra&Bwhatthee. 4.Â Zurich).  

We cursed you roundly for your silence, but now peace!  

Ask Rubanovich when you have a chance whether Plekhanov spoke about
uniting with the Socialist-Revolutionaries.  

Yours,
 Lenin 

For the trip: 40Â frs. per lecture+50. The Committee of the
Organisations Abroad is defraying the expense.

Dear L.Â B., 

...[1]
Two of our latest documents are to be sent to you in Basle from Brussels
(by Popov) [and from LeipzigÂ ] (by Zagorsky): my Rapport [to the I.S.B.Â ]
on the elections

  Â  

to the Fourth Duma and âRussian Workers Against
Warâ[2]

...

strikes and the resolution of the representatives. All this should be
circulated in [the I.S.B. This] is important...  

Yours,
 Lenin 

P.S. ...Prepare in a businesslike way. This makes an on all of
them. Say that the whole world measures the strength of
Social-Democracy by three tokens:
1) the numberÂ ... of
       votants[3]

(in Russia, not; a couple of words against the legalists);
2) the socialist press;
3) socialist deputies. [Should we go by the] legal press?  


How many times stronger have we (Pravda) been than
Luch[5] throughout 1912 (ten months,
January-October)?  (Ad.Â 3. Begin with the Third Duma) âDer
Anonymus aus dem VorwÃ¤rtsâ
       u.s.w.[4]

The worker curia in the Fourth Duma (two words about it) is ours.

Dear L.Â B., 

I am furious with you for your carelessness: you did not arrange for
letters from the congress!! But of that another time. You made Koba lose
most precious time.  
 

Now to the point. In my opinion you handled things in Basleâunder the
circumstancesâsuperbly. It couldnât have been done better. There couldnât
have been a better occasion to unmask the liquidators. (I
gatheredâfor you âhavenât finishedâ your letter yet!âthat the
I.S.B. did not examine at all the division of votes). The
outcome was a tie, and this was the best outcome with the present
balance of
     strength....[1]

The question of the ânationalsâ was, in my opinion, in place,
like all the three questions. In a word, as regards the main
thingâfÃ©licitations les plus chaleureuses!  

Why was Muranovâs signature missing? For the telegram was on
Sunday!![2] 

So far we have seen two of the six: Malinovsky and Muranov. Impression
excellent.... The soil is rich, but a great deal of work is
needed....  


P.S. In my opinion, parity can be agreed to, but you must put forward one
condition: rejection of Haase because of bias and insulting
behaviour in the Bureau.  

It is our legitimate right and moral duty to reject his candidacy. And
politically it is clear... hatching a malicious intrigue against us....

You had five aides and not a single letter from Basle to
us!!ânot a single dispatch to Pravda!!  

And why didnât you give mandates to the âgirlsâ (all those

Dear Comrade, 

I hasten to inform you that I received your letter of NovemberÂ 15,
1912. The address evidently functions wellâyou can continue to use it. We
were greatly upset by your temporary withdrawal from Pravda and
are very glad that you have returned. Communication with Pravda
staff has been very unsatisfactory lately, especially after the unfortunate
developments of the past few
days.[1] This is very painful. We would be very pleased if, now that
you have tested the address and seen that your letter has reached us, you
would write more about yourself, about the present Editorial Board of
Pravda, about how Pravda is run, about its opponents,
about Luch, and so on.  

What is the need for confirmation through the Editorial Board of
Pravda? I do not understand.  

Greetings and best wishes from myself and my colleague.  

V.Â Ilyin

Dear L.Â B., 

I shall reply point by point.  

1) About Haaseâs letter to Ryazanov. This âdocumentâ is private. We
do not have it. We cannot refer to it. For us to ask
Haase (if only through the I.S.B.) for an âexplanationâ is awkward, very
awkward.  

Your question whether âhe (Haase) was given (by whom?) an opportunity
to âexplain thingsââ isirrelevant.  

He always had and still has an opportunity. He has even been
told as much by Ryazanov. Ergo, he does not want to, And to the
devil with him! But we will corner him and all the Germans,
because now we have a document stating that the Vorstand gave money to the
Letts+the Bund+the Caucasian region.  

2) Your question if we âhave someone better in view is forgive me,
very strange. And stranger still: âhe (Haase) at least knows somethingâ
(??) (le prÃ©jugÃ© est plus Ã©loignÃ© de la vÃ©ritÃ© que
     lâignorance![1]

)

and âhe is capable (?) of under standing (??) the price (???) of
ideological (????) differencesâ.... Really, this is strange. He cannot
understand who does not want to. And the German Vorstand (with
Haase, its head) has demonstrated that it does not want to.  

We are not looking for anyone âbetterâ, we cannot and are not obliged
to look. That is not the point. It is only necessary to reject what is
deliberately âpartialâ. The rest does not matter.  

3) What is this about the âendorsement of the mandates of the
oppositionâ in Basle? Arenât you ashamed of yourself for not having
written a word about this to this day??  

Who âendorsedâ? The Russians? The Social-Democrats +the
Socialist-Revolutionaries?? Who permitted them to interfere? How could the
Russians interfere without getting the whole Polish
delegation to cast its vote as laid down in the rules of the International?
Did the whole Polish delegation vote or not? If it did, we
need at any rate (besides

  Â  

your account) a document signed by all the delegates who
did the âendorsingâ. How could you, who have been here and know how acute
the problem of the opposition is, have failed to realise the importance of
such a document in a matter of this kind in general, and that for us in
Cracow it is doubly important??  

4) If Muranovâs signature was there, drop a line
      [pleaseÂ ][2]

to Huysmans saying that there was a misprint or an omission in the reports
and that you kindly ask him to make a correction in the official report, to
insert Muranov, that you are referring to such-and-such a document,
reminding him, etc.  

5) You are going to write for the C.O. on the elections and on Basle,
arenât you? As regards the elections, read Steklovâs vile article in
Neue Zeit and bear it in mind, without, of course, replying to
him.  

Hand in the article about Basle to the printers as quickly as you can
and send us the proofs as soon as possible; for we have to discuss the
matter: there are a number of important questions (how to write about
Plekhanov? and about the Polish opposition?). In my opinion, you should
make it sharply-worded. But there is no collective decision on this as yet,
nor can there be without our article.  

6) Honestly, L.Â B., I simply cannot understand youâalthough we have
been working together so longâwhen you now begin making âdomestic
scenesâ about
(a) the trip to Basle,
(b) delegating you (as was proposed) to the meeting.  

Why such a tone!? How can you take such an attitude?? Arenât you
ashamed to raise questions?  

What was so bad for the cause about your trip to Basle?
Explain, for Godâs sake!  

How you can repeat the pointless whining of Yuri and the Kiev
people is in-com-pre-hensible!  

What was so bad for you? Explain!  

Now, about the meeting. I must
(a) drop my daily work for Pravda;
(b) spend twice or three times as much time as you would;
(c) spend twice or three times as much moneyâand
  Â  

there is no money;
(d) walk into the trap prepared by our enemies who want to make the most of
my maximum (how else could it be the way the war is going)
irritation??  

Tell me, for Godâs sake, whatâs come over you?? Why, if you wrote the pamphlet, should I have
to go??  

...âIt will at once make the whole thing look ridiculousâ!? What does
this mean?? Why did Martynovâs being with you in Basle not make
things âlook ridiculousâ?? Why do you allow yourself to
be taken in by the old wivesâ tales of the Paris scandalmongers??  

...âIt will at once tip the scales in favour of the O.C.â  ...Now,
really, that is being a little too naÃ¯ve. Since the Germans are
against us (and that is a fact) the âscalesâ have already tipped
in favour of the O.C. How can you fail to see this?? My presence would only
make things ten times worse, for I am incapable of
talking peaceably (like you) either with Haase or about Haase. You know
this perfectly well!  

The point however is that it is not these âscalesâ, i.e., in
the Bureau, at the meeting, that are seriously decisive,
it is the real alignment of forces that counts. We have 6Â curia workers in the Social-Democratic Duma group on
the Jagiello questionâ6 and 6; Malinovsky writes me today: âwe have
6Â curia deputies+4 liquidators+2 wavering. The Siberians have not
yet arrived.â  

We shall mobilise the six representing the proletariat of
Petersburg, Moscow and the South and fight the
gossip and intrigues of Tyszka+Rosa+Ryazanov and others.... There you have
the serious âscalesâ! And you know it! Why stage these
âdomestic scenesâ when the fight is hard enough as it is??  

âThe Germans will take offenceÂ ... get angryâ.... This has
already happened. And we shall send a protest about the
Germans giving the money to the O.C. Let them get angry. They are already
involved. We must inevitably fight with the Germans and
began to do so with
(a) the âAnonymusâ+=
(b) Chemnitz. Haase ârepliedâ in Chemnitz. The war is
on, and you wax naive: theyâll get angry, theyâll take offence. I
donât understand you!  

I am thinking of replying to the Bureauâs proposals thus:
(a) we shall turn down all the Germans for handing

  Â  

the money to the Bund and the Caucasus;
(b) we shall go to the meeting only with the expelled group of
liquidators without the nationals;
(c) preliminary conditionâformal disavowal by them of the vile slander in
Luch about the provocation in Warsaw. The motives are clear. Your
opinion?  

Reply more precisely, more directly, more resolutely. I shall go
nowhere; if you carry the âscenesâ to the point of refusal, I
shall get Semashko delegated
or....[3]

Is that what you want? Once again: were you right with your
âapprehensionsâ about Basle? or was I right that no harm was done to the
cause, but that both the cause and the pocket benefited?


7) The money crisis is serious. We had a meeting of the
C.C. with
Koba.[4] It was decided to warn you urgently:
look for earnings! You can count on 100Â frs. monthly for about
three months+from Pravda for what you write, but after that
nothing.  

Think this over and let us have your answer as soon as possible.  

Yours,
 Lenin 


P.S. From Pravda they write us: Alexinsky and Co. (sic!) have
offered articles on condition that their articles the editors do not agree
with be published.  

They replied: we would be glad to have your contributions, but cannot
accept such a condition, for our task now is to concentrate the forces of
the anti-liquidators to combat the liquidators.  

A splendid answer and perfectly correct, in my opinion.  

Bear this in mind! What do Alexinsky and Co. want? (What Co.?
Lunacharsky alone, or someone else? And who?) Is it just
an intrigue, as I think (Luch, you see, is kinder, while
Pravda turned me down, etc.), or an overture, as Grigory believes?
You meet... or see..., check up, find out what you can, and write.  
 

About the Duma group: there is a letter (not to us, but a reliable
letter) saying that the voting on cultural-national autonomy went
against the liquidators+Chkheidze. This is the only fact we
know of pointing to the emergence of our majority among theÂ 12. That is all
we know so far. As soon as we know more we shall write.

14/XII.  

Dear Friend, 

We learned today that the board of the
co-operative[4] is, to be dissolved within a week. There is therefore
very little time left. We earnestly ask you to take all steps to:
1) transfer
Dyen[5] in good time to
No.Â 5,[6] or at any rate make certain, concretely and with full
guarantees, that the funds are in his hands. The financial crisis is
terribly acute. Subscription money is now all we have. To leave this in
unreliable hands would be a crime!
2) It is necessary at once to prepare (or to take those already prepared by
us and sent long ago) articles and statements by the six co-operators for
Dyen and publish them without delay. If we do not launch an
energetic campaign for subscriptions, for donations, for support, we are
lost.
3) Get Mishaâs
collegium[7] to pass a resolution against
       No.Â 16,[1]

to counteract the liquidatorsâ resolutions.
4) See to it that the gathering of all (without exception) which has been
finally decided upon is heldâthis is now trebly important. We are
dragging Spitsa in too.
5) Get Vasilyev out as soon as possible, otherwise you wonât be able to
save him, and he is needed and has already accomplished the main thing.

 

Please reply to this letter as soon as possible and especially about
   Pravda.[2]

You wrote that âit smacks of a criminal
actâ.[8] We shall be finished if we do not turn over the whole
business (i.e., the publishing and the funds) to No.Â 5.  

Best regards,


       Yours,[3]
 


P.S. The trip is possible only if undertaken immediately, if passports are
obtained for everybody at once, without delay, if you see to it that there
should be action, not promises. If it is postponed, they will all scatter
and nothing will come of it. It is extremely important to get everyone to
take part simultaneously, for otherwise again there will be no decisions,
no organisation, only promises, only talk.  


P.P.S. You must do your best to put off the question of No.Â 16 until 1913,
many after all do not know the Party documents, and without them
it would be wrong for people to decide such a question.

16/XII.  

Dear Friend, 

We received all your letters (the last about the âtractabilityâ of
your
     compatriot[1]

regarding No.Â 16.... Question able, though!) and are replying. Is it
possible that our letters go astray?  
 

1) For goodnessâ sake, take the most energetic steps to get
  W.[2]

away from Krass and turn it over legally to Muranov, No.Â 5, and
particularly to take the funds and the subscription money. Without this we
are lost. Besides to allow the abuses to go on would be criminal.  

2) Arrange a meeting over there of all six before they have time to
scatter. There is plenty of time now; they will manage to do everything
after the meeting as well.  

3) Be sure to get the six to publish a statement in W. (even the five,
at a pinch; we cannot delay any longer and wait).  

4) Impress it finally and seriously upon
      Shibayev[3]

and all his colleagues that they must write here twice a week and
correspond conscientiously. Without this it is impossible to work
together.  

5) The same applies to Vetrov. He has not written once, and he could
easily have sent even the text of the liquidatorsâ declaration. This is
inexcusable.  

6) Did you get the draft resolutions for Mishaâs collegium? Do your
level best to get them adopted.  

The letters were sent mainly to the bank address. The draft leaflet, to
the other, Shibayev address. Reply at once, if only in a few words, to
acknowledge receipt of this letter.  

Greetings  


P.S. Just learned of the defeat.  

You must get Mishaâs collegium to adopt a resolution against
(the one No.Â 3 had), with the addition that the decision of the Duma group
is a decision of seven semi-Party people, and circulate it in the
districts. If even the base resolution of the 7Â Mensheviks for Jagiello
(and for the Bund) does not finally impel No.Â 6 to join us, the five must
speak out in W. and speak out very sharply.  

If the resolution about Jagiello was adopted under such circumstances
as Rusanovâs not yet having arrived or there

  Â  

being no certainty about his not being a Social-Democrat, then theÂ 7 simply
fooled theÂ 6, picked their pockets. In Rusanovâs place, on arriving later,
I would not have joined the Social-Democratic Duma group and would have
raised a terrific row.  

But if it was known that Rusanov was not a Social-Democrat, then it was
wrong to accept the base resolution without a protest.  

At any rate I would advise the Petersburg Committee to adopt a
resolution on approximately these lines (repeat the resolution which No.Â 3
has): 

The Petersburg Committee strongly condemns the resolution of the
7Â members of the Duma group who:
a) did not obtain exact information about the Social-Democratic workers in
Warsaw;
b) made no mention in the resolution of the protest of all the
Polish Social-Democrats against Jagiello;
c) made no mention of the two (out of three) electors from the Warsaw
workers;
d) represented the bourgeois vote for the P.P.S. as evidence of âthe
growth of political consciousness among the bourgeoisieâ, whereas it could
only be a matter of an honest man gaining by two thieves falling out;
e) deduced Jagielloâs Social-Democratism from his âstatementâ and from
the bloc of a section of the Social-Democrats with a non-Social-Democratic
party against the Polish Social-Democrats;
f) and what is most importantâdrew an incredible distinction
between âquestions of the internal life of Social-Democracyâ and
âquestions of political activity in the Duma, thereby encouraging
the separation of the latter from the formerâ.  

The Petersburg Committee condemns those who have taken such an
anti-Party step and thereby divorced them selves from the âinternal life
of Russian Social-Democracyâ.

17/XII 

Dear Friends, 

We are distressed not so much by the defeat over No.Â 16 as by the
inexcusable silence of friends (of the six or at least the five) on the
matter, and the light-hearted attitude to things. For this means killing
the cause, ruining everything. There is no declaration yet from the five or
the six, because they have not yet broken away from the grip of dishonest
people. (No.Â 3 says himself: it smacks of a criminal act!) Remember, for
heavenâs sake, that we shall all be responsible if this terrible assumption
proves correct. But the cheque must, at all costs, be made out in the name
of No.Â 3 or No.Â 5, the funds placed in charge of our own
 man[2]

at once, or No.Â 5 should take over
      control.[3]

A subscription campaign should be launched immediately everywhere and
letters from the co-operators printed every day about this.  

We still have no Duma materials, neither statistical reports
(1), nor
(2) the Duma bulletins, nor
(3) the Cadet interpellation,
(4) nor Kokovtsovâs memorandum,
(5) nor the Cadet or any other bills. Please exert every effort to obtain
this before the Duma adjourns and send it to us as soon as possible.  

Reply if only in a few words, but without delay.

19/XII.  

Dear Friends, 

The news of the inclusion by the liquidators of the point about
âcultural-national autonomyâ filled us with indignation! There are limits
to everything! The people who have broken up the Party now want completely
to destroy the Programme as well. Even where the arch-conciliator Plekhanov
draws the line, they do not. This is impossible. It cannot be tolerated,
       and....[1]

Resistance and protest must be organised at all costs. We must present an
ultimatum: let us speak up, [let] them read out this bilge, this
cultural-national autonomy, etc.! Exert every effort to do this, if only
through the five (better five with the Party policy than six wavering
between the Party and its liquidators).  

The base resolution about No.Â 16, the vile insertion of the
cultural-national autonomy point, and the pretensions to âpokeâ into the
newspaper question clearly show that there can be no illusions about
âpeaceâ with such
people.[2] They started the war by these moves. It is
necessary to give considered thought to this war and to wage it
energetically. For this, besides the above, two steps are essential:
(1) to submit written protests signed by the five threatening to appeal to
the Party organisationsâon all the above-mentioned and similar questions;
(2) arrange a meeting here of the five or the six (this is imperative!) and
finally decide on a line of action.  

Approximate text...: âWe, the undersigned, hereby declare that the
decision of the Duma group regarding Jagiello, the resolution about him,
the decision to insert the cultural-national [autonomyÂ ] point, run counter
to all the resolutions of Party congresses to such an extent that
we disclaim responsibility for these decisions, declare them

  Â  

to be anti-Party, reserve the right to appeal to the Party organisations,
and warn that by taking decisions such as these the Duma group is departing
completely from the Party road.â  

It is clear that the seven will pursue the liquidationist path
further.  

We must make haste with the organisation; write in detail about
Dyen. How are the finances? What about the editorial end? We wrote
specially asking No.Â 1 or No.Â 3 (Or both, which would be best) to bring us
the books listed.  

We earnestly beg you to do this. We shall cover the expensesÂ ... pass
on Falinskyâs book, and we are being scolded.  

2. Did No.Â 3 receive the money from Vienna? It is for Vetrov.  

3. Is it possible somehow to find out whether Vetrov received our
letters?  We have written him many times at the editorial office, but have
had no reply. Is it really impossible to obtain addresses for letters?



P.S. I am asked to add this: you have the right to take books from the
library.... For two weeks.

A reference to a declaration by the Social-Democratic group in the
Fourth Duma based on Leninâs theses âConcerning Certain Speeches by
Workersâ Deputiesâ (see present edition, Vol.Â 18, pp.Â 413â19).  

In accordance with Leninâs advice, the declaration included practically
all the main points of the minimum programme. However, the Mensheviks
succeeded in inserting the demand for cultural-national autonomy. On
DecemberÂ 7 (20), 1912, the declaration of the Social-Democratic group was
read out in the Duma.  

In December 1912 talks were conducted, on the insistence of the
liquidators in the Social-Democratic Duma group, on the merging of
Pravda and Luck into a ânon-factional workersâ
newspaperâ. As a result of the talks, the Bolshevik deputies of the Duma
A.Â Y. Badayev, G.Â I. Petrovsky, F.Â N. Samoilov and N.Â R. Shagov announced
in Luch No.Â 78 on DecemberÂ 18, 1912, that they were joining the
staff of Luck and the seven liquidator deputies declared they were
joining the Pravda staff. But on JanuaryÂ 30, 1913, the Bolshevik
deputies left Luck owing to disagreement with the liquidationist
line of the paper (see present edition, Vol.Â 35, p.Â 84, and NoteÂ 98).

For Vasilyev and No.Â 3. Dear friends, we received your news today that
the majority of the co-operative has again re stored the national-cultural
autonomy clause to please the Jewish nationalists and the rest of that
company. What is thisâa mockery of the six? Do these gentry not under
stand that by interpreting the Programme to please this company they are
thereby releasing the minority from

  Â  

submission? Why, it is a public disgrace that they should gain the upper
hand by making use of one chance vote of a muddled Menshevik, or perhaps
relying in this case on No.Â 16. We do not know what the six have done on
this question.  

But how can we silently submit, how can No.Â 3 agree to read such bilge
publicly (and thereby assume responsibility), how could the six (or at any
rate No.Â 3 alone) not come out at once with a statement in Dyen
that these gentry are making a mockery of the Programme and heading for a
splitâthis we cannot possibly understand. For if nothing is said, the
Jewish
       Marxists[1]

will walk all over us tomorrow. After all, there must be some limit. And if
these gentlemen think that the minority is obliged to submit even when the
Programme is obviously being torn to bits, they are badly mistaken.  

We sent in one general article on cultural-national autonomy before
your letter came (we quoted Plekhanov: the Caucasians and the Bund are
adapting socialism to nationalism). Today we are sending articles directly
against the co-operative. We would ask you to see that they are printed as
soon as possible, and we believe that if it is not too late you should take
resolute measures to prevent changes in the Programme. It is necessary to
fight, since the others are taking such steps. As regards the merging of
Vechernaya
     Pochta[2]

and Dyen you will all doubtless adopt the resolution, with the
exception of the pro-liquidators. This of course was trickery on their
part, and we shall not agree to join them in anything. Why are only four
coming? We earnestly beg you to get all six to come. This is extremely
important.

Cracow, DecemberÂ 22, 11912 

Dear Citizen, 

I could not understand your letter of
5.Â XII.Â 1912.[2] Either there is some misunderstanding or else there
exists a resolution of the Bureau unknown to me.  

LeÂ Peuple (Brussels) wrote: âAs regards representation of the
Russian socialist parties in the Bureau, the situation remains unchangedâ
(LeÂ Peuple, 30.Â XI.Â 1912). Is there another resolution of
the Bureau? If so, I trust you will be kind enough to inform me of it.


If not, the Central Committee of our Party has the right to appoint its
own representative.  

Why is this âonly temporaryâ? Of course a new decision of
the Bureau is always possible, but in this sense any
representation is âtemporaryâ.  

Is there a Bureau resolution to the effect that both Russian
Social-Democratic âfactionsâ (?) (the January and August conferences of
1912?) are requested to come to an agreement on the question of
representation in the Bureau?  

I shall be much obliged if you would inform me of that resolution and
the documents (if any) received from the âOrganising Committeeâ of the
liquidators.  

With fraternal greetings,


N.Â Lenin[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The original contains the following crossed-out text, written by Lenin
and addressed, evidently, to I.Â F. Popov: 

âReturn after reading (and give me your opinion; incidentally, the
Frenchman will perhaps correct the language) as soon as possible
and be sure to return Huysmansâs letter.  

âHÂ âs wants to arrange everything informally. We shall not
permit him to do it.ââEd.  
 



[2]
Camille Huysmans wrote Lenin on DecemberÂ 5 (N.Â S.), 1912, that he
considered the replacement of the representative of the R.S.D.L.P. in the
I.S.B. a temporary expedient, and that the final decision on representation
could be taken after agreement had been reached between Lenin âand the
other Social-Democratic factionâ (i.Â Â e., the liquidators).

Dear L.Â B., 

I received your letter and will try to fulfil your requests,
although I can promise no success as yet.  

The people are practically all
       here....[1]


The first impression (sous toutes rÃ¨serves) is most
favourable. No âmincingâ whatever. We are starting to confer today and
hope to make good progress. When we have finished I shall write to you
again.  

They have brought a letter from Alexinsky. I am enclosing it. When you
have read it (and made a copy for yourself) be sure to return it
without delay.  

Yesterday an extremely friendly letter arrived from Gorky, who appears
to be utterly âcharmedâ at the Vperyod people joining
Pravda.  

He writes that he and Tikhonov will take the literary section of
Pravda,Â ... and that âMachism, god-building and all that nonsense
have faded out for goodâ. Splendid!  

It was a mistake of yours to undertake to write a review on Steklov. It
wonât ring true....  

They promise to put out Prosveshcheniye in the middle of
January.  

Plekhanov wrote to Pravda (through Dnevnitsky), offering to
write an answer to Mayevsky, âprovided there is no double
censorshipâ. They replied consenting. They are awaiting

  Â  

the article. Buryanov has come to see Plekhanov. Plekhanov wrote him
opposing Jagielloâs admission.  

An invitation has been received from the Vorstand to a unity
conference: C.C.+O.C.+Plekhanov+Duma group+P.S.D. Weâll send them to the
devil. Entre nous!  

Iâm in a hurry. Must wind up. Everyone sends you best regards,
especially Malinovsky and Koba. We are terribly sorry you are not here. On
the whole things seem to be on the upgrade. Financially
Pravda is hard up, but we pin our hopes now on Gorky.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear L.Â B., 

I am taking advantage of a free minute to drop you a line in answer to
your letter. The meeting here is in full swingâ11 people are sitting
in.[2] Things are going better. If I can manage it, I shall enclose the
first resolution adopted today. Meanwhile, of course, show it to no
     one....[1]

Party workersÂ ... not bad: 3âSt.Â Petersburg, 2âMoscow, 2âthe South, a
number of prominent legal functionaries, and so on. It is working out
well. There have been conciliatory vacillations in the six, but so
far we are coming to terms better and better with the chief
conciliator among themâPetrovsky. The main issue will be that of
âunificationâ. We shall settle it probably this way: workers
from belowâwelcome; to the group of liquidators in Luchâwar.

  Â  

At least, as regards revolutionary strikes, such a re solution has
been adopted (unanimously).  

The German Vorstand has sent in a paper....  

The position is this: they make an experiment in the
legal field. Weâre glad. But we are extremely
cautious. No unification whatever with the group: enter
the organisations and we shall make an experiment. For Godâs sake,
keep the organisation abroad from taking any steps. Read the
letter (better relate this part of it) to 2â3 silent and
serious people: to Kamsky, Nik.Â Vas., but not to every body,
not widely. For God!s sake hurry with the C.O. and send at least the
proofs immediately!  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear L.Â B., 

I am writing at the meeting. Itâs going wonderfully. It will be no less
significant than the 1912 January Conference. There will be resolutions on
all important issues, unity included.  

We are all terribly sorry you are not here and have not been able to
come.  

I am sending the 1stÂ resolution. For the time being keep it a
secret; only get the
     backingÂ ...[1]

some of the Bolsheviks, who can hold their tongues.  

A happy New Year,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

All the resolutions are being adopted unanimously....


Gigantic success!  

We shall be through in 2â3 days.

Dear L.Â B., 

I am sending you the remaining resolutions....  

It has been strictly resolved that they be kept secret until
published in the
      press....[1]


Your letter has been handed to Malinovsky.  

The answer you sent to Huysmans is excellent.  

Our general impression of the meeting is an excellent one. I hope yours
will be the same. Let intimates into this, for the time being
confidentially (Kamsky, Albert...).  

Petrovsky is now ours completelyâso are the sixâa couple of good
non-legalists have returned to Russia. A single âcloudâ (a black
one)âthere is still no money. Complete bankruptcy.  

A thousand greetings,

 Yours,

 Lenin 


The telegram of the 30Â Bolsheviks has been received. A thousand greetings
and best wishes for the New Year!! From myself and from all our friends
here.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade Albert, 

I would like to have a talk with you about the resolution of the
meeting on the non-Russian
    organisations.[1]

You regard it as âdiplomacyââand that is a great mistake.  

In what do you see diplomacy?  

First of all in the fact that we raise a hue and cry against the
Executive of the P.S.D.ââand all information comes from the members of
the oppositionâ.  

This is glaringly incorrect!  

That Tyszka in the Executive evokes opposition and discontent
among the P.S.D. we have known for years. Everyone who
has worked with the Executive knows this.  

The development of this opposition since 1910 has been in plain sight.


In the spring of 1912 Tyszka and Co. dismiss the War saw Committee,
which they announce to be dependent on the secret political police, and set
up a committee of âtheir ownâ.  

In the autumn elections take place. And what happens? All the
worker-electors of Warsaw belonging to the Social-Democratic Party are
found to be on the side of the opposition!  

I checked this fact.  

The names of the electors are Zalewski and Bronowski. Malinovsky saw
them and verified the fact himself.  

Isnât this proof enough??  

On the side of the opposition we find also both the organisations
abroad and Lodz.  

Tyszkaâs policy of manoeuvring has long been heading for a fall. It is
inevitable. The 1912 January Conference (which did not touch at
all on the subject of Tyszkaâs (==the Executiveâs) split with the
opposition) had pointed

  Â  

to this course of events which it appraised in principle.  

The federation of the worst
type[3] is breaking up.  

A comeback (to 1907â11) is impossible.  

This has got to be understood.  

There was a similar period in Austria: a separate C.C. of the
nationals; no separate C.C. of the Germans.  

In Austria this did not last: from here the road leads either
to complete federation, or to complete unity.  

With us, too, semi-federation (1907â11) cannot last; no
effort must be spared to make the Party workers grasp this thoroughly.


We are out for complete unityâfrom belowâin the
national question as well.  

This is possible. We had and have it in the Caucasus (4 nations). We
had it in 1907 in Riga (the Letts, Lithuanians and Russians) and in Vilna
(Lithuanians, Letts, Poles,
     [RussiansÂ ],[2]

Jews)âin both these cities against the
separatism of the Bund.  

In Austria federation ended in separatism and break down of the united
party.[4] With us it would be criminal to countenance
separatism of the Bund and cover it up.  

You see âdiplomacyâ (20) in the fact that we
blame the Bund and âgrant almost an amnesty to the Lettish C.C., which is
following the Bundâ.  

No. You are mistaken. This is not diplomacy. The Lettish
Social-Democratic workers have always stood for unity from below,
have always been for territorial autonomy, i.e., have
taken an anti-separatist, anti-nationalist stand.  

This is a fact.  

You cannot deny it.  

The inevitable conclusion to be drawn from this is: the Lettish C.C. is
a deviation from the true path on the part of one of the
bodies of the revolutionary proletariat among the Lettish Social-Democrats.

 

In the Bund, on the other hand, there is no such true path, there is no
proletariat, no mass organisationsânothing but a circle of intellectuals
(Lieber+Movich+Vinitskyâout-and-out opportunists and
long-standing âbossesâ of the Bund) and circles of artisans.


It would be a glaring untruth to confuse the Bund with the Letts.  

The ânationalâ question in the R.S.D.L.P. has come up for
discussion. [This is inescapable.] The breakup of the non-Russian
organisations is no accident. And we should exert every
effort towards explaining the matter, towards renewing the struggle of the
old Iskra.  

We are against federation in principle. We are for utilising the
deplorable experience of semi-federation (1907â11).  We are in favour of a
campaign for unity from below.  

The comrades who used to work among the Jewish Social-Democratic
workers of Russia or who are generally familiar with the conditions, should
collect [information on] the harm of Bund separatism. The Bund
wrecked the Stockholm [resolutionÂ ]
(1906).[5] It united nowhere locally itself (the Letts never
did anything like it).  

Does anyone really believe that we shall forget this and allow
ourselves again to be fed with empty promises??  


Never! Unite in Warsaw, Lodz, Vilna, and so on, gentlemen âunitersâ of
the Bund!  

[I would be gladÂ ] if you would show this letter to the Bolsheviks
interested [in the national question and if] work could be started
everywhere on a serious study of the question and the collection of
material (Russiaâs experience) against the Bund âseparatistsâ.


Beste GrÃ¼&Bwhatthee,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Federation of the worst type is the way the decisions of the
1912 Prague Party Conference describe the relationships with the national
(non-Russian) Social Democratic organisations which existed within the
R.S.D.L.P. since the Fourth (Unity) Congress, when the ânon-Russiansâ
worked âin total isolation from Russian organisationsâ, which had an
extremely adverse effect upon the whole

 Â  

work of the R.S.D.L.P. (for further details see present edition, Vol.Â 17,
p.Â 464 and Vol.Â 18, pp.Â 411â12).





[4]
The Social-Democratic Party of Austria was dissolved as a united party
in 1897 at the Wiemberg (Vienna) Congress and a federative union of six
national âSocial-Democratic groupsâ: the German, Czech, Polish,
Ruthenian, Italian and Southern Slav, was established in its stead. All
these groups were linked merely by a common congress and a common Executive
Committee. At the BrÃ¼nn Congress in 1899 the partyâs Executive Committee,
was reorganised into a federative body consisting of executive committees
of the national Social-Democratic parties.

Lenin is referring to the âDraft Conditions of Amalgamation of the
Bund with the R.S.D.L.P.â adopted at the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. held in 1906, from AprilÂ 10 to 25 (AprilÂ 23 to MayÂ 8) (see
KPSS v rezolutsiyakh..., PartÂ I, 1954, pp.Â 134â35).

Dear Comrade, 

I would be much obliged if you could send me the two issues of
Bremer BÃ¼rger-Zeitung in which you published a review on Rosa
Luxemburgâs
book.[1]

I enclose a reply coupon for 20Â pfennigs.  

I am very pleased to see that on the main point you come to the same
conclusion as I did in the polemic with Tugan-Baranovsky and
VolkstÃ¼mler 14Â years ago, namely, that the realisation of
surplus-value is possible also in a âpurely capitalistâ
      society.[2]

I have not yet seen Rosa Luxemburgâs book, but theoretically you
are quite correct on this point. It seems to me, though, that you have
placed in sufficient emphasis on a very important passage in Marx
(Capital, Vol.Â II,
p.Â 442),[4] namely, where Marx says that in analysing annually produced
value, foreign trade should be entirely discarded (I am quoting
from the Russian translation). The âdialecticsâ of Luxemburg seem to me
(judging also from the article in Leipziger Volkszeitung) to be
eclecticism. Has any other organ of the press reviewed Rosa
Luxemburgâs book? Hamburger
Echo?[5] Bourgeois organs?  

One more question. Bremer BÃ¼rger-Zeitung (1912, No.Â 256)
incorrectly reported the meeting of the International Socialist Bureau in
October. Either the Luxemburg clique, or a liquidator, or a scoundrel
sympathising with the liquidators, misled the editors and attributed to
Haase the words: âLenin has simply misled the International.â  

The liquidators, naturally, repeated this lie in their newspaper
(Luch in St.Â Petersburg) and added a vicious comment. The Central
Committee of our Party (the Social-Democratic Labour Party of Russia) wrote
to Haase. Haase

  Â  

replied that his statement was misinterpreted. Haaseâs letter has now been
published in our newspaper (Pravda in
   St.Â Petersburg).[3]


At the moment I would like to know whether the editors of Bremer
BÃ¼rger-Zeitung intend to withdraw or rectify the erroneous statement
they have published. In this case I could send you a copy of
Haaseâs letter.  

With Party greetings,

 N.Â Lenin 

My address is: Wl.Â Ulijanow. 47. Lubomirskiego. Krakau.

Dear A.Â M., 

The comrade who will forward this letter on to you is Troyanovsky, who
now lives in Vienna. He and his wife have now energetically taken in hand
Prosveshcheniye. He has raised a little money, and we hope that
thanks to their energy and assistance we shall succeed in putting up a
small Marxist journal against the renegade liquidators. I think you, too,
will not refuse help for Prosveshcheniye.  

Yours,
 Lenin 


P.S. I hope you received my long letter concerning the Vperyod
       people.[1]

How on earth did you get yourself into

  Â  

Luck??? Not in the wake of the deputies, surely? But they simply
got caught in the trap and will probably soon leave it.

Dear Comrade, 

I shall try to fulfil your request and send you the Russian
sheets.[2] This is rather difficult now, though, and one cannot count
on too much: publishing in Russia is very poor and they are very
reluctant to send us publications from there, although we always ask
for them. There were 2â3 sheets in St.Â Petersburg before 9.Â I.Â 1913.  

As regards Polish literature, you are mistaken in thinking that I am
well placed. I have no means of approach to the P.P.S. Get them through the
O.C. and the liquidators. I have no contacts with the Social-Democratic
    âZarzadistsâ[1]

(Rosa and Tyszka) either.  

Please send me for a week or so Izvestia of the C.C.,
R.S.D.L.P., 1907, both numbersâI need them
badly.[3] I shall return them in due time.  

I enclose the letter to Comrade Kuznetsov which you asked
for.[4] 

With comradely greetings,

 N.Â Lenin

Leninâs letter is a reply to that of G.Â M. Vyazmensky, Manager of the
Archives of the Russian Social-Democrats in Berlin, who asked Lenin to send
Polish illegal literature and all illegal publications of the R.S.D.L.P. to
stock the archives; he offered to send Izvestia of the C.C.,
R.S.D.L.P. for 1907 which Lenin saw during his first visit to the archives
in the summer of 1912 and which he badly needed.





[3]
Izvestia of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P.âan illegal Bolshevik
newspaper, published in St.Â Petersburg from JulyÂ 16 (29) to OctoberÂ 11
(24), 1907. Three numbers were issued.





[4]
This was a letter of introduction by Lenin to N.Â V. Kuznetsov
(Sapozhkov), sent to Paris, in which Lenin apparently asked that illegal
Social-Democratic literature for the socialist archives in Berlin be handed
over to Vyazmensky. According to Vyazmenskyâs report, he visited Paris in
January-February 1913 and Kuznetsov handed over to him several valuable
numbers of illegal publications by the Bolshevik committees of the Urals.

We have received a stupid and insolent letter from the editors. We are
not replying. They should be kicked out.  

We have not received Luck No.Â 4. Will you please send
it!![2] 

The absence of news about the plan for reorganising the Editorial Board
is causing us great concern. What has been done for this
reorganisation?[3] Why donât Vera, Fram, Andrei or Alexei write a
single word? We earnestly ask them to write as quickly as
possible. Reorganisation, or better still the complete expulsion of all the
old ones, is absolutely essential. Absurdly conducted. They lavish praise
on the Bund and Zeit: itâs simply disgusting. They canât take the
right line against Luck. Disgraceful the way they handle
articles. Sheer stupidity about Rabochy
Golos.[4] Simply exasperating.... We are waiting impatiently for
news about all this....  

What has been done about the control of funds? Who has received the
subscription money? In whose hands is it? How much is it?  
 

Notes
 

[1]
This letter was added to that of G.Â Y. Zinoviev and was addressed to N.Â I. Podvoisky.âEd. 
 



[2]
What apparently interested Lenin in No.Â 4 of Luck for
JanuaryÂ 5, 1913, was a paragraph âRepresentation on the International
Bureauâ written in reply to a paragraph under the same heading in

 Â  

Pravda No.Â 201 for DecemberÂ 23, 1942. The liquidators declared in
Luch that they considered representation of the R.S.D.L.P. on the
I.S.B. (Lenin and Plekhanov) to be one-sided and raised the question of the
absence on the I.S.B. of a representative of the Menshevik Organising
Committee.





[3]
This refers to the reorganisation of the Editorial Board of
Pravda on the basis of the decisions of the Cracow meeting of the
C.C., R.S.D.L.P. with Party functionaries. The absence of news about the
beginning of this reorganisation caused Lenin grave concern, since in
January 1913 Pravda again made a number of mistakes in its
work. On JanuaryÂ 15 and 23 the newspaper published letters to the editor
from deputy Y.Â I. Jagiello, Polish Socialist Party member, in which he
advertised himself as a representative of the Polish working class; on
JanuaryÂ 17 and 24 Pravda published front-page advertisements
announcing the current issues of the liquidatorsâ newspaper Zeit,
the organ of the Bund; Pravda displayed indecision in the fight
against the liquidators; despite the recommendations of the Cracow meeting,
it did not publish certain articles forwarded to it by the C.C. Bureau
Abroad, etc.  

On JanuaryÂ 22 (O.S.) a joint meeting of members of the Bureau of the
C.C., R.S.D.L.P., in Russia with Pravda editorial staff was held,
attended by 12Â persons, among them C.C. members Y.Â M. Sverdlov,
G.Â I. Petrovsky, F.Â I. Goloshchokin, Secretary of the C.C. Bureau Vera
Lobova and others. A report was made at the meeting on the decisions of the
C.C. and the Cracow meeting concerning the reorganisation of the Editorial
Board; Y.Â M. Sverdlov was endorsed as editor of the newspaper with the
right of veto and censorship of all articles; a member of the
St.Â Petersburg Committee was elected to the Board for the purpose of closer
contact with the St.Â Petersburg Bolshevik organisation, and Konkordia
Samoilova was endorsed as secretary of the Editorial Board.  

As a result of these measures, the general level of the newspaper
rose. From FebruaryÂ 10 (0.Â S.) a Sunday supplement was issued in the form
of loose sheets. The paperâs circulation increased. In a number of
subsequent letters Lenin noted a considerable improvement in the work of
the Editorial Board.  

Zeitâa weekly, organ of the Bund, published in Yiddish in
St.Â Petersburg from DecemberÂ 20, 1912 (JanuaryÂ 2, 1913), to MayÂ 5 (18),
1914.





[4]
Lenin is referring apparently to the paragraph âA Quibbleâ published
in Pravda No.Â 6, JanuaryÂ 8, 1913, in which Pravda
denounced the improper conduct of the newspaper Luch, but made a
mistake in quarrelling with the editors of the journal Rabochy
Golos over minor questions not involving principles.  

The journal Rabochy Golos (Workerâs Voice), organ of the
Textile Workers Trade Union, was being prepared for the press, but did not
appear.

Dear L.Â B., 

I am returning the proofs. Further proofs, i.e., the resolutions, need
not be sent. Issue immediately in the cheapest possible form (no
money), i.e., in three columns, of a

  Â  

newspaper page size (1/2 or 3/4 of a page), printed on both sides,
without margins.  

Title: âMeeting of the C.C.
      [withÂ ]...[1]

Party
[Functionaries]â...[2]
to avoid a single dayâs detail.  

Print 3,000 copies. Ask Miron to see to it personally that the
proofs be corrected in actual practice (they usually donât do it,
and leave them uncorrected!) and generally see that it is put out quickly.


All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

I was very glad to get your letter of 21/I. These days there is no end
of disarray and organisational chaos. All the more pleasant is it to get in
touch with a comrade-in-idea. Please donât give up your intention of
sending in an article in February, and in general, be sure to write from
time to time. I hope you see from our newspapers and journals the general
line we now have to takeâagainst the enemy and (probably still more)
against those who are vacillating. Your contributions, seeing that we share
the same views, are doubly valuable in that you are close to the
capitals. Please try to obtain the local manuals of

  Â  

Zemstvo and factory statistics and similar publications. We are extremely
badly off for these.  

All the best....

Dear Friend, 

I was very glad to get your letter of FebruaryÂ 2 and exceedingly regret
that we have so far not been able to establish regular correspondence,
despite a number of at tempts on our part. The lack of such a
correspondence gives rise to misunderstandings. I welcome your criticism of
the withdrawal from Luch, as I welcome all criticism from Russia:
the absence of criticism makes a dead thing of it all. In this case,
however, your criticism is incorrect, and I simply donât know from what
side to start dealing with
it.[3] I shall wait until the next letter. As regards âreformsâ in a
certain newspaper, I must say that your absence is very
regrettable. Frankly, I consider the organisation of this business by you
to be a historic service, and your closing down of the âbig
       sisterâ[1]

and your âsemi-absenceâ in the summer to be a great
mistake.[4] But the past is gone and done with. We must make use of its
lessons for the future. The plan for a big newspaper is excellent. I am
convinced that two newspapers are neededâa big one for 5Â kopeks and a
small one for 1Â kopek, and the present paper should be worked into âa
small oneâ. Publication of pamphlets and books of 5â10 sheets is another
good idea. We are taking this up, too, energetically. We would be very,
very glad if you would take this in hand and we could succeed in
co-operating more systematically and effectively

  Â  

than in the spring and summer of 1912. An indispensable condition for this
is a personal meeting and regular correspondence. Gorky has now started
very energetically to assist Prosveshcheniye and turn it into a
big magazine. The publication of a big newspaper and books has every chance
of becoming a tremendous job of tremendous importance and usefulness. All
the more important is it to have proper organisation from the
outset. Experience has convinced us most fully that any attempt to reach an
agreement (as you suggest) with Plekhanov, Rozhkov, etc., is hopeless. We
are beginning at the other end. And we are getting better results. You
know, of course, that Alexinsky and Dnevnitsky came without any agreement
with us. Given correct and firm tactics, this will hold true still more in
the case of a big newspaper and the publication of books. We are fully
convinced of this. Firm tacticsâkeeping the leadership by the former
groupâenlistment not by contract, but as contributorsâall these
conditions are categorical for us. We shall find quite enough contributors,
I am sure, both for a big newspaper and for books and for a big
magazine. As for Bogdanov, for instance, even co-operation with him is
impossible: this is clear from his new
writings.[5] With Alexinsky and Dnevnitsky (Plekhanov) it is possible,
and remuneration will widen this circle of contributors fivefold. I await
an immediate reply:
1) whether you agree to the above or not;
2) if not, what your plan is;
3) how much money is needed;
4) how much you can raise;
5) how you define or plan your participation in the business as regards
sphere of competence, etc. Answer as precisely as possible. We must act
quickly. Time presses. The Moscow paper
       too....[2]

A good friend of mine will call on youâyou know him too. Talk things over
in a businesslike, precise manner.

[3]
This refers to N.Â G. Poletayevâs incorrect attitude to the withdrawal
of Bolshevik deputies of the Duma from the staff of the liquidationist
newspaper Luch. Poletayev considered that mutual collaboration of
Bolsheviks and liquidators in Pravda and Luch was
permissible. This point of view was denounced by Lenin.





[4]
After the appearance of the first number of Pravda, Poletayev
left St.Â Petersburg and withdrew from the newspaper. His absence led to the
closing down of Nevskaya Zvezda (âbig sisterâ). Lenin attached
great importance to Poletayevâs work in Pravda.

In 1913 A.Â Bogdanov began to publish his book The Universal
Organisational Science (Tectology), in which he elaborated
his empirio-monistic theories.

Dear L.Â B., 

Hanecki is with me just now. He is arranging for a general protest in
regard to the Basle
delegation.[1] 

Sign it (you and all the Basle delegates)

2) YuriâBekzadian. Bolleystr. 4. ZÃ¼rich 

3) the Troyanovskys, and have him sign all the papers and return them

This refers to the, protest of the R.S.D.L.P. delegation at the Basle
Congress against the improper action of the Secretariat of the
International Socialist Bureau, who had declared that the delegates of the

delegates at the Basle Congress and that the five delegates of the Polish
opposition sitting in would figure in the Congress report under an âXâ

Dear L.Â B., 

I am sending you the proofs. Question marks galore:

I have forgotten a great deal (not surprising in ten odd years). Take this
into consideration and write a very careful and very tactful
editorial note.  

You should not have asked Plekhanovâs and Martovâs consent for
disclosing the names of the anonymous writers. If they refuse to give it
(which they certainly will), you will be in a fix, yet we are
entitled and obliged to disclose the names of the
anonymous writers in the old Iskra; this should be done at all
costs. It should have been done without asking consent.  

Grigory and I agree to have the names disclosed in Proletary
and
Sotsial-Demokrat.[3] 
 

I am sending you a page of remarks.  

And so, we shall be seeing each other in the summer. Welcome. We have
rented a summer place at Zakopane (4â6 hours from Cracow, Poronin station)
from 1.Â V to 1.X; there is a room for you. The Zinovievs are near
neighbours.  

Bring as many books as you can, especially magazines, of which
we have none here. I am enclosing a list of what is needed. We
shall arrange by further letters for you to bring from Paris
whatever you can manage to lay hands on.  

Au revoir,

 Yours,

 L. 


P.S. ... Get together the whole polemic between Alexinsky and
   LunacharskyÂ ...[1]

and bring it with you. What do you think about the possibility of inviting
Alexinsky to the
     âschoolâ[2]

?

Gr. is for, I am against. Think it over. Could you arrange a
tactful tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte with Alexinsky for a general
talk, without mentioning the school for the time being? Let us
know what Lozovsky has hatched up about the strikes.

Dear L.Â B., 

I am sending you the set of Proletary (Nos.Â 1â20)
which you asked for.  

I have reread some of them. Do not forget to insert a whole chapter on
the Popular Socialist liquidators (from Two
Parties)[2] in your legal pamphlet. (Peshekhonov, Nos.Â 7
and 8 of Russkoye Bogatstvo, 1906âcf. Proletary No.Â 4,
âSocialist-Revolutionary
    Mensheviksâ.[1]

)



People now have forgotten everything. The novices know
nothing.  

Begin at the beginning and tell all about liquidationism (and
the âlegal partyâ) among the Popular Socialists.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear L.Â B., 

I am sending a cheque. Once itâs repayable, it canât be helped, no
matter how badly off we are. Arrange the lectures immediately, old
chap, on your way down here. I got back from Leipzig
today[2]: 64 marks is money, after all! Several cities will
make it much more.  

Today I shall send you the Duma materials. The deputies (6) have got to
be helped to write their speeches. Definitely. Sit down to it
yourself (the Duma is opening 24.IV, O.S., you must
hurry) and put Alexinsky on the job. A good excuse for
youâwrite him
pneu[1]

,

as to a Pravda
  Â  

contributor, and arrange to meet. It is desirable (but not
obligatory) that the speeches be sent via Cracow.

Dear Comrade, 

We shall be living at Poronin till OctoberÂ 1 (Galizien,
address: Herrn Ulianow), 4â6 hours from Cracow by the Zakopane line. Write
to the new address.  

Thanks for the leaflet of your C.C. which you sent
me.[1] Discuss as quickly as you can and when decided let me know
whether, for the purpose of general agitation before the congress,
you wish to issue a platform of the Lettish Bolsheviks (or
partyists, or anti-liquidators).  

I think it ought to be done. If you havenât the money, it could be
hectographed.  

I think that special emphasis in the platform should be made on three
points: 

(1) The liquidatorsâ renunciation of revolutionary
tactics. Their appraisal of the moment is a (veiled) liberal one. This
should be made clear.  

(2) About the liquidators; reprint (or quote in detail Luch
No.Â 101, editorial) and tell the Lettish workers the truth.  

(3) The national question. Separatism and federalism of the Bundists,
which have âwonâ the liquidators. The harm of cultural-national autonomy.

 

Would it not be better if your group moved resolutions on
these questions? Or would it be better to write a platform? What
would be more convenient for pre-congress agitation and for the election of
congress delegates?  

Write your opinion (and that of your friends). If a resolution or a
platform is needed we could help write it. What is the time limit? When is
the
congress?[2] 

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Exactly what leaflet of the C.C. of the Lettish Social-Democrats Lenin
is referring to has not been established. Probably it was a notice about
the convocation of the Fourth Congress of the Lettish Social-Democrats,
issued abroad shortly before, and published in the Central Organ
Zihna (Struggle) on MarchÂ 29, 1913.  

The leaders of the Lettish Bolsheviks reprinted this notice in their
organ Biletens (Bulletin) with critical comments concerning the
agenda of the congress drawn up by the liquidationist C.C., as it revealed
a tendency to evade key issues of principle. They criticised most sharply
the point of the C.C. decision which stated the latterâs intention of
making no preparations for the congress until 3,000 rubles had been paid in
to the C.C. account or t is purpose. The Lettish Bolsheviks regarded this
as a further attempt to put off the congress, the convocation of which was
insistently demanded by the bulk of the membership.





[2]
Following Leninâs advice the Lettish Bolsheviks came out at the Fourth
Congress of the Lettish Social-Democrats with their own platform and draft
resolutions. The draft platform for the congress was written by Lenin in
May 1913 and published in August 1913 in the newspaper Ci&nwhattheas
Biedrs No.Â 4 (see present edition, Vol.Â 19, pp.Â 110â18).

Dear Sh., 

Please note my change of address. We have come out here into the
country near Zakopane for a mountain air cure (we are at a height of about
700Â metres) for Nad.Â Konst.âs goitre. I had been warned: if you neglect it
it will be irreparable; take her at once to see Kocher in Berne,
heâs first-class, a celebrity.... On the one hand Kocherâs a
surgeon. Surgeons like to use the knife, and an operation here, I daresay,
is extremely dangerous and extremely doubtful.... On the other hand people
are treated with mountain air and rest. A ârestâ is hardly
practicable with us, owing to the nervous lives we lead. And this illness
is caused by nerves. We tried an electricity cure for
3Â weeks. Resultsânil. Nothing has changedâthe same bulging eyes, and
swollen neck, and palpitations of the heartâall the symptoms of goitre.


Could you make inquiries concerning Kocher? I donât know how
to go about it, and I want advice. Couldnât you go with somebody, a student
or a doctor, to consult Kocher? Or do you think he would not want to talk
without

  Â  

seeing the patient? Or could one have a talk with him on presentation of a
letter from the doctor in attendance here (that is, in Cracow)? If
inquiries of a serious nature can be made at all in Berne
concerning Kocher or with Kocher personally (the latter
would be best of all, of course) I would be much obliged to you. Should
inquiries point to the need of a journey to Berne, drop me a line
as to Kocherâs reception arrangements, when he goes away for the summer,
and how we are to fix up in Berne, in some hospital (is it very expensive?)
or otherwise.  

All the best, and thanking you in advance, for the trouble you are
taking.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin 

Absender: Wl.Â Ulianow. Poronin (Galizien).

Dear L.Â B., 

I am forwarding you Troyanovskyâs
letter.[2] 

In my opinion, that scoundrel Semkovsky (Grigory is sending you
Kampf) deserves an answer in a full voice only, not
like that given to Steklov in Neue Zeit.  

Write briefly but firmly and strongly about the traitors to both
socialism and democracy, about the blacklegging newspaper Luck,
about the bulk of the workers who are following the lead of
Pravda. If the opportunist Austrians refuse to print it, we shall
publish it in the report to the Vienna congress of
1914[3] I am strongly against any writing âkeyed to the meannessâ of
the opportunists of Neue Zeit or Kampf.  

What is your opinion?  

Yours,
 Lenin 
 

I am for writing to Kampf apart from Ryazanov. That
âhonest brokerâ will mess the thing up, complicate it by outward courtesy
and inward meanness. Better go direct and get a direct reply. If Ryazanov
wants to âhelpâ (hâm, hâm), let him do so on the
       side....[1]

(S.Â Y. Bronstein) âDie Wiederbelebung des russischen Proletariatsâ (The
Rebirth of the Russian Proletariat) published in the journal Der
Kampf No.Â 8, MayÂ 1, 1913. He promised the support of D.Â B. Ryazanov in
getting the article published in Der Kampf.

Dear Comrade Huysmans, 

For some time now Muranov has been treasurer of the Social-Democratic
group in the Fourth Duma. He publishes accounts of the moneys received by
the group in the Social-Democratic newspapers of St.Â Petersburg. According
to the newspapers the Russian workers, since the beginning of the general
strike in Belgium, have been making collections âfor the Belgian
workersâ.[3] For instance, Nos.Â 101, 102, 109 and 116 of
Pravda publish accounts over the signature of Muranov, who has
received about 500Â rubles for the Belgian workers collected among Russian
workers all over Russia. I have no doubt that the 800+700 francs received
by you were donated by the Russian workers for the Belgian workers. I shall
write to Muranov, and if these sums are of a different designation (which
is most unlikely) I shall let you know.  

[Variant of the
       letter[1]

Â ]



Most likely the 1,500 francs referred to were collected by the Russian
workers for the Belgian workers. Such collections have been made
since the beginning of the general strike in Belgium. The lists are
published in our Social-

  Â  

Democratic newspapers over the signature of Muranov, who is at
present treasurer of the Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma. I
shall write to Muranov and ask him to clear up this point.

Dear Comrade, 

I sent the draft platform to Herman in Berlin
     yesterday.[1]


The extract from Berzinâs
article,[2] which you have sent me, shows that he is a very stupid
conciliator. You must rally around you people who are steadfast and who

  Â  

understand whatâs what, but men like Berzin virtually help the
liquidators. They are servants of the liquidators.  

Send me a translation (into Russian or German, whichever you find
easiest) of Berzinâs whole article.  

Berzin should be given a detailed and sharp reply.


Regards!
 Yours,

 Lenin 


Having only a short excerpt from you, all I can say against Berzin for the
time being is this: 

Berzin tries to present the matter as if the âBolsheviksâ, or rather
the 1912 January Conference of the R.S.D.L.P., are effecting a split by
ignoring the Stockholm decision. Berzin shows by this that he is simply an
ignoramus. He does not know what the Stockholm decision
is about.  

The Stockholm Congress did not accept federation. It accepted
an agreement with the non-Russians (that is, the Poles, Letts and
the
Bund).[3] 

That agreement called for union of non-Russians locally. Why does
Berzin side-step this? Through ignorance or to cover up the liquidators?


Proofâthe decision of the Party at the 1908
December Conference (i.e., two and a half years after Stockholm).  

This decision reads (see p.Â 46 of the pamphlet All-Russia
Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. of December 1908): 

(Â§Â 1) âThe Conference directs the C.C. to take steps to wards
effecting union of the local organisationsÂ ... wherever this,
despite the decision of the Stockholm Congress, has not yet been
doneâ, 

(Â§Â 2) âamalgamation should be based on the principle of
unityâ. The Conference âstrongly declares
against amalgamation being based on the principle of
federalismâ.[4] 

And Berzin, after this, has the impudence to assure us that the
Stockholm Congress accepted federation!!  

Berzin is distorting the facts!  

It is the Bundists who did not carry out the decision of the
Congress and the Party, since they did not effect unity, but
effected federation against the decision of the Party.  

The January Conference condemns the Bundists and condemns

  Â  

federation.[5] If the Lettish C.C. did not attend the January
Conference (against the will of the Conference that
invited it) it is its own fault.  

Berzin defends liquidator splitters and Bundists, he defends
federation against the Party.

Social-Democrats of the Latvian Areaâ (present edition, Vol.Â 19,

[2]
This refers to the second article of Berzinâs series âNotes on
Tacticsâ, published in May 1913 in No.Â 2â3 of Biletens of the
Bureau of Lettish Social-Democrat Groups Abroad with the subheading
âPrinciples of Party Unityâ. In this article Berzin misinterpreted the
decision of the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. (1906) concerning
the conditions for amalgamation of the Lettish S.D.L.P. with the R.S.D.L.P.





[3]
This refers to the decisions of the Fourth (Unity) Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P., namely: =

2) âDraft conditions for amalgamation of the Lettish Social-Democratic

7/VI.Â 1913 

Dear Comrade, 

I have received and read the translation of Berzinâs whole
article.  

It is a good article. The only bad thing about it is that
passage that roused my ire. But I asked you right away to send me
the whole article, thus showing that I considered it necessary to
read it as a whole. While scolding Berzin for part of his article,
I asked you to send me the whole article. It follows from this
that you were rather hasty in forwarding to Berzin my angry
comment on this part of his article.  

Berzin has written me a letter in which he says that I was probably
ill-informed. (Naturally, one cannot be well informed of a
whole article from just one part of it!)  

Berzinâs whole article convinces me that he cannot be put
on a par with Braun. Berzinâs article, I repeat, is a
good article; it leads one to think that the difference of opinion
between us (concerning appraisal of the Stockholm decision, etc.) does not
involve any basic principles. It is hardly worth beginning an immediate
discussion of this difference in the press. It looks as if Berzin is coming
with us.  

If you have already sent a reply (for the press) to Berzin, I would
advise you to hold it up and send it to me: we shall talk it over.

 

Let me know as soon as you can what you have done with my draft of a
platform.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friends, 

We received both letters, thanks. We shall gladly give whatever help we
can. It is not worth writing special instructions. In a day or two we shall
publish a series of articles on this subject by Gr. Try and get it
reprinted in Metallist. We shall write for Metallist,
too, as and when

  Â  

we can: You must get them to pay authorâs feesâwe shall then widen the
circle of contributors at once. Apparently, in a day or two, there will be
another decisive meeting. We learn from letters from our people that the
liquidators are gathering all their forces to give decisive battle; our
people, of course, are not dawdling and are leaving nothing to chance. The
matter is extremely important and grave. You must fight hard to keep all
you have won. We are with you in this struggle heart and soul. Why did you
allow a liquidator to get in as
secretary?[1] And whatâs that affair about the insurance committee? We
await your letters. Let us know always what we have to write about
there. Keep us informed. We earnestly wish you success.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the re-election of the Executive of the St.Â Petersburg
Metalworkersâ Union. The meeting, held on AugustÂ 25 (SeptemberÂ 7),

 Â  

1913, was attended by about three thousand people. Despite the attempts of
the liquidators to set the meeting against the Bolshevik Executive, the
vast majority, amid applause, adopt ed a resolution expressing appreciation
of the Executiveâs activities. The liquidatorsâ list collected only some
150Â votes. The Bolshevik list, published beforehand in the newspaper
Severnaya Pravda, was adopted by an overwhelming majority.  

Secretary of the Executive of the St.Â Petersburg Metalworkersâ Union up
till AugustÂ 25 (SeptemberÂ 7), 1913, was the liquidator V.Â Abrosimov, who
was subsequently exposed as an agent provocateur.

Dear Colleagues, 

I received the issues of the enlarged Pravda only today,
16.VI.Â 1913, and hasten to congratulate the editorial staff and
contributors. I wish you every success. The important thing now, in my
opinion, is not to forget that we must fight to win 100,000
readers. For this we must (1) have a small, one-kopek, extremely popular
Sunday supplement. Write without fail, giving your opinion on this, and
also information on the estimates: i.e., how much extra money the
enlarged format has taken. And what the monthly expenses
now are, how much more than previously. The
great (and sole) danger for Pravda now is the loss of the
broad readership, loss of a position to fight for it.  

This is the first business point, and I would ask you earnestly to
acquaint the publisher with all the business points and kindly let
me have your answer.  

(2) On the question of the 7-hour day for postal employees, etc., the
editors have made an obvious mistake. We

  Â  

are all prone to make mistakes, and there is nothing particularly wrong in
that. But, in persisting in their mistake, the editors, for a
long time to come, if not for always, are âleaving a thornâ,
marring their reputation and position both in Russia and in Europe. I was
very pleased to see from the secretaryâs letter that not all the
members of the Editorial Board stood by the mistake. I earnestly advise you
to re-examine the question and take a different stand in print (by
publishing article by G.Â Z. unsigned, in the name of the
editors). Two lines would suffice: âHaving re examined the matter,
the editors have come to this conclusionââfollowed by G.Â Z.âs
article. Or: âHaving re examined the matter at a fuller meeting of the
Editorial Board and contributorsâ. This is worse than simply âhaving
re-examinedâ.[4] 

Let the liars from Luch dance a cancan for once over
this rectificationâonly false shame can prevent it being
made. It would be 1,000 times worse if Luch were forever
able to point to this error. An error rectified is an error no
more. Unrectified it becomes a festering sore. In such cases one must have
the courage to have it operated on at once. It wonât be very pleasant,
failing this, to have a number of Pravda friendsâboth individual
writers and organs of the pressâdissociating themselves from
Pravdaâs stand.  

Will you please discuss all this and drop me a line without delay.


(3) As regards Y.Â K. I have already written once. His article on
Alexeyenko is excellent. The author, of course, can give such articles
regularly. But you do not pay himâitâs a disgrace!! He writes me that he
is going to stop writing. You couldnât imagine, I trust, that the enlarged
format would involve extra expenses on paper and printing
alone. Naturally, you calculated on an unavoidable increase of
expenditure on the literary side too. Y.Â K. should top the
list. He has nothing else to live on now. We cannot afford to lose
such a contributor to both Pravda and Prosveshcheniye. I
therefore advise you most strongly to immediately adopt a decision to pay
Y.Â KâvÂ 75 (seventy-five) rubles a month. This is the minimum for a
regular contributor to both newspaper and journal; donât forget the
literary criticism section, too, which always

  Â  

leaves much to be desired and without which a âbigâ newspaper is
impossible.  

Will you please give me your reply on this immediately. I have a letter
from Y.Â K. in the tone of an ultimatum, and I consider it my duty to warn
the editors and publisher of Pravda that to run an enlarged paper
without the services of such a contributor is a thing I donât know who can
think of.  

(4) Vitimskyâs article in No.Â 123 is a very felicitous one in my
opinion. I congratulate the author. As for Stal, I think it ought
to be reprinted: itâs
good![5] 


[[

I am enclosing a reply to
      Vitimsky,[1]

which, I think, you ought to read (I am not sure whether Vitimskyâs letter
is a personal one; I donât think it is).

]]



(5) Alexinskyâs letter concerning âControversial
      Issuesâ[2]

has been lying in the editorial office for a month, we have been
told. I cannot understand this attitude!! The editors, apparently, do
not know the position, do not know the history of the
Vperyod group, and have fallen into an error with
Mr.Â Bogdanov (about this separately). Why could not Alexinskyâs
letter have been forwarded to us here?? This is necessary in order to
discuss the one and only Vperyodist who had the sense to revolt
against the vile empirio-monism and similar abominations which disgrace the
proletarian party. In publishing Bogdanovâs mendacious
letters,[6] the editors have made it difficult to arrange a
general discussion regarding Alexinsky: his letter, too, may be worthless,
but we have to talk it over. For that purpose we ask you to send
his letter on to us as quickly as possible, and generally send such things
to us.  

(6) In regard to the Bogdanov incident I am sending a separate letter
to the editors and publisher of
  Pravda.[3]

This question is extremely serious. I am loath to come out against the
editors of Pravda in printâwe have worked together too
longâbut for me to support otzovism is a sin aÂ 100 times worse
than supporting liquidationismânot

  Â  

only worse, but more dishonest. Frankly, I would be obliged to come out in
print too against such support, which has become clear through publication
of Mr.Â Bogdanovâs letter. If this is a slip, letâs rectify it. If it is
not, we shall fight.  

Send us Alexinskyâs letter. Very important. Alexinsky is
talking friendly, and youÂ ... respond with Bogdanov!!  

(7) I have received the money for April. That for May should
be sent. Please do not delay it. (I need money badly for my wifeâs
treatment, for an operation.)  

At your service,

 V.Â I. 

I am very much afraid that you may have alienated Plekhanov!! Potresov
lies and flings mud. To silence Plekhanov?? This would be an irretrievable
error.[7] 

Thanks very much for the promise to send the missing Nos. of
Pravda and Luch. Only you mistakenly mentioned once a
different number instead of No.Â 8 (number eight) for 1912
(nineteen twelve). Will you please send me this No.Â 8. It was
returned from under arrest to the editorial office in 180Â copies.

[4]
On the closing of the debate on the estimates of the post and telegraph
department in the Fourth Duma on MayÂ 22 (JuneÂ 4), 1913, voting was held on
the motion of the Duma Cadet group calling for a 7âhour day for post and
telegraph employees. The Duma Social-Democratic group, on the basis of
PointÂ 3Â (h) of the resolution on âThe Social-Democratic Group in the
Dumaâ adopted at the Fifth (All-Russia) Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. in
1908, abstained from voting. As a result the motion for a 7âhour day. for
post and telegraph employees was rejected. Polemising with Luch in
its articles âLiberal Failureâ (issue No.Â 117 for MayÂ 23) and
âLuch Against the S.Â D. Groupâ (issue No.Â 119 for MayÂ 25, 1913),
Pravda defended the wrong action of the S.Â D. group in the Duma.


After Leninâs remark, this error was rectified.  

In the resolution of the 1913 Poronin meeting of the C.C. with Party
officials on âSocial-Democratic Activities in the Dumaâ PointÂ 3Â (h) was
revised and endorsed in a new and improved wording.





[5]
The article by M.Â S. Olminsky (Vitimsky), âPravdaâ, devoted
to the appearance of the paper in enlarged format was published in No.Â 123
for MayÂ 30, 1913.  

In the same issue Pravda published the fragment of a poem by
the American poet, Horace Traubel, a former workman âCommon Men and
Womenâ translated by L.Â Stal.





[6]
Lenin is referring to A.Â Bogdanovâs letter-statement âA Factual
Explanationâ published in No.Â 120 of Pravda, MayÂ 26, 1913, in
which Bogdanov tried to refute the fact, pointed out by Lenin in his
article âControversial Issuesâ, that negation of Duma work and of the
employment of other legal possibilities derived from âVperyodismâ (see
present edition, Vol.Â 19, p.Â 154). Together with his letter âThe Question
of Mr.Â Bogdanov and the Vperyod Groupâ (ibid., pp.Â 173â74) Lenin
sent in to Pravda a paragraph directed against Bogdanovâs
distortion of the Partyâs history (this para graph was not published at the
time and has not yet been found). After the writing of his article
âIdeologyâ containing undisguised propaganda of Machist views Bogdanov
was struck off the list of Pravda contributors.





[7]
In AprilâJune 1913 Pravda carried articles by Plekhanov
âUnder a Hail of Bullets (Passing Notes)â. One of them was directed
against A.Â N. Potresov, âMr.Â Potresov in the Role of My Accuserâ
(Nos.Â 112 and 114 for MayÂ 17 and 19, 1913). Following this Pravda
published no more articles by Plekhanov up to JuneÂ 7, while Potresov, in
his feuilleton âIn the Grip of His Past (On Plekhanov)â published in
Luck Nos.Â 119, 121 and 122 for MayÂ 25, 28 and 29, 1913, continued
to âfling mudâ at Plekhanov. Criticism of Potresovâs attacks on Plekhanov
is given in Leninâs article âWorking-Class Party and Liberal Riders (On
Potresov)â (see Collected Works, Vol.Â 41, pp.Â 287â88).

Dear L.Â B., 

Before we quarrel (which I hope we shall not)âââI am
jokingâover âa special and unpleasantâ cause, let us chat about
something else.  

I am enclosing a letter from the I.S.B. Will the C.O.A. undertake it or
not? If they do, let them inform me in a formal way. If not,
return the letter.  
 

Tell the C.O.A.: a gendarmesâ report has been stolen (or otherwise
obtained), saying that a man named Polonsky, who left Russia
legally, is to be arrested on his return.  

If possible, let the C.O.A. notify everybody and try to find
Polonsky. I know nothing more.  

I wrote to Pravda about Alexinsky and asked them to send me
his
       letter.[1]

In regard to Bogdanovâs lie, I wrote a furious letter with an ultimatum
that it be published. We shall see. Otherwise I shall go to
Prosveshcheniye. ((I wrote to Prosveshcheniye about your
article too: I am wholly for itâre the
meeting of liberals and Pravda with Luch.))  

With regard to Alexinsky I advise putting the question
straightforwardly and honestly, in a comradely way. You are going to
consult against Lunacharsky? Bon! Mais alors de deux choses
 une[2]

:

either you revolt in print both against the
philosophical (câest dÃ©jÃ 
fait[3]

)

and the otzovist wing of Vperyod and you
declare that there were both a philosophically reactionary and a
politically anarchistic tendency in this group. I (Alexinsky) am
glad to be rid of both.  

In that case we can accept an honest bloc. With old squabbles
forgotten, we shall welcome a contributor (a 100Â times
less valuable than Plekhanov) to both Pravda and
Prosveshcheniye.  

Or you are shuffling? In that case go alone. You will be a
casual contributor, and we wash our hands.  

No diplomacy. Speak straight out. That is essential.  

Yours,
 Lenin 



P.Â S. Some time after the 20th I am going to Berne with N.Â K. I
shall be there on 27.VI. There will probably be an operation.  


P.S. Huysmans named the Polish delegates of the opposition without
mentioning that they were Poles!!! And

  Â  

he has listed you (+me+Plekhanov!!) as representatives on the I.S.B. (The
latest
Bulletin![5]) 


P.P.S. I had already written to Pravda about your
 fee.[4]

Today I am writing about the 75Â rubles, as per Grigoryâs letter.

Dear A.Â M., 

I wrote you from Cracow ever so long ago, but no reply.  

A letter has arrived today from Russia, from Odessa, saying that
Stark (?) (from Capri) is surprised I did not tell the man from
Odessa what I had learned from Stark and from you (!) about the
Odessa Bolshevik newspaper!!  

What is this misunderstanding, where does it come from?? I told the man
from Odessa that you had been writing me about a Bolshevik Odessa
paper of which I knew
  nothing.[1]

I still know nothing. The man from Odessa writes that âMalyantovich
juniorâ is a participant there. This is the first I hear of it. What
Malyantovich is that?
Nikitichâs?[2] (personally I donât know a single Malyantovich). The
lawyer in Moscow or somebody else?  

Write what you know about it. This misunderstanding has to be cleared
up.  

I have moved to Poronin (near Zakopane) for the sum mer for my
wifeâs health. I am going to Berne with her round about 27.VI.1913 for an
operation. My address is:
Poronin (Galizien). Austria.  

I shall be in Berne for 2â3 weeks. You can address your letters to me
there: Herrn Schklowsky. 9. Falkenweg. 9.  Bern (for Lenin).  
 

How are you getting on? Has your health improved since the spring? I
wish you with all my heart to get better and have a good rest.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Meaning someone connected with Nikitich (the revolutionary pseudonym of
L.Â B. Krasin). This might refer to the Social-Democrat V.Â N. Malyantovich,
who live in Odessa in 1901â07. He was the brother of the Moscow lawyer
P.Â N. Malyantovich.

Dear Colleagues, 

Will you please send me here, to Berne, my fee for May (also for June)
(100Â r.)  to the following address: 


Herrn Ulianow.  4.  Gesellschaftsstra&Bwhatthee.
4. Switzerland. Bern. Schweiz.  

I shall have to stay here for about a month, as my wife is going to
have an operation. I need the money badly.  

I hope in a few days to arrange contributions to Pravda from
here too.  

As regards my article against Bogdanov, I am very much surprised that
the editors evade the real issue: Bogdanov has misled
them, and through them, 40,000 readers! How can one put up with
this?? I agree to throw out the word âmisterâ, and leave simply
    âBogdanovâ.[1]

This ought to satisfy you.  

Regards,
 V.Â Ilyin

29/VI.Â 1913 

Dear L.Â B., 

I received the C.O. and letter. Thanks very much.  

Kocher is a great botherâcapricious. He still hasnât received us. We
shall have to wait.  

Redouble your efforts in regard to Pravda if
possible. Miron has been taken. Weâre short-handed. I
cannot write now.  

Good news from St.Â Petersburg about the P.C. and the Metalworkersâ
Union, also about prospects for the school:
promised by the six. Samoilov is due in Zakopane in 10
days. Plekhanov is in Paris, they say. See him if you can, itâs extremely
important. I wrote to him (in strictest secrecyâonly to him personally)
about the school and invited him to
come.[1]

He keeps silent, the slyboots, Ignatius Loyola, the master shuffler. All
the worse for him. We shall have a school. Gorky has as good as consented.


Au revoir!

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. Best regards to all our Paris friends.  


P.S. We pin great hopes on Tulyakov. Less on the others (of his
group). They thirst for âlearningâ and demand Plekhanov. Heâd be a fool
not to go.  

There are rumours here that Plekhanov is going to Beatenberg round
about the 10th of July. Have you heard any thing about this in Paris?  

Thereâs no need to tell Alexinsky about the school for the
time being. We still have time to do that if need be. It will not
be until August.

Dear Lydia Mikhailovna, 

I am sending you a postcard I have bought for you with a plan of Berne
and a note of the necessary addresses.  

I strongly advise you to go to Berne: you must receive treatment, and
Kocher is the only one who can cure you. I have made inquiries of
every kind, looked up medical literature (a big book by the son, Albert
Kocher, on goitre), consulted physicians in Berne, and I speak from
experience.  

Write to Professor Kocher in September asking him to make a definite
appointment (and mentioning that you dispose only of such-and-such
a sum, otherwise youâll have to face the unpleasant prospect of haggling
with the tight fisted Frau Professor). He will answer, fixing a
date when he can receive you. Then you can start out. Life in
Berne is cheap. Weâll give you introductions to Shklovsky and
Shenderovichâthey will help you. In a few months you will forget that you
were an invalid.  

All the best. We shall be seeing you soon.  

Yours,
 V.I.

Dear Comrade, 

You have written the wrong thing to Shklovsky. What was needed was how to find the person, and not a biography. And you did
not give Shklovsky your address. In executing an important assignment you
should be more careful,

  Â  

otherwise you will be a 100Â times to blame for failure to find an important
person to assist the cause.  

Please rectify the mistake at
once.[1] 

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Colleagues, 

Yesterday I sent to Prosveshcheniye a long article âHow Vera
Zasulich Demolishes
  Liquidationismâ.[1]

If Severnaya Pravda is still coming out I suggest publishing this
article in six feuilletons, one section per feuilleton, the manuscript,
however, to be preserved and returned immediately to
Prosveshcheniye.  

I repeat, I cannot work without seeing the newspapers. A thousand
requestsâand still you do not send either Rabochaya
Pravda[3] and Zhivaya
Zhizn[4] (sets), or Severnaya Pravda and Novaya
Rabochaya
Gazeta.[5] This used to be done before.  

Why publish daily, I donât understand. I advise changing over to a
weekly issue. What is the daily loss? What is the circulation?  

Greetings and best wishes!

 Yours,

 Lenin 

The promised and long-earned fee from Pravda has
not been received! This is becoming insulting!!

I have not seen anything!!!  

Ask Avel to send them to me daily by book-post from St.Â Petersburg,
wrapped up in a couple of bourgeois news papers of a discreetly moderate
and exceedingly quiet trend. Pending a reply from Avel, send me,
please (when done with), Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta and
Severnaya Pravda, and Nash Put, Moscow

Dear Comrade, 

As a member of the Editorial Board of Iskra and
Zarya, which, ten years ago, you rendered such valuable service,
and as a representative of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party,
which will never forget the fraternal assistance you gave it during this
vital period of its upbuilding, I hasten to congratulate you most heartily
on my own behalf and on behalf of the Central Committee of the

  Â  

Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, on the occasion of your seventieth
birthday.  

I wish you long years of work for the benefit of inter national
Marxism.  

With Party greetings,

Dear Colleagues, 

I have just read No.Â 8 and cannot help expressing my surprise at your
publishing such an article as âA Meeting of
Marxistsâ,[2] etc.!! To my mind this was extremely unwise, and if the
author, for obvious reasons, was âcarried awayâ, you, on the spot, should
have realised the impossibility of printing this article. For Godâs sake
avoid such carelessness: in this way you are giving the very devil
of assistance to all our enemies.  

It is necessary to reprint (gradually) from No.Â 8 the articles
of Petrovsky and of the former
conciliator.[3] 

Best regards,

 V.I. 

I earnestly request you to change my address: I have written and asked,
but it doesnât help!!  

Ulianow. 51. Ulica Lubomirskiego. KrakÃ³w.

Dear Comrade Editors, 

Allow me, in the columns of your newspaper, to announce our reply to
the many people from the Far North, the West, East and other places, who
have written to us for information about the liquidatorsâ âcampaignâ
against the âinsuranceâ expert, Comrade X.  

The liquidators accused him of duplicity, of serving both the employers
and the
workers.[5] 

What does the organisation do in the case of such accusations?


It calls together representatives of different bodies serving the
labour movement and authorises them to investigate the matter. That is what
it did. The findings of the committee of representatives from
five bodies
(1. the Editorial Board of Pravda;
2. the Editorial Board of Prosveshcheniye;
3. the Editorial Board of the Polish Marxist organ;
4. the six Social-Democratic deputies in the Duma;
5. the Chair man of the Metalworkersâ Union) were published in No.Â 12 of
ZaÂ Pravdu for
     OctoberÂ 17.[1]


The committee found, 

ââthat the allegation of the liquidators âis
untrueâ; 

ââ-that X., having given up working for the
employers, thereby fulfilled his duty.  

In the previous issue (No.Â 11 of ZaÂ Pravdu for OctoberÂ 16)
A.Â Vitimsky made it amply clear that X. was âguiltyâ only of leaving the
employers to serve the labour movement. Vitimsky added that he had
communicated to the secretary of ZaÂ Pravdu the names of the
liquidators working as secretaries of employersâ
    bodies.[2]


And what did the liquidators reply? They made no at tempt to deny
either Vitimskyâs statement or the fact that X. had given up working for
the employers.  

Nor did they attempt to form any kind of committee

  Â  

from among âtheir ownâ seven deputies, or from any trade union,
or from any âleading bodyâ of Letts, Jews or Caucasians.  

They did nothing of the kind!  

People devoted to the organisation set up a committee, investigate the
matter and adopt a decision.  

The liberal hacks of Novaya Rabochaya(??) Gazeta, who
are independent of the workersâ organisations, are continuing their
campaign of vicious lies and slander!! They are trying to fool simpletons
and ignoramuses by accusing X. of âduplicityâ on the grounds that he
secretly began, under a pseudonym, to help the workers, though he
had not yet given up his job for the
     employers!![3]


Clearly, the workers are turning away with disgust from these
contemptible anonymous slanderers from the liquidatorsâ rag of a
newspaper, which is supported by the bourgeoisie.  

But that is not enough. Turning away is not enough. A shameless smear
campaign against a person is an old device of the liquidators, who
are out to destroy the organisations of the workers.  

No organisation is possible without an
organisational rebuff to such a method of political
âstruggleâ. What should such an organisational rebuff consist in?  

Every worker must demand that the liquidators, from whom Marxists have
turned away with contempt, should set up a committee of âtheir ownâ from
âtheirâ seven members, their âownâ âleading bodyâ of Jews, Letts,
Caucasians, etc. Let them try to arrive at âtheir ownâ decision
and communicate it to the International. Then we shall brand these
slanderous rascals before the whole world.  

While these scoundrels, these dirty characters, are hiding behind
anonymous articles in the liquidatorsâ newspaper, let every
union of workers charge its executive with the investigation of this
matter, by collecting all documents and information from everywhere, by
checking the decision of the Marxist committee of
five bodies and adopting a decision of their own.  

Universal condemnation of the slanderers, a universal

  Â  

demand: âRetract your base slander, or we shall not let you enter a single
organisationââthat should be the reply of the working class, the
organisational reply to the wreckers of the organisation.  

V.Â Ilyin[4]


This question of principle should be raised in the Duma.  


P.S. If ZaÂ Pravda is closed down, you must tone down
fivefold, become more legal and tamer. This can and
should be done. Write the way they do in Voprosy
Strakhovaniya[6] and establish your own censorship. For
Godâs sake, do this, otherwise you will just ruin the business.

XâK.Â A. Komarovsky (B.Â G. Dansky). He joined the
R.S.D.L.P. in 1911, wrote for Zvezda and Pravda and took
part in the insurance movement; in 1913â14 ho was a member of the
Editorial Board of the Bolshevik journal Voprosy Strakhovaniya. In
order to discredit the Bolsheviks the liquidators accused Dansky of working
in the bourgeois press. The Party committee investigating this accusation
found that Dansky, since joining the ranks of the Bolshevik Party, had
ceased working in the bourgeois press, and therefore recognised him as an
honest member of the Party and qualified the accusation levelled against
him by the liquidators as slander.  

The question of Komarovsky was dealt with a second time by a committee
consisting of representatives of the newspaper Za Pravdu and the
journals Prosveshcheniye and Voprosy Strakhovaniya,
6Â worker deputies, in the Duma, members of the staff of the Priboi
Publishers and a representative of the âorganised Marxist workersâ. The
committeeâs findings, published in No.Â 32 of the newspaper Za
Pravdu for NovemberÂ 10, 1913, under the heading âAn End to Slanderâ,
stated that âthe committee sees no obstacles whatever to Xâs continued
contributions to Marxist publications and to his presence in comradesâ
midstâ.  

The liquidatorsâ smear campaign against Komarovsky was mentioned by
Lenin in the Report of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. to the Brussels Conference (see
present edition, Vol.Â 20, p.Â 524).

Dear Citizen Huysmans, 

You remember, of course, that the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P., after the
conference of the R.S.D.L.P. in January 1912, which restored our Party,
appointed me the Partyâs representative on the I.S.B.  

Owing to my departure from Paris, I was obliged to ask Comrade Kamenev,
who lives in Paris, to take my place. Cracow is too far away from Brussels,
and I would ask you to enter Kamenevâs name and the official address of our
Bureau in Paris in the Bulletin. Mr.Â Kouznetzoff (pour
Kameneff). 102. Rue Bobillot. 102. Paris. XIII. Kamenev will spend some
time here, but I would ask you not to indicate his address in Cracow. It
would be imprudent for secrecy reasons.  

In urgent cases I would ask you to write to my present address.  
 

It being All Saintsâ Day, your letter was delivered a little late.

What should have been written is: âMr.Â Koltsov, you are a blackmailer,
like Gamma is. I am not answering you.â I am angry, almost furious at the
âconversationâ with Koltsov!! Fancy calling such a scoundrel âdear
comradeâ. What is this? What do you call
it??[1] 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The reference is to the article by M.Â Chernomazov (Firm), âAn Answer
to D.Â Koltsovâ, published in ZaÂ Pravdu No.Â 42, NovemberÂ 23,
1913. The article was in response to âAn Open Letter to M.Â Finnâ by the
Menshevik Koltsov (B.Â Ginsburg) published in Novaya Rabochaya
Gazeta No.Â 87, NovemberÂ 20, 1913. Koltsov, who took part in the smear
campaign against the Bolsheviks in connection with the Dansky affair (see
Note 298), accused Chernomazov of lying and slander because the latter
declared that Koltsov him self, while serving in the Council of the Oil
Industrialistsâ Congress in Baku, had acted in a similar role as Dansky,
who was accused of political double-dealing by Novaya Rabochaya
Gazeta. In his âAn Answer to D.Â Koltsovâ, beginning with the address
âDear Comradeâ, Chernomazov stated that he had read âAn Open Letter to
M.Â Firinâ with âa feeling of deep painâ and upheld his position in a
polemic with Koltsov.  

This document is a postscript to L.Â B. Kamenevâs letter addressed to
the editors of ZaÂ Pravdu.

Our representativeâs telegram, which I received yesterday, says on this
question only: âunification entrust ed to executive.â  

And so the question is not
clear.[3] 

Just in case, and subject to the extremely important reservation that
there should be no haste in publishing it, I suggest the following text of
an editorial statement (seeing that the âstormâ has already been raised
in the dirty tea-cup of the Burenin-Gamma newspaper).  


The decision of the International Socialist Bureau to call a conference
of Russiaâs Social-Democratsâthose working in Russia, of course, and not
the shadows of them abroadâfully meets with our approval. Such a
conference will help most clearly to expose the treachery to the Party on
the part of the liquidator gentry and the Burenin methods of fellows like
Gamma, of whom it is high time that Social-Democracy rid itself.  


Tomorrow (or the day after, at the latest) I shall probably receive a
detailed report from London. I shall then write to you immediately again,
and if it is necessary not to publish the statement I am sending
you (i.e., the one on the preceding
       pageÂ 3[2]

)

I shall wire: hold it up. This will mean, consequently, that
pageÂ 3 is not to he published.

This letter to the editors of ZaÂ Pravdu was the second letter
written by Lenin on receipt of the first reports concerning the decisions
of the December meeting of the International Socialist Bureau of the Second
International on the question of unity within the R.S.D.L.P. (see present
edition, Vol.Â 19, pp. 516â18).  

The December meeting of the I.S.B., held in London on DecemberÂ 13 and
14 (N.S.), 1918, adopted a resolution on this point moved by Kautsky on
behalf of the German delegation. In a speech on DecemberÂ 14 introducing his
resolution Kautsky declared that âthe old Social-Democratic party in
Russia has disappearedâ. It was to be restored on the basis of the Russian
workersâ urge for unity. In his articles âA Good Resolution and a Bad
Speechâ and âKautskyâs Unpardonable Errorâ Lenin examined the resolution
and qualified Kautskyâs speech as monstrous (see present edition, Vol.Â 19,
pp.Â 528â30 and 546â47).  

At a conference held in July 1914 in Brussels in accordance with a
decision of the I.S.B., the leaders of the Second International, under the
guise of âreconcilingâ the Bolsheviks with the liquidators, demanded of
the Bolsheviks that they cease their criticism of the liquidators. The
Bolsheviks refused to bow to this demand and continued their irreconcilable
struggle against the liquidators, the enemies of the labour movement.

Six presented no demand whatever owing to rules. Bureau voted no
condemnation whatever. Repudiate bare faced lie of
liquidators.[1] 

Ilyin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In connection with the December meeting of the I.S.B. the
liquidationist Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta (No.Â 97 for DecemberÂ 3,
1913) published a telegram from London reporting that the Bolsheviksâ
demand that the Social-Democratic Labour group in the Duma (the Six) should
be represented by one of its members in the Inter parliamentary Section of
the Second International was rejected by the I.S.B. As a matter of fact
this question was not discussed by

 Â  

the I.S.B. and the Bolsheviks presented no such demand, since according to
the Rules of the Inter-parliamentary Section only one socialist group from
each parliament, the one that had most deputies, was to be represented on
it. In the case of the Russian Duma this representative was one of the
liquidationist âSevenâ, who had a nominal majority of one. This question
was dealt with by Lenin in his article âHow the Liquidators Are Deceiving
the Workersâ (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Ed., Vol.Â 24,
pp. 205â07).

20/XII.Â 1913 

Re the article you recommended for

 publication.  

Dear Colleague, 

I received the article âFor a Common
       Bannerâ[1]

and in all honesty I must say that it is no good at all. Frankness and
candour above allâdonât you agree?  

The author has absolutely failed to understand the state of affairs in
Russia and has let himself be carried awayâto put it more mildlyâby a
spirit of, let us say, excessive amicability towards the Gothamite
Mensheviks.  

Russia is going through a process of restoration and consolidation of
the Marxist workersâ party. The discussions and resolutions, which raise
in the author such a short sighted sneer, are of tremendous educative and
organisational significance. The authorâs ironical reference to the
âHurray shoutingâ is sheer liberal irony, the irony of an
intellectual who is completely out of touch with the working-class
movement. How is it that in no other opposition

  Â  

party in Russia do the local groups of party members openly discuss the
partyâs internal differences?? Eh??  

The author adheres to a sort of sentimentally hysterical point of
view. The resolutions represent an all-important process of consolidation
of the workersâ party, for no one in the world can make
the workers choose between two hurrahs (that of the partyists and
that of the liquidators) other than conscious sympathy and a
sorting out of trends. To allow the somewhat rude form of proletarian
âbrawlâ to screen the tremendous ideological and organisational
significance of the working classâs struggle over two trends, is phenomenal
blindness. I can think of no better explanation of this blindness than the
fact that the author is completely out of touch and has âfallen under the
spellâ of the vile Menshevik gang.  

The author has absolutely failed to understand the reference to the
worker curia. 47%â50%â67 % in the 2nd, 3rd and
      4thÂ Dumas.[2]

Is that a fact or not?? What has the âreactionary nature of the
curiasâ (about which the crooks and the Burenins shout from the columns of
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta, drawing a red herring across the path)
got to do with it?? Did not the same reactionary law, meaning the same
curia law, apply in all three cases? Even an infant would understand that
the reactionary nature of the curias has nothing to do with it. The fact
remains that the intelligentsia have cleared off (and good riddance to the
whores) and the workers have found their own feet against the
liquidators. A new historical period. A new epoch. Yet the author invents a
âmiddle lineââit would be funny were it not so sad. The author has not
understood one-hundredth of the depth of the struggle against the
liquidators. The Party cannot be restored unless it is restored
against the liquidators. The workers have grasped this now
themselves.  

For a month, from 20.X to 2.XIâ4,800 signatures (N.B.) for
the six and 2,500 for the seven (including 1,000 Bundist
signatures. N.B.!  N.B.!). Is that a fact or not?? This is a fact, sir, and
not intellectualist whining! It is not a party, if you please, since they
have no âcommonâ organisation,

  Â  

no âcongressâ!!! Ha-ha!! Nor will there be anything in common
with the liquidators and Bundistsâit is time to understand this instead
of contemplating the old that is gone and done with. A congress is
extremely difficult to call (hence the wreckers of the Party refer
things âto a congressâ, sort of ad kalendas graecas!). These
signatures, as it happens, represent the new form of the
old party. Fancy not being able to understand this!  

The old national âfederation of the worst typeâ has gone for
good. This is another thing the author does not understand.  

The author has a wrong idea of equality between theÂ 6 and 7 (he is
wrong to talk about theÂ 8, since the Party does not recognise the
eighth as a
   Social-Democrat[3]

).

Why shouldnât the Party grant equality to the near-Party group in the
     Duma??[4]

The author has not understood the serious significance of the conception
ânear-Party peopleâ.  

Our journal is not a literary miscellany, but a militant organ. There
can be no question, therefore, of publishing the article. I would be very
glad, however, to see the authorâs retort to my criticism, as I would
generally welcome any exchange of opinions with old friends. If I have come
it too strong with this criticism and expressed myself sometimes none too
politely, I beg his pardon. I can assure him I had no intention of being
offensive, but simply, for old friendshipâs sake, unburdened myself and
said what I thought with open-hearted candour.  

How splendidly the campaign for the six against the seven is going!
What a wonderful rallying and education of the workers against the liberal
labour politicians! What an excellent example, the first in Russia, of the
workersâ party actually deciding the fate of its own
representation in the Duma! This is no longer a crowd âwho have done a
little readingâ, but an organised force. The conference decidedâthe six
actedâthe organised thousands approved by discussing and signingâthat
is called a party against that rag of a paper, the new edition of
the old Tovarishch,

  Â  

Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta, which is fouling and poisoning the
working-class movement with its intellectualist muck. And how splendidly
the workersâ Duma group has developed its activities! Right away a step
forward not only in name, but in all its work! What an excellent speech,
that of Badayevâs, on the freedom of coalition, compared with the iteration
of shoddy liberal ideas by Tulyakov!  

Au revoir, dear comrade. Spit on the Mensheviks more often, study the
facts of the present-day labour movement, weigh their
significance, and yourâbegging your pardonâmoping mood will pass;
instead of searching for a âmiddle lineâ, you will help to rally the
workers against the gang of traitors.  

Yours,
 V.I.

This article is marked with threeÂ Ks
(KKK).[2] The boycott slogan should be given everywhere, but precisely
in such a form, and only in such a form, without using the word boycott.


For the sake of all the gods that be, donât be drawn into giving
âscathingâ answers to such gentlemen!

Apparently this refers to an article by Lenin in connection with the
decision of the December meeting of the I.S.B. and the slanderous campaign
which the liquidationist newspapers raised around the resolution of the
meeting calling for a âunityâ conference of the R.S.D.L.P.  

The decision of the Cracow meeting of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. with Party
functionaries âOn the Reorganisation and the Work of the Editorial Board
of the Newspaper Pravdaâ stated that all âarticles, which the
C.C. considers obligatory for publication, should be published immediately
(over an agreed signature)â (Lenin, Collected Works, Fifth
[Russian] Ed., Vol.Â 22, p.Â 270). This agreed signature were the letters
âKKKâ. The C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. reaffirmed this decision at its meeting
in December 1913: âThe for mer ruling to the effect that articles sent in
over the prearranged letters are to be published immediately and without
modification remains in forceâ (Istorichesky Arkhiv No.Â 4, 1959,
p.Â 42).

2/I.Â 1914 

Dear Comrade, 

The brevity of your letter surprises us greatly.  

Where (âfartherâ?) did the delegate
go?[1] 

To Hamburg? To Brussels? To Copenhagen?  

Who is this delegate? A true Bolshevik? Or a liquidator? Or a
vacillator?  What did he tell? How many delegates are there
altogether? How many delegates from Riga? From the villages? From
Libau? From other towns?  

Did you arrange to correspond with this delegate? This is the most
important thing of all: he must write to you every
day in the most precise and detailed manner. Did he give you any
address?  

Wire to us immediately you learn anything:
addressâUljanow. 51. Lubomirskiego. Krakau.  

Code words:

 FirstâBrussels

 SecondâHamburg

 ThirdâCopenhagen

 opening date of congress:

day (month of January)+10 (i.e., if 11.Iâthen 21)

 and so on.

 or: âindefiniteâ

 or: âpostponedâ

 plus=Bolsheviks certainly preponderate

 minus=liquidators â â

 X =unknown.

 

Write after each meeting with delegates or after each letter. (Are most
of the delegates travelling by sea?)  

Today we received a letter from Brussels (dated 29/XII) saying that we
are invited to the congress due to be held in 10â12 days; place and time,
it said, will be communicated later.  

And that is all!! Very little!  

So write and wire!  

Yours,
 V.U. 


If the delegate is in Brussels and if you can write to him absolutely
confidentially, give him the address: Jean Popoff. Rue du
Beffroi. 2. A. Bruxelles.  

This is our representative, through whom you can find out everything
and with whom you can talk. Absolutely trustworthy.  

If Tyszka (âExecutiveâ of the Polish S.Â D.) is invited, then the
âoppositionâ=Warsaw and Lodz committees should be invited too. Write to
Karlson about this.  

Write to Karlson in Brussels (if he is our man) that he should notify
both Popov and us by both telegram and letter.  
 

Notes

This refers to the journey of a delegate to the Fourth Congress of the
Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region which was held in Brussels from
JanuaryÂ 13 to 26 (JanuaryÂ 26 to FebruaryÂ 8), 1914. The name of the delegate
has not been established.

7/I.Â 1914 

Dear Comrades, 

I have just received information from our representative in Brussels,
Popov (Jean Popoff, rue du Beffroi. 2. A. Bruxelles),
that the congress will be held there (or near there) ânot later
than within a weekâ (written 4 or 5.I).  

The task now is to try and rally the Bolsheviks. You have committed a
gigantic mistake in not making arrangements

  Â  

for correspondence (this can be safely done abroad) with your travelling
Bolshevik. Try immediately to rectify this mistake by sending a
letter at once to this Bolshevikâin two envelopes, addressed to
Popov, with the inner envelope inscribed in Lettish: personal,
for so-and-so.  

Popov will find him and hand over the letter personally. In this letter
you should
(1) fully recommend Popov (I vouch for him) (and give (N.B.)
Popovâs Brussels (N.B.) address) and
(2) ask that the Lettish Bolshevik should immediately
give you a detailed account of everything (directly or through Popov),
particularly of the make-up
(1. How many liquidators?
2. How many Bolsheviks?
3. How many
      Braunists,[1]
etc., and of the plans of every group in detail).  

I enclose a note for Popov, to whom you will write in Russian.  

Give me the exact name of the pub, the street and
house number and the exact hour of the rendezvous.  

P.S. Am I to wire you or Herman or both of you?  

I have learned the timetable. It will be most convenient for me to
leave here early in the morning. I shall be in Berlin at 4.40 Nachmittag
and leave at 9.34 Abends from Friedrichstra&Bwhattheenbahnhof. Make an
appointment at once for us to meet (I must meet both you and
Herman), giving the hour (7â8--8Â 1/2 p.m.) and the pub
near Friedrichstra&Bwhattheenbabnhof. I shall wire you
the day of my departure and we shall meet at the
pub.[2] 

Awaiting an early reply,

 Yours,

 N.Â Lenin 

P.S. You can invent a personal excuse to start corresponding
with this Lettish Bolshevik.

11/I.  

Dear Comrade, 

As regards the arrangement for a rendezvous, you have done well.  

But as regards the delegate, I scold you severely. Apparently, he is
either a fool or an old woman, who falls for the gossip and slander of the
liquidator riffraff. Popov has been sent a formal power of attorney from
the C.C., and he has spoken only to Sauer (an official of the
Bureau Abroad!!). Obviously, the liquidators are slandering Popov.  

But that delegate of yours! A fine fellow indeed, if he believes the
liquidators. With warriors like these it would be ridiculous to start a war
against the liquidators. Such âwarriorsâ only deserve to lick the boots
of the liquidators all their lives.  

And what made you, knowing how unreliable this delegate was, write to
him that I needed the information??!

  Â  

The idea was that you ask him for the information. Now that
delegate will use your letter against me: that would be the limit!


I am terribly angry.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin

I received the C.O. PageÂ 8 is disgraceful. Why the devil didnât they let us
know? We could have found some more material!! And it should have been
dated not 28/XII, but earlier, for there is not a word about the
International Bureau.  

Many people are worrying over the decisions of the Bureau. Itâs
silly!  

An âexchange of opinionsâ is quite acceptable, and a resolution like
that should not have been turned down.  

That about the six being rejected is a lie. The six did
not even present a demand! According to the Rules they
couldnât:
if there are 7Â S.R.s in the Duma+6 S.D.s, then 1Â S.R. only has a
voice in the Inter-Parliamentary Commission.  

The I.S. Bureau can only offer us bons offices for talks, for an
âexchange of opinionsâ with other parties, groups, etc. This is all it
does. Only this! The calling of a conference, etc., is a stupid
Versimpelung of affairs by the liquidationist and philistine
riffraff. These liquidator people are just muck. And if we âexchange
opinionsâ theyâll be pleased!  

Who wrote the article in the C.O. on the Beilis case?  

Why werenât the proofs sent to us?? It should have been

  Â  

said that the bourgeois should form a republican party if they are
really against the Beilis case.

Dear Colleague, 

I have received your letter and hasten to reply that articles against
Bogdanovâs platitudes in philosophyÂ ... and Tectology are badly
needed. Please send your article to me direct, best of all by registered
book-post.[1] Articles on similar subjects are also needed; I shall be
very glad if you map them out and let me know.  

Greetings,

P.P.S. 

It has only just dawned on me, after rereading Kuznetsovâs telegram,
that it is evidently not a question of a report, but a meeting
commemorating 9.I! Announcing Malinovsky for such a meeting is
altogether impossible (for I have already written about
absolute legality, and I ask again and again that it be strictly
adhered to: neither the

  Â  

Party, nor groups, nor revolution, nor
Social-Democracy should ever be mentioned). As for me, you can put
me down on the list of speakers on JanuaryÂ 9 if it is useful for your
success (financially), but with my right to let you down
(privately, I declare that even if Iâm in Paris I wonât
go to the 9.1 meeting together with such a bunch of assorted animals
as the S.R.s, and Leder
&Â Co.).[2]

25/I.  

Dear Friend, 

I am writing you briefly on business: Victory!! Hurrah! The majority
are for us. I shall stay here about a week, and shall probably have a lot
of work to do.  

I am delighted that we have
won.[1] 

Sincerely yours,

Notes
 
 



[1]
On the eve of the Fourth Congress of the Social-Democrats of the
Lettish Region, the evening of JanuaryÂ 25 (N.Â S.), 1914, Lenin delivered a
lecture in Brussels for the Congress delegates on the national question,
which was listened to with tremendous interest. His meeting with the
delegates was exceptionally cordial.  

The Congress, which opened the next day, was a turning point in the
history of the S.D. Party of the Lettish Region. It adopted

 Â  

resolutions of a Bolshevik nature on practically all questions, except for
certain amendments which the Mensheviks and conciliators contrived to
wangle. The Congressâs greatest achievement was the election of a Central
Committee that took a Bolshevik stand and the passing of the Central Organ
Zihna into the control of Bolshevik adherents.

No.Â 2. 

 ...[1]
Just now (at 2Â p.m.) I received further mail by extra post. Again nothing
from you....  

I received a letter from Bukharin in Vienna. He has

  Â  

seen Buryanov, who was on his way from Plekhanov. Apparently, the
Plekhanovites and other non-factionists intend to undertake some sort of
joint âactionâ: I believe Plekhanov wants to publish a newspaper. Trotsky
and the local crowd are very shortly putting out a journal of their own,
Borba. They have effected a reconciliation with Luch; a
correspondence was conducted on this subject. The âpureâ liquidators will
remain in Nasha Zaryaâthatâs what that crowd âhopesâ for.


That is what Bukharin writes. This news is very important. Thereâs no
smoke without fire, and we are probably witnessing a new, wave of idiotic
conciliationist activity, which the I.S.B. is sure to take advantage of to
stage a comic act in the spirit of the 1910 January plenary session. Well,
weâre standing on our own legs now and weâll show up this riffraff.  

We must try our hardest (extremely tactfully, of course) to
collect and keep collecting all the information we can in Paris. That fool
Antonov cannot collect gossip from Steklov, but Steklov can get money out
of him. And we havenât a penny. Kamenev and his family are living on
nothing. See to it, therefore, that the C.O.A. does not give a
single kopek away to anybody but us. We shall
shortly be in desperate need of money for putting out the C.O., a
special pamphlet and one very important publication (absolument
entre nous: we will publish a special bulletin of the Central
Committee[3]âfor Russia weâve got a special transport
   possibility[2]

).



The conciliators of all shades are out to âcatchâ us! Bon! Weâll
catch those scoundrels, those ridiculous mountebanks. Theyâre getting stuck
in the mud of blocs with the liquidators? Don! Our tactic is: if the enemy
makes a false move, give him time to sink deeper into the mud. Thatâs where
we shall catch the scoundrels. Meantime, weâve got to gather strength and
moneyâweâve got to exercise restraint (to the utmost!)âto learn as much
as we can. Paris is a convenient centre for finding out things and for
âdiversionsâ. It is most desirable that the section
  Â  

adopt a sledge-hammer resolution against Kautsky (calling his
statement about the death of the Party shameless, insolent, monstrous,
ignorant). As for the few ânear-conciliatorsâ of our section, let
them get information from the Plekhanovites, the conciliators (Makar,
Lyova, Lozovsky &Â Co.) and the Trotskyitesâas well as the
Bundists and the Letts.  

Raise the question of lambasting Kautsky in the C.O.A. nd vote it: if
the majority turn it down, Iâll come and give that majority a leathering
theyâll remember for a long time. But I must know who that majority is
going to be, and who I have to deal with. So go full ahead!  

Nik. Vas. may receive at his address communications of great importance
to us (from the I.S.B. or from the Letts). It is very important that he
should hand them to you immediatelyâyou may open them in order to
wire their contents to me briefly: if it is not embarrassing,
arrange this, because just these days (while Malinovsky is here) a delay of
a day or two (=difference between a letter and a telegram) may be of
extremely vital significance. I think you could mention N.Â K., but
decide yourself, you know best.  

Let the C.O.A. consider who, in Paris, could help the six to write
their speeches. The need is great since the arrest of Krylenko. We shall
send the list of speeches. Assistance from all the vacillating
elements of the different groups is more convenient and more possible here.

26/I.  

Dear Friend, 

I was terribly glad to receive your nice, friendly, warm, charming
letter. I am inexpressibly grateful to you for it.

 

Things here have gone worse. One has already deserted to the
conciliatorsâso now we have no majority, and the conciliators will have
it all their own rotten way.  

I am leaving here on Tuesday or Wednesday next and will soon (except
for a lecture in Leipzig) be in Cracow.  

They write me from there that things are in a bad way with
Pravdaâthereâs no money. The circulation has dropped. A
deficit. Bad job.  

My new address: Oulianoff, rue Souveraine. 18.

 (Ixelles) Bruxelles.  

From the enclosed letter to Nik. Vas. you will find an answer to your
question whether I am angry on account of the unsuccessful lecture. I
should think I am! That idiot Antonov!! And the inability apart
from him to arrange practical matters.  

I received the express mail and have handed everything to
Malinovsky. He is here and will stay another 2â3 days.  

Take care of the kopeks in the C.O.A. and donât allow Antonov to
indulge his harebrained schemes.  

My very, very, very best regards, my dear friend. Excuse the haste and
brevity. I have no time.  

Yours,
V.U. 

The bulletin is the most important job of all. I beg you to
keep an eye on it yourself or get it going without Antonov.

Dear Friend, 

I shall not be in Paris any more.  The plan for publishing a lecture on
the national questionânothing doing.  
 

I repeat: not a kopek for anything except the bulletins of the
C.C. They are to be done at Riskinâs printing shop (not
Stepanâs). He is to be told to observe the strictest secrecy. You
yourself or Inessaâbut not Antonovâshould get back all the
MSS. and all the proof-sheets.  

Tomorrow I am sending material for the bulletin. Format =sheet of
9.I.1914. Four such pages, Typeâlarge for propaganda material
(pageÂ 1); small for pagesÂ 2 and 3.  

Do the job neatly, not Ã  la Antonov and without
Antonov. It is ridiculous and shameful to handle practical affairs
through that daydreamer. What is needed is a committee of
practical men and not a daydreamer (he is a nice, charming man, but
a preposterous dreamer).  

All the rest of the literature (the C.O., Programme, Rules,
Kamenev s pamphlet, the London
       minutes,[1]

etc., all) send without delay to Leipzig. Herrn
Koiransky. SophienstraÃk: 30I
rechts. Leipzig. (Indicate expÃ©diteur.) Notify me immediately
what has been sent and when, at the address: Mr.Â Wladimir
Oulianoff. Rue Souveraine. 18. Bruxelles (Ixelles).  

All the best,

 Yours,

 V.Â Lenin

There is an important job to be done in Parisâthe reorganisation of the
C.O.A. It is more important now than ever.  
 

We have started a new splendid transportation arrangement. A
new method, wonderful job, already tested (I had a letter
yesterday). Cheap. We are all delighted. They take 2 poods a
month.[2] 

We must publish. But we have neither money nor any
printing facilities outside of Paris. Therefore it is of primary
importance for the Party to arrange publication in Paris. I beg
you to do this both as a duty and a favour.  

Yesterday I sent N.Â Vâch the MSS. for No.Â 1 of the
Bulletin. I also sent instructions point by point.  

Read them. See that they are followed implicitly. Assure the
people over there that we shall give the C.O.A. the sackâno, reallyâand
appoint in its stead a committee of our own (on behalf of the
C.C.)âreally, I am not jokingâunless the business of publishing and
dispatching the Bulletin (a matter of primary importance
to the whole Party) is organised with meticulous care, not Ã  la
Antonov.  

I demand literally strict execution of my instructions
concerning the Bulletin. Thatâs one thing. Secondly, the
C.O.A. must set up a businesslike committee, so that Antonov (a
nice man and good comrade, but a good-for-nothing daydreamer and
preposterous fumble-fist) should have nothing to do with
the practical side of the business.  

Publication and printing should be done at a printing
house. The C.O.A. (+the committee) should exercise special
and daily control. Copy out the instructions and follow them
implicitly.  

Put this through the C.O.A. and get the committee going. I
repeat, this is a matter of primary importance. Answer me quickly
whether everything has been done. I am still here, in Brussels,
waiting for the proofs.  

I am enclosing a letter for Vl.Â Khr. Read it, give it to N.Â V. to read
and hand it over.  

Have the adjuvant committee appointed before I leave here (I
shall be here another week, until Tuesday or Wednesday).  

You will appreciate the importance of this business and spare no
efforts, I am sure.  

Yours,
 V.U. 
 


[[BOX-ENDS:

N.B. We havenât a penny. The C.O.A. must pay for everything.

]] 

P.S. Edisherov is dead timber. So is Kamsky. If you go away, who
remains?  

2 or 3 efficient hustlers should be put on the job to do all
the footwork, to visit the printing shop 2 or 3 times a day, to see to it
that the Bulletin is issued on time and keep in close touch with
us. As for the C.O.A., let it exercise âcontrolâ from above.

I.Â F. Popov, during his stay in Brussels in January 1914, made contact,
through the local organisations of the Belgian workerâs Party, with Belgian
seamen of a merchant vessel plying between Antwerp and Southern Russian
ports. Popov asked the seamen to ship illegal Party publications to
Russia. His proposal was approved by Lenin. During his visit to Brussels to
attend the Fourth Congress of the Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region
Lenin met two representatives of the Belgian seamen and talked with them
about conditions of the revolutionary work in Russia.

My dear Huysmans, 

I thank you for your kind
letter.[2] I am very sorry that you were not at the Congress of the
Lettish Social-Democrats the first day, as everyone expected, but on
Wednesday, just when you were not expected and when I had to absent myself
on business. I regret it all the more since I missed the opportunity of
hearing your very interesting speech.  

As regards the request of the Executive Committee that âI make up in
my own nameâ a brief report concerning the differences, I very much regret
that I am unable to meet your request.  

A report of this kind cannot be submitted âin my own nameâ, as I have
no right to do it. I am sure, moreover, that the important thing for the
Executive Committee of the I.S.B. is not âmy personalâ opinion, but the
opinion of the Central Committee. As soon as I arrive in Cracow, however,
and get in touch with all the members of the C.C., the report which the
Executive Committee asks for

  Â  

will be drawn up, endorsed by the Central Committee and forwarded to
 you.[1]


I cannot close this letter without thanking you for your kind
invitation. Unfortunately, I am engaged today with the Chairman of our
Partyâs Duma group at a congress sitting which happens to be discussing
this very question of unity in the Russian S.D.L. Party. I would therefore
like to put off our meeting (the Chairman of the Russian S.D.L. group would
also be glad to talk with you) and arrange it for tomorrow, 4Â p.m., at the
Maison du Peuple.  

Will you please wire me whether this is convenient for you, at the
address: Oulianoff. 18. Rue Souveraine. 18. Ixelles-Bruxelles.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin

In his letter dated JanuaryÂ 29 (N.S.), 1914, Camille Huysmans expressed
his regret at not having met Lenin at the Congress of the Social-Democrats
of the Lettish Region and asked Lenin personally to make a brief report on
the state of affairs within the R.S.D.L.P. before leaving Brussels. He
suggested meeting at 8.30 p.m. in the Maison du
peuple, Brussels.

Dear Comrade, 

Your silence surprises and depresses me extremely. We cannot work
without VorwÃ¤rts.  

I have been receiving VorwÃ¤rts free of charge for the last
3--4 years, right up to February 1914. SuddenlyÂ ... it has
stopped!!  

Whatâs the matter? I am not writing myself as I am afraid (if this is
an intrigue of the liquidators) to get a rude reply.  

But maybe it is simply an oversight?  

Will you please go to the forwarding office (on no account to
the editorial office) and find out what itâs all about and let me know
immediately.[1] Nadya wrote to you about this some time ago,
but there has been no reply. What is the matter? Are you ill? Please
respond!  

Yours,
Lenin 

I am enclosing a printed address for VorwÃ¤rts.  

N.B. ||| 

I repeat, I have been receiving it for 3â4 years for Sotsial-Demokrat,
Rabochaya Gazeta, Pravda in St.Â Petersburg, etc.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin received VorwÃ¤rts in exchange for Bolshevik
publications.  V.Â M. Kasparov answered Lenin on MarchÂ 4 (N.S.), 1914, that
he had called at the VorwÃ¤rts Forwarding Office where he had
been told that literature was being sent to Lenin regularly, and if he did
not receive it, that meant it was being confiscated.

Dear Friend, 

 1st.[1]

Bogdanovâs departure is said to have caused displeasure (among the
intellectualist riffraff, apparently). That âgood soulâ of ours,
Galyorka, is moping, I believe. The Priboi
people[2] voted for Bogdanov.  
 

They argue (an old trick of these intellectualist mischief-makers) that
there are workers supporting Vperyod every where (why werenât they
seen anywhere?...). Thatâs all bosh, of course. The story of the
Vperyod groupâs adventurism will have to be given in
Prosveshcheniye. But now it is necessary that you should
(1) take action. The thing has to be explained, the stupid defenders of
Vperyodism and Bogdanov (Dansky is one of them, apparently) must be
challenged and warned.
(2) You must get your letter about An Introduction to Political
Economy[3] published for certain. Write immediately. If yours
doesnât go, Iâll send in mine.  

2nd. How about the collection of articles? Drop me a line (Marxism
and
Liquidationism).[4] 

3rd. What a scandal in the committees of the Literary Society (the
campaign against the Press
Bill)[5].... Bloc of the liberals+liquidators (Kheisin, Stiva Novich,
Guliko). And N.Â D. Sokolov there too.... Take action. Kick him out. Most
important of allâlaunch a campaign against the liquidators for this. Let
me know.  

4th. What about the speeches? The budget will be before the Duma only
on 20.III, old style. Am I right? Drop me a line about this.  
 

Notes
 

[1]
Erroneously given as â2ndâ in the typewritten copy.âEd.

 



[2]
Priboi peopleâcontributors to and members of the staff of
the legal Bolshevik publishing house Priboi. This publishing business was
founded in St.Â Petersburg at the beginning of 1913 and was controlled by
the C.C. of the Party. Owing to increased persecution of the labour press
by the tsarist government following the outbreak of the war Priboi had to
close down and did not resume publishing activities until March 1917. In
1918 Priboi merged with the publishing house Kommunist, which was formed as
a result of the merger of various publishing houses (Volna, Zhizn i Znaniye
and others).





[3]
Kamenevâs article on A.Â Bogdanovâs book An Introduction to
 Â  

Political Economy issued by the Priboi publishing House appeared
in the journal Prosveshcheniye No.Â 3 for March 1914.





[4]
Marxism and Liquidationism. A Symposium of Articles on the
Fundamental Issues of the Modern Labour Movement. PartÂ II was
published in July 1914 by Priboi, the Partyâs publishing house. The
collection was to have been in two parts, whose contents were announced in
the newspaper Put Pravdy No.Â 42, MarchÂ 21, 1914.  

PartÂ I of the collection did not appear. Several dozen copies of
PartÂ II, which the publishers were late in taking delivery of from the
printers, were confiscated. The bulk of the edition, how ever, was
distributed. PartÂ II contained fourteen articles by Lenin besides the
preface and the conclusion, which were also written by him.





[5]
This refers to a meeting called by the All-Russia Literary Society in
January 1914 in connection with the increased persecution of the press and
the reactionary bill on the press which the government was preparing. The
decisive role at this meeting was played by the representatives of the
liberals and liquidators a liberal resolution was adopted.

 To Andrei
    Nikolayevich,[1]

private

Dear Colleague, 

I sent you today another article, Bukharinâs. All for
       No.Â 2.[2]

I hope this will keep you going for the time being.

  Â  

Re Bogdanovâs departure, there is apparently a quite erroneous opinion,
which must be combated.  

1. Who has gone because of him? No one. Consequently, it looks as if we
have antagonised somebody; this lie must be disproved.  

2. He is himself a minus (and not an 0). I am surprised that they vote
for Bogdanov in Priboi without defending his false platitudes, without
defending his platitudes in An Introduction to Political
Economy. This is uncollegiate. You have
forgotten. Write. Explain. Argue. Fancy voting with out a collegiate
exchange of opinions! Cowardly. Crazy. Vulgar. Harmful. Let them explain
art.
G.Â G.,[3]

why they drag rot propaganda into the workersâ midst.  

3. There is a decision for the Vperyod group. This is not
true. Where is it? Give me their letters to Pravda.... There
arenât any. These are fairy-tales of the soft-hearted muddleheads from
among the intelligentsia....  

I am sending only articles approved by the Editorial Board. Including
Pavlovâs article. It is suitable. Bogdanov is a nonentity, whom it is
ridiculous to give much attention to.

Dear Fyodor Nikitich, 

I received your letter and am very glad that you are fixed up.  

Nowâquiet, sunshine, sleep, food. Take care of all this. Do
they give you enough to eat?  

You should drink more milk. Do you?  

You should weigh yourself once a week and make a note of it each time.

 

You should go and see a local doctor at least once in 10 days, so that
he can check the progress of your cure. Have you the doctorâs address? If
you havenât, write to me and I shall find it out for you.  

The main thing is sleep (how many
   [hours][1]
do you sleep?), sun and [food], especially milk.  

Write to me about this in detail.  

Nadya sends her regards. All the best, and wishing you a good rest.


Yours,
 Lenin 

P.S. You donât feel too lonely, do you? If you do, I can arrange for
friends from Geneva and Lausanne to visit you. Wouldnât visitors tire you?
Write!  

Is there a bath in your pension?

2/III. 1914 

Dear Friend, 

We are still having hard timesâno newspaper. One senses a sharp
change in the whole system of work after Kamenevâs departure, and
where the new line is leading and how it will shape, no
one can tell.  

From St.Â Petersburg we have had news 1) from Mikh. Step. (Olminsky),
who complains that we called Bogdanov names and drove him out, that the
people over there are lamenting, etc. My, what a snivelling milksop that
dear M.Â St. of ours is!  

2) There has been a letter from the St.Â Petersburg Commit tee or rather
about the St.Â Petersburg Committee. It is alive and working well. This is
very pleasant news.  
 

3) A letter from a C.C. man, who is âmaking a comebackâ in Siberia
after an interval of 2 years (prison and exile).  

Before I forgetâdo you know whatâs the matter with Popov in Brussels?
He hasnât answered my urgent and important letters
2â3 weeks (!!). And I need him! Is he ill? Or has that
 love-story[1]

of his done something to him, driven him out of Brussels, etc.? If you know
nothing, will you please do this: wait a couple of days; if, during that
time, you do not hear anything new from me, write to him in Brussels
through other friends and also ask them about him, so that I know
definitely what itâs all about. Must be something in credible and
impossible!  

If you know anything about him, drop me a line at once.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 V.Â U. 

P.S. Samoilov writes that he feels rather lonely in Montreux. I am
anxious to find a good doctor to look after him there (nervous
complaint). Does Kamsky know anyone?

Dear Friends, 

I have had no news from you for a long time. Things are none too
good. Strictly speaking, during the last few months following the arrests,
you have noÂ ... no collegium for organisational work. This is simply an
impossible situation. I think you should co-opt 3â4 St.Â Petersburg workers

  Â  

(including a shop-assistant) as has been rightly pointed out.... You wonât
be able to get things moving otherwise. The co-opted men should be kept
strictly separate and apart from the co-operative board and the legal
enterprises. Answer quickly. We have asked for someone to be sent here, but
so far there is no reply.  

Furtherâwe earnestly ask you to put us in touch directly with the
P.Â C. This is extremely important. Then, as regards the
âtransporterâ. Has No.Â 1 of the Bulletin been received?  Whatâs
happened to the man, why doesnât he write? Things have been at a standstill
for close on a month. Itâs unpardonable. Make inquiries, find outâis he
safe, alive? Kostya should know what his name is.  

Finally, about money, too, we would ask you to answer:
1) What definitely have you learned about Pryanik? Find out and hurry them
up. Has a round been made of the rich to collect money? Write about
this...[2] We are absolutely moneyless, and havenât a penny for
organisational trips and all organisational work. There are people who
could be utilisedÂ ... but owing to the lack of funds we cannot do anything
so far. Write whether you are satisfied with Volkov, whether things have
been put right, particularly the speeches.  

Regards to everybody,

 Frey

To Citizen Huysmans

Cracow, MarchÂ 7, 1914 

Dear Huysmans, 

First of all, leaving aside the altogether objectionable tone of your
letter,[3] I will state the facts in regard to my report.  
 

On FebruaryÂ 2, 1914 I left Brussels; as promised, my re port
had already been written. A quarter of an hour before my departure
I wrote you a letter (in the presence of Comrade Popov) at a
cafÃ© near the Northern Railway Station; in that letter I informed
you that my report was already prepared (20 small pages and the
resolution of the Lettish
       Congress[1]

)

and that Comrade Popov had undertaken to translate it and deliver it to
      you.[2]


The address of the cafÃ© was printed on the envelope of this
letter, and if the letter has not been delivered to you I shall lodge a
protest with the Brussels Post Office.  

If you did receive this letter, I am greatly astonished that you do not
mention it.  

If Comrade Popov has not yet forwarded you a translation of my report,
then I am completely at a loss. I wrote to him several times, believing him
to have fallen ill, since he has not written to me for several weeks now.


Today I am sending him another registered letter, Re corded Delivery,
in order to get to the bottom of this strange affair. I am also writing to
Comrade Karlson (256. Rue Grau. Bruxelles) asking him to call on Popov
personally.  

Secondly, the expressions you use in your letter (âtergiversationâ,
âpolicy of procrastinationâ, etc.) are insulting and you have no right to
employ them towards a comrade. I must ask you therefore to take back these
expressions without reserve. Unless you do so, this letter to you will be
my last.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin

On MarchÂ 3 (N.S.), 1914, Camille Huysmans sent a letter to Lenin
demanding that his report to the International Socialist Bureau be
forwarded to him as quickly as possible and telling ham that information
concerning the situation within the R.S.D.L.P. had been received from the
liquidators.

Dear Comrade Rudis, I am very much surprised at your writing: âI
cannot understand Leninâs attitude in this matterâ (i.Â e., my attitude
towards the conciliator resolutions of the Lettish
Congress[1]).  

Didnât Herman tell you that I fought tooth and nail? The conciliators
won, however. We must fight on now, but fight with sense.  

The arrests donât surprise me, since the Congress was arranged by the
liquidators with an outrageous lack of secrecy. The whole of
Brussels knew about it! The whole of Paris!  

This will be a lessonâbeware of the liquidators!  

Show this letter to Herman. I am waiting for news as to when the
resolutions are to be published. Pravda should do this before
anybody
else.[2] 

N.Â K. sends her regards.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In his letter of MarchÂ 12 (N.S.), 1914, I.Â Rudis-Gipslis criticised the
conciliatory nature of some of the resolutions adopted at the Fourth
Congress of the Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region, and especially the
inclusion in the resolution on the attitude to the R.S.D.L.P. of the
proposal by the conciliators of J.Â Janson-Braun which obliged the
Social-Democrats of the Lettish Region temporarily, âuntil the business of
unification was on firm groundâ, to abstain from organisational contacts
with either the C.C. or the O.C. He reported that the comrades in the local
areas, too, were displeased with the conciliatory resolutions of the
congress and believed that the fight against the conciliators would have to
go on.





[2]
Articles on the Fourth Congress of the Social-Democrats of the Lettish
Region citing resolutions of the congress were published

 Â  

in the supplement to No.Â 50 of Put Pravdy, for March 30, 1914
under the heading âThe Baltic Regionâ.

15/III.1914 

Dear Huysmans, 

I received at last Popovâs explanation and his statement that the
report had at last been sent. As you are âmerely the secretary (and a good
fellow)â and not a âgrandissime seigneurâ, I can say that had the letter
you sent to Popov on MarchÂ 10, 1914 been sent a week or two earlier, this
incident would never have occurred.  

On receiving your witty and friendly
letter,[1] however, I have no wish to raise any question and am
particularly pleased to consider the incident definitely closed.  

Yours,
V.L. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In his letter of MarchÂ 10 (N.S.), 1914, Huysmans asked I.Â F. Popov to
deliver Leninâs report to the International Socialist Bureau as soon as
possible.  

The same day Huysmans wrote to Lenin apologising for the ironical tone
of his previous letter written in an unofficial capacity.

It would be good now to have a Ukrainian Social-Democratic group
of our own, however small. Write whether you could make contacts
and do something in this direction.  

What a magnificent victory at the Insurance Council
elections![4] Delightful! Try and
       lancer[2]

a report about this in the French socialist (or trade union) press. And how
much better-looking Pravda has become under
  brother[3]

âitâs

getting to be a real beauty! It does you good to look at it. For the
first time we see the hand of a cultured, knowledge able editor on the
spot.  

What impression did le geste de
M-meÂ Caillaux[5] make on you?  Frankly, I canât get rid of a certain
feeling of sympathy. I thought only venality, cowardice and
meanness were rife in these circles. And suddenly this plucky woman goes
and delivers, a resolute le\cÂ con!! I wonder what the jury will have to say
and what the political consequences will be. Will
Caillaux resign? Will the Radicals be overthrown?  

All the very best,

 Yours,

Elections to the Insurance Council in St.Â Petersburg were bold
on MarchÂ 2 (15), 1914. A sharp struggle developed around these elections
between the Bolsheviks on the one hand, and the liquidators and
Socialist-Revolutionaries on the other. The liquidators suffered complete
defeat at these elections, three-fourths of the electorsâ meeting declaring
in favour of the Bolsheviksâ electoral platform and rejecting that proposed
by the bloc of the liquidators and Socialist-Revolutionaries. The defeat of
the liquidators was further demonstrated at the elections to the All-Russia
Insurance Agency. Of the 57 delegates 82 perÂ cent were Pravdists.

M-me Caillauxâthe wife of Joseph Caillaux, French statesman,
Radical, Minister of Finance in 1913. In response to the hounding campaign
raised against him by the nationalist Gaston Calmette editor of Le
Figaro, M-me Caillaux fired at Calmette in March 1914 and mortally
wounded him. Joseph Caillaux was obliged to resign.

24/III. 1914 

Dear Colleague, 

I think you overdid the secrecy line a bit, and for a long time you had
me guessing who you were.  
 

I thank you very much for your
    communication.[1]

It is very important. I believe that on the terms you mention, your
participation was quite correct and useful for the cause. Your request (to
state in case of need that you played no game behind the backs of
like-minded comrades) I shall gladly comply with, in the expectation,
naturally, of receiving detailed information from you. I repeat,
this is a very important matter, regarded as a symptom; your remarks
concerning âthe great interest of observing the process of a new stir-upâ
are perfectly correct. It is vitally essential that we be informed about
this process.  

The only mistake on your part is, to my mind, the invitation of âa big
manâ, etc., âwith strong leanings towards the Mensheviks and
punctiliously correctâ, etc. âIn case of need,â you write, âhe will
state how I bore myself at the meetings.â I believe these gentlemenâs idea
of correctness differs essentially from our own. Thatâs one thing. They are
incapable of understanding what it means to betray the workers to the
bourgeoisie. Further, you will never need a defence by such a
fellow. The very assumption of the idea of such a defence is a confession
(a needless confession) of the weakness and instability of your position,
etc. It perverts the purpose and meaning of your participation in the
meetings. A person capable of directly informing the centre of the
organised force gathers information as to the attitude of mind of the
vacillating elements and even of the enemies. Thereâs nothing wrong in this
at all. But to invite (thus turning into a âforceâ!!) a trashy
intellectual, who is incapable of distinguishing the bourgeoisie from its
antipode, was a mistake. It is this that will probably lead to idle talk,
gossip and squabbles.  

But this mistake is unimportant. The business itself (your and our
information) is far more important.  

Please write more often and establish proper contacts for this
purpose. Answer as quickly as possible. Couldnât we get some money from the
      âtypeâ?[2]

Itâs badly needed. Itâs not worth taking less than 10,000
rubles. Answer. Also

  Â  

let me know how frankly you can talk: a) with the âtypeâ, b) with his
various friends, acquaintances, etc., c) with all the participants of the
âmeetingsâ. I think you should single out those one can talk with openly
and openly put to them questions such as: aa) We are going to the limit of
such-and-such methods of struggle; can we know what your limits are?
Unofficially, privately!! bb) We are contributing so-and-so in the way of
forces, means and so on; can we know what your contribution to the struggle
âoutside the Dumaâ is likely to be? You say that the âtypeâ considers
that âthe liberals changed front too early in 1905ââwell then, get to
know whether everybody thinks this and for what length of time
approximately they intend to put off the change of front (this, of
course, can be expressed not in terms of time, but in terms of political
changes).  

cc) Are they capable of giving money?  

dd) â â â creating an illegal organ?  

and so on.  

Our aim is to inform ourselves and spur them on to give every possible
active assistance to the revolution, with the question concerning the
revolution being put as frankly and bluntly as possible (to a or to b or
even to c as you know best). If possible, it would be a good idea for you
to deliver a report, on the theses of which I would gladly give my opinion,
if need be.

 ...[1]
In regard to the opportunism of the German opportunists, Grigory and I are
of one mind, I believe, and I have met no differences in the appraisal of
their infamy.  (I did not read the article on âThe New
Currentsâ.)  
 

The Germans virtually have 2 parties, and this has to be borne
in mind without trying to shield the opportunists (the way Neue Zeit
and Kautsky are now doing).  

But it is incorrect to say that the German party is the most
opportunist party in Europe. It is nonetheless the best party, and our task
is to adopt from the Germans all that is most valuable (the mass
of newspapers, the large party membership, the mass membership of the trade
unions, the systematic subscription to the newspapers, strict control over
the parliamentariansâall the same the Germans are better at this
control than the French and Italians, not to mention Britainâand so on),
adopt all this without playing up to the opportunists.  

We should not cover up the opportunists from Sozialistische
Monatshefte[4] (they have heaps of leaders there)âthe
way Neue Zeit and Kautsky and the German Vorstand are
doingâbut hound them with all our might. This is what Grigory
always does in his articles about the Germans. I am now reading Legien (the
trade union leader) on his visit to America and intend to pitch into that
mean opportunist good and
       proper.[2]


All the very best,

 Yours,

 V.U. 

Samoilov will probably change his address in a day or two. I shall
write you as soon as I know
 it.[3]

Saturday, 11/IV. 1914 

Dear Friend, 

I still do not know whether you received my letters in which I wrote
about the loss of the letter concerning Rakhmetov, and, what you have done
in this connection.  

The package (containing, the first part of the collection The
Beginning[1]) has been received by you, but very late. If
you still have the wrapper with the postmarks on it, I would advise you to
lodge a complaint with the ministry, enclosing the wrapper. The loss of the
letter concerning Rakhmetov is simply exasperating, and I consider
complaints, protests, etc., absolutely necessary. I have a strong suspicion
that the letters of the Russian emigrants are stolen in Paris (and taken by
the police to be read before delivery to the addressees). The dates on
which letters are received should be kept track of.  

I hope you have finished with Alexinsky? The only remedy in
such cases (I speak from my own long, over 15 years, experience)
is an absolute boycott by the entire section (but I suppose there
are a lot of snivellers in it, who wonât apply a boycott and so will have
themselves to blame for the
âsquabblesâ).[2] 

I am awfully glad that your children are coming to see you and that you
will soon go off to spend the summer with them.  

All the very, very best,

 Yours,


V.U. 

P.S. I apologise for todayâs brief letter. I am in a great hurry.  

I have not yet received the collection (The Beginning).  

Is it the post again!??  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The collection The Beginning was published in Saratov in
1914. The first item in this collection was an article by N.Â Vladimirov
âEncounters and Reflectionsâ, describing meetings with G.Â V. Plekhanov,
P.Â B. Axelrod, V.Â I. Lenin, L.Â Martov, A.Â N. Potresov and Maxim Gorky.





[2]
This refers to the campaign started against A.Â V. Antonov (Britman), a
member of the Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. Organisation Abroad, by the
Vperyod group and G.Â A. Alexinsky, who accused him of betraying,
during the interrogation, his comrades charged with him in connection with
the case of the Kronstadt organisation of the R.S.D.L.P. in 1906. This
accusation was quashed as far back as in 1907 by the decision of a
committee of ten political convicts (Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and non-party
people) of whom six were former codefendants in the trial. The committeeâs
decision was communicated the same year to Lenin and the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P., who considered Antonov not guilty and did not

 Â  

restrict his rights as a Party member. Alexinsky raised the âAntonov
caseâ again in 1912â14 with the aim of using it against the Bolsheviks,
who, he alleged, had been âshielding a traitorâ.  

On AprilÂ 18 (N.S.), 1914, the Paris section of the
R.S.D.L.P. Organisation Abroad adopted a resolution expressing indignation
at Alexinskyâs behaviour and breaking off all relations with him.  On
JuneÂ 10, 1914, the Committee of the Organisations abroad passed a
resolution calling on the socialist organisations in Paris and all Party
centres (Russian and national) to vigorously rebuff the provocative tricks
of Alexinsky and members of the Vperyod group, to deny recognition
of the Vperyod group as a political organisation and not to enter
into any relations with it. On JuneÂ 20 this resolution was supported by a
general meeting of the Paris section of the R.S.D.L.P. Organisation
Abroad. This fact was mentioned by Lenin in the Report of the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. to the Brussels Conference (see present edition, Vol.Â 20,
p.Â 525).

Dear G.Â L., 

Why donât you answer about Samoilov (you must fix him up with some
manual workâfind some farmer in the environs or a market-gardener through
the socialists[3]âand about
Zgr.[2]

?).

On MayÂ 3 (N.S.), 1914, F.Â N. Samoilov wrote Lenin that he was in the
Berne town sanatorium, and that the doctorâa specialist in nervous
diseasesâadvised him to do a little manual work.  

G.Â L. Shklovsky wrote to Lenin on May 12 that Samoilov had been fixed
up with work in the open air.

 ...[1]
and not in 1912, but in 1911) we in the editorial office of
Sotsial-Demokrat received Vinnichenkoâs pamphlet in Russian
devoted to a defence against the accusations levelled at him by the
Social-Democrats for âHonesty to Oneselfâ. Vinnichenko asked for an
answer in writing and in print. I remember being impressed by the pamphlet,
and I wanted to write about it, but was prevented by all kinds of petty
affairs (oh, those âpetty affairsâ, those apologies for business,
imitation products of business, a hindrance to business, how I hate fuss
and bustle and petty affairs, and how tied I am to them inseparably and for
all time!!  Thatâs a sign more that I am lazy and tired and badly
humoured. Generally I like my profession and now I often almost
hate
       it[2]

).

By the way, I mislaid that pamphlet (published in Lvov) and have forgotten
its title. Find it if you can, read it and send it to me.  

I thought Vinnichenko sincere and naive when he puts the question:
âDoes a Social-Democrat have the right (!! sic!!) to visit a brothel?â
and keeps harping on this question, but all the time
individually. He is sort of half-anarchist or total anarchist, and
the Vperyodists must bamboozle him. He once read a lecture in Paris on
âHonesty to Oneselfâ with Lunacharsky in the chair, did he not? Or are
things in such a way that Lunacharsky is for Vinnichenko, while
Alexinsky is against? I would like to know some more details about
      it.[3]


Before leaving Paris you
     must[4]

discuss with Nik. Vas., Kamsky and Ludmila the question of the delegation
to the Vienna congress. It is most desirable to have as many delegates as
possible. The difficulty is money (expenses for the trip+15
frs. for a ticket to the congress). The task is: 1) to search in advance
for people fit to be delegates

  Â  

and able to travel at their own expense; 2) to raise more money; 3) to find
out how much NN, MM, etc., are short of.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

Lenin

Dear Friend, 

I received your letter of 15/V. Regarding the Lettish supplement to
Pravda, I have my doubts. Isnât it too early? And generally is it
proper for Russians to interfere in Lettish affairs in this form?  

Send me, if possible, a translation (1) of your unpublished articles,
(2) of the worst of the âconciliatorâ articles in
Zihna[1] and the present legal Lettish newspaper.  

The C.O. will soon come out. Send in an article on the Lettish
Congress.  

I congratulate you on the successful May Day rally, especially in Riga
and St.Â Petersburg!  

My regards to you and Herman (donât tell me you have quarrelled with
him!).  

Yours,
 Lenin

Zhina (Struggle)âa newspaper, Central Organ of the Lettish
Social-Democrats; founded in March 1904. Up to August 1909 it appeared
illegally at great intervals in Riga and subsequently abroad. From April
1917 it was published legally in Petrograd as the Central Organ of the
Latvian Bolsheviks, and afterwards in Riga and other cities. In August
1919, after the temporary victory of the counter-revolution in Latvia, it
began to appear again illegally in Riga. With the victory of Soviet rule in
Latvia in June 1940 it became the organ of the C.C. of the Communist Party
of Latvia and the Supreme Soviet of the Latvian S.S.R.

19/V. 1914 

Dear Friend, 

I have a favour to ask of you. Is Volume One of Rubakinâs Among
Books available in your library or can you get it for me in
Switzerland?  

By the way, wasnât it you who sent me Volume
One?[2] If it was, then I did not refund your postal expenses!! And you
didnât remind me. Drop me a line, please, and Iâll send you the money for
both volumes. (I need VolumeÂ I for only a short time.)  

Do you always get Put Pravdy?  

What has happened to that young Bolshevik, the Wittmarist, that nervous
vegetarian I met at your place a year
 ago?[1]


Could any of your acquaintances travel to Vienna as delegates at
their own expense (we have no money,
alas!)?[3] Look around, find out. We must make up a delegation.  

All the very best. Regards to Comrade Olga. N.Â K. also sends you both
her regards.  

Yours,
Lenin

25/V. 1914 

Dear
    Friend,[1]


The Malinovsky affair is warming up. He is not here. It looks like
âflightâ.[5] Naturally, this gives food for the worst
thoughts. Alexei wires from Paris that the Russian

  Â  

newspapers are wiring Burtsev that Malinovsky is accused of being a
provocateur.  

You can imagine what it means!! Very improbable but we are obliged
to control all
       âouÃ¯-direâ.[2]
Wiring does not cease between
    Poronin,[3]

St.Â Petersburg, et Paris. Petrovsky wires today that âslanderous rumours
dispelled. Liquidators conducting vicious campaignâ.  

Russkoye Slovo wires Burtsev that the suspicions have been
largely dispelled, but âother papers (???) (liquidatorsâ???) are
continuing their accusations 

You can easily imagine how much I am
    worried.[4]


Yours,
 V.Â I.

In May 1914, Malinovsky, fearing exposure, resigned his office as Duma
deputy and left the country. Subsequently it was discovered that Malinovsky
had been an agent provocateur. In 1918 he was sentenced to death by the
Supreme Tribunal of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and shot.

My dear G. I., 

We have just received from you your literary debt. Thanks. We are
surprised at the absence of news and letters.  

Regards and best wishes,

 V.Â Lenin 

A wishâthat you bear the irresponsible departure of Malinovsky more
firmly, and stop worrying. No need to expel him. He has removed
himself. Condemned. Political suicide. What other punishment can there be?
Of what use? Do not worry. Speeches excellent. Boldly forward. The
liquidators are not branded enough for their mud-slinging and
dirt. Thatâs what they should daily be calledâgarbage news

  Â  

paper, garbage writers. Their job is to fling mud. Ours is to do the
work. We have done with Malinovsky. He has gone under. Suicide. Why chew
the rag, why waste time over it? To work, down with garbage writers!

... Is it true that there are conciliationist tendencies among
prominent Pravdist workers, that one of themâby the name of Malinin or
Dolininâhad a long talk about this with a contributor to the newspaper,
the writer M.Â N.? It is very important to know whether this is a trendâIf
so, what sort

  Â  

of trend, what it stands for, what its terms of unity areâor just an
individual and a casual fantasy.  

As regards Plekhanov in his
Yedinstvo,[2] you should adopt straightaway a tone to the
effect that this distinguished theoretician, who has great services to his
credit in the struggle against opportunism, Bernstein and the philosophers
of anti-Marxismâa man whose mistakes in tactics during 1903â07 did not
prevent him during the hard times of 1908â12 from singing the praises of
the âundergroundâ and exposing its enemies and opponents, that this man
now, unfortunately, is again revealing his weak side. The utter vagueness
of his ideas is due, perhaps, partly to his being totally uninformed:
it is not clear whom he wants unity withâwith the Narodniks (see
Sovremennik, in which the Himmers are already parading his name)
or with the liquidators of Nasha Zarya and Mr.Â Potresov, and on
what conditions? And, having put these questions, you should calmly state
that the reader will hardly get a clear answer to these natural questions,
since we know from the literature that it is these very questions
Plekhanov is vague about.  

Again my greetings and congratulations on your huge success (but the
business side, the business!!!) and my best wishes.  

Contributor to Put Pravdy 

The tone of the newspaper, pending the Vienna congress, should be
altered. We are in for a period of struggle. We must pull no punches at the
insolent beggars of the different little groups, we must nip in the bud
their attempts at disorganisation. They dare to split the
    four-fifths!![1]

Drop me a line whether you agree, and when you are issuing.  

You should hit out at the liquidators and the little groups at once and
as hard as possible: the 40,000 must know exactly where we stand. It is our
duty to make a laughingstock of the adventurists....

Dear
     Friend,[1]


Information has been received today that the Executive Committee of the
I.S.B. is calling what is known as the Unity Conference in Brussels on
JulyÂ 16, 17 and
 18.[2]


A delegation must be formed. It is doubtful whether we shall
go. Grigory maybe, but even he wonât, as likely as not.  

On behalf of the C.C. I want to ask you to consent to be a member of
the delegation. We shall pay the expenses of the journey.  

We shall work out the tactics in minute detail.  

If you have the slightest chance to fix up the children for 6â7 days
(or even less, since the conference will last 3Â days), I would ask you to agree. You are well up in the business,
you speak French perfectly, and you read Pravda. We also have in
mind Popov, Kamsky and Yuri. Letters have been sent to all of them.  

So answer at once, without an hourâs delay. Consent!  

Very
    truly,[3]
 V.Â I. 

We havenât decided yet about the delegation and havenât formed it. We
are searching. Itâs all at the stage of preliminary talks so
far. But time is short.  

We must make great haste!!  

Consent, do! It will make a good change for you and you will help the
cause!!  

Grigoryâs wife is ill. I donât want to go âon principleâ. Apparently
the Germans (the resentful Kautsky & Co.) are out to annoy us. Soit! We
shall calmly (I am no good for that), on behalf of the eight-tenths
majority, propose our conditions in the most polite (I am no good for that
either)

  Â  

French. You are more sure of yourself now, you have been reading,lectures,
and could carry this through splendidly! If the dear comrades want
unity, then here are the conditions of the majority of
class-conscious workers in Russia. They can either take them or leave
them!!  

âTheyâ are out to give âbattleâ (decisive battle) to us in
Vienna. An empty threat!! They canât do anything!!

Dear Comrade, 

On behalf of the Central Committee I must inform you that our C.C., by
a special resolution, has recognised it quite impossible to attend the
Brussels conference of July 16â18 unless the Polish opposition is invited
on equal terms with the other participants of the
meeting.[1] The discussion of even Russian affairs, let alone Polish,
is simply impossible for us without the participation of the only real
national organisation of the Social-Democratic workers in Russian Poland.


I would be greatly obliged, dear comrade, if you would answer this
letter by wire. I trust there can be no obstacles to inviting the
above-mentioned organisation.  

We should very much like to know exactly what organisations and
individuals you have invited, 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On the insistence of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., the âPolish oppositionâ
(J.Â S. Hanecki, A.Â M. Malecki and others) received an invitation from the
I.S.B. to attend the Brussels âUnityâ Conference.

Dear Friend, 

I have yesterday made a walk in the mountains (the weather is good
after weeks of rain), & therefore could not answer yesterday your
letter. Iâm extremely glad that you all are well, no illness,
& that you are busy.  

For the congress Iâd like to beg you to prepare the most important
citations (quotations) & documents against liquidateurs. Paris & I would help
you. Stockholm minutesâquotations about the underground
(No.Â 3 of Nasha
Zarya,[4] etc.)âour C.O. and major articles against the
  liquidators.[1]

It is possible that you will be obliged to be member of the âconferenceâ
(of all âfractionsâ) & to act publicly as accusator of liquid. &
as a partisan (more than this: as a representative) of the C.C.  

About âthrashingâ of Alex. Iâve written not a word to Parisians &
will not write. But... have you seen the cutting Iâve sent
you?[2]

Nik. Vas. was wrong: he has helped Ax-ky,
who will now play a role of a âvictimâ. It is clear. Boycott & common
resolution. Thatâs good. Thrashing is bad: now all
outsiders[3]

will be against Nik. Vas. And the âmoeursâ in the emigration
would get quite hooligan, if thrashing would get common.... Resolutions,
boycottâthat is the single convenient measures....  

Nothing new here. Guests not yet arrived. The wife of Grigory still ill
in hospital.  

Yours truly, truly,

 V.Â I.

 Wishing you all good & best....

Dear
     Friend,[1]


I am terribly afraid that you will refuse to go to Brussels, and thus
place us in an absolutely impossible position. And so I have
thought up another âcompromiseâ, which you will simply be unable to
refuse.  

Nadya believes your elder children have arrived already, and you could
easily leave them for 3Â days (or take Andrei with you).  

In the event of the elder children not having arrived and it being
absolutely impossible for you to leave the children for 3Â days, I
suggest that you go for one day (the 16th, even for half a
day, to read the report), either leaving the children for the day, or
even sending for Kâvich for that day at an extremity. (We shall pay the
expenses.)  

You see, itâs extremely important that the main report, at
least, should be read really effectively. And for that
purpose excellent French is definitely needed, otherwise the
effect will be nilâFrench, because otherwise nine-tenths will be
lost in translation for the very Executive Committee for whom
the effect is primarily intended (the Germans are hopeless,
and they may not be there).  

Besides excellent French, of course, an understanding of
essentials and proper tact are needed. You are the only suitable
person. So pleaseâI beg you most earnestlyâconsent, if only for
one day (you will read the report and apologise, pleading illness in the
family, and go away, handing things over to Popov). If you have already
refused by letter, wire (Uljanow. Poroninâ10 words cost 60Â heller):
âagree one dayâ, âagree 16 onlyâ, etc.  

All the very best. Always sincerely yours,

 V.Â I. 

We shall write the C.C.âs
       report.[2]

Your job will be to

  Â  

translate it and read it with commentaries, which we shall agree
on.  


P.S. The new chairman is not here but must come very
      soon.[3]


Kamsky, Popov, you. Safarov only as secretaryâthatâs how I plan the
delegation.  

I hope you will not now decline my demand. A good âlectureâ in
French, in good French will help our party
   extremely.[4]


I am worried very much about Brussels. Only you could carry it
off wonderfully. Grigory will hardly be able to goâZina is still in
hospital (a bad âphlegmonâ) and his nerves have gone to pieces. I am
no good here. Besides, Grigory speaks only German (and a poor German
at that), and for us not to have a French speaker is tantamount to losing
nine-tenths!!

Dear Suren, 

I am surprised that you have not answered (or not noticed) the
important point of the Bill. How to determine the proportionate
share of expenditure on the education of different nations? (if this share
is required to be not lower than the share of the given nation in the
population).  

You should consider this. Collect data. Go through the literature. Go
into details. Give examples in figures from the life of the Caucasus.  

Yet not a word from you about this!  
 

To include autonomy in self-determination is wrong. It is a
downright error. See my articles in
      Prosveshcheniye.[1]

You are vacillating and âsearchingâ for something. Itâs wrong. You should
understand the Programme and stand for it.  

Write me a criticism of my articles in Prosveshcheniye, and
weâll talk it over.  

It is shameful to stand for an official language. It is a police-regime
idea. But there is not a shadow of police-regime practice in
advocating Russian for small nations. Donât you understand the
difference between the truncheon and the advocacy of a free man? Amazing!


âI exaggerate the danger of Great-Russian nationalismâ!!! Now thatâs
really funny! Do the 160Â millions in Russia suffer from Armenian
or Polish nationalism? Is it not a shame for a Russian
Marxist to adopt the point of view of an Armenian hen-coop? Is it
Great-Russian nationalism that oppresses and shapes the policy of
Russiaâs ruling classes, or is it Armenian, Polish?? âArmenianâ blindness
makes you a Handlanger of the Purishkeviches and their
nationalism!  


To change the subject. Collect immediately and send me exact
information:
1) on the time and frequency of publication in the Caucasus of
Social-Democratic newspapers in Georgian, Armenian and other languages
(from such-and-such a date to...). So many issues. Liquidatorsâ
and ours.
2) Circulation of each of them.
3) The number of workersâ groups which have made donations.
4) Other information. Hurry. It is facts that Vienna needs, not
phrases. Answer immediately.  

Yours,
 V.Â I.

Dear
     Friend,[1]


Re a joint or different delegations with the liquidators, I would
advise you not to decide that now, i.Â e., not to mention it. âThe
delegates will decide
themselvesâ[4]



   (and we, of course, will make it two different ones: according to the Rules
   of the International, we should first try a joint one, and if no
   agreement is reached, then the issue is decided by the distribution of
   votes in the Bureau).

    


Re Kollontaiâs report, I agree with you: let her remain, but not from
Russia. In the debates you will take the floor first or second.  


Best wishes,

 Yours
       truly,[2]
 V.Â I. 

I was expecting a reply from you today. Nothing yet. Letters take
longer than to Brussels!  

We received the parcel. Many thanks. Iâve got your despatch. Many,
many thanks! Mr.Â chairman is not yet here!! And I do not yet know, if my
proposition (to send you) will be voted (if not, Gregory will go
himself). More
   thanks!![3]

Dear Friend, 

I have just settled with Grigory that he is not going (Zina is still
ill!)  (I am not going either)âand that you and Popov
  Â  

(and probably+Kamsky+Safarov only as secretary) have been
endorsed by the Central Committee.  

Tomorrow I shall send you the beginning and the end of the report. I am
also preparing for you heaps of advice: I am sure you will wipe the floor
with both Plekhanov (he is going!!) and Kautsky (going too). We shall teach
them a good lesson.... Splendid!  

Yours,
 V.U.

Dear
     Friend,[1]


I have just sent a letter off to Papasha (Mr.Â Harrison. 35. Mornington
Crescent. 35. London. N.Â W.)âhe is a member of the I.S.B.âasking him to
send Popov (Popoff, rue du Beff roi. 2. A.Â Bruxelles) a mandate for
5Â persons.  


{{

 Petrova (=Inessa; it is not advisable to let the liquidators know
the name!)

 Popov

 Vladimirsky

 Yuriev

    Volodin[2]

(Safarov).

 The latter two will probably not go.  

Forgive me please this disjointed letter. We have many guests and I
am extremely nervous, almost
     ill.[3]


I am sending the C.C. report by registered post. Please translate it,
i.Â e., start translating it at once (making it as polite as
possible and toning down the too sharply worded passages and
name-calling)âand send the Russian text to Popov as the
translation progresses.  
 

(I have left myself my rough copy in order to send
amendments and addenda and so that I could take a counsel of
Mr.Â Chairman who is not yet here but must come
      soon.[4]

)



I advise you to translate for your speech, and not for the press or for
the Bureau (Popov will afterwards make a fair copy from your rough one and
submit it to the Bureau)âtry to make it sound as if you were making a
speech and referring to your notes. (Take the Russian text with you, but
donât give it to the liquidators; say you didnât bring it along, and
that you only have the translation.)  

Start translating from Section IV (âConditionsâ). This is most
important of all, and it should be sent as soon as possible to Popov (who
is to study it and prepare himself, and talk it over with Berzin).  

N.B.

[[

In making the rough copy of the report in French leave room for amendments
and addenda.  

Better be in Brussels on the 15th. But if you canât, then let it be
16th. Get in touch with Popov.  

N.B.

[[

The figures in pencil stand for the pages of my rough copy here in case of
amendments and addenda.  

Please keep me informed more often (if only by the briefest of
letters) of the progress of your preparations, of any points that need
clearing up, etc.  

Yours very
     truly,[5]
 V.I. 

P.S. I advise you to ask for the floor to make your report first, on
the plea, if necessary, that your children are ill and you may have to go
home at once in the event of a telegram arriving.  

I am writing to Kamsky asking him to collect all the material.

  Â  

I shall send the packages to you and Popov from here tomorrow and
the day after.  

Read the other side, it will come in usefulâI wrote to Popov by
mistake on the back of my letter to
you!![6]

Take good care of all the documents which you will receive from Paris,
St.Â Petersburg and elsewhere for your work at the conference, and
then return them to me with care.  

If St.Â Petersburg sends you Stoikaya
Mysl[1] No.Â 18 and bourgeois newspapers for 4.IV and 5.IV. 1914,
these should be added as material to the C.C. report (on the
question of the liquidatorsâ attitude to the demonstration of
4.1V[2]). The report is being sent to Inessa.  

Your and Vladimirskyâs chief duty (Inessa is the French speaker) is to
write down as accurately as possible every thing that goes on, especially
the speeches of the Germans, and especially of Kautskyâand send
in a report on this to the C.C.  

Demand a translation of everything into French and do not accept the
German language (in this sense).  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Stoikaya Mysl (Staunch Thought)âone of the names under which
the Left-Narodnik (Socialist-Revolutionary) newspaper Trudovoi
Golos (Voice of Labour) was published. It appeared in St.Â Petersburg
in 1914 three times a week.





[2]
On the appeal of the St.Â Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. a
demonstration was held in the city on AprilÂ 4 (17), 1914, in response to
the lockout by the St.Â Petersburg mill owners. The demonstration was timed
to coincide with the second anniversary of the Lena shootings. On that day
Put Pravdy published as an editorial Leninâs article âForms of
the Working-Class Movement (The Lockout and Marxist Tactics)â (see present
edition, Vol.Â 20, pp. 209â12). In the Report of the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. to the Brussels Conference Lenin devoted a good deal of space to
describing the significance of this demonstration and exposing the
activities of the liquidators (ibid., pp. 509â12).

Dear Colleague, 

I thank you very much for sending me the last part of the book
Marxism and Liquidationism I have another very important request
to make of you. Will you please send immediately all the printed sheets of
this book (i.e., the whole book) to the following address: rue du
Beffroi. 2. A. Bruxelles. Mr. Jean Popoff. This is an extremely
important matter which does not brook a momentâs delay. Please send it
express, hire a messenger and mail it specially from the Warsaw Station. I
shall pay all the expenses promptly by special remittance if need be.  

If at all possible, I would ask you (on a matter of such great
importance as occurs only once in two years) to collect supplementary
material (sets of Pravda and Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta[1] for 2Â weeks, Nasha Zarya and the gems
of liquidationist literatureâconsult the editor of Trudovaya
Pravda[2]).  In the same package. I trust you will meet my
request. The articles of Bulkin and Martov in No.Â 3 of Nasha
Zarya, Axelrodâs articles on party reformâthat is to say,
revolution, Stoikaya Mysl No.Â 18, St.Â Petersburg bourgeois
newspapers for the evening of 4.1V.1914 and morning of
5.IV.1914, articles on the bloc between the Narodniks and liquidators in
the insurance campaign. What ever you can manage, to catch the
mail train (evening train, I believe) of the Warsaw Line.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta (Northern Workersâ Gazette)âa
Menshevik-liquidator daily, published in St.Â Petersburg in lieu of
Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta from JanuaryÂ 30 (FebruaryÂ 12) to MayÂ 1
(14), 1914.





[2]
Trudovaya Pravda (Labour Truth)âone of the names under which
the Bolshevik newspaper Pravda, bounded by the tsarist government,
was published from MayÂ 23 (JuneÂ 5) to JulyÂ 8 (21), Thirty-five numbers were
put out.

Dear Friend, 

I am extremely grateful to you. for giving your agreement. I am
positive you will carry off your important role with flying colours and
give a fitting answer to Plekhanov, Rosa Luxemburg and Kautsky and
Rubanovich (the insolent fellow!)  who are going to Brussels in the hope of
staging a demonstration against us generally and against my self in
particular.  

You are sufficiently familiar with the business, you speak well, and I
am sure you will now have enough âcheekâ. Please donât take my desire to
give you occasional advice in âa bad senseâ. It is meant to make your
difficult task easier. Plekhanov likes to âdisconcertâ comrades of the
âfemale sexâ with âsuddenâ gallantries (in French, and so on). You must
be prepared to meet this with quick reparteesâI am delighted, Comrade
Plekhanov, you are quite an old spark (or a gallant cavalier)âor
something like that to politely take him down a peg. You should
know that everybody will be very angry (Iâm very glad!) at my not

  Â  

being present, and will probably want to take it out on you. But I am sure
you will show them your ânailsâ in the best possible way. I am tickled in
advance at the thought of the cold, calm and somewhat scornful snub they
will be publicly inviting.  

Plekhanov likes to heckle and bully his victim. My advice isâcut him
short immediately, saying: you have a right, as has every member of this
conference, to ask questions, but I am not answering you personally, I am
answering the whole conference, so will you please not interrupt meâand
by this means promptly turn his heckling into an attack upon
him. You should be on the offensive all the time. Or, say: I shall take
the floor when my turn comes, in lieu of an answer and for an answer
(I prefer it that way), and you will be quite satisfied. In my
experience this is the best way to deal with insolent fellows. They are
cowards and will sing small at once.  

They donât like it when we quote resolutions. But that is the best
answer: I have come here chiefly to convey the officially
documented decisions of our workersâ party. For those who are
interested in these decisions I shall tell about one of them.  

Especially nota bene and look through beforehand: 

1) The resolution of the 1912 January Conference on the constitution of
the
     Conference.[1]

This is on the question of the validity of the January Conference
of 1912 (Rosa Luxemburg will probably raise the question of validity and so
will others). (By the way, I am glad thatÂ ... the Germans will hardly
understand you, if they understand at allâsit closer to the Executive
Committee and speak for them. At the same time you yourself have a
full right to ask Huysmans after every German speechâthe
translation, please!)  

2) The resolutions of 1912 and 1913 on flexible

forms[2]

(for Kautsky: this fool cannot grasp the difference between recognition of
the underground and the search for new forms of
screening this underground and organising it).  
 

3) The resolutions of II.1913 on unity from
      below[3]

(âYou exclude 670 groups of workers??â Nonsense! We invite
them. âThe majority has no right to exclude the minority.â Except in
cases when the minority flouts the will of the majority and does not bow to
formal decisions. This is our case).  

Yours,
 V.U. 

I advise you not to forget the official definition of the aim
of the conference (take the French text of the resolution of the I.S.B. of
XII.1913 from Popov or Huysmans), which is: 

To exchange opinions

  
     on moot points!!
   

Just that! To exchange opinionsâthat is what you are
doing.  

Another important subject for popular elucidation (you have to
be extremely popular with the French) is that of the illegal organisation,
of the complete trust, secrecy, etc., which it calls for. It is
all very well for you Europeans: you have an open, legal party, you have
lists of party members, you have open control and verification!!
Everythingâs easy then!!  

With us, however, an accurate and open recording of party membership in
the illegal organisation is impossible, as is also open
control. Therefore, the maximum trust is needed in order to maintain
discipline and good teamwork, whereas the liquidators, in rejecting the
idea of an under ground, are destroying the very possibility of joint work.


The opinion that it is impossible today in Russia to determine the
strength of the trends, to say whose lead the majority
follows, is erroneous, however.  

Thanks to the newspaper, to the contributions from the workersâ
groups, etc., this can be determined quite reliably and
unmistakably.  

(I sent Popov a number of statistical tables and
documents to have the headings translated and submitted to the Bureau.)

 

In Grigoryâs opinion we should not walk out because of a refusal to
take minutes and publish them; but a writ ten statement should be
submitted. The Executive Committee is an intermediary. This
should be kept firmly in mind (this is stated in the official resolution of
the Inter national Socialist Bureau of XII. 1913). Not an arbiter but an
intermediary. In case of anything, this is what you should
declare: we thank you for your mediation, we accepted it willingly, and
quote the resolution of the I.S.B. (of XII.1913). The word is
âmediationâ, but we ask of the mediator that he pass on to the opponent:
1) our conditions, and 2) objective information. And that
is all!!  

N.B. We are an autonomous party. Keep this firmly in
mind. No one has a right to impose anybodyâs will upon us, and the
International Socialist Bureau has no right either. If there are
threats, this is a mere phrase.  

Tomorrow I shall send the end of the report. You will have your work
cut out for you now, a lot of work to do and little time to do it in!
Thanking you in advance.  

Sincerely yours,

 V.Â I.

Dear Friend, 

We are now sitting here in special session with the new chairman &
other working
men.[7] The situation is excellent. I am extremely glad and thankful
for you that you have freed me (relieved
       me[1]

)

from the duty to be in Brussels (Martov is in Brussels. Your task is very
heavy but

  Â  

very important). Thank you many many times for your work so unpleasant
& so important.  

Our congress will have place (aura lieu) in August. Al most all
necessary money is already in our hands.  

Please talk over with

     Berzin.[2]

What is his opinion & his plan?  Who of them can attend? Their
C.C.? Or not? Or even their delegates from the local
     areas?[3]

Our congress will be good. Have a frank talk with him, and we shall
discuss the rest by
    letter.[4]


Wire us the results, etc., Saturday night for certain and in
fullest detail. On Sunday our telegraph office is open only from 8 to 10 in
the
   morning.[5]


Our chairman is here till Sunday. He must know the results.  

If you are asked at the conference whether we (that is, our C.C.)
will invite the national organisations to the congress, answer:
    Yes.[6]


Yours very truly,

 W.Â I.

Between JulyÂ 12 and 19 (N.S.), 1914, a meeting of the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. was held at Poronin under the leadership of Lenin,

 Â  

which was attended by G.Â I. Petrovsky, A.Â S. Kiselyov, N.Â P. Glebov-Avilov
and A.Â N. Nikiforova, who had arrived from Russia. The meeting was devoted
chiefly to the question of preparations for a Party congressâthe date of
its convocation, ways of getting delegates out of the country, etc. The
outbreak of the imperialist war, however, prevented the congress from being
convened.

Dear Friend, 

You no doubt know how the Brussels conference ended? The Polish
opposition went over to the liquidators!  

We are now in for a period of betrayals, but it will not alter
anything.  

Obviously, we shall not mess about with a âjoint congressââthe
liquidators+Rosa+the Alexinskys+the

Plekhanovs.[1] 

How is Samoilovâs health? Is he really on the mend? Will he be well for
Vienna? (By the way, are you preparing

  Â  

for Vienna? Answer me at length.) Write me about Samoilov in greatest
possible detail.  

How did they find his stomach?  

Regards to the family,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

Will you please take it upon yourself to keep us in formed during
the revolutionary days in
Russia.[1] 

We have no newspapers.  

Will you please 

1) send us daily (by ordinary book-post) Berlin news papers
giving the fullest news from Russia (VorwÃ¤rts, better
still, say, Berliner
Tageblatt[2]; choose which has most reports from Russia); 

2) ditto Russian newspapers from St.Â Petersburg and Moscow (we
have only Kievskaya Mysl)âRech, Novoye Vremya
(since the beginning of the July days)...  

3) telegrams concerning special, exceptionally important
events, if any, such as revolts among the troops, etc.  

My address for everything (including telegrams)âUlianow
(only two words). Poronin.

Huysmans and Vandervelde have unleashed all threats. Wretched
diplomats! They thought they could frighten us (or you). Of course, they
have failed.  

Grigory and I agreed it would have been wiser not to go at all. But the
Russian workers would not have under stood this; now they have a living
example to teach them.  

You handled the thing better than I could have done. Language apart, I
would probably have gone up in the air. I would not have been able
to stand the hypocrisy and would have called them scoundrels. And
thatâs what they were waiting forâthatâs what they were trying to
provoke.  

But you and the others carried it off calmly and firmly. Extremely
thankful & greeting
      you.[1]


I am surprised that today (Sunday) I have no wire concerning the
closing of the conference. It must have closed at 4Â oâclock on
Saturday. Did you (the three delegatesâyou, the Letts+the Polish
opposition) submit a written statement?  

Awaiting your impressions,

 Yours,

 V.U.

Sunday. 19/VII.  

My dear & dearest friend, 

Today at first Iâve got a report (very very good!)âevidently written
by Kamski. I greet you thousand times!! Your task was heavy
&Â .... Huysmans had done all against you & our delegation, but you
have dejonÃ© ses his
     sallies[1]

in the best manner. You have rendered a very great service to our party! I
am especially thankful because you have replaced me. The telegram
(yesterday)
says âyou
(we)
and the Lettsâ participated in the voting of an omnibus
resolution on tactics and organisation
(there are no more tactical differences, etc.).
Iâm sure this is a slip of the pen. You and the Letts did not
participate
(in the programme either).  

The liquidatorsâ last card is the help of the foreign
organisations, but that card, too, will be
    beaten.[2]


Iâve sent your son 150 frs. Probably it is too small sum? Pray, let me
know at once how much more you have spent. I shall send it
 immediately.[3]


Our congress must take place here about 20-25 August new style. You
must be delegate

   1) of the C.O.A.

   2) of the Brussels delegation.  

It would be better if you came earlier. Thereâs tons of work. Letâs
settle this in advance by
   letter.[4]


Yours,
 V.U.  

P.S. And Vandervelde and Kautsky in the role of gossips spreading
the tale that Lenin is âhiding in Brusselsâ!! How do you like that! Oh,
those vile scandalmongersâthey know only one method of struggle.


You and Popov told Huysmans off properly. Serves him
  Â  

right. Writeâare you very tired, very angry? Are you wild with me for
persuading you to
       go?[5]

Dear Friend, 

Today Iâve got your letter & a letter from Popoff. Your divergence
I cannot understand precisely & think it is not important. Important
was only the vote & you were right not participating in
it. Thatâs all.  

Why it is âextremely unpleasantâ for you to write about you being
delegated from the delegationâI do not under stand. Your quarrel with
Popoff is a bagatelle. Why are you against being delegated??? Write
frankly, please!!  

Thank you for details about conference! The comrade from the Lettish
party is here. We shall speak with him precisely about their participation
in our congress.  

Itâd be very good if you commence an exchanging of letters with Kautsky
(he is a mean creature, totally without character, under private
influences, always changing position according secret influence and angry
against me be cause of âmoney storyâ: it is especially mean to act as
âimpartialâ or to play the role of âimpartialâ, being partial &
angry especially against me personally because of private quarrel
with me because of money.
   Mean![1]

).

If he begged you to write him & if you can undertake the work of
translating in French all report and to sending him it (especially
about 4.IV.1914) it would be very good. But, naturally, it is a very
hard work & what concerns me I do not ask you to make it. If you
likeâfaites! (My personal opinion: it is good to inform Kautsky &
especially develop in very great
    detail[2]

the question of 4.IV.1914 &

  Â  

the statistics of groups: this statistics is partly published in the
Leipziger Volkszeitung v.Â 21.VII.1914. If you like, I send you it
& if you like I shall help you privately to prepare a letter for
Kautsky. But the play of mean intrigues is hard to paralyse now &
Kautsky is a victim of intrigues of RosaÂ L., Plekh. & Co. Plekh. is a
mean turncoat, as always. Did you see my blows at him in
Rabochy[4] No.Â 7 and in Prosveshcheniye No.Â 6?).  

The address of Neue Zeit I cannot find now. If you like you
can write an den Verlag der âNenen Zeitâ, Stuttgart,
Furtbachstra&Bwhatthee. 12 fÃ¼r Genossen Karl Kautsky.  

The idiots and intrigants with the aid of Kautsky will get a resolution
against us at the Vienna congress. Soit!! We cannot hinder it. But
we remain quiet. This last âatoutâ of the opportunists will be beaten
also.  

Your behaviour at the conference was right and was great service to the
party. Popoff writes me you were ill, your voice was feeble. What is this
illness? Please write me more details!! I cannot be quiet otherwise.  

Many kind regards & best wishes: be healthy and
quiet.[3]


Yours truly,

 W.Â I.

Poronin, JulyÂ 25, 1914 (Galizien) 

Dear Comrade, 

Please excuse me for taking the liberty of asking a favour of you
without knowing you personally. The latest revolutionary events in Russia
compel me to it.  
 

I found your address and the address of K.W. Jansson in
VorwÃ¤rts (Berlin), 1913, No.Â 33 (8.II.1913) (âAus der Parteiâ:
âDie in Stockholm lebenden deutschen Parteigenossenâ). Our contact with
St.Â Petersburg the usual way (via Warsaw) has now become impossible.  

I would therefore ask you to supply us with several good secret
addresses or one good secret address in Stockholm. The address should be
that of a reliable and very punctual comrade. It would be
desirable to receive a permanent ad dress. We can communicate in
German, French or English.  

This comrade would have to affix Swedish stamps to letters received
from us and send them to Finland (or to St.Â Petersburg). Also to send
letters (in their envelopes) received from Finland (or Russia) to
our address: Ulianow. Poronin (Galizien). If telegrams are
receivedâto wire them to us.  

If you will be so kind as to arrange this, I shall send you immediately
the necessary sum of money for postal and telegraph expenses (as well as
envelopes, etc.).  

I enclose an international reply coupon.  

As to my identity, I would inform you that from 1907 to 1911 I
represented the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party on the International
Socialist Bureau. My Party pseudonym is Lenin, my real name Ulyanov. My
former address, given in many published documents of the International
Socialist Bureau, is: Oulianoff. 4. Rue Marie Rose. Paris. (XIV).  

Since taking up residence in the country in Galicia I resigned this
post. Our representative on the International Socialist Bureau now is
Comrade Harrison (35. Mornington Crescent. London. N.Â W.).  

Comrade Branting, leader of the Swedish party, knows me. You can
telephone him. In the event of his not being in Stockholm, I am enclosing,
in proof of my identity, some wrappers of socialist newspapers which I am
receiving.  

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party,

 With Party greetings, thanking you in advance,

 N.Â Lenin
 (Vl.Â Ulyanov) 
 

P.S. Will you please send the enclosed letter to Finland.  

Wl.Â Uljanow. 

Poronin (Galizien).

Dear Comrade Rudis, 

I recently met a highly respected and valuable Lettish
   Social-Democrat,[1]

who told me about the âLeft oppositionâ in the Lettish party. He said you
belonged to it.  

I do not know to what extent the opposition which you and your friends
are raising to the Lettish C.C. is a really âLeft oppositionâ. I am sure,
at any rate, that if you are doing so, you are acting in good faith.  

In any case, the leftward shift on the part of the Lettish C.C. is an
obvious fact. Proof of this is provided by the resolution in No.Â 32 of
Trudovaya Pravda and the refusal to vote in Brussels for the
tainted, absurd resolution covering up the liquidators. The Polish
opposition voted for; in my opinion this is either treachery or a
dirty âgameâ or diplomacy of the worst kind.  

The 4thÂ District in Riga is said to stand for closer relations with our
C.C.?  

Is that true?  

Are the majority of Lettish workers for it or not?  

I think it would be important to acquaint the Lettish workers with our
â14Â conditionsâ. I sent them to Herman. I donât think he would refuse to
let you have them for a short time to read.  
 

Further, it would be important to make clear our attitude in principle
towards federation. We are against it in principle. We
are for democratic centralism. In that case, why preserve the old rotten
âagreementâ of 1906 with the Lettish Social-Democrats, which retains the
federative clauses, such as that providing for a
delegation from the Lettish C.C. to the general C.C.?? Even the Poles
in Stockholm (1906) rejected this federalist clause in principle.


I do not believe that the class-conscious Lettish workers stand for
this clauseâit facilitates manoeuvring, diplomacy, clannishness. It is
harmful to the work.  

Further. Is it true that there is vacillation among the class-conscious
Lettish workers on the question of the need for combating the separatism of
the Bund and cultural-national autonomy?? It would be very deplorable!


Has the resolution of our summer (1913) meeting on the national
question been translated into Lettish and
published?[3] 

The Polish opposition in Brussels adopted the liquidatorsâ stand and
âTyszkaâsâ play at diplomacy: a backheel for the Pravdists, a blow at
them from behind, and separation from them âin the face of Europeâ. They
now want, in the Tyszka way, to uphold the federalist clauses in agreements
and âcover upâ the nationalism of the Bund (cultural-national autonomy),
defend the rotten (for the liquidators useful) âlawfulnessâ of the Party
up to 1912 (i.e., prior to the Partyâs re-establishment against
the liquidators).  

I hope the Letts will not follow this path. I would like to know your
opinion and that of your Riga friends, of the 4thÂ District and others.


All the best. My regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Replying to Leninâs questions, I.Â Rudis-Gipslis wrote on JulyÂ 29, 1914,
that the Letts did have a âLeft oppositionâ to the Lettish C.C.; that he,
Gipslis, belonged to it; that in criticising the C.C. the opposition was
acting in good faith, and that the Lettish C.C. was shifting to the
left. Gipslis wrote that not only Rigaâs largest 4thÂ District but all
class-conscious Lettish workers considered it necessary to establish closer
contacts with the Russian C.C., that the Bund had a very negligible
influence among the Lettish workers, the majority of whom âwill always
support the vigorous and implacable struggle of the Russian comrades
against the separatists, nationalists and opportunists, no matter who they
areâ. Gipslis wrote that he had received the â14Â conditionsâ formulated
by Lenin for the Brussels âUnityâ Conference.

Dear Comrade, 

I am not getting VorwÃ¤rts, yet (judging from extracts in
Some socialist newspapers) there are important things in it nowâfor
instance, comments (and correspondence) on the St.Â Petersburg workersâ
movement, on the street demonstrations, etc.  

We need it badly (both for the C.O. and for other work).  

Could you make up and send us a set of cuttings from
VorwÃ¤rts on these questions (indicating the date of the
newspaper) and do that regularly?  

If you can I shall send you the money to cover expenses (let me know
how much).  

If you are busy or cannot do it generally, let me know.  

I trust you follow VorwÃ¤rts? Was there a translation in it
of Plekhanovâs article from
ZaÂ Partiyu?[1] 

I will be greatly obliged if you could collect also cuttings from
bourgeois newspapers concerning the present stormy events in
St.Â Petersburg.  

Hurry! 

Awaiting your reply

 Yours,

 Lenin

The local police suspect me of espionage. I lived in Cracow for two
years, in Zwiezsynice and 51 Ul. Lubomirskiego. I personally gave
information about myself to the commissary of police in Zwiezsynice. I am
an emigrant, a Social-Democrat.

  Â  

Please wire Poronin and mayor of Nowy Targ to avoid misunderstanding.  

Ulyanov 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Leninâs telegram to the Cracow chief of police followed a search of his
house in the village of Poronin on AugustÂ 7, 1914, made

 Â  

on the basis of false information accusing him of being a spy. During the
search the gendarme officer took away the manuscript of Leninâs book on the
agrarian question in the belief that the statistical tables given in it
represented a coded message, and ordered Lenin to present himself to the
military authorities in the town of Nowy Targ the next morning. On arriving
there the next day Lenin was arrested and imprisoned. His arrest evoked
active protests on the part of progressive elements among the Polish
public. The Polish Social-Democrats Jakub Hanecki and S.Â Bagocki, the
Zakopane doctor and one-time member of Narodnaya Volya Dluski, the
well-known Polish writers Jan Kasprowicz, Wladyslaw Orkan and others came
out in his defence. At the request of Nadezhda Krupskaya, Austrian M.P.s
Victor Adler and Herman Diamand, who knew Lenin as a member of the
International Socialist Bureau, interceded with the government on his
behalf and offered to act as guarantor for him. The charge of espionage was
so absurd that the Cracow police admitted that âthere is nothing
reprehensible here against Ulyanovâ and on AugustÂ 19 he was released.

Berne, le 15 sept. 1914 

Dear Sir, 

I wish to notify you of my change of address. Just re leased from short
captivity in Austria, I shall now live in Berne. Please acknowledge receipt
of this letter and let me know by what date I have to send in the article
(the war, I hope, is a sufficiently good reason for a
    postponement).[1]

If urgentâby wire, where one word (day of the month, old style) will
stand 4or the deadline. I am not quite sure yet whether the manuscripts
reach you in good time.  

At your service,

 V.Â Ilyin

Dear Friend, 

Hugeous regards from all of us to Abram. Let him visit
friends in Lausanne. He will find interesting documents
      there[1]

and I will address a demand to you to translate these documents in French
& send to Sentinelle (and to me send also with an
occasion).[5] (What party? Where published? Is it a decent organ?
Please send me one copy of the most characteristic issues of this paper.)


I am extremely anxious & angry with the position of the European
socialists in the present War. My conviction is that allâ& the German
socialists first of all & chief of allâgot âchauvinistsâ. It is
quite insupportable to read German and French
(lâHumanitÃ©!!) socialist papers!! Extreme âchauvinism"! I
am afraid that many, too many socialists, have lost their head (if I dare
say so) in the present crisis, and that in the last end it is the
opportunism which is responsible for this extreme âinfamieâ of the
European socialism. I am told Martynov (liquid.)  in Zurich has had a
conference (private, I suppose) and firstly at tacked German
socialistsâbut later on (the second day of discussion) a changÃ©
dâavis (sons lâinfluence funeste dâAxelrod) et a denie tout ce quâil avait
dit plus
      abord!!![2]

Shame!! We must in that or other manner tell our opinionâbut it is
extremely difficult, very difficult in such times.... Please let Abram go
to Lausanne and bring you news.  

Grigory has arrived with his family. We are remaining in
Berne. A dull little town, but... better than Galicia
and the best there is!! Never mind. We shall adjust
ourselves. I am poking around the librariesâI have missed
     them.[3]

Very very kind regards and hearty shakehands. Please write more about
yourself.  

Yours truly,

 W.Â I. 
 

I hope we shall soon meet? Do you think so?  


P.S. What is weather in Les Avants? Do you make walks?  

Do you feed better now? Have you books? papers?  

Arrangements should be made in Lausanne to collect all Swiss
newspapers in French containing socialist comments on the war, on the
German and French socialists, etc. Let Abram tackle
this. No effort should be spared in collecting
   documents!![4]

version of the Manifesto of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. âThe War and Russian
Social-Democracyâ.  

The answer to Vandervelde in connection with his telegram to the
R.S.D.L.P. Duma group was published in the newspaper
Sotsial-Demokrat No.Â 33, NovemberÂ 1, 1914.

Dear V.Â K., 

I am sending you the rest of the articles. All to be set in brevier.


Take the old format of the C.O.  

48 thousand letters desirable.  

Order:

1) statement of the
C.C.[1]

2) reply of Russian S.D.s


3) against the current

4) article on the
   International[2]

5) the International and defence of the fatherland


6) St.Â Ptsb. Letter from St.Â Ptsb.


7) R.Â V. Malinovsky.


Be sure to send the made-up issue before printing.  
 

On Monday I am lecturing at Montreux: shall I drop in? Or will
it be ready earlier?  

Send in your paragraph; it will hardly suit the character of
No.Â 1. Shouldnât it wait for No.Â 2?  

Yours,
Lenin

Dear V.Â K., 

Please forgive me for not having answered you so long:
I have been busy with the urgent article for Granat. I can gladden you with
pleasant newsâthe C.O. has been delivered to a point near the frontier
and apparently will soon be sent across. Congratulations! Again I thank you
heartily for all the trouble you are taking with the news paper! We are
planning to put out the next issue soon. The first is having a good
sale. (I am afraid your article on the Swiss elections is unsuitable in
character; I have given it to a colleague for discussion.) I shall
send you in a day or two No.Â 265 (for 13.XI.1914) de La
Sentinelle, published in La Chaux-de-Fonds. It carries a condensed
report of the Manifesto from the C.O. It would be a good thing to get it
published also in the Geneva paper!!  

Best regards from Nadezhda Konstantinovna and all our friends here.


Yours,
 V.U.

Dear V.Â K., 

I donât know how much thin paper you have (which does not cost us
anything, by the way). Print half on thin paper. Write and let us know
for how many issues you have thin paper. If there is plenty (we
shall probably get some more from Paris) and if it is not too bad for local
use, we shall increase the % of thin paper.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

We shall send the material tomorrow. All the same, the type
distribution will take time.  

Did you receive La Sentinelle? Will you have room?

25/XI.  

Dear Friend, 

Yesterday evening we read about the arrest of 11 people (including 5
members of the R.S.D.L. Duma
group)[1] near St.Â Petersburg and today we sent a telegram to Branting
for you to find out (le cas Ã©chÃ©ant through the Finns) whether the
5Â members of the Duma group have been arrested or not.  

Itâs a bad job if they have!  

All the more inadmissible is your departure for Denmark. Generally, I
strongly protest against such a removal. Now of all times you have to be in
Stockholm in order to organise contacts more properly, frequently and
widely. This is a difficult job that requires an experienced man, knowing
at least one foreign language. It simply cannot be shuffled off
onto âsomebodyâ.  

If you are molested (by the police) in Stockholm, you should hide
yourself in a village outside Stockholm (this is easy, they have
telephones everywhere). I think Kollontai,

  Â  

too, could easily come to Stockholm soon incognito or to some small place
outside town.  

We shall soon be putting out No.Â 34 of the C.O., then No.Â 35.  

Please answer quickly. We receive all your letters. The liquidatorsâ
document (their reply to
Vandervelde)[2] has also been received. Thanks.  

All the very best. Awaiting your news,

 Yours,

Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the arrest of the Bolsheviks who attended the conference
at Ozerki, near Petrograd, among whom were members of the R.S.D.L.P. group
in the Fourth Duma.  

The conference was held from NovemberÂ 2 to 4 (15â17), 1914, and was
attended, apart from the Bolshevik Duma deputies, by delegates from the
Bolshevik organisations of Petrograd, Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Kharkov and Riga.


All the delegates were arrested except the Bolshevik deputies, who
enjoyed parliamentary immunity. But they too were arrested a couple of days
later, tried and exiled for life to Eastern Siberia (see Leninâs article
âWhat Has Been Revealed by the Trial of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Duma Groupâ, present edition, Vol.Â 21, pp.Â 171â77).





[2]
The answer given by the St.Â Petersburg liquidators (P.Â P. Maslov,
A.Â N. Potresov, N.Â Cherevanin [F.Â A. Lipkin] and others) to Vanderveldeâs
telegram appealing to the Russian Social-Democrats

 Â  

not to oppose the war. In their reply the liquidators justified the
Belgian, French and British socialists in joining the bourgeois
governments, fully approved the stand adopted by the social-chauvinists and
declared that in their activities in Russia they were not opposing the
war. The liquidatorsâ reply was published in No.Â 34 of
Sotsial-Demokrat with a note from the editors.

Dear Comrade, 

I am sending you copy for the C.O.  

If you canât squeeze it all in, let the compositor say exactly
how much is left over. We shall throw something outâfirst and foremost we
shall hold up the item concerning Vandervelde (already sent to you).

Dear V.Â K., 

I am sending you more copy.  

We shall put out two issues one after the other. We have material in
super-abundance. The article concerning the

  Â  

arrest of the conference with the R.S.D.L. Duma group is ready and is a
must for No.Â 34, but we are holding it up as we have sent a telegram (we do
not know whether the 5Â deputies have been arrested or not).  

I take your word for it that there will be enough type for two
issues, so have everything set up, and we shall let you know in a day
or two the make-up of No.Â 34 and No.Â 35 (if you havenât enough type for
both issues, write and tell us immediately).  

Yours,
 Lenin 

Send us the proofs.

A reference to the resolution âA Reply of the Georgian
Social-Democrats, Members of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party,
Residing in Geneva and the Vicinity, to a National-Political Organisation
Operating in One of the Belligerent Statesâ. This organisation made a
proposal to the Georgian Bolsheviks to use the war for the purpose of
uniting the nations oppressed by tsarism and organising a revolt against
Russia under the auspices and with the material support of one of the
belligerent powers. In their reply the Georgian Bolsheviks rejected this
proposal, which they regarded as a provocation on the part of the
imperialists.  

The text of the resolution with Leninâs note was published in 1931 in
Lenin Miscellany XVII, pp.Â 321â22.

Dear V.Â K., 

I am sending you the text, received today (be sure to return
it), of the government report concerning the arrest.  

It must be inserted into the editorial (in lieu of what we
sent you) and the words about our not, knowing whether the deputies were
arrested or not, etc., should be thrown out.  

Drop a line, if only by postcard (that you have received this).  

When you can put out No.Â 34

    and No.Â 35.  

We must make great haste now: we have received extremely
interesting material concerning a âstatementâ of the Organising
Committee.[1] 

For the time being this is a secret.  

Delete the Georgian resolution.  

Regards,
 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

I received your letter with the news of your departure (on Sunday,
today is Friday) for Copenhagen.  

Write (1) whence your news and the rumours that you have
conveyed?  From what sources? Who brought them?  

(2) Do you now have your own sources? At least one address in
St.Â Petersburg? Or not? Is code and invisible ink being used with anybody
or with nobody at all just now?  
 

If there are no contacts, can you establish them?  

If not, letâs think how and through whom we can do it.
Further, did you get in touch with Litvinov in London?  

Beleninâs speech at the Swedish congress came off
wonderfully.[1] As for making a speech in Copenhagen (at the
January 1915
conference),[2] let us start discussing this by letter straightaway.


Yours,
 Lenin 

Uljanow. Distelweg. 11. Berne (Suisse).  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At the Congress of the Swedish Social-Democratic Party =

(see NoteÂ 354) the main item on the agenda dealt with the attitude towards
the war. A.Â G. Shlyapnikov, who brought the Congress a message of greetings
from the R.S.D.L.P.âs Central Committee, read a declaration calling for
struggle against the imperialist war and branding the treachery of the
leaders of the German Social-Democrats and the socialist parties of other
countries, who had turned social-chauvinist. The Congress was reported in
Sotsial-Demokrat No.Â 36, for JanuaryÂ 9, 1915.





[2]
This refers to the projected conference of socialists of the neutral
countries sponsored by Pieter Troelstra and Thorvald Stauning. The
conference was held in Copenhagen January 17â18, 1915, and was attended by
delegates from the socialist parties of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and
Holland. It adopted a resolution calling upon the Social-Democratic parties
of the neutral countries to urge their governments to mediate between the
belligerents for the speedy restoration of peace. Some of the
Social-Democratic parties submitted to the conference their declarations on
the attitude towards the war. From the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. the
conference was handed issue No.Â 33 of Sotsial-Demokrat containing
the Manifesto âThe War and Russian Social-Democracyâ and a

 Â  

government report concerning the arrest of the Bolshevik deputies of the
Duma.

Dear Comrade, 

I am enclosing a letter for Comrade âAlexanderâ.  

If he hasnât called on you yet, write him a letter through the city
post (address Fru Alexandra Kollontay.  Poste
restante. Kjobenhavn) saying you have a letter for Alexander and
asking him to call on you on such-and-such a day and hour.  

Why donât you write what news there is in the Scandinavian
labour movement? Who protested against the chauvinism of the
socialists and how?  

Write.
 Yours,

 Lenin

       1915

3/I.1915 

Dear Friend, 

I received your two letters with the news of your departure.  

The arguments you have advanced against my supposition (about the
possibility of your not going to Copenhagen, not leaving Stockholm) have
fully convinced me. I see that I have overlooked a really very important
circumstance. If I have offended you, I am prepared to tender my voluble
apologies and earnestly ask you to forget it.  

The
       village[1]

is really far more dangerous now (and in convenient for the work)
than the town.  

Generally speaking, the situation now is such that the fight against
tsarism calls for the utmost careâespecially as regards the preservation
of reserves. To expend still more forces (soon after our
immeasurable losses) would mean weakening ourselves completely for
the moment of more decisive actions against tsarism. Therefore I ask you
most earnestly to double and triple secrecy precautions and
1) either not go beyond asking for somebody to be sent to Sweden,
2) or confine yourself to the briefest of visits. I would ask you
earnestly to confine yourself to the former and not make the latter (if
there is the slightest possibility of not doing so).  
 

It would be better not to go to the conference (16/I) of the
Scandinavians. Grigory and I have just discussed this for the umpteenth
time. The Swiss are not going. That means there is an obvious intrigue of
the Germans and Troelstra+Branting. They will try their hardest to muddle
things up and will not allow you to make your Swedish
speech. Unless there is an absolute guarantee that you will be
allowed to make such a speech, you had better not go
altogether. We should send (through Litvinov)
Î±) a complete translation of our manifesto,
Î²) a translation of the governmentâs report concerning the arrest of
the R.S.D.L. group in the Dumaâand all this to be sent not as a rapport,
not as an account (so that it should not appear as if we recognise
the conference), but as a communication.  

Wishing you all the very, very best. The utmost care and sans
rancune, nâest-ce pas?  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

I am sending you the proofs.  

To speed things up, put out the
 No.[1]

without sending us proofs: the arrangement of the articles has already been
given you, hasnât it? If not, write at once.  

Will Kuzma manage the weekly C.O.?  

When does copy have to be sent for the next No. and how much of it has
been set up?  

P.S. Is there an information bureau in Geneva from
  Â  

which one can make inquiries concerning Russian prisoners of war in
Germany?  

Salut!

Dear Comrade, 

We received your article yesterday evening and have not had time yet to
read and discuss it.  

There is very little time left to write and send you a message by
hand. So please excuse me for being so brief. There is no news from
Russia. You will see what the state of affairs is from Nos.Â 35 and
 36.[1]


We do not have Sovremenny Mir.  

There is only 1Â copy of Nasha Zarya in Berne, sorry we canât
send it.  

As regards
Golos,[2] etc., it seems you are not fully in formed. Read the
whole of Golos.  

We are unable to send you a set. We shall try to get the Parisians to
do something about it, although it is not easy.  

We have not seen Parvus!  

Best regards from me, Nadezhda Konstantinovna and the whole Berne
crowd.

Dear Comrade, 

I am sending you the proofs.  

Terrible delay!  

Think over what to do. Kuzma must have been setting up for the
Bundists.  

What has to be done to put it out weekly?  

Did you receive all the copy for Nos.Â 36 and 37?  

I asked for a tentative arrangement of the material. If this
is inconvenient to you, we shall do that here, in which case send us a list
of all articles and items.  

Salut fraternel!

 Lenin 

We shall send a 4â5 line paragraph concerning the closing down of
Golos. Let us know the exact deadline.

I hope you will now have enough for both issues (Nos.Â 37 and 38).  

I asked some time ago whether you had enough copy for both issues. But
you are silent.  
 

And Kuzma is !!!  

Salut!
 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

I have just received No.Â 37 (please send me 2â3 copies from the
printing shop as soon as they come outâit is important for the
Editorial Board to have them as early as possible).  

Why didnât you make a correction in regard to the date of
No.Â 36?[1] 

Will you please drop me a line at once 


1) on how the setting-up of No.Â 38 is progressing
      

2) when it will be finished
      

3) â â can come out
      

4) â copy for No.Â 39 should be sent
      

5) does the material squeeze in or not?
      


The thing is that owing to the considerable delay with No.Â 37 quite a
lot has to be inserted.  

Send us a list of the available articles.  

Did you have a talk with the compositor? Have you fully
ascertained whether it is possible to put out a weekly issue?  

I await your reply with impatience.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

P.S. I enclose âMore About Social-Chauvinismâ for setting up.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to a correction of the date erroneously given in the
heading of No.Â 36 of Sotsial-Demokrat. No.Â 39 of the paper carried
an erratum reading: âThe heading of No.Â 36 should read âGeneva, JanuaryÂ 9,
1915â (and not DecemberÂ 12, 1914)â.

Werter Genosse, 

I have just written to Skaret (about Haidukiewich). But as you did not
give me Haidukiewichâs address, I wrote Skaret that Haidukiewich would
call on him, mentioning my postcard. So please write immediately
to Haidukiewich.  

I was down with influenza and have not quite recovered yet; that is why
I did not answer you myself. I hope you will forgive me.  

The London Conference turned out an utterly disgusting thing, as was to
be
expected.[1] Of course, we could do nothing to prevent it. Beste

Notes
 
 



[1]
The London Conference of Socialists of the âTriple Ententeâ
Countries was held on FebruaryÂ 14, 1915. The agenda of the Conference
consisted of three items: =

1) the right of nations; 2) colonies; 3) guarantees of future peace.  

The Bolsheviks were not invited to the Conference. On Leninâs
instructions, however, M.Â M. Litvinov went there to read the declaration of
the C.C., R.S.D.L.P., which was based on Leninâs draft. During the reading
of the declaration Litvinov was interrupted and not allowed to go on. He
handed the declaration over to the presiding committee and left the
hail. For further details about the Conference see Leninâs articles âThe
London Conferenceâ and âOn the London Conferenceâ (present edition,
Vol.Â 21, pp.Â 132â34, 178â80).

Dear Comrade, 

We are terribly worried at the absence of news and proofs from you. Has
the compositor taken to the bottle again? Or taken on outside work again??
It is devilishly important now to put the paper out without delay
(for there

  Â  

is highly important and urgent material concerning the London
      Conference[1]

).

For Godâs sake answer quickly. This is one thing.
2) Do your best to speed up the issue. Hurry with the proofs.
3) Call your group together and take all steps jointly to organise the
proper issue of the C.O. once for all. Really, these delays are
impossible: they kill all desire to work!!  

Salutations!
 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

I am sending the proofs and new copy. This issue must
carry a report on the London Conference.  

For Godâs sake do everything you can to speed it up. (If you
cannot put it out before our
meeting[2]), then be sure to bring the proofs along
with you (especially the articles on defence of the fatherland).  


[[BOX:
 N.B. The material on Martov is to be held

Notes
 

[1]
The article âMore on Martovâ was published in the newspaper
Sotsial-Demokrat No.Â 41 on MayÂ 1, 1915.âEd.  
 



[2]
This refers to the Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. Sections
Abroad, held in Berne from FebruaryÂ 27 to MarchÂ 4, 1915.  Convened
on Leninâs initiative, it was essentially a general conference of the
Party. The main item on the agenda was the question of the war and the
tasks of the Party, on which Lenin made a report.  

All the basic resolutions and preambles to them were drafted by
Lenin. They were published in the newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat and
as addenda to Leninâs pamphlet Socialism and War published in
Russian and German. The resolutions of the Berne Conference were also
published as a leaflet in French, which was distributed among the delegates
of the Zimmerwald Socialist Conference and sent to the Left elements among
the international Social-Democrats. For the Conference resolutions see
present edition, Vol.Â 21, pp.Â 158â64.

In my opinion Â§Â 3 is no
good.[2] I think it would be better instead to tell in a
popular manner how the C.O. can be helped by contributions
(emphasise that it has no assistance in the way of contributions) and
prepared for still more frequent issue.  

We must leave our hands untied in regard to the Baugy
group[1]

and leave ourselves a slight chance for reconciliation with them. In this
form it is harmless and left entirely to our discretion.  

âMore frequent issue (right down to a daily)ââisnât that
enough?  

We shall say the one and the other: daily issue or
even a parallel one.  

âParallelismâ is downright harmful: it means helping them to
win a sister away from us.

Berne, MarchÂ 12, 1915 

Dear Comrade, 

The enclosed letter is from Comrade Inessa whom we have authorised to
work on bringing the socialist women of the Left closer
together.[1] I earnestly request you to find a Dutch woman comrade who
shares your point of view and could be delegated to the conference of
socialist women from your party (if not in person, at least in writing).


My congratulations on Gorterâs pamphlet, which takes such a hard knock
at the opportunists and
Kautsky.[2] 

I shall be greatly obliged if you will answer me as quickly as
possible.  

With fraternal greetings,

 N.Â Lenin (Vl.Â Ulyanov) 

Wl.Â Uljanow. Distelweg. 11. Berne (Suisse).  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The letter was written by Inessa Armand on behalf of the foreign-based
section of the journal Rabotnitsa giving notice of the convocation
of a conference of Left socialist women and inviting the Dutch
Social-Democratic Party to send its delegate.  

The International Conference of Socialist Women was held in
Berne from MarchÂ 26 to 28, 1915. It was convened on the initiative of the
foreign-based organisation of the journal Rabotnitsa and with the
close co-operation of Clara Zetkin, then Chairman of the International
Bureau of Socialist Women. All the preparations for the Conference were
made by Inessa Armand, Nadezhda Krupskaya and others under Leninâs
guidance.  

Materials relating to the Conference were published in the Supplement
to Sotsial-Demokrat No.Â 42 for JuneÂ 1, 1915.





[2]
This refers to the pamphlet by H.Â Gorter, Het Imperialisme, de
Wereldoorlog en de Social-Democratie (Imperialism, the World War and
Social-Democracy), Amsterdam.

Really, itâs wrong of you not to take money for copying. For one thing,
it is downright uncomradely not to comply with the agreed

Secondly, you are compelling me now to doingâwhat?  

To not sending you anything more?  

Think this over in a calmer and less irate mood, and I am sure you will

  Â  

   
   To Comrade H.Â Gorter
   

Dear Comrade Gorter, 

Comrade Radek has shown me your letter.  

It would certainly be very good if an international Social-Democratic
journal could be founded under the editor ship of Pannekoek. We must fight
Neue Zeitâs mean way of defending opportunism of the worst brand
by means of sophisms.  

The only question isâwill we have enough money and literary forces to
establish the journal immediately?  

If not, we must without fail issue one (or two) pamphlets in German,
without waiting until the war is over. The pamphlet should consist of
articles by Russian, Dutch, German (Radek), French (perhaps Merrheim) and
English (perhaps Rothstein) comrades, who consider it necessary to wage a
ruthless fight against the opportunist traitors (including Kautsky).  

In my opinion, we should under no circumstances lose any time
in doing this. It is necessary, right now, while the war is still
on, to tell the whole truthânaturally, not in Germany, but in
Switzerland, so that we can speak freely about the revolutionary struggle,
without a censorship.  

If a French or English contributor cannot be found at once, we should
not wait; better issue the first pamphlet ourselves (i.e., without the
French and English). We can make do with a translation of Merrheimâs
opinion (namely, that to speak about a âwar of liberationâ is a
deception).  

Radek says that your pamphlet has come out in English. I am
very glad to hear itâI shall now be able to read and understand it. I
understand Dutch to the extent of approximately 30â40%. I congratulate you
on your splendid at tacks on opportunism and Kautsky. Trotskyâs principal
mistake is that he does not attack this gang.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 N.Â Lenin 
 

My address is: Wl.Â Uljanow. Waldheimstrasse 66. Bern. Write
me a postcard when you are coming.

Dear
     Friend,[1]


I have written to you once or twice, but truth to tell, there is little
news here. The news from Russia is not bad, you will read it all yourself
soon, I hope, when you come here. You donât mention a word about what
length of time your dentist has appointed for your treatment. Even
approximately? You should travel either by post-chaise (up to FlÃ¼hli
twice a day, at 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. from SchÃ¼pfheim, and to us, to
SÃ¶renberg, only once a day, at 9 a.m. from SchÃ¼pfheim). To
catch the morning post (that is, the post-chaise), I think you
must start out from Berne at 5.30 a.m. and wait 11/2
hours at SchÃ¼pfheim. But if you leave Berne at 2.05, as we did,
the post-chaise will take you only as far as FlÃ¼hli; from there you will
have to hire a horse-drawn vehicle (for that purpose you will have to
telephone from SchÃ¼pfheimâthere is a restaurant there opposite
the station. The keeper for 10 pfg. will telephone us here, Hotel
Marienthal in SÃ¶renberg, saying you are coming and asking for a
horse-drawn carriage to be sent:
in that case they will just manage to get to FlÃ¼hli from here and bring
you down here from FlÃ¼hli).  

The fare by post-chaise is fr. 1.20 to FlÃ¼hli+2 frs. from FlÃ¼hli to
SÃ¶renberg.  

Horse and carriage here costs 4Â frs. per person (6Â frs. for 2Â people)
from FlÃ¼hli to SÃ¶renberg.  
 

Your letter for some reason travelled to Lucerne! I wonder why? Is it
because you wrote SÃ¶renberg in one line? Or should you not add via
SchÃ¼pheim?  

All the best. See you soon,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. I wrote Grigory yesterday about inviting Grimm to
Kommunist. Today I read Trotskyâs answer (to Kommunist)
in Nashe
Slovo.[2] We must be extremely careful, in inviting
Grimm, not to risk a refusal. Tell Grigory this.  

Another request: when you see Kasparov, ask him to obtain the
official address of the Bureau (in Geneva? or in Berne?), which
undertakes to forward money to Russian prisoners of war in Germany
(letters as well as money, but chiefly money). It is very important to have
the official address, so that I can apply to them and be sure the money
will not get lost.  

Another request (tut-tut! Our tons of things and requests will crush
you completely, eh?): buy citric acid in crystals (ZitronensÃ¤ure). Itâs a
bad jobâgoing out into the country after everybody else!!  

There is still no reply from
NeuchÃ¢tel.[3] 


Would you believe it!  

Au revoir,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

When opportunity offers, ask Radek before your departure whether he
would like to come. If he does, we shall invite him.  

Bring 15â20 copies of the Announcement of
Kommunist.[4] 
 

Notes
 

[1]
These words are in English in the original.âEd.  
 



[2]
The Invitation to Trotsky to write for Kommunist was sent by
G.Â L. Pyatakov and Yevgenia Bosh in spite of Leninâs opinion.  By way of
answer Trotsky published âAn Open Letter to the Editors of
Kommunistâ in Nashe Slovo No.Â 105 for JuneÂ 4, 1915,
refusing to contribute and launching a fierce attack against the
Bolsheviks.  

The journal Kommunist was organised by Lenin and published by
the Editorial Board of the newspaper Sotsial-Demokrat jointly with
G.Â L. Pyatakov and Yevgenia Bosh, who financed its publication. The
Editorial Board included also N.Â I. Bukharin. One (double) number of the
journal was issued.  

Lenin planned to make Kommunist the mouthpiece of the Left
Social-Democrats. Serious disagreements, however, shortly arose between the
editors of Sotsial-Demokrat on the one band and Bukharin, Pyatakov
and Bosh on the other, which came to a head after the appearance of
No.Â 1â2 of the journal.  

Nashe Slovo (Our Word)âa Menshevik newspaper, published with
Trotskyâs close co-operation in Paris from January 1915 to September 1916
in lieu of Golos.





[3]
Lenin wrote to the library at Neuch&ahattel asking for books to be
sent to him in SÃ¶renberg.





[4]
This refers to the Announcement concerning publication of the journal
Kommunist written apparently with Leninâs close co-operation. It
was printed as a leaflet dated MayÂ 20, 1915, and distributed among the
R.S.D.L.P. organisations in Russia and abroad, as well as among Left
West-European Social-Democrats. The text of the Announcement under the
heading âFrom the Editorsâ was published also in the journal
Kommunist.

Dear Friend, 

I am sending Neue Zeit.  

I have read Izvestia. Lovely! Especially that about Nashe
Slovo.[1] The C.O. is essential now.  

Write me about the plan of distribution of subjects. I should like to
take that on âdefeatâ and on the alliance of Potresov+O.C.+Chkheidze
vs. Nashe Slovo.  

As regards âegoismâ you are guilty ofÂ ... a slight misstatement. You
sent me what you had. But I had nothing!!  I sent you all the
latest titles, but you havenât sent me a single one up till
now.  

I have received No.Â 2 of Nashe
Dyelo.[2] I shall send it to you when finished with.  

Whatâs this about Radekâs article? Isnât he cheating? We are
negotiating with Alexander. What about you?  

Everybody (and not only the ladies) will be extremely grateful for the
cherries. Why are you silent about coming out here to climb the Rothorn?


All the best. Salut!

 N.Â Lenin

This refers to the article âDemagogy and Cleavageâ published in No.Â 2

Abroad for JuneÂ 14, 1915.





[2]
Nashe Dyelo (Our Cause)âa monthly organ of the Menshevik
liquidators, began to appear in January 1915 in lieu of the journal
Nashe Zarya which was closed down in October 1914. Nasha
Dyelo was the mouth piece of the social-chauvinists in Russia.  

No.Â 2 of the journal figures largely in Leninâs article âUnder a False
Flagâ (see present edition, Vol.Â 24, pp. 435â57).

Dear Friend, 

I received the article and read it, and am forwarding it to Bukharin.


The passage about the votes within Kommunist should now, of
course, be thrown out of the item on Trotsky. But

  Â  

should everything about the Chkheidze Duma group be thrown out too? It is
the crux of the political situation, and will remain that for a
fairly long time to come!  

Many thanks for the cherries from everybody!  

I have nothing new in the way of literature, French or other; so
itâs no use your trying to wriggle out of it.  

âTitleâ: La Chesnais: âLe groupe socialiste du Reichstag et
la dÃ©claration de guerreâ (Paris. 1915 lâHumanitÃ©,
fr. 1.50). I shall ask Grisha to send it.  

I am sending you Radekâs letter: I am writing him that Grimm must
write to the
      C.C.[1]

We should not angle for an invitation. Kautsky & Co.âs volte-face is a
lousy trick to wean the workers away from revolution by
means of Left phrases. Thatâs clear.  

I wired Y.Â F. to come here and sent her a letter. No posts should be
given, but we should make peace, of course, and we have long been doing
that. The best thing would be for you to cycle down here. That can
easily be done via SchÃ¼pfheim (the descent to FlÃ¼hli is
20Â mm.!!). Send me your phone number (or that of a nearby telephone): I
would then phone you about the time of Y.Â F.âs arrival here. Our phone is
No.Â 111 (Hotel Marienthal).  

The best time to ring up is 8.30 a.m. If you do not send me
your phone No. I shall wire you (Kommt such-and-such a day): meaningâcome
to meet Y.Â F.  

Regards to everyone,

 Yours,

 N.Â L.

Dear Friend, 

I am greatly surprised that youâfor no apparent reasonâhave shirked
a meeting!  

There was no need to make peace, as the visitors were remarkably
peaceable (only one of them wanted Kamenev, expelled from the Party). We
came to an agreement splendidly (without
posts).[1] 

The translation of Radek is not very good (Part I is dull) (it
is needed, though, for the sake of solidity). I have for
warded it to
N.Â I.[2] 

Before I forget. The visitors have persuaded me that it is not
worth airing in the press our differences in the
Editorial Board of Kommunist (about you and me having voted
against Trotsky). They are right. Delete it!!  

As to Chkheidzeâs
group,[3] we must start a campaign against it. Therefore
(since the passage regarding the voting is to be deleted), I raise
again the question of inserting my small article âAn Instructive
Experienceâ (the talk with the visitors has shown once again that the
whole crux now is in the Chkheidze group).  

N.B. No one from us is writing an answer to Maslov!! Wonât Radek write
at least a
review?[4] 

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

Radek for some reason is silent!! I shall wait a bit longer.  

Did you receive No.Â 2 of Nashe Dyelo and Izvestia?


Shouldnât the chapter from Gorter about Kautsky & Co. be
translated? I think it should!  


[[DOUBLE-LEFT-BOTTOM-HALF-B0X-ENDS: 

I am sending Abramâs
article.[5] I am for it. The essential thing is
facts, not mere âtacticsâ. He has a useful collection of
facts. I have made corrections here and there. I advise signing it
A.Â B. for secrecy reasons (for the sake of the authorâs safety).]]


 

P.S. 

In the event of your coming I add: SchÃ¼pfheimâ720 metres,
FlÃ¼hliâ8 km from itâ893Â m and SÃ¶renberg within 10Â km of
FlÃ¼hliâ1,165Â m. It is a drive road. You can cycle
uphill one-third of the way from FlÃ¼hli to SÃ¶renberg (descent
to FlÃ¼hli =20 minutes by bicycle).  

P.S. How do your talks stand with Yuri about money for transportation?
Alexander is getting ready. Write how much can be received and
when.  

P.S. What about Karpinskyâs contributions? Heâs offended, I
believe.  

The preceding was written yesterday.  

I didnât manage to send it off yesterday. I have received
VorwÃ¤rts+Adler. Thanks very much.  

N.Â I. asks for Abramâs article.  

I am sending N.Â I.âs article and review (with
remarks).[6] 

I advise putting the review in Notes. Of course, if we
have to choose, I am for N.Â I., not for Abram.  

I am sending Radekâs letter. I think we ought to snatch at the plan of
a pamphlet with both
hands.[7] I am writing to Radek.  

I propose that we publish Attitude of Russian Social-Democracy to
the War: 1) Manifesto; 2) Resolution; 3) A specially written article
on slogans, etc.; 4) Ditto on the history of the split in the
R.S.D.L.P. and on the R.S.D.L. Group in the Duma ((the articles
from the C.O. are quite unsuitable)). Let us discuss the matter by
letter without delay and divide the subjects.  

Would Yuri give money for this pamphlet? Very
important.  

Regards to everybody,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

Have you got Voprosy Strakhovaniya Nos.Â 3 and 4? If not, we
shall send them.  

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This apparently refers to Yelena Rozmirovich, G.Â L. Pyatakov and
Yevgenia Bosh who visited Lenin in SÃ¶renberg in July 1945 for talks
concerning the Journal Kommunist.





[2]
Lenin is referring to Radekâs article âA Quarter of a Century of
Development of Imperialismâ (the first part of it was published in the
journal Kommunist No.Â 1â2).





[3]
The Chkheidze groupâthe Menshevik group in the Fourth Duma
led by N.Â S. Chkheidze. While taking a Centrist stand, it actually gave
full support to the policy of the Russian social-chauvinists. Lenin
criticised the opportunist line of the Chkheidze group in his articles
âThe Chkheidze Faction and Its Roleâ, âHave the Organising Committee and
the Chkheidze Group a Policy of Their Own?â  (see present edition,
Vol.Â 23, pp. 474â74, and Vol.Â 22, pp. 134â36) and in other works.





[4]
The reference is to P.Â Maslovâs book Economic Causes of the World
War which appeared in Moscow in 1915.  

A review of the book was written by N.Â I. Bukharin but not published
because the Journal had stopped coming out.





[5]
This refers to the article âQui prodest?â by N.Â V. Krylenko which was
to have been published in the journal Kommunist. The article did
not appear.





[6]
Apparently this refers to N.Â I. Bukharinâs article âWorld Economy and
Imperialismâ and his review of P.Â Maslovâs book Economic Causes of the
World War for the Journal Kommunist.





[7]
This refers to Radekâs letter to Lenin dated JulyÂ 5, 1945, suggesting
that a pamphlet be written giving the views of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. on the
attitude towards the war.

I strongly advise rewriting the end of your article (Lemberg)
, etc. (dropping here into pathos is badâit strikes a wrong
note).  



[[SQUIGGLY |]] 

Add answer to No.Â 2 (Izvestia) by points of reconciliation in the âO.C.â
between the French social-chauvinists and German social-chauvinists
(especially), Bund chauvinism (the crook Ionov) and the
Caucasian crooks (for âunityâ with An!!) (Note or P.S.).  

Nadya is extremely surprised that you do not return her the
needed (for the C.O.) letter and do not answer!??!  


I intend to demand that the answer to Trotsky concerning the Chkheidze
group be voted on the Editorial Board of
      Kommunist.[1]

Let them turn it down!

     (Then in Sotsial-Demokrat) 


Reverting to the trip: from SchÃ¼pfheim to Luzern there is also a
descentâyou can probably make it without pedalling!  

I am sending 3Â things for the C.O. Who is going to get in touch with
the printing shop? Write.

I am sending you the notebook: Inessa asks that it be returned
when
       copied.[1]

 

I am sending Wijnkoopâs letter. Return it immediately (if
useful, show it to Yuri). I shall snatch at this âlittle kernelâ
of a Left International with both hands. We must work as hard as we
can to get closer together with them. I am hurrying Radek to translate
the Berne
     resolutions.[2]


I am sending the beginning of the pamphlet (in the rough) so
that we can discuss how to continue the job and turn out a
âwholeâ piece by two authors (show it, if useful, to
Yuri; perhaps they will give some money for such a thing? If not,
itâs not worth while showing the rough
       copy).[3]


Send your comments on a separate sheet.  

Return immediately.  

I think that, when edited, it may turn out a popular and important

Ludmila is staying with us (she is going to Russia). News from Paris:
Trotsky & Co., soon after the international conference of the Leftists,
want to hold a conference of the Russians (i.e., apparently the
O.C.+C.C.+Nashe Slovo).  First, at the Leftist conference, to
adopt a âgeneral

  Â  

Leftâ resolution, then (having thereby proved the Leftism of Nashe
Slovo and the O.C., which is expected to vote for
anythingâMÃ¤dchen fÃ¼r alle) to offer us (âin front of
everybodyâ?) to join them in a general conference of Russians and to use
our refusal against us....  

Not a bad intrigue! Make a copy of Radekâs
draft[2] for yourself at once (return the draft to me
immediately!) and we shall carefully consider our tactics.  

Should we propose amendments to Radek right away? (+an
all-out struggle against the opportunists;+civil war; +a split
with the opportunists). Or should we propose our own draft, and after it
has been turned down, vote for Radekâs? Or both?  

A protest in writing to be lodged against the participation of
Nashe Slovo 
partiesâthey are not a partyâor âsections of a partyâ are
allowed. Let them say they are part of the O.C.Â 2) double representation:
Martov in both the O.C. and Nashe Slovo).  

Thisâwithout
fail./*// 
Or attend with 3Â delegates from the C.O.A. (apart from the 3
from the C.C.)  and demand a vote for them. Arenât they as good as
the Nashe Slovo group? The same applies to the womenâs
organisation.  
   \\*\\



The C.C. delegation should be got ready. All languages needed:
Inessa for French and English. And for German? If Kinkel has gone away,
perhaps we should take Kharitonov from Zurich? (Ludmila, apparently, would
like to go, but....) Expenses? Where will the conference be held? For how
long? Letâs think this over beforehand.  

All the documents concerning Chkheidze & Co. (against them) should
be carefully collected. Should the Leftists (Radek+Thalheimer+Wijnkoop+??)
ask for a private meeting to have a âtalkâ with Nashe
Slovo, it may not always be possible to refuse them. (The same applies
to all and every document. We shall settle this beforehand by letter.)


Ought we not to start preparing our own draft manifesto, as detailed as
Radekâs, but with a declaration of war against opportunism? Or should we
accept Radekâs as a basis?  

I have written to
      Kollontai[1]

and Blagoev. I am writing

  Â  

to Wijnkoop: if he doesnât do it, itâs his lookoutâI will have done my
duty.  

Write to Grimm he should notify you by wire if there is to be
another Vorkonferenz (they may engineer one, for otherwise who,
where, and when will determine the composition and so forth?). Perhaps we
should also write Grimm that he is obliged to notify (just in
case) the Norwegian and Swedish Leftists immediately? We should!! (Address:
c/o Fru
A.Â Kollontay. Turisthotel. Holmenkollen. Kristiania. Norwegen).


Regards,
 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. The conference is likely to be a âpackedâ meeting of Kautsky and
Renaudel for âmaking peaceâ?? In that case weâll kick up a row and walk
out, after lodging a protest.  

Send all my paragraphs (for Kommunist) to Yuri. Send me
Kamenski. I advise No.Â 1 (96Â pp.), August
1915.[3] No.Â 2 (September 1915)âalso 96Â pp.  Gorter in No.Â 2. I stood
up for Varin, made him nine-tenths safe: they have to be threatened, then
they backtrack. This is for No.Â 3.

Dear Friend, 

Did you receive Abramâs article (back) and the article for the C.O.?


I am sending some more short articles for Kommunist. (I donât
think we need worry about the size. Abramâs should be inserted too for
certain. We must have facts. We must have versatility. Better let
No.Â 1 be fuller. In case of any thing, a 5% pay rise and employment of a
second compositor.)  

I am sending copy for the C.O.  
 

Figure out the size (the C.O. will now be smaller, will it not?) and
get it done with.  

I donât think there will now be a conference of Leftists:
Kautsky & Co. will call a general conference.  

Radek is silent.  

I do not agree with the end of your article (about Nashe
Slovo).  âPeaceâ as presented by Nashe Slovo should be
attacked a hundred times more sharply. We should not make excuses (âthat
is not the pointâ, âwe admitâ) but attack: the Nashe Slovo
people are engaging in phrase-mongering about âpeaceâ, while seeking
peace with the social-chauvinists. The gist of their peace slogan is
peace with the social-chauvinists. It should be pointed out (and
elaborated) that peace without terms is nonsense, a mere
phrase. Then it should be elaborated that peace for the ignorant
mass has a different meaning (Ã Â la
âGaponadeâ[1]), but as a slogan of the Party it is charlatanry. We
are for participation in the Gapon unions, but against the
âGaponâ slogans. I advise discussing this further by letter.  

Yours,
 Lenin 

I am sending you Fridolinâs letter. I advise inviting him; let
me know whether you write to him, or want me to write. ((Return
all the letters of Radek, Fridolin, etc.))  

I am not sure that you communicated all your latest literary
âtitlesâ to me. Eh??  

I think we ought to obtain Alexinskyâs book La Russie et la
guerre.  

What do you think?  

I believe the âBibliography and Notesâ in Kommunist were
better unsigned (for the sake of variety and avoiding repetition of the
same names).  

Vote this proposal. Yuri, if he likes, may leave his signature
(âPyotr Kievskyâ): I suggest that his
article[2] be given in the same section.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

âGaponadeââfrom the name of the Russian priest
Gapon. Acting on instructions from the secret political police aimed at
weaning the workers away from the, revolutionary struggle, he set up, on
the eve of the first Russian revolution, a legal organisation known as the
Assembly of Russian Factory Workers. On Gaponâs suggestion, a peaceful
procession of workers was organised on JanuaryÂ 9, 1905, to petition the
tsar. The procession was shot down by the tsarist troops, the massacre
becoming known as Bloody Sunday.

This refers to Pyatakovâs review of No.Â 1 of the journal
Internationale published by Rosa Luxemburg and Franz Mehring.

SÃ¶renberg, 15/VII. 1915 

Dear Comrade, 

I am sending you the report on the Berne preliminary conference by our
representative Comrade Zinoviev. Will you please show it to Comrades
Pannekoek and Gorter and let us know as soon as possible your opinion and
that of your party (or resolution).  

I think this preliminary conference was very important and useful only
in the sense that it definitely showed up the âstrangeâ (to put
it mildly) role of certain German âLeftistsâ (Frau Clara Zetkin in
particular). A few months ago I asked one of the German âLeftistsâ in the
presence of Comrade Radek whether, if things came to a split, Clara Zetkin
would go with the old or with the new party (that is, the revolutionary,
and not the national-liberal party like that of today). âWith the old
one,â this âLeftistâ answered without hesitation.  

Comrade Radek got very angry with this Leftist and assured me that the
man was mistaken, and that Clara Zetkin would decidedly and sincerely fight
the mean German social-chauvinists.  

And now this argument has definitely been settled, but not in favour of
Radek. Zetkin wishes to go together with Haase-Kautsky, but
Haase-Kautsky desire âunityâ (with SÃ¼dekum: we call this in Russian
âunity of lackeys, a splitting of revolutionariesâ, that is, unity with
the national bourgeoisie, a splitting of the international working class)!!
I am convinced that this âLeftâ conference with Zetkin,
with Haase, without Lichtstrahlen and the
Tribune people, is sheer hypocrisy: the objective significance of
this conference consists merely in strengthening the old disreputable party
by means of a sham struggle of the âLeftâ (Ã Â la Zetkin)
against the âRightâ (the Whigs and Tories of present-day Britain!).  

We must (together with the Tribunists and some of the German
Leftists, not Ã Â la Zetkinâperhaps also with the Lettish
party and the Polish Social-Democrats (known as

  Â  

the Opposition)) do something very quickly, if we do not want to
miss this very important moment.  

Comrade Radek promised to translate our resolutions into
       German.[1]

You are already familiar with our Manifesto (of the Central Committee)âit
has been published, unfortunately in abbreviated form, in your
Tribune. David in his book quotes this Manifesto very
conscientiously (almost unbelievably so for an opportunist). We are sending
you Radekâs translation and would ask you to let us know as soon as you
can whether you consider it possible and advisable to prepare a joint
resolution and come for ward with a joint declaration of protest
against the âLeftâ conference (Zetkin & Co.). We, I believe,
shall do itâin one form or another.  

With best regards,

 N.Â Lenin 

P.S. Please show this also to Comrade Luteraan, with whom we once came
out together against the âMarshâ (the Centre), (naturally, if
you think it would be useful to show this letter to Comrade
Luteraan).  

Wl.Â Uljanow in SÃ¶renberg (Kanton Luzern) Schweiz. All this
is strictly confidential!

Dear Comrade, 

I am sending you the proofs.  

If the No. is full up (i.e., if there is quite enough copy),

  Â  

put it out at once. (Arrange the articles at your discretion:
       âDefeatââeditorial.[1]

)



If you have room, insert the enclosed postscript to the article âState
of
     Affairsâ.[2]


After this No. we shall immediately issue the next, carrying the
article on pacifism (has it been set up?). Write without delay, how much
copy you have for this (next) issue and how much you are short of!  

Regards,
 Yours,

SÃ¶renberg (Kt.Â Luzern)

 22/VII. 1915 

Dear Comrade Wijnkoop, 

I am sending you the resolutions of our Party, translated by Comrade
       Radek.[1]

It seems to meâafter having read your resolutionsâthat there definitely
exists agreement between us in principle.  

Comrade Radek writes me that we ought to jointly draw up theses, and
not resolutions (we, meaningâthe Dutch Social-Democratic Party, our
Party, the Polish Social-Democratic

  Â  

âOppositionâ, and probably also the Lettish Social-Democrats). I donât
think it matters muchâtheses or resolutions. What matters is that we
clearly and popularly formulate the revolutionary tactics, define the
imperialist nature of the war and defend Marxism against falsification by
Kautsky, Plekhanov & Co.  

Unfortunately, Radek has not yet sent me his draft declaration. I hope
that you, on reading our resolutions, will answer me in the shortest
possible time whether you agree with us in principle. Everything
should be ready by August 7â10.  

If you can say quite definitely whether any one of your people
could be in Berne between AugustÂ 7 and 10, then perhaps it would be
possible to arrange a small conference in Berne and jointly draw up the
theses. If not, we shall have to arrange it by correspondence, and this
will take a long time.  

With best regards,

 Yours,

N.Â Lenin 

P.S. Radek tells me that you are on very good terms with Charles
Kerr, the Chicago publisher. We are publishing in Russian
(and eventually in German) a small pamphlet (about 100,000 printerâs ems)
with our resolutions and explanations. Could you inquire of Charles Kerr
whether he would agree (and on what terms) to publish our pamphlet in
       English?[2]


P.P.S. I shall try to formulate and send you the draft. Your proposal
to establish contact with other Leftists (Britain, Sweden, France, etc.)
meets with our whole-hearted approval.

Dear Comrade, 

I sent you today a wire asking you to substitute the article on
pacifism (Grigoryâs) for my article âThe State of Affairs in
S.D.â[1]

in the current issue of the C.O. If this is now too late, please have all
the other material set upâwe shall put out another No. of the
C.O. immediately.  

How about the
      pamphlet?[2]

Can Kuzma set it up? (About

  Â  

100,000 ems. Desirably more cheaplyâin two columns, requiring
less paper. Let him give an exact estimate and indicate the date.)  

Best regards,

(Return Wijnkoop: isnât he a fine fellow!)  

I shall send the Russian books (the list).  

As regards the French, I am uncertain: most could be obtained by asking
one of the Berne people to order them from the Geneva and Neuch&ahattel
libraries (lots of rubbish:
I have seen some of them in Paris). Money mattersâin connection with the
following.  

Yuriâs enclosed letter (return it). is a sample of insolent, stupid
kulak mentality. It was formally decided here to publish Golay and
Varin.[2] The Publishing Committee is bound to carry out this
decision. Itâs just stupid wilfulness!! âItâs my purse and I do as I

(if they want) will have to be done here, and with the kulaks out of the
way, it will be easier for us.  

It was formally decided here that they give 1/2 for transport
and write us within a week about the instalment dates.  

Not a word! Itâs sheer mockery!  

Bukharinâs letter (return it!) shows that it is impossible for
us to go under such difficulties (with a strange passport? They will
uncover us and arrest us to oblige the
       tsar!).[1]

Money is dwindling: most of the remaining thousand will be spent on two
issues of the C.O.+the pamphlet. And the fare? And the high cost of living
in Stockholm? And conditions for work there (library) are worse.

 

We must think it over again and again.  

Wouldnât it be better to let these kulak-minded stupid-heads take an
airing?  

Send Golay to the C.O. (Golay must be published). I donât feel
like answering Yuri: that foolish, insolent letter of his is
insufferable. Where is the limit? Promises, formal decisionsâand âIâm
the boss, Iâm not going to payâ!! No, thereâs a limit to everything! This
is sheer barefaced lying!  

My regards to everybody,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

We havenât got that No. of Rech. Maybe Yuri has it?

Re âBibliography and Notesâ, I am for publishing them. What
is an extra 100â200 (less) frs.?  

The important thing is to have the issue all of a
     piece.[1]

It is important to have voices from everywhere (Golay, Sinclair,
Die Internationale) against the
social-chauvinists.[2] 

Are Yuri and the
Japanese[3] going? When?

I am sending Pannekoekâs
article.[4] I strongly advise giving it the enclosed editorial
tailpiece (which should be forwarded to the
       author).[1]


I am sending a rough plan of the pamphlet (return
it).[2]

I suggest that we sit down (both of us) immediately, and think over every
sentence, reword, condense andâpublish it in Russian (for the
anniversary of the war). And then in three other languages.  

I think two purposes can be served: 

1) A Vademecum for Russian Social-Democrats, agitators and âleading
workersâ. A clear, popular, precise summary of all arguments. A
clear summing-up: correctness of the expulsion of Nasha Zarya, the
struggle against it and against the Organising Committee+Chkheidze
[Vademecum for elections to the DumaÂ ].  

2) A precise statement for the people abroad: a political step
for welding the IIIÂ International more serious than a dozen talks and
meetings with a dozen Grimms, Zetkins and suchlike
   Klatsch-Weiber[3]

in trousers and skirts.  

Answer without delay. If you agree, we shall discuss the plan in
still greater detail, and then divide the subjects.  

3) The O.C. riffraff will be induced to come forward with a platform of
âtheir ownâ, but they have nothing of their own!  

Could you send me cuttings of Hamburger Echo gems?  A
gem in Wiener Arbeiter-Zeitung: a letter from Russia that
Axelrod is making concessions to the
âopportunistsâ.[5] I shall send it to you.  
APPENDIX TO LETTER

From the editors. We fully agree in all essentials with
Comrade A.Â Pannekoekâs excellent article, but find its last lines too
pessimistic. We have the rank and file behind

  Â  

us: the opportunists, social-chauvinists and Kautskians have a minority,
often a negligible minority consisting of officials, aristocracy, petty
bourgeois and philistines. Given correct tactics against the opportunists,
i.e., if they are expelled and a consistent struggle waged against them, we
shall have the support also of the big organisations, of the legal and
illegal apparatus of the revolutionary party.

Dear V.Â K., 

We accept Kuzmaâs terms. The pamphlet has already
been writtenâthe whole of
       it.[1]

I can send the MS. even earlier, if this can speed up the
issue. Please wire (or telephoneâbest of all at 8.30â9 a.m.âHotel
Marienthal in SÃ¶renberg, Kanton Luzern) whether the pamphlet
could be sent earlier. It is extremely important for us to speed
it up.  

And so we are issuing another number of the C.O. (the article on
pacifism is to go as an editorial; I am sending more copy), and immediately
afterwards the pamphlet. (It has about 115,000Â ems, I believe. But this
makes only a slight difference.)  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

I am sending the pamphlet to Geneva (they agree to do 100,000Â ems for
150Â frs. and very quickly at that).  

I have accepted practically all your amendments.  

To your part I have made negligible ones: I shall send them to
you in the proofs (if you want, we can ask for them earlier).  

We must do all we can to speed up the issue of the C.O. Your
article will have 375lines!!! No news items (practically). Will
you write 112 a column on âWarâ? Iâll write about self-determination and
a United States of
       Europe.[1]
Go lay must go in the C.O. if the Japanese donât agree to have it
in Kommunist, for Golay must be boosted for all heâs
     worth![2]


Answer about the C.O. without delay, hurry as fast as you can.


Is it worth while putting in my article on
      Quarck?[3]


How could the draft declaration have got lost (it is condensed
resolutions)?? It was in an envelope for you!!!  

We shall ask Radek for it. [If you find it, return it
without delay!!]  

I am enclosing Varin and a letter to Yuri.  

Regards,
 Yours,

 Lenin 

I have sent all my proofs back to
 Benteli.[4]

If the letter has gone astray, let the proofs be sent again.

Olga writes that we must hurry up like anything with the
C.O.âotherwise Kuzma will take on other work!  

Yet we have little material!! Scandalous!!  

I am sending today a small article âOn the Slogan for a United States
of Europeâ direct to the printing shop (asking them to send the proofs to
you)â(written on the lines we discussed. We must be sure to correct the
mistake before the pamphlet comes out, and insert in the pamphlet a comment
on the
      Manifesto[1]

).

 [[

In the pamphlet I shall add the 1913 resolution on the national question.

]]]



I am sending you an article on the national programme (I would have
liked to rewrite it; itâs not the thing, Iâm afraid; I would have preferred
to hold it
       over).[2]

Olga has 400Â lines of copy+125 United States of Europe, and altogether the
issue will have 736lines!!  

Send Olga by Monday morning without fail (generally, by the first
post) some more material. I donât think itâs worth giving
       Quarck[3]

alongside of your article.  


[[BOX: 

No.Â 111 of Nashe Slovo had
it.[4]
 || 

Was Braun in Nashe Slovo?

We ought to have an article on Russia, if only a small one. 

    (I was ill and couldnât work until yesterday.)  

Regards to everybody,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

P.S. Thanks for the pamphlets.

 If thereâs nothing else, send Golay to the C.O.  

In the pamphlet you forgot to put in the figures of the number of
workers in âourâ and the liquidatorsâ gubernias. Send them in.

Dear Comrade, 

I am sending an article for
No.Â 44[1]

(the proofs of it please send to both Grigory and me simultaneously (and
those on pacifism too), have two impressions made. Grigoryâs address: Herrn
Radomyslski bei Fr. Aschwanden Hertenstein in Kanton
Luzern).  

Grigory will send in more copy for No.Â 44 by Monday.  

We must at all costs get No.Â 44 out immediately, without a
break in the work (even if it means paying Kuzma for a working day, etc.),
and then start on setting up the pamphlet. I repeat, it is lying on my desk
fully completed. I shall send it in by the middle of next week, but if
issue can be speeded up, I shall send it immediately on receipt of your
wire.  

No.Â 43 is got up excellently! Thanks very much.  

Regards,
 Yours,

 Lenin

30/VII.1915 

Dear Comrade, 

I received your letter and postcard. I am sending you the complete
French translation of our Manifesto; I have already sent you the
translation of our Partyâs resolutions, made by Radek. You now have all the
documents (as regards the âUnited States of Europeâ, I think we shall
adopt Gorterâs point of view).  

I am very glad that we agree in essentials. What we need is not the
solemn declarations of leaders (against which Pannekoek has written so
well), but a consistent revolutionary declaration of principles to help the
workers find the correct path. This is most essential. I was particularly
pleased to hear that you are in touch with the Belgian friends (we could
send P.Â Golayâs pamphlet for them, if you havenât already seen
it[1]) and wish to talk personally with some of the Leftists
in another country. If the Belgian anonymous group âÃtoileâ and
another, German, group published a declaration of principles together with
your and our partyâthis would be a good and serious beginning. The
Swedish Left with HÃ¶glund are on our side: I received a letter today
about this. It would be a good thing if you wrote to England and persuaded
some group there (if only a small one) to draft a joint declaration.  

Sincere regards and wishing you success.  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin 

P.S. The second preliminary conference was to be held on AugustÂ 7, but
it will probably be held later.

Dear V.Â K., 

I am greatly worried about the pamphlet. I hope you have received
everything (the whole manuscript and comment on the Manifesto)? How is the
type-setting going on and when do you hope to get it out? I shall be
waiting for the proof-sheets. (The headings of the small subsections
of the chapters should be set up either in italics or nonpareil but in no
case in bold type.)  

What about No.Â 44 of the C.O.? I had no proofs and put this down to
your wanting to speed up the issue (as we had agreed). But the United
States article went in, didnât it?  

Drop me a line.  

Regards,
 Yours,

 Lenin 

Did you find the 1913 resolution on the national question?

Dear Comrade, 

I enclose herewith the declaration, which we received from the
Norwegian Jugendbund. The Bulgarian Social-Democrats (âTesnyakiâ) have
expressed the same views in principle at the Second Balkan Conference (in
July of this
year).[1] Consequently, a Left international declaration of principles
is possible. By AugustÂ 20 it should be ready.  
 

Looking forward eagerly to your reply and draft.  

With best wishes,

 (Signature) 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Second Balkan Social-Democratic Conference was held in
Bucharest from JulyÂ 6 to 8, 1915. It was attended by representatives of the
labour movement of Rumania, Bulgaria and Greece. The Serbian
Social-Democratic Party was unable to send its representative, but the
leadership of the party sent a message of greetings to the conference. The
conference inaugurated the Balkan Workersâ Social-Democratic Federation,
adopted a Declaration of Principles of the Balkan Workersâ
Social-Democratic Federation, a resolution on the Balkan Social-Democratic
Federation and the International, and a special resolution âAgainst
Provocations, for Peace and Federation!â

Return Peuple. Good about Vandervelde, eh? Such will be the
tactics of all of them.  

I havenât a single line from Radek and Karpinsky. Itâs baffling! I am
writing them.  

Grimm phoned to say that the Vorkonferenz has been put off
till 5.IX and that Zetkin has asked him from prison to send her the
resolution of the minority at the Berne
     Conference.[1]

I have sent the Russian text. If you have the German, send it to Grimm.


We shall send JaurÃ¨s after we have read
it.[2] 

I have given âJâaccuseâ to
Radek.[3] 

Return
Kolb.[4] 

From the Dutchânil!!  

P.S. I advise putting it in (see the text), having the German
expressions translated.  

I donât see why you should defend the Japanese. Alexander writes
indignant letters, and be has a right to be indignant. Adopted
decisions should be carried out: it was decided (3Â weeks ago) within a
week!! And now within another month!??? 

Theyâre cheats, and Iâm not going to wink at their cheating.

  Â  

I have a right to demand and will demand from them statements in
writing and secretariesâ minutes of general decisions (so
that we can catch the cheats, who want to break away and throw the
blame onto us!).  

Are they leaving? When? Or not? Two fools engaged in counting money
could have figured out in 3Â months how much 100Â rubles is worth in frs. or
how much No.Â 1 costs. These are just flimsy excusesâitâs simply
ridiculous. They will be getting 10Â frs. a time from Russia,
feeding us with promises and fooling the shippers!! Adopting decisions just
to fool us!!  No, they wonât get away with this.  

Lenin 

N.B. Bukharin occasionally (pp.Â 133, 132, 129 in the sub-headings) leaves the old expression
social-state trust (corrected in other places to state-capitalist
trust).[5] 

Is this an oversight or deliberate??  

You write that you are keeping notes, âhoping to secure
itâ. Fulfilment of old decisions?? By what means?? By âtalksâ?


I donât agree to such relations.  

P.S. Sheets (and leaflets) should be written and sent to
Alexander.

Dear Comrade Wijnkoop, 

Radek writes me he had informed you that the conference (not the
Vorkonferenz but the conference itself) was

  Â  

to be held on 5.IX. You, too, probably are already familiar with Radekâs
draft. This draft seems to me rather academic (this objection, of course,
is unimportant) andâwhat is far more importantâunsatisfactory in regard
to the most important point, which is driven home so well, for in stance,
in Gorterâs pamphlet, namely: a decisive struggle against opportunism. If
we are silent about this before the workers, we shall be hushing up a
circumstance without which nothing real can be created.  

Will you please let me know your opinion and the opinion of your
Central Committee. Also, whether a representative of your party is coming
for certain (and if not, would you give Radek a mandate or send a
declaration, etc.). If possible, write to England, to the minority of the
British Socialist Party; let this minority send either a representative, or
at least a declaration. If, as a result of this conference, we receive not
only diplomatic conjuring tricks of the leaders (so well ridiculed by
Pannekoek), but also a Left Marxist international declaration of
principles, it will be a very useful thing.  

The group of Belgian internationalists, of whom you know, should also
send a declaration or give you a mandate (sections of parties will
certainly be admitted too). An anti-chauvinist opposition to
Vanderveldeâhowever smallâwould be extremely important. It is the first
step that counts!  

Awaiting your reply,

 With S.D. greetings,

 N.Â Lenin 

P.S. I enclose the draft declaration (in French)âI have not yet had
time to discuss it with my friends. Tomorrow I shall send this draft to
Comrade Radek.

I am for No.Â 1 (August) and No.Â 2
     (September).[1]

50Â pages for an article is yourâpardonâfantasy.  

Yuri should not be included in the
delegation.[3] He doesnât know any foreign language. No sense in it. To
pay court to them is harmful. We have one âlady editorââdo you want
another âdelegate from the C.C. delegationâ? Better not.  

I canât write about Russia. Send Bukharinâs letter. I do not see
any newspapers. (I have only Rech.)  

Itâs annoying that Radek has not been copied. If corrections, the
following should be added:

     1) mention of Basle

     2) illeg. org., etc. But is it worth sending him
 corrections? (for Trotsky?)  
 

Yuri writes that Trotsky will be the only one from Nashe
Slovo. This will make cheating still easier for them.  

Will Kamenski be there? I doubt it!! Write to him
immediately, for you have spoken to him.  

I remember you saying that Grimm wanted the conference to be
not in Berne. Are we to return to Berne? If so, 1.IX is too
early. (Maybe you will go a bit earlier, or do you have special
business to see to there?)  

Alexander wants to go to Russia. I am writing him, supporting this
plan.[2]

A pity there are no C.C. men. Heâs the man for us, if it were not for
Kollontai (she is going to America to lecture and carry on internationalist
agitation).  

Ludmila has found herself (sic!) without money or a passport!!
I donât think she will go anywhere.  

She has brought French books, which we shall send to you after perusal
(and you return Rappoport, after perusal:
I sent it to you without having had time to read it).  

Regards,
 Yours,

 Lenin 

What about Karpinskyâs article for Kommunist?  

Re the draft resolution, I sent it to you (=draft of condensed
resolution). Did you make a copy? If not, I can send you one. If we are to
prepare our own draft we must hurry.  


P.S. â300 yearsâ is no good, in my opinion. Must be rewritten for the
legal publication.

Dear Comrade Olga, 

As regards elections, I really donât know what to answer. At the first
blush, why shouldnât elections in a republic be held from top to bottom?
But beyond this first blush I know nothing: neither the nature of the body
to which elections have to be held, nor the correlation of parties within
it, nor the history of the question, nor past experience. It is difficult
to judge under such conditions, for the âfirst blushâ alone is
insufficient, of course.  

Regards,
 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. Did the 200Â frs. help to get round Kuzmikha? Keep me informed by
postcards: âa bulletin of Kuzmikhaâs moods and the chances of
successâ. Both you (and we) are fed up with Kuzma, I understand, but what
can we do?

Dear Comrade, 

With the greatest of pleasure I learned from your letter that you agree
on the whole with my draft. The conference is to take place on
SeptemberÂ 5. We hope that several French socialists of the Left will attend
it. The whole thing is being organised by Grimm and Morgan. Your presence,
in my opinion, would be very useful, and I would ask you to write to Grimm
immediately.  

Sincerely yours

Letts??  Is it possible that they

wonât be invited!? If I go

I have had a postcard from Kollontai. She is going it full tilt.

Answer Meshcheryakov.  

I advise getting Shklovsky to tackle Grimm (either if he is going 1.IX)
or by telephone. We must get a reply from Grimm.  

You to write the report (on
Russia)[1] (if need be I will send you Rech).  

I believe a resolution will suffice (we have a draft: âcondensedâ. It
can be corrected). Why make a declaration? If we find a common language
with Radek, we can write it there. If not, and if we are on our own, then
what need is there for a declaration, who is it for?  

My regards to everybody,

 Yours,

 Lenin

We must start preparing an issue of the C.O. devoted wholly to
the conference. Subjects or
articles.[3]


Etwa: 

 1.
    Vorgeschichte[1]

   and correspondingly the IIIÂ International.  
 2. Reports (Balkans apart).  
 3. Debates with Ledebour (discussion in general on points of
   principle). (Three shadings among the Germans.)

   Comparison with womenâs || 
 4.  Significance of the conference (first step to the
   IIIÂ International; half-hearted and inconsistent step towards a
   split with opportunism. Possibility of a ârelapseâ).  
 5. Our resolution and our draft Manifesto, our statement on the
   Manifesto.  
 6. The Bund and O.C. men+Trotsky (Massenaktionen).  
 7. Official Manifesto.  


Do you agree to my taking Nos.Â 3 and 4?  

Let us make haste with this issue of the C.O.  

I am sending Bauer.  

Be sure to send me

 1) Legienâs
   collection+Â ...[2]
 2) the pamphlet on Liebknecht.  

Return Radekâs letter.  

Plan of leaflets is drawn up; will send it tomorrow; detailed.

[3]
This refers to the First International Socialist Conference, held
in Zimmerwald from SeptemberÂ 5 to 8, 1915. A sharp struggle developed
at the conference between the revolutionary internationalists led by Lenin
and the Kautskyite majority at the conference led by the German
Social-Democrat Ledebour.  

During the proceedings a Bureau of the Zimmerwald Left was formed
headed by Lenin.  


The Zimmerwald Left did a great deal towards organising the
internationalist elements in Europe and America.  

Sotsial-Demokrat No.Â 45â46 published Leninâs articles âThe
First Stepâ and âRevolutionary Marxists at the International Socialist
Conference, SeptemberÂ 5â8, 1915â (see present edition, Vol.Â 21,
pp. 383â88 389â93). In accordance with PointÂ 2 of the letter, the
newspaper published a column of extracts âFrom Re ports Read at the
International Socialist Conference in Zimmerwaldâ first place in which was
given to the Bulgarian M.Â P. Vasil Kolaroff. In accordance with PointÂ 6 of
the letter, the following paragraphs were published in the âNews Itemsâ
column: âThe Bund Has No Timeâ, âAll Is Well With the 0.C.â, âTrotsky
âDoes Not Knowâ What Mass Revolutionary Action Isâ.





[4]
This refers to Wijnkoopâs letter of AugustÂ 6, 1915, in which two
documents were mentioned: =

1) the report of the representative of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. concerning the
preliminary conference held on July!11, 1915, dealing with the question of
convening the international conference, and =

2) the draft resolution of the Zimmerwald Left for the First International
Socialist Conference written by Lenin (see present edition, Vol.Â 21,
pp. 345â48).  

Wijnkoop wrote âwe fully and wholly agree with the proposals of the
C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. concerning the terms for convening the
conference. In speaking of âextremely important argumentsâ against
participation in the conference, Lenin had in mind the following passage in
Wijnkoopâs letter: âOur Party Committee earnestly requests you to declare
... that your Party, like ours, will not attend any conference
that does not accept this minimum as a basis for convening the conference,
as it will not be possible then to declare that it is a conference of the
revolutionary section of the Internationalâ (Central Party Archives of the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism under the C.C., C.P.S.U.).

Dear V.Â K., 

We havenât received the pamphlet yet. We want to put out a double issue
of the C.O. with a report on the inter national conference of the Left in
Berne. How about Kuzmikha? Could she be âbuttered upâ by payment for the
pamphlet (you have the money, havenât you?)? Or is it hopeless?  And no
prospect of issuing it in the near future? Drop me a line, please, as
to whether we can know where we stand.  

I received Yegorâs letters and will answer him in a day or two
through you.  

All the best,

 Yours,

Dear V.Â K., 

I am sending you Journal de GenÃ¨ve. It appears that I
put it away somewhere before my departure and forgot about it. Iâm awfully
glad I have found it and not made myself look quite a pig in your eyes.


Re the C.O., Grigory advises having it published in Berne (this Is a
double number, 4Â pages on the conference of the Left), if there is no hope
with regal!d to Kuzmikha. Drop me a line âto make assurance doubly sureâ
(as I am already well aware how helpless we all are where Kuzmikha is
concerned).  

About the lecture. I would like to read it about mid-October on the
subject: âThe International Socialist Conference of 5â8.1X.1915â. If
suitable, we could organise it in advance (perhaps you could
print bills for other towns, too, leaving a space for the town and
the date). Could it bring in anything (I am devilishly hard up), is it
opportune, etc.? Everyone (the Socialist-Revolutionaries,
Nashe Slovo and others) will publish something about the
conference, but I would go into details.  

I am writing to Kharitonov in
       Zurich.[1]


Best regards,

 Yours,

Lenin 

P.S. I am enclosing a letter for Socialist-Revolutionary
âYegorâ. Please read it arid give it to him. If convenient, have
a talk with him and let me know your opinion of him and his friends. What
sort of people are they?

19/IX. 1915 

Dear Comrade, 

Comrade Kollontai has forwarded your letter on to me. I have read and
reread it attentively. I can understand your passionate protest against the
emigrant colony, which apparently did anything but please you. The
experience of 1905, however, has proved, in my opinion, that there are
emigrants and emigrants. Part of the emigrant body, which prior to 1905 had
devised the slogans and tactics of revolutionary Social-Democracy, proved
in the years 1905â07 to be closely linked with the mass revolutionary
movement of the working class in all its forms. The same applies
today, in my opinion. If the slogans are correct, if the tactics are the
right ones, the mass of the working class, at a given stage of development
of its revolutionary movement, is bound to come round to these
slogans. You write that for the people âPlekhanov is merely a nameâ. I
cannot agree with this, although, perhaps, the difference between us here
is only a seeming one. Plekhanov is the most striking, and in Russia,
thanks to the bourgeois and liquidator press, the most popular
exponent of the extremely wide spread âpeopleâsâ patriotism. In showing
up Plekhanov we are, in fact, answering a host of questions, thoughts,
doubts, and so on, that arise in the minds of the people. But, of course,
it is up to an intelligent propagandist and agitator to translate
the dispute of a revolutionary inter nationalist Marxist with Plekhanov
into another language, to approach the matter in a different way,
to make allowance for the specific qualities of the environment, etc., etc.


For that matter, you probably take the same view your self, since you
distinguish only the âLeft trendsâ (the
Socialist-Revolutionaries and Social-Democrats) and our dispute with
Plekhanov & Co. is precisely that of determining and separating trends.


As to the urgency of the problem of sending people to Russia you are
quite right. We do what we can in this field lately.  
 

The other day I received another letter from a Socialist-Revolutionary,
who writes that after the conference of the Trudoviks+Popular
Socialists+Socialist-Revolutionaries in Russia (a chauvinist
conference)[2] he gives the Socialist-Revolutionary Party up as a bad
job. I, too, doubt whether it has any viable elements in it. At
any rate, I consider it a fact that there are now 2Â main
revolutionary trends in Russia: the revolutionary chauvinists (to
over throw the tsar in order to defeat Germany) and the
revolutionary-proletarian internationalists (to overthrow the tsar as a
means of assisting the international revolution of the
proletariat). Any rapprochement between these trends beyond occasional
âjoint actionsâ is, in my opinion, impossible and harmful. The war has
linked together the proletariat of all the great powers of Europe,
the war has placed on the order of the day the task of putting
into effect proletarian solidarity. A difficult task, to be sure, but one
that is posed by life itself and cannot be shelved.  

If you are going to work in Russia and should you wish to help the Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Left Social-Democrats, I would advise
giving help to each of them separately, helping to
    link[1]

the respective groups, both in different places among themselves, and with
the centres abroad. The Social-Democrats separately, the
Socialist-Revolutionaries separately. This will yield definite
benefit and make for less squabbling. Rapprochement,
when possible, will proceed more normally. There will be greater
trust.  

I wish you every success and all the best.  

With socialist greetings,

 Lenin 

P.S. You may write to me at the address printed in our Geneva
Sotsial-Demokrat.

Literature will gain from the establishment of such

I am sending you
       Axelrod,[1]
Neue Zeit (donât lose it and donât give it to anybody) and No.Â 1
of the
Bulletin.[3] I am waiting for the German pamphlet.  

The letter to the Japanese is no good as it is, in my opinion. The tone
is for a break. If there is to be a break, it is not for this
reason. Either send this in your own name, or we shall alter it completely
(in a tone of friendly exhortation and discreet intimation of
their error).  

I am sending you Radekâs letter (return it). He is naÃ¯ve to the point
of holiness. Grimm is a scoundrel who has to be closely watched. (To this
day I have not been able to get our Resolutionsentwurf!!!)  

I am enclosing Kamenevâs letter. I have answered him, pointing out that
the situation is serious (spoilt) and must be seriously rectified.  

Write the editorial for the Central Organ, but not more than
10,000Â ems. (No room for more!) It must include a slashing criticism
of the Organising Committeeâs leaflet (3.IX.1915, âThe Tasks of the
Russian Proletariatâ) with the slogan (liberal) of Constituent
Assembly. For our 3Â pillars, against the Cadets, against the
chauvinist revolutionaries and for the international revolution of the
    proletariat.[2]


Wait a day or two (donât write about Russia in the C.O. yet).  

Tomorrow I shall send you âThe Tasks of the Russian Proletariatâ and
maybe my own draft.  

Best regards,

 Lenin

I am sending you Grimmâs

We must do our best and assert ourselves.  

With the C.O. itâs the devil to pay. 75Â thousand ems of copy have been

If you agree with the answer to Grimm, send it to Shklovsky
who is to call on Radek and translate it with him. If you do not
agree, return it.  

We are going to Berne on Sunday or Monday.  

I am sending the letter from the Japanese. Return it. What is
to be done about the meeting of the Editorial Board? (It would be good to
have 2Â articles about the conference in No.Â 3 of Kommunist.)

[2]
In this letter Grimm proposed on behalf of the I.S.C. that an enlarged
I.S.C. should be set up and asked to be notified by whom the C.C. of the
R.S.D.L.P. would be represented on it. For Leninâs reply see present
edition, Vol.Â 21, pp. 372â77.

This refers to the Joint Declaration of the French and German
Delegations at the International Socialist Conference in Zimmerwald,
published in Sotsial-Demokrat No. 45â46 for OctoberÂ 11, 1915.





[4]
This refers to the materials of the Zimmerwald Conference. The
newspaper Zhizn No.Â 15 for SeptemberÂ 26, 1915, reprinted the
conference materials from No.Â 1 of the I.S.C. Bulletin. In the
news paper Nashe Slovo No.Â 200 for SeptemberÂ 25, 1915, all the
materials concerning the conference were deleted by the censor.

Dear V.Â K., 

I am sending you the proof-sheets.  

Will Olga please answer my postcard of yesterday in greatest
possible detail.  

Do me a favourâget to know (from Stepko or Mikha, etc.) the name of
âKobaâ (Joseph J.....?? we have forgotten). Very important!!


Would you buy me (out of C.O. expenses) Romain Rollandâs pamphlet:
Au dessus de la m&ehatlÃ©e?  

Or is it unobtainable in Geneva?  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

Thanks for the Appeal to
Reason[1] you have sent me!!  

Send it more often!  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Appeal to Reasonânewspaper of the American socialists,
founded in Girard, Kansas, in 1895; was not connected officially with the
Socialist Party of America, but propagated socialist ideas and enjoyed
great popularity among the workers. Eugene Debs, the American socialist,
wrote for the paper.

Dear G.Â L., 

Please send 500 copies of the pamphlet (indicating Absender and
 registered)[1]

immediately and by the cheapest possible means to the following
address: 

|| 
Mr. L.Â Lore (for A.Â Kollontay)

 German Language Federation Socialist Party

 Spruce Street. 15. New York (N.Â Y.)

 United States of America.  
 

According to your calculation there are orders for 500+500=1,000
       (I.S.D.[2]

gratis or at 10Â pfg.?)+1,500 Jugend =2,500+500 America==3,000.  

It would be good to start on a 2ndÂ edition while the type is set up,
but we have no money. Couldnât we induce the
       Jugend,[3]

by giving them now 500 instead of 1,500, to arrange a deal
themselves with the Berne printing shop for a 2ndÂ edition? (How
much will it cost? If not much and if we can be sure that the Jugend will
not let us down, perhaps we could borrow the money and publish it
ourselves?)  

Will you please think this over well and arrange the
whole business.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 V.Â Ulyanov 

P.S. Please hand the enclosed letter to that Lett (who took my
address from you round about 5â8.IX and called on me in SÃ¶renberg on 10
or 11.IX.1915). Very urgent. Please find him as quickly as possible and
hand him the letter.  

Do not spend a kopek more money. Donât give it to any
body.

Dear Comrade, 

I was very glad to hear about your speech at Aarau and I
heartily congratulate you on the success. It couldnât have been
better.[3] 
 

(If you have a full verbatim report of the congress, please let me have
it if only for a short time.)  

Radek told me that he had advised you not to take the floor
first, as this on the part of a Russian would not be âtactfulâ (Radek
has proved to be entirely wrong), and it would be better if Platten
did it, etc.  

You proved to be entirely right!  

I donât think itâs worth having
       GezÃ¤nk[1]

with Radek over the âpigheadâ, etc. Trifles! A mere nothing! Scandal,
which the O.C. people, Dymki, etc., have always gone in for, and Ryazanov
now in particular (Radek too says he is furious: funny chap, what made him
poke his nose in things he doesnât understand?).  

Take no notice of the scandal, spend less time on the Zurich colonial
marsh, give more of it to contacts with Platten and the business
of publishing and circulating Internationale
FlugblÃ¤tter[4] (if you spend less time on the O.C. people &
Co. you will have more for Internationale FlugblÃ¤tter).  

The money for Internationale FlugblÃ¤tter (370Â copies?) and
the account (how many left over? How many given out on credit?
Total, etc.)  send direct to me (Plattenâs address has been given
only for outsiders).  

As regards the translation of Internationale FlugblÃ¤tter
No.Â 1 into Italian, I think our mutual acquaintance will help
you.[2]

She and Siefeldt have already found several Italian addresses; she has
found an Italian to go through the translation. You too. I think the first
thing to do now is to have it translated into Italian and given to an
Italian to be vetted. And then (avoiding Balabanova, who
apparently wonât be of any help and is even capable of being an obstacle)
it is necessary to start looking out for some newspaper or a league of
Italians in Switzerland who would agree to publish it at their own expense:
I donât think this is a utopia, as the publication of 2,000 copies will
cost 80Â frs., and at 10Â cts. each it will yield a profit.  

If a publisher cannot be found, then we shall try and publish it
ourselves, in which case distribution must be

  Â  

organised with special zeal: our mutual acquaintance, to whom I am writing,
will help us in this.  

I would ask you to maintain and cultivate in every way your
âclose acquaintanceâ with Platten: he is extremely important
just now for publication of Internationale FlugblÃ¤tter.  

Does Platten attend the meetings of the partyâs Executive? Does he have
the minutes? Has he a vote or not?Does he agree to
develop the decision on ârevolutionÃ¤re Aktionenâ to
keep it from being a dead letter? (In that case we should arrange
publications, pamphlets, supplements to Swiss papers concretising the idea
of ârevolutionÃ¤re Aktionenâ, and smuggle all this into Germany.) Does
he agree to help import Internationale FlugblÃ¤tter No.Â 1 into
Germany?  

How are things going with the sale of the pamphlet Sozialismus und
Krieg? Write. Drop the Zurich colony and get busy with the affairs der
Zimmerwalder Linken!  

All the best. My regards to your wife and all our friends.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Lenin is referring to M.Â M. Kharitonovâs speech at the Aarau
Congress vi the Swiss Social-Democratic Party held November 20â21,
1915. The central issue was the partyâs attitude to the Zimmerwald
internationalist group. The Bolshevik Kharitonov, a voting delegate from
one of the partyâs organisations, moved an amendment to Grimmâs Centrist
resolution; it called for a mass revolutionary struggle against the war and
declared that only a victorious proletarian revolution could put an end to
the imperialist war. The amendment of the Left was carried by 258 votes to
141.





[4]
In November 1915 the Zimmerwald Left issued a pamphlet in German
entitled Internationale FlÃ¼gblÃ¤tter No.Â 1 (Die
Zimmerwalder Linke Ã¼ber die Aufgaben der Arbeiterklasse)
(International Leaflet No.Â 1âthe Zimmerwald Left on the Tasks of the
Working Class).

I think we ought to go to Grimm and ask him to mark off
exactly (with a red pencil) what passages he âwants
deletedâ![1] 

Polemic? 

What about Trotsky and Vie OuvriÃ¨re?[2] 

Is the reference to Longuet-Pressemane less polemical

  Â  

than the reference to Chkheidze? BegrÃ¼ndung? The same can be found in
Trotsky and Vie OuvriÃ¨re.  

I have my doubts whether itâs any use having talks with Grimm. If he
confined himself to quite minor amendments, I would be for making
concessions. But that is improbable.  

In that case there are two alternatives: either we give up the idea of
publishing it in the Bulletin and issue a leaflet.  

Or we publish it in the Bulletin the way Grimm wants it, and
in addition issue it complete as a leaflet marked:
âPublished without censorshipâ.  

At any rate the main thing now is to get Grimmâs pencil marks
of what he wants deleted. Thatâs the main thing. Go about this
tactfullyâspeak him fair.  

I shall answer the rest this evening or tomorrow. I havenât had
time to read it all.  

Salut!
 Lenin

1916

15/I. 1916 

Dear Friend, 

Today the parcel containing papiers dâaffaires, three notebooks sent
from Berne by registered mail to
       Belinsky[1]

in Paris, has been returned. The sender forgot to put the number of the
house, and those damned post-office people went and returned it!! I have
sent it off today to Belinsky registered.  

We have the beginning of âfrictionâ with our Polish
       friend,[2]

who seems to have âtaken offenceâ over the discussion and wants to keep
our theses out of No.Â 2 of the
journal.[3] This looks like war with him. From Roland-Hoist an
extremely friendly letter reporting that her Dutch league on 2.I.1916 had
unanimously joined the Zimmerwald Left!  Trotsky has lost another ally!!
The journal, Dutch-German, is already being set up; contributors from other
countries are badly needed, but everything and all contacts should be given
only to me or to my young Russian friend (by no means to the
non-Russian, vous comprenez?).  

Now quite another story: 

It is a glorious sunny day today, with a light snow. After influenza my
wife and I took our first walk along the road to Frauen-Kapellen where the
three of usâyou remember?âhid that lovely stroll one day. I kept
thinking of it and was sorry you were not here.  
 

By the way. Iâm rather surprised that there is no news from you. Let me
confess, while Iâm at it, that the thought occurred to me for a moment that
you might have âtaken offenceâ at my not having gone to see you off the
day you left. I did think that, I must confess, but I dismiss the unworthy
thought, I have driven it from my mind.  

This is my second postcard to you. Maybe the first one went astray? I
repeat the important advice: reread Nos.Â 5 and 6 of Nashe Slovo
ever so carefully!! Kollontai sends good news from America, she is
publishing Internationale FlugblÃ¤tter. From Russia too there is
good news.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 V.Â Lenin

Sotsial-Demokrata No.Â 1, October 1916 (see present edition, Vol.Â 22,

Vorboteâa theoretical journal, organ of the Zimmerwald Left;
appeared in German in Berne. Its official publishers were Henriette
Roland-Hoist and Anton Pannekoek. Lenin took an active part in founding the
journal, and after the issue of No.Â 1 in organising a French translation of
it for wider circulation.

19/I. 1916 

Dear Friend, 

This is my third postcard to you. This time in French, to make the work
easier for the censors, if they are the cause of this delay with the
mail. As a matter of fact I have been worrying for several days now at the
absence of any news from you! If you were offended with me, you would
probably have written to other friends, but as far as I know you have not
written to anybody. If I donât get a letter from you within the next few
days I shall write to our friends to find out whether you are ill. I have
inquired several times about poste restante mail, but there is nothing.


The conflict with our young Polish friend has been settled
satisfactorily; it was just a slight âmisunderstandingâ (that is his
statement of the case). Now everything is going well;

  Â  

the journal is already being made up; it should be issued in
       January.[1]


We have written to âyourâ editor in one of the towns of Romansh
    Switzerland.[2]

He simply doesnât answer. Strange, is it not? We are all looking forward to
your making arrangements about novels and short stories in Paris, where you
will probably find lots of people, writers, publishers and so on, since you
are working in the National Library and are well acquainted with these
people.  

The weather is fine. Last Sunday we went for a lovely walk up âourâ
little mountain. The view of the Alps was very beautiful; I was so sorry
you were not there with us.  

Recently Camille Huysmans delivered a very long âdiplomaticâ speech
at the congress of the Dutch
party.[3] I donât know whether you will be able to find the text of it
in the French newspapers. If you donât, you will find it here. He touched,
âin passingâ, on the September conference and protested strongly against
the âattempts at expropriationâ (he doesnât want to be âexpropriatedâ,
this secretary!) and so on and so forth. A big diplomatist, a
politician!... What unworthy means!  

How are you getting on? Are you content? Donât you feel lonely? Are you
very busy? You are causing me great anxiety by not giving any news about
yourself!... Where are you living? Where do you eat? At the âbuffetâ of
the National Library?  

Again I ask for letters poste restante.  

Sincerely yours,

 Basil 

P.S. Again nothing! No letters from you.

Friday 

Dear Friend, 

Only today did we receive your long letter: which was most
welcome. This is my fourth letter to you: all the first three postcards
were poste restante. If you havenât received them, then they either go
astray or else there are special rules (or misrules) in regard to poste
restante mail. Trotsky has written to our young Polish friend that he is
not going to write for the Dutch
       journal[1]

himself and cannot advise his friends of the nation among whom he is living
to do so. It looks like there is no avoiding a fight with Trotsky even on
this question!!  

We received a postcard today from your
      brother.[2]

It is good to know that he has received something (either a letter or a
No. of our newspaper for the end of March) and writes about
âsympathyâ. There is more sympathy, he says, in his part of the world
than he expected.  

By the way, I nearly forgot (I am in a great hurry to get this off by
the next train). If there are special misrules regarding poste restante
mail, maybe that is the reason why I do not receive any letters (I
have not had a single one from you), though you do write? Let me
know at once:
if you underline the date twice, it will mean that you do receive
my letters and write to me. Write to the same ad dress at which we
received your long letter.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

Why didnât you give your address before???

Sunday evening 

Dear Comrade, 
I have just learned that an international conference of the bureaux of
the youth leagues is to be held at Zurich on Wednesday. The
Norwegians and Swedes should be there (their youth leagues, as you know,
joined the Zimmerwald Left).  

Will you please
1) find out (tactfullyâall this is secret) about this
in detail: the date, place, duration, composition;
2) ascertain whether a representative of our Party can attend; try to make
this possible and get in yourself;
3) make a special attempt to find out, as quickly as you can, who exactly
is going to be there from Scandinavia, get in touch with them, see them,
and put them in touch with us as soon as possible.  

Drop me a line that you have received this letter and saying what you
hope to do.  

Salut!
 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. Please thank Siefeldt on my behalf for the books and tell
him I hope to get Przegl&awhatthed Socjaldemokratyczny from him
in Zurich.  

P.P.S. I will arrive, probably, before 10th-11th; maybe
7thâ9th.

I personally consider that with the appearance of Gazeta
Robotnicza (II.1916) our joint struggle in Russian and Polish affairs
is ruled out. Not because of the âattackâ on the âdefeatistsâ
(this is only a symptom), but in view of the resolution of the P.S.D. on
Russian
affairs.[1] If the P.S.D. in February 1916 does not come out openly and
definitely for a split in Russia, then this is merely a preparation for
another 16.VII.1914.  

And so, in my opinionâa struggle in the Russian, Polish and German
pressâand (I, at least, am for it) joint actions in Switzerland (where
the national question is not at all an urgent one, and it should therefore
as far as possible be kept separate).  

As this is my own personal opinion, I am sending all your
letters to Grigory.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

No.Â 25 of the newspaper Gazeta Robotnicza, the illegal organ
of the opposition Warsaw Committee of the Social-Democratic Party of Poland
and Lithuania, published the resolutions of the conference of the Editorial
Board of June 1â2, 1915. These resolutions were criticised by Lenin in his
âLetter from the Committee of the Organisations Abroad to the Sections of
the R.S.D.L.P.â (see present edition, Vol.Â 22, pp. 157â60).  

Further down Lenin refers to the voting of the Polish Social-Democrats
(the opposition) for the resolution of the I.S.B. at the Brussels âUnityâ
Conference of July 16â18, 1914.

Liebe Freunde, 

Please send me as quickly as you can Tagwacht containing
Radekâs articles on Gorter and two articles about the Australian
labour movement. I am also waiting for the proof-sheets
(1) of my articles in the C.O. and
(2) of the German theses (do not print them until you receive my
reply: I am considering another little
     amendment).[1]

 

I am also waiting for your article for the C.O. and an exact plan of
the issue.  

Please give my address to Radek and ask him from me to send me the
promised cutting from VorwÃ¤rts of 12.I.1916 (RÃ¼hleâs
article on the split and the editorsâ reply). I am lecturing here on
Wednesday, so I have very little time. There is tongue-wagging here about
the position of the
  â5Â secretariesâ[2]

being desperate (Russia against them) and their only hope is that Chkheidze
will lift his voice from the ârostrumâ, crying: for Zimmerwald!!


Beste GrÃ¼&Bwhatthee!

Dear Friend, 

I know that you are interested in science, and not in
politics. Nevertheless your sympathies, I have no doubt about it, are with
France. The split among the German socialists, as one French minister
expressed it, is not a matter of indifference to France. Therefore we must
help inform the Russians as well as the French about this. Otto RÃ¼hle,
M.P., plumped in VorwÃ¤rts for a split. But it should definitely
be added: not âonlyâ Otto RÃ¼hle, but also the group of
International Socialists of Germany (lâHumanitÃ©, too, wrote
about it). Please insert this when next writing to Petrograd. And also the
following: only Otto RÃ¼hle and the International Socialists of
Germany declared plainly for a split and against the âmarshâ; as to the
Internationale group (the German group of whom also Homo
wrote in lâHumanitÃ©: a beauty of a newspaper!)âthis group is

  Â  

wavering: the majority in it are clearly turning back to the marsh. This is
obvious from this groupâs recent
âthesesâ[1] and from the press statements of StrÃ¶bel in Neue
Zeit and from the newspaper Die
Gleichheit.[2] So donât forget to add this! Science is everything
to you, but a little sympathy towards France, a lot of sympathy, I
should say, you undoubtedly have!  

Salutations cordiales!

 Lenin

I have sent
Self-Defence.[4] 

I agree that No.Â 52 has to be issued, and I undertake to write an
article on the tasks of the conference of
23/IV[5] (or on the âpeace programmeâ, etc.âgenerally on the
editorial subject of immediate
       tasks).[1]


Nadya has translated the
Manifesto.[6] I shall send it to you in a day or two, and you send me
the MSS. of the articles and paragraphs you are writing for No.Â 52. We
shall prepare everything in manuscript and then hand it all in to be set
up.  

The article reporting the meeting of 5â8.II should be cut and a
paragraph inserted about Orn. in Nos.Â 51 and 52 of Nashe
Slovo[7] and about Nashe Slovo generally (I am writing
this).  

Send a cutting from
    Dyen[2]

about our victory in the insurance councils (and ask Kasparov,
also Abram and others, to follow Novoye Vremya and other
newspapers and collect everything there is about this).  
 

It is very important to find out whether Chkheidze spoke about
Zimmerwald in the Duma. I read his speech only as
reported in Leipziger Volkszeitung: there isnât a word
there about Zimmerwald. Try, through Radek, to trace Chkheidzeâs speech in
the Social-Democratic press of Germany as fully as possible
(Martov & Co. speculate on what Chkheidze said or is going to say
for Zimmerwald).  

I am drawing up the theses for our âAntragâ for 23/IV on the âpeace
programmeâ.  

Should we enlist Radekâs co-operation for this job? I donât think we
should. Radek is behaving so meanly!
   IÂ still[3]

havenât got many copies of the theses, and I find it
repugnant to write to Radek, seeing that he is out for
squabbles.  

Why didnât you answer whether you sent my insertion to the theses to be
set up? You could have handed it in to the printing shop yourself
and get the proofs from there (and order many copies: oh,
to hell with him, that Dreckseele von Radek!). We have the right,
as authors, to order the proofs of the theses.  

We must get from Grimm Bulletin
No.Â 3,[8] as many copies as we can, both French and German,
and send them out everywhere, including all our groups
abroad. Here too.  

You did not send me the issue of Berner Tagwacht
carrying the resolution of the Bremen people, and you donât send
the paper at all, and I donât get it
here.[9] 

What does Abramovich write about the publication of the French
Internationale FlugblÃ¤tter No.Â 1 in La Chaux-de-Fonds? What
arrangements have been made?  

Salut!
 Lenin 

P.S. Rybalka called on me in Geneva and said that all
the Dzvin
people[10] have gone out for patriotism, which will be dealt with in
No.Â 6 of
Borotba[11] (Have you Nos.Â 1â5?)  Levinsky, on the other hand,
says that Rybalka is simply lying!!??  
 

Send the Lettish
material.[12] What is to be done with it? Shall we publish it, and how?

8/III. 1916 

Dear Comrade, 

Excuse me for not having answered your letter earlier. I have been
lecturing in various towns of Switzerland.  

I thank you very much for your friendly reply. I shall be very pleased
if our collaboration proceeds without any friction.  

Frankly speaking, there was never any question about you and Comrade
Pannekoek being âdecent peopleâ, as you term it. What worried us was the
sudden change in the editorial regulations. Under the first draft
we were given editorial rights (Editorial Board =a union between your group
(you+Trotsky) and the âZimmerwald Leftâ; and in the bureau of
this Left, as you know, we had two votes out of the three: Radekâs,
Zinovievâs and my own). With the change in the draft we lost our editorial
rights a-nd became mere contributors. Of course, we could not challenge
your right to draw up the regulations. But it is only naturalâis it
not?âthat we, as contributors, should nevertheless wish to have certain
guarantees of our rights.  

I trust the matter is now clear and definitely settled.  

Immediately on receipt of your letter I gave orders to the
forwarding office to send you our organ
(Sotsial-Demokratânon-periodical; Nos.Â 33â51 were issued since
the be ginning of the war). Are you receiving it?  

I take this opportunity to discuss important questions relating to our
collaboration.  
 

(1) Our theses (on the right to
 self-determination)[1]

were sent to you by Radek (please forward them on to Gorter too; I am
writing to him about this in detail in connection with his pamphlet). I
consider the Dutch-Polish standpoint to be altogether erroneous
theoretically and a result of the policy of the small states
practically. Cannot our joint struggle against old and new
annexations (what are annexations?) draw us somewhat closer
together? The German, English and Russian standpoint is after all more
important (and objectively more correct) than the Dutch and
Polish! Gorter demands ânational independenceâ for the Dutch East
Indies. Very good! But this is precisely the right to
self-determination!! If Kautsky and the Russian Kautskyites (including
Trotsky) present the question wrongly, this is only another argument
against the Kautskyites! (If you are interested in this question, ask
Gorter to send you my letter. I shall be very pleased to discuss this
question more fully with the Dutch Marxists.)  

(2) The German group Die Internationale. Have you read their
theses in No.Â 3 of Grimmâs
Bulletin?[4] 

In my opinion this is a decisive step to the right after the
first issue of the journal Die Internationale. Not a word against
the Kautskian Centreâand that is the main thing for the German party. Not
a word about the split (Otto RÃ¼hle is quite rightâand they keep silent
about this after his article!!). Not a word about obvious
methods of struggleâabout the illegal organisation, etc.  

And the phrase: âin the era of imperialism there can no longer be
national warsâ! This is theoretically false. Colonial wars are
national wars. (India against Britain, etc.) Thisâpracticallyâis
chauvinism: we representatives of the Great Powers forbid
the oppressed peoples to wage national wars!!  

My conclusion is this: Die Internationale wishes to come
to an agreement with the Kautskyites. These theses cannot be
interpreted in any other way. On top of it all, StrÃ¶bel in Neue Zeit
lauds
Bernstein![5] Zetkin in Gleichheit
  Â  

is against the Zimmerwald Left: diplomatic phrase against
âBolshevik sectarianismâ (!!). A phrase worded so diplomatically that no
one can understand where our âsectarianismâ comes in!! Zetkin
stands for âaurea mediocritasâ between Ledebour and the Zimmerwald
Left. But how this is to be achievedâof this not a word. What is
our mistake?âso far, not a word about it, not a single line in Switzer
land, where there is no censorship.  

How else can you account for it, other than as a desire to come to an
agreement with Kautsky & Co.?  

(3) The âdraftâ (Bulletin No.Â 3) drawn up by you and the
S.D.P. strikes me as being a very bad
one.[6] Not even Radek could defend this draft. Why this curtailment of
the Partyâs Programme? The programme of socialist revolution? Today there
is no need for itâand such a programme lacks a point dealing with the
conquest of political power. In such a programme Â§Â 6 (A) and Â§Â 5
(B) are very odd; Â§Â 6 (B), too, sounds queer: it is precisely in the
event of a socialist revolution that we shall have need of a militia to
defend the new order. We are not pacifists, are we? We cannot
count on a victory simultaneously all over the world (without civil wars?
without wars?)! The colonial programme is absent altogether.  

Only in the event of our being quite sure that we are right on
the threshold of such a revolution shall we need such a
programmeâbut even then it would have to be formulated quite differently.


Today, however, we need something quite different: the labour movement
needs clear views on the necessity of breaking with the social-chauvinists
and Kautskyites, on the illegal organisation, on the means and methods of
mass struggle, etc.  

(4) We shall soon send you our theses to points 5â8 of the agenda of
the second
     conference.[2]

It would be a very good thing if we could come to an agreementâon some of
the points, if not on all of them.  

(5) What are our differences with Trotsky? This must

  Â  

probably interest you. In briefâhe is a Kautskyite, that is, he stands
for unity with the Kautskyites in the Inter national and with Chkheidzeâs
parliamentary group in Russia. We are absolutely against such
unity. Chkheidze with his phrases (that he is for Zimmerwald: see his
recent speech, VorwÃ¤rts 5/III) cloaks the fact that he
shares the views of the Organising Committee and of the people
taking part in the war
   committees.[3]

Trotsky at present is against the Organising Committee (Axelrod and Martov)
but for unity with the Chkheidze Duma group!!  

We are decidedly against.  

With best regards to you, Comrade Pannekoek and the other Dutch
comrades!  

Yours,
 N.Â Lenin 

My address is: Wl.Â Ulianow

 Spiegelgasse. 12.

 Zurich.Â I.  

P.S. Is there any truth in the newspaper reports about the connections
between the New Review (New York) and Vorbote (see
Internationale
Korrespondenz[7] No.Â 69)?  

Donât you think it would be essential to put out No.Â 2 of
Vorbote in March?

I am very glad that arrangements have been made with Grimm.  

I hope he is also publishing the Statement Against the Organising
Committee Secretariat
Abroad.[1] You say nothing about it!  Please answer.  
 

I asked you twice about Sukhanovâs pamphlet, but you
do not answer (whether you sent it to Olga).  

What about Vorbote No.Â 2? When is it coming out? Will there be
criticism of the Internationale resolutions?  

N.B.  ||

If there will, may I see it in the manuscript?  

I have not seen the Junius
yet[2]; couldnât you send it? (Iâll try Platten.)  

What questions havenât I answered? I wrote to Kollontai and
will write again.  

(If you happen to see the MSS. for Vorbote couldnât you send
them here for half a day?)  

Salut,
 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the statement of protest of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. to the
I.S.C. challenging the Organising Committeeâs right to representation at
the Second International Socialist Conference. The statement mentioned the
fact that all organisations in Russia connected with the O.C. approved of
participation in the war industries committees, thereby taking a
âsocial-patriotism standâ.  

The Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, under
the C.C., C.P.S.U., contain a proof-sheet of this statement, which fits the
size of the Sotsial-Demokrat columns. Lenin may have lent a hand
in drafting this protest. On JuneÂ 10, 1916, Sotsial-Demokrat
carried the announcement: âThe C.C.âs statement to the I.S.C. concerning
representation of the O.C. will appear in the next issueâ. The document
was not published at the time.





[2]
This refers to Rosa Luxemburgâs pamphlet Die Krise der Sozial
demokratie, for a criticism of which see Leninâs article âThe Junius
Pamphletâ (present edition, Vol.Â 22, pp. 305â19).

I am sending copy to be set up. I am finishing the article on the
âpeace programmeâ, etc. (for the editorial), and will send it in
      tomorrow.[1]


The I.S.C.âs âAppealâ should be supplemented by a brief
notice of the agenda, the terms of admission,
etc.[2] 

We absolutely cannot disclose the pseudonym of
âSpartacusâ.[3] We absolutely cannot; it would mean helping
Internationale Korrespondenz to reprint it from us: we
would be helping the informers.  

Our âreservationâ, statement (5â8.Â II) we made when voting
for the circular, must be inserted fully and without
fail.  
 

âCrooks of the penâ wonât do. I suggest amendments (pp. 1, 2,
3).[4] This should be written with a minimum of invective, in an
elaborately explanatory way. It would be a good thing to enumerate
the facts, collect the references of the O.C. Secretariat Abroad
(No.Â 2 of the Bulletin). (+No.Â 3 of Izvestia) to
Samara, the Caucasus, Nad, etc., and show that
in Russia all the O.C. people are participants. I strongly advise having
this article rewritten another 2 or 3Â times, and sent to me
again, in order to make it a good and accurate exposition: this is
extremely important.  

Give Self-Defence to Shklovsky, Kasparov & Co. for 2â3
days, then return to me at once.  

I still have no copies (of the German theses on
self-determination). When is this going to end???  

If Radek is holding up No.Â 2 of Vorbote, this is foul
play on his part. We must think over ways of combating this. Should we
not send a collective letter to Roland-Holst? Why not? Why should we stand
on ceremony with him? This is a broken promise, weâll say, itâs bad for the
business, itâs bad faith, itâs an obstacle to the discussion for
the April conference, precisely at the conference!  

Return my theses (on peace, etc.) to me immediately:
I have to redraft them. You had better not show them to Radek
until they have been redrafted.  

Salut!
 Lenin 

Why donât you send me Nash
Golos?[5] I havenât seen it since Martovâs âself-determinationâ
articles. Has the promised answer to him appeared there?  

What about the Bureau of the Zimmerwald Left? Didnât it have
to prepare a report to the April
conference?[6] And the theses?? What about it?

The letter concerns preparation for the press of the article âThe

Spartacus, No.Â 1, the illegal organ of the German revolutionary
Social-Democrats.â  

The next paragraph in the letter mentions the statement made at the
enlarged meeting of the I.S.C. in February 1916 during the discussion of
the appeal âTo All Affiliated Parties and Groupsâ. In voting for the text
of the appeal, the representatives of the Zimmerwald Left declared at the
meeting that although they did not consider it satisfactory on all points,
they were voting for it because they considered it a step forward compared
with the decisions of the First International Socialist Conference in
Zimmerwald.

I am sending the
       theses.[1]


They still have to be correctedâreturn them as soon as
possible.  

We must rush things: when we have finished them, let Zina type
them[2]

in 4â5 copies (will she do it?) for immediate dispatch to France, England,
Sweden, etc.  

Next, they have to be translated immediately into German (perhaps you
will do it and Iâll show them to Kharitonov and then to Platten) (we shall
type them ourselves) and published. The same in French (for the
Italians and French).  

All the Left-wingers and their sympathisers should be able to
see and discuss them a few weeks before the conference. The Dutch too.


Give them to Radek, but for not more than half a day for
copying.  Otherwise I absolutely donât agree!!  

We shall give them to Grimm for publication in
       No.Â 4[3]

of the Bulletin. If he doesnât publish them+the protest (Martov
vs. Chkheidze), he wonât get a
kopek.[4] 

Chkheidzeâs speech has been published. It is reported in
VorwÃ¤rts: for âthe Zimmerwald decision and peace without
annexationsâ. Apparently not a word against
Gvozdyovism[5]!!!  

In the protest Iâll drive this home hard.  

Return the postcards.

The only unconditional demand which the Social-Democrats can put forward as

I had a translation of the Dutch âAnnullierung der
  Staatsschuldenâ.[1]

State debts can be used instead of war debts:
I donât see any great difference.  

How to punish the âconciergesâ? Their share in the total
debt is insignificant, and they could be assigned a
pension from the state treasury (if they served a long time as
concierges).  
 

If you still âhave doubtsâ, donât insert it, or hold up the issue
for a couple of days. I think this Dutch point, as an
exception, is suitable for a âpeace programmeâ (we Could add) as
it contains the only positive demand in connection with the
revolution or the mass struggle (did I insert thisâI donât
remember?)... should be....  

It would be awkward if we inserted it afterwards and there
were no mention of it in the C.O.âs article on this subject. We
had better hold it over for a couple of days and discuss it by letter.


I shall fix things up about the Wiener Arbeiter-Zeitung and
make inquiries about Tyszka (maybe he is in Schriften des Vereins fÃ¼r
Sozial-Politik?).  

Re arrangements with Alexander (he has gone to Norway, where A.Â K. is,
and now we must put the pressure on him as hard as we
can).  

I simply cannot agree to I+II about Kommunist.  

Your arguments are most inconsistent.  

âOnly manoeuvre awayâ?... If so, why risk the business?


âWeâre to blame for getting tied up with an old womanâ...
Of course! But those who are to blame are the first to make amends. What
logic is it to say: I am to blame, therefore I do not
make amends!!!  

I donât consider myself âto blameâ: at that time a bloc was
useful. I made it. Today it is harmful. I shall
be to blame if I donât change it.  

My business reasons you havenât even touched on: squabbles
among the staff (on 3Â points), complaints to the C.Â C.; letters to the
editors; letters to Nashe Slovo (Bronskiâs, perhaps Radekâs, etc.)
ÏÏ= squabbles instead of business.  

And over what? Over the ânameâ?? Itâs ridiculous.  

I have received N.Â I.âs answer to the theses: sheer
piggery, not a single well-thought-out word.  

With Alexander the matter must be put as a point of principle:
after No.Â 1â2 they came out with
âdifferencesâ. Equality (or a place)in the Editorial Board
cannot be grant ed under such differences. It is
inadmissible. N.Â I.âs old waverings on this question (of democracy) should
be collected and it should be demanded that they think every thing over,
digest it, and write giving the reasons for all their differences
for the C.C. (a small pamphlet). Not for

  Â  

publication, but for the C.C. We shall examine it and reject it,
meanwhile on with Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata.[2]

Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata (Sotsial-Demokrat

No.Â 3, which was to contain Leninâs article âA Caricature of Marxism and
Imperialist Economismâ, but owing to lack of funds this collection was not

I have just (8Â p.Â m.) received your postcard. I definitely insist on
the insertion: ârepudiation of state debtsâ.  

Only today I saw an article in Berner Tagwacht standing for
this demand. And not a word there about petty proprietors, concierges,
etc. Why should we worry about them. Simply say: âfor the sake of the
revolution and in connection with itâcancellation of payment on
all state debtsââthat is the only serious blow at finance
capital, the only guarantee of a âdemocratic peaceâ. Unattainable without
a revolution? Certainly. This is no argument against such a point,
but an argument for revolution.  

Certainly. There isnât the shadow of any reason to disagree with the
Dutch and Berner Tagwacht on this score.  

Tomorrow I shall be sending you a long
       letter.[1]


They havenât got Tyszka 1912 here; only 1914
      (LÃ¶hne,[2]

etc.), this can be had in Berne, too, in Schriften des Vereins fur
Sozial-Politik. Band 145.

I am sending an addition (O.Â RÃ¼hle and Liebknecht)âI think it
must be squeezed in, to mark the historical words of
Liebknecht.  

I am sending a draft of cuts covering 37 lines. I trust you will find
where to make more cuts in order to squeeze in RÃ¼hle and
     Liebknecht.[1]


âStrekozaâ in any case must be thrown out, as 1) it is not
the thing; 2) we must wait (since it is not only a matter of Trotsky, but
plus La Vie OuvriÃ¨re: for them it may be
progress).[2] 

3) We had better deal with Trotsky in Sbornik Sotsial
Demokrata; he has to be dealt with at greater length.  

Salut,
 Lenin 

Be sure to send the theses to Grimm personally (it
would be a good idea to invite him for a talk on this).  

I am considering another insertion to the theses. Let me know in
good time when they are made up.  
APPENDIX TO LETTER
Otto RÃ¼hle and Karl Liebknecht

RÃ¼hle in VorwÃ¤rts of 12/I. 1916 openly declared for a
split in the party. Liebknecht, in his speech of 16/III. 1916 in
the Prussian Landtag, openly called on âthose fighting in the trenchesâ
to âlower their rifles and turn against the common enemyâ, for
which he was not allowed to finish his speech. Which Russian
Social-Democrats, then, displayed âfactionalismââthose who stood for
the Bolshevik slogansâthe only consistent slogansâof civil war and a
split with opportunism? Or those who denied the obvious correctness

  Â  

of these slogans, to which the course of events is leading the
internationalists in all countries?

Probably this refers to an article criticising the draft Manifesto for
the Second International Socialist Conference submitted to the I.S.C. on
behalf of persons grouped around the journal La Vie
OuvriÃ¨re and the newspaper Nashe Slovo. The draft was
published on February 29, 1916, in the I.S.C. Bulletin No.Â 3.

Pokrovskyâs proposal should of course be
accepted.[3] I am sitting down to work (the library here is better,
especially in latest economic literature. If it is possible to have the
proof-sheets of the new catalogue for a couple of daysâor at least for
Sundayâtry and get them for me).  

Have Pokrovsky answer me and you officially that the
terms have been accepted (N.Â B. send me his old letters concerning
format and so on); re the deadline let him say no thing (I daresay
I can manage it by V or VI).  

I havenât seen Rakovskyâs speech or the I.S.D. pamphlet on
the 21/XII
minority.[4] Send me both.  

Send me 25 impressions as soon as you can.  

I am sending you the proof-sheets of the
       theses.[1]

Have accepted one of your amendments. Regarding non-member ship of the
party, I absolutely disagree.
1) Reread the preceding text,
2) read Austerlitz and K.Â Kautsky in Neue Zeit (3.III.1916) and
you will see at once that you are wrong. We, the Editorial Board,
must declare outright that we do not consider it compatible with
membership of the partyâonly in this way shall we be drawing a
correct
   Trennungslinie[2]
precisely with the chauvinists, precisely with Martov
(+Plekhanov)+Axelrod & Co., who cannot accept our
formulation.

  Â  

As for Bukharin, he will think it over and accept. A bet?  

Salut,
 Lenin 

N.B. Could you get Chemnitzer Volksstimme for at least 2 days?
Please try!! If you canât, send me its address and the
No. of the issue (containing this article) and the date; I shall
order it.

In your version of the âhistoryâ of âdisagreementsâ there are
factual inaccuracies. For instance, before my departure from Berne, and
not at our last meeting, we discussed this point, and I not only
did not âlet it drift past my earsâ, but answered at length and
repeatedly, and you did not indicate by a single word,
neither then nor a whole month later, that this question was still an open
one to you, that it was in the form of an ultimatum, etc. But, of course,
if you are bent on âsquabblesâ, in one form or another, then you have no
interest in the facts, and I am in no position to prevent you. It is left
for me to choose one of the two alternatives you propose. I choose the
first. Put my signature to it and print (25) impressions as quickly as you
can, for it is extremely difficult to get in touch with the Lefts at such
short notice. Your âprivate statementâ will be printed, of course, not in
the C.O. but in Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata simultaneously with the
publication of the Russian text.  

Salut,
 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

We have just received your postcard, and I hasten to answer it, as the
P.Â O. will soon close. You are not very pleased with the âcrowdâ of
Samovarchikâs
friends,[1] but this young âcrowdâ is in raptures over you:
thatâs what Samovarchik himself writes in their own words. I
congratulate you heartily on the success and wish you still more
of it in future. You are not interested in politics, but you do sympathise
with France: we have excellent information concerning the split
among the German socialists and on how things are going with the
International Socialists of Germany. This news is in favour of
France.  

I wish you again all the very best. I congratulate you on your success
and send my best regardsâso does Olga.  

Yours,
 Lenin 
 

Notes

Apparently this refers to the young French socialists, friends of
G.Â I. Safarov (Samovarchik), who lived in Paris at the time.

Although I know your tendency towards swift âchanges of moodâ and
fretfulness, I never thought it could go to such lengths.... I
never thought you would believe the cock-and-bull story (whose?) about
    Kaltstellung!![1]

I answered all Alexanderâs letters; I wrote him three
times (my 2nd letter must have gone astray in Sweden and the 3rd has
probably not reached him yet). It is absurd to speak about

  Â  

Kaltstellung, when you beg a man to write and he refuses
(not a word about the composition of the âcollegiumâ he has
appointed...) and all he does is either threaten or get angry: âto
Americaâ??? What does this dream mean??  

Not a word about going to Russia, but he finds his tongue to talk about
America?! Naturally, in this mood of his, it would be useful to try and
have it out with him, but that would have been timely if he were going to
Russia. Now, however, the deed is done.  

Did Radek promise you the theses
1) his own on self-determination, and when?
2) His theses of the Leftists were promised for Saturday; today is
Tuesday....  

What is the deadline for the Russian No. of Sotsial-Demokrat,
i.Â e., the one with the article on
Chkhenkeli?[2] 

Salut,
 Lenin

Sotsial-Demokrat No.Â 53 for AprilÂ 13, 1916, carried an article
âChkheidze and His GroupâCatâs-paws of the âGvozdyovâ Partyâ
criticising the chauvinist speeches of Chkheidze and Chkhenkeli in the
Duma. By the âRussianâ number of Sotsial-Demokrat Lenin meant
No.Â 53, which was wholly devoted to events in Russia.

I am sending the theses. Additions, see pp.Â 21 and
22 (they must be inserted in German too).  


I donât agree with you about Alexander. Unless we see eye to eye (you
and me) I shall abstain, and you can re solve by one vote that
âwe have decided to call himâ.  

(1) To show him at the conference would be his undoing. That
is clear. In Sweden and Norway the Russian Government has no sleuths, but
here the place is alive with them. Martov & Co. will tell the world.


I am absolutely against his appearing at the conference. I do not
abstain, I am against.  
 

(2) Alexander himself is demanding a man to be sent to Russia
(I shall write to Ludmila).  

(3) Since Alexander is not going, we should wait a
bit and call him on the eve of his departure. Otherwise it
will all be to no purpose.  

(4) There is no need to hurry, all the more as Alexander will
be influenced by Kievsky; we must bide our time, exchange letters,
etc. (By hastening Alexanderâs arrival you will be hastening his
going over to Bukharin & Co., because Alexander is now all worked
up. But if we wait a bit, the C.Â 0. will come out, correspondence will be
developed with Mme. Kievsky, I shall make up a set of
documents concerning the vacillations of Bukharin & Co. and
Alexander will have time to think and see where Bukharin &
Co. are heading, what mess they are getting themselves into.)  

To send for Alexander now will mean fighting him
now. What for? Over what? If he is not going, we have nothing to
fight over. (We shall receive contacts through conciliator James, etc.)
(James, of course, is to blame.)  

What about Radekâs theses?  

We must wait a bit with the No. on self-determination, if
Vorbote No.Â 2 comes out before the conference. It is
extremely important to squelch Radekâs theses right
away. Radekâs whipping is inevitable, and on his corpore vili we can
âsave a good dealâ of the whipping of the Stockholmers.  

Find out exactly when Kedrov is
going.[1]

Is he still in Berne? Is his wife in Lausanne?  

I advise extreme caution with the Bundist!!! Guardezvous!  

Salut,
 Lenin

it. Ryazanov had promised to write to Kautsky about Dolgolevsky.

It is no use your trying, in your letter, to ignore the main thing, not
daring to deny a fact of which you are only too well aware. Namely, that
the organisation was based (provisionally) on the principle of
federationâthis was reiterated by us in every possible way as
clear as clear can be. Your long speeches do not alter this a whit. And
further, that this

  Â  

principle was abnormal, anti-Party. This, too, was stated. And this is the
crux of the matter.  

Abnormality was tolerable as a temporary measure in the interests of
agreement. After your removal it appears that you came to an agreement, all
three, on the
âthesesâ,[2] for which we can bear no responsibility either directly
or indirectly, not even recognise any proximity to them, leave alone
equality, in our Party.  

If you wish to persist in them and in such an âagreementâ and in
federation, we can only regret it.  

You ask about contributionsâto what journal? Kommunist has
been suspended owing to breach of the temporary agreement. That means to a
new journal? That is, to yours, on the basis of the âthesesâ? We
cannot contribute and shall be compelled to fight it, since we find your
attitude to the Partyâs Programme (Â§Â 9) to be not only wrong and
harmful, but frivolous. Really, during 8Â months of agreement and life
together you three never once drew a pen on this question, which
has a 12âyear history within the Party, never once made a
statement in the Editorial Board of the C.O., never once
attempted to refer back to Party literature, etc.  

Your arguments for a âfreeâ journal (free from the Party Programme?
from the central bodies of the Party?) are just as frivolous, if not
worseâanti-Party.  

If you wish to persist in the theses, we (1) are prepared to publish
them and (2) we are bound to give our opinion:
publish them yourselves (if you do not want us to do it) and furnish them
with a discussion pamphlet in which all three of you could make clear to
the Party your motives.  

P.S. You write that the question of money is âunpleasantâ. Not
always. When money is treated in a true Party manner, it is a pleasant
thing to the Party. When money is used as a weapon against the
Party, it is indeed âunpleasantâ, even worse than unpleasant.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This letter was written in reply to that of Pyatakov, Bosh and Bukharin
to the editors of Sotsial-Demokrat concerning the disagreements on
the Editorial Board of the journal Kommunist.





[2]
This refers to the removal to Christiania (Oslo) of Pyatakov, Bosh and
Bukharin, and to their theses âOn the Slogan of the Right of Nations to
Self-Determinationâ sent in to the editors of Sotsial Demokrat in
November 1915.  

The writers of the âthesesâ were opposed to ClauseÂ 9 of the
R.S.D.L.P. Programme dealing with the right of nations to
self-determination.

Today I sent you a parcel.  

(1) I am sending our theses; whole sentences have been omitted
from them. Please insert them immediately (you have the rough
copy) and return to me at once (for Platten).  

(2) Have you another copy? I am afraid Grimm may let us down. That will
leave us without our theses on the eve of the conference, and at
the conference!!  

(3) I am a bit uncertain whether it is worth while my going to the
conference. There is no mandate (from the Letts) and there probably wonât
be. To attend as a âguestâ would be rather awkward, Iâm afraid; I may be
turned away for all I know (the decision of the 5â8.II.1916 meeting is not
binding on the
conference).[3] 

What does Radek say to this?  

(4) Is Radek âhidingâ FrÃ¶hlich or not? A number of
meetings of the Lefts and formal conferences are needed.  

(5) FrÃ¶hlich and others will be arrested (I assure you) if
they live in Berne. It is our duty to tell FrÃ¶hlich and the others: if
you donât want to be arrested, go to some secluded nook (somewhere
near the conference; Grimm should tell them where it will
be); thatâs the only way to avoid arrest. And a meeting of the
Lefts could be arranged there.  

Talk it over with Radek and FrÃ¶hlich (what about the
Serb?[1]

You say nothing about him) and let me know.  

(6) The Ledebourites, that is the Kautskyites, will probably mess up
the whole conference!! Everyone will be looking at them!!


How many will there be from the I.S.D.?
2(Fr.+....[2]

)?



And from the Internationale?  

(7) We must be prepared to light Martov and Axelrod over the
mandate. Do you undertake to collect material point by point of
No.Â 2 of the Bulletin (from Nash
Golos+Self-Defence+Chkheidzeâs and Chkhenkeliâs speeches and
so on?)? If you do, you must start at once.  
 

(8) A French translation of our theses ought to be made (Inessa will
probably agree), for I donât think Grimm will do it.  

Salut,
Lenin

I am not sending this by express, as it would only waken you, according
to my reckoning, without appreciably saving any time.  

I quite agree with you about inviting the French and promising
50Â frs.  

Advise the Brest people to travel via George: it is important
that he and we should âinterceptâ them first in stead of Grimm (if
possible it would be good to do the same with the
Parisians[2]).  

I havenât had time yet to read-the
indictment.[3] I shanât be long.  

If you like, Iâll send you Sukhanovâs new pamphlet, if you promise me
Junius[1]

(for 1/2 day at least. Get it from Radek, but donât mention
me). Neither Platten nor Nobs have it.  

It would be extremely useful for the cause for Alexander first
to work a little in England. It is dangerous at present to go to
Russia, we shall be ruining a good man (in Sweden as well as in
Russia). Coming here just now is harmful, since he and you will not be able
to restrain yourselves, and we shall only be sullying a valuable
man at the conference. Besides, in a month or two he will be much more

  Â  

useful in Russia, and by that time many important things will be
cleared up and revealed.  

Salut,
 Lenin 

P.S. He will have a ârestâ only by working in England. Inaction will
only wear him out.  


N.B.: P.S. If Grimm does not publish the protest, we must find that out
at once and publish it ourselves, altering the
text.[4] 


P.P.S. Where are the other theses of Radekâs for the Zimmerwald Left
agreement and when shall we have them???

(1) Vorbote obviously will not come out before the
conference. It is necessary immediately to order as many printed
copies of our theses as possible. And quickly too.  

(2) Have you made the insertions in German?  

(3) I donât know what material I have to collect. You
should collect it and write to me what is missing. Otherwise nothing will
come of it.  

(4) Send me the proofs of the protest against Martov.  

(5) I know nothing about the
Scandinavians.[1] Two letters have been sent to Kollontai. There is
little hope after the events in Stockholm.  

(6) My personal finances are not altogether hopeless: whence these
âfalse rumoursâ???  

(7) Did you receive the parcel?  

(8) Will you send the German theses (the corrected copy) which I have
sent you?  
 

(9) I cannot come on Friday. I have a lot of work to do and I am very
late with it.  

Since Radek has no theses and there are no hopes of coming to an
agreement with him (on the question of annexations and the right to
self-determination), the âbureauâ for the time being is
useless. It will be useful in the evening on the 2ndÂ day of the conference,
when the composition will have become clear.  

(10) Canât you give me a more exact address besides the name of the
village you have given
me?[2] 

The collection of material for the war with Martov is very important.


Attend to this carefully and in good time, otherwise we shall
be late in finding the missing material.  

Salut,
Lenin

Radek has no grounds whatever for taking offence, and this should be
explained to him calmly and at length. You should arrange the meeting with
him as quickly as possible (without waiting for me) (in order to reassure
him). You can certainly represent the C.C. at this meeting, as you
generally represent the C.C. in Berne. We have long been
corresponding about your conferring with Radek in regard to the theses.


The situation is what it was before Zimmerwald: we have our own
âresolutionsâ, but we do not reject a Left bloc.  

I shall try to come straight to Kienthal (try to find out the name of
the hotelâthere are only two or three of them there).  
 

Iâm terribly angry at not having received Junius!  

Salut,
Lenin

The S.R.s should be answered with a refusal. âWe can not
advise unity.â Have they given an address for a reply? (Be sure to leave a
copy.)  

I am writing to Alexander, but, of course, not the way you have
âmodifiedâ our arrangement, but the way it was:
(1) the old agreement is cancelled; (2) the Editorial Board of the
C.O. edits in agreement, from issue to issue, with the
publishers; (3) publication in
Berne.[1]


You write the letter to the comrades concerning the conference of

25â29.1V[3]âyou have more material (by the way, please send me our
resolution, the joint one with Radek which he read out at the plenary
meeting: I need it badly).  

Use the same letter perhaps to make a draft appeal for the French (as
discussed with Inessa). I canât get it right.  

Did Meyer & Co. propose voting the
     LeitsÃ¤tze[2]

at the Erweiterten
Kommission?[4] 

I shall go to Lausanne and Geneva to lecture but not on the
conference, so this wonât interfere with
you.[5] 

I agree to a No. of the C.O. on the
conference.[6] Send me distribution of the articles. A paragraph on
Martovâs deceit of the International must go in.  

I did not receive Rybalka.  

Salut,
Lenin 
 

N.B. || 

P.S. Natanson told me that they are considering a rapprochement with
those of their âdefencistsâ who say: first revolution,
then defence. Ask him (in your reply) whether he would care to
inform us about the results of their talks.

16.V.Â 1916 

Dear Alexander, 

The conditions in my
letter[1]

were put forward not for diplomacy and not for bargaining, but as a last
attempt. Since these conditions have not been fully accepted, I consider
that the agreement has not gone through. This is now final. It is no use
talking and writing about this any more. These people confirm my worst
suppositionsâa desire to hide behind Radek, without working on their own,
and to shuffle responsibility off onto me!!  

This is the end!  

Write me more fully about your trip. Isnât there any work
anywhere in Scandinavia? Unbelievable!  

I shall write you at greater length in a day or two. Nadya has written
to the Distributing
Committee[2] many times, and they answered her that everything
has been sent to you.  

We are writing again.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

The circulation of Party documents and Bolshevik literature among the
various groups of the R.S.D.L.P. was taken care of by a special
Distributing Committee of five members in Berne. Inessa Armand was a member
of this Committee for a time. Zinaida Lilina (Zina) was secretary of the
Committee.

It is absolutely essential to send the text itself to
Kamenev again and get his reply, also by letter,
and not merely by
telegraph.[1] The matter is extremely important, the slightest
carelessness is harmful. Better a bit later, but more solidly.


The Kienthal No. cannot be put out without publishing
our Stellungnahme from the Bulletin.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This refers to the draft of a paragraph for Sotsial-Demokrat
written by Zinoviev at the request of Kamenev, who was in exile at the time
in Yeniseisk Gubernia (Siberia). Zinoviev, in this para graph, tried to
condone Kamenevâs behaviour at the trial of the Bolshevik group in the
Duma.

You are 1,000 times wrong about the Japs. Let
them publish separately in their own name. We canât have them
shuffling off the responsibility for this folly upon us: let them
answer for it themselves. I am for a discussion, but not for an
agreement with the Editorial Board of âimperialist Economistsâ,
and I shall have nothing whatever to do with such a journal, as I
have written many a time.  

This must be put an end to. Itâs no use dragging it out. We must
announce Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.  

About the Distributing Committee, there can be no question of having it
transferred here. We have no one here, while in Berne we have Zina+Inessa
(how could you allow her to leave?? Iâm
surprised!!)+Shklovsky+Ilyin+Karpinsky+Kasparov. They must be organised and
none of them allowed to leave.  

I would like very much to get Avanti!, as I see it here only
in the library. I have not seen what you write about.  

We cannot promise Aâder
100â150Â frs.[1] You canât throw promises about and then find you
havenât got the money (âpressure on the groupsâ are mere words). A
six-month trip can only do good, as he wonât be going home

  Â  

before that in any case, and Norway is only a place for scandal.  

The Stellungnahme should be put in, as the Manifesto and all the rest
are all poor. We must show that we said this before more
exactly and fully. This is more important than the
article. How much space do the documents occupy (the
Manifesto+theses+resolution on the
I.S.B.)?[2] Write more precisely.  

I shall send the material in a day or two.  

And so, you have sent Sukhanov? At last you have answered, after
20Â inquiries. I am so surprised at your punctuality that I am writing
specially to Minin about it:
hurray![3] 

Salut,
Lenin 

I have received Demain about the
conference.[4] Have you got it?  


P.S. Minin suggests publishing a collection of decisions of international
congresses.[5] We already have 300 copies (on 70Â pages) up to
1904. Add (paste in) 1904â12 and a preface. To be sold at
50Â centimes. It will pay for itself.  

I am for it. Answer.  
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

A.Â Shlyapnikov having raised the question of going to America for
several months, Zinoviev asked Lenin not to consent to Shlyapnikovâs
departure and to promise to remit 100â150 francs to him monthly in the
course of the next six months.





[2]
This refers to the âProposals of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee to
the Second Socialist Conferenceâ and the decisions adopted at the Kienthal
Conference, namely: the appeal âTo the Peoples Who Are Ruined and
Slaughteredâ, the theses on âThe Attitude of the Proletariat to the
Question of Peaceâ and the resolution âOn the Attitude to the
International Socialist Bureau at The Hagueâ.





[3]
The reference is to an article of Sukhanovâs âOur Left Partiesâ,
which was to have been forwarded to Minin (V.Â A. Karpinsky).





[4]
Reports on the Kienthal Conference were published in No.Â 5. of the
journal Demain which appeared on MayÂ 15, 1916.  Probably Lenin is
referring to the editorial in that issue entitled âZimmerwaldâ from the
pen of Henri Guilbeaux.  

Demainâa journal of the French internationalists, appeared
in Geneva from 1916 to 1918. The last issue, No.Â 31, came out in Moscow in
1919 as the mouthpiece of a group of French Communists.





[5]
A collection of decisions of international congresses of the Second
International was to have been published by the War Prisoners Relief
Committee under the Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. Organisations Abroad. It
was intended for circulation in the P.O.W. camps located in Germany and
Austria-Hungary. The collection was not published.

DearÂ A., 

I received your nervy
letter[2] and hasten to answer you immediately. You have obviously been
fretting a good deal. You have no reason to. Everything has been sent to
you. If you havenât received anything, then one or another censor has not
let it through. Zina assures me that she has sent you everything, and if
she says she has, she has.  

If the censor does not let things through, one must have

  Â  

patience, patience, and persistence. Expect another letter from N.Â K.  

I have read the
material.[3] A lot of splendid stuff. Especially the article on the war
industries committees. Altogether, the collector of this material has done
a splendid jobâmy sincerest greetings to him again and again.  

I have already written to you about the absolute necessity of
terminating all talks with the laps & Co. and I stand by
this. A year (!!) has passed since âthe differencesâ,
and the people have not been thinking, not been working, only hiding behind
othersâ backs and talking scandal. If they still fail to understand that it
is dishonest (to throw the responsibility onto us, for I
am responsible if I form a bloc with an Editorial Board
of muddleheaded views), then they are hopeless. And if they want to
âpublishâ and bear the responsibility themselves, then let them
publish the pamphlet themselves, they have the money; itâs no use hiding
behind others. Let them give an article to the
C.O. themselvesâwe shall put it in!!  

We must think seriously about
Belenin,[4] please think of it, I beg you. The laps are obviously
incapable of doing transport work. Is there anybody else in the
 town[1]

where Belenin recently was? Couldnât be give this job to some foreigner
(they are better than the Russians: more reliable, if slower)? If Belenin
is to go away, it shouldnât be for more than 1/2 year. It would be better
though to find work in Copenhagen: Iâm sure thatâs possible. How much does
Belenin need a month to live on? Answer. Put off all personal
cares and think, in the interests of the cause, how best Belenin can fix
himself up for 1/2 year. Frankly, he will only wear his nerves thin among
the laps. They are shallow, mean people, really! I wish you all the best,
and beg for two words of immediate reply.  

Yours,
 Lenin

[2]
In his letter of MayÂ 13, 1916, Shlyapnikov urgently requested that all
materials on the Kienthal Conference should be sent to him, and expressed
dissatisfaction at the great delays in receiving the
I.S.C. Bulletin, the Swiss newspapers and other necessary
material.





[3]
This refers to the great body of materials which Shlyapnikov collected
during his stay in Russia. Prominent among them were documents relating to
the activities of the war industries committees. Some of them were
published in the Partyâs Central Organâthe newspaper
Sotsial-Demokratâon AprilÂ 13, 1916, under the general heading
âNews from Russiaâ. Shlyapnikovâs article âThe Workers and the War
Industries Committeesâ was published in the same section.





[4]
For reasons of secrecy Lenin calls Shlyapnikov Belenin. This letter
concerns his forthcoming trip to America. Shlyapnikov left for the States
on JuneÂ 25, 1916, and returned to Europe on SeptemberÂ 29 the same year.

I shall send you Demain.  

I insist on
    Stellungnahme.[1]


Re the collection (on international congresses)âI do not agree, as
the Basle resolution, for instance, is missing. That it
will pay for itself, I have no doubt. It will be good both for the
prisoners of war and for Party officials.  


(Zina+
 In.[2]

etc.)



If Inessa has not left the Distributing Committee, it would be absurd to
talk about Berne not being able to handle distribution, simply
absurd. Alexander is furious at not getting anything. He must be sent
it again registered and sent in future registered.  

About the Japs, you are entirely wrong. You donât want to understand
that they are dodging a discussion, throwing the responsibility onto
me and meanly hiding behind Radek. If they want a discussion, let
them publish the pamphlet (and bear the responsibility
themselves!!) or give an article for the C.O.âweâll publish
it! For a year the scoundrels have been hedging, and you vacillate and
indulge them. I shall have nothing to do with their editorial
board or their collection and I repeat my proposal: that we put an end to
this claptrap once for all.  

About âguaranteeing A. for 1/2 yearâ, I shall try to find out how
much money he
       needs.[3]

This canât be decided at a guess. For âtripsâ and 1/2 year living it
wonât be enough; one trip has shown it. Transport went
and will go without him through his agents. And since he is not going home,
it will be more useful for him to go to America for 1/2 year than to sit
doing nothing among idle riffraff and fret him self ill.  
 

Scandal-mongers & Co. would drive even a healthy man to
distraction, and your plans do not serve the cause, they only do harm.


Salut,
 Lenin

Yuriâs letter has made me very pessimisticÂ ... itâs a
swindle.[2] 

I donât agree with your amendments, and so I have decided for the time
being to send my letter to Alexander without
 them[1]

(for in bargaining one must not start small when dealing with such sordid
hucksters).  

Iâm prepared to make concessions only in the discussion and income.


Change of name is essential, as it is of a basically different
character (not what Kommunist wanted to be); besides, there are
vital practical reasons for a change of name.  

Alexander should not be put on the Editorial Board: this would mean
calling everything into question and risking falling out
with A. This is extremely harmful.  

It will work only if we here have the
majority. Otherwise itâs of no use.  

(If Sâil vous plaÃ®t were to remove Yuri, that wouldnât be bad; but I
doubt it.)  

Send me Nash Golos containing the statement of Martov
&Â Co.[3] 

Salut,
 Lenin 
 

Iâm in a hurry. These few lines for the time being.  

No time to go and post it.  

Nadya suggests 2Â editorial boards: an enlarged one and a narrow one
(you and I+Bukharin). But this doesnât work out.

Dear A., 

I am sending you the Japsâ draft. Apparently we wonât get anywhere with
them.  

I answer briefly: 

I absolutely reject what is crossed out.  

I am prepared to make concessions 

(1) in regard to 7 on the Editorial Board, 

(2) 15% quota for the C.C., 

(3) place of publication,



if we agree on the rest, that is: 

(1) 6th and 7th are co-opted by the Editorial Board of the C.O., 

(2) new name for the collection, 

(3) agreement for one collection.  

In regard to transport, etc., I trust you will make up an addendum to
the agreement and insert it (they must definitely contribute towards
transport, and this must definitely be inserted; without it, you
canât work, and I would consider it the height of meanness if capitalists
were to give âtheirâ money without ensuring the chief organiser a
livelihood. This is the height of meanness! Iâll never agree to it!).  

Nadya has answered your questions (I was away lecturing). I hope
everything has been answered. If not, write and let me know!  
 

Be more patient with the kulaks, donât worry more than you need. Itâs
not worth it.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

N.B. Please return this copy of the text of the agreement to me.

Itâs clear that the laps have not yielded an inch. I have
written
       Anâder[1]

that I am prepared to make concessions (1) in regard toÂ 7 (7Â and notÂ 6);
(2) 15%; (3) place of publication, if we agree on the rest, that
is (1) the Editorial Board of the C.O. co-opts both 6th and 7th (otherwise
an obvious swindle; without a majority here on the Editorial Board it is no
use starting); (2) new name for the collection; (3) agreement for
I collection.  

What is crossed out must stay out: neither 2 nor 3 are to be given the
right to decide on a discussion article by a contributor. I insist on this
emphatically.  

I would ask A. to add a Â§ on transport and so on.  

But apparently we wonât get anywhere with this kulak riffraff.

Well, now even Alexander seems to have
realised[3] that we wonât get anywhere with
  Y.[1]

I suggest 

(1) that we decide to issue our collection (Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata); 

(2) that we immediately draw up a list of articles; 

(3) that we invite
  Bukh.+Yur.+A.Â M.[2]

(1) We shall write to Grisha that he should offer the printer to
publish part (or an instalment) of Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata. This would be sensible. We could select for it
articles passable by the censor (from the French point of view). I would
like you to write him about it too.  


Are they preparing a collection of their own?  

(2) No answer should be given to Radekâs question about the
cause of the
       Bruch[1]

with Bukharin and Lyalin. Must agree on it first. Have you a copy of the
C.O. Editorial Boardâs letter (end of 1915 to Bukharin &
Co.)?[3] 

To hide behind Yuri on the question of self-determination is downright
meanness.  
 

(3) Letters from Russia (from the C.C. Bureau) say that Bukharin &
Co. are trying to establish their own contacts with the P.C. over
the head of the
Bureau.[4] Fine fellows, eh? They not only âinformâ Radek, as you
write, but do worse things.  

(4) A reply has come from Neue Zeit: freie
      Exemplare[2]

are forbidden. I shall subscribe for 1/4 year.  

N.B. ||| 

(5) What subjects are you taking for the Russian edition?  

(6) I am waiting for your reply as to exactly how much
material there now is for Sbornik.  

(7) How strange, Grisha and Varin writing about Kommunist and
not Sbornik!  

(8) What is that article âBruderorganâ in Berner Tagwacht.


Please send it!!

[3]
The Editorial Board of Sotsial-Demokrat sent a letter to
Pyatakov, Bosh and Bukharin in the winter of 1915 declaring that they would
not participate in Kommunist as they could not assume Party
responsibility for co-editors who showed an un-Party attitude to the
business.





[4]
Pyatakov and Bosh wrote to the Central Committee Bureau Abroad
demanding that their group be officially recognised as a special group
unsubordinated to the C.C. Bureau Abroad and that it be granted the right
of independent contact with the Russian section of the C.C. and the right
to publish leaflets and other literature. This being refused, they
nevertheless made an attempt to establish contact with the Bureau of the
C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. in Russia over the head of the C.C. Bureau Abroad.

Dear Friend, 

At last I have got hold of Platten: he says itâs hopeless. Guilbeaux
tells Olga (after search attempts) the same thing. Nadya says none
of her passports are any good. All you can do now is write to Olga, etc.,
and look out for a Russian.  

Regarding the German consulate, a Polish woman told Nadya yesterday
that nobody now was allowed passage. Very sad!  

You forgot to send (1) the resolution of the Committee of the
Organisations Abroad concerning the Polish newspaper

  Â  

(Gazeta
   Robotnicza[1]

),

(2) Grishaâs letters on Paris affairs, on Brizonâs

Pierre Brizon, who was a delegate to the Kienthal Conference, made a
declaration on behalf of the three socialist M.P.s. calling upon the deputies to get the government
to conclude an immediate peace without annexations. Together with the two
other socialist deputies Brizon voted against war loans. He concluded his
speech with the words: âWe vote for peace, for France, for socialism!â

I was ever so glad to get your plan of the
collection.[1] You shouldnât grudge the 2,000Â frs., really (it will
bring in some money, and the money will be ours, not the
kulaksâ). Itâs not worth quarreling and upsetting ourselves over such
perfectly lousy people. These people will be wiser after the lesson, I
assure you.  

I quite agree with you that Bukharin (and Yuri) should
formally be asked to immediately give a discussion article on
self-determination. We shall publish it. Will you write to them? Iâm so
furious now with Bukharin that I cannot write. Write at once. To Bukharin
in addition: about HÃ¶glund and the Norwegian strike.  

But we must fix the size as strictly as possible both for
ourselves and for others. Essential!!  

I quite agree also that Radekâs theses should go in.  

I should like to write about self-determinationâon Juniusâand about
defeatism (+âimperialism and opportunismâ+on the Chkheidze Duma group).


We must get Varinâs article immediately. Ought we not get him to write
another one about Ireland? I think we should!  

George and Tinsky (the latter provisionally) should be
commissioned to write something: we must encourage the youth.  
 

On the Internationale preferably 3â4 short articles with a
brief introduction from the
editors.[2] 

Letâs make exact arrangements as to length.  

Best regards!

 Lenin

YuriâG. L. Pyatakovâwrote an article âThe Proletariat and
the Right of Nations to Self-Determination in the Era of Finance Capitalâ,
but owing to its erroneous theses it was not published in the collection.


The Norwegian strike, which started on JuneÂ 6, 1016, was dealt
with in Arvid Hansenâs article âCertain Features of the Contemporary
Labour Movement in Norwayâ published in No.Â 2 of Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata.  

In this letter Lenin refers to his articles âThe Discussion on
Self-Determination Summed Upâ and âThe Junius Pamphletâ, which were
subsequently included in No.Â 1 of Sbornik, and the articles
âImperialism and the Split in Socialismâ and âThe Chkheidze Faction and
Its Roleâ published in No.Â 2.  

Among the articles received by the editors for No.Â 3 of
Sbornik and listed on the cover of No.Â 2 was the article âWhat Is
Happening Among the Troopsâ by Strannik (Varin).





[2]
This refers to articles for Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata
concerning the activities of the Internationale group in
Germany. No.Â 2 of Sbornik carried two articles on this subject:
âIllegal Newspapers of the German Left Oppositionâ and âCurrent Events
of the Revolutionary Struggle in Germanyâ.

Dear Friend, 

Nadyaâs
      passports[1]

are no good at all. (Her health is poor; the weatherâs bad, we canât go to
the mountains.) You ask my advice about Graber. In my opinion, no
arrangements should be made with him (after the way he let us down in
1915[2]) either about the composition of the Editorial Board or
obligatory publication of our articles, as this would mean disgracing
ourselves by acting a comedy. Without long, many-months experience at
contributions (yours or Abramovichâs or bothâregularly, one or another
occasionally) I donât think any serious agreement is worth talking
about. We must look 10 times now âbefore we leapâ.  

The letters to the prisoners of war concerning the questionnaire
did not reach them. I wrote to Malinovsky once, suggesting a
simple programme: place of residence; trade; occupation; age; attitude to
the war, and so on. I got no reply. Obviously the censors donât let it
through! Best regards to Popov from me and Nadya. Will you be able to send
him dried crusts, etc., direct or through somebody?  

All the best!

 Lenin 
 

Notes

This refers to travel documents which Krupskaya had obtained for

[2]
At the beginning of the war Graber adopted an internationalist stand
and attended the Zimmerwald and Kienthal conferences, yet when Vandervelde
arrived in Switzerland in 1915 to campaign for the re-establishment of the
Second International, Graber delivered a message of greetings to him on
behalf of the Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland.

    To Inessa

Dear Friend, 

We shall manage the copying.  

As regards Guilbeaux I donât know what to say. I am not clear about the
plan: who exactly is on the Editorial Board? (Guilbeaux+??) Guilbeaux is
pretty feeble and will spoil everything (Iâm afraid!)....  

What can I have against your article going into the
     collection?[1]

I am all for it.  

All the best.

 Lenin 

P.S. How strange that Radek does not answer you. I canât make it out.


Mind you, he answers Grigory, doesnât he?  
 

Notes
 

[1]
This probably refers to Armandâs article âWho Is Going To Pay For the
War?â The article was not published.âEd.

I am sending you MSS. with slips of notes concerning your article (it
is shockingly lengthy. Im-pos-sible...) and with cuts in Varinâs (he
gave me the right to cut ânon-war passagesâ and generalities. I
think it could do with some more cuts).  

It looks like itâs going to be something measureless. Itâs ghastly. I
donât know what to do. Yet something has still to be written about
opportunism (I have 1/2 of it ready),

  Â  

about defeatism and about Trotskyism (including the Duma
group+P.S.D.).[2] 

Figure out as quickly and accurately as possible how much we
already have.  

I returned to you the Italian cuttings, as far as I remember. If I
didnât, I must have left them in Zurich, and wonât get them until I return.


Re Bukharin & Co., we should send round to the groups (+Radek??) a
confidential letter by the Editorial Board of the C.O. concerning its
refusal (for Bukharin & Co. are obviously âretailingâ already). Or
should we wait a week or so? As for Radek, if he wants to have âourâ
version, let him send you theirs.  

If Ryabovsky is
Stark,[3] then we should wait for Jamesâs reply. For there have
been suspicions both in regard to Stark and Miron. (Myron, as Kamenev
and Malinovsky said, all but confessed to an ugly police affair.)  

Salut!
 Lenin 

P.S. You are right not to trust Bukharin.  

Is the enclosed âtabâ what you
      want?[1]
Return it. 
 

Notes
 

[1]
The meaning of this has not been ascertained.âEd.

 



[2]
The first part of the letter refers to the articles for Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata.  

Opportunism was criticised by Lenin in his article âImperialism and
the Split in Socialismâ; the Duma group and Trotskyism were criticised in
two articles: âEfforts to Whitewash Opportunismâ and âThe Chkheidze
Faction and Its Roleâ, which were published in Sbornik No.Â 2.





[3]
P.Â Ryabovskyâthe pseudonym of L.Â N. Stark. In his letter of
JuneÂ 12, 1916, to Zinoviev, Ryabovsky wrote that a new publishing

 Â  

house, Volna, had been founded in Petrograd and offered him and Lenin to
contribute to the symposiums which it planned to publish.  

It afterwards transpired that the pseudonym âRyabovskyâ was used by
Stark, who was suspected of being an agent provocateur, and Lenin refused
to contribute to these publications.

I am sending you Pod Starym
Znamenem.[3] When you have read it (not> 6Â days), please send
it to the following address: 

Herrn Ussievitsch (bei Frau Frey) Nelkenstr. 21.II.
 Zurich

 (indicating Absender).  

Send me your manuscript (of the book). Iâll read it.  
 

I am writing to
      Pokrovsky.[1]

I have 200 pages. I canât imagine sending it in a
book-binding. Iâm puzzled: 1) specially thin paper? 2) special size? 3)
write on both sides?  

I think the following should be written to Volna: 

1) They should be asked to write everything in detail
(attitude to Priboi, etc.) secretly (by invisible ink in a book) and send
it by hand.  

2) Y.Â Kamenev may
go.[4] 

3) N.Â Sukhanov? We are against (but if it is necessary for
money or other reasons), then it should first be ascertained whether he is
to be allowed as contributor or editor.  

4) Is the Editorial Board wholly ours (as regards orientation) or is it
a coalition? (If the latter, then with whom and exactly how?)  

5) We promise to supply subjects for collections and pamphlets.  

6) About my article on self-determination: I agree to offer it in
pamphlet form (redrafted); please fix an exact date as quickly as
      possible.[2]


Salut!
 Lenin 

Have you the German pamphlet of the 0.Â C. Secretariat Abroad (with
their Kienthal draft and the shamelessly âabbreviatedâ declaration of Dan
&

Co.[5])?  

N.B. || 

I need for my article the issue of Lichtstrahlen which
carried Radekâs article âSelbstbestimmungsrecht der
VÃ¶lkerâ.[6] Could you send it to me or get it for me?

[3]
Pod Starym Znamenem (Under the Old Banner)âa Bolshevik
collection, published in Saratov in 1916 and re-issued in Petrograd in 1917
with slight cuts.





[4]
This refers to Kamenevâs pamphlet The Collapse of the
International, put out by the Volna Publishers.





[5]
This refers to the pamphlet Kriegs und Friedensprobleme der
Arbeiterklasse.  

The Menshevik declaration on the war, published in Russian in the
Bulletin of the R.S.D.L.P. Organising Committee, Secretariat
Abroad (No.Â 5) on JuneÂ 10, 1916, under the heading âThe
St.Â Petersburg and Moscow Mensheviks on the Warâ, was printed in this
pamphlet as an appendix. The pamphlet omitted a fairly large part of the
declaration which appealed for collaboration with the liberal bourgeoisie,
for participation in the war industries committees, and so on.  

Bulletin of the R.S.D.L.P. Organising Committee, Secretariat
Abroadâa Menshevik newspaper, published in Switzerland from February
1915 to March 1917. Ten numbers were put out. The paper adopted a Centrist
stand.





[6]
Radekâs article âThe Right of Nations to Self-Determinationâ
published in the journal Lichtstrahlen No.Â 3 for DecemberÂ 5, 1915,
was criticised by Lenin in his article âThe Discussion on
Self-Determination Summed Upâ (see present edition, Vol.Â 22, pp. 349â50).

24/V11. 1916 

Dear M.Â N., 

G.Â Z. writes me that you received my letter, but not the manuscript
(that is, you do not mention it in your letter). It was sent to you
simultaneously with a registered letter on JulyÂ 2, by registered
book-post. If you have not received it, what is to be done? I donât suppose
you can make inquiries. I can do so through the post office, but it will
take an awfully long time. Copy it again? (Maybe in duplicate, sending one
copy via Sweden, would be more reliable?) There is nothing in it
the censor could object to, and I canât make out why and how this could
happen. Write to me, please, immediately or wire.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 V.Â Ulyanov

About the telegram from
      Yeniseisk[1]

âit

is necessary to get a reply by letter. It is impossible to print by guess
work. We must get a letter.  

I am not sure whether itâs worth while publishing the statement (on the
Grimm affair). But if we publish it now, the text should be changed to a
sharper tone.  

I am sending you the German pamphlet of the 0.Â C. Return it.  

I am sending my article. Figure out exactly how much material
you now have altogether. We must decide about the

  Â  

rest. (If Yuri sends his in, we shall have to answer him too, worse luck.)


Safarovâs article is unsuitable. I think he should be ad vised to
rewrite it in a legal vein (this is not at all difficult)
for Letopis or for Volna. Wouldnât it be better to have this done verbally,
if you will be seeing him soon?  

How are things to be sent to Volna? Simply direct to their address?
Registered book-post? Has a new pseudonym been arranged with them?  

Send me the legal pamphlets of Plekhanov and
Potresov.[2] 

In regard to Neue Zeit I have written to the forwarding
office.  
 

Notes

This may possibly refer to Plekhanovâs pamphlet Internationalism

of International Democratic Socialism published in Petrograd in 1916.

Dear Friend, 

We are sending back the letters of
Grisha[1] and the French. The latter shows, to my great satisfaction,
that you have had a great influence on the French and have left enduring
marks.  

As regards Guilbeaux, we shall await events; since âno one invited him
to be editorâ, how did he get thereâby crashing the gate?  

We shall wait for Graberâs reply to you and for your explanations!


Your plan for arranging a French paper for us (!?), apart
from Sentinelle (!?), is anything but clear to me.... Hâm,
hâm....  

Get Georgeâs article and mine on self-determination and on Junius from
Grigory (if you have not already done so).  

I wish you all the best and beg you to take a cure, so that
you may be quite fit by winter. Go south, to the sunshine!!  
 

Have you got La Feuille, Ce quâil faut dire, The
Call?[2] I can send them.  

Salut,
 Lenin

I am sending you Engelsâs
article.[3] There is no need to return it for the time being.


I am sending an article on the Junius
      pamphlet.[1]

I am finishing the self-determination
      article.[2]


Could you write something for the collection about the meeting of the
German and Austrian social-chauvinists? (the minutes that you sent me).


I think a short report is needed.  

Why donât you write: 

1) About Bukharin (and about your letter to him)?  

2) Ditto about Varin.  

3) Did you send Pod Starym Znamenem to Usiyevich? (Send me
a list of the articles for our collection.)  

4) About Voprosy Strakhovaniya.  

5) About the Volna collections. Should I write (and what?) or wait?


Have you got Berner Tagwacht? I havenât. Could you send me
cuttings (Grimmâs resignation and so on and so
forth)?[4] 

Salut,

[4]
This refers to Grimmâs statement published in Berner Tagwacht
No.Â 173 for JulyÂ 26, 1916, in which he criticised Plattenâs resolution
adopted at a party meeting in Zurich on JulyÂ 24, 1916, following a
discussion of the activities of the Social-Democratic parliamentary
group. The resolution condemned the reformist activities both of the
Right-wing parliamentary group and of the Centre, beaded by Grimm, and
contained criticism of the measures being taken by the Bundesrat, which
might lead to an infraction of Swiss neutrality. Grimm did not attend the
meeting. On reading the resolution he declared his disagreement with its
various points and his intention of âlaying down his mandate to the
partyâ. Grimm asked for his statement to be discussed so that he could
hand in his resignation at the next union meeting.

The July (seventh) issue of the journal Demain carried an
article by Guilbeaux âGuerre Ã  la guerreâ.

I have received the manuscript.  

I am sending Neue Zeit+2 Austr. books (I shall ask for them
again, but later on: will let you know).  

We have written to
James.[1]
[2]


As regards writing for the legal collection, Iâm afraid I wonât manage
it.  

Send me a list of the articles for our Sbornik.  

You canât invite Guilbeaux to contribute: heâs a wind bag; we may
disgrace ourselves. We had better wait.  

Did you send Usiyevich Pod Starym Znamenem?  

Fru Alexandra Kollontay.  

Turisthotel. Holmenkollen.  

Kristiania. 

Did you send a formal letter to Bukharin offering him
to publish a discussion
article?[3] It is absolutely necessary to send him a formal letter and
keep a copy (send it to me). A polite letter, of course, saying
that we are replying to Radekâs theses in any case (to hint that he can
wait until this discussion is over if he wants).  

Have you a set of Nashe Slovo?  

Since Konferenz has been substituted for Kriegs-Parteitagâthis smacks
of a semi-deal with the Kautskyites.  

What is this about your being unwell? You must go to

  Â  

Sahli without fail and strictly carry out doctorâs
orders! Show this to Zina.  

Salut!
 Lenin 
 

Notes
 

[1]
Anna Yelizarova-Ulyanova.âEd.  
 



[2]
This refers to the letter to Anna Ulyanova-Yelizarova asking for
information about the Volna Publishers and about the identity of
P.Â Ryabovsky, who had offered Lenin and Zinoviev to contribute to the
symposiums put out by this publishing house =

(see NoteÂ 478).





[3]
Bukharin wrote an article âA Contribution to the Theory of the
Imperialist Stateâ for Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata, but owing to
its fallacious anti-Marxist propositions on the question of the state and
the dictatorship of the proletariat the article was rejected by the
Editorial Board.  

No.Â 1 of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata carried Radekâs âTheses on
Imperialism and National Oppressionâ published in the journal
Vorbote in April 1916 over the signature of the editors of
Gazeta Robotnicza. Leninâs article âThe Discussion on
Self-Determination Summed Upâ published in Sbornik directly after
Radekâs theses was a reply to them.

Dear Friend, 

Regarding the 30 frs.âI am for trying it (not >Â 3 Nos.,
not more than 100Â frs.), but I should like to see their sheet first; either
have them send a set or let Abramovich give us fuller information.  

We must go about this more carefully, we must be extremely careful
(without mentioning whose, who, no names), as we disgrace ourselves
hideously by starting a thing (a leap in the dark), then dropping it.  

We disgrace ourselves im-pos-sib-ly!  

Salutations amicales,

 Yours,

 Lenin

I am sending the statement. Itâs a pity you did not send Radekâs
letter. I am still in the dark about the âdefenceâ of Grimm! (And you
didnât send all the cuttings.)

 

The address to which you sent books to Pokrovskyâplease, let me have
it immediately.

 ||| N.B.


I have finished the article on self-determination; it runs into
79Â pages 

+ âImperialism and the Split in Socialismâ, which I am writing.  

+ âDisarmament or the Arming of the People?â (which I have written in
German). About 25Â pages.  

Where will it go in? Whatâs to be done? Where are the proofs?  

I shall write about the Russian collection in a day or two.  

I havenât got Neue Zeit myself.  

Salut!

Dear M.Â N., 

I received both your postcards. Thanks very much. The terribly sad news
about the loss of the MS. has compelled the author of the work written in
the Plekhanov vein to resort to the G.Â Z.
method[1] (ah, those Germans!  Itâs they who are to blame for the loss!
I wish the French beat them!).  

The author hopes you will try to save the five sheets, otherwise it
will be a loss of time, labour and oneness, and a good deal more. Sincere
regards.  

Yours,
 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin refers in this manner to his book Imperialism, the Highest
Stage of Capitalism for reasons of secrecy. The âG.Â Z. methodâ means
sending the manuscript pasted inside the cover of a French book.

Dear Editor, 

I am so scared by the ridiculous and incredible loss of an
absolutely innocuous manuscript that I am afraid even to mention
your name.  

I am afraid that my letter, too, has been copied. I asked there, that
if it was inconvenient to take the usual pseudonym (V.Â Ilyin), to use
N.Â Lenivtsyn. Now we shall have to use another: V.Â I. Ivanovsky, let us
say.  

I advised there (if the word âimperialismâ is so âhorrifyingâ) to
change the title, sag, to: âThe Peculiarities of Contemporary
Capitalismâ.  

Now this will have to be changed again: âLatest Economic Data on
Modern Capitalismâ or something like that.  

The titles (chapter headings) to be deleted (when sent to
Russia). Perhaps even the chapter headings should be changed? It could be
done.  

I would ask you to keep the present format (which is what I was asked
to do). No cuts can be made without breaking it up.  

(Unless we throw out whole chapters at the end? So that I can use them
in another place? This at the very worst of worsts! I am all for no cuts.)


Please leave the notes, they are important (especially
       No.Â 101[1]

),

and the literature too should be indicated, for in Russia you have
students and suchlike people who read.  

Your editorial changes and improvements, of course, I shall accept with
pleasure.  

My best regards,

 Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

Nadya is giving you a secret meeting place, password and ways of
communicating with us for
Marcu.[2] 

Let him ask a French- or German-speaking person to come to Petrograd
(through the secret address) and tell him in greatest possible
detail all the foreign news about the movement of the Lefts,
about Vorbote No.Â 1 and No.Â 2, about our
disputes on disarmament (I am sending my
       article[1]

;

show it to himâincidentally, write me where Nobs is), about the
German
Arbeiterpolitik,[3] about the arrests in Germany, about
Longuet and the Longuetists in France, about the arrest of Maclean in
England, and generally all about the movement of the Lefts and
internationalists in Europe and America in greater detail?  

Then let him offer his services (there, in Petrograd) to call on the
way at Moscow, Kiev, Odessa (where he is travelling) for the same purpose
and for passing on the address for letters to us.  

Teach him (thoroughly) to write with invisible ink and to
maintain the strictest secrecy in Russia: he must act the
part of a soldier who is going to Rumania to fight, and stick to that!


We donât know yet when we shall be back. Probably not before a
fortnight.  

Greetings,
 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

Notes
 

[1]
Nobs will correct the language himself.  âLenin
 



[2]
This refers to Valeriu Marcu, a Rumanian Social-Democrat who lived in
Switzerland during the war. In 1916 he went to Paris, Moscow and Rumania on
Leninâs errand.





[3]
Arbeiterpolitikâa weekly devoted to questions of scientific
socialism, organ of the Bremen group of Left Radicals headed by Johann
Knief and Paul FrÃ¶hlich. The group joined the Communist Party of Germany
in 1919. The journal was published in Bremen from 1916 to 1919.  

After the October Revolution the journal devoted considerable space to
information about life in Soviet Russia.

I suggest sending Yuri the following
       answer.[1]


(He makes his point, I suppose, at the end of Â§Â 2: ânot to be
usedâ. If he wants us not to criticise his article now in the press, he is
right.  

But afterwards? If their faction builds up and a struggle develops?


If he wants us not to make a copy of his article or show it to members
of the Party, we cannot agree to this.  

We shall not conceal anything from members of the Party.)


I think the answer I propose will suffice for the time being. Let him
make himself look ridiculous.  

We must have his article in order to show it to Alexander, the Bureau
and so on. This is essential.  

I approve of your letter to Bukharin. I suggest (not in the
form of an ultimatum) an
addition.[2] I think it best for the time being to send the letter only
in your own name:
it is not so official and, considering the tone, more convenient. We shall
discuss it; it is not so urgent as the reply to Yuri (had we not better get
Yuriâs answer first, before sending your letter to Bukharin?).  

Salut,
 Lenin 

P. S. If you do not need the maps of all the war theatres in
Le Temps and The Daily Telegraph, please cut them out and
send them to me.

[2]
This refers to the draft letter to Bukharin written by Zinoviev
criticising the position of Bosh and Pyatakov during the talks concerning
resumption of publication of the journal Kommunist.  

To the words in Zinovievâs hand: â...we wish to work with you despite
our disagreements...â Lenin added: âwhich you apparently treat more
carefully, partly perhaps because you have been writing more on economic
than on political questions.â

Dear Comrade, 

You demand for yourself very strange privileges in the Party. It is
unheard-of and, given any sort of Party attitude towards the matter,
unthinkable that contributors should dictate terms making the contribution
of articles contingent upon the editors inviting third persons, at the
choice of the contributor, or âguaranteeingâ that the Editorial Boardâs
reply (to an article it does not know of!) will be recognised by the
contributor as a âcomradelyâ one and so on.  

In the interests of the business, however, we consider it advisable, by
way of exception, to accede to your ultimatum, namely: 

on Point 1âwe invite the comrade named by
 you[1]

or anybody else you may desire, who belongs to our Party; 

on Point 2âall contributors are always guaranteed publication of
their articles without alteration, if they so desire, or return of the
articles. Your wish here is not a privilege, but a gratuitous demand; 

on Point 3âall we can do is to send you the reply of the Editorial
Board (or of any other contributor) to your article and leave it to you to
decide whether you want both articles published or not.  

With Social-Democratic greetings

Lecoin is no good at all. Canât go in.  

Broutchoux[3] is a stupid anarchist; he can only be published
with a note from the editors. (I shall write it in the proofs.)


Womenâs movement (?)âsend the MS. Iâm afraid it will have to be held
over through lack of space.  

I am sending imperialism and
     disarmament.[1]

Return the latter immediately. It must go into the Berne
collection without fail, as it will never be passed by the censor and is
very urgent (the Young and others have made an appalling muddle here).


If you want us to discuss the differences you point out, send me your
article again as quickly as possible and mark off exactly what you disagree
with.  

The phrases about the âepochâ have become empty phrasesâRadek and
others have shown this. Did the âepochâ of 1789â1871 exclude
non-national wars?  

To talk about âdefence of the fatherlandâ in general is
theoretically absurd. For defence of the fatherland =war in
general. Thatâs the crux of the matter.  

Junius[2]

cannot be referred to Paris, as this article is inseparably linked
with both self-determination and disarmament.  

Write what precisely is being set up.  

P.S. I am sending Neue Zeit and The Call for Inessa.


Salut!
 Lenin

the collection.  

By the Berne collection Lenin meant No.Â 1 of Sbornik
Sotsial Demokrata which was being set up in Berne. No.Â 2 was to be set
up in Paris. The article âThe Junius Pamphletâ was included in the first
issue. The article of Zinovievâs to which Lenin refers is âThe Second

Social-Democratic piece of writing. And your âmottoesâ are no good
besides). (Mottoes, if needed, should be different.)  

2) I have started to write âabout Kautskyismâ for Russian
collections.[3] I have already written you this.  

3) I shall try and sit down soon to write a reply to
Yuri.[4] 

4) 1,500 copies of the collections will be enough.  

5) Re the 2ndÂ collection, I am against deciding right
away. Grishaâs letter is not clear: 500 frs.+paper? Am writing
him. Letâs wait for his reply. The devil take him!! He isnât clear
about it!!  

6) Put in Safâchik on the Duma group (as the item on the
prisoners of war is already set up and will go
   inde).[1]


7) Re the article on the womenâs movement, I have already
written you about my doubts (send in
       deÂ Ms,[2]

there is little space). Instead of answering, you write:
âcommissionedâ, although you know that I did not commission it!! This is
an omission. If an article isnât written, one should first let one
know the subject, plan and details, before advising to write it.  

8) Re the national question, I would very much like to
republish self-determination with an addition. Would
Volna undertake it? Did you write to them about it?  

9) The Gnevich
collection??[5] In Polish or Russian?? You must find this out and also
who else is writing and on what subject?? This must be made
clear. What have you written him?  

Best regards,

 Lenin 
 

10) I propose the enclosed translation from De Tribune for
inclusion in
Sbornik.[6]

[3]
Lenin intended to have the article on Kautskyism published in the
symposium Pod Starym Znamenem, but its publication was
discontinued after the appearance of the first issue. The Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism have a plan of the article
headed by Lenin, âOn Kautskyismâ (see Lenin Miscellany XXX,
pp.Â 133â34). A special work on Kautsky was written by Lenin in 1918 (see
âThe Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautskyâ, present edition,
Vol.Â 28. pp.Â 227â325).





[4]
This refers to Leninâs article âReply to P.Â Kievsky (Y.Â Pyatakov)â
(see present edition, Vol.Â 23, pp.Â 22â27).  

Points 4â7 refer to Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata. PointÂ 5 refers
to Belenkyâs proposal that the second issue of Sbornik should be
published in Paris. Safarovâs articles were not published in the
collections. The article about the womenâs movement was that by Zinaida
Lilina.





[5]
Gnevichâpseudonym of Fabierkiewicz, a leader of the Polish
labour movement, who was in Petrograd at the time. Two issues of the
journal Zycie (Life) in the Polish language were published in 1916
with his co-operation.





[6]

No.Â 2 of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata carried an article by
Henriette Roland-Holst âAmbiguous Positionâ, which was a translation of
an article published in the newspaper De Tribune on AugustÂ 22,
1918.

Dear Comrade, 

We may possibly take advantage of the trip, but we must first think it
over and find out to what extent he is trust worthy generally and also as
regards orderliness and secrecy techniques. To ask Grimm is rather
awkward. Let me know your opinion and whether you can
find out anything about him in Zurich (discreetly). I can send you the
pamphlet on imperialism. I have no idea about the âmeetingâ
(Gr.+Radek+??). Find out everything you can in greatest detail and let me
know.  

I shall send you the article for
 Volksrecht,[1]

too, as soon as I hear that Nobs is back in Zurich. Nobs wrote me that he
had gone away for
   Ferien[2]

not far from me and wanted to let me know, but fell silent. I
donât know where he is. Do you?  

I am sending Ausland-Politik containing Semkovskyâs article.


Were there articles of Radekâs against
    Entwaffnung[3]

in Volksrecht? If there were, could you send them to me? Who told
you that I was to be in Zurich on Sunday?? This is most piquant,
who could say such a thing!!  

Could you obtain in Zurich the Polish and Bundist War saw newspapers
containing information (detailed information by districts) about the
elections in Warsaw?  It is very

  Â  

interesting! I wrote Bronski, but he is silent. All the best, and my
regards to your wife and your little girl.  

Yours,
 Lenin 

P.S. You have not answered Nadyaâs request about Neues
Leben. If you are too busy, couldnât Usiyevich find out? Or is he
particularly busy these days?

Dear M.Â N., 

I agree to your proposals. I am terribly depressed, though, at the
thought of the end being cut. Couldnât the end in that case be printed in
the journal without alteration? And with a note from the editors to the
effect that these are deductions and conclusions from the pamphlet? It
would be a great pity to fragmentise it!! A great pity!! If you
can do something, I shall be very much obliged. I shall write about this
myself, but my letter takes a long time and wonât get there before several
months, if it gets there at all.  

My best regards,

 Yours,

 Ulyanov 

P.S. I heard say that Potresov has joined the staff of the publishing
house!! And the famous
       novelist[1]

has agreed!! What a shame, what a crying shame, eh?

1) On the question of the âcommissionedâ article, you are wrong in
trying to exonerate yourself. You couldnât help noticing that I was
extra-careful to avoid any sharply worded expression of displeasure in my
first letter (which you have not answered).  

I wrote nothing about bad faith: omission, too, is a mild, and not
harsh expression, which includes simple forgetfulness and inattentiveness,
and these are far removed from bad faith, Why this exaggeration, this talk
about âbad faithâ?  

Where, in my own hand, have I written about 5Â pages? Send it to me, if
you are not yet persuaded that you were wrong.  

2) About
Franz,[2] we quite agree with you (both Nadya and myself): it seems
worse at first than afterwards.  

3) I am sending you two draft of a letter to
N.Â I.[1]

I shall not object to making it more polite: send corrections and
additions, if you consider them
necessary.[3] 

Best regards,

 Lenin

I have just read the Swedish and Norwegian articles.  

They cannot be separated. They should go in together and
cannot go in without our own article against disarmament. It
changes our plans.  

I shall sit down and write (rewrite) this article for Sbornik,
which will necessarily have to be increased within these

  Â  

limits, and the rest cut down as much as possible. What nonsense,
this disarmament, yet itâs beginning to get some people muddled in our
Party too!  

N.B. ||| 

P.S. Since the question of the Paris collection has not yet been settled,
we should hold up Strannikâs article, for if we have to
choose, it should certainly be Alexanderâs.

This is Nadyaâs draft of the
cuts.[2] 

I read the article a second time (I read it once before). I am
definitely against any cuts. It means spoiling the article. An integral
summarising article (with minor details, mentioning the participant or
interlocutor) is extremely important.  

Honestly, this article cannot be cut.  

Whatâs to be done?  

As a matter of fact, we can seriously âunloadâ only by holding over
your article. Reasons: 

1) It is written not for this collection.  

2) It is part of a book, for the publication of which we already have
an agreement; the chances of its being published, therefore, are
real. Double publication is a luxury we can ill afford.  

3) The main and important things about the history of the International
have already been said by you in your article in Sotsial-Demokrat.


4) The collection must be limited (Î±) to Russian
material+(Î²) to highlights of the controversy, to vexed and mooted
questions of the Party.  

5) And defeatismâwhere does that come in?  

Write and tell me candidly what you think of this

  Â  

proposition: from a businesslike editorial point of view (specifically) or
from the point of view of grievance.  


{{ 
But our disputes and efforts towards agreement must continue
in any case.

}}



A 160âpage collection, according to my plan,
would give rich, extremely valuable Russian material+a discussion
on self-determination (without
 Yuri[1]

)

 + defeatism+Trotsky,

 +about the Interna- tional

(Chkheidze),

 that is, everything that brooks no delay.  

Cost about 2,500 frs. +400 to Ludmila (=ditto transport) +about 500 for
transport =nearly 3,400. We can just about manage that, and no
more.  

I agree to put out a No. of the C.O. (+another 100â200 frs.).

 

Notes
 

[1]
As this will mean having to write a reply to
Yuri[3] and sending it to him!!  âLenin
 



[2]
This letter of Leninâs is prefaced by a plan of the cuts, written in
Krupskayaâs hand, to Zinovievâs article âThe Second Inter national and the
Problem of the Warâ which was intended for Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata (it was published in No.Â 2).  

PointÂ 5 of Leninâs letter refers to Zinovievâs article
â\thinspaceâDefeatismâ Before and Nowâ (printed in the first issue of the
collection).  

Lower down Lenin lists his articles for the collection: âThe
Discussion on Self-Determination Summed Upâ, âImperialism and the Split
in Socialismâ, âEfforts to Whitewash Opportunismâ and âThe Chkheidze
Faction and Its Roleâ.





[3]
In August 1916 G.Â L. Pyatakov (Yuri) sent in his article âThe
Proletariat and the âRight of Nations to Self-Determinationâ in the Era of
Finance Capitalâ for Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata. This article and
Leninâs reply to it were to have been published in No.Â 3 of the collection,
which did not come out at the time owing to lack of funds.  

Lenin replied to Pyatakovâs article in his articles âReply to
P.Â Kievsky (Y.Â Pyatakov)â and âA Caricature of Marxism and Imperialist
Economismâ (see present edition, Vol.Â 23, pp.Â 22â27 and 28â76).

Well, now youâve said it!! I couldnât help smiling, really. Youâve
written yourself into âcourtâ.... In fact, any court in every case would
find that to label a proposal to hold over an article as âuncomradelyâ,
would make collegiate work impossible.  

Luckily for you there is no âcourtâ, otherwise you would certainly be
âconvictedâ.  

We still have to âcut downâ though. We have bulged out of the
former plan of the collection (Russian material +the discussion on
self-determination). Find out exactly and officially from Benteli what the
cost of a sheet is. We

  Â  

shall then calculate exactly how much we can print (for
nobody prints anything free of chargeâremember that!).

There is no conflict: you are imagining too much, really. Recollect (or
reread) my letter: I did not state that I was voting against your
article, I only wrote: âwrite and tell me candidlyâ what you think of
such-and-such a
plan.[1]

You wrote.  

And thatâs all.  

So the article is going in.  

Yuri will âreconcileâ us still more,
IÂ believe,[2] as it is precisely his conclusion that âin the
epoch of imperialismâ there can be no âdefence of the
fatherlandâ.  

|| 
In fact, âin an imperialist war, engendered by the epoch of
imperialism, defence of the fatherland is a deceptionâ.  
 

These are âtwo great differencesâ.  

Best regards,

 Lenin 

P.S. Isnât it time we sent a joint letter to N.Â I.Â B. about the
faction? I think it is. And about his article?  

I am for issuing the C.O. I agree!

Leninâs ironical comment stresses the error of and certain uniformity

âdefenceâ of the fatherland (see Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata
No.Â 2, December 1916, p.Â 27).

1) I am sending you Roland-Holst. I think she ought not to be published
either.  

2) Reply to
      Bukharin.[1]

I agree to your changes, but one thing should be added, namely:
that the main thing for us is the articleâs shortcomings
on points of principle.

 || 

Otherwise it looks as if we are hedging.  

If you agree to this insertion, then send the letter (working it in
logically).  

If not, we shall discuss it once more.  

3) I canât find the sheet you refer to as having my mark there
expressing my agreement to have the article commissioned. This is a mistake
on your

4) Franz has left an article. In my opinion a very good and
brief one. I am for putting it in. I shall send it to you.  

5) There is no need to hurry with the Paris collection. Letâs
calculate exactly what can go in (5Â sheets at 50,000=250,000
printerâs ems altogether).  
  Â  

6) I am writing the reply to Yuri. This is a long job, though.


Best regards,

 Lenin

1) I am sending Georgeâs leaflet-article. In my opinion itâs very
poor. I donât think itâs even worth rewriting.... Vulgar, unreasoned,
stilted, and âfolksyâ. An example of how not to write popular
things....  

Perhaps you will talk to him when meeting?  

2) About disarmament, I am not quite sure. If we put the
Swede+Norwegian in the collection, then we must include an article
on disarmament. It wonât take me long to write, a few alterations to my
article.[1] But will there be space for it?  

We must decide. Answer.  

Let us figure out again how much our collection will bulgeâitâs
bulging enough as it is.  

3) Reply to Bukharin. Must decide this too. If you do not wish to say
that the main thing is differences on points of principle, then I
agree to change it, giving two reasons (for non-publication):

 (Î±) technical and financial

 (Î²) on points of principle.  

Send me such a variant (donât forget to connect both parts of
the letter in good literary style) and let us decide the matter quickly. Of
course, bear in mind that our reply to Bukharin is of great
significance: it has to be well considered, and a copy must be kept.  

4) We must decide about the Paris collection: make-up and size?  
 

If 2,000 5âsheet copies (=10,000 sheets) cost 500Â frs., then 1,500
copies (itâs all we need) could be issued in 6Â 2/3 sheets


    x50,000
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
330 thous. ems.


Probably less than 330 thous., round about 300 thous.?  

Is that right?  

N.B. || 

We must also find out whether they take illegal stuff too in Paris?  That
is, do they print secretly?  

This is most important! Yet there is no full reply from
Grisha!!!  

When this is all cleared up, let us draw up a list of copy for Paris.


(I donât think we need count Yuriâs article and the reply to him, since
1) the reply has not yet been written;
2) we donât know whether His Merchant Majesty will give his consent to the
printing.)  

5) I shall sit down to Radekâs
theses[2] (look through them): I havenât read them yet in the proofs.


6) I am returning Strannikâs
additions[3] What are we going to do about him??  

Best regards,

 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
By the article on disarmament Lenin meant âThe Military Programme of
the Proletarian Revolutionâ, which he had written in German and slightly
revised for Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata, where it was published in
No.Â 2 under the heading âThe âDisarmamentâ Sloganâ.





[2]
A reference to âTheses on Imperialism and National Oppressionâ
published in the journal Vorbote over the signature Gazeta
Robotnicza and reprinted in the first issue of Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata.





[3]
This probably refers to the article by Strannik (V.Â Y. Fridolin),
âWhat Is Happening Among the Troopsâ, which was listed among the copy
received by the editors for No.Â 3 of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.

Dear Friend, 

I am sending you the manuscript. Please return it, also
registered: it is the only copy (and I shall be needing it again
rather urgently).  
 

I shall send you the article on disarmament in a day or two, I havenât
got it just now. We have started to make the acquaintance of the young
here, and regret very much that we have no complete knowledge of any one
language. Here is where you have interesting and fruitful work!
Organisation of the youth is growing throughout Switzerland. All the very
best to you.

We have written to Bukharin.  

I am sending you an article; it should go to Berne too, as Paris is
silent.  

We must calculate more exactly (you have both the MSS. and proofs)
how much there is for Berne.  

Naturally, I canât be âpleasedâ with your keeping my articles so long
in pickle. Send them immediately to the printing shop: you hurried me with
them, saying the compositor was hurrying you!!  

And where are our
       theses?[1]

Where are the proofs of them?  

The question of Sotsial-Demokrat is a difficult one, as I
am afraid this will hold up Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata!!  

When you have returned
   âDisarmamentâ[2]

I shall think it over finally. We shall weigh more carefully what
can go in there, how long it will hold up Sbornik.  

I am not writing anything so far for
 Voprosy.[3]

But for

  Â  

the collection (Pod Starym Znamenem) I want to write about
Kautskyism[4] (incidentally, return the pamphlet on imperialism as
soon as possible: I need it for quoting).  

Salut!

Dear Friend, 

Nadya has written in such
detail,[2] that I have nothing to add. I wish you all the best,
congratulate you on your success in America and ask YOU to keep closer in
touch by letter. If Belenin wants to go there, he must be thrice
more careful (the danger is great) and thoroughly plan his trips for
establishing contacts. These are lacking. And where is A.Â M.? Best
regards.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Leninâs note and Krupskayaâs letter to Shlyapnikov were in reply to the
latterâs first letter written upon his return to Europe from America (he
returned to Copenhagen on SeptemberÂ 29). In his letter Shlyapnikov gave an
account of the work he had done in America and wrote that he was planning
to go to Russia. In view of this Lenin, for reasons of secrecy, refers to
Shlyapnikov as âBel.â in his note.

I am sending your
article.[2] Now thatâs felicitous! Should we not add two things?  

(1.) that the Germans have their defeatists, of whom history

  Â  

will have its say (remember Segerâs story and Bloch); 

(2) about the shabby trick played on us by Gazeta Robotnicza
in regard to defeatism.  

As regards the I.S.B., I think it better to wait for an invitation!


I see Avanti! but I donât follow it closely. Couldnât George
give the exact No. and date?  

(Wasnât that the meeting of parliamentarians, of which, if I
am not mistaken, there was talk at Kienthal?)  

The parliamentarians are all Kautskyites, you know.  

Since Alexander has already been set upâwe are in a bit of a
dilemma. Whatâs to be done?  

I just canât cut Strannik! I have read it twice!! I canât read
it any more.  

I shall send you my reply to Yuri in a day or
 two.[1]


Should not more explicit arrangements be made with Paris first?  

Wonât it be a fiasco if we start sending and wonât be
able to keep it up regularly?  

I am as mad as the devil with Grisha for his unpunctuality and
imprecision: I canât make sense out of his letters! Sends silly telegrams!


In Zurich thereâs absolutely nobody to do the copying.  

Best regards,

 Lenin 

There should be a secret letter from Grisha one of these days? Isnât
that so?

PointÂ 2 of Leninâs letter refers to the publication in Gazeta

of defeat of the tsarist monarchy which the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. put
forward at the beginning of the war, on the grounds that it put âan
argument into the hands of the German social-patriotsâ.

14.X. 1916 

Dear N.Â I., 

As regards the âill-fatedâ article, as you call it, you argue very
strangely, really, or rather you donât argue at all, but get excited and
skip your arguments. Now just look, reallyâfrom a distanceâwhat you
make of it: 

â... I simply have a feeling (!) that it is not a matter (!) of points
of accusation (!), but âgenerallyâ...â.  

This is what you write, word for word!! How can one argue like this? It
amounts to stopping the mouth of every person who wants to argue and
discuss. The Editorial Boardâs letter gives precise indications
and formulations of the differences, but you work yourself up: feeling,
accusation, generally....  

You read a lecture âon the same subjectâ, and none of the
O.C. writers âso much as mentioned anarchismâ.  

But againâis that an argument? There is nothing about anarchism in
the Editorial Boardâs letter either. What exactly you said at the lecture
cannot be established. That the O.C. writers are foolishâis a fact. But
you add:
âI gave it to them hot on other pointsâ....  

âOpportunism is fear of what the liquidationist-yellow Maria
Alexeyevna[4] [Potresov] will say.â  

Pretty strong. Yes. But itâs wide of the mark! For I maintain that
Potresov here is right against
Bazarov.[5] 

(1) Is this correct or not? You do not go into it.â(2) Is it a bad
thing for the yellows to be right against the errors of our
people? You disposed of the issue by the use of strong language. It works
out that it is you who âfearâ to give thought to the significance of
Potresovâs being right against Bazarov!  

â...You cannot impute to me denial of the struggle for democracy....â
I impute to you a number of mistakes on this question and point out exactly
which. But you avoid the issue.  

You formulate three âstatementsâ, alleged to be âabsolutely
indisputable and orthodoxically Marxistâ, to which the first chapter
âcould be reducedâ.  
 

But these statements (1) are so general that they are still a long way
off from concreteness; (2nd and most important of all) it is not
what the article says!!  

âNeither Gr. nor you even attempt to tell me where the heresy is.â


Pardon me, this is untrue. This is stated most precisely in
the Editorial Boardâs letter, but you do not answer the things we
said and pointed out. Not a sound in reply to any of our
numerous and precise remarks!!  

One of our remarks: you break off quotations from Marx and Engels
in a way that misrenders the sense or makes for inexact
conclusions. You answer only on this point, and how do you answer? That âI
know the continuation (of the quotations) perfectly wellâ. âBut on the
points in question they had views which are not liable to
misinterpretation.â  

And thatâs that!! It would be funny were it not so
sad. âMisinterpretationâ is just what we write about precisely;
without examining a single argument or producing a single
quotation (I compared them purposely; I did not write you for
nothing; I compared more than one quotation!), you dismiss the
matter: ânot liable to misinterpretationâ. The blame rests fully upon
youâinstead of a discussion of differences, you wave the matter away.


No one accused you either of âheresyâ or of âanarchismâ in this
connection, but we wrote: âlet it matureâ. These are âtwo big
differencesâ. You not only do not answer our remarks, but you read a
different meaning into them. You canât do that!  

âThe article has been lying a long time....â Now this is backdated
cavilling. We corresponded with Gr. on this for a
long time, as we had other articles to attend to. You had not fixed any
dates yet, and no one could know of your possible departure. This is just
cavilling.  

As for âchucking outâ and polemic in a non-break tone, I must say
that I have not yet entered into polemic with you in the press,
but exchanged letters with you before any polemic and in order
to avoid it. Thatâs a fact. Facts are stubborn
     things.[1]

You canât beat facts by gossip. My answer

  Â  

to P.Â Kievsky is for the press (not to you, but to P.Â Kievsky) and we grant
him a privilege we have never granted anyone before: we
send the article to him first for his âagreementâ. (Unfortunately, the
copyist fell ill in the middle of the work: that is why we havenât got the
article yet, and you probably wonât see it before your departure; but
we have the mail with America, and P.Â Kievsky will probably
forward it on to you. We cannot take it from, this copyist and give it to
another, because he is in a different town; we have no other one in view;
he is hard up, and we can not deprive him of even these tiny
earnings promised him beforehand.)  

P.Â Kievskyâs article is very bad and heâs hopelessly muddled (generally
on the question of
     democracy).[2]


That we always thought highly of you and spent months, many months,
corresponding in detail and pointing out since the spring of 1915
that on the question of a minimum programme and democracy you were
vacillatingâyou are aware. I would sincerely be pleased if we had a
polemic only with P.Â Kievsky, who started it, and if our
differences with you were ironed out. To achieve this, however, it is
necessary that you should go into the questions at issue carefully and
attentively, and not wave them away.  

I am very, very pleased that we both see eye to eye against
âdisarmamentâ. I was also very glad to make the acquaintance of Franz: he
must have had some good work done on him in the way of Bolshevik
propaganda; no small credit for this is probably due to you. The man tries
to go deep into things and promises well.  

I am enclosing the certificate. Correspondence with America can be
conducted only through Scandinavia: otherwise everything
gets lost; the French censorship is brazen.  

Regarding America. I wrote a number of letters there in 1915:
all were confiscated by the accursed French and British censors.

 

I would very much like 

(1) To have the manifesto of the Zimmerwald Left published there in
English.  

(2) Dittoâour pamphlet on the war (revised for the new edition).


(3) To arrange, if possible, for the most important publications and
pamphlets of the Socialist Party and the Socialist Labour Party (I have
only the Appeal to Reason) to be sent gratis to the C.C.


(4) Cahan, editor of a Jewish New York newspaper, visited me
in Cracow in 1912 and promised me, among other things, to send publications
of official economic statistics of the United States (these publications
are given out to newspaper offices free of charge there), saying that his
paper had such a huge forwarding office that this would be no trouble. He
did not keep his promise. If you meet him, put out feelers as to whether it
is hopeless or not.  

(5) It would be a good thing to form a small group of Russian
Bolsheviks and Lettish Bolsheviks capable of following interesting
literature, sending it, writing about it, translating and printing
what we send from here, and in general discussing together and âpushingâ
all kinds of questions about the III International and about the âLeftâ
in the international socialist movement.  

If a couple of Bolsheviks were actively linked with a couple of Letts
possessing a good knowledge of English, then the thing might work.  

(6) Generally, give special attention to the Letts. Try in particular
to see Berzin. He can probably be traced through Strahdneks.  

(7) At the end of 1914 or in 1915 I received from America a leaflet of
the Socialist Propaganda League with a profession de foi in the
spirit of the Zimmerwald Left. I am enclosing their address. I sent
them a long letter in English. Probably went astray? I shall try
and find the copy and send it to you, if you think it worth while on
inquiry. I also wrote to the Letts about the League through Strahdneks:
must have gone astray too.  

(8) There should be a base in America for work against the
English bourgeoisie, which has carried the censorship to crazy
lengths. This to Â§Â 5.  
 

(9) Try and answer us without delay, if only by a couple of lines in a
postcard, so that we can make an attempt to establish proper
contact with America; and give us notice (1â1Â 1/2, months)
beforehand of the date of your return.

(Cf. Mrs. Grundy).





[5]
The journal Letopis No.Â 5 for May 1916 published an article by
V.Â Bazarov, âThe Present Situation and Perspectivesâ, giving an analysis
of the economic crisis in Russia caused by the imperialist war. In this
article Bazarov called the division of the Partyâs Programme into minimum
and maximum an âanachronismâ and stated that the struggle for democratic
reforms was needless.  


Potresov in his article âNotes of a Publicistâ, published in August
1916 in No.Â 1 of the Menshevik journal Dyelo, wrote that
âMaximalist optimismâ (this was how he characterised Bazarov s views)
which does away with âall immediate tasks of democracyâ âis the greatest
enemy of the democratic movement, its best and most reliable
disorganiserâ.  

It is probably this statement in Potresovâs article that Lenin has in
view.

Dear Friend, 

We received the pamphlet on imperialism and your long letter. Received
everything. Thanks very much. We shall send you The Call. Grigory
will probably send something new from Berne. Nadya is busy with the League
congress; she sends her regards. Yesterday she sent you a long
letter. Donât sit in SÃ¶renberg, youâll freeze and catch a cold.


All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. Maybe you have no money for your fare? Mind you let us know: we
can easily get what you need....

Dear Friend, 

I sent you Letopis No.Â 7
yesterday.[1] When you have done with it, return it or forward it to
Berne to be returned from there without jail and without it going
any further. Abramovich was here and we talked quite a lot. The chap

  Â  

is working very well from below, independently of Huber,
âagreementsâ with whom, of course, are worthless. If you sent me
occasionally any interesting Nos. of lâHumanitÃ©
containing criticism of the âminoritairesâ, etc., I would be much
obliged.  

Friendly greetings,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

I intend to address the congress of the Swiss party (on Saturday 4.XI)
with a message of
      greetings.[1]

I am enclosing the text. Will you please translate it into
       French[2]

;

in the event of your not being able to make out my scribble, I have copied
out two of the most slovenly passages (p.Â 4).  

If, for any reason, you cannot do this, please wire
(UljanowâKammererâSpiegelgasse. 14).  

If you can, please answer at once by postcard confirming
receipt of this letter and saying when you will finish it and when
you will send the translation, so that I get it by Friday, as I am afraid
to be late: time is short and the mail service with SÃ¶renberg is poor.


I have copied out the translations of the quotations from the pamphlet,
but they should be inserted in the connect ed French text of the
speech.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

Thank you very much for the translation. I did not have a chance to
read it; I spoke at the very beginning of the congress, when the French
delegates had not yet arrived and no French translations were being made. I
shall nevertheless try to make use of the translation. I shall send it to
Abramovich, etc., and we shall try to get it published somewhere.  

I missed the post today: the P.O. closed at 7Â p.m., and I was engaged
at the congress.  

The congress impressed me favourably. For the first time during the
war, not only a Left emerged at the Swiss

  Â  

congress (in 1914 it did not exist at all, and in 1915 it only began to
take shape) but it started to build up into an opposition to both
the Rights and the Centre (Grimm). No little credit for this is due to
Radek; previously, in the summer, he had got things mixed up a bit, for
Grigory wrote me positively that Radek had written him boasting that he had
âreconciled Grimm with Plattenâ (a fine service!). But Bronski is
following a line that is three times more vacillating and three times more
foolish than Radekâs.  

Radek arrived and we âmade it upâ (relations had been strained to the
verge of a break). On the eve of the congress we managed to arrange a
private meeting of the Left delegates (which I had been urging for three
weeks, but unsuccessfully until then!). This meeting was attended by
all the Left leaders, the Young
      included.[1]

Radek and I easily carried through a resolution of ours, acting in concert
and agreeing to acceptable concessions. At the congress the struggle has
already begun. The first fight was over an appraisal of the Nationalrat
group. The Lefts attacked. The speeches of Name and Platten were
splendid. Greulichâs defence of the Right was extremely feeble. Grimm
played at Centre again and by aid of âlittle amendmentsâ obtained a
unanimous vote (spoiling the game a bit). He saw that the majority was
obviously on the side of Platten. Tomorrow there should be a fight on the
question of Kienthal; we have taken a hand here in drafting a Left
resolution; it is much better than the one of Nat.-rat. We shall see what
will come of it! Iâm like an old war horse in battle.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

Instead of âimperialist economismâ, you write that, you donât
understand the expression âeconomic imperialismâ.  

The old âeconomismâ wrongly posed the question of the attitude of
capitalism to the political struggle.  

The new âeconomismâ wrongly poses the question of the attitude of
capitalist imperialism to the political struggle.  

I am writing about this at greater length in my article against Yuri
(this âmerchantâ has âconsentedâ to being publishedâthat means, he
will go into Sbornik No.Â 3 or No.Â 4).  

The differences with Radek are of more than mere theoretical
interest for Russia (as well as for Germany, Britain, for
countries with colonies). For Switzerlandâyes.  

Grimm is an insolent beggar and a swine: he meanly attacks, not me (as
Grigory mistakenly believes, being poorly informed by Zina), but
Radek. It was like this (entre nous): Friday evening we arranged a
meeting of the Lefts (where Radek and I acted fully in concert) and
adopted. (setting up a committee) a resolution on Kienthal. It was attended
by Platten, Nobs, MÃ¼nzenberg and some others, i.e., all the
leaders of the Lefts. On Saturday afternoon, when the congress was
on (it started Saturday morning), a meeting of the âYoungâ (and also
congress delegates) was held outside the congress
premises. MÃ¼nzenberg was in the chair. The report on (our)
resolution was made by Radek. I did not speak. The resolution was
adopted. To this meeting (the door not being locked!)  some ladies
came uninvitedâ(Genossin Block (Bloch), a lady friend of Grimmâs
and a gossip), Dimka (another gossip and a lady friend of Martovâs) and
others. Obviously, they âreported backâ to Grimm. And Grimm decided
(believing this old wivesâ silly tittle-tattle) that the âactual
moverâ=Radek, and wrote in the press that this mover (Urheber) spoke âVor
einem anderen
Forumâ.[3] Kharitonov is publishing a refutation in
Volksrecht.  

I carried on strong agitation with Platten and Nobs for

  Â  

organising (or rather, rallying) the
Lefts.[1]

I am making a report to them on this (Platten has
promised to arrange it). I wonder whether Iâll cope with the
language and whether anything will come of it.  

Radek has promised to come out directly against Grimm
in
Arbeiterpolitik[4] (I advise you to subscribe to this weekly
journal, it costs 15Â pfg.=20 cent.).  

Weâll see whether he does!  

Keep well.  

(It was me who wrote the article in the
C.O.[2]

)



All the best,

 Lenin 

P.S. I sent, my âthesesâ to Berne for you (to Grigoryâs address)
asking you to translate them into French (for Geneva, Lausanne, La
Chaux-de-Fonds, etc.). Did you receive them? Whatâs your opinion of them?

 

Notes
 

[1]
On NovemberÂ 20 and 30, 1916, Lenin had talks with Left Zimmerwaldists
on the theses âTasks of the Left Zimmerwaldists in the Swiss
Social-Democratic Partyâ.âEd.  

[2]
What article this refers to has not been established.âEd.

 



[3]
This refers to the editorial âThe Party Congressâ published in
Berner Tagwacht on NovemberÂ 7, 1916. The part of the article in
which a very brief account was given of the discussion at the congress of
the question of the attitude to the Kienthal Conference, contained
malicious hints about an unknown mover of the draft resolution and claimed
that the signatures under this draft were invalid.  

On NovemberÂ 8, 1916, the newspaper Volksrecht No.Â 262
published a statement by Ernst Nobs who wrote that be âfully shares the
viewsâ set forth in the draft resolution moved by the Left
Social-Democrats.





[4]
A critical article against Grimm was published as an editorial in
Arbeiterpolitik on DecemberÂ 2, 1916, under the beading âAfter the
Party Congress of the Swiss Social-Democratsâ over the signature of Arnold
Struthahn.

Dear Friend, 

Entre nousâprivately!âI donât advise you to send such a
letter.[1] You can talk with such straightforwardness only
with absolutely reliable and absolutely friendly Left wingers.


Where are they? Who are they?  

âWe wish to take into our handsââwhy, this will get into the press
and you will be made a laughingstock!!  

My advice: you can write like this only to absolute friends
(through Radek, for instance, if he undertakes

  Â  

on his responsibility to send it to friends and to no one else).


For the S.D. public at large, it should be redrafted with the
greatest care.  

Best regards,

 Lenin 
 

Notes

This refers to the draft of a letter to âA Woman Social-Democrat of
Germanyâ (probably Clara Zetkin) in which Armand, on be half of the
editors of the journal Rabotnitsa, invited an exchange of views on
questions relating to the womenâs labour movement and suggested calling an
unofficial conference of Left women socialists.  

The words quoted by Lenin are from the following text of Armandâs
letter: âIt seems to us that during the war this movement (i.e., the
womenâs movement.âEd.) could play a very important role for
socialism. When most of the proletariatâthe menâare at the fronts, the
other part of the proletariatâthe womenâshould take our socialist cause
into their own hands.â

Dear Friend, 

About the book by Delaisi, I regret to say that I havenât got it. I
must have left it in Berne, or else somebody has âappropriatedâ it.  

About your letter to the women, you have taken offence at my remarks,
havenât you? And even stretched their meaning just a wee bit?  

I wrote that I would advise deleting the passage which says âwe wish
to take into our handsâ as it would look absurd. If you do not
agree to deleting it, then I advise sending it only to
closest and most reliable friends in Germany, for example, through
Radek.  

Should you agree to alter the unguarded expressions (the letter, in
view of the present postal systems, arrests in Germany and France, etc.,
may get into other hands), then my advice simply falls away. That
was what my advice amounted to. That, and nothing more. Not the
slightest âdispleasureâ at your letter, none whatever.


You asked my opinion; I gave it to you and merely suggested
only slight alterations.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

I think it desirable to have the following logical construction of the
resolution (based on Plattenâs
resolution[1]) (the phrase in brackets is from Platten word for
word): 

1. âThe present world war is an imperialist war.â  

2. (âThe criminal policy of peaceâ), namely, of Switzerland, which
may also become involved in the imperialist war, on the one hand
as a result of this policy, on the other owing to the imperialist
environment.  

3. Therefore, âdefence of the fatherlandâ is a âhypocritical
phraseâ for Switzerland too.  

4. Rejection in principle of defence of the fatherland, and âthe
strongest methods of proletarian class struggleâ. A fullest possible list
of these methods.  

Immediate demobilisation.  

5. âThe complete destruction of militarismâ not in the
pacifist sense, but in close bearing on the socialist revolution and as a
result of it.  

In my opinion, this may give us a good five-point resolution.  

It goes without saying that I give no formulations here, and merely
point out logical sequence and train of thought.  

With sincere greetings,

 Lenin 
 

Notes

This refers to Plattenâs draft resolution on the war issue, writ ten
with a view to the emergency congress of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party,
at which the question of the attitude towards the war was to be discussed.

6/XII.1916 

Dear Mikh. Nik., 

I received your postcard and two hundred francs, which I have forwarded
to Zinoviev (I received 869Â frs.=500 rubles

  Â  

from Petrograd), i.e., apparently the whole fee; unless part of it
is payment for the agrarian
work.[1]

It is very, very sad that intrigants are working next to the
      âbossâ[2]

of the publications against publications!!...  

My sincere regards,

 V.Â Ulyanov

Dear Friend, 

I have just received your postcard. I sent a postcard to you in Berne,
poste restante, a very short one containing a single request for your
response, as your silence began to worry me a bit.  

I am very keen now on the idea of publishing leaflets on Swiss affairs.


Something in the nature of a circle of Left-wingers has formed
here. This term is inaccurate, though: so far just a number of meetings
(evoked by my theses). Attended by Nobs, Platten, MÃ¼nzenberg and several
others of the Young. We discuss the war resolution in connection with the
tasks of the Lefts. These talks have brought home to me most clearly:
1) how devilishly weak (in all respects) the Swiss Lefts are;
2) how poor is the âsystemâ of influence of Bronski and Radek, who have
been writing articles about the Lefts in other countries! The
whole point is that everyone is willingly Left when it comes to foreign
countries: itâs cheap!! But when it comes to Switzerland... nothing
doing!  
 

Abramovich promises to distribute 1,500 copies of pamphlets and
leaflets (will you undertake to translate them? Systematically and
regularly?  Answer!), while MÃ¼nzenberg, with whom I spoke yesterday, the
head of the organisation of the Young with 4,000!! German
members, undertakes to distribute a maximum of 1,500!!  

Guilbeaux, to whom I sent the
       theses,[1]

writes that he is very pleased with them and will use them as a
basis for his newly formed Committee of Internationalists. We
shall see!  

I have read Humbert-Drozâs
Plaidoirie!![2] My God, what muddle in his head! And this in
1916! A hopeless Tolstoyan, Iâm afraid.  

Grigory writes me that in No.Â 25 of Arbeiterpolitik there is a
paragraph on âThree Editors of
Kommunistâ[3] and that âRadek is taking the same line with
Y.Â B.+Bukharin as Tyszka with Lyovaâ.... At last Grigory too has come to
see it, although he still hangs back on the grounds that âdespite this we
ought not to break with Radekâ. Ha, ha!  

I wonder how you are fixed up. Itâs a cold flat, Maison Vincent, isnât
it?  Do you go skiing? I strongly recommend itâitâs very good for the
health. Go skiing in the mountains near Rocher de Naye.  

My best regards,

 Lenin 

P.S. What sort of person is Usiyevichâs wife? An energetic woman, I
believe? Will he make a Bolshevik of her or she make a
neither-this-nor-that of him?

The newspaper Arbeiterpolitik No.Â 25 for DecemberÂ 9, 1916,
published in its âOur Political Diaryâ section an unsigned paragraph
dated DecemberÂ 6, 1916. Touching on the discussion of the question of the
right of nations to self-determination in the pages of No.Â 1 of Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata, the writer stated that Leninâs views on this
question were not shared by âthree members of the Editorial Board of
Kommunist, a theoretical review of Russian Left radicalsâ. Such a
report could only disorientate the reader, as it did not mention a word
either about the theoretical mistakes or the anti-Party factional behaviour
of this group after the appearance of Kommunist.  

The same issue of Arbeiterpolitik carried as an editorial a
short article by Bukharin entitled âThe Imperialist Stateâ with a
footnote from the editors commenting favourably on his article.

Regarding Kommunist, itâs not worth arguing any more, seeing
that you deny the fact that they insisted to the last on equality
and refused to make any change in the Editorial Board. You canât
get away from the facts:
(1) equality; (2) Tyszka im
    Hintergrunde.[2]


I sent the 200 frs.  

The Shklovsky scandal makes me furious and worries
me.[3] And you wanted to hand all the funds over to him!! Energetic
action is called for: he should be told that the money is needed by the New
Year, and you should keep at him until he returns it all! What a damned
scandal! A real âfinancial swindleâ, and right under our noses.  

I agree to your plan for a collective letter to
Arbeiterpolitik.  

Best regards,

 Lenin 

P.S.


What about the letter to Paris?

 Hasnât Inessa sent it yet?

Dear M.Â N., 

I received your postcard and thank you very much for the trouble you
have taken to save my pamphlet. Really, you are mistaken in thinking that I
blame you in any way. Not at all! I am sure that without your intervention
it would have been much worse, as the
      publisher[1]

evidently gives an ear to âoutsideâ advice from the philistine camp. It
canât be helped. One good thingâyou have succeeded nevertheless in saving
some part of it (and a fairly large part). All the best wishes for a happy
New Year.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Iâd like to share with you my ideas concerning the following plan.


I have set going my theses on the tasks of the Swiss Lefts, both in
German and in French. In this connection I have hit on the plan of founding
a small publishing business and issuing sheets, leaflets and small
pamphlets elaborating these theses.  
 

I wrote to Abramovich. He answers that he undertakes to distribute
1,500 copies. He has credit in Imprimerie co-opÃ©rative for six months. A
leaflet will cost 50â70Â frs. He promises to find out the details and let
me know (I asked for details as to the cost of 2, 4 and 8Â pages for 2,000
and 5,000 copies; the cost of the matrices; and how soon they can be
issued). But so far I have heard nothing from him!  

Told Abramovich in reply that the plan would have to be abandoned
for the time being owing to difficulties, of which more below. I
was compelled, or rather impelled, to answer in this way by the fact that
Abramovich appears to be in the blues or something: he sometimes doesnât
answer for weeks!! Heâs not used to carrying on correspondence, if
you please, and is in the blues!! You canât work like this.  

To rely solely on Abramovich in this business seemed to me rather
risky.  

Further. I wrote to Guilbeauxâhe answered: the theses are
âexcellentâ. Very well: will you help distribute the leaflets!? How many
copies?  

No reply to this day! (Obviously, because of the plan for
their own little journal.)  

I went to MÃ¼nzenberg: will you help? I will. But we canât handle more
than 1,500 (this is terribly little!!)âwe are overloaded with
literature!  

I have no German translator. Nobs half-promised, but obviously
wonât do it.  

Whatâs more, the party (i.e., the Parteivorstand) is deciding only
tomorrow (7.I) whether to postpone the congress or not. A lot depends on
this, of course.  

Such is the state of affairs that produced my âbold planâ and then
its abandonment (for a time).  

Would you care to tackle this business?  

Tentatively and approximately in the following manner: 

You will be publisher of the French pamphlets. I take upon myself the
editing (writing and editing). You will also be the translator. You would
go to La Chaux-de-Fonds (for a short time, for a few days; I donât think
there would be any need to live there) and ascertain the financial and
technical details. You would also find out whether you could raise money
(or get an advance) for this publishing business (how much?âI donât
know. I think from 100Â frs. to several
  Â  

hundred, up to 300â500 frs. depending on the answer of the
printing shop and on what scale the business is contemplated).  

You could visit several centres of French Switzerland (La
Chaux-de-Fonds, Fribourg, GenÃ¨ve, Lausanne, Bern, Neuch&ahattel and
so onâthis list is given only as an example) forming
distributing groups, reading lectures, etc., making contacts and
arrangements, checking.  

I repeat: this is a tentative plan of work at its widest scope
(probably only part of it would be practicable). A French publishing
business might get the Germans moving.  

I donât think Abramovich is lyingâhe will distribute 1,500. We can
add a minimum of 500 for Geneva, etc. Total=2,000. We could make
matrix-moulds so as not to risk losing money on a large number. The youth
leagues to be paid 20% for distribution.  

(a) Will it pay? (b) And how long will it take for the money to come
back?  

Everything depends on these two questions (a+b).


If
(a) it does not pay at all, then we should not start it, for we have no
donors. We can only go in for what can pay for itself. If
(b) the money takes a long time in turning over, i.e. (this is most
important), if the pamphlets are not paid for punctually and regularly,
then the business either cannot be started altogether or
else a large sum must be assigned to put several leaflets
into circulation (there may always be need for issuing a polemical reply,
as our enemies will not keep silent; the enemies have newspapers; to answer
them we should have the possibility of issuing an extra pamphlet or
leaflet).



[[ The situation in the Party is such that a furious struggle may
flare up. ]] 

These are the advantages and disadvantages, the bright prospects and
difficulties.  

If this idea generally does not interest you, or if, for one reason or
another, you do not consider it possible or suitable for you to undertake
and organise this publishing business, then please drop the thing
without ceremony. This will remain just a talk of mine with you on
the subject of one of my plans (until I am eventually able, perhaps, to
find a chance of resuming my plans).  

If you are interested, then go and see Abramovich, go

  Â  

into all this in a businesslike manner and drop me a line at once giving
the results. We shall then discuss the plan again together most thoroughly
and exchange letters.  

The leaflets, in my opinion, should be of two kinds:
(Î±Î±) for the masses and (Î²Î²) for socialists.  

Both of them small: from 2 to 8 printed pages of small size
(small close-set type).  

Subjects (tentatively): 

(Î±Î±)âagainst defence of the fatherland; against indirect
taxation; high cost of living; introduction of socialism as an immediate
aim; expropriation of the banks, etc.  

(Î²Î²)âpoor and sound arguments for rejecting defence of the
fatherland; against the social-patriots and the Centre; against the
GrÃ¼tlianer[1] people outside and inside the party, etc., etc.


How to prepare for the party congress; a bourgeois-reformist labour
party or a socialist party?  

The leaflets could all be under a single trade name, Svet, say, or any
other name.  

MÃ¼nzenberg told me that they (the âYoungâ) would distribute even
without commission charges, but that, I think, is impossible. At 20%
(1Â c. per every 5Â c. of sales price) they would probably distribute
energetically.  

I hope I have made this all clear to you now, that is, I have written
everything I know (as regards plans and information) to help you form an
opinion of the whole enterprise.  

I would consider it extremely important to publish the same
things in German and Italian. But for that we need (1) translators;
(2) more money. So far we have neither. I think that if the French job
started, the Germans would find translators, maybe.  

Possibly, the thing may not work with us simply because we may not be
able to take the right tone as far as the French mentalitÃ© is concerned!


This worries me greatly and scares me very much.

GrÃ¼tlianerâa newspaper, organ of the Swiss
bourgeois-reformist GrÃ¼tli-Verein; founded in Zurich in 1851. During the
imperialist world war (1914â18) the paper adopted a social-chauvinist
stand. Lenin described, it as a newspaper of âthe consistent and avowed
servants of the bourgeoisie in the labour movementâ.

Dear Friend, 

Thanks awfully for the news from Geneva. I wrote a very excited letter
to Olga, which Karpinsky called abusive. Iâm afraid she took offence. I
shall write her an apology.  

It has been hard to bear the fact that Brilliant has won Guilbeaux away
from us.  

But I see from your letter that this was unavoidable:
given Guilbeauxâs weakness, we could not, of course, make head
against the joint influences of Lunacharsky (poet!)+ Brilliant (he has
money, Grigory writes me)+Naine+Graber.  

We shall wait and see what sort of organ they will have.  

If you get lâHumanitÃ© and have no further need of it after
reading, please send me cuttings (the text of congress
resolutions; articles on the congress; the speeches of Longuet & Co.;
their resolutions; interesting articles, which are
generally rare. And so
on).[1] 

On what a shameful resolution Longuet+Renaudel have found common ground
(2,800 against 120!!) and Bourderon+Raffin-Dugens have gone over
to them!! And Merrheim? Didnât he vote together with Jouhaux for the
pacifist resolution of the C.G.T.!!  

Disgraceful! 

I connect this with Kautskyâs 5Â articles on peace (the same
claptrap)+the Italian Socialist Party and Turatiâs speech of 17/XII. 1916
(the same claptrap).  

The victory of Kautskian pacifism over Zimmerwald, which Grimm
(appeal of the I.S.C. of
30.XII.1916)[2] paints over with r-r-revolutionary phrases!! Just as in
the IIÂ International: a revolutionary signboard+reformist essence.  

I am starting a campaign (or rather, I wish to start it) to expose this
lie.  

And what a disgrace in the Swiss party! 10Â days ago the War Committee
(specially elected by the Central Committee of the party) drew up
2Â resolutions: 5Â votes against defence of the fatherland and 4 in
favour.  
 

Up till now not one has been published!!  

The opportunists (and Grimm!) are trying their hardest to get this
question shelved and the congress put off (on the excuse that the workers
are not prepared! Actually, it is they, the opportunists, who are
dragging out the preparations...).  

They donât want to conduct the elections to parliament (autumn 1917)
under the slogan of non-defence of the fatherland!!  

A shame and utter depravity....  

All the very very, best. I wish you good cheer and the best of
everything in the New Year.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

I am sending you the promised No. of Volksrecht containing the
resolution of the meeting of protest against postponement of the
congress.[1] If there are any Swiss Lefts in Clarens and Lausanne, it
would be a good thing to translate this resolution and get them to protest
too.  

Return
Kamenev[2] directly to me when you have read it, as I have not read it
yet.  

I am sending you the catalogues for 2Â days: look through them and write
out (the titles and numbers) what is of interest to you. I shall
be able to send you one book at a time from this library. I also have the
big main

  Â  

catalogue: I can send you this too if you are interested and if it
is not available at the local public library.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The newspaper Volksrecht No.Â 5 for January 6, 1917, carried an
article on the party meeting held in the Zurich Peopleâs House on
JanuaryÂ 5. One point in the adopted resolution ex pressed a protest against
âthe agitation being carried on behind the scenesâ for postponing the
party congress.

Dear M.Â N., 

I had just sent you a postcard about the pamphlet (in reply to yours)
when I started receiving the money and have now received 500Â frs. in 2Â instalments, for which I thank you very much.  

I have also received a formal answer (from the P.O.) that my manuscript
on
      economics,[1]

which I sent you on 2.VII.1916, saisi lâautoritÃ©
  militaire!!![2]


Simply incredible!! Can anything be done about it, or is it hopeless?


Best regards and best wishes,

 Yours,

 V.Â Ulyanov

Dear V.Â A., 

Youâve given me a proper âwiggingâ over NicholasÂ II, havenât
 you?[1]


As regards Garton Foundation I have seen no mention of it and
I donât know where and how to look for it. Donât you remember where you
have read it? Couldnât you find that No. of the newspaperâI would then be
able to trace it in the library here.  

I am enclosing Volksrecht where, in addition to the
declaration of the C.C., take note of the resolution of the Zurich meeting
against postponement of the
congress.[2] Will Olga please move this in the Geneva group of the
Zimmerwald Lefts and support it in every way, translate the resolution, get
a similar one adopted, and so on (we draft ed this resolution here in the
circle of Zimmerwald Lefts. It is desirable that we act jointly).  

I should not like to go to Geneva:
(1.) I am unwell; bad nerves. I shy at lectures;
(2) I am engaged here on 22.I, and must prepare for a German
report. Therefore, I cannot promise to come. (Let me know whatâs this
meeting Guilbeaux proposes, a meeting of whom, when?  Can I be
useful? In what way?)  

All the very best to both of you. Kindest regards.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

Yesterday we had a meeting of the Left Germans. Mostly workers, some
young people. We havenât got the work running smoothly yet: I have a dual,
uncertain impression. Heâs a nice one, Nobs! A worker sent him a Left
article about the mean trick in putting off the congress. Nobs put the
article in over the manâs signature, and the next day printed another
article of a different trend; he mutilated the Left
article, pruned it away, and I discovered this by accident at the meeting,
when I criticised the article in just those passages which Nobs
had mutilated!  

And these are âLeftsâ!  

Incidentally, it emerged at the meeting that there were contacts with
the Lefts in NeuchÃ¢tel, who had previously come out against the
opportunists. It wouldnât be a bad idea to take a trip there with addresses
(or letters of introduction, which I could get here) and brief them, read
them a lecture, make contacts and so on.  

Did I write you that Name, at a meeting of the Parteivorstand (7.I),
had the honesty to speak against Grimm, to reproach him precisely
as âinternational secretaryâ?  

Olga writes me today that Guilbeaux delivered a report on the French
congress, scathingly criticised the Longuetists (âhe out-does youâ, as
she writes) and stood for a split. Thatâs good, but he, Guilbeaux, has no
base, he is a man of moods, he has no foundations, no theory. That
is dangerous. He is expecting his wife from Paris, who is carrying on
agitation there. Guilbeaux and Brilliant have agreed to adopt a resolution
of protest against postponement of the congress. They are having a meeting
of delegates on 22.I to vote this resolution.  

The day after tomorrow, Sunday, we here are having a meeting of the
Bureau of Lefts (Grigory, Radek and I) on the question of a protest against
Grimm. We shall see!  

I wish you all the very best, and ask you again to make a trip
somewhere, if only for a time, if only with lectures or anything else, so
as to have a change, to throw yourself

  Â  

into some absorbing occupation, something useful to new and fresh
people. Believe me, work among the French is extremely needful and
extremely useful.  

I have received the book and catalogues. Merci.  

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

I have received your letter and the cutting from Russkiye
Vedomosti. Thanks very much.  

Dear friend! I know how terribly bad you feel and I am eagerly anxious
to help you in any way I can. What about your trying to live at some place
where there are friends and where you could chronically have talks on Party
affairs and chronically take part in them?  

I received a letter today from Guilbeaux, a short one. He writes that
they are preparing a meeting on the question of peace. I have written
4Â articles (or chapters) on this for Novy Mir (they are said to
pay 5Â dollars for an article, which would be most welcome, by the
way).[2] I am sending them to you. Will you consider the following
plan: I could let you have further material and you would prepare a French
lecture on this subject, a highly topical one, and make the round of French
Switzerland with it? It would be extremely useful to the cause, as there is
no end of pacifist muddle in everybodyâs head, and this muddle can
be dissipated only by steady, systematic influence. No really, tackle this,
draw up the most detailed theses for your lecture (we could
discuss them together) or else write out the whole lecture. The French
workers in Switzerland have no one to lecture them on the Marxist
attitude to pacifism, and you could do that and give the workers
plenty of food for thought. Start

  Â  

preparing little by little right now; the work will
absorb you. Believe me, absorbing work is most important and
soothing for health and mind! Iâll send you cuttings from
Bataille,[3] the texts of resolutions, texts from
Avanti! (I can obtain back numbers of Avanti!âyou can
easily learn to read Italian; that, too, would be extremely
important, as there are very many Italian workers in Switzerland,
and they, too, have no one to teach them Marxism).  

Grimm is calling (this is between ourselves) a conference of socialists
of the Entente for 23.I (to discuss their conduct at the
conference of chauvinist socialists of the Entente). We are preparing a
sharp protest against Grimm (even to the extent of demanding his
resignation from the I.S.C.)  for his despicable behaviour in the matter of
congress
    postponement.[1]

I strongly advise you to look for Volksrecht (I shall send you the
issue containing the resolution), Berner Tagwacht (you can have
that sent from Berne, canât you? Especially the issue of 8 or 9.I) and
GrÃ¼tlianer (4.I and 9.I). I shall be writing you more about
this. The meeting of the Swiss partyâs Executive (Parteivorstand) of
7.I.Â 1917 was an historic one: they have postponed for an
indefinite time a congress devoted precisely to the MilitÃ¤rfrage!! And
Grimm took the lead coming out in favour of postponement together
with the social-patriots!! No, this is a thing we shall make him pay
for. We are having a meeting of the Lefts here today. Grigory and I have
written to Radek, inviting him and Roland-Holst and others to protest
against Grimm. We shall invite Guilbeaux too, but he is right out of his
depth on this question, and your lecture (whether a public lecture or a
talk in the Geneva group of Lefts to begin with) would be useful in the
extreme.  

Olga has written me that some Left Frenchman is arriving to see
Guilbeaux (and she has put Guilbeaux up to the idea of inviting me to meet
him. I feel awkward about it, itâs inconvenient; I am not going). But is it
a Frenchman arriving for 23.I?? If you could spend some time
around that date (23.I) in Geneva and read (or prepare) your
lecture there, you could probably run into the Frenchman from Paris by
accident (the accidental part of it is important) and teach

  Â  

him quite a lot. Prepare your lecture or talk for 25.I, will you?? (And if
âtheyâ are not to return by 25, then, after your talk with
Guilbeaux, put it off until their return: in this way you could âcatchâ
both Guilbeaux and the Frenchman, eh??)  

You had better wait going to see Abramovich, as he wrote me yesterday
that he was sending information from the printing shop. We had
better wait till it arrives.  

All the very very best, and wishing you to come to speedy grips with
your lecture (it will come in useful to you later in any case).  

Yours,
 Lenin 


P.S. Pacifism now is the question of the day. It is
here, i.Â e., on this question, that we must now teach (Guilbeaux
and the French in particular) to present it in a Marxist manner. Answer me
on this point without delay.

last issue (No.Â 58) of Sotsial Demokrat, JanuaryÂ 31, 1917, under

Dear Friend, 

Only today, Monday, we finished the conference on the anti-Grimm
protest which we had started yesterday. It was attended also by a German, a
member of Die Internationale group, fully a âLeftâ.  

We adopted such an emphatic statement against Grimm (demanding his
removal from the I.S.C.) that Platten called it âpolitical murderâ.  

This is strictly between ourselves for the time being.  

It will take a week or two to have this sent to Roland Holst and the
others and get their reply.  
 

I am pretty tiredâI have got unused to meetings!  

I trust that you are not answering my suggestion about your French
lecture trip not because you are absolutely against it, but simply because
you are considering this plan with the idea of accepting it. I am not
hurrying you, and shall not repeat my persuasions, but I would very much
like you to take a change of air, to visit new and old friends, I would
dearly love to say a lot of kind words to you to make things easier for you
until you get into your stride with work that will engross you completely.


All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. I am expecting this anti-Grimm protest to do a lot of good.

Dear Friends, 

I am badly in need of Diskussionny Listok issued by the
C.O. of the R.S.D.L.P. (Paris, 1910 or 1911), containing my
article against Martov and Trotsky on the Russian revolution (giving
statistics on strikes and % of uyezds with a peasant
      movement).[1]

Only a few Nos. of Diskussionny Listok were issued, and you
should have them. It would not be difficult to find the
article. Please send it to me at once. I

  Â  

shall return both this and the previous material sent to me very soon.

Dear Friend, 

If Switzerland is drawn into the war, the French will occupy Geneva
immediately. To be in Geneva then is to be in France, and from there, to be
in touch with Russia. I am therefore thinking of turning over the
Party funds to you (for you to keep on your person, sewed
up in a special little bag, as the bank wonât let you draw it during the
war). I am writing to Grigory about this. These are merely plans, between
ourselves for the time being.  

I think that we shall remain in Zurich, that war is improbable.  

My very best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

Please translate the enclosed resolution into French and
return it to me (after having a copy made for the Lausanne
German
group).[1] 
 

The resolution has been adopted here by the Lefts and is going
all round Switzerland.  

We must try and get it circulated among all Party members and
passed through all Party organisations, however small.  

Should even a single organisation, however small, adopt this
resolution, it should be sent officially to both the local and
central headquarters of the Party (GeschÃ¤ftsleitung der
Soz. Partei. Zurich. Volkshaus) with a demand that it be
published.  

Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. I am sending a copy to Olga for Guilbeaux and one to Abramovich.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to the resolution of the Swiss Lefts demanding that
a referendum be held on the question of convening the emergency party
congress, which was postponed indefinitely by a ruling of the Executive of
the Swiss Social-Democratic Party. The text of the resolution in German
with Leninâs amendments is in the Central Party Archives of the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism under the C.C., C.P.S.U. The resolution of the Lefts
formed the basis of the referendum, which was held after the local
organisations had gone on record for having the congress convened in the
spring. On JanuaryÂ 23, 1917, Volksrecht (No.Â 19) published an
appeal of the referendum sponsor group under the heading âDas Referendum
gegen den ParteivorstandsbeschlÃ¼ss ergriffenâ (âReferendum Against
Executiveâs Decision Has Begunâ).

Dear Friend, 

I am enclosing Abramovichâs letter (return it immediately) and
an American leaflet (return when finished with, not urgent).  

Abramovichâs letter shows that things are going well (here too:
yesterday a resolution was adopted against the congress being put off and
calling for a referendum on the
congress[1]).  

This shows that we must make great haste with our publishing
business (leaflets and sheets). Great haste!! (and start a German
publishing business of our own through the German groups both in
La Chaux-de-Fonds and in Lausanne).  

Hurry up with your trip to La Chaux-de-Fonds for a few days, get an
exact estimate from the printing shop (not yourself,

  Â  

but through Abramovich) and write to me as soon as possible. How much money
can you raise and how soon:
50frs.? 100 or 200?  

Hurry! Best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. About the war, there is no danger: general mobilisation

This refers to the referendum on the question of convening an emergency
congress of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party to discuss its attitude
towards the war. Despite the fight started by the leaders of the party
Robert Grimm, Jacques Schmid, Friedrich Schneider, Herman Greulich and
Gustav Muller (see present edition, Vol.Â 23, pp.Â 283â86) against this
referendum, the latter met with a warm response among the workers of German
and French Switzerland.

Dear Friend, 

I received the translation. Thanks awfully. I have sent it
 on.[1]


As regards the censorship to which you have subjected my French
      article,[2]

I am surprised, really. As you did not send me the original, aid I would
hardly undertake a French translation myself, I sent it, of course, as you
suggested, omitting the passage about Engels.  

âThe mere thought that I am defending Engelsâs point of view on war
and on the stand the Germans took at the time, makes your blood boil and
you cannot translate it....â  

Well, well! I am surprised! We, Grigory and I, quoted this
passageâmore than passage: statement, declaration of Engelsâmany times,
directly and indirectly, in 1914 and 1915.  

Engels, it should be remembered, wrote this first for the
French socialists and it was published in their Almanach du
Parti
Ouvrier.[3] At that time the French did not protest,

  Â  

feelingâif not realising clearlyâthat the war of
Boulanger+AlexanderÂ III against Germany of those days would be
anti-democratic only on their part, but on the part of Germany (of
whose imperialism there could be no question at the time!!) it
would really be only âdefenceâ, really a war for national existence.


And now, what the French themselves acknowledged in 1891 to be correct,
you suddenly cry down, and how! And just before that, at a meeting of the
Swiss Lefts, they (semiÂ pacifists, what can you do?) dismissed my reference
to this statement of Engelsâs with amazing frivolity of their own peculiar
brand.  

You did not say anything either about my article in reply to Kievsky.


My work with the Swiss Lefts, like my reflections on the absurdities
which Radek has talked himself into, convince me more and more that on the
vital question of motives for rejecting defence of the fatherland
our stand is the only correct one. Have you seen No.Â 6 of
Jugend-Internationale, of which I wrote in Sb. No.Â 2 (did
you get it?) and Arbeiterpolitik
No.Â 25?[4] 

I have received a postcard from Kamenev. I shall send it to you. Olga
writes that things are looking up with the Lefts, that an organisation of
Zimmerwald Lefts, French+ Italian (!!Â I am ever so pleased about
this)+Russian, has been founded and that Guilbeaux will write to me about
it (I shall forward it on to you, if you like). I try to follow
Avanti! and am becoming convinced that Souvarine is right: Turati
is quite a Kautskyite and he is switching the whole Italian socialist
parliamentary group (into these lines. His last speech (17.I) is smart:
heâs a smart alec of bourgeois pacifism, and not a socialist at all.  

I wish you the very, very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

It was very interesting yesterday at Olten. Non-attendance of the
French and Italians enabled Radek+Levi+Grigory+MÃ¼nzenberg to tell Grimm
the whole truth to his face. Radek told me this today, and Grigory will
probably write to you about it.  

Re Arbeiterpolitik, write to Radekâhe has already left
(Herrn Sobelsohn. Zur Stelle. Davos-Dorf).  

On what âcentral pointâ I did not answer you, I cannot even guess.


Am waiting for you to explain.  

I know about Marxâs English works; they are special things that I shall
have to read in due course (I bought some of them in London and started to
read them, but did not finish), but now I have no time.  

That Grimm âdoes not want a mass movementâ, or rather does not want
revolutionary work, you are quite right. His article is generally and
wholly Kautskian, Centrist, fraudulent.  

That Berne Kautskyite and 0.Â C. man Spectator has issued a small
pamphlet in Berne on
   Vaterlands-Verteidigung[1]

(25Â cts) in which he tries to play off Radek and me against each other (I
havenât read it all yet. I have only seen
this),[2] as Martov tried to do yesterday (defending!!!  Grimm). A
futile, vain attempt!  

All the best,

 Lenin

Dear Radek, 

Spectatorâs
       pamphlet[1]

is so absurd that at first I had doubts whether it was worth answering. But
as this petty intrigant is trying, by the most despicable and stupid means,
to make capital out of our differences, I presumeâespecially since he
names me, and only me, personallyâthat it is my right
and my duty to answer him. I shall do everything to have this
reply published not only in Russian.  

As regards our draft resolution against defence of the
fatherland (for
    Switzerland),[2]

I forgot to tell you the following: my draft (the opening Â§Â§ in
my theses) satisfied you, that is, I succeeded then in expressing our
common point of view. Why not adopt it as a basis for our joint
draft?  

My best regards,

 Ulyanov 

P.S. I have received from America No.Â 1 of the new weekly
Internationalist. They announce in the Manifesto their solidarity
with the âLefts in Europeâ. The publisher is Pannekoek of
Vorbote. What should I send youâthe English original or the
Russian translation?

Dear Friend, 

I havenât had a single line from you for a long time. You promised
almost a week ago to write âtomorrowââand not a sound. Has there been
anything special to prevent it? Drop me at least a line, if you arenât in a
writing mood, otherwise I feel worried.  

Re 1.II, I wrote you briefly, if I am not mistaken.  

On 3.II there was a meeting (strictly private) between Grimm and his
friends+Nobs and Platten. (MÃ¼nzenberg and Bronski were invited, but
refused to go to these Zentrumsleute, and a good thing too.) Nobs and
Platten are weak-willed men (if not worse), and are dead âafraidâ of
Grimm.  

They adopted some amendments to the resolution (of course, Grimm
âtrickedâ Nobs and Platten). I havenât seen these amendments yet. They
should be published tomorrow
(Thursday).[2] On the whole, the Lefts here, I must say, are
super-trash.  

Yesterday there was a meeting (meetings tire me; nerves no good at all;
headaches; left before the end)âa general meeting. Re-elected the
executive of the whole Zurich organisation. Elected Bronski
too. And would you believe itâthe social-patriot scoundrels
(with Baumann at the head) got up and walked
 out.[1]

We donât want to work with Bronski!!  

And Nobs+Platten swallowed the pill and put through a postponement!!
What a disgrace!! And these are Lefts!! And the Young are âafraidâ of
Nobs and Platten!!  

I hear that Humbert-Droz has lectured already in Geneva and is seducing
the young people with his idiotic pacifism. It would be a good thing if you
gave him a number of public battles, politely but firmly pointed out to him
the

  Â  

whole infamy of pacifism, its whole staggering banality, and put forward a
revolutionary programme!  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

You are right about the âmajorityâsâ corrected resolution (of the
Swiss party): itâs worse than bad. Itâs a fully Centrist, Kautskian
resolution. Grimm made a mess of it, and Nobs and Platten backed
down. On Sunday there was a congress of the cantonal Zurich
S.Â D. party; our (âYoungâ) people moved a Left resolution drafted by us,
which collect ed 32Â votes. This is a great success.  

Abramovich was to have sent you the text of my resolution (the
practical part of which was largely included in the resolution tabled at
the congress the day before yesterday (you will get it from the newspapers
if you havenât learned about it
already)).[2] 

I think you ought to prepare a lecture (in French) on the three trends
in the Swiss party. The materialâreferendum+ three resolutions (that of
the Right, Grimmâs and the Left). Itâs worth it, really.  

Humb.-Droz, seeing that he is a Tolstoyan, should be fought all
along the line. Most definitely!  

It isnât true that revolutionary mass action in Switzer land is
âimpossibleâ. What about the general strike in Zurich in 1912? And we had
this action in Geneva and in La Chaux-de-Fonds too. Now, during the war,
action by the masses and even a revolution in Switzerland are still
more possible (this would be of importance for France and Germany).

 

There is ground in the Swiss party for building up a Left
trend. This is a fact. It will be rewarding, though not easy, work.


Where did you find the documents on Engelsâs preface to the class
struggle?  In Neue Zeit? Do you know that the Berlin âleadersâ
have struck out of this preface its revolutionary end?  

Re the war (of â91) I am waiting for your remarks on that âcentral
pointâ on which you say I was silent.  

JaurÃ¨s, Disc.
       parlem.[1]

Volume Two missing.  

Could you get the Works of Fourier and find, for me what he
has to say about the merging of nationalities?  

All the very best,

 Lenin 

P.S. Have you been able to influence Mrs. Belousov
(heâs a fool, you know) and Usiyevichâs wife?

This refers to the âProposed Amendments to the Resolution on the War
Issueâ drafted by Lenin and adopted at the cantonal congress of the Zurich
Social-Democratic Organisation in TÃ¶ss.  

This congress was held February 11â12, 1917. The party organ
Volksrecht, in its issue No.Â 36 for FebruaryÂ 12, 1917, devoted an
editorial to it, headed âDer Parteitag in TÃ¶ssâ.  

The congress had before it two draft resolutions: =

(1) a social-chauvinist draft submitted by minority members of the
Commission on the war issue, and =

(2) a Centrist draft from the Commission majority. The latter was adopted
by 93 votes to 65. The Lefts voted for the resolution in order to prevent
the social-chauvinist draft from being adopted, but they moved Leninâs
âProposed Amendments to the Resolution on the War Issueâ, which

 Â  

were adopted by the congress (see present edition, Vol.Â 23, p.Â 282).

Dear Friend, 

I am sending you a leaflet. Will you please translate it into French
and
English.[1] The German translation will be made for me in Berne, I
hope.  

I am greatly interested in the idea of such propaganda, especially of
the May Day strikeâa strike like this was suggested by one of the Lefts
in Switzerland (Holzarbeiter-Zeitung, Schweizerische, von
27.I.1917). Iâd very much like to send this leaflet to Paris. I hope Grisha
will be able to get it published, and it will find its way to Germany, too,
afterwards, I think.  
 

Please translate it in vigorous language, in short sentences. Please
write it in duplicate on thin paper as clearly as possible to avoid
misprints. If possible let Usiyevich (keeping the thing secret) make a copy
from the Russian text to be forwarded to Abramovich (together with
one copy of the French translation). The two English copies, one French
copy and my Russian text return to me as soon as possible. We must
hurry, because in view of mailing difficulties, there is not much time left
until 1.V, and we must start agitation beforehand.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. Nadya feels better today, though she is still in bed. She sends
you warm regards. Read the enclosed and forward it to Abramovich together
with the Russian text and the French translation.

Dear Friend, 

If you send me your theses on the war question, I shall be glad to
discuss them, of course. As for your coming out against Golay, I donât see
why the idea of its being âawkwardâ should occur to you. In my opinion,
on the contrary, itâs anything but awkward and extremely useful. We have
got to come out as strongly and bluntly as possible against the ridiculous
pacifism of the French (achieving socialism without revolution, and so on)
and the ridiculous belief in democracy. Golay, in my opinion, should be
given a special and public trouncing for recanting the valuable

  Â  

admissions in his pamphlet Le Socialisme qui meurt. I consider
this pamphlet excellent material for criticising the weakness and shallow
thinking of the French Lefts.  

I have received from you a copy of the Russian text of the leaflet (I
am very pleased that you liked it). But there is no sign of the French
text!! Yet I asked for it to be done in duplicate!!! The thought that we
shall be late preys on my mindâthere is only 2Â months to go until 1.Â V
and the difficulties of communicating with the warring countries are
enormous.  

As regards Usiyevich, you write yourself that he is âspinelessâ. So I
did not scold him for nothing (and I asked for the letter to be shown to
you so that we could agree on methods of influencing him).  

So please hurry up as much as you can with the French and
English translations of the leaflet. If for any reason you couldnât do it
in duplicate, then at least let me know exactly when you sent the leaflet
(French) to Abramovich.  

I am ever so pleased to hear that you are coming out more often before
the youth. A useful thing! The young are the only people worth working on!
Everything must be done to break down their pacifism and disbelief in the
mass movement (what about the Zurich strike of 1912? And in Geneva in 1900
or 1902?). It would be a good thing if you could collect material on the
big strikes in the history of the labour movement in French Switzerland.


Nadya has recovered.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. I have read Pannekoekâs discussion with Kautsky in Neue
Zeit (1912). Kautsky is despicably mean, and Pannekoek, but for some
inaccuracies and slight mistakes, is almost
right. Kautsky is the acme of opportunism.

Dear Friend, 

I havenât heard from you for a long time.  

Things here in Zurich with the German Lefts are as bad as
ever. After Nobs and Platten crossed âback to Grimmâ the leaders of the
Young tagged along after them. MÃ¼nzenberg turned down Radekâs
articles against Grimm; Bucher and other friends of MÃ¼nzenberg repeat the
same phrases about the danger of a âsplitâ!! It would be funny, were it
not so disgusting....  

I am urging Grigory to try a German newspaper (he is being
offered 300Â frs. for it?), but it looks as if this last card will be
beaten too.  

I envy you and Grigory, because you are both able to lecture
publicly. After all, when you deliver a public lecture you have
fresh people in front of you, workers, a crowd, and not just
officials or officials-to-be, or a handful of people browbeaten by
officials. In a public lecture you speak to the mass, you make
direct contact with it, you see it, meet it and influence it
in your own way.  

Apparently here, in Zurich, the fuss and bother over the German Lefts
is over. The referendum motivation and the resolution of the Lefts
in TÃ¶ss are the only fruits. I donât regret the time wasted,
though (I am in a very angry state of mind just now, as I have come in from
a meeting of the Lefts that did not take place: our people
scattered!). I donât regret it because to my theoretical understanding of
the rottenness of the European parties has now been added a
practical understanding of some use.  

Public lectures are a good thing, anyway, and they should be used for a
direct fight against both the Centre (Grimm & Co.) and the âLeftsâ
(like Nobs, Platten, Name, Graber, Droz, etc.).  

I suppose you donât feel like working on the translation of the leaflet
into English? In that case, drop it: Iâll send it as it is to Paris, maybe
theyâll find some Englishman there.

  Â  

Abramovich is a good chap, thatâs where work is going well!  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Friend, 

Obviously my former explanations of your silence were erroneous.  

You did not âtake offenceâ, did you, at my writing you about your not
having gone over the French text? Incredible! Incredible because
Abramovich, too, wrote to me on the same subject. Besides, is it
conceivable that anyone can take offence at such a thing??
Inconceivable!!  

And on the other hand, the complete silence, for instance, on the
question of the English translation is strange....  

Of course, if you donât feel like answering, or even if you do, and
have decided not to, I shall not pester you with my questions.  

The Lefts in Switzerland have now scattered away from us both here and
in Berne. (Things are good only with Abramovich and with you, as you have
direct means of approach to the mass in lectures and
Abramovich has them in personal contacts.)  

The talks with Yuri & Co. for the publication by them of
pamphlets endorsed by the C.C. section abroad are finished. This is
welcome news!  

From Russiaânothing, not even letters!! We are making arrangements
via Scandinavia.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

P.S. I am writing Usiyevich today in reply to his letter, in a spirit
of âreconciliationâ.

Dear Friend, 

I am writing to you on my way back from a lecture. Yesterday (Saturday)
I lectured on the
amnesty.[2] We are all dreaming of leaving. If you are going home drop
in to see us first. Weâll have a talk. I would very much like you to find
out for me in England discreetly whether I would be granted passage.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 V.Â U. 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This letter (postcard) to Inessa Armand in Clarens was written by Lenin
on his way to Zurich from La Chaux-de-Fonds and posted by him in Ambulant
(Switzerland). In La Chaux-de-Fondsâa large working-class centre of
SwitzerlandâLenin delivered a lecture (in German) at a workersâ club on
the Paris Commune and the prospects of development of the Russian
revolution (âWill the Russian Revolution Follow the Path of the Paris
Commune?â).





[2]
Lenin is referring to the declaration of the Provisional Government
setting fort its political programme, one point of which provided for a
complete and immediate amnesty in political and religious cases (see
Vestnik Vremennogo Pravitelstva No.Â 1, MarchÂ 5, 1917).

Dear Friend, 

I am writing you in reply to the letters I received from you today and
in connection with the talk we had on the telephone.  

I must say I am keenly disappointed. In my opinion everybody these days
should have a sing]e thoughtâto rush off. Yet people are
âwaitingâ for something!!...  
 

I am sure that I will be arrested or simply detained in England if I go
under my own name, as it was England that not only confiscated a number of
my letters to America, but asked (her police) Papasha in 1915 whether he
corresponded with me and whether he was in touch with the German socialists
through me.  

Itâs a fact! Therefore, I cannot personally make any move unless very
âspecialâ measures have been taken.  

What about the others? I was certain that you would rush off to
England, as only there could you find out how to get through and how great
the risk is (they say via Holland, LondonâHollandâScandinavia, the risk
is slight) and so on.  

Yesterday I wrote you a postcard on my way
back,[1]

thinking that you were doubtlessly planning and had decided to go to Berne
to see the consul. But you write that you are undecided and want to think
it over.  

My nerves, naturally, are overstrung. No wonder! To have to sit here on
tenterhooks....  

Probably you have special reasons, your health maybe is bad, and so on.


I shall try to persuade Valya to go (she came running down to see us on
Saturday after having kept away for a year!). But the revolution doesnât
interest her much.  

Oh, yes, I nearly forgot. What you could and should do immediately in
Clarens is to start looking out for pass ports
(Î±) among Russians who would agree to give theirs (without them
knowing itâs for me) to enable another per son to leave the country;
(Î²) among Swiss men or women who would give theirs to a Russian.  

Anna Yevg. and Abram should be made immediately to go to the
embassy to get a pass (if they are refused, to complain by wire to
Milyukov and Kerensky) and leave, or, if they donât intend to leave, to let
us know on the basis of facts (and not words) what the procedure
is for getting a pass.  

All the best,

 Yours,

 Lenin 
 

In Clarens (and the vicinity) there are many wealthy and not-so-wealthy
Russian social-patriots, etc. (Troyanovsky, Rubakin, etc.), who should ask
the Germans to allow the passage of a railway coach to Copenhagen for
various revolutionaries.  

Why not?  

I cannot do it. I am a âdefeatistâ.  

But Troyanovsky and Rubakin+Co. can.  

Oh, if I could only teach sense to these noodles and riffraff!...  

You will say, perhaps, that the Germans wonât give a coach. I
bet you they will!  

Of course, if they get to know that this idea comes from me or
from you, the thing will be ruined....  

Are there any fools in Geneva for this purpose?...

Dear Comrade, 

I thank you very, very much for the information. I shall not go now
either to read the lecture or to the
meeting,[1] as I have to write daily for Pravda in Petrograd.


My best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

Please continue to keep me informed of news and speeches of the
different trends.

Karpinsky invited Lenin to Geneva to deliver a lecture to Russian

The meeting of Russian and Swiss internationalists mentioned in the
letter took place on MarchÂ 9 (22), 1917. Lenin did not attend it.

22/III.1917 

Dear Friend, 

I have just sent off by express post to Christiania (Vidnes,
Social-Demokraten, for Kollontai) two letters enclosing two
       articles[1]

for the Petrograd Pravda. I hope both letters will find Kollontai
in Christiania before her departure (she is leaving 27.III in the
morning). If they donât, will you kindly, first, check whether the
forwarding machinery in Christiania is working well; secondly, if need be,
forward it all yourself. I am using only one Petrograd address for
the time being: Mr. Vlad. Bonch-Bruyevich, Zhizn i Znaniye Publishing
House, 38Â Fontanka, FlatÂ 19, Petrograd. This publisher will deliver it at
once to Pravda.  

I hope you will immediately start sending me Pravda
and everything else of the same kind. Please wire me immediately
on receipt of this letter: âletter received, dispatch arranged.â  

Greetings and congratulations!

 Yours,

 Vl.Â Ulyanov 

P.S. I ask you most earnestly to keep me informed.

Dear

You are aware that grave revolutionary events are taking place in
Russia. The Central Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party
considers it very important, therefore, that foreign comrades should be
correctly in formed about this movement. The Central Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. recommends to you Comrade A.Â Kollontai, whose
information is absolutely trustworthy.  

With Social-Democratic greetings, on behalf of the C.C.,
R.S.D.L.P.

Dear Friend, 

I am sending you Kamenevâs postcards, to be returned when you have read
them.  

Have you seen extracts from the C.C.âs Manifesto in Frankfurter
Zeitung (and in Volksrecht)? Good, arenât they!  

Congratulations. 

My best regards,

 Yours,

 Lenin 

P.S. Buy The Times: the best information.  

Valya has been told (at the British embassy) that there is no passage
at all through England.  

What if no passage whatever is allowed either by
England or by Germany!!! And this is possible!  
 

P.S. Read the enclosed copies of my
       articles[1]

at once, give them to Usiyevich to read and send them immediately
to the Karpinskys in Geneva, who are to return them immediately!


N.B. I must have these copies by Monday.

There is no Second Letter. You received it, didnât you?? Then
where is it?  

LettersÂ 3 and 4 for Pravda I shall send to you tomorrow,
Wednesday. When you have read them and shown them to Usiyevich, please
forward them to the Karpinskys. I have a lecture here

Dear Olga, 

Please see that Vyach.Â Al. does not make a fuss over the
typing[1]

âhe

will receive the manuscript from Grigory tomorrow. The arrangement
is: payment no less than before.  

To be typed in duplicate, quarto size desirable (not
obligatory).  

Your marriage
plan[3] sounds very reasonable to me, and I shall stand (in the C.C.)
for 100Â frs. being issued to you: 50Â frs. in the fist of a lawyer and
50Â frs. to a âconvenient old
manâ[2]

for marrying you!  

No, really!! To have the right of entry both into Germany and
into Russia!  

Hurrah! A brilliant idea of yours!  

Best regards,

 Yours,

Lenin 

Please type my letters to Pravda on the thinnest
paper.

Karpinsky wrote in his reminiscences: âOne plan for enabling some
comrades to make the passage was for them to marry a Swiss citizen. This
gave the right to entry both into Germany and Russia. This plan appealed to
Vladimir Ilyich, and he advised Comrade Ravich to find âa convenient old
manâ. He recommended for this purpose the Menshevik P.Â B. Axelrod, who was
a Swiss citizen.â

Please let me know in greatest possible detail, first, whether the
British Government will allow passage to Russia to me and a number of
members of our Party, the R.S.D.L.P. (Central Committee), on the following
conditions:
(a) The Swiss socialist Fritz Platten receives permission from the British
Government to conduct any number of

  Â  

persons through England irrespective of their political allegiances and
their views on war and peace;
(b) Platten alone answers both for the composition of the conducted groups
and for maintaining proper order, and receives a railway coach for
travelling through England, which he, Platten, is to keep locked. No one
can enter this coach without the consent of Platten. This coach shall have
exterritorial rights;
(c) From a port in England Platten conveys the group by the steamer of any
neutral country, with the right to notify all countries of the
sailing time of this special ship;
(d) Railway fares shall be paid by Platten according to the tariff and the
number of seats occupied;
(e) The British Government undertakes not to place obstacles to the
chartering and sailing of a special steamer with Russian political
emigrants and not to detain the steamer in England, enabling the passage to
be made in the quickest possible way.  

Secondly, in the event of agreement, what guarantees can England give
that these conditions will be observed, and whether she has any objection
to these conditions being published.  

If telegraphic inquiries have to be made in London we agree to bear the
expenses of a telegram and a prepaid reply.  

Date.... 
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In Leninâs manuscript in the Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism the addressee is not given. Probably this letter was
intended for Jakub Hanecki or Inessa Armand. Lenin asked Armand on
MarchÂ 18, 1917, to find out whether he would be allowed legal passage from
Switzerland to Russia via England (see ^^DocumentÂ 555^^ in this volume). On
MarchÂ 19, however, Lenin learned that she refused to go to
England. Therefore, he had no reason for sending this document to
Armand. In fact, in his
subsequent letters to her Lenin makes no further mention of his request.



The date in Leninâs MS. is missing. Judging by its contents, this
letter was probably written after the afore-mentioned letters to Armand. It
formulates the conditions for the passage of a group of political emigrants
through the mediation of the Swiss Social-Democrat Fritz Platten. These
conditions, in a somewhat modified form, were set forth in the document
âBasis of Negotiations for the Return of Political Emigrants to Russiaâ
through Germany, signed by Platten AprilÂ 4, 1917 (see Lenin Miscellany
II, pp. 382â83).  

Jakub Hanecki, in his reminiscences, mentions that âafter the first
reports of the February revolutionâ he suggested to Lenin that he travel
to Russia through England. This document, there fore, is more likely to
have been addressed to Hanecki, a member of the R.S.D.L.P., who took an
active part in organising the return of Russian political emigrants from
Switzerland to Russia. This volume contains a number of letters and
telegrams to Hanecki on this question.

I dashed off the previous sheet the day before yesterday in answer to
your letter with questions, but I didnât want to send it without amplifying
it.  

However I was so busy that I had no time to do it until this evening.


I hope we shall be starting out on Wednesdayâtogether with you, I
hope.  

Grigory was here. We have arranged to travel together.  

I trust you have received the money (100Â frs.) sent this morning by
express.  
 

We have more money for the journey than I thought, enough for 10â12
persons. The comrades in Stockholm have been a great help.  

It is quite possible that the majority of the workers in
Petrograd are now social-patriots....  

We shall fight.  

The war will agitate for us.  

A thousand greetings. AuÂ revoir.  

Yours,

Lenin

Dear Friends, 

Things are going well. The plan, of which Comrade Minin knows, is being
carried out. Platten takes everything upon himself. Below I am giving you a
copy of the conditions which Platten has submitted. Apparently they will be
accepted. Otherwise we shall not go. Grimm is still trying

  Â  

to persuade the Mensheviks, but we are acting entirely on our own, of
course. We think we shall leave on Friday, Wednesday and Saturday. And now
this. We want a detailed protocol to be drawn up about everything before we
leave. Platten, Levi (of Berner Tagwacht, representing the press)
and others will be invited to sign it. French participation would be highly
desirable. N.B. Talk it over immediately with Guilbeaux, explain the
situation to him, show him the terms, and if he sympathises, ask him to
come at a wire from here (expenses defrayed). This would be very
important. It is highly probable that we shall also invite Charles Name
(Platten will talk it over with him on the telephone).  

Still more important: if Guilbeaux sympathises, perhaps

 N.B.  

he could get Romain Rolland too to sign. Extremely important:
there was a paragraph in Petit Parisien that Milyukov has
threatened to prosecute everybody who comes in through Germany. Tell
Guilbeaux this. French participation, in view of this, is especially
important. Answer immediately. Sincerely yours.

 4/IVâ1917 

We have received a telegram from Perm: âSalut fraternel Ulianow,
Zinowieff. Aujourdhui partons Petrograd
 etc.[1]

Signed: Kamenev, Muranov, Stalin.â

(have forwarded it for publication to ZÃ¼richer
Volksrecht) and have sent the âFarewell Letterâ to be set up.


I trust also that you have sent Radek (address: FÃ¼rstenbergâinside:
for RadekâBirgerjarlsgatan, 8. Stockholm) the missing document for the
minutes, namely: the resolution of the meeting of Mensheviks,
Nachalo
people[3] and others against the journey.  

Did I give you the address of my people? Maria Ilyinichna Ulyanova (for
V.Â I.Â U.), Petrograd, 48/9 Shirokaya Ulitsa, FlatÂ 24. Write me a postcard
at this address saying whether the
   Abschiedsbrief[2]

has come out (and in what languages), whether it has been sent to Stockholm
and so on.  

Donât forget to contact Grisha and get from him the French and English
opposition newspapers for Radek.  

Greetings,
 Yours,

 Lenin

Dear Comrade, 

Letter No.Â 1 (dated AprilÂ 22â23) has been received today 21/IVâold
style.  

The money from Kozlovsky (2Â thous.) has been received. The packets have
not arrived yet. Delivery of newspapers from the provinces is terribly
irregular, and we have no

  Â  

sets ourselves, just odd numbers. Altogether about 15Â Bolshevik newspapers
are issued: in Helsingfors, Kronstadt, Kharkov, Kiev, Krasnoyarsk, Samara,
Saratov and other cities. In Moscow a daily
appearsâSotsial-Demokrat. In Kharkov, Kronstadt and Helsingfors,
too, there are dailies. The All-Russia conference starts tomorrow; up to
300Â delegates are expected. Petrograd is seething; meetings and
demonstrations are going on since yesterday over the governmentâs Note. It
is very difficult to get organised in this ferment. Everyone is swamped
with work. Arranging messengers is no easy job, but we shall nevertheless
take measures. A special man is coming now to organise the whole business,
and we hope he will get things moving. Telegrams take a terribly long time,
telegraphic communication even in land is difficult. Since a person is
going, no telegram con firming receipt of letter No.Â 1 has been sent. As
regards Steinberg, we shall take steps.  

We send greetings to Radek. Itâs such a busy day today that we simply
cannot write a detailed letter and resolutions concerning the conference,
and so on. You will learn it all from Pravda, which we are sending
you. Telegrams donât reach destination. The question of organising
telegraphic communication therefore remains open. Communication must be
arranged some other way. What news have you of Platten? Has he returned and
did he arrive safely?  

Best regards.  

Reports about huge demonstrations, shooting and so on have just come
in.

Dear Comrades, 

I received your invitation and thank you for it with all my heart. I
regret that I am absolutely unable to attend your congress today in view of
my commitments to the All-Russia conference of our Party.  

The conference proceedings have dragged out, there will probably be an
all-night sitting, and I cannot get away for a minute. Please forgive me.


With comradely greetings,

 N.Â Lenin

29.V.Â 1917 

Dear Friend, 

I am writing to you for the first time, letter No.Â 1, and ask you to
let me know whether you have received it. Try and send Bulletin
No.Â 1 (Pravda
Bulletin)[2] as soon as you canâthen an answer as to whether you
have a reply from Karpinsky in Geneva (I asked him to send me the endâthe
âconclusionââof the book on the agrarian question and the two articles:
Yuriâs, âPyotr Kievskyâsâ, and my own on self-determination).  

I fully agree with you that Zimmerwald has become a hindrance and that
the sooner we break with it the better (you know that I disagree with the
conference on this
point).[3] We must speed up a meeting of the Lefts, an international
meeting and only of the Lefts. Write what you can do in this
direction: we shall send the money (a sum of about 3â4 thous. rubles)
soon.  

If we could speed up an international meeting of the Lefts, the Third
International would be established.  

Can we count on the Scandinavian Lefts? Have you enlightened HÃ¶glund
& Co.?  Is there any hope of getting the English and Americans? What
about your Stockholm trio publishing immediately in the
name of our C.C., plus the Poles, plus Arbeiterpolitik, plus
HÃ¶glund & Co., an inter national appeal for a meeting of
only Lefts (see our resolution for the list) on an international
scale?  

Let us know what steps you are taking.  

Forgive me for not writing more often: I am devilishly busy. I trust
you have been told everything now.  

All the very best,

 Yours,

 Lenin

Radek was then a member of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. (B.) Bureau Abroad
(Stockholm).





[2]
The Pravda Bulletin in German appeared in Stockholm from June
to November 1917 under the heading Russische Korrespondenz
âPrawdaâ. It was published by the agency abroad of the Central
Committee, R.S.D.L.P.(B.) and carried articles on important

 Â  

issues of the revolution in Russia, documents, reviews and news items
dealing with the life of the Party and the country. The Bulletin
was published also in French.





[3]
Lenin is referring to the point in the resolution of the All-Russia
April Conference âThe Situation Within the International and the Tasks of
the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)â which said: âOur Party remains in the Zimmerwald
bloc, where it sets itself the task of upholding the tactics of the
Zimmerwald Left, and directs the Central Committee to take immediate steps
towards founding a Third Internationalââsee The Seventh (April)
All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks). Petrograd City
Conference of the R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks). April
1917. Minutes. Moscow, Gospolitizdat, 1958, p.Â 255. In place of this
point Lenin proposed the following formulation: âWe must remain in
Zimmerwald only for purposes of informationâ (see present
edition, Vol.Â 24, p.Â 82).

With regard to the statement by the Executive of the
       S.D.P.L.[1]

groups submitted to the Legal Committee, I ask the Committee to take into
consideration that the point in this statement âdemanding an explanationâ
from Hanecki is an absolutely impermissible attack on the honour of an
absent comrade (absent on Party business) and an agent of the
C.C. at that.  

To âdemand an explanationâ at the word of an avowed slanderer,
Mr.Â Zaslavsky, who has repeatedly been called a slanderer in the newspaper,
is generally impermissible, and especially impermissible is it to
have this done through the press.  

Mr.Â Zaslavsky acted only as a scandalmonger. A clear legal line should
be drawn between the notion of a scandalmonger or slanderer and a denouncer
(who demands the establishment of demonstrable facts).  

The principle should be established that the Party should not
answer scandalmongering and slander (if only by repeating that a slanderer
is a slanderer) until
(1) a precise accusation is made in the press over the signature of a
definite person who is not an avowed slanderer,
(2) an accusation which should allow both parties to appear in a
court of law,
(3) an accusation of a serious nature supported by political organisations.


Failing this, the comrade affected, and not the
Party, should answer the accusation either in a special pamphlet
(or leaflet: with documents) or merely sweeping aside the
scandalmongering.  

Especially impermissible is the shadow of any doubt as to the honesty
of a Party functionary or the slightest attempt to rummage (âdemand an
explanationâ) in his private life without a preliminary
questioning of witnesses (Rozanov, Chudnovsky, Schter and other
Copenhageners) and a study of documents.  

I request the Legal Committee to consider this statement of mine
concerning the absolute impermissibility of such

  Â  

publications (the mare so when emanating not from the C.C. of the
Poles) as that of the statement submitted to the Legal Committee.

The Executive Committee of the S.D.P.P.L. groups in Russia submitted a
statement to the Legal Committee of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P.(B.)  in connection
with the smear campaign raised against Jakub Hanecki in the bourgeois
press. This statement, a copy of which is in the Central Party Archives of
the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, qualifies the political activities of
Hanecki as irreproachable, but contains a point saying that âHanecki and
other comrades abroad familiar with Comrade Haneckiâs private life should
be asked to give an explanation in connection with the accusations levelled
against this aspect of his lifeâ.  

The Executive of the S.D.P.P.L. intended to publish its statement.


After acquainting himself with this material, Lenin wrote this letter
to the Legal Committee.  

Hanecki, being a member of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P.(B.) Bureau Abroad, was
in Stockholm at the time.

imperialists, who are organising the counter-revolution. All power to the
Soviets. Long live workersâ control over production. The arming of the
whole people. No separate peace with Wilhelm, no secret treaties with the
British and French governments. Immediate publication by the Soviets of
really just terms of peace. Against the policy of offensives. Bread, peace,

17.VI.Â 1917 

Dear Radek, 

Owing to illness I was unable to follow reports during the Last few
days. I therefore have a vague idea of Zimmerwald affairs.  

If itâs true that that muddled wretched Grimm (no wonder

  Â  

we never trusted that ministeriable scoundrel!)
has handed over all Zimmerwald affairs to the Left Swedes and that the
latter are convening a Zimmerwald conference within the next few days, then
Iâpersonally (I am writing this only in my own name)âwould strongly
warn against having anything to do with Zimmerwald 

âWhat a good chance this is to seize the Zimmerwald International
now,â Grigory said today.  

In my opinion, this is super-opportunist and harmful tactics.  

âSeizeâ Zimmerwald? That is, to take upon ourselves the dead
weight of the Italian party (the Kautskyites and pacifists), the Swiss
Greulich & Co., the American S.Â P. (even worse!), all kinds of Peluso,
Longuetists, etc., etc.  

This would mean throwing overboard all our principles, forgetting
everything we wrote and said against the Centre, getting ourselves muddled
up and disgraced.  

No, if the Left Swedes have taken Zimmerwald into their own hands and
if they want to muddle along, we should put an ultimatum to them:
either they declare Zimmerwald dismissed at the very first
Zimmerwald conference and found a Third International, or we quit.  

In any case, that vile (âGrimm-controlledââit is Grimmâs
after all) Zimmerwald should be buried at all costs and a real
Third International founded of the Lefts alone and against the
Kautskyites alone. Better a small fish than a big beetle.  

Read this letter to Orlovsky and Hanecki. My best regards.  

Excuse the brevityâIâm ill.  

Things here mostly resemble the eve of the June days of 1848. The
Mensheviks and S.R.s are surrendering all and everything to the Cadets (=4o
the Cavaignacs). Qui vivra
verra.[1]


Yours,
 Lenin

Only just now, at 3.15Â p.m., JulyÂ 7, I learned that a search was made
at my flat last night, despite the protests of my wife, by armed men who
produced no warrant. I register my protest against this and ask the Bureau
of the C.E.C. to investigate this flagrant breach of the law.  

At the same time I consider it my duty to confirm officially and in
writing what, I am sure, not a single member of the C.E.C. can doubt,
namely, that in the event of the government ordering my arrest and this
order being endorsed by the C.E.C., I shall present myself for arrest at
the place indicated to me by the C.E.C.

[1]
This letter was written by Lenin to the Bureau of the Central Executive
Committee of the All-Russia Soviet of Workersâ and Soldiersâ Deputies.


On the evening of JulyÂ 7 (20) a meeting of C.C. members and a number of
Parry officials was held in the home of S.Â Y. Alliluyev, a veteran
Bolshevik workman, where Lenin was in hiding at the time. The meeting was
attended, among others, by Lenin, Nogin, Orjonikidze, Stalin and
Stasova. It was decided that Lenin was not to appear in the court of the
counter-revolutionary Provisional Government. On July 13â14 (26â27),
1917, the enlarged meeting of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P.(B.), followed by the
Sixth Congress of the Party, adopted a resolution against Lenin appearing
in court (see The Sixth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.). Minutes,
Moscow, 1958, p.Â 270).

Dear Comrade Rovio, 

I am taking this opportunity to find out whether you received my letter
enclosing a letter to
       Smilga[1]

and whether you passed that letter on to him.  

The bearer is returning in a couple of days. Will you please pass this
letter on to Smilga, as I would like him too to know that I am anxious
about whether he received my letter and am waiting for his reply.  

Greetings,
 Yours,

 K.Â Ivanov 

Could you send me a set of
(1)
Priboi[2]

and
(2)
Sotsialist-Revolutsioner[3] for the last 1Â 1/2 weeks?  
 

P.S. Did you send the letter and newspapers through friends to Sweden?
