Letter to Nakhamkis

1. We shall carry it.

2. The plusses of the article. [Remarks about the mass
and Social-Democratic mass movement—the impossibility
for Social-Democrats to renounce their strict Social–
Democratic principles even for a moment—about propaganda and
agitation, and the relationship between political rights and
political freedom. About not narrowing down the
significance of May Day, etc. ]

3. The minus. Some minor alterations in the article are
desirable, and we suggest what they might be, hoping that
joint discussions of them will bring us to complete
agreement.

Firstly, there is need for a summing-up of what has been
said, a résumé, a conclusion, as you yourself have already
pointed out. Secondly, in connection with this, a rewording
of some passages and a shortening of the rest of the article
(whose total length must not exceed 1 printed sheet) are
desirable (for example, the following passages might be
cut down: p. 3 [N.B. 2]; p. 39 [N.B. 16] and some others).
It seems to us that the rewording should consist in the
following: the whole form of the article has become something
of a challenge (“open letter”, the official form of address,
etc.), and this is hardly desirable. You yourself pointed
out some of the extremes in the present polemics (“Mr. 
G.’s
stalwarts”,[3] and similar things) and you were quite
right; but since these extremes were there, we should now
be more careful—not in the sense of conceding one iota
of principle, but in the sense of refraining from needlessly
embittering those who are working for Social-Democracy
within the limits of their understanding. Perhaps a

    

criticism of the Rabocheye Dyelo programme in the third
person would be better in this respect?

For the same reasons it would be appropriate to make
some “allowance” for the formal side of the Rabocheye
Dyelo programme. After all, it is not the programme of a
party, nor even the draft programme of a party, so that it is
incorrect to compare it with the programmes of the French
and German Social-Democrats (at any rate, when such a
comparison is made without reservations, as it is on your p. 42
[N.B. 17]). The criticism of the formal side of the programme
could be abbreviated (you yourself expressed the desire,
on p. 2, to “leave aside” the formal defects), reducing the
formal shortcomings, as particular cases, to the general
defect of the programme in principle. We think that such
an alteration is desirable with respect to the critical
remarks on pp. 45 (N.B. 20), 39 (N.B. 16), 20 (N.B. 9) and 6
(N.B. 6). The brusque formulation of these remarks here and
there might give the people occasion to speak (and not
entirely without foundation) of faultfinding. The superfluous
(from the strictly theoretical standpoint) reminder of the
need to reckon with local conditions, etc., could be the
result, not of the editorial board having failed to master
scientific socialism, but of its wishing to emphasise this
quite obvious point just at this moment, when it saw the
need to do so. And is there not sometimes a need to stress
even self-evident things? We do not deny at all that, in the
present case, 75 per cent—only 75 per cent—of the “need”
boiled down to the “need” of bowing and scraping before
Rabochaya Mysl. If we forget about the remaining 25 per
cent, we shall give the people a chance to accuse us of
faultfinding, whereas if we reduce these formal defects, as 
particular instances, to the general defect of principle, we shall
take the faultfinding edge off our remarks and reinforce
our line of argument.

Now a few more detailed remarks:

P. 17 (N.B. 8), footnote 1. The remark “What does this
dream augur?” is obscure.

P. 24 (N.B. 11). You cannot say that Social-Democracy
“is little concerned about whether its demands are
attainable”. We understand your idea and accept it, but it should
be expressed with greater care and precision; “cannot make

    

the immediate possibility of attainment the supreme test”
would indicate the road that needs to be taken, not the
possibility of early practical success, or something of that
sort.

P. 32 (N.B. 13)—“to use its own expression”: isn’t that
too strong?

P. 33 (N.B. 14)—“to seize, etc.”: an awkward,
incautious expression, because of the word “seize”.

P. 35 (footnote 
in fine[1]

).

(N.B. 15.)

“Gendarmes” and so forth. Would it not be better to
strike out or change this?

P. 43 (N.B. 18). Too strong. “Peasantry” is a term we
cannot eschew.

P. 44 (N.B. 19). Too strong and blunt. The question of
what the peasantry can provide is still far from settled by
the Russian Social-Democrats (compare the footnote to the
1885 Programme of the Emancipation of Labour
group[4]),
and is hardly likely to be decided in the sense that the
political role of the peasants is equal to zero (cf. Der 18.
Brumaire[5]).

I hope to have a letter from you in reply to this, and
not a letter alone, but the article as well (preferably not
later than in 2 weeks’ time, 3 weeks at the outside).

G. V. has looked through the article and has also decided
in favour of it, noting only the passage on p. 24 (about
the possibility of attainment).

P.S. The “we” in this letter are those with whom you had
a talk at
Bellerive.[6] We do not undertake as yet to speak
for the whole editorial board with complete certainty, but
hope this will not produce any unpleasant consequences
either for you or for us.

A review of D. B. Ryazanov’s article, “Remarks on the Rabocheye
Dyelo Programme”, sent in by Steklov. The article was published
in the journal Zarya (Dawn) No. 1, April 1901.

“The Rabocheye Dyelo Programme” (“Editorial Note”) was
issued in Rabocheye Dyelo No. 1 in April 1899 and published
separately that same year under the title “Programme of 
Rabocheye Dyelo, a periodical organ of the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats”.

Rabocheye Dyelo (The Workers’ Cause)—a magazine of the
Economists, and an organ of the Union of Russian Social–
Democrats Abroad, published in Geneva from April 1899 to February
1902 and edited by B. N. Krichevsky, A. S. Martynov and V. P.
Ivanshin.

A criticism of the views of Rabocheye Dyelo group is given
in Lenin’s What Is To Be Done? (See present edition, Vol. 5,
pp. 347–529.)

Social-Democrats Abroad.

Dear Comrade,

We have received your letter, and hasten to reply.

If you consider the passing on of my words to G. as “
retribution”, as an unpleasant duty, then of course I must
withdraw my request. If you do not find it unpleasant,
please pass on my words on some suitable occasion, in a
conversation, not as a complaint but as a correction. At all
events, please bear in mind that I do not insist.

We are not displaying the “revolutionary 
Sotsial-Demokrat
organisation”[2] signboard: when we wrote to you
we emphasised that we were an independent literary
undertaking.[3]

Whether we shall have an “impossible” polemic is a
question we dealt with in our previous letter.

We have no intention whatever of forgoing personal
acquaintance with this or that ally, but see no useful
purpose in having special relations between the Literary
Group[4]
and the
Union[5] at the present time, because the Union’s
distrust of us can be dissipated, I repeat, only by our
publications, and any preliminary conversations would be
futile.

There has not been, and cannot be any question of “
considering the Literary Group’s attitude to the Union binding
upon you”.

If your refusal to participate is quite out of the question,
we are very glad not to have understood you quite
correctly, and hasten to send you an address to which all
material from Russia could be sent (the Rögner address given
you can be used only from abroad, and please don’t pass it
on to anyone else). Please inform us what you might

    

contribute to the journal and the newspaper, whether or not
you have anything ready and, if not, when you think you
could write.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The addressee is unknown.





[2]
Revolutionary Sotsial-Demokrat organisation was formed by the
members of the Emancipation of Labour group and their
supporters in May 1900, following the split of the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats Abroad at its Second Congress. In October
1901, on Lenin’s proposal, the revolutionary Sotsial-Demokrat
organisation united with the Iskra organisation abroad into the
League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad.





[3]
A reference to the newspaper Iskra.





[4]
The Literary Group, consisting of Lenin, L. Martov and A. N.
Potresov, was set up on Lenin’s initiative after his return from exile
in early 1900. Its main task and programme of action were to
organise an all-Russia political newspaper and unite the best
Social-Democratic forces around it.





[5]
Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad was set up in Geneva
in 1894 on the initiative of the Emancipation of Labour group.
It had its own printing press for issuing revolutionary literature,
and published the journal Rabotnik (Worker). Initially, the
Emancipation of Labour group directed the Union and edited
its publications. But afterwards opportunist elements (“the young”
or Economists) gained the upper hand within the Union. At the
Union’s first congress in November 1898, the Emancipation of
Labour group announced that it would no longer edit the Union’s
publications. The final break and the group’s withdrawal from
the Union took place at the Union’s second congress in April
1900; the Emancipation of Labour group and its followers walked
out of the congress and set up an independent organisation,
Sotsial-Demokrat.

October 10, 1900

Dear P. B.,

I have received your letter with the enclosures. Thanks
for these.

About the English journal (there were two messages in it)
my
sister[1] says that she doesn’t remember the title exactly
—something like Family
Pictures[2]—a yellow cover with
red drawings, an illustrated journal, somewhat larger than
Neue
Zeit,[3] about 10 sheets; she says she gave it to you,
in the presence of your wife, to pass on to me.

Alexei is well, writing, busy organising contacts. He
will be free in six or eight weeks, hardly earlier. My
brother[4] is still here, keeps putting it off.

The statement will be ready in a few days, and I shall
of course send it on to
you.[5] There is already plenty of
copy for the paper; only a pity that it’s mostly highly
specific workers’ stuff, strikes and strikes, and descriptions
of the workers’ condition. Nothing at all on internal
questions.

Dietz has undertaken to publish the journal for us. The
type has been bought, but there is still no responsible
editor[6]: one arrangement has fallen through, but there
are others in view. If we fail to find a responsible editor,
we shall move the printing press elsewhere.

How is your health? Do you manage to do any work?
I suppose Paris has completely worn you out? Let us know
about the article on
Liebknecht[7] for the journal and for
the paper—how do matters stand, and when can we expect
to have it?
 

I shake you warmly by the hand, and wish you the best
of health and more free time.

Yours,
 Petroff

Here is the best address:

Herrn Dr. Med. Carl Lehmann,
Gabelsbergerstrasse 20a, München.

Inside, on the second envelope: for Petrov.

(Excuse the scribble!)

P.S. We have just had a letter from Nakhamkis, from
which it appears that there has been a misunderstanding
about the subject of the Paris
congresses.[8] You asked
Gurevich to write, and of course this was very good.
Koltsov wrote to tell us that he intended to deal with
the same subject, and even informed Nakhamkis that we
had “commissioned” him to write about it, which was not
actually the case. Would you write to Koltsov suggesting
that he should rather take up some other subject? Will
you do this, please, since we don’t know exactly where
he is at present. We are writing to tell Nakhamkis that
he and Gurevich should divide this work between them.
 

Notes

Family Pictures—a journal which was used for the secret
transmission of reports or articles for Iskra.





[3]
Die Neue Zeit—a theoretical journal of the German
Social-Democratic Party, published in Stuttgart from 1883 to 1923. Up
to October 1917, it was edited by K. Kautsky and then by
Heinrich Cunow.





[4]
A reference to A. N. Potresov.





[5]
A reference to the draft declaration of the Editorial Board of
Iskra on the publication of a newspaper. It was drawn up by Lenin
in late March and early April 1900 (see present edition, Vol. 4,
pp. 320–30). The draft was rewritten by Lenin when he arrived
abroad, after the August 1900 conference with members of the
Emancipation of Labour group (G. V. Plekhanov, P. B.
Axelrod, and V. I. Zasulich). In the first half of October, the
declaration was published as a leaflet (ibid., pp. 351–56).


In contrast to the original draft, which set forth a programme
for the two organs—newspaper and journal—the declaration
issued by the Iskra editors concerned only the newspaper, it having
been decided that the tasks of the journal Zarya would be dealt
with separately, in its first issue. For reasons of secrecy it was
decided not to circulate the declaration abroad until it reached
Russia.





[6]
A reference to the Marxist scientific and political journal Zarya and
its “responsible editor” as required by German press laws.





[7]
A reference to P. B. Axelrod’s article, “Wilhelm Liebknecht”,
carried in Iskra No. 1. Apart from this short article on the death
of the prominent leader of the German and international
working-class movement, Axelrod was also writing a long article for
Zarya, which, however, was not published.





[8]
A reference to the congress of the Second International and the
congress of the French Socialist Party held in Paris in
September 1900. Neither Iskra nor Zarya carried E. L. Gurevich’s or
Y. M. Steklov’s article on the subject.

October 18, 1900

Dear P. B.,

I received your long and kind letter of Oct. 15 yesterday.
Many thanks for it. We were very glad to learn that you
are better, and that you can get on with your work. Your
article for the paper is being copied already! You are
outstripping us: we are still unable to get organised to
have someone copy out all the things that have to be sent
off.
Zagorskaya[2] has still not arrived, while the stuff to
be copied keeps piling up. Sometimes I feel quite exhausted
and out of touch with my real work.

I did not quite understand your hint about the
impending “trouble” with the
Parisians.[3] Of course it would be
terribly difficult for you to write about everything; but
perhaps you will pass on the substance of it to Vera
Ivanovna, who, we hope, will soon be coming here?

We still have no responsible editor.... The statement
has been prepared and sent to Russia (I will soon send you
a copy), and before long it will be possible to begin setting
up the paper. We intend to publish a long report, “May
Day Demonstrations in Kharkov ” (about 50,000 letters and
spaces), as a separate
pamphlet,[4] and to print only a very
brief extract in the newspaper; after all, we cannot take
up three-quarters of a sheet with a single article! (The
newspaper will have 3 columns a page, approximately 6,000
letters each, or, to be more precise, “letters and spaces”.)
(We intend the first issue to have 2 sheets, 8 pages.) What
do you think?

Thanks for the advice on correspondents’ reports. We
shall certainly try to make use of it, because that would,
of course, only improve the make-up of the
paper.[5]
 

I quite agree with your view of my brother’s journey.
What can one do with him? We are constantly receiving
warnings from every side—both from Paris (that people
arriving from Russia mention us all three by name), and
from Russia (that I was traced on my way
here,[6] and that
in one provincial town they arrested a perfectly innocent
man, a distant relative, who had never seen me in his life,
and asked him what instructions I had given him!)—and
I am doing my utmost to persuade my brother either not
to go, or to go for a fortnight all told; I keep arguing with
him, ridiculing him, abusing him (I have never abused him
so violently)—but nothing seems to have any effect: he
keeps saying he wants to go home! And now he has brought
matters to the point of the statement being sent to Russia,
which means (if the statement arrives, and that is certain)
a direct indication of the new literary undertaking. After
all, there’s not much longer to wait before Alexei arrives,
surely? My “opponent” is about to arrive, and I will give
him this to read—let him “refute” it, if he can do so
without a twinge of conscience!

We are both quite well, but very edgy: the main thing
is this agonising
uncertainty[7]; these German rascals keep
putting us off daily with “tomorrows”. What I could do
to them!

Yes, I quite forgot (please be so kind as to forgive the
hasty tone of this letter!)—we have already had
negotiations with Buchholtz but he refused, refused flatly. He
is pressing upon us a 
Vermittlerrolle,[1]

and won’t budge!

My very best wishes, and greetings to all your family.

Yours,
 Petrov

Zagorskaya has just arrived. I will be seeing her
tomorrow.
 

Notes
 

[1]
The role of intermediary.—Ed.
 



[2]
Zagorskaya (I. G. Smidovich-Lehmann) was the secretary of
Iskra’s editorial office until the arrival of N. K. Krupskaya
in April 1901.





[3]
The Parisians (D. B. Ryazanov, Y. M. Steklov, E. L. Gurevich)—
representatives of the Borba literary group abroad. Lenin called
them “Parisians” because they then lived in that city.

In his letter to Axelrod Lenin apparently refers to the
difficulties in the talks with them concerning their work on Iskra on a
permanent basis, in view of their claims for a say in editorial
policy (see pp. 67–68, 69–70).





[4]
The pamphlet was compiled by the Kharkov Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. and published in January 1901 by Iskra. It described
the first mass demonstration by Kharkov workers on May Day
in 1900. It appeared abroad with a preface by Lenin (see present
edition, Vol. 4, pp. 357–65).





[5]
Axelrod’s advice in his letter to Lenin of October 15, 1900, dealt
with the editing of letters from Russia for Iskra. His idea was
to make use of some letters together with other material for
domestic reviews or editorials (see Lenin Miscellany III, p. 66).





[6]
The police were very eager to know the whereabouts of Lenin,
and, in general, of the whole group which subsequently
constituted Iskra’s Editorial Board. Obzor zhandarmskikh doznany
za 1901 god (Review of Gendarme Investigations for 1901) stated
that Lenin was living in Munich and working for Iskra. The police
also knew that A. N. Potresov was in Munich. In the

   

circumstances, Potresov’s trip to Russia mentioned in the letter was a
hazardous undertaking.

October 19

Dear P. B.,

A short P.S. to yesterday’s letter, so as not to make
you answer questions which have turned out to be 
erledigt.[1]


We have just received the Parisians’ letters, and at once
understood what I wrote to you yesterday that I had not
quite
understood[2]

:

namely, your warning to be “wise as
serpents” (easier said than done!) and to keep away from
the “émigrés”. The tone of the letters is such that it serves
as an excellent commentary on your remark, which is now
quite clear to me.

Yours,
 Petrov

October 21, 1900

Dear P. B.,

I saw Zagorskaya only yesterday; she passed on to me
something from you.

Please send us the article (on Liebknecht) as soon as
it is copied out. From what Zagorskaya said I could not
get an idea of the exact size of the article, but size is,
after all, not the main consideration: we can always make
room, and it will always be a pleasure to do so, for your
article.

As regards the lady from Paris who is going to South
Russia in a month’s time, and wants recommendations. I
think the best thing to do is to introduce her to my sister,
who is now in Paris and will be staying there another three
weeks, if not more. If you agree with this plan, let us know
this lady’s name and address, and also write some little
note to present to her on your behalf (if that should be
necessary). Send it either to me, or to my sister (103 Rue
de la Glacière. M-lle Loukachevitsch, Paris. For Blank).

I hear that you have sent a cushion and an English
journal over here. To what address, and for whom, if it was
marked 
postlagernd[1]

?

Zagorskaya could tell me nothing
about this.

All the very best,
 Yours,
 Petrov
 

P.S. I enclose a copy of our statement for
America.[2]
We don’t want to circulate it here—at any rate, certainly
not until it has appeared in Russia in sufficient quantities
(and we have had no news yet from Russia about this).
We have thought, therefore, of sending the statement at
present only to you and to G. V., but if you think it 
essential to send it to America without waiting for news from
Russia, then of course do so.

Yours,
Petrov

The statement on Iskra’s publication whose draft and final text
were written by Lenin (see present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 320–30,
351–56). The idea was to send it to the Russian Social-Democratic
Society in New York of which S. M. Ingerman was secretary (see
p. 46).

November 2, 1900

Please forgive me, dear Novosyolov, that I am so
disgracefully late with my reply to your letter of October 
17. I was constantly distracted by “petty” matters and
chores here, and was also waiting for a reply from Alexei.
It was essential to wait for a reply, in order to clear up
the question of our editorial statement. Alexei has decided
not to circulate it at present. Therefore, in sending you
a copy, I beg you to keep it secret for the time being, and
not to show it to anyone (apart perhaps from that close
friend of yours who has authority from the St. Petersburg
group, and about whom you
write[1]) and, in any,case,
not let it pass into anyone else’s hands. In general, we
have decided not to circulate this thing abroad until it
has been distributed in Russia, and since Alexei is holding
it back over there, it is particularly important for us to
see that it does not spread out here. Counting on your close
participation in our undertaking, I decided to make an
exception and to acquaint you with the statement. When
reading it please bear in mind that the intention is to
publish both a paper and a journal (or a miscellany); but the
statement says nothing about the latter for certain special
reasons connected with the plan for publishing the
journal.[2] Therefore, some passages of the statement should
be read as applying not only to the paper.

Please write and tell me what impression the statement
has made on you and your friend.

What type of “agitation journal” do the members of the
Rabocheye Znamya group propose to publish (it was about
them you wrote, wasn’t it?)? What kind of journal is it
to be, and who is to work on it?
 

As regards shipment across the frontier into Russia,
I think this will always be easily done: we have connections
with several groups who carry on such transport, and in
addition a member of our group was recently given a promise
(a solid one, judging by everything) that they would be
able to take anyone across the frontier into Russia without
a passport. This, I think, is easily arranged.

The Russian passport business is much worse. So far
there is nothing, and the “prospects” are still very
indefinite. Perhaps this too will be arranged by the spring.

I shall probably be staying on here for a fairly long time,
and our correspondence can therefore continue without
inconvenience.

You ask what work we should like to request you to take
on. I think that (by the spring or by the autumn, whenever
you intend to move) the following work will be of especial
importance for us:
(1) transport of literature across the
frontier;
(2) delivery throughout Russia;
(3) organisation
of workers’ groups to circulate the paper and collect
information, etc., i.e., in general, organisation of the
circulation of the paper and of close and proper connections
between it and individual committees and groups. We pin
great hopes on your co-operation, particularly in the
business of direct contacts with the workers in various
places. Does such work appeal to you? Have you anything
against travelling? It would probably require constant travels.

Is the St. Petersburg group, from which your friend has
authority, still in existence? If so, could he provide
addresses for contacts in St. Petersburg and a password, in
order to transmit our statement to them? Have they any
connections with the workers in general, and the St. 
Petersburg Workers’ Organisation in
particular[3]?

All the best, and I wish you the speediest and easiest
emergence from quarantine abroad.

Yours,
 Petroff

P.S. Have I written the address correctly?

Please confirm receipt of this letter.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
St. Petersburg group—the Rabocheye Znamya group emerged in
the second half of 1897. It took a negative attitude to
Economism. It set itself the aim of conducting political propaganda
among the workers and published the newspaper Rabocheye
Znamya (Workers’ Banner), of which three issues appeared. It also
published several pamphlets and proclamations. Among its
leaders were S. V. Andropov, V. P. Nogin and M. B. Smirnov. In
January 1901, the St. Petersburg Rabocheye Znamya group merged
with the Sotsialist group, but from January to April those
leaders of the united group who were in Russia were arrested.
Most of the members of the St. Petersburg Rabocheye Znamya
group joined the Iskra organisation.

Lenin refers to S. V. Andropov, a Social-Democrat and an
active member of the Rabocheye Znamya group, subsequently
one of Iskra’s first agents.





[2]
The “special reasons” meaning the need for secrecy. J. H. W.
Dietz, at whose printing press in Stuttgart the journal Zarya
was printed, feared harassment by the police in the event they
found out that the journal was in some way connected with the
illegal Iskra. Iskra was then printed in Leipzig.





[3]
St. Petersburg Workers’ Organisation—an Economist
organisation set up in the summer of 1900. Its appeal “To the Workers
of All Factories”, published in its newspaper Rabochaya Mysl
(Workers’ Thought) No. 9, September 1900, called on the workers
to organise circles for the working out of a programme of struggle
and for mutual assistance. In the autumn of 1900, the Workers’
Organisation merged with the St. Petersburg League of Struggle
for the Emancipation of the Working Class. The programme and
charter of this united organisation were carried in Rabochaya Mysl
No. 11 in April 1901.

Following the victory of the Iskra trend within the St. 
Petersburg Committee and its recognition of the newspaper Iskra and
the journal Zarya as the leading Social-Democratic organs, a section
of the St. Petersburg organisation under the influence and
leadership of the proponents of Economism split off from the
St. Petersburg Committee in September 1902 and once again
formed a separate organisation called the Committee for Workers’

   

Organisation, which rejoined the Party organisation after the
Second Congress of the Party in early 1904.

November 3

I received your letter yesterday, dear P. B., and have
today already sent off the note to my sister. I have not
passed on the letter to V. I.

Before I forget: please, let me know to whom the cushion
and the English book you sent here were addressed. I have
not yet received them. If you sent them postlagernd, was
it the ordinary postlagernd or 
Bahnhofpostlagernd,[1]

or
some other way? V. I. could not tell me, and I have been
waiting for your letter all this time, but there is no
mention of this in it. Since I don’t know the name in the
address, I cannot make inquiries. Please, ask Vera Pavlovna
to drop me a line about this, and kindly forgive me for
worrying you again and again with these trifles.

As regards the article on Liebknecht, truly we don’t
know what to do. Your article turned out to be long enough
for the journal: 8 pages (according to V. I., similar to those
in Nakanune[2] in small type, i.e., about 8,000 letters per
page)—this makes 64,000 letters, and even if we take 
Nakanune’s larger type, it will come to about 50,000 letters]
Our paper will have the Vorwärts format, also in three
columns. Each column of about 6,000 letters, which means
that half your article will take up an entire page of the
newspaper, plus another column! This is extremely
inconvenient for the paper, apart from the inconvenience of
dividing up such an article as yours about Liebknecht.

I will calculate all this more precisely when your
article arrives. We shall do our best to carry it, but if this
proves to be impossible because of the size, will you be

    

so good as to allow us to publish it as a pamphlet
supplement to the paper (if you are writing about Liebknecht
separately for the journal)? We are now setting up the May
Day Demonstrations in Kharkov pamphlet (50,000 letters);
then will come the turn of the paper, and then of your
pamphlet about Liebknecht; if it proves necessary, an obituary
could be written for the paper, with a reference to the
pamphlet. What do you think of that?

I repeat that all this is mere supposition; it is essential
to make an exact calculation, and when I do this, on
receipt of your article, I will write to you at once.

I wish you all the best, and particularly that you should
get well again as soon as possible. Kindest regards to
your family.

Yours,
 Petrov

November 8

Dear P. B.,

I have received your letter of the 5th and the
article.[2]
Many thanks. The alterations probably involved a great
deal of work and must have caused even more annoyance,
because condensing such a subject must be extremely
uninteresting work. It is all the more valuable to us that you
undertook to do it. Please excuse us for not sending you
the articles: our “secretary” is, unfortunately, burdened
with serious family duties, and therefore the copying
proceeds very slowly. I enclose an article, “New Friends of
the Russian Proletariat”, which we want to publish in
No. 1 as a
feature.[3] Please let us know your opinion (you
can pencil it on the article) and then be kind enough to
send it onto G. V.

As regards the Parisians, we decided on the very tactics
you advised: on the one hand, “not to arm”, and on the
other, “to abstain”. Of course, they are dissatisfied with
our abstention and we were recently obliged (of necessity)
to give such a rebuff to their expression of dissatisfaction
that we feared a “cooling-off” (feared is not quite the right
word, because we decided to give this rebuff even if it
should inevitably lead to a rupture). Yesterday, we received
a reply from the “secretary” of the group they have formed
in
Paris[4]; judging by the reply, our rebuff has had no
harmful consequences, and “all is well”. Let’s hope that
this will continue to be so in the future. It is quite true
that later on we shall probably have to think of the “rules”
and the other pleasant and interesting things you mention;

    

but it was a master-stroke on your part to have set
approximately six months for this. It would be premature so
long as the undertaking is not “in full working order”;
we are completely in agreement with you in this respect.

But I cannot agree with you about beginning to appear
here openly. I cannot as yet think that “legality has
already been lost”. To my mind, it has not yet been lost,
and this “yet” may last another few months, during which
time much will be clarified. (My brother is already in
Russia, and so far all is well. The
traveller[5] is also wandering
successfully, so far.) And even if there were a complete
and final loss of legality, there might be weighty
considerations against coming out openly (for example,
considerations about journeys home). Therefore, until the first
issues have appeared, and until all of us (including Alexei
and my brother) get together, I shall, in any case, remain
in hiding. If the undertaking is destined to be a success,
this decision may soon change, but my earlier “optimism”
about this condition has been thoroughly shaken by “the
humdrum of
life”.[6]

As regards the journal, it will soon be clear, I suppose,
whether we shall organise it here or seek refuge in other
countries. As soon as this is cleared up, I shall let you know.

I find it very inconvenient to write to America, for after
all I know no one there, and no one there knows me, and
all the same it will be necessary to use you as an
intermediary. Would it not, therefore, be better for you to write
direct, and to send the statement, informing them that it
comes from a Russian group, stating your attitude to this
group and saying that a pamphlet, May Day
Demonstrations in Kharkov, is now being set at the same printing press,
and that when it is finished the paper will be set; that the
statement says nothing about a journal (or a miscellany)
for technical reasons of secrecy, but that for No. 1 there
are being written (or are ready) such-and-such articles by
G. V., yourself and Kautsky (
Erinnerungen[1]

,

an
interesting piece which V. I. is already translating), and others.
It seems to me that all the aims you mention will be attained
much better and much more directly by your letter,

    

while your dispatch of the statement to America no longer
entails (I think) any undesirable publicity, particularly
the sending of one copy for the secretary of the society there
to read out at its
meeting.[7]

All best wishes,
 Yours,
 Petroff

P.S. I have received the cushion and the book.

the “unity” conference. The group’s publications distorted
Marxist theory, rejected Iskra’s revolutionary tactics and took a
hostile attitude to Lenin’s organisational principles of party
building. In view of these departures from Social-Democratic
views and tactics, its splitting activities and lack of contact with
Social-Democratic organisations in Russia, the group was not
allowed to attend the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. and was
dissolved by its decision.

During preparations for the publication of Iskra, differences
on the place of publication arose between Lenin and A. N.
Potresov, on the one hand, and G. V. Plekhanov and P. B. Axelrod,
on the other. The latter opposed Iskra’s publication in Germany
and wanted to have it issued in Switzerland, under their immediate
direction. Lenin and Potresov opposed this. Following the
conference in Corsier (near Geneva) in August 1900 with members of
the Emancipation of Labour group, Lenin and Potresov decided
that in the interest of the cause Iskra and Zarya =

should be published
in Germany. The essence of these differences of principle was
described by Lenin in “How the ‘Spark’ Was Nearly Extinguished ”
(see present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 333–49). Lenin and Potresov won
out and the publication of Iskra was started in Germany, initially
in Leipzig and then in Munich. Zarya was published legally in
Stuttgart.

November 9

I received your letter today, dear Georgi Valentinovich,
and at once sent you by registered book-post
(1) the article
“What Has Happened?” by Puttman;
(2) the article by
Byvaly, and
(3) the article by D. Koltsov about the Paris
Congress.[4]

Vera Ivanovna found this last article quite
unacceptable and I entirely agree with her. The article is
uninteresting, quite unsuitable for the journal (especially since you
will be writing about
Millerand[5]) and much too long for
the paper. It contains 22,000–27,000 letters, whereas for
the paper we need an item of 6,000-9,000 letters or only
a little more. We would therefore like to ask Rakovsky
to write an article of that size for the paper, and to reject
Koltsov’s article. We decided to send it on to you, all the
more since you were going to reply to Rakovsky. So do
as you find most appropriate—either reject Koltsov’s
article and order one from Rakovsky, or request Koltsov
to rewrite and shorten the article, under your guidance.
It seems to us more probable that you will choose the first
alternative, and in that case you can of course refer to us
when informing Koltsov, and we can write to him
ourselves as soon as we get your reply.

I am sending the article by Byvaly for polishing up and
insertion of some corrections which you indicated. Of
course you may make corrections: please do so with all the
articles, either making them in pencil right in the
manuscript or on separate sheets. I can, if you like, write to
Byvaly afterwards about these corrections—he is not likely

    

to take a rigid stand, but if he does, we shall have to
discuss the matter and make a choice: whether or not to take
the whole as it is. The only thing I cannot agree with you
on at all is the suggestion to cut out the mention of
Bakharev’s
pamphlet,[6] and this not so much because it would
be extremely unpleasant for the author, as because I, too,
consider Bakharev’s pamphlet useful (in spite of its
defects), for it raises a really important point and, on the whole,
deals with it correctly. Byvaly writes not only about the
old but also about the new; if serious revolutionaries had
no need of such pamphlets in the 1870s, we nowadays
certainly have need of them, and we had the firm intention
to print a critical but approving note about it (possibly
in the paper, but not in No. 1). The fact that quite young
workers and intellectuals are being drawn into the mass
movement, who have almost completely forgotten, or
rather have no knowledge of what used to happen in the old
days and how, and the absence of organisation of “
experienced” revolutionaries—all this makes it necessary to
publish pamphlets about rules of behaviour for socialists.
The Poles have such a
pamphlet,[7] which seems to give
a great deal more than Bakharev’s does. Vera Ivanovna
agrees that the mention of Bakharev should not be cut out.
In certain conditions, if you think it useful, a discussion
in the journal on the question of the possible importance of
such pamphlets might perhaps not be altogether irrelevant.
We intend Byvaly’s article for the journal and not the
paper. Vera Ivanovna says that our paper turns out to be
at a lower level, in terms of the readers for whom it is
intended, than you probably imagine. Vera Ivanovna is on
the whole rather dissatisfied with the paper: she says it
is of the Rabocheye Dyelo type, only somewhat more
literary, more brushed up. I have sent one article to
Pavel Borisovich, asking him to send it on to you. It would
be quite inconvenient to have the question of Kautsky’s
resolution shortened and abridged to the size of a newspaper
article and that is why we should like the journal to carry
an article or item on this question by you. Or perhaps you
intend to confine yourself to something very small?
Probably even an item on this subject will require about 10
printed pages, i.e., about 20,000 letters, if not more?
 

I must say that I thought you would be willing to write
an item about Solovyov. Puttman is hardly likely to take
it on. I shall write to him, but I am not very hopeful.

Vera Ivanovna is prepared to write about the
Decembrists,[8] but what about the material? We shall write
immediately to have them send us what they can. Perhaps you
too will suggest what it would be particularly important
to have for this work. I think the most important thing
is the historical journals, which are not available
here.

Gurevich is writing a big article for the journal on French
affairs, and for the newspaper on the national congress.
Goldendakh or Nakhamkis was going to write about the
International Congress, but did not.

Please send us your article, “Socialism and the Political
Struggle” (it can be sent by registered book-post to the
same address of Lehmann); I doubt that Alexei would not
like the article because of the comradely criticism, for I
remember him telling me that he found the objections of
Pavel Borisovich to be justified.

We shall number the separate sheets (unless they have
been numbered already) and I don’t think the compositors
will lose anything; after all, they always have to deal with
separate sheets, and the same applies to our paper, and
so far they have never lost anything. The question of “
responsible editor” will evidently be settled favourably, I
think, tomorrow or the day after (today I received news
that two have agreed, and am expecting vital information
tomorrow). We think that all the same we shall not manage
(initially, at least) without the help of Blumenfeld, whom
Dietz has agreed to take on as a compositor, and who would
put the thing on its feet for us, train the Germans, etc. As
soon as all this is finally cleared up, I shall write or
telegraph to him at once. But I should very much like to
have your article, “Once More”,
etc.,[9] as soon as possible,
because we might have to send it for setting immediately.

Against Rabochaya Mysl—more precisely, only against
the article “Our Reality” in the Separate Supplement—
I had an article, “The Retrograde Movement in Russian
Social-Democracy”,[10] written as far back as a year ago. It
has now been sent here to me, and I am thinking of rewriting

    

it for the journal, with additional material directed against
Rabocheye Dyelo.

I don’t quite understand to which “latest No.” of 
Rabochaya Mysl you refer. No. 8 was the last issue of the paper
(a new editorial board “from page 5”), which, incidentally,
carries a repudiation of the famous parallels at the end
of the article on Chernyshevsky in the Separate Supplement.
Is that what you have in mind?

I would think the item, “To What Lengths They Have
Gone”,[11] a useful one, though now I doubt the “
belligerency” of Rabochaya Mysl: they nevertheless want to take
a few steps “towards us” (passez moi le
mot[1]

),

and we ought
to try to consider them 
verbesserungsfähig.[2]

But of course
there should be an attack in any case: they won’t change
unless attacked. I have been corresponding lately with
Vetrinskaya, an old comrade of mine in the
League,[12]
and told her that I supported Alexei’s words: “We shall
have to wrestle with you.” Go ahead, if you are not ashamed,
she told Alexei. I wrote to say that I was not in the
least ashamed.

I should also like to have a talk with you about the
economic trend and Alexei’s views, but it is already very
late, and I will confine myself to a few words. The
economic trend, of course, was always a mistake, but then it
is very young, while there has been overemphasis of “
economic” agitation (and there still is here and there) even
without the trend, and it was the legitimate and inevitable
companion of any step forward in the conditions of our
movement which existed in Russia at the end of the 1880s
or the beginning of the 1890s. The situation then was so
murderous that you cannot probably even imagine it, and
one should not censure people who stumbled as they
clambered up out of that situation. For the purposes of this
clambering out, some narrowness was essential and legitimate:
was, I say, for with this tendency to blow it up into a
theory and tie it in with Bernsteinism, the whole thing of
course changed radically. But that the overemphasis of “
economic” agitation and catering to the “mass” movement

    

were natural, you too, unless I’m mistaken, recognised
in “The New Campaign” written in 1896, when
Vilna
Economism[13] was already à l’ordre du
jour,[3]

while St. 
Petersburg economism was emerging and taking shape.

Every good wish, and please excuse the disorderly
writing.

Yours,
 Petroff

November 16

I have just received, dear P. B., your remarks on the
article “The Urgent
Tasks”.[1] Many thanks. What do you
think about the unpopularity of this article? It won’t sound
discordant, will it?

I enclose the preface to the pamphlet May Day
Demonstrations in Kharkov (some, but very small, corrections
were made in the manuscript you have). Please, let’s hear
what you think of it, and do not hesitate to make your
remarks on it, in ink or in pencil.

I am also sending you a document received from Russia
about the amalgamation of the St. Petersburg Workers’
Organisation and the League of
Struggle.[2] They say the
St. Petersburg people are terribly proud of it, and Kiev
is said to have adopted the programme already. It must be
written about. Would you like to do so? (After reading
this “document”—this “specimen”, as my brother calls
it—please send it on to G. V., if you don’t need it.)

We have at last found a responsible editor. Ettinger has
undertaken to sign two numbers in any case, giving up
all claims about the “tone”, etc., and reserving the right
after these two issues to make a statement in the press about
her disagreement with the content, and so forth. Let us
hope that she will keep to this condition (she only asks very
earnestly that we should say nothing about it to anyone
until publication), and in the meantime we shall either
find someone else, or make other
arrangements.[3] I
personally negotiated with Ettinger with the aid of
Buchholtz, who resigned from the Union for the purpose of taking

    

some steps in the spirit of conciliation. I shall write in more
detail about these steps later, considering that there is
little of interest in them.

We now hope to begin setting in a few days.

With all good wishes,
 Yours,
 Petroff

A reference to the Programme of the St. Petersburg League of
Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class and the

November 19, 1900

Dear P. B.,

I have just received your letter of November 17, and
read your remarks with great interest. Of course we shall
try without fail to send you as many articles as possible,
as this is valuable for the publications in all respects, quite
apart from your natural interest in them. One thing we
are sorry about is that our secretary is
überarbeitet[1]

;

but
this will change soon all the same, because serious reforms
are afoot in the matter of
Kinderpflege.[2]
[3]


Danevich has sent in an item of about 12,000 letters
for the paper, on the French national congress; I hesitate
to say whether it is entirely suitable. Very possibly we
shall manage without it if we have your chronicle of events,
which we are awaiting impatiently. Danevich is writing
a big article on French affairs for the
journal.[4]

The enclosed letter is for Rolau: my colleague is writing
to him about our “tea” business, because we think that
my correspondent Skubiks is not in
town.[5] Please be good
enough to pass this letter on to Rolau, and ask him to reply
to us at once (forgive me for troubling you with such a
request: I hope you can entrust, say, Gurevich with this).
But if Rolau is not in town, would you be so kind as to
read the letter addressed to him, and have a talk about
its matter, if only with Skubiks’s wife. The thing is that

    

we must have a definite reply as soon as possible, and if
neither Rolau nor Skubiks is available, this can’t be done
otherwise than by a personal talk between you and someone
of their company.

As regards the article by
L. Axelrod,[6] I quite agree
with you that it should first of all be sent to G. V.

Every good wish, and excuse this too hasty letter.

Yours,
 Petrov

[4]
There was no article in Iskra No. 1 on French affairs by Danevich
(E. L. Gurevich). His first article, “Letters from France. Letter
One”, appeared in Iskra No. 6 in July 1901. No articles by
Danevich on the subject were carried by Zarya.





[5]
A reference to the transportation of Iskra literature to Russia
via the Baltic provinces, which was undertaken by Latvian
students, Ernests Rolau and Eduards Skubiks, who were then resident
in Zurich. It later turned out that the police had been aware of
the existence of this transportation group; both consignments
of Iskra publications organised by Rolau and Skubiks in December
1900 and June 1901 had been confiscated. Transportation was
finally organised in mid-1901.





[6]
A reference to the article by Lubov Axelrod (Orthodox), “Why
We Don’t Want to Go Back?” (on the book written by the liberal,
subsequently a reactionary, N. A. Berdayev, Subjectivism and
Individualism in Social Philosophy) carried in Zarya’s double
issue No. 2–3 in December 1901.

November 26, 1900

Dear P. B.,

I have just received a letter from our mutual friend,
who tells us that everything has been arranged. At last the
business will go forward “steadily”! He begs you to send
(me), as quickly as possible, the Nusperli
passport[1]

(or
Husperli? It is not clear, but you must know what is
meant).[2]

Tomorrow, November 27, he begins the setting, and
consequently we may hope that in two weeks’ time (or a
little more) everything will be quite ready. It is therefore
very important to have all the material available within
a week, including your foreign chronicle. I hope that this
date will not cause you to break off anything, for I suppose
most of it has been done. V. I. is writing to G. V. today,
asking him to hurry up the person who is writing about
the Paris
congress.[3] It is, of course, quite possible to make
references to his article (if you do make any) even before
the article arrives.

Wishes of all the best and of good health.

Yours,
 Petrov

P.S. I am this very day sending Dietz the manuscript
(by
G. V.).[4] I hope there, too, things will go ahead
decisively. High time!
 

Notes

A reference to I. S. Blumenfeld, then an Iskra compositor in
Leipzig.

Preparations for publishing Iskra and Zarya abroad were
assigned to A. N. Potresov, who went abroad for that purpose in
April 1900. With the assistance of German Social-Democrats,
the setting of Iskra was arranged in German Social-Democratic
printing presses first in Leipzig and then in Munich. Zarya was
published legally in Stuttgart by Dietz.

Blumenfeld apparently needed the Nusperli passport for
registration in Leipzig.

December 11 
 

Dear P. B.,

Thank you very much for letting us have your remarks
so speedily on the item about the
split.[3] I have made the
corrections you want, except that I could not cut out
altogether the mention of the Rabocheye Dyelo’s services:
it seems to me that this would be unfair to an opponent
with a record not only of offences against Social-Democracy.

Poletayev told me a piece of news that has made me
very glad, that you have to some extent got free of the
yoghurt, and could pay us a short visit. Now this would
be splendid! I think there will be no difficulty in finding
accommodation, one can take a room by the week. After
all you do have a Swiss citizen’s passport. I am still waiting
(still, because I have been waiting a long time already, and
to no purpose) the early arrival of both friends. Alexei
writes that he is “eager to come”, but is being somewhat
delayed by various circumstances. The other friend has
not written for a long time, but I don’t think this means
that anything very bad has happened. By the time they
arrive, both Iskra (in 1 or 2 weeks) and Zarya will probably
have appeared (Dietz has hired another compositor and
is driving ahead quickly, hurrying us up. By the way, will
you have anything for this issue of the
journal[1]

?).

By
that time, something will also have been cleared up about
the transport (what a difficult problem!) and about the

    

material, and then it would be extremely desirable to have
a general meeting. I look forward to this very much.

What about young Adler’s
article[4]? Is he writing it?
When will it be ready? Please hurry him up in a letter and
—if you find the correspondence too burdensome, or if the
Umweg[2]

via Munich—Zurich—Vienna entails long delay,
then give him Lehmann’s address (Herrn Dr. Med. Carl
Lehmann, Gabelsbergerstrasse 20a. München. On the second
envelope: für Meyer)—and give us his address, and we shall
squeeze a reply out of him.

We want to print 1,000 copies of Zarya for Russia and
500 for abroad.

I am eagerly awaiting your chronicle, and then a meeting.

Yours,
 Petroff

For Gurevich:

Please try and arrange the following: we need to have
a good address in Zurich through which Yefimov (Dietz’s
compositor) could carry on correspondence with Geneva,
i.e., an intermediary, transmitting address. If you can,
please send it to me as soon as possible, and in any case
drop me a line at least right away in reply.

My best wishes, and regards to Vera Pavlovna.

Yours,
 Petroff

Midnight, December 14, 1900

Dear P. B.,

Forgive me for having disturbed you unnecessarily with
my telegram. Not having received the article in the
morning, I inferred (after your telegram of yesterday) that
something had happened, and decided to inquire by
telegram, in particular under the influence of a desperate letter
from the printers. And then your article arrived a few hours
later! I hasten to inform you without delay of its arrival,
as you asked, and, once again, please excuse the telegram.
I am very, very glad that we shall soon see each other;
my “brother” will, I think, also arrive in a few days, and
Alexei too, possibly, in 2 or 3 weeks’ time.

There is still no article from Paris on the International
Congress—I have sent a telegram today.

I may have to go away for a short time before the paper
appears, in order to sort out various small items (we are
badly out in thousands of letters, and are now throwing out a
good deal!), but this will take 3 or 4 days, no more.

Let me know whether I should take a room for you, or
just have a preliminary look for one. I will ask V. I. about
your requirements, and will begin my search.

Forgive the brevity—I am very tired and in a hurry.

Very best regards,
 Yours,
 Petroff

December 24, 1900

Dear P. B.,

I returned from my business trip only
yesterday,[1] and
found your letter. The paper should be ready today; as soon
as I receive it I shall send it to you, unless you start out
yourself.

My brother arrives this evening.

Alexei will not get rid of his obstacles and leave before
Dec. 20 (O.S.).

I was quite unable to send the proofs—I myself could
not get them, and had to make the journey to sort things
out on p. 8. However unpleasant it was, I had to divide your
article, and hold up the second half for the next
issue,[2]
otherwise what was essential could not have gone in, on
account of the setting (for technical reasons) in bourgeois,
instead of brevier.

And so, from Vasilyev—? And from Adler—nothing?
You say nothing of Adler in your letter.

The journal is going forward: G. V. has sent in an article
on
Struve[3]—6 articles have been sent in all.

All the best, and I heartily wish you speedy recovery
from the influenza which is raging so everywhere this year.

Yours,
 Petroff

P.S. I have just learned from Gurevich’s letter that you
have received the article on Austria. That’s fine. Have

    

you a really good translator? If not, send us the article,
we shall translate it over here.

To Gurevich

Thanks for your information. Of course it would be
desirable to have details about the Riga comrade: what kind
of work would and could he take on? How free and
financially well off is he, etc.?

Please tell Skubiks that I got his letter, but did not
reply because I was away—and now can only say that
our man is already “there” and has an address, so that the
matter I was corresponding with Skubiks about is settled.

With best wishes,
 Petrov

January 3, 1901

Dear Comrade,

I have received Revolution and
Counter-Revolution,[2] and
am very grateful to you for sending this booklet. As regards
transport we cannot at this moment undertake any definite
obligations. Our routes are just now being arranged and
will evidently be arranged satisfactorily; but it remains
to be seen how they will function. In all probability we
shall be able to give you quite a definite reply in 2 or 3 weeks
at the outside, and will be happy to undertake the shipment
of your booklet, if we can. We know nothing of Max Menkus,
and are not doing our business through him. Your letters
and reports have been received. We have already used some
of them for the paper. Incidentally, the first issue should
be ready in a few days, and I shall then send you a
copy.[3]
We expect our Poltava friend to arrive here in the very near
future. All the best. Oh yes, there is also this. Having
learned that we have completed a translation of Kautsky’s
book, Bernstein and the Social-Democratic Programme, a
member of the Rabocheye Znamya group approached a
member of our group in Russia offering to publish the
translation.[4] But we should like to publish it ourselves, in our
own name. Therefore would the persons who made the
offer agree to give us the money for its publication, if only

    

some of it? Please write to tell us whether you are able and
willing to write to them about it.

Yours,
 
Petrov[1]


We propose to publish Hyndman’s article in the near
future with a footnote that “it has been sent to us in the
author’s MS. through the good offices of a member of the
Rabocheye Znamya group in
St. Petersburg”.[5] If you have
anything to say about the underlined words, please inform
us immediately.

All the best,
 Petrov

While in exile in Shushenskoye, Lenin read and translated into
Russian Kautsky’s Bernstein und das sozialdemokratische
Programm. Eine Antikritik (Bernstein and the Social-Democratic
Programme. An Anti-Critique). In 1905, it was published under
the title, K. Kautsky. A Collection of Articles, without any
mention of the translator’s name. The second edition in 1906 said:
“Translated by Lenin.”





[5]
The article, Socialism, Trade-Unionism and Political Action, by
H. M. Hyndman, was ordered by S. V. Andropov for Rabocheye
Znamya No. 3, but was never published. The English original
and Lenin’s translation are now at the Central Party Archives
of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee.

January 24, 1901

Dear Comrade,

I have received your letter about the passports, have
written to my friend here who might be expected to help me
in this respect, and am now awaiting a reply. I think it
will be possible to get a foreign (Bulgarian or German)
passport (for entering Russia), but I’m not hopeful about
a Russian passport, or at least a blank passport, not filled
in. This may, of course, come off, but I should advise you to
take steps right away to secure a foreign passport, at the
risk of being left without any at all. But as regards a Russian
passport, if we succeed in getting one, it will be more likely
in Russia.

If there is to be no mention of Rabocheye Znamya in the
footnote, would you suggest another way of putting it?
For example, from (through) a member of the Rabocheye
Znamya group who worked in St. Petersburg in 1897, or
something like that. I think it would be better to say
somehow through whom the article was received, but if you
think otherwise, naturally we shall publish it without any
indication of how we received it.

I have been told the name of the St. Petersburg man
who made the proposal (in one of the provinces, and a fairly
remote one) about publishing the translation of Kautsky.
I am afraid to entrust the name to the post; however, I
will let you have it in this form. Write down Alexei’s name,
patronymic (in Russian style) and surname, and number
all the 23 letters in their order. Then the surname of this
St. Petersburg man will consist of the following letters:
6, 22, 11, 22 (for this substitute the next letter of the
alphabet), 5, 10 and
13.[2]
 

As to the sale of Revolution and Counter-Revolution,
we shall inquire from those organisations abroad with whom
we have contacts.

Over here everything now depends on transport, which
is eating up a lot of money because this is a new undertaking.
I cannot therefore give you any definite reply as regards
financial aid for fabricating passports, until it has become
clear just how much money is needed for this, and what
the chances are that all the other essentials (money apart)
are available. Alexei paid out money to one influential
organisation as long ago as last spring (sic!) for the purchase of
blank passports (which they had promised), but so far has
had nothing.

Would you agree to take on yourself in the immediate
future a permanent function in transportation—i.e., to
live near the frontier, travel around, communicate with
the contrabandists, etc.? Do you know German, or any
language other than
Russian?[1]


Every good wish,
 Yours,
 Petrov

I enclose the
paper[3]; please show it to no one except
your friend, and let me know your opinion. No. 2 is at the
press.

Write to me at the following address:

Herrn Georg Rittmeyer,
 Kaiserstrasse 53 I.
 München.

(Without any enclosure, if the letter is in Russian.)

February 3, 1901

Dear Comrades,

We are deeply distressed over your letter of refusal to
co-operate. Our letter to Nevzorov (a letter with a special
enclosure for you of the “statement,” the No. 1 of Iskra,
and a proof of Ryazanov’s article) and your refusal letter
must have crossed, having been sent off at the same
time.

This alone will show you how far it was from us to keep
you from taking part in our affairs. We ask you to excuse
the delay—that is indeed our fault, but you must bear in
mind that we suffer as much as you do from the “indefinite
state of relations”. We have strictly abided by our group’s
decision not to circulate the newspaper abroad before it is
circulated in Russia, making an exception only for our
closest associates, including your good selves. Until quite
recently, we had been altogether uncertain as to whether
the paper would circulate in Russia (even today we cannot
vouch for it); we had our hands full in this matter in
connection with some fresh negotiations (with the liberal
democrats—so far a big
secret!),[2] and this delayed
fulfilment of the decision adopted a fortnight or so ago to
send you the issue of Iskra.

Our statement has not yet been circulated in Russia
but has only been shown to several persons.

We repeat that what has happened is the result not of
any lack of concern but of the indefiniteness and bustle
from which we ourselves have not yet emerged. We should

    

be very happy to see the misunderstandings produced by
this cleared up and find you taking your old attitude to our
common cause.

Comradely greetings,
 Petrov
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In starting the newspaper Iskra and the journal Zarya, Lenin
set the task of uniting around the editorial board all Russian
Social-Democrats who could be of use for literary work. That is
why he tried to have the small Borba group work with Iskra,
though it was not important either ideologically and politically
or in respect of ties with the workers’ mass movement.





[2]
A reference to the talks between the Iskra editorial board and
P. Struve, on behalf of the liberals, about the publication of a
general political supplement to Zarya called Sovremennoye
obozreniye (Contemporary Review). The talks lasted through January
1901 (see present edition, Vol. 4, pp. 380–82; Vol. 34, pp. 55–57).
They were subsequently broken off and no supplement appeared.

February 21, 1901

Dear Comrades,

Your insistence on “defining relations” has surprised
us but, to our deep regret, we cannot satisfy you in this
respect. Our business is just being started, the wheels have
only just been set in motion, and whether it will really
get going depends on everyone vigorously co-operating
—when suddenly, instead of doing the urgent work, we are
asked to set about “defining relations” with some kind
of particular exactness! We think that close and constant
collaboration (which has already been expressed by your
sending us two articles, and on which we were relying for
the future) is a sufficiently definite relation, and that from
it there clearly follows also the right of contributors to
speak on behalf of the publication, enlist supporters,
establish contacts, collect funds, order articles, etc. That this
enlistment will naturally lead also to more intimate
contacts between those enlisted and the editorial board, and
that the establishment of final agreements (about any
undertaking, or about the management of this or that
section, or this or that function) will require direct contacts
between the editorial board and those who have been
enlisted, all this likewise follows, as a matter of course, from
the very nature of relations between close contributors
and the editorial board.

We hope that our relations could in the course of time
develop from the form of simple collaboration to the kind
of co-operation under which some departments would be
allocated, and general editorial conferences would be held
from time to time.
 

Furthermore, we do not deny of course that the business
of organising things abroad will require (in 3 or 6 months’
time) the creation of new forms, organs and functions, and
were relying on you in this respect, but we are unable-to
set about all this immediately, when Zarya and Iskra have
still to be consolidated.

We hope that you, too, will realise our position and
will agree that any further “definition of relations” at the
present time is impossible.

All the best.

February 27, 1901

Dear P. B.,

I have received both your letters, and have passed on
the letter from Italy to V. I. I don’t yet know the contents
of that letter, because I transmitted it through
Blumenfeld. He and I are setting out tomorrow: he is going on
through Vienna, I am going via Vienna to Prague on my
own
business.[2] Please excuse me for writing briefly, because
of appointments and packing.

A letter has come from Dietz to the effect that he is not
printing the statement (about an alliance with the
liberals), that this is dangerous (“amalgamation”, groups, etc.)
and that, altogether, would it not be better for us to have
a secret printing press?! We are very much astounded by this
piece of news from the erratic idiot Dietz. We have decided
(
provisorisch[1]

)

for the time being to leave Zarya here (for
the time being!) and print the rest in Geneva.

I think that diplomatic relations with the Parisians have
been resumed.

Molotov has already written his article on finance (for
No. 3 of
Iskra).[3] He has promised a review of foreign affairs.

There is still not quite enough material for No. 3 of
Iskra.

Judas (the calf) has not yet left. He is clearing out at
last in a few days, I think—thank God. “All is well” with
him.

From home there is letter after letter about the student
disorders. My brother writes that he will soon be coming.
 

No. 2[4] has not yet reached Russia.

All the best. I will make certain to write a more sensible
letter when I return (I shall be away for 4 or 7 days) and
take up my usual routine.

Yours,
 Petrov

March 22, 1901

Many thanks for your letter of March 2 addressed to
Rittmeyer. We are very glad that we have at last
established correspondence with you (of which I wrote you as far
back as July15!). Please observe the rules so that we
should always know in any important affair that the letter
will reach us. The address you used last time is one of
the best: make use of it.

Collect cash. We have now been reduced almost to beggary,
and it is a question of life or death for us to obtain a large
sum. We shall send you Zarya in a few days. So do
everything you can about
finance.[1]


How do matters stand with the doctor’s
group?[2] Last
summer, their representative behaved in a way that was
equivalent to a rupture (he made some idiotic demands on
us)—but later a member of his group renewed contact with
our representative in
Berlin.[3] Get some sense out of them:
are they willing to help us or not?

Send us an address for delivering a
suitcase,[4] and a
more reliable one for letters and books.

Yours,
 Starik

What about the Finnish
routes[5]? We know nothing,
and have not had a single letter from you about this. Please,
repeat.
 

If the bearers of a suitcase have no letter from the
organisation, then you should not talk freely with them about
anything at all.
 

Notes
 

[1]
The money can be sent through a bank by cheque, in a registered
letter addressed to Carl Lehmann (the third letter is a German h),
M.D., Gabelsbergerstrasse 20a. Keep this address in mind: it is good
for cash, and for letters and books.—Lenin
 



[2]
The identity of the “doctor’s group” is unknown.





[3]
Iskra’s representative in Berlin was M. G. Vecheslov.





[4]
Illegal Iskra and Zarya literature was transported to Russia in
double-bottomed suitcases.





[5]

St. Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the
Working Class was transporting its illegal literature through
Finland and Stockholm as early as the end of the 1890s.
Transportation was organised by K. H. Branting, a Swedish
Social-Democrat, Carder, a Norwegian Social-Democrat, and A. Weidel,
a Swedish worker who settled in Finland for that purpose. But
Garder’s arrest in 1900 disrupted the arrangement and the route
via Finland. A route running from Stockholm to Abo and across
the Russian frontier was restarted in 1901.

In the letter Lenin asks about the results of efforts to resume
transportation across Finland.

Alexei and I have just received your letter about Zarya.
Many thanks for your detailed and frank opinion; we find
such comments all the more valuable because they are so
rare. What you say about the inadequacy of the political
reviews and articles in Zarya is perfectly justified. We fully
realise this inadequacy, and will do everything to put it
right.

With best wishes,

April 19, 1901

Dear Comrade,

Our comrade in Berlin has already written you on our
behalf that we should like to establish closer contacts with
the Swedish and Finnish comrades.

Allow me, at this time, to make the following request
on behalf of the editorial board of the Russian
Social-Democratic journal Zarya (J.H.W. Dietz Verlag.
Stuttgart).

We attach very great importance to informing the
Russians in general, and the Russian workers in particular,
of the political situation in Finland and the oppression
of Finland, and also of the stubborn struggle waged by the
Finns against despotism. We should therefore be most
grateful to you if you transmitted to all the Finnish
comrades you know our urgent request to support us in this
undertaking.

It would of course be particularly helpful for us if we
could find a permanent Finnish contributor who would
send us, firstly, monthly notes (4,000-8,000 letters), and,
secondly, longer articles and reviews from time to time.
We need the latter for Zarya and the former for the illegal
Russian paper Iskra, whose editorial board has made this
request of us.

If you think it useful, I will send you Zarya and two
issues of Iskra.

The articles may be written also in Swedish or in
Finnish; we shall find a translator ourselves.
 

I beg you to inform me whether you can comply with
our request.

With Social-Democratic greetings,
 I. Petrov

P.S. Please excuse my extremely bad German.

My address is as follows:
   Herrn J. H. W. Dietz Verlag.
   Furthbachstr. 12.
   Stuttgart.

On the inner envelope:
   An die Redaktion der Morgenröte—für Herrn Petroff.

The letter was an exhibit at the Royal Library exposition in

April 21, 1901

Dear G. V.,

We are very glad that your adventure ended
satisfactorily.[1] We are expecting you: we need to have a talk about
a great deal, both on literary and on organisational subjects,
and about Iskra (the third issue should be ready by May 1.
Then we want straightaway to print No. 4), and about 
Zarya. You have the address for calling—Velika Dmitrievna’s.
Here is another (Alexei’s) just in case: Occamstr. (in
Schwabing) 1a, III, rechts bei Frau Kraft, and ask for Herrn Vernet;
only it would be better, when using this address, to write
beforehand about your call, as otherwise you may easily
not find anyone at home.

I send you Promyshlenny Mir Nos. 1–11. We have Frank—
I will send it to you, if you need it before you
come.[2]


We have only one copy of Na Slavnom
Postu[3]: we shall
order another, because there is a big demand for it.

We are in complete agreement with you about the
priority of organisation over agitation at the present time. Listok
“Iskry” is fairly cautious about any direct appeal—or do
you consider even this
dangerous[4]?

Hoping to see you soon.

Yours,
 Petrov

Please bring or send Narodnoye
Khozyaistvo.[5]

A reference to the following incident. On April 5, 1901, Russian
students in Geneva staged a demonstration in front of the
Russian Consulate in protest against the harassment of political
émigrés. The Russian Government took the occasion to exercise
pressure on the Swiss authorities to secure the deportation of
prominent political expatriates, chiefly Plekhanov, from
Switzerland. However, Plekhanov was able to prove that he had
nothing to do with the demonstration. Members of Iskra’s Editorial
Board had feared an unfavourable outcome.

Essay, St. Petersburg, 1900. Plekhanov’s review of the book
was published in Zarya’s double issue No. 2–3 in
December 1901.

Na Slavnom Postu (At a Glorious Post)—a literary collection
published by the Narodniks to mark the 40th anniversary (1860–
1900) of the literary and social activity of N. K. Mikhailovsky,
one of their ideologists. It contained articles by N. Annensky,

   

N. Karyshev, P. Milyukov, N. Mikhailovsky, P. Mokievsky,
V. Myakotin, A. Peshekhonov, M. Rafailov, N. Rubakin, V. 
Semevsky, V. Chernov, A. Chuprov, S. Yuzhakov and others.
Neither Iskra nor Zarya published any review of the book.





[4]
Lenin is replying to Plekhanov on the question of Iskra’s
tactics and slogans for marking May 1, 1901 in Russia as set forth
in May Day Listok “Iskry”. In a letter to the Munich section of
Iskra’s Editorial Board on April 19, Plekhanov wrote that the
workers in Russia should not be urged to demonstrate during
the May Day celebrations, because the government would jump
at the occasion to shed blood and the workers would be defeated.
Plekhanov believed that the main task at the time was to build
up local Social-Democratic organisations. The letter shows that
in the concrete historical situation Lenin was in agreement with
Plekhanov.

For Yuriev

April 25

I have received your letter.

Please send us as soon as you can an exact account of
how many suitcases you have received and of what kind,
how many have gone and how many remain. We need this
to draw up our report and financial accounts. As regards
the literature, I have also long been asking you to write
how much you received, and what in particular, where you
sent it and how it was used.

We have not got the May Day leaflet (N.B.).

The money (100 marks) has already been sent; I repeat
my request that you make an extra effort to obtain money
in Berlin and elsewhere for the suitcases; you will thereby
be giving us the most serious and essential help. How much
money of your own have you in hand? What is the average
(and actual) monthly turnover?

It would be very important to send Kharkov Days
as soon as possible to the South, where they are pressing
for it.

I have not quite understood you about the bulletin.
(1) Is it the Iskra Promotion Group or the Neutral Group
that wants to publish
it?[1] (2) Are the bulletins to be the
same as before or different? We think that it would be
extremely unwise to spend money on bulletins of the old
type and, for our part, find it difficult to promise raw
material, for the reason that we are working intensively at
present on turning Iskra into a monthly
paper,[2] and we
have neither the time nor the money for copying and sending

    

out material. What we have to think of is not dividing up
the available material into bulletins, and weakening both
its importance and impression by circulating it in a raw
state abroad, but, on the contrary, concentrating all the
material in Iskra and accelerating its publication with
well-edited and illuminated material. Any other tactics would
mean not a struggle against, but a promotion of, the present
ideological vacillation and confusion.

It is not surprising that such bulletins were published
by the Neutral Group, with its absurd composition and
programme, but we should expect more co-operation and
rational work from the Iskra Promotion Group. Try and
pass on these views to your group (but do not read my letter
in full, because I am writing to you personally) and
persuade it. Let us know its decision.

Bulletins reviewing the foreign press on Russia are a
different matter. They are of course useful. Send us cuttings
from the Russian papers. Would it also be possible to
supply the Iskra editorial board with Russian journals, after
they have been read in Berlin? If it would, let us know what
journals we could count on (we have some, but not enough).
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The bulletins were to be published by the Iskra promotion group
in Berlin, but were not because of a shortage of money and
material.

The Neutral Group of Social-Democrats in Berlin was formed
round V. A. Bazarov in the autumn of 1900 and set itself the task
of healing the split between the supporters of Rabocheye Dyelo
and the Emancipation of Labour group after the Second Congress
of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad. Among its
members were also M. G. Vecheslov and I. B. Basovsky.
According to Bazarov, the group sent its representatives to Geneva in
early 1900 to persuade the Iskra and the Sotsial-Demokrat
organisations to be reconciled with the Union. The group issued three
or four political proclamations and was disbanded in the summer
of 1901.





[2]
Beginning with issue No. 4 in May 1901, Iskra appeared
periodically, once or twice a month.

We have received your letter. We fully approve of your
method of distributing the literature, and advise you to
keep strictly to it, without listening to anyone’s advice
or calumny.

One thing that is desirable is that you should show some
consideration for the Sotsialist
group,[2] and, in case of need,
give them some privileges (for example, credit), because
they are seeking to come closer to us, and promise to agitate
for us. They have offered us a share of their income instead
of payment for literature; we authorise you to accept this,
at your discretion,
if you find it not unprofitable financially.
(Why do the Sotsialist group complain that you don’t give
them any literature?)

In general, don’t give away anything free, but distribute
everything as quickly as possible for cash.

Don’t give any money to Grigoryev, send it all to us.
Grigoryev should make money on his own literature, of
which he has a lot.

Number 3 is being printed, and the fourth is to follow
immediately. A May Day leaflet and a special Iskra leaflet
have
appeared.[3]

Do everything you can to have people sent to Berlin to
collect the suitcases (the address
is).[1]

The password is:
from Petrov.

If you still have some 100–200 of Kharkov Days, send
them immediately by hand to....

Contact Pskov. We shall be sending the suitcases to
Lepeshinsky, and you can collect them from him.
 

Notes

A blank space in the manuscript.—Ed.
 



[2]
The Sotsialist group was organised in St. Petersburg in the
summer of 1900; its members were dissatisfied with the Economist
trend of the St. Petersburg League of Struggle. The group laid
emphasis on political, struggle. In January 1901, it merged with
the Rabocheye Znamya (Workers’ Banner) group, but after the
arrests in the spring of 1901 the group broke up.





[3]
Two May Day leaflets were issued in 1901: in April, Listok “Iskry”
(Iskra’s leaflet) signed by the Iskra organisation, and the
all-Party leaflet, Pervoye Maya (The First of May), adopted at a
conference of several Southern committees at the beginning of
February. A comparison of the two shows that the latter pursued

   

the general aims of spreading socialist ideas among the masses,
whereas the former put forward slogans of political struggle
against the autocracy, in response to the broad student movement
which had been revolutionised by workers’ participation.

2a 3b-r—–[1]

June 1, 1901

We should be very glad to work together with —r——.
He would be particularly useful at this time of wobbling
among the public in general, and of all kinds of intrigues
abroad in particular. Unfortunately, our financial
position is very bad, and we are absolutely unable to allocate
any money for his journey and his living expenses. It is
also extremely difficult to find paid employment here (we
say nothing of France and French Switzerland, because
we don’t know them. —r–—himself is better informed
about this than we are). Only in one case could we give some
financial support: if —r–—were to undertake to go abroad,
get a French passport here and use it to cross the frontier
two or three times in various places, taking across a couple
of suitcases each time. We have to pay for such transport
anyway, and should of course pay him more willingly than
some outsider. With his knowledge of the language and
his resourcefulness, he would certainly be able to do it, and
might find someone else on the way for the same purpose.
If he is agreeable, let him write at once—you will read
him the whole of this letter—and tell us his distinguishing
features in as great detail as possible. On the strength
of these features we shall then immediately apply for a
French passport, and on receipt of it will let him know, so
that he can start out. In general, our cause now hinges on
transport, transport and transport. Whoever wants to help
us should entirely concentrate on this.
 

Now about the 125 rubles. We have been repeatedly
caught out over advances to other organisations: we have
given away a pile of money, and the result has been
insignificant, almost nil. Therefore we are very much afraid of
paying in advance. Furthermore, it is more important
for us to have swift delivery of a small quantity (if only
half a pood a month) than of 10–20 poods over 3-4 months,
because our first priority is Iskra’s monthly publication
and delivery. Up to now suitcases virtually alone have kept
us going. So have as detailed a discussion as possible to find
out whether the offer is reliable, which organisation is
making it, the type of transport, and whether we could have our
own man in there for supervision and participation, and then
let us know. If they agree to have a trial run without payment
in advance, take the decision yourselves. But if we are to
hand over a sizable sum immediately, we shall have to
consider and discuss all the particulars very thoroughly.

June 1, 1901

Dear P. B.,

We have just received your letter with the materials
and letters of
Deb.[1]
[3]

enclosed. Many thanks; we shall
have to sort out the material.

As regards Deb.’s proposal, we agree of course to let
him have 300 offprints, and we hope that his reservations
will not present the slightest obstacle to our printing his
reminiscences. The deadline for No. 2 of Zarya is one month,
i.e., July 1. The maximum length is 2 sheets, or 2 1/2 at the
outside. We hope that he will divide up his 4–5 sheets into
chapters, so that they will fit into No. 2 and No. 3 of Zarya.

We know nothing as yet about the
conference.[4] Please
persuade Koltsov and someone else from Sotsial-Demokrat
to agree. After all, this does not commit anyone to anything,
but it removes from us the odium of being unwilling to stop
the dissension. We really are not inclined to make any
substantial concessions either to Borba or to Rabocheye
Dyelo (how feeble No. 7 of its Listok
is[5]! We have already
left it behind even technically, in speed of coverage).

No. 5 of Iskra is at the press. The leading article is “About
Vacuous Dreams” (by Starover). A feature article by G. V.,
“New Wine in Old Bottles”, is about the manifesto of
the Socialist-Revolutionaries and their turn towards the
Social-Democrats. Then one (or even two) short articles on
the massacre of May 4–7 in St. Petersburg (in Vyborgskaya
Storona and at the Obukhov Works). There is also some
pretty good material for the social chronicle and the labour

    

movement section, and also for the “May Day in Russia”
section—for instance, a vivid letter from a St. Petersburg
working woman about the killing on May 4 of a workman
(her relative) in the crowd marching to Nevsky
Prospekt.[6]
There is a letter from our close friend, a worker at

Ivanovo-Voznesensk,[7] about the feeling there, the attempts to
celebrate May Day and the success of Iskra.

Only the financial side is in a bad way; all the rest is
going well, with promise for the future.

How is your health? Is it easier for you now in your

Erwerbsarbeit[2]

?

Do you get enough rest? How do you intend
to spend the summer?

Very best wishes to you and all your family.

Yours,
 Petrov

Deb.—V. K. Debogory-Mokrievich, a revolutionary Narodnik
of the 1870s, who lived in Bulgaria from 1894 and died there.
In 1901, the Zarya Editorial Board asked him for some extract
from his memoirs. Although he agreed, and the members of the
editorial board corresponded on the subject, his memoirs were
not published in Zarya.





[4]
The conference mentioned hero was held in Geneva in June 1901.
It was attended by the representatives of =

Iskra, Zarya, the Borba
and the Rabocheye Dyelo groups, the Union of Russian
Social-Democrats Abroad, the Bund and the revolutionary 
Sotsial-Demokrat organisation. It was preliminary, and the final decisions
were put off until the “Unity” Conference in October 1901,
at which the =

Rabocheye Dyelo and the Iskra groups finally split
up.





[5]
Listok Rabochego Dyela (Rabocheye Dyelo Supplement) was
published by the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad in
Geneva, at irregular intervals, in 1900 and 1901.

Its No. 7 appeared in April 1901 and dealt with the student
movement.

A reference to the events of May 4 and 7, 1901, in St. Petersburg,
in Vyborgskaya Storona and at the Obukhov Steel Works (known
as “Obukhov defence”). Iskra No. 5 (June 1901) carried a letter,
“May Day in Russia”, and Lenin’s article, “Another Massacre”
(see present edition, Vol. 5 pp. 25–30).





[7]
The author was I. V. Babushkin. His report, “Ivanovo–
Voznesensk”, appeared in Iskra No. 5, June 1901, in its section “May
Day in Russia ”. Babushkin’s role in the Russian Social–
Democratic movement (until his execution in Siberia by a tsarist punitive
expedition in 1905), in establishing Iskra and in supplying it
with workers’ reports, is described in detail in Lenin’s obituary in
Rabochaya Gazeta No. 2, December 18 (31), 1910 (see present
edition, Vol. 16, pp. 361–64).

June 17, 1901

We have received your letter asking us to send you 100
marks. Unfortunately, I cannot fulfil this request until
I have received from you the “latest information” which
you promised. I simply cannot take it on myself to decide
to pay out this sum (both for formal reasons, because it
depends on the board, and for the reasons I explained to
you when we met), and I cannot get the hoard together at
present because some people arc absent. I ask you once
again not to be sparing of reports to us of the latest and most
detailed facts, otherwise our relations will never settle
down to normal. Information of the kind that “so far
everything is satisfactory” may produce, if anything, a negative
impression on our board, which decides such matters. I
understand very well that the most energetic efforts often
prove fruitless for reasons beyond our control, and that it
would be stupid to blame you for any failures. But you,
too, must understand that unless we have the most
circumstantial and exact information of what those efforts were,
what exactly was successful (
respective[1]

unsuccessful), why
precisely and what the state of affairs and the plans at the
present moment are, we cannot take any further steps and
impose on our principals further sacrifices, for which we
bear the responsibility.

July 9, 1901

Dear P. B.,

I enclose Nevzorov’s article, which we have
rejected.[1]
Just have a look at this thing (I heard you were interested
in it), and when you have read it, please send it on at once
to G. V., who is also interested in the Parisians. We think
it is essential to keep a copy, as a document.

We are having No. 6 of Iskra set up—it will probably
be 6 pages, because there is a good deal of material in the
social chronicle and on the labour movement. For the second
number of Zarya we have sent
(1) G. V.’s leading article,
“What Next?”, and
(2) L. I.’s article, “Why We Don’t
Want to Go Backwards”, signed Orthodox. Then Arsenyev
and Velika Dmitrievna are writing articles, and there’s
a paper by Alexei (what did you think of it? Velika D.
was dissatisfied). I have written a little article on Witte’s
minute and the preface to it, and have of course damned
Mr. R.N.S.[2]—Velika Dmitrievna is very much displeased,
and I shall have to send the article to G. V., etc.: this Mr. 
R. N. S. is a sore point!

How is your work going, and how is your health? Will
you have a long holiday this year, and where do you intend
to spend it? I should very, very much like you to look in
here and have a talk about various things—but I am afraid
of inviting you lest, instead of relaxing, you put more strain
on your nerves. If this does not frighten you, do come.

They have written to us from Russia that there is
increasing talk of a congress. This once again impels us to think
of a programme. The publication of a draft programme is
extremely necessary, and would be of tremendous

    

importance.[3] But apart from you and G. V. there is no one to
take it on: it’s a job that requires calm concentration and
careful consideration. Please come to our help, provided your
affairs and your health permit. Or perhaps you will see
G. V. and spend some time with him—you could then take
advantage of such a stay?

Kautsky passed through here (on his way for a holiday
in Tyrol), but we forgot to talk with him about the Erfurter
Programm (which Alexei is now looking through). Has
he promised a special introduction?

What were the books about which you told Alexei’s
sister that they had been sent?

We can’t be too sure about the foreign affairs review
for Zarya: Parvus wants to write only about organisation,
Luxemburg and Danevich will (perhaps) give us something
on France, and nothing else, neither on Germany nor
Austria. That’s bad!

Well, until later. Forgive me for writing so rarely; I
have very little time left in the local hurly-burly.
The
Londoners[4] are here at the moment; I like them. What
do you think of them?




Very best wishes to you and all your family. Yours....




Leiteisen’s address is: 52, Faubourg du Temple. Mr. 
Gouman. Paris; on the inner envelope: pour Mr. Basile.

[We shall have to wait a little with reprinting the first
issue of Iskra: the matter of the one thousand copies that
have been preserved, as it turns out, and of the attempt
now being made to transport them will soon be cleared up.]

The note on Adler will still be in time for Iskra
No. 6,[5]
if it arrives not later than in a week.

I write nothing about the draft agreement with the Union:
there is nothing new, and you must know the old situation
from Alexei’s sister.

A reference to Nevzorov’s (Y. Steklov) article, “Well, Where
Do We Begin?”, directed against Lenin’s “Where To Begin?”
(see present edition, Vol. 5, pp. 13–24) published in Iskra No. 4,
May 1901, as a leading article. For Lenin’s assessment of
Nevzorov’s article see present edition, Vol. 34, p. 75.





[2]
Lenin’s article written in June 1901, entitled “The Persecutors
of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism”. It criticises

__PRINTERS_P_625_COMMENT__
40—39

   

the secret minute of the tsarist Minister Witte, “The Autocracy
and the Zemstvo”, and the preface written by the Liberal, P. B.
Struve (R. N. S.), published abroad illegally. The article was
published in the Zarya’s double issue No. 2–3, December 1901 (see
present edition, Vol. 5, pp. 31–80).

For over a month, members of Iskra’s Editorial Board polemised
over the article in their letters. Lenin accepted some of the
proposals to reword some of his formulations but flatly refused
to modify the sharply accusatory tone and tenor of the article
(see present edition, Vol. 34, pp. 83–84, and p. 91 of this volume).





[3]
On Lenin’s initiative, Iskra’s editorial board started to draft
the R.S.D.L.P. Programme in the summer of 1901. The draft
was published in Iskra No. 21, June 1, 1902.

July 13, 1904

I have received your letter of the 11th. As regards
Orthodox’s
P. Scriptum,[4] the majority opinion is being set forth
to you today by Alexei. I disagree with this opinion,
and I (personally) would like to know your view, both of
this P.S. in particular, and of the opinion likewise that it
could supposedly be rejected after the adoption of the whole
article, owing to the “literary defects” in the P. Scriptum.
The “rescue” of the P.S., about which you write, may be
possible if there is a resolute vote by Pavel Borisovich for,
and even then not for certain: the votes will be equally
divided, for Alexei is now almost entirely against.

Generally speaking, I think that on any matter in any
way relating to “controversial” points, you ought to make
a direct inquiry about the reasons for the opinions
expressed by our Struvefreundliche[5]: this could be done by
letters addressed to Lehmann as before (altogether, letters
should now be addressed through to Lehmann) with an
addition “für Meyer” and “for Puttman” I’m afraid I simply
cannot undertake to give an account of their views. This
applies also, for instance, to my article against
R. N. S.[6]

Many thanks for the offer to send material against
Chernov. I have just got on to him, and could probably find
use for what bears on France and Belgium (Vandervelde et
Destrée, Le socialisme en
Belgique,[1]

quoted by Chernov,
and also Vandervelde’s latest
work[7]). But send it only
if you don’t need it, and if you can do without it for a few
weeks. I very much need to have Liebknecht’s Zur

    

Grundund
Bodenfrage,[2]

which I have failed to find here, either
among Parvus’s books or at the library. If you do have it,
please send it along for a short time.

Chernov quotes someone called Gerolamo Gatti, who is
a downright opponent of the Marxists: Le nuove correnti
dell’economia agricola (Milano-Palermo,
1900).[3]

Do you
know what sort of bird this is? Is he worth reading? Is there
a French translation? (I don’t know Italian, though perhaps
my sister could help.)

Very best wishes. Write about my article.

Yours,
 Petrov

P. Scriptum to Orthodox’s article was written by the author,

on N. A. Berdayev’s article “Struggle for Idealism”, which
appeared in the magazine Mir Bozhy (God’s World) No. 6, June
1901. The latter, a liberal, later became a reactionary.

Lenin and G. V. Plekhanov insisted on the publication of
P. Scriptum, but on a majority decision of the Board (Y. O. Martov,
V. I. Zasulich and A. N. Potresov) the article was published
without P. Scriptum in Zarya No. 2–3, December 1901.

July 21, 1901

Dear P. B.,

I was intending to reply to your letter, but kept putting
it off until I received the article. Don’t be in any particular
hurry with it, if it is hard work, or even give up reading
it altogether, to give yourself a rest and have some proper
treatment. G. V. has already written to me in considerable
detail where he sees changes desirable, and I shall of course
try to make all these
changes[3] (but as to changing the
tone... I really don’t know whether I can do that. It is
hardly likely that I can write in diplomatic tones about a
gentleman who arouses such violent feelings in me. And I don’t
think G. V. is quite right when he says that my “hatred”
will be incomprehensible for the reader: I will quote the
example of Parvus, who, without any knowledge of the
author, after reading the introduction felt the same
hostility to this “dolt”, as he called him—but that is in
parenthesis). I very much disapproved of our having
imposed two jobs on you (reading my article and Orthodox’s)
just when you had gone away for treatment and a rest. Try
rather to make really good use of the period of your
treatment, and do not by any means burden yourself with a
close reading of the manuscripts.

Please, write (and send manuscripts and everything else)
only to the following address:
   Herrn Dr. Med. Carl Lehmann.
   Gabelsbergerstrasse 20 a/II.
   München (inside: fur Meyer).

The Rittmeyer address is no longer good (but if you have

    

sent something to Rittmeyer before receiving this letter,
we shall still get it).

Do you happen to have Liebknecht’s book Zur
Grundund Bodenfrage (Leipzig 1876)? Or perhaps one of the
Zurich comrades has it? I need it very much for an article
against Chernov, and it is not available at the library
here, nor has Parvus or Lehmann got it.

Well, so long. I wish you the very best, and hope you
have a good rest and are thoroughly fit again.

Yours,
 Petrov

P.S. Here’s another request: do you (or Greulich)
happen to have the minutes of the congresses of the International
—or
Vorbote[4] (which, I believe, carried the full reports)?
This Chernov fellow keeps worrying me: I do believe the
scoundrel has distorted things in referring to the minutes
of the congresses of the International, and putting down
as “dogmatic Marxism” even the “solidarised
communities” (of
Rittinghausen).[5] If you could help me with this
material, I should be very grateful.

[But if you have to go to a lot of trouble to find these
references, don’t do it, please: I shall manage somehow.]

Here’s yet another request (I feel that I’m making a
hog of myself—piling up request upon request—but it’s
hard to stop once you’ve started. But really, if you have to
go to a lot of trouble, like travelling about in search of
the books, etc., let it go, and “shelve” my applications.
I’ll manage somehow. I shall make mincemeat of Chernov
in any case). The fact is that the swine Chernov quotes
Engels’s article, “The German Peasant” (in Russkoye
Bogatstvo, 1900, No. 1). When I found the article I discovered
that it was a translation of Engels’s article “Die Mark”
(
Anhang[1]

to the pamphlet, Die Entwicklung des
Sozialismus von der Utopie zur
Wissenschaft)[6] (I’ve only got the
4th edition of the pamphlet, 1891), but at the end of the
translated text there is an addition of two tirades in Russian
which the original does not have and which contain highly
dubious statements: “restore (sic!) the mark”, etc.
 

I wonder what that is: a distortion by Russkoye
Bogatstvo? In which case they ought to be pilloried good and
proper. But first we must look at this from every side:
a footnote to the Russian article says that Engels’s article
“appeared in one of the German magazines in the 1880s,
without his signature. But the offprint which Engels sent
to one of his friends was signed with his initials”.
(1) Have
you any idea which “German magazine” it is? Could it be
Neue Zeit?
(2) Do you happen to have an early edition
of the pamphlet Die Entwicklung des Sozialismus von der
Utopie, etc., with the “Die Mark” Anhang? It is necessary
to make a collation to find out whether the early editions
contained the tirades the 4th edition does not have (
although this is very unlikely).

Then I need for the purposes of comparison the
pamphlet: W. Wolff, Die schlesische
Milliarde,[7] which I was
unable to find at the local library and which is not
available at the Vorwärts
Buchhandlung[2]

either—it’s been sold
out.

August 24, 1901

Dear P. B.,

I enclose Nevzorov’s article which he has rewritten. It
has confronted us with this dilemma: either to publish
it in Zarya, or to reject it altogether. The votes are divided
equally (Alexei and Arsenyev, for; Velika Dmitrievna and I,
against). Please cast your vote. I must say that I am
particularly exasperated by the fact that everyone (even
Arsenyev!) says the article is “vile”, “treacherous” (as G. V.
has also called it), but they keep talking of printing it!
To my mind, this is the worst tactics of indulgence and
connivance. They say in defence of the article: “It’s a
contributor’s letter to the editorial board. It’s awkward
to reject it.”
In my opinion, once a contributor adopts that
kind of attitude, we are in duty bound to put an end to it.
Let him go to Rabocheye Dyelo and Godspeed (Nevzorov
even wrote to ask us if we had any objections to it!? Sic!)—
that will help us to “document” his figure much better,
and take him to pieces much more freely than in our Zarya.
(One of the arguments for was that it should be printed
to provide the occasion for replying to the widespread
arguments.)

And so, it’s up to you to decide the issue!

And how about Finn’s article? If it’s a good one (as
you wrote), shouldn’t we publish it in Zarya? Will you
send it to us?

How is your health? I heard that you were not far from
Thun, but I hope the letter will be readdressed.
 

When do you expect to visit G. V.? We rely on you very
much as regards the programme.

Well, so long. Hope you will be fit soon, and all the best.

Yours,
 Petrov

Number seven of Iskra will appear in a day or two. G. V.’s
article (the second against Struve) has been sent to Zarya.
Then there will be articles by Nevzorov, Alexei, Velika
Dmitrievna and Arsenyev; one on the agrarian question
(which I am
writing)[1] and one by G. V. against Bernstein
(a review of the Russian translation of his book). There
is no review of foreign affairs. Perhaps Danevich will write
one? He has already sent in a second letter for Iskra (it
will go into No. 8).

August 30, 1901

Dear P. B.,

I received your letter today, and today also sent off the
proofs of my
article[1] to Dietz. I have made the change
you suggested—at the end, separating the liberals from the
revolutionaries who had been designated together as “we”.
But as regards the “providential slip”, I could do nothing
about it: alteration of this passage would have required
much too extensive changes; besides, the spirit of the whole
article makes it impossible to alter it in the sense of
eliminating the “one-sidedness” (you are right, of course,
that the presentation is “one-sided”: how could one observe
a judicious balance in a polemical article devoted to an
attack on one of the flanks of our opponents! What I mean
is that it’s not that I don’t see the defect here but that it
lies too deep to be eliminated by one particular alteration).

We have been receiving all your letters. As regards my
sister, I don’t know how matters stand, because I haven’t
heard from her for quite a long time.

You have, of course, received Alexei’s letter describing
the obstacle to the
congress[2]? We shall wait and see how
you and Danevich decide this matter.

The seventh
issue[3] has appeared, and has of course
been sent to you. In the eighth, there will be Ryazanov’s
article, “The Imperial Drink Shop” (on the vodka
monopoly); then we anticipate an article on the new law (of June
8) on land grants to nobles in
Siberia.[4] In the social
chronicle, there are reports on the liberals’ congress, the
disgraceful treatment of exiles in Siberia, the deep unrest in

    

out-of-the-way places like Kursk, and about the revolt
of seminary and gymnasium students. We also have a very
interesting article by a worker—a reply to Dadonov, who
abused the Ivanovo-Voznesensk workers in Russkoye
Bogatstvo.[5] It’s a very good article, they say (I haven’t
read it yet), so that we don’t know where it should be best
printed, in Iskra or in Zarya.
In No. 8 of Iskra, there is
a letter by Danevich from France.

We still have no foreign review for Zarya! Nor are we
likely to have one on home affairs
either.[6] It’s a
misfortune! Meanwhile, Zarya is getting fatter and fatter. We
already have 6 sheets+4 (Plekhanov’s “Critique”)+2
(him again, against Bernstein)+2 (Nevzorov+Alexei)+2
or 3 (Velika Dmitrievna and Starover).... As for me, I’m
bogged down in the agrarian question.

Well, I hope we shall soon meet.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Petrov

Martov), eight members of the Sotsial-Demokrat organisation (
including three members of the Emancipation of Labour group:
G. V. Plekhanov, P. B. Axelrod and V. I. Zasulich), 16 members
of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats (including five members
of the Bund’s Committee Abroad), and three members of the
Borba group. On the first item of the agenda, “Agreement in
Principle and Instructions to Editorial Boards”, Lenin, who
attended the Congress under the name of Frey, delivered an
eloquent speech, exposing the Union’s opportunist activity. This
was Lenin s first public speech before Russian Social-Democrats
abroad. When the opportunist amendments and addenda to the
June resolution, adopted by the Third Congress of the Union
of Russian Social-Democrats, were announced at the Congress,
the revolutionary section of the Congress (members of the Iskra
and Zarya and the Sotsial-Demokrat organisations) read out a
statement saying that unity was impossible and left the Congress.
On Lenin’s initiative, these organisations in October 1901 united
into the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy
Abroad.

written by Y. O. Martov and signed “Ignotus”. It dealt with the
Lübeck Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party.

November 3, 1901

Dear Comrade,

You told us, in our talk here before the departure,
that however our relations developed—and even if we went
our several ways—you would in any case remain a
contributor to our publications. After that we repeated to each
other, even after the sad outcome of our negotiations
on
organisation,[1] that we did not in any way “declare
war on each other”, and remained political allies albeit
temporarily treading our different ways.

We hope, therefore, that you will continue to send your
letters from France to Iskra. To our regret, we have not
been able to get a definite reply to this question from
the member of your group here. Please, let us know
whether or not you intend to co-operate with us in the
future.

You know, of course, how much we value your literary
co-operation, and if today, after the formation of the
League, the organisational relations between ourselves and
your group have become more complicated, there are no
obstacles to closer literary collaboration on our part, in
any case. We should welcome it.

With comradely greetings....

P.S. From what Ryazanov said I have drawn the
conclusion that my words about the possible effect of our
differences on the literary agreement were misunderstood.
All I had in mind was the pamphlets agreement (the League
has set up a special board of pamphlet editors); but the

    

foundation of the League has not affected the purely literary
relations between the editorial board of Zarya and Iskra
and their contributors.

November 27, 1901

Dear L. I.,

Thank you for your book which V. Iv. has shown me.
I very much regret that I have not yet been able to start
reading it: first, I have lately been very busy with a
pamphlet (against Rabocheye
Dyelo),[1] and, secondly, I am once
again going down with some “undetermined” illness. The
work is at a standstill, and I don’t know how soon I shall
be able to get down to it again! And it’s urgent work.

As regards a recommendation to Popova, to my deep
regret I am quite unsuitable for this. I don’t know and never
have known Popova personally. I dealt with her only
through Struve (and, you will understand, it’s quite out of
the question to ask him to recommend your book. Yet he is
editorial manager of Popova’s publications!). If I were to
apply to Popova, therefore, the result would be sooner
negative than otherwise.

But even that is not all. I recently wrote (a month or
six weeks ago) to Popova for the first time, asking her to
send me a copy of the second volume of the Webbs, the
translation of which I edited and which has only just been
published.[2] Up to this day I have neither reply nor book!

I once had what you might call a “friendly”
correspondence with Vodovozova. But she has not replied at all to my
last letter to her (a business one, written last spring!). As
you see, there again I am no use at all.

You will have either to look for someone with better
connections in literary and publishing circles, or to apply
directly to several publishers enclosing your book. [

    

Perhaps Filippov could help you? After all, he has printed
something of yours! My relations with him have been broken
off.]

Berg will write to you or have a personal talk with you:
he wants to go soon.

Best wishes,
 Yours,
 Frey

December 1, 1901

I have read, dear G. V., your letter about Finn’s article.
You have proved much stricter. It seemed to me that the
article was not a bad one. But your arguments have fully
convinced me, and I agree to the amputation. I have already
spoken to the author about the need for some changes and
cuts. He did not resist absolutely, but expressed the “wish”
that the cuts should not be too heavy, as otherwise, he
said, he would find someone else to publish the article.

We shall try to write to the author: we have the address,
but it’s not very convenient to write.

However, I will not undertake to correct the article.
That will have to be your job, if the decision is to
carry it.

Best wishes,
 Yours,
 Frey

Your criticism of Finn’s article has made me think again
of how poor Iskra’s economic section is, a fact you spoke
of at Zurich. Why don’t you send us anything for this
section? It would be so important to have anything from notes
of half a column (4,000 letters, 4-6 of your pages) about
current events, like the co-operative congress, new data
about syndicates, economic reviews in The Economist,
major strikes, fresh statistical data, etc., etc., to articles of
1 1/2–2 columns, or feature articles up to 20–25 thousand
letters (up to 30 of your pages)! You seem to be more in
touch with economic literature than anyone else, so it would

    

be easiest for you to draw up such notes, even occasionally!
Do try and help us, or Iskra will become monotonous. Of
course I would not even dream of distracting you from your
work on the programme, which is urgently needed and
has first priority; but it would be possible to write small
notes and little articles in between, about the new issues
of economic journals, etc.

Iskra’s historical section is also weak: feature articles
telling about the European revolutions, and so forth. I
think that here we could even translate. Please send us
suitable material; you once said you had something in
view.

Yours,
 Frey

I am still unwell, and “struggling” with the pamphlet
against Rabocheye Dyelo, which is advancing almost in
crab-like fashion.

December 19, 1901

Dear G. V.,

I have just received your letter of the 17th, and am
replying at once. I replied to you over a week ago about the
trip to
Brussels,[1] sending the long letter to P. B. (since
it also included the plan for No. 4 of Zarya) with a request
to send it on to you immediately. If the letter has not been
lost, it is a scandal that he has delayed it! I am writing
to him immediately.

I support Alexei’s opinion that you must go. Krichevsky
can do us harm—and now that the decisive struggle is
beginning, we should keep an eye on him. We won’t be able
to get along with them.

I am sending you 230 marks: 80 marks=100 francs for
the International Bureau, and 150 marks for the trip. Will
that be enough?

Take a circular ticket (the period is 2 months) with a
break at Munich (if it’s imprudent to do so from Geneva,
order it in Zurich). At Zurich persuade P. B. to come too.
Then we shall all be together at the beginning of January,
and shall have done both with the programme (this is
important) and with No. 4 of Zarya, etc.

I am expecting Zarya any day now. I already sent P. B.
its contents in that letter.

Write a little report or a note for Iskra on the sessions
of the International Secretariat.

Every good wish,
 Yours,
 Frey

Reply whether you will be here.

G. V. Plekhanov attended the I.S.B. conference in Brussels on
December 30, 1901 (Plekhanov and B. N. Krichevsky were
elected to the Bureau at the Paris Congress of the Second International
in 1900). Iskra No. 15 of January 15, 1902, carried Plekhanov’s
report on the conference, entitled “From Brussels. A Letter to
Iskra’s Editorial Board”.

... I have always said that the distribution of functions
tends to resolve of itself: over here, the literature is
published, articles are written for the paper, etc. In Russia,
the literature is distributed and contacts are established.
Transport is handled by special persons, appointed by
mutual agreement of those here and there, and connected
with-both sides. Such is the ideal....

... We have long been concerned over the fact that
organisation in Russia (a matter of first-rate importance) has
been making such slow headway, and, you will recall, we
even sent you a “plan” last
summer[1] (unfortunately we
have not kept a copy of the letter elaborating the “plan”).
But you replied: “We have no men.” You now seem to have
found it possible to get down to this, and we are all ready,
of course, to help all of you, if it depends on us. But our
role here is quite a subordinate one. You are connected
with
X. Y. Z.[2]; consequently, all the “sources” of
literature are within your reach. Establish contacts with one
another, and turn these sources to use; if you find people
who are suitable and have earned your complete confidence,
make up a management committee from among them by
joint agreement and we shall of course write to everyone
we can to have them abide by the committee’s instructions.
What is essential though is that the management committee
should without fail have in view the whole of Russia, and
not by any means one district only, because Iskra’s whole
future depends on whether it will be able to overcome local
rule-of-thumb work and district separateness, and become
an all-Russia paper in practice....

February 18, 1902

Dear L. I.,

In reply to your letter, I hasten to tell you that the
articles by Struve and Bulgakov appeared in the May 1897
issue of Novoye Slovo (No. 8, according to their special
numbering).[1]

We are very glad that you will be finishing the article
soon—please send the articles of Struve and Bulgakov
along with it.

Have you made any use of the articles by Vl. Chernov
in the latest issues of Russkoye Bogatstvo on the subjective
method, Berdayev, etc.? What a good thing it would be
to devote even a few lines to giving this chatterbox
a dressing down! In No. 2 (February) of Sozialistische
Monatshefte[2] someone called Lozinsky also tries to bury
materialism and extols Berdayev.

We hear from Vologda (where Berdayev and Bogdanov
are doing time) that the exiles there engage in earnest
discussions of philosophy, and that Berdayev, as the one
who knows most about it, appears to be “winning”.

Every good wish,
 Yours....

Lenin informed Lyubov Axelrod of the publication of the articles
by P. B. Struve and S. N. Bulgakov and sent her the clippings
from Novoye Slovo (New Word), Vol. 8, May 1897. Axelrod used
the material in her article, “Some Philosophical Exercises by
Certain ‘Critics’”, which was directed against Struve and
Bulgakov, and appeared in Zarya No. 4, August 1902.

March 22, 1902

Dear P. B.,

How is your health after your journey? Have you
recovered from the life of a wanderer, and from the
“reaction” you expected when you were going away?

Velika Dmitrievna sent you G. V.’s programme and our
scheme for a “settlement in
committee”,[2] through a
committee of arbitration sui generis. This scheme seems to be
falling through because of G. V.’s unwillingness, but I
don’t yet know this for certain. I should like to know your
impression of G. V.’s new draft and which of the two drafts
you now favour.

The copying of your
pamphlet[3] has only just been
started: up to now the copyist was busy with copying for
Iskra (with Tsvetov away, Iskra has been making very slow
headway: only one issue will appear in March). Evidently
delay is inevitable if your pamphlet is to be published here;
but if you are very much opposed to this, let me know, and
we may then send it on to Geneva. If speed is not so
important for you, then as soon as the copying is finished and
Tsvetov returns, the pamphlet will be sent to the printers.

A few more words about the programme. We consider
it very undesirable to put it up for a vote by the whole
League (instead of the editorial board alone),
respective[1]

have a discussion in the press among ourselves (although
this will not be easy to avoid if the attempt to reach
agreement fails). What is your opinion?

All the very best wishes for your health.

Yours....
 

Notes

[2]
A reference to the second draft Party Programme drawn up by
Plekhanov.

The “settlement in committee ” consisted in agreeing two draft
programmes—Lenin’s and Plekhanov’s—in a co-ordinating
committee appointed by the Iskra Editorial Board to work out a single
draft programme of the R.S.D.L.P. Prospective members for the
committee were Martov, Zasulich, Dan or Deutsch (see Lenin
Miscellany II, pp. 91–92).

The draft agreement did not “fall through”, as Lenin had feared:
Plekhanov agreed to a settlement in committee, and the agreed
draft was approved by the Iskra Editorial Board in Zurich
on April 14, 1902, in Lenin’s absence. The draft Programme of
the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, worked out by the
Editorial Board of Iskra and Zarya, was published in Iskra No. 21
on June 1, 1902.





[3]
A reference to P. B. Axelrod’s article which he intended to issue
in pamphlet form as a supplement to Iskra. The article, entitled
“The Emergence in Our Country of Bourgeois Democracy as an
Independent Revolutionary Force”, appeared only in 1906 in
a collection of his articles, The Struggle of Socialist and
Bourgeois Trends in the Russian Revolutionary Movement.

March 27, 1902

Dear P. B.,

I have just received your letter, and hasten to reply.
I very much like your idea of printing the article in Zarya,
instead of as a pamphlet (a supplement to Iskra), both in
general and in particular, on account of our plans for moving
to London (Yevgeny is writing to you about
it).[2] About
half of your article is already copied, and I shall send it
to you directly it is finished: the work of copying is going
ahead quickly now. It will be a fine thing to have a
magazine-type article in Zarya. As for the changes that may be
required on account of the letter being addressed “to Iskra”,
they will be insignificant.

No one, so far as I am aware, has begun or intends to
write any review on Kanun
revolutsii.[3] Therefore please
do write it: what we are short of in Zarya is reviews.

As for the programme, I will send you my comments on
G. V.’s draft in a few days (my sick friend now has
them)[4];
I showed them to my friends here, and they persuaded me
not to send them to G. V., in view of the proposals which
had been made for an “arbitration or conciliation”
committee. But I would be very happy to send them to you
personally to show you my 
Bedenken[1]

set forth therein
systematically. As regards our
meeting,[5] however, I don’t
think it could bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion
just at present. I don’t know what the whole board will
decide (we shall be acquainting it with your plan this very
day), but I personally very much fear that in the absence

    

of an already prepared third draft, in the absence of a new
make-up of those voting, in the absence of any firm
agreement on how to vote, who is to vote and what significance is
to be attached to the voting, our Zurich meeting would once
again be inconclusive. And you are a thousand times right
about the importance of issuing a programme.

Have you seen Borba’s
Kalendar[6]? How did you like it?

No. 4 of Revolutsionnaya
Rossiya[7] has appeared.
That’s hard work!

Forgive me for the brevity and hastiness of this letter.
I am in a great hurry.

Yours....
 

Notes
 

[1]
Considerations.—Ed.
 



[2]
The departure of the Munich section of Iskra’s Editorial Board
(Lenin, V. I. Zasulich and Y. O. Martov; A. N. Potresov was
unwell and stayed in Switzerland) for London was discussed in
March 1902 when it was informed that the Russian and German
police had got wind of the publication of Iskra in Germany. In
late March, the question was settled and Lenin and N. K.
Krupskaya left Munich for London on April 12. Martov and Zasulich
arrived later.





[3]
Kanun revolutsii (Eve of Revolution)—a non-periodical
publication of the Svoboda (Freedom) group, edited by Y. 0. Zelensky
(L. Nadezhdin). No review of its No. 1 appeared in Zarya.





[4]
A reference to Lenin’s notes on G. V. Plekhanov’s second draft
programme (see present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 37–57) the MS. of which
was kept by A. N. Potresov until April 2. For Potresov’s opinion
of Lenin’s notes, see Lenin Miscellany II, pp. 105–07.





[5]
A “Congress” or meeting of Iskra’s editorial board was proposed
in P. B. Axelrod’s letter to Lenin of March 25, 1902 (see Lenin
Miscellany II, pp. 99–101). Lenin refused to attend. The meeting
between G. V. Plekhanov, V. I. Zasulich, P. B. Axelrod and
Y. O. Martov was held in Zurich on April 14, 1902, where they

   

discussed and adopted a draft programme worked out by a
commission, which had adopted Plekhanov’s draft as a basis but with
amendments suggested in Lenin’s counter-draft and remarks.





[6]
Sotsial-Demokratichesky Kalendar na 1902 god (Social-Democratic
Calendar for 1902) was issued by the Borba group in Geneva in
1902.





[7]
Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia)—an illegal
paper of the League of Socialist-Revolutionaries published in
Russia from late 1900 (No. 1 dated 1900 actually appeared in January
1901). It was published in Geneva from January 1902 to December
1905 as an organ of the S.R. Party.

Dear Comrades,

We are very glad about your proposal for the publication
of pamphlets. There is, in fact, a certain lack of pamphlets,
and we could easily publish them in any quantity. (As
regards transport, we cannot at the moment guarantee
regular delivery en masse, but we hope that this too will be
constantly improving.) However we beg you not to insist on
the stipulation that pamphlets should be accepted or
rejected en bloc, without any partial changes at all. This
stipulation is extremely inconvenient, and will hold up
everything terribly. Take the very first article sent to us, about
organisation (the technical problems of organisation). In
the general opinion of the editorial board, this article (
interesting and valuable though it is) cannot appear in this
shape, because it contains quite inappropriate and tactless
remarks (like “one-man rule” and “dictatorship by one
member of the committee”, etc.); and there are also minor
defects requiring correction. Yet an agreement about such
changes, not particularly essential from the author’s
standpoint (but unquestionably necessary), could be reached
without any difficulty at all. Think this over well, and
don’t hold up an important undertaking out of a desire
to impose particularly restrictive conditions on us.

We repeat that the article is, on the whole, practical
and valuable; in general, we are even prepared to agree to
the stipulation that articles should be accepted or rejected
as a whole, without partial corrections. But, then, under
this stipulation, we should be obliged to reject your very
first article, and that would be harmful to the cause. After
all, it would surely be possible to come to an agreement

    

with the author about any partial corrections. Why don’t
you try and let us make these corrections by way of
experiment? If you like we shall write to you in greater detail
about what precisely should be changed.

And so your task now is to turn yourself into a committee
for preparing the
congress,[1] to accept the Bundist into
this committee (after assessing him from every angle—
this N.B.!), and to push your own people through into
the largest number of committees possible, safeguarding
yourself and your people more than the apple of your eye,
until the congress. Remember: all this is of the utmost
importance! Be bolder, more pushy and more inventive in
this respect, and in all others, as discreet and as careful
as possible.

Wise as serpents—and (with the committees: the
Bund[2]
and St. Petersburg) harmless as doves.

Yours ever,
 Starik
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the re-establishment of the Organising Committee
for convening the Party’s Second Congress, as the first committee,
elected at the Belostok conference, had nearly all been arrested.
N.K. Krupskaya, informing F.V. Lengnik of this, wrote in her letter:
“Of all those elected to the committee for preparing the Congress,
only one man, a Bundist, escaped arrest. We are sending him to
you, and the two of you will have to make preparations for the
Congress. But you must be diplomatic with him and not show
your hand” =

(see Lenin Miscellany VIII, p. 238). In this way
Lengnik was to be co-opted to the Organising Committee. A
month later, Lenin wrote about it to I. I. Radchenko in St. 
Petersburg (see pp. 113–14).

The “Bundist” was K. Portnoi.





[2]
Bund—General Jewish Workers’ Union of Lithuania, Poland
and Russia; was founded in 1897. It consisted mainly of Jewish
handicraftsmen from Russia’s Western regions. The Bund
conducted a nationalist and separatist policy in the Russian
working-class movement. Inside the R.S.D.L.P. it supported
opportunist and Menshevik views.

caution. Take on yourself the greatest possible number
of districts in which you undertake to prepare for the
congress, refer to the bureau (giving it some other name), in
a word, make sure that the whole thing is entirely in your
hands, leaving the Bund, for the time being, confined to
the Bund. We shall begin negotiations here about a
rapprochement over here, and will inform you immediately.

And so, for the time being, have in mind the composition
of a Russian Committee for Preparing the Congress which is
most advantageous for us (you may find it convenient to say
that you have already formed this committee, and are very
glad to have the Bund participate or something like this).
Take on yourself, without fail, to be secretary in this
committee. These are the first steps. And then we shall see.

I say have the composition “in mind” to have as free a
hand as possible: don’t commit yourself to the Bund right
away (you can say, for example, that connections have been
established with the Volga, the Caucasus, the centre—we
have a man from over there—and the South—we’re sending
two down there), and make yourself master of the
undertaking. But do all this most carefully, without rousing
objections.

Write whether your role is clear to you. Perhaps we
shall yet have time to exchange letters.

Make certain to send the weekly paper regularly to
Rögner’s address: we need the most regular correspondence.

    

And we should like to send a special weekly: let us have
as quickly as possible the address of a doctor, a technician,
a cyclist, an artiste, and so on, and so forth.

Yours ever....

July 2, 1902

Dear G. V.,

Excuse my writing in such a hurry. I have come here to
Brittany for a rest (I am awaiting my family here as
well),[1]
but in Paris Berg gave me his item, and I have received the
article over the signature of Veteran which you sent.

I am completely in agreement with Veteran. On account
of the note about Lekkert in Iskra I had a little battle with
Berg and Velika Dmitrievna, who both, as usual, had an
attack of nerves, and began to talk about the inevitability
of terror, and the need for us to express this (in one way
or another). The item in Iskra was thus a compromise:
that was all I managed to
secure.[2]

Now Berg himself has become more resolutely opposed to
terror, even that of the Lekkerts.

But the question is whether it is all right to insert your
article with the Veteran signature. Of course, if you wish,
it will certainly go in (and there is time for it to go into
the next issue)—but wouldn’t it be better for you to turn
it into a leading article for No. 22, combining it, so to
speak, with Berg’s article “How to Fight”? I enclose this
article which, in my opinion, contains passages requiring
corrections, passages which are undesirably evasive on the
question of Lekkert.

I also enclose an item about the priest’s letter. What
is your opinion?

And so please reply as soon as possible, dear G. V., and
send all three articles straight back to London (J. Richter,
30. Holford Sq. 30. Pentonville: London W. C.). Write to
me at the same address.
 

I think a leader would be the best place to say what you
do say: the substance of the matter will be brought out
(the “objection” to Iskra will be smoothed out) and the
integral impression will be made stronger. You will find
it easy and natural to develop your article into a leader,
thereby substituting it for the article “How to Fight”.
Such a substitution would, in my opinion, be the best result.

All good wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
From the end of June to mid–July 1902, Lenin lived in Loguivy
(on the northern coast of France) together with his mother, M. A.
Ulyanova, and his sister, A. I. Yelizarova.

A reference to an unsigned editorial note to a letter from Vilna
(about the mass corporal punishment of demonstrators arrested
on May Day). It was published in Iskra No. 21, June 1, 1902,
in the “From Our Social Life” section, and dealt with the attempt
on the life of the Vilna Governor von Wal by the worker G. D.
Lekkert (Lekukha). Lenin and Iskra had repeatedly exposed the
harmful effect of individual acts of terrorism on the mass
workers’ movement, and in the event censured Martov and Zasulich
who approved of Lekkert’s act.

Further on, there is a reference to G. V. Plekhanov’s article
on Lekkert’s act, which was to be published in Iskra’s next issue.

   

Plekhanov accepted Lenin’s proposal and wrote an editorial for
Iskra No. 22, entitled “The Russian Working Class and the Police
Whipping”.

July 16, 1902

I enclose a letter to Arkady.

I received today your letter, the proofs and the money.
Merci.

There is some damned muddle altogether about this
“congress” in
Switzerland.[2] Who was it (first of all) who
thought of a “congress”? Not we. It was probably invented
by B. N., who ought really to be given a good head-washing
for irresponsible behaviour (his tour of Europe, his idle talk
with Korenevsky about the congress, etc.); if you haven’t
done it already, please give him a thorough talking to.
I was thinking of doing it myself, but I suppose you will do
it better, because I am very angry.

No one is arranging a “congress”: a congress requires
that everyone should be there (whereas we know nothing for
sure about Arkady and
Sonya[3]). A “congress” requires
some of those abroad (like Dimka, the old fellows, maybe
Alexandrova and others), and that has not even been
mentioned. No one has even been preparing a programme for a
congress, and no one knows what to talk about at one: About
the Iskra organisation in Russia? Without any delegates
from that organisation itself? All of this is amazingly hasty
and ill-considered!

L. Gr. himself is now postponing it “until the autumn”.
Will you, too, help to “blast” this “congress” nonsense?
It is essential right away to see Lapot: he will both see the
Swiss and will himself come and see us. What else is there?
Then there’s Povar, who evidently still needs some training—
so let him study at Zurich: that will be excellent. Maybe
he, like B. N., will remain abroad for months?! Why hurry

    

to see him, then? When he wants to go, he himself will have
to come and see us, so there is no need to drag him over now.
And what is this nonsense that B. N. and V. V. have been
writing to Berg? “We can’t talk except in the presence of
P. B.” Talk with whom? Povar? He is at P. B.’s. With
the three persons? They are at P. B.’s. With Lapot? He
will be visiting P. B. Advise Berg to give V. V. and B. N.
a thorough bawling-out for this nonsense, and write to
me what Berg thinks about it, and whether there is any
hope that he himself will reply to them in a way that will
discourage them from talking nonsense. Besides, P. B.
himself went to Munich, and will come to London as well.
No one doubts that a visit from G. V. is (will be) necessary.

I wrote to G. V. that I know nothing about a “congress”,
but that it is essential to have a business-like meeting (with
Lapot and others) in London, where, of course, he also
will be. If necessary, I will write to him again.

Try pressing L. Gr. in every way in order to dissuade
him: he has no clear idea of who is to attend this “congress”,
for what purpose it is to be held, and how it is to proceed.

Yours....

I suppose it is not necessary to return the proofs, n’est-ce
pas?[1]


And what about V. I.’s article, hasn’t it been set?



{{ 
Please don’t forget: there is a quotation from
Bulgakov in my agrarian article: Vol.? p.? It should
not be left in this form, and if I don’t return earlier, and
don’t see the proofs again, cross out not the whole footnote,
but only the words:
“Vol.—p.—”.[4]
 

Notes
 

[1]
Isn’t that so?—Ed.
 



[2]
Lenin’s letter makes it clear that L. D. Deutsch, a member of
the League’s administration, intended to call (in Switzerland)
a congress of Iskra workers in Russia considering that, at that
time, some of them, including P. N. Lepeshinsky, V. A. Noskov
and F. I. Shchekoldin, were abroad. The idea of the congress must
have come from Noskov and Shchekoldin, members of the
Northern League of the R.S.D.L.P., who were in Zurich and who had
made a number of proposals concerning the organisation of Iskra
(see present edition, Vol. 34, pp.110–13). Lepeshinsky also favoured
a congress, as did G. V. Plekhanov and P. B. Axelrod. No
congress was held.

Sonya was the secret name for the Iskra centre in Samara.

A reference to the volume and page of S.N. Bulgakov’s book,
Capitalism and Agriculture, in a note to “The Agrarian
Programme of Russian Social-Democracy” (see present edition,

in Zarya No. 4.

A Letter to Arkady

Dear Friend,

I have read your long letter of
June 6[1]

over again, and
want to add something to my previous
letter.[2] I was very
glad indeed to have your report of a talk with the workers.
Such letters are a great rarity for us, and they really
invigorate us. Be sure to pass this on to your workers, with
our request that they themselves should write to us not
only for publication, but simply to exchange ideas and
not to lose contact and mutual understanding. I personally
am particularly interested, in this connection, in what the
workers will think of What Is To Be Done?, because I have
not yet had any views from workers.

And so give us a direct contact with your group of
workers, and also with
Manya[3]: this is very important, and
will very much consolidate both their closer approach
to Iskra and your own position among them. And then,
if there are really capable people among Manya’s leaders,
it would be a good thing for one of them to come and see us:
suggest this to them and find out what they think of it.

Then there are three more points.

(1) If
Vanya[4] is with us, how are you to determine
your relations with him? What is your opinion? Perhaps,
if Vanya and Manya are entirely on our side (and if they
issue the statement I wrote of—this is extremely important),
they could include you in their Central
Committee[5] and
in addition formally confirm you in your function for the
special work of unification on an all-Russia scale (i.e.,
“The Central Committee authorises N. N., who is one of its
members and a member of the Iskra organisation in
Russia, an organisation with which the C.C. is in complete

    

solidarity, to be in charge of work in preparation for Party
unity, in the Iskra spirit”).

Perhaps it might be varied in this way (of course I am
suggesting all this only tentatively, no more): “The C.C.
of the St. Petersburg Committee, expressing its complete
solidarity with the Iskra organisation in Russia, is happy
to co-opt to the Committee, with its full consent, a group
of persons belonging to that organisation and specially
engaged in transporting Iskra and distributing it 
throughout Russia. The C.C. assigns such-and-such members to
assist this group and allocates such-and-such funds, and
one of the members of this group (Arkady) enters the C.C.
of the St. Petersburg Committee, while remaining a member
of the Iskra organisation in Russia, and takes special charge
of preparations for all-Party unity in the Iskra spirit.”
By the group I mean the persons you sent for
fish,[6] etc.
I repeat that I am only suggesting various acceptable and
possible propositions, in fulfilment of your request to
suggest a “concrete draft of a plan”, and leaving it to your
discretion to make use of my suggestions in one form or
another. Be sure to write how things stand at present, and
in what direction you are moving them. Strike the iron
while it is hot, and remember that we have to come to
a mutual agreement in as detailed a form as possible about
the plan for finally and irrevocably winning over the “
tuning fork” (=the St. Petersburg Committee=Vanya). And
you must be as wise as a serpent with your young friends!

If this is possible, it would be best of all. Then you would
be a delegate from Vanya in the Organising Committee
(preparing for
Sasha[7]), and one more of our people could
be in it from Sonya. Write as soon as you can what you
think of all this, and whether you have talked about it with
Vanya and with Manya.

(2) It is you who must without fail set up an Organising
Committee in Russia, and take it into your own hands: you
on behalf of Vanya, Claire on behalf of Sonya+one more of
our people from the South—that is the ideal. Be extremely
careful and restrained with the Bund, without showing your
hand, and letting it deal with Bundist affairs but not allowing
it to stick its nose into Russian affairs: remember that there
you have an unreliable friend (and maybe even an enemy).
 

(3) Explain to everyone everywhere that it is pure
gossip that Iskra’s editorial board itself wants to become the
Russian Party’s C.C. It is nonsense. The C.C. can exist only
in the field of operations, and our hope is that it will
develop out of the Organising Committee and revolutionary
workers. The relationship between Iskra’s editorial board
and the C.C. would be determined by the division of
functions principle (ideological leadership and practical
direction), with regular congresses serving to ensure unity, or
possibly the attachment of one of the five (as an assumption)
members of the C.C. here as a permanent delegate. The
gossip is being spread by Borba, and it must be exposed.
We don’t want to reply in print to these rogues: the best
way to punish them is for Iskra to be silent.

Perhaps Vanya’s doubts (about which you wrote) are also
due to his vague idea of all this? Make sure that both Vanya
and still more Many a are quite clear about it.

All the very best, and hopes above all that you will
manage to hold out.

Yours,
 Lenin

[P.S. If it should come into Vanya’s head to demand a
precise definition of relations between Manya and himself,
between his members and the members of Manya who are
in the St. Petersburg C.C., I think this would be best 
postponed until we meet here, and that Vanya should be told
straight: “One of two things—either we really see eye to
eye; and then a month of work together will see us working
so smoothly that there will not remain the slightest shadow
of misunderstanding between us, because we shall all be
Iskrists. Or else we shall find ourselves in disagreement—
in which case we shall part ways in a proper manner.
But we don’t want to look silly once again by drawing
up agreements, etc.!”
From your letter of June 6 I see
that you replied to them at the outset in this sense, and
of course it was an excellent thing to do.]

September 27, 1902

I have received your letter. Many thanks for your
detailed reply. Until Viscount arrives I will not, as you wish,
either raise the general question of finance or give any
information about your letter, except in general terms, i.e.,
neither about how you define the body of “holders”,
nor about what amount you specify, nor about how soon
you can provide it (the whole immediately, or in
instalments). We shall, in any case, have
vertrauliche[1]

talks
with Viscount about all the most important questions;
so it will be best for me first of all to show him your letter,
and to decide jointly with him on the limits, so to speak,
of any further information about its contents.

I personally incline to the view that for the time being
it would be best not to tell anyone about the whole amount
(to keep it secret), nor to tell absolutely anyone about the
possibility of obtaining it all at once, because at the
present moment there’s an infinity of “possible” expenditure
on “possible” undertakings. The abundance of escapes is
putting a mass of people at Iskra’s “disposal”, provided
all of them are given maintenance, but if we start this on
a grand scale, frivolously and in haste, we shall find
ourselves “on the rocks” within six months or a year. On the
other hand, if we are more “tight-fisted”, a fairly large
number of peripheral undertakings manage “to make do
with their own resources”. In view of this, it is best to
arrange matters in the old way (i.e., to speak to all those
who participate in this way): you can provide a good deal

    

yet, let us say, “over 10 thousand”, but, first, not all at
once, and second, you wish to provide only in extreme
necessity, advising them to seek regular sources to cover
current expenses themselves. I repeat that so far this is
my personal opinion, and I don’t yet know Viscount’s
opinion. We wanted to raise the question with him here about
some “amicable”, “friendly” division of functions,
starting from the principle that after all it is better to take
advantage of peace to bring about a stable modus vivendi
than to postpone matters once more until some “accidental”
conflict. But whether this will succeed, whether we shall
decide in this way, whether it will be convenient to raise
the question—all this is still unknown.

At present, we are very hard up for money, and there
are some urgent expenses. Therefore, please send 2,000 marks
immediately, if possible: what you can, of this amount,
at once, and what you have to draw, as soon as possible
(and let us know when it will arrive). But in my opinion you
should already draw a larger amount: draw some 3,000
rubles and keep it at home, so that we could get it from
you at short notice. Otherwise we literally don’t know how
to get out of it: we already owe 150 rubles, and are putting
off a payment of 50 rubles next week. We need about 300
rubles for departures (quite essential), about 200 for the
people here soon, etc. Write as soon as you can what
arrangements you have made, when and how much you will
be receiving.

I shall pass on what you say to Brock. There is a crowd
of people here, and altogether too much commotion. Yet
many more are arriving in the next few days!

You write nothing about your plans for coming here, and
very vaguely about your health: only that you don’t feel
well, but what is the matter? I am also worried about the
lack of news from home.

Well, my best wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin

NIZHNI-NOVGOROD WORKERS IN COURT

We reprint the speeches of the Nizhni-Novgorod workers
from the lithographed leaflet issued by the Nizhni-Novgorod
Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.
To add anything to these speeches would only mean
weakening the impression created by this ingenuous account of the
workers’ misery, of the growing indignation among them
and of their readiness to fight. It is now our duty to make
every effort to have these speeches read by tens of thousands
of Russian workers. The example of Zalomov, Bykov,
Samylin, Mikhailov and their comrades, who courageously
stood up in court for their fighting call: “Down with the
autocracy!”, will inspire the whole working class of Russia
to equally heroic and resolute struggle for the freedom of
the whole people, and the freedom of steady working-class
advance to the bright socialist future.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Speeches in the tsarist court were delivered on October 28–31
(November 10–13), 1902, by P. A. Zalomov, A. I. Bykov, M. I.
Samylin and a number of other workers from Sormovo and
Nizhni-Novgorod who were put on trial for their participation in the
demonstrations on May 1 and 5 (14 and 18), 1902. Out of 23 
organisers and leaders of the demonstration who had been arrested,
13 were sentenced to exile in Siberia for life. The speeches were
initially published by the Nizhni-Novgorod Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P. as leaflets, and then reprinted in Iskra No. 29 on
December 1, 1902, under the title “Nizhni-Novgorod Workers
on Trial”, with a preface by Lenin.


For Lenin’s assessment of their behaviour at the trial see
present edition, Vol. 6, pp. 282–83.

December 1, 1902

Dear Georgi Valentinovich,

I was already going to inquire why you were silent, when
I received your letter. Your requests will be fulfilled.

Why do you say nothing either
(1) about a topic for Iskra
or
(2) about a feature article on
Tarasov[3]? Did you not
get my letter from Berne? Please reply as soon as possible
whether you intend to write a leading article for Iskra
on this or some similar theme. [As soon as possible,
because No. 28 is ready and the setting of No. 29 has begun.
In No. 28, there is a leading article by Vera Ivanovna
against the S.R.s to show that they are distorting history by
their inventions that no politicians were insulted in the
period of Narodnaya
Volya,[4] etc. The heading is: “Le
mort saisit le

To Kurtz

January 17, 1903

Yesterday we received Kievski S.-D. Listok No. 1, dated
November 30 (sic!), through an outsider. It is simply a
scandal that our Iskrists always lag behind! Why didn’t Zarin
send us this leaflet in time? Why hasn’t he written a single
word about this undertaking? We implore Zarin to link
us up directly with some member of the Committee,
someone who is conscientious and mobile and who knows
everything that is going on. Every leaflet (whoever issues
it) must be sent immediately to two different addresses in
two copies, one in an envelope, another wrapped up in a
Russian newspaper. Then we must immediately be given
contact with Vakar. We are very much afraid that the Kiev
Iskrists, owing to their inactivity and onlooker attitude,
will suffer the same fate as that of the St. Petersburg
Iskrists. Not a word either about receipt and distribution
(N.B.) of the literature! This is a desperate situation!

Why don’t you reply to No. 16 of Rabochaya Mysl,
published in Geneva, apparently by Nadezhdin? Are you really
going to let this pass too without a protest? What a scandal
that leaflet No. 1 of Rabochaya Mysl was
burned[1]: of
course, there were some things in it that needed correcting,
and drastically at that. But then why wasn’t it done? It’s
quite incomprehensible what is going on at your end! Why
has the printed leaflet on the 200th anniversary of the press
been
delayed[2]? Send us immediately every leaflet, your
own and other people’s, workers’ and students’, all without
exception, with a note saying whether they may be quoted
and whether they were distributed—two copies of each to
two addresses, either simply in envelopes or wrapped up
inside a legal newspaper sent by book-post, only with a
strong wrapper crosswise.

Why don’t you send to Iskra the St. Petersburg
Committee reports of the money you collect? Be sure to do
this. There is great need of workers’ letters from St. 
Petersburg; please do your best to get some, especially about
unemployment, and then about the impression created by
our literature.

Correct leaflet No. 1 of Rabochaya Mysl, rewriting it
in a more restrained and more business-like tone, and be
sure to publish the story of the split within the Committee.
Nadezhdin’s Rabochaya Mysl cannot, I emphasise, cannot
be let off without a public protest.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Rabochaya Mysl (Worker’s Thought) No. 16, November–
December 1902, carried a “Protest of the Workers’ Organisation
Committee” against the St. Petersburg Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.
which had acknowledged Iskra and Zarya as the Party’s leading
organs. The same issue had a letter from the Workers’ Organisation
Committee to the Svoboda (Freedom) group and the editorial board
of the magazine Otkliki (Comment), expressing gratitude for their
sympathy and offering support. The pro-Iskra St. Petersburg
Committee issued, in place of Rabochaya Mysl, its Listok
Rabochei Mysli (Rabochaya Mysl Leaflet) in December 1902 and
January 1903. Listok No. 1 was destroyed by a committee decision
in view of its poor wording.





[2]
The first Russian newspaper, Vedomosti o voyennykh i inykh delakh,
dostoinykh znaniya i pamyati, sluchivshikhsya v Moskovskom
gosudarstve i vo inykh okrestnykh stranakh (Recorder of Military
and Other Affairs in the Moscow State and Neighbouring Countries
Worthy of Knowledge and Memory), was published on January 2,
1703. =

To mark its bicentenary, the St. Petersburg Committee of
the R.S.D.L.P. issued a leaflet, “Two Centuries of a Press in
Bondage”, on January 3, 1903, branding Russia’s disgraceful
censorship, and describing the struggle for freedom of the press
(from Radishchev to Herzen). It also noted the wide spread of
illegal revolutionary publications in late 19th and early 20th
centuries, and called for a struggle against the tsarist
government.

To Claire and Boris from Starik

Dear Friends,

Kurtz is writing to you about yesterday’s
meeting.[1]
There is no longer any hope, absolutely no hope of peace.
You can’t imagine even a tenth of the outrages to which the
Martovites have sunk here, poisoning the whole atmosphere
abroad with their spiteful gossip, encroaching on our
contacts, money, literary material, etc. War has been declared,
and they (Lyuba, Kostya, Yeryoma) are already on their
way to fight in Russia. Get ready for the most legal but
desperate struggle. We must by all means fill the places
on all committees without exception with our own people.
Special attention should be paid to Kharkov,
Yekaterinoslav and Rostov. Is it true that the Kiev Committee has
adopted a resolution backing the Minority? Is that
possible? Why weren’t we told earlier?

I would very strongly advise you to co-opt Konyaga and
Ignat. You will soon see and get to know the former. About
the latter I will say this: in wartime he is, truly, useful
and essential; he will be quite loyal; he can be kept away
from functions for which he is not fit; there is much idle
gossip about him; there is no need to fear that he will
co-opt God knows whom, because Kurtz will be staying here,
and we shall take care of him. I repeat that I strongly
advise you to take in Ignat, but, of course, it is entirely up to
you; I have made Ignat give me a solemn promise that he
would obey his chiefs in all things (and admitted to him
that he should be prepared for not being co-opted).

Please be sure to get the Bureau to function properly,

    

so that we should get weekly letters from you. I would ask
you even more earnestly to have Brutus go underground:
it’s not worth while perishing cheaply. Let him travel
all over the place in the next two or three months, and then
come here to replace Kurtz. This step is really essential.
We have seen Lebedev. Ruben is here also.

Gurvich and Khinchuk are Martovites.

Hurry up with your reply about the Council. You should
at once make a formal appointment of one more member
representing you, and he should transfer his vote to Kurtz.
Please don’t delay.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the meeting of all six members of the former Iskra
Editorial Board and F. V. Lengnik, a member of the Central
Committee, on the question of agreement. Lenin and Plekhanov
tried to co-opt Y. O. Martov to the editorial board and get other
former Menshevik editors and contributors to Iskra to work on it,
but they failed because the Mensheviks demanded the co-optation
of all four former editors. Lenin saw the “absurdity” of the demand

   

and abandoned the idea of negotiations. However, on October 
4, 1903, Plekhanov made another effort to co-opt two
editors but this was also rejected. For details on the October 4
meeting and the subsequent correspondence, see present edition,
Vol. 7, pp. 349–57.

Copy of a Reply

Addressed to Potresov (for Dan)

December 2, 1903

“Dear Comrade,

“The elimination of the personal conflict between
Martov and myself could be confirmed in an annex to the
minutes of the League’s
Congress.[1] For my part, I should
only welcome it. But no one has either the formal or the
moral right to abbreviate anything in the minutes of the
Congress, or to delete anything from the description of what
took place.”

With comradely greetings,
 N. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the “personal conflict” between Lenin and Martov
at the League’s Second Congress, which amounted to the
following: Martov accused Lenin that in his report at the Congress he
had portrayed Martov as a liar and intriguer in presenting the
question of organising the C.O. Editorial Board at the Party’s
Second Congress. Accordingly, he challenged Lenin to appear
before a court of arbitration. Lenin protested against such
tactics, took up Martov’s challenge and, in his turn, challenged him
to appear before a court of arbitration on the issue. The conflict
was ironed out through the mediation of G. M. Krzhizhanovsky
during his stay abroad in the latter half of November 1903, by
means of an exchange of notes between Lenin and Martov. The
Editorial Board failed to meet Lenin’s wish that the two notes
should be published in an annex to the minutes of the League’s
Congress (see Letter to F. I. Dan of December 2, 1903).
The fact that the “personal conflict had been ironed out”
was certified only in an editorial footnote to the relevant
section of the minutes. It said: “The question of a court of
arbitration has been eliminated through an exchange of explanations
between Comrades Lenin and Martov which took place after the
League Congress 

__NOTE_149_NOTE__ Missing ” at end of quote.

(Minutes of the Second Congress of the League
of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad, p. 66). The
notes were later published in the Commentary to the Minutes
of the Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary
Social-Democracy Abroad, Geneva, 1904.

To Odessa

From Lenin, C.C. member abroad and member of the
Council

Comrades,

We have been informed privately that the majority of
the Nikolayev Committee is accused of incorrect
action.[1]
I should very much like to be clear on what happened. Be so
kind as to reply to me immediately yourselves (and ask for
an immediate reply to me also from the comrades who are
at present members of the Nikolayev Committee, passing
this letter on to them) on the following questions:

(1) Who were the members of the Nikolayev Committee
before the raid of March 8–9? A full list of conspirative
names is essential. How many members were there in all?
How many supported the Minority and how many the
Majority?

(2) Were all the members of the Nikolayev Committee
arrested on March 8–9? If not, how many remain? How many
belong to the Majority, and how many to the Minority?

(3) Was or was there not a formal resolution of the
Nikolayev Committee (before the raid of March 8–9) on the
nomination of candidates? If there was, when was it adopted,
how many candidates were nominated and who precisely
were they?

(4) Have there been arrests in the Nikolayev Committee
since March 8–9? What changes in its composition did each
of these arrests bring about?
 

(5) Were or were not Comrades S. and O. (members of the
Minority with whom there was a dispute) members of the
Nikolayev Committee before the raid? Did they or did they
not work in Nikolayev earlier? If they did, when, how
long, in what capacity, in which group, in which line, etc.?
When precisely did S. and O. come to Nikolayev?

(6) How many days after the wholesale arrests (March
8--9) did Comrade N. come to Nikolayev?

(7) What right had Comrade N. to declare Comrades 
S. and O. members of the Nikolayev Committee, without
consulting Comrades V. and A., members of the Nikolayev
Committee, and without obtaining their consent?

(8) Did Comrades S. and O. make any complaint about
being members of the Nikolayev Committee without any
appointment and without co-optation? If they did, please
state in detail on what grounds.

(9) What connections were Comrades S. and O. supposed
to hand over to Comrades V., N. and A.? Where did
Comrades S. and O. get these connections? Who gave these
connections to them, and when?

(10) Why did S. and O. not recognise Comrades V. and
A. as the Committee?

(11) What official organisations of the Nikolayev
Committee existed at the time of the raid of March 8–9, i.e.,
what groups of agitators, of organisers, of propagandists,
etc., and how many such groups? Please list all without
fail, and state how many members there were in each, how
many of the Minority and how many of the Majority?

(12) When was the group of agitators whose meeting of
10 on April 20 adopted a resolution in favour of the
Majority formed? Was it before the raid or after the raid? Was
its composition changed after the raid, and how precisely?
Did or did not this group (or some other groups) have a
formal or tacit right to nominate candidates for membership
of the local Committee?

(13) Do you happen to know from where, and with whose
help (in cash, etc.), S. and O. were sent?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Iskra No. 62 of March 15 carried a report on the Nikolayev
arrests in the “Chronicle of the Revolutionary Struggle” section:
“In the early hours of March 9, the printing press was confiscated
and the four men there arrested. In addition, the police arrested ...
many others.” =

Lenin set forth the essence of the conflict in the
Nikolayev Committee during the discussion of the question at
the Party Council’s meeting on June 18, 1904 (see present
edition, Vol. 7, pp. 440–41).

The names of the persons indicated in Lenin’s letter by their
initials, or the group of agitators, mentioned at the end of the
letter, have not been identified.

July 26, 1904

Dear Vladimir Dmitrievich,

Thank you for your letter of 23.7.04 about our
affairs.[2]
I reply point by point.

As regards general policy, I am still for an armed peace,
for retreats with protests (as we said in our talk with Nina
Lvovna in the presence of yourself and Martyn
Nikolayevich), in short, for our old tactics. Protest against every
infringement, publish, agitate, without giving them any
pretexts for the coup d’état which they desire. As to the
details of particular measures, you can judge better on the
spot.

That C.C. agents were not given any papers is the direct
fault of Boris, who was the last to
leave.[3] I have already
written to Martyn Nikolayevich that I advise him to 
explain to the C.O. editorial board the absurdity of demanding
the papers: tell them Boris has been written to twice, there
is a report about his arrest, so must we really wait six months
for a reply from Russia? Keep protesting—but de facto
you will still be carrying on everything.

As regards finance, I have the feeling that we were rash
in taking on the library: it’s not luxuries we need, it’s
sustenance. Do you remember my telling you this? And the
300 francs have been spent! Please, do be careful, don’t
let yourself be carried away by the
library,[4] keep your
mind on the cause as a whole.

My best greetings to Ignat. How does he feel?

I am terribly worried about Nina Lvovna. Write at
once if you hear anything.
 

To my mind, we must issue a reply to Plekhanov (in
pamphlet form, not as a leaflet, and with a short preface)
if the C.O. fails to publish it despite all our protests. And
don’t be late with this, or it will lose its
interest.[5]

Every good wish, and greetings to Vera Mikhailovna and
all our friends.

Yours,
 N. Lenin

Write to me (and send newspapers) to Meiringen,
postlagernd.[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
Poste restante.—Ed.
 



[2]
During the stay of Lenin and N. K. Krupskaya in the mountains
in July and August 1904 and the trip of V. A. Noskov (a member
of the Central Committee’s Section Abroad) to Russia, the
section was in the charge of V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich, M. N. Lyadov
and P. N. Lepeshinsky, the Central Committee’s agents abroad.
Bonch-Bruyevich was in charge of the C.C.’s forwarding office;
Lyadov was the treasurer, and Lepeshinsky, the deputy C.C.

   

representative abroad on connections with Iskra’s Editorial
Board. The agents consulted Lenin on all important questions
and transmitted to him all the correspondence coming from Russia.





[3]
A reference to the official written authorisation that was to have
been issued by the C.C. representatives abroad (Lenin and V. A.
Noskov) to the collegium of C.C. agents abroad in Geneva, to
conduct the business of the C.C.’s Section Abroad in the absence
of the C.C. members. V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich informed Lenin
of a fresh conflict with Iskra’s Editorial Board, who had refused
to deal with the C.C.’s agents abroad without such an official
document.





[4]
A Party library in Geneva was organised by the C.C.’s Section
Abroad and was run on members’ payments from special
collections. The 300 francs mentioned by Lenin had been borrowed by
the library from the Party treasury and soon repaid.





[5]
A reference to the open letter of 37 Bolsheviks (the Geneva group)
to Plekhanov on his reply to the open letter of M. N. Lyadov,
which the latter addressed to Plekhanov on June 1, 1904 in Iskra
No. 67, concerning his article in Iskra No. 66 (May 15, 1904),
“Silence Is No Longer Possible!”.

Plekhanov sharply criticised the activity of the C.C.’s
representatives abroad and invited C.C. members to repudiate Lenin
and his pamphlet One Step Forward, Two Steps Back. Lyadov
demanded that Plekhanov make public facts and documents
confirming his assessment of this activity, and also state the real
grounds for his demand that C.C. members repudiate Lenin.
Plekhanov replied to Lyadov in the same issue of Iskra in a rude
manner, but said nothing on the substance of Lyadov’s charges. This
prompted the group of Bolsheviks abroad to issue their open
letter, which stated that Plekhanov had declined to provide factual
confirmation of his charges against the C.C. and its representatives
abroad, and censured him for his behaviour in this case and
towards the majority of the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
in general.

Dear Vladimir Dmitrievich,

I have received your letter and hasten to reply. I simply
cannot understand why you fell out, and what the
point
is.[1] I don’t see why not sell 20–30 copies of Zarya and
why this should be “running ahead of things”. I should
think this was the kind of routine matter in forwarding
that could be left entirely to the manager of the forwarding
section, i.e., to you. I am writing this very day to Martyn
Nikolayevich asking him to try and clear up the
misunderstanding. You shouldn’t be too much upset about
individual expressions, even sharp ones, even unfair ones. You
see, surely, that we are all very edgy—the cause of it all
is the rotten situation created by the new traitors in the
C.C. Maybe we shall now soon put an end to all this, once
and for all, and make a fresh start—then the basis for petty
conflicts will disappear. In the meantime, we must try
and see it through patiently, and I would reply to caustic
remarks by jokes about “the deadly
destroyer”.[2] I quite
understand your irritation, but joking seems to be the only
answer. If a dispute arises, drag out its solution, write
to us here, that’s all you should do. Please take all possible
steps to accelerate the appearance of 


(1) the pamphlet by Ryadovoi and Galyorka, 

(2) your statement with the documents, 

(3) Galyorka’s pamphlet which was sent
today.[3]

How is Ilya? He visited me yesterday, I told him what
was in
hand,[4] but he still can’t make up his mind. Has
he been given my
(1) letter on the subject of the agreement
of 26.5.04[5];
(2) protest against the C.C.
declaration,[6]
and
(3) letter about the
protest[7]? It is absolutely essential
    

that he and all the compositors read this; don’t delay with
this.

Have matters been arranged about the co-operative
printing
press[8]? Hurry.

Ilya says there is a rumour that Glebov has a letter of
resignation from Travinsky. We shall look into it and
check.

They’re a nice lot, aren’t they? Five and four are
arguing; two of the five resign; two of the four are taken—
then the three, instead of resigning, stage a coup
d’état[9]!

Yours,
 N. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich sold for cash 30 copies of Zarya from the
C.C. forwarding office to Iskra’s, Editorial Board and M. N.
Lyadov protested against this.





[2]
The meaning of the words is not quite clear, but judging by the
context, they apparently refer to M. N. Lyadov.





[3]
The Bolshevik literature and documents mentioned here include: =

1) a pamphlet by Galyorka (M. S. Olminsky) and Ryadovoi (A. 
Bogdanov), Our Misunderstandings; =

2) a statement by V. D.
Bonch-Bruyevich concerning the start of publication of Bolshevik
Social-Democratic literature with a letter from Glebov (V. A. Noskov)
refusing to print this statement in the Party printing shop; and

   

3) a pamphlet by Galyorka, Down with Bonapartism! (Bonch–
Bruyevich s statement was printed on the last sheet of the pamphlet,
Our Misunderstandings, of the Geneva edition of 1904).





[4]
Lenin and “Ilya” (I. S. Vilensky) who was in charge of the Party’s
printing shop discussed the conflict between Lenin and the
conciliatory majority of the Central Committee on who was to run
the Party’s printing shop at Geneva.





[5]
The “agreement” on a joint solidarity statement abroad on
behalf of the Central Committee was concluded between Lenin and
V. A. Noskov, who came abroad as the C.C. representative abroad
and a second member of the Party Council. (He replaced F. V.
Lengnik, who returned to Russia.) The “agreement” was signed on
May 26 with the participation of M. M. Essen, a third member
of the C.C., who was abroad at the time (see present edition,
Vol. 7, pp. 430–31 and 426–29).





[6]
A reference to Lenin’s letter to five members of the Central
Committee in Russia with his motivated protest against the C.C.’s
“July Declaration” (see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 462–63).

July Declaration of the Central Committee—a resolution
adopted by the conciliatory members of the C.C., L. B. Krasin,
V. A. Noskov and L. Y. Galperin, in July 1904. It consisted of
26 points, nine of which were published in Iskra No. 72 of August 
25, 1904, under the title “Declaration of the Central Committee”.
It was adopted without the knowledge of two C.C. members,
Lenin, who was in Switzerland, and Rozalia Zemlyachka,
which deprived them of the opportunity of standing up for the
views of the Party’s majority in the C.C. The declaration
recognised the Menshevik Editorial Board of Iskra, co-opted by
Plekhanov, and co-opted another three conciliatory members of the
C.C., namely, A. I. Lyubimov, L. Y. Karpov and I. F.
Dubrovinsky. The conciliators came out against the convocation of the
Party’s Third Congress and dissolved the C.C. Southern Bureau,
which had been campaigning for the Congress. They revoked Lenin’s
powers as C.C. representative abroad and prohibited the
publication of his works without the permission of the C.C. collegium.

The adoption of the July Declaration signified a total betrayal
of the decisions of the Party’s Second Congress by the
conciliatory members of the C.C. and their open backing of the Mensheviks.

Lenin was supported by the Party’s local committees—St. 
Petersburg, Moscow, Riga, Baku, Tiflis, Imeretian-Mingrelian,
Nikolayev, Odessa and Yekaterinoslav—which resolutely
condemned the July Declaration.





[7]
A reference to the “Letter to Central Committee Agents and
Committee Members of the R.S.D.L.P. Siding with the Second Party
Congress Majority” (see present edition, Vol. 7, pp. 464–65).





[8]

V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich managed to sign a contract with a
Russian co-operative printing shop in Geneva for publishing

   

Bolshevik literature following the virtual split between Lenin and the
literary group abroad, and the conciliatory Central Committee.





[9]
A reference to the coup d’état in the Central Committee by its
three conciliatory members (V. A. Noskov, L. B. Krasin and
L. Y. Galperin) at the “July” sitting (see Note 160).

September 13, 1904

Dear Vladimir Dmitrievich,

I think you should not send any application, as we
decided
previously.[1]

Stick a leaflet on the
pamphlet,[2] printing on it
(1)
an advertisement about your publishing agency (and on the
back);
(2) Boris’s statement on its prohibition (as already
set);
(3) the letter from Boris dated Sept. 12 (this
one),[3]
without the postscript;
(4) a short additional remark,
something to this effect:

“Such is the policy of people who so magnificently
carried on a war ‘of principle’ against formalism and
bureaucracy! It would, however, be interesting to learn which
clause of the Rules prohibits Party members from
publishing Party literature?

“V. Bonch-Bruyevich”

Greetings to everybody. I shall be back on Thursday,
the day after tomorrow.

Yours,
 N. Lenin

P.S. Inform Sergei Petrovich:
(1) that on Thursday we
shall evict him from his quarters and shall be spending the
night there ourselves;
(2) that Pan wrote about Samsonov
four days ago. He should have been sent direct!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At V. A. Noskov’s suggestion, V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich intended
to apply to the Central Committee for the permission to organise
a “V. Bonch-Bruyevich and N. Lenin Publishers of
Social-Democratic Literature”.





[2]
The pamphlet Our Misunderstandings by Galyorka and
Ryadovoi.





[3]
Lenin wrote his letter to V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich on the free space
of V. A. Noskov’s letter of September 12, 1904, which he had
received through Bonch-Bruyevich (see Lenin Miscellany XV,
pp. 167–68).

September 29, 1904

Dear Comrade,

I was very pleasantly surprised by reports from Sergei
Petrovich and Martyn Nikolayevich about your political
stand at the present time. I need not tell you how painful
it has been for me, over the last twelve months, to see a
break in the good relations which had previously always
existed between us. In view of these reports, I think it
would not be worth our while to look back to the past:
we could probably resume our old relations exclusively
on the basis of our common positive tasks of the present
and the future. If I am mistaken in this, you will, of course,
correct my error; but I feel it to be my duty, after my
talk with Martyn Nikolayevich, to make a first attempt
to clarify frankly and directly how we stand.

Respectfully yours,
 N. Lenin

My address is:

Coded

Personal from Lenin to Maria Petrovna

Dear Comrade,

I was extremely glad to learn from our mutual friends
(particularly from Zver—I don’t know whether you knew
her by the same nickname) that you are alive and have
taken up a political stand in solidarity with us. We were
acquainted and saw each other so long ago (at Samara in
1892–93) that it would be difficult for us to renew our
friendship without the help of new friends. And I should very
much like to renew it. For this purpose I am sending you,
taking advantage of the address I have, a detailed letter
about our affairs, and earnestly ask you to reply personally
and as soon as you can. It is quite impossible to work
together unless there is regular correspondence, but up to
now Saratov has been in the habit of keeping a stubborn
silence for months at a time. Please see that all this is changed
now, and begin to write us yourself as circumstantially
as possible. Without detailed letters from you personally it
will be impossible to get a clear picture either of your
personal activity in the cause or of Saratov conditions in
general. Please make yourself spend 2 or 3 hours a week
on this.

I send you very best greetings and good wishes.

Lenin

To Baron from Lenin

November 4, 1904

Dear Comrade,

The many reports I have had about you oblige me to
beg you to leave your work temporarily and come here for
a month. I understand perfectly how carried away you are
by your work, and how hard it is for you to tear yourself
away from it, but, after all, we must think of deploying our
forces from the standpoint of the general plan of the
campaign. We need experienced workers, and you must find some
young people to substitute for you temporarily, and come
over here without fail to settle some common problems, to
tell us about all your conclusions from your journeys, and
to confer about the new steps we are taking. This is quite
necessary, otherwise we shall be left without reserves in
any serious contingency in the future. Please reply to me
personally as soon as possible, and I entreat you not to
postpone your journey even for as long as a week. You’ve
been intending to come for a long time, but keep putting
it off. It may end badly: I’ve seen it happen before. My
best wishes, and hope to see you soon.

Yours,
 N. Lenin

Dear Friend,

Your help was extremely valuable to us in general and
to me in particular. If I have not yet made any special
request of you, it was because there has been no extremity,
but I have been confident of the utmost possible support
on your part. At the present time, a moment of extremity
is approaching, a situation so serious that I could not even
imagine anything of the kind before. Our undertaking is
threatened with complete collapse, unless we manage to
hold out for at least six months with the help of
extraordinary resources. And to do that without folding up our
activities we need a minimum of two thousand rubles a month:
for editing, publishing, transport, and equipment of the
most essential agents. That is why I now address this most
urgent request to you to help us out and procure this
support for us. Please let me know as soon as possible whether
you are able to fulfil this request of ours.

March 9, 1905

Dear Friend,

I am unable to answer most of your questions, because
I myself know no more than you do. It looks as if Voinov
is not in favour of a single centre. The Russians are. Whether
or not it will go through, I don’t know. I am more in
favour of the old
system,[3] but do not attach any particular
importance to it. The crux of the problem is consultations
between the Central Committee and the editorial board—
and that in effect brings us back again to some sort of
Council.

“Then we shall see.”

I can’t write about you to Moscow, because I have no
personal friends there, and one has to be careful with such
things. It is better to wait and see how they decide
themselves.

I will send you the outline of my report (“The Tasks
of the Third Congress”) if I find
it[1]

:

it is very brief, almost
what was said in “From the Editors”, in
Vperyod.[4]

I have not so far been able to find out what sort of
consent there was on the part of the Central Committee to a
congress. I myself was very much afraid of a skilful C.C.
intrigue—you saw our attitude in
Vperyod.[5] Now the
Minority C.C. have nearly all been arrested, only Fisher,

    

Nikitich and Karp remain. Stein and
Povar[6] have also
been arrested. This will probably weaken the Mensheviks
for a long time. Over here, dear old Martov has a real fit
at his club at any mention of the congress. Judging by
this, they won’t come. But who can know for certain? I am
ready even for the worst: for a split on our part, but
consider this improbable.

Don’t tell me you have not even managed to get a 
minute of Deutsch’s most disgusting boasts. Why, that is
unheard of! One couldn’t even expect such impudence.
You should have forced him up against the minutes, published
a list of “their” groups or at least passed the minutes on
for the congress, so as to show the Russians the boundless
impudence of these gentlemen.

All the best,
 N. Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
I have found it. I can’t send it, because it is hieroglyphics on a
scrap of paper. My advice is to concentrate on the experience of the
Second Congress.—Lenin
 



[2]
The addressee has not been ascertained.





[3]
The notification issued by the Bureau of Majority Committees
on the convocation of the Party’s Third Congress contained a
clause, in the section dealing with organisational questions for
decision at the Congress, on re-organising the centres. It said:
“There is to be only one centre, and that in Russia” =

(see KPSS v
resolyutsiyakh i resheniyakh syezdov, konferentsy i plenumov TsK
[The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses,
Conferences and C.C. Plenary Meetings], Part One, 1954, p. 72). Lenin
expressed his attitude to this clause in the document “
Modification of the Clause in the Rules Concerning the Centres” (see present
edition, Vol. 8, pp. 197–99), proposing the retention of two
centres, one abroad, the C.O. Editorial Board, and one in Russia,
the Central Committee, whose periodical meetings “actually will
always play the role of supreme or highest ‘Council’ of the Party”
 (ibid., p. 199).





[4]

“From the Editors” was written by Lenin and published in Vperyod
(Forward) No. 8 on February 28 (15), 1905. In the present edition,
it is entitled “The Convening of the Third Party Congress” (see
Vol. 8, pp. 177–80).





[5]
Vperyod No. 8, of February 28 (15), 1905, carried the following
statement in the “From the Party” section, drawn up by M. S.
Olminsky:

__NOTE_170_COMMENT: Seems to be missing opening “ (close ” on next
page).
First instance of missing opening “.

From the Editors: We have just received information
that can be interpreted as the C.C.’s consent to a congress right
away. Without in any way vouching for its authenticity for the
lime being, we do consider it plausible. The C.C. has been
opposing a congress for many months, dissolving organisations and
boycotting and disorganising committees favouring a congress.


These tactics have failed. Now, being guided by its rule of ‘
expediency is all, formality, nothing’, the C.C. is prepared, for the
sake of ‘expediency’ (that is, prevention of a congress), to declare
formally a hundred times, if need be, that it wants a congress
convened at once.”

Lenin added the following: “We hope that neither the Bureau
nor the local committees will let themselves be duped by the
trickery of the Party ‘Shidlovsky Commission’.

__NOTE_NOTE_170__ A second instance where ” appears to be missing
from end of quotations.

The same attitude
to the C.C.’s consent was expressed by Lenin in his letter to
S. I. Gusev on February 25, 1905 (see present edition, Vol. 34,
p. 298).





[6]
A reference to the arrest of C.C. members in the home of the writer
Leonid Andreyev in Moscow on February 9 (22), 1905.

Dear Sir,

Thank you very much for your donation. I have received
a cheque for £80 (francs 2,008) and directed £60 (frs 1,506)
according to your prescriptions in St. Petersburg to our
St. Petersburg Committee of the Russian Social-Democratic
Labour Party. I have received also the second cheque for
£90 (the sum not yet received here in francs). £50 will be
also sent to aid the widows and orphans of the St. 
Petersburg (labourers) working men, killed on 9 (22) January.
With kind regards.

Yours very sincerely,

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s letter to the secretary of the Labour Representation
Committee in Britain was written in the following circumstances.
In 1904, in connection with the strikes in Russia, Russian
Social-Democratic organisations in London set up a committee in aid of
the Russian strikers, which sent out an appeal for aid to British
trade unions. It was also decided to appeal to the Labour
Representation Committee, of which James Ramsay MacDonald was secretary.
The negotiations with the Committee were assigned to K. M.
Takhtarev and N. A. Alexeyev (who were members of the Russian
Social-Democratic organisation in London before its split). The Labour
Representation Committee responded to the appeal, stipulating
that a part of the money should go in aid of the widows and
orphans of the numerous victims of the fusillade of January 9 (22),
1905.

April 5, 1905

Dear Friend,

So far I can say nothing definite about the
date.[1] I
think you will have time enough to go to Liège, if you
can return on Sunday, or if you don’t take a return ticket
and don’t go back to Paris (probably the best thing will
be to take a 45–day circular ticket, Paris—Liege, etc.—
Paris, right away). It’s hardly possible before Monday,
although, I repeat, I’m not sure. Today, April 5, was fixed
as the latest date for departure from St. Petersburg—ergo
it is hardly likely before Monday. So far no one has arrived.
On Friday, two will be setting off from here—they may
call at your town, but strictly incognito.

Have you seen Plekhanov’s
Dnevnik[2]? What a
melancholy tone of utter resignation! I am sorry for the old man,
he’s angry for no good reason, but what a lovely brain....

Our line with the delegates must be strictly peaceable:
we “have nothing to lose, but stand to win everything (if
there’s a victory)”; for our opponents it’s the other way
round. You will, of course, see this yourself from the B.M.C.
and C.C.
leaflet,[3] and also from No. 13 (Question of
Organisation).[4]

Hurry, hurry, hurry with the report of the Committee of
the Organisation
Abroad,[5] the list of members and all the
documents.

Au revoir,
 Yours,
 N. Lenin

Greetings to Kiska! How is she getting on?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the opening of the Third Party Congress. Lenin
wrote to P. A. Krasikov on Wednesday, April 5, expecting it, to
open not earlier than Monday (April 10). However, the Congress
opened only on April 25. C.C. members who were on the
Organising Committee for the convocation of the Congress made a final
effort to reach agreement with the Party Council (Plekhanov,
Axelrod and Martov), to have them recognise the C.C. decision
on the convocation of the Congress and approve the work done
by the O.C. The talks dragged out until the arrival of the
delegates from Russia in Geneva and the departure of the Bolsheviks
for London.

Dnevnik Sotsial-Demokrata (Diary of a Social-Democrat)—a
non-periodical published at long intervals by G. V. Plekhanov in
Geneva from March 1905 to April 1912. There were 16 issues in all.
Its publication was resumed in Petrograd in 1916, but only one
issue appeared.

A reference to the joint appeal to the Party on behalf of the C.C.
and the Bureau of Majority Committees (B.M.C.) of March 12,
1905, setting the task of the Congress: to work out general Party
tactics and establish organisational unity. The appeal listed the

   

authorised committees and said that the C.C. and the B.M.C.
were setting up an Organising Committee for the convocation
of the Congress. The appeal appeared in Vperyod No. 13, on April 
5 (March 23), 1905.





[4]
The newspaper Vperyod No. 13 carried a draft report of the Bureau
of Majority Committees to the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
under the title “Question of Organisation ” containing draft changes
in the Party’s Rules (prepared by “Ivanov”—A. A.
Bogdanov).





[5]
A reference to a report prepared by P. A. Krasikov, who was
nominated a delegate to the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
from the Committee of the Organisation Abroad. The Committee
headed Bolshevik groups abroad which had broken with the
League Abroad, when it fell under Menshevik control after its
Second Congress.

I hasten to remind you about one thing which it is 
essential to translate and publish as soon as possible, and
which I forgot to mention in my talk with you (although
I have had this thing in mind for a very long time!). It
is Friedrich Engels’s Die Reichsverfassungskampagne, from
the collection of the works of Marx and Engels published
by Mehring (Marx, Nachlass, etc., Vol. III). This is quite
a separate thing, which really must appear as a pamphlet.
It is now of particularly great
interest.[2]
 

Notes

The addressee has not been ascertained.





[2]
Lenin examines in detail Engels’s Die deutsche
Reichsverfassungskampagne (The German Campaign for an Imperial Constitution)
in his report at the Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. on May 
1, 1905, dealing with the participation of Social-Democrats in
the provisional revolutionary government (see present edition,
Vol. 8, pp. 393–95). This work of Engels is an essay on the history
of the Baden-Pfalz uprising of 1849, in which he personally took
part as an A.D.C. of Willich.

In the spring and summer of 1905, some legal publishing houses
set up in Russia undertook the publication of the works of Marx
and Engels in Russian translations. Lenin edited Marx’s The
Civil War in France and other works for Burevestnik
Publishers in Odessa. Engels’s pamphlet was not published in Russian
before the October Revolution.

Dear Sir,

I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of £25, of which
£5 will be subscribed, according Your condition, for relief
work. Your subscriptions are all mentioned in our paper
Vperiod (Forward), which we send to You. Now I send
You again the issues of this paper, where the subscriptions
are mentioned and I notice these mentions with blue pencil.

We have written already to St. Petersburg Committee of
the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party that it is
necessary to make a report before some working men meetings
about the subscriptions from the L.R.C. All
communications with the organisations of our party being secret it
must take some time before an answer can be received. This
week some Russian comrades go to St. Petersburg and
I repeated to them my request. They promised to me to
take all measures to accelerate this report in St. Petersburg
and to send a notice to You. Your letter from 22.4.05 will
also be sent to the St. Petersburg Committee.

I hope, dear Sir, that you will soon receive a letter from
our Petersburg comrades stating the report before working
men meeting in the Russian capital.

I beg to apologise for my bad English.

With kindest thanks.

Yours very sincerely,
 Vl. Oulianoff
 (Editor of Vperiod)

My dear Kiska,

I have just sent you a telegram. To be on the safe side,
I will explain what it is about. I have been summoned
to Paris on business. I want on no account to waste my time
in travelling merely for this reason, but to give a lecture.
The subject: “The Third Congress and Its Decisions”. The
contents: a parallel analysis of our decisions and those
of the Mensheviks. They have just issued an announcement
about their conference, and I will analyse it. I can speak
only on Tuesday (I will be arriving on Monday, but my
evening will be taken up) and must finish in one day. If
you can, hire the biggest hall (where I spoke against Strove—
Filatov and the others will know) and inform the
maximum number of people. If you have not yet telegraphed a
clear reply, do so tomorrow, so that I should know exactly
whether a hall has been hired. Perhaps you will even have
time to write to me by express (so that I should get it not
later than Sunday morning), but if you have something
important to report, be sure to cable.

I am giving the same lecture here today.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Tournez s’il vous
plaît![1]


If by any chance it turned out that I couldn’t deliver
the lecture, I might not come at all. Therefore be sure to
reply.[2]

September 15, 1905

Dear Comrades,

I have received the money, 1,000 rubles—2,640 francs—
and the first issue of Rabochy. It makes an excellent
impression. Let us hope that it will largely solve the difficult
problem of providing a popular exposition which is not
boring. There is something fresh in the tone and character
of the exposition. A splendid fighting spirit. In short, let
me congratulate you on this success with all my heart, and
wish for more. So far, I have the following minor remarks:
(1) a little more should be said about socialism, in view
of the “explanatory” nature of the organ, and
(2) the
fighting political slogans should be more closely and directly
tied in with the resolutions of the Third Congress, and with
the general spirit of our revolutionary Social-Democratic
tactics.

Now for your letter of Aug. 24,
1905,[2] which simply
amazed us all by its tone.
I. About information. You “can
do nothing more”. That is not true, since we find that
the Bund, and the Mensheviks, and a number of Bolsheviks
can do more, and are doing it. It is a fact that the C.C.
member abroad is not as well informed as the Bundists and
Iskra. This should be put right, and maintained steadily
through tireless effort. Here is the most recent example.
We received your active boycott resolution just the other
day.[3] People arriving from Russia have known about it
since June! And you tell us that you “can do nothing more”?
Its late arrival caused discordance between us, through
no fault of mine, for, not knowing how you were

    

interpreting it, I gave a different interpretation of “active boycott”
in Proletary.

There you have another fact of the two-centre situation
which you have restored. In substance, the discordance turned
out not to be great, but still it is undesirable on a question
concerning the course of action of the whole Party. I believe
it to be
(1) extremely important and the only correct
approach, from the point of view of the decisions of the Third
Congress, to put forward directly, as the central point
in the agitation campaign, the slogan of insurrection and
a provisional revolutionary government.
(2) I think it is
quite wrong to advise that meetings of the electors should
be “dispersed by force”. Such tactics would be fatal. One
of the two things: either there are no conditions for using
force on a sizable scale—in which case, we should confine
ourselves to agitation, speeches, strikes and
demonstrations, making an effort at persuading the electors and on no
account “dispersing them”. Or conditions do exist for the
use of force on any considerable scale—in which case the
force must be directed, not against the electors, but against
the police and the government. In that case, undertake an
insurrection. Otherwise you risk landing in a most absurd
situation: the workers “use force to break up” meetings
of electors; the government uses force to defend them!
This in practice shows the harmfulness of not advancing
the straightforward and resolute slogan of insurrection, as
a centre of agitation against the Duma: prepare for an
insurrection, try to persuade everybody (including the electors
as well) to prepare for an insurrection, explain its
objectives, forms, methods, conditions, organs and preliminaries.
But don’t use force to no purpose, before it has been
accumulated, for if you haven’t convinced the electors, it is
plain madness and suicide for the Social-Democrats to
scatter them by force.

Furthermore.
II. You write that you were not tricking
the Organising Committee, but were doing the will of the
Third Congress. I think that you are clearly wrong in this.
I wrote to you as long ago
as...[1]

about the need to prepare
    

the conditions for unification, and two congresses to give it
effect (in the same place and at the same time, with an
obligation on the part of each organisation to accept the
decisions of its own congress). So there is no difference of opinion
there. But it is a fact that you have forgotten about the
secret resolution (I append it below) concerning the 
obligatory endorsement of the conditions of fusion by the
Fourth Congress. That is what I have been insisting on. Two
clauses of the Organising Committee’s statement—Clauses
2 and 3—(Letuchy Listok
TsK[4] No. 3, p. 5) speak out
directly against unification through a congress. This cannot
be denied. But you, in your reply, say nothing at all of
your disagreement! So the result is that you have set aside
the resolution. That this is a mistake, and that it must be
corrected, is beyond doubt.

Then there is another unquestionable mistake: the
absence of any direct reply to the Organising Committee.
You write that “it was a question of fusion on the basis of
the Third Congress”. Have a heart, gentlemen! Why deceive
yourselves? Why weaken your correct position by obvious
hypocrisy?

Fusion on the basis of the Third Congress was rejected.
It was offered here both by Vinter and by Vadim directly
both to Plekhanov and to the Organising Committee. Given
such a unification, there would have been a single C.O.
(through his agents, Plekhanov even suggested a “trio”
for it). Given such a unification, there would have been a
single C.C., formed out of both halves as an essential
condition, i.e., the “co-optation” would not have been co-optation
but a real fusion.

But this was rejected. Consequently, there remains 
agreement up to the Fourth Congress, and fusion “on the
basis of the Fourth Congress”. Instead of giving such a direct
and clear reply and statement for all to hear, you evade
the substance of the question by withholding your opinion
from our people (for while the O.C. is patently proposing
fusion not on the basis of the Third Congress, you reply:
this is on the whole acceptable, good, let’s have another

    

talk about it!). Meanwhile you write to me: “Our ultimatum
was the Rules of the Third Congress.” And you don’t call
that self-deception? Why, if you say it in public, in the
first place, all the Bolsheviks will laugh you out of court,
and, in the second place, the Mensheviks will reply to
you in such fashion that all your good intentions about
fusion will go to the devil!

In my opinion, it is better to tell the Party frankly:
to our regret, they have rejected unification on the basis
of the Third Congress. Let’s set about preparing for the
Fourth Congress in such a way as to have two congresses
assemble at the same time and in the same place. Let’s
work out a plan of unification. Let’s say, in all parallel
organisations everywhere there are equal numbers of both
groups (à la
Nikolayev[5]). If so, draw up a list of parallel
organisations, a complete list, and poll all of them. Then
there is a Central Committee, shall we say, also half–and–
half, i.e., in equal numbers. With complete unification,
there can be no objection in principle to “co-optation” of
that kind (though in practice the question is more
complicated and one must know how many parallel organisations
there are, etc). (In parenthesis: it’s a great pity that in No. 1
of Letuchy Listok you boasted that 2/3 of the Party are on
our side. Thereby you prejudiced any future acceptance
of the “half-and-half” principle on your part. And were
you really telling the truth about the 2/3?) Furthermore,
the C.O. With fusion it would be absurd, in my opinion,
to have two Central Organs and I believe it possible that
the Bolsheviks will prefer, rather than have this absurd
situation, to have their own organ issued by several
committees, in accordance with the Party Rules. If there are two
rival Central Organs, unification will be a dead letter. In
that event, it is better to have “agreement”, on a basis
similar to that at Nikolayev, i.e., everywhere unification
or conciliation commissions, with equal numbers from both
sides.

III. About money. We were all thunderstruck by your
statement that the C.O. must be published “on resources
from abroad”, and that the bankruptcy of the C.C. must
begin with the C.O. You write that this is not irritation and
not a rebuke. Give me leave not to believe you. To say this

    

calmly, coolly and in all seriousness is to proclaim a 
rupture between the C.O. and the Party, and this is something
you could not wish. It is something unheard of to have the
Party’s C.O. published not with the Party’s resources, but
on funds abroad, and to decide that the bankruptcy of the
Party must begin (rather than end) with the C.O. If we
were to take this seriously, instead of regarding it merely
as a sign of nervousness on account of temporary difficulties
(for in general your turnover is a “fat” one, and your
prospects both of the 60,000 arid the “undertaking” are three
times “fatter”), we should have to take immediate steps
to start publication “on resources from abroad ” of an organ
of the Committee of the Organisation Abroad. But, I
repeat, I regard this monstrous outburst on your part only
as a state of nerves, and will await our personal meeting,
since, in my opinion, it is not the beginning of a break,
but a misunderstanding.

Best wishes,
 N. Lenin

A space was left in the MS. after “as long ago as” for the date of
the letter to the Central Committee—July 28 (see present edition, Vol. 
34, pp. 320–22). N. K. Krupskaya crossed out “as long ago as” and
wrote “earlier” over it.—Ed.

The Central Committee’s letter of August 24 (September 6), 1905,
was signed by three members of the C.C. (A. A. Bogdanov, D. S.
Postolovsky and L. B. Krasin). It was in reply to Lenin’s Letter of
August 1 (14), 1905 (see present edition, Vol. 34, pp. 326–27).





[3]
The Central Committee resolution, entitled “The Central
Committee on the Duma”, was published in Proletary (The
Proletarian) No. 19, October 3 (September 20), 1905.





[4]
Letuchy Listok TsK RSDRP (Leaflet of the Central Committee of
the R.S.D.L.P.) was issued at various intervals and dealt with
current tactical and organisational questions in the light of the
decisions of the Party’s Third Congress. There were four issues
in all.





[5]
A reference to the agreement between the Bolsheviks and the
Mensheviks in Nikolayev on joint political action. Both
committees appointed representatives to a commission, called “United
Organisation of Social-Democrats of the Town of Nikolayev”,
with the task of working out a plan for joint action and agitation
connected with it. To ensure the preparations for the action, the
commission set up a technical group, a funds commission, and
a combat group.

A report from Nikolayev on this agreement was published in
the “From the Party” section of Proletary No. 9 of July 26 (13),
1905.

October 4, 1905

Dear Mikhail Andreyevich,

I am very grateful to you for your letter, which gives
me even more information than Felix Alexandrovich did
in his report of a talk with you, as to the plans and tactics
of our so-called
Cadets.[1] It was extremely valuable to
have your communication that the liberals, Witte, etc.,
are in deadly fear of an active boycott. I have just received
news from Russia that an inter-Party conference of
Social-Democrats (both sections of the R.S.D.L.P., the Bund,
probably the Letts,
etc.)[2] has been held. The active
boycott tactics have been finally adopted.

Your plan is not clear to me:
(1) Do you really think there
is the slightest hope that the Cadets will refuse to
participate in an election to the Duma? I think there is none.
(2)
Don’t you think it better for us, if we are to conclude an
agreement with the radicals, to demand a million or so
from them for the purpose of arming the Petersburg
workers, than to have an election to a Constituent Assembly
right now? What point will there be in holding an election
before or without a fight against Trepov?

Of course, this needs to be discussed in greater detail.
I pin my hopes, first, on the meeting you will be having
in Berlin over the next few days with one of my
friends,[3]
and, second, on our meeting here with you about which
Felix wrote to us. Wishing you success in the struggle for
an active boycott.

Yours faithfully....
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Cadets—Constitutional-Democratic Party, the leading party of
the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia, which was founded
in 1905. They advocated a constitutional monarchy. During the
first Russian revolution of 1905–07, they styled themselves the
party of “people’s freedom”, while actually betraying the people’s
interests and holding secret talks with the tsarist government
on how to crush the revolution. As the Opposition Party in the
Duma, they strove to share power with the tsarist government and
supported it on all major issues of domestic and foreign policy.

During the First World War, Cadet leaders, among them
Milyukov, were the chief proponents of the annexationist policy
of Russian imperialism. After the February revolution of 1917,
they entered the bourgeois Provisional Government and fought the
revolutionary movement of workers and peasants; they stood
up for the landed estates and wanted to force the people to
continue the imperialist war. After the victory of the October
Socialist Revolution, the Cadets took part in the counter-revolutionary
armed struggle against Soviet Russia.





[2]
The conference of Social-Democratic organisations in Russia to
which Lenin refers was held in Riga on September 7–9 (20–22),
1905. It was called by the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. to work out the
tactics in respect of the Duma. It was attended by representatives
of the C.C., the O.C. of the Mensheviks, the Bund, the Lettish
Social-Democrats, the Social-Democrats of Poland and
Lithuania, and the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party. Over Menshevik
protests, the conference passed a resolution on active boycott
of the Bulygin Duma. The conference decisions were published in
Proletary No. 22 on October 24(11), 1905 (see KPSS v
resolyutsiyakh..., Part One, 1954, pp. 91–94). They are assessed in Lenin’s
articles “The First Results of the Political Alignment” and “The
Hysterics of the Defeated” (see present edition, Vol. 9, pp. 396–
404 and 405–07).

October 25, 1905

Dear Friends,

I have just received your letter about my appointment
to the International
Bureau[1] (it is a pity that you did not
appoint Orlovsky, but we can discuss that when we meet)
and about a meeting at Odessa (Berlin). It is essential to
have a meeting as soon as possible. Instead of Odessa, I
can suggest Warsaw
(Königsberg)[2]—all the conditions are
the same, but it’s nearer and more unexpected for the
police. In the latter place all could be ready for you in four
days, given the best possible conditions (a legal passport),
on which I advise you to begin working energetically at
once. Given worse conditions, the period is still very short,
and it would be a good thing, if possible, to increase the
number of participants. If you decide on an unfamiliar
city (Königsberg is 22 hours from St. Petersburg) the
meeting could be appointed in a cafe, hotel, or tavern, with the
aid of a guide-book.

I am writing this very day to the I. Bureau for
information about the conference and its date; directly I receive
the reply, I will forward it to you. Please hurry with our
meeting, regardless even of the conference with the I. 
Bureau.

Were minutes taken at the inter-Party conference? If they
were, send them to us without fail.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
International Socialist Bureau—the executive organ of the Second
International, was established by decision of the Paris Congress

   

of 1900. Lenin was a member of the Bureau from 1905 to 1912 as
a representative of the R.S.D.L.P.





[2]
For reasons of secrecy Berlin was called Odessa, and Königsberg—
Warsaw.

Further on, the reference is to the general meeting of C.C. and
C.O. members with Lenin, which is also mentioned in his letter
of October 5, 1905 (see present edition, Vol. 34, pp. 348–49).

Dear Comrade,

According to our agreement, the material for Vol. II
should have been delivered by Oct. 1, and for Vol. III,
by
Oct. 10.[1] The first volume has been delayed. I have
already handed in 12 sheets for Volume II, another 7 are
ready, and I can hand in the remainder (about 5 or 7) very
soon. But I should like to know whether you really require
all this material so quickly. Will you be setting it at once?
Have you already sent the 12 sheets of Volume II for
setting? Will publication be delayed if I send you the end of
Volume II later? If it will, I can let you have the end of
Volume II immediately, if you want it. But I have a plan
to write, for the end of Volume II, a large work about the
distribution of land in Russia (using the new statistical
data of 1905) and about municipalisation (taking into
account Volume IV of Capital, or Theorien über den
Mehrwert, which also appeared in 1905). I think it would be of
great interest for the public, and would be very timely. I
have already collected nearly all the material for the work
and processed part of it. I need a few weeks to finish it;
I hope to be able to write the work in a few weeks.

Please, let me know, therefore, whether you want Vol. II
to be delivered immediately without this new article, or
to have it handed in with the new article in about a month
or six weeks.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In 1907, M. S. Kedrov’s Zerno Book Publishers in St. 
Petersburg started publication of a three-volume collection of
Lenin’s works under the title “Twelve Years”. However, they
managed to issue only the first volume and a part of the second,
because of intensified harassment and strict censorship under
Stolypin.

January 7, 1908

Dear Pyotr,

Nadezhda Konstantinovna and I arrived at Geneva
today.[2] We haven’t decided finally where to stay:
Alexander Alexandrovich is very much against Geneva, and we
are reconnoitring in other places.

But we have to find out just what the situation here is
as well. Please write immediately
(1) whether you know
of a suitable person to manage the printing press and the
forwarding
section[3];
(2) what you think of the
doc [tor][1]

as such;
(3) what particularly should be borne in mind about
the printing press; [does it need ] an owner in view of the
fact that it [belongs] to the C.O. of the Bolshevik [group]
of the Stockholm Congress? Why do you consider only the
Menshevik printing press to be the property of the C.C.?
(4) Do you think that a weekly paper is possible, and what
approximate sale could it count on? 300–500–1,000?

We received your letter in Berlin amidst the panic caused
by the arrest of the
17,[4] and therefore destroyed it without
a sufficiently attentive reading.

Reply to the address....

How is your health? When [app]roximately will [you ]
be able to come back here? Has your health [at all ]
improved during this period?

All the best....
 

Notes

[2]
After his return from the Party’s London Congress, Lenin lived
in Finland, near St. Petersburg. In view of the arrests that had
started, the Bolshevik Centre decided to transfer the publication
of Proletary from Finland to some foreign country. Accordingly,
Lenin, together with A. A. Bogdanov and I. F. Dubrovinsky,
was instructed to go to Switzerland. Lenin left Finland in
December 1907, spent a few days in Stockholm waiting for N. K.
Krupskaya, stayed three days in Berlin and arrived at Geneva on
January 7, 1908.

A reference to the Proletary printing-shop and its forwarding
section.





[4]
The arrests in Berlin were connected with the changing of money
expropriated in Tiflis on June 13, 1907. The organiser of the
expropriation, Kamo (Ter-Petrosyan), and all its participants
managed to escape. But the tsarist government informed the police
abroad of the serial numbers of the 500–ruble banknotes seized
in the expropriation; in December 1907, persons changing these
banknotes were simultaneously arrested in Berlin, Munich, Paris,
Copenhagen, Stockholm and Geneva. In November 1907, Kamo
was betrayed by the provocateur Y. A. Zhitomirsky and arrested
in Berlin. The Russian Government, having established Kamo’s
identity, secured his extradition as a criminal. During the search
for the Tiflis expropriators, arrests were carried out in the
Russian Social-Democratic colonies in Paris, Munich, Geneva and
Stockholm.

Dear Pyotr,

I have the following request. I have written a big work
on the subject of the agrarian programme, in which, among
other things, I deal in detail with the debate in the
Second
Duma.[1] I lack some of the documents introduced in the
Second Duma.

More precisely: Muskenko introduced a draft of the 104
or 105, not the “well-known”
Trudovik[2] draft of the First
Duma, which was repeated in the Second as well, but the
new, S.R.
draft.[3] It was reprinted in French in Rapport
du parti S.R. au congrès de Stuttgart. Do you happen to
have the Russian text? Can you get it? I will be very much
obliged if you can help.

Has it appeared in a separate edition? Where and when?

Yours,
 V. Ulyanov

During the First World War most of the Trudoviks took a

February 3, 1908

Well, that’s what I call a “good” turn! Giving the
address and connections to the Menshevik Mandelberg. That
was really naïve. On no account let Mandelberg come
anywhere near us; but now that you have committed this piece
of stupidity, get the address back from him and cheat him.

We wrote to you yesterday about Proletary. There is a
tremendous and inevitable sharpening of the factional
struggle everywhere. Details when we meet.

Dear A. M.,

It’s a long time since I wrote to you. Our trip is being
constantly put off: the main obstacle at present is the lack
of news from Brussels. My friends wrote to me from there
that I am expected at a meeting of the Bureau (International
Socialist). I asked the secretary when I should come
(because, I said, I had to go to Italy). There’s still no reply.
But I mustn’t miss Brussels.

Have you received Proletary? What are your intentions
about it, then? And what about An. Vas.? It was with
regret that I got his refusal to write about the Commune.
Innokenty is our third editor.

Drop me a line about what plans you and An. Vas. have
for Proletary.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Maria Fyodorovna,

I enclose a letter from our librarian to A. M.

The thing is this. I want very much A. M. to write a legal
open letter to the Russian papers, asking assistance for
the Kuklin Library in Geneva by the dispatch to it of
newspapers of the period of the revolution and material on its
history.

A very short letter explaining to the general public why
assistance to the library is also important for the work
both of Gorky himself and of many other literary men he
knows.[1]

I would ask you to arrange to have the letter
hectographed (I hope Zinovy Alexeyevich will not refuse to help
in this) and sent to all Russian newspapers and journals of
a more or less decent trend.

Please organise all this!

I would ask Zinovy Alexeyevich to send me by slow
delivery the books which Victor did not take, unless Natalia
Bogdanovna takes them.

All good wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin

May Day greetings!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Russian Proletarian Library, collected by the Social–
Democrat G. A. Kuklin, who joined the Bolsheviks in 1905, and a book
storehouse and a printing press were conveyed by him into the
full possession of the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. in
July 1905, as he said in his “Statement” which appeared in 
Proletary No. 7 on July 10 (June 27), 1905.

In response to Lenin’s request, Gorky sent a letter to the editors
of Russian magazines and newspapers calling for collections of
material on the history of the 1905–07 revolution, files of various
local publications, in particular, dailies, etc. Gorky’s letter was
published in a number of magazines and newspapers in
September 1908.

July 8, 1908

Dear Comrade,

As regards the creditor, I have decided to postpone the
letter until a plenary meeting of the Central Committee,
which is to take place in the very near
future.[1] I find
it inconvenient to butt in with the meeting of the
authorised Party collegium about to take place.

I shall be very glad to see you here. I can say little that
is definite about the neighbourhood of Geneva: I have
been ill all the time since my return from London, and
am sitting at home, without seeing anyone who lives in the
country. I know that in France, but quite close to Geneva,
there are many good and hardly expensive places. For
example, there is Mornex on the slopes of the Salève, which
means that it is fairly high up. A friend of mine lived there
in 1904, and I believe one can stay there on one’s own quite
cheaply, and at slightly higher cost at the pensions, but
for 4–4 1/2 francs for sure, because that is the usual price.
One can also find a place a little farther away from Geneva
(Mornex is about 7 versts away, I should think, and there
is an electric tram up to Salève)—within 10 versts and
more, on the slopes of the Jura, but I don’t know what the
place is like over there. I will try and find out something
more definite, and will write to you directly I discover
anything.

Every good wish,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Notes
 
 



[1]
During the Fifth (London) Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. (April
30–May 19 [May 13–June 1 ], 1907), in view of the Party’s financial
difficulties, a loan was obtained, with Gorky’s help, from an
Englishman, with an obligation of repayment by January 1,
1908. It was repaid by the Bolshevik Party in 1922.

C.C. Meeting—a Plenary Meeting of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P.,
held in Geneva on August 11–13 (24–26), 1908. With regard to the
London debt, the Plenary Meeting decided to form a commission,
consisting of Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Bundists, instructing
it to write to the Englishman and tell him of the difficulties in
repaying the debt (see KPSS v resolyutsiyakh..., Part One, 1954,
p. 188).

Dear A. A.,

Here is Steklov’s letter. Reply to him yourself. I

P.S. Return the letter.

In October 1908, Y. M. Steklov asked Lenin to write an article
“Chernyshevsky and the Peasant Question” for a collection on
Chernyshevsky’s life and work. He asked Lenin to inform
Bogdanov of his letter. Lenin sent Bogdanov Steklov’s letter with his
own note.

The collection was not published.

The last two-thirds of Kamenev’s article are quite bad,
and can hardly be edited. I straightened out the first third
(p. 1 to end of p. 5) but am not able to make any further
alteration, because I see that what it needs is not editing
but complete rewriting.

In this part of the article, Kamenev gives an incredibly
woolly and confused expression, with thousands of frills,
to his idea (that the
Octobrists[1] and the Rightists are
fighting over minor matters, that their struggles,
dissensions, fights are inevitable in bourgeoisifying the monarchy
and that from this fighting the revolution follows only 
indirectly, i.e., provided the proletariat enters the arena,
and not directly, not by the bourgeoisie itself “going left”).

To my mind, we cannot publish it in this form.

Either persuade the author to rewrite the last two-thirds—
and we shall then “edit” the article, or have a hand
yourself at rewriting the last two-thirds almost completely.

I enclose (pp. 1–3 in ink) an approximate plan for its
rewriting.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Octobrists—a counter-revolutionary party of big industrialists and
landowners formed soon after the tsar’s Manifesto of October 17,
1905 (whence their name). In it, the tsar, terrified by the
revolution, promised “civil liberties” and a constitution. The
Octobrists fully supported the government’s domestic and foreign
policies.

Tuesday

Dear Grigory,

I have received the article about the Swedish
strike.[1]
It’s a very good one. I have sent it to Paris together with
the end of my article on
Bogdanov[2] (which came to 100 lines
—2 pages of Proletary in the supplement). I don’t know
now whether you will approve it all. I leave it entirely
to your judgement: I am so sick of writing this article that
now I don’t know whether it wouldn’t be better to scrap
the whole, and reply to Bogdanov literally in a couple of
words about his scandal-mongering regarding the “property
of the whole group”. It’s up to you!

I shall write about Plekhanov. The Swedish strike article
should go in as the leader.

Best wishes,
 Lenin
 

Notes

On August 4, 1909, a general strike broke out in Sweden in
response to the lockout of 83,000 workers in various industries

announced by the federation of industrialists on August 2. The

Dear Comrade,

Thank you for sending me Rosa Luxemburg’s
articles.[4]
I must protest in the strongest possible terms on the
main question—regarding the replacement of Warski by
Leder.[5] Why, you put us in the most impossible situation!
I will not say anything of Leder’s personal qualities (as
they caught the eye in work together at congresses and
conferences: these impressions of him did not at all testify
to any knowledge, capacities, literary taste, understanding
of the business, and often bore witness to petty faultfinding,
etc., etc.—you will appreciate that I am writing to you,
too, 
privatissime[1]

).

I won’t enlarge on the fact that it is
not right to substitute an inexperienced and scarcely
suitable person for an experienced writer, a sensible Marxist
and an excellent comrade.

But I will speak about the position of the C.O. editorial
board and about the crisis in the Party. You surely cannot
have failed to notice the critical situation. Warski and
I write to the Central Committee about a change in the
composition of the C.O. (Dan is clearly disrupting it).
The
liquidators[6] are disrupting the C.C. And in these
circumstances, just when there is unquestionable need of

    

a man who was at the plenum, who has been tested in the
work, who is working nicely with the board, who has begun
a serious war with a serious enemy—just at that moment
he is being replaced by a new man! Where’s your fear of
God? Don’t you see it means paralysing the C.O.? After all,
the C.O. is now the only organ of leadership for the whole
Party (until the C.C. gets together again after its disruption
by the liquidators). It is terribly important to have the C.O.
in working trim—and this is surely no time “to begin all
over again”, to “initiate” a newcomer, to argue instead of
getting on with the job. Please do try to understand that,
in order to find loopholes, the Mensheviks, relying on the
plenum (and formally they have an unquestionable right
to rely on it), argue about every single word in the
resolution, its every omission, every incident at the plenum (even
the tiniest). Now, is it conceivable, in the situation, to have
a man play the part of pendulum when he was not present at
the plenum and has not worked with us in the central
bodies of the R.S.D.L.P. for years and years? Why, this is
absolutely impossible! It means blocking the whole
business—and that at a time when highly important questions
come up for decision at every meeting. Why, Leder will
be obliged to say “I don’t know” to the thousands of
arguments and the cavilling of the Mensheviks (who, as you
know very well, are devilishly skilful at making use of every
&facuteraktioneller
Dreck[2]

).

Now, I ask you, can we have such a
man at such a time?

No. No. We are not demanding anything excessive of the
P.S.D.[3]

We know their forces, and their needs, and the
conditions of work in Poland. We are not overburdening
Warski, and are not preventing him from doing Polish
literary work. But you must let us have him in the C.O.,
as we agreed during the plenum. Without Warski, we are
absolutely not in a position to “tide over” the period of
crisis, i.e., to secure a change in the composition of the C.O.
Now, when the crisis is over, when the composition of the
C.O. is altered, then ... but even then, let’s not have Leder,

    

for the love of God. In that case, let’s have Karski, if we
can’t have Warski even then. But at present Warski is
absolutely, absolutely essential.


All good wishes. Greetings to Rosa.

Yours,
 Lenin

April 30, 1910

Dear Comrade,

Thank you for letting me know about Mikhail’s
condition. I took steps at once to get a grant for him. As matters
stand, it is hopeless to try and get it through the Central
Committee’s Bureau Abroad, because there we are now in
a minority. There was an opportunity to write to Russia,
and I asked the Russian Central Committee to take a decision
on a grant for Mikhail. I hope to have a favourable reply in
two weeks’ time. In any case, it would be essential to
ensure that Mikhail should continue the treatment and stay
at Davos for the time being, until a complete cure.

All the best,
 Yours,

July 20 

Werter
Genosse,[1]


I have just learned from Warski that two of the Golos
people (who were at the plenum) are already in Russia.
The situation is critical. Since the plenum, we have lost
three
Bolsheviks.[2] We can’t afford any more. It’s all
up, unless the Poles come to our rescue. It’s all over, unless
you get a second Polish C.C. man, and send him along
with Hanecki for 2–3 weeks, in order to convoke the
collegium at all costs only to carry through the “measures” and
for co-opting
purposes.[3] It depends on you. We have done
everything possible, lost three, can’t afford any more.
Write to me as follows: Mr. Oulianoff. Rue Mon Désir.
Villa les Roses. Pornic (Loire-Inférieure). France. I shall
be there until August 23—then at
Copenhagen.[4]

Warm greetings to Rosa.

Yours,
 N. Lenin

Soon after the C.C. Plenum in January 1910, I. F. Dubrovinsky

Meshkovsky) were arrested in Russia.

A reference to the convocation of the Russian section (collegium)
of the C.C. and co-optation of new members. The latter became
necessary because of the arrest of a number of C.C. members
elected at the London Congress in 1907. The liquidators, who took a
negative attitude to the resumption of C.C. activity in Russia,
strongly opposed the meeting of the remaining C.C. members and
co-optation of new ones. Their formal refusal to take part in the effort
to restore the C.C. served as the immediate cause for the
cancellation of the agreement concluded at the C.C. Plenary Meeting
in January 1910. As a result of Lenin’s insistent demand J. J.
Marchlewski went to Russia.

September 30, 1910

Werter Genosse,

Excuse me for this delay in replying to your two letters.
I returned to Paris only the other
day,[4] and was unable
to reply earlier.

As regards an article for the C.O. on the disarmament
resolution of the Copenhagen Congress, it was ordered (back
in Copenhagen) and written by another contributor.
Unfortunately, your proposal came too late.

As to inserting your article in the next issue, I must
have a talk with Warski and another member of the editorial
board. I shall do this.

Concerning your leading articles in Leipziger
Volkszeitung, I must say that the question is very interesting, but
I have not studied it at length, and it seems to me that
theoretically you are not quite right. The criterion of what
is “impracticable within the framework of capitalism”
should not be taken in the sense that the bourgeoisie will
not allow it, that it cannot be achieved, etc. In that sense,
very many demands in our minimum programme are “
impracticable”, but are none the less obligatory.

Then, when mentioning the Inaugural Address of the
International, you omit from your quotation Marx’s words
about the principles of relations between
states.[5] Is not
that a “minimum programme” in foreign policy? And
finally, why do you say nothing about Engels’s “Kann
Europa
abrüsten?”[1]

?


 

You are quite right, in my opinion (all this is my
personal opinion, of course), that it is impossible to leave out
the demand to arm the people. Wouldn’t it be more correct
to concentrate your fire not on the fact that 
Abrüstung[2]

is written into the resolution, but that 
Volkswehr[3]

is
not?

I want to reply to Martov and Trotsky in Neue Zeit.
I have already written to Kautsky and asked him whether
they would carry it and how long it could be. It is also
necessary of course to reply in Leipziger Volkszeitung.

Best wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin

On September 28, 1910, Lenin returned to Paris from Copenhagen
where he had stayed after the Eighth International Socialist

to Stockholm to visit his mother, M. A. Ulyanova, and his sister,
M. I. Ulyanova.





[5]
Karl Radek, in quoting the Inaugural Address of the Working
Men’s International Association, omitted the words of Marx to
the effect that in the event of it being impossible to prevent the
diplomatic activity of one’s government, the working class must
“combine in simultaneous denunciation, and indicate the simple
laws of morals and justice, which ought to govern the relations
of private individuals, as the rules paramount of the intercourse of
nations” =

(see Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol. I, p. 385).

To Comrade Karl Radek

October 9, 1910

Dear Comrade,

I intended to reply to the articles by Martov and Trotsky
in a long article on the substance of the matter in Neue
Zeit, But things turned out otherwise. You published a
very good statement, while Comrade Karski, even before
I had written to Kautsky and Wurm of my intention, had
sent Neue Zeit an article against
Martov.[1] Wurm sent me
Karski’s article, and I agreed that that was enough.

But I cannot, however, leave unanswered Martov and
Trotsky’s most incredible absurdities and distortions. About
a third or a half of my article is now ready. Its subject
is: “The Historical Meaning of the Inner-Party Struggle in
Russia”.[2] Please give me your advice: is it possible and
will it be useful to publish this article in Leipziger
Volkszeitung?

If the answer depends on whether or not the editorial
board likes my article, I am of course prepared to send it
to you without laying down any conditions.

I should be very grateful to you if you could tell me
anything about this right away. For instance, I should like to
know whether you could publish a few feature articles on
the subject in Leipziger Volkszeitung. What is the maximum
length of an article to be? And one other thing: I do not
write German, but Russian. Can you have a translation made
in Leipzig—or do you find this inconvenient or difficult,
and prefer that I should find a translator over here (which of

    

course, in all probability, I can do)? Or, finally, should
I write in my very had German (of which this letter is a
specimen), and you can then have my bad German translated
into good German in Leipzig? (A friend once told me that
it was easier to translate into German from good Russian
than from bad German.)

With best wishes,
 Yours,
 N. Lenin

Dear G. V.,

Comrade Grigory has just given me your letter. I have
had only one paper from the International Socialist Bureau,
exclusively about money, i.e., about our Party’s
contribution for the maintenance of the International Socialist
Bureau. I passed it on to the treasurer of the C.C. ’s Bureau
Abroad, and replied to Huysmans that I had informed the
C.G. about the contribution. I shall, of course, send on to
you every “non-financial” paper from the International
Socialist Bureau.

What did you think of Rabochaya Gazeta?
People are saying here that Martov and Co., when
resuming the publication of Golos, invited the pro-Party
Mensheviks “to clear out” of “their” group.

Best wishes,
 Yours,
 N. Lenin

February 3, 1911

Dear Comrade,

I received your letter about Singer today, and passed
it on to a comrade who promised to send a telegram (I
myself have a touch of the flu). By the way, on December 18,
I sent you a letter from Huysmans and my draft
reply.[1]
Your reply seems to be such a long time in arriving! Send
me back Huysmans’s letter, at least.

The Duma group informs us that the liquidators made
a new attack after Jordansky’s note in No. 4 of Zvezda.
The liquidators were backed by Smirnov, Martov’s brother,
Cherevanin and others.

Veselovsky, Chernyshov, Lositsky were against.

Poletayev (who wrote to me about it) says that there is
no doubt that they have won, i.e., that the liquidators’
attack has been beaten off.

Best wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear A. M.,

How is your health? M. F. wrote that you had returned
with a cough, etc. I hope you are better.

We’ve had some bad luck with
Mysl.[1] You probably
know what has happened from Rech and other papers. We
have to transfer the whole business to St. Petersburg, and
begin all over again. But we have no legal and reliable
people.

Could you help us, if you sympathise with Mysl? Or
perhaps Pyatnitsky could help? As things are, we still
have enough money to publish such a small journal (
provided, of course, that we all work for nothing and pay
outsiders 20 rubles a sheet! Not so generous, you see). So
at present it is only technical help that is needed: to find
a publisher who, without spending a kopek of his own, would
bring out the journal (and we so strongly recognise the
strictest legality, that we give the right both to the
publisher and to the secretary of the editorial board-f-a lawyer
to hold up anything in the least dangerous; we brought out
four issues without the slightest faultfinding from the court.
No. 5 was confiscated on account of
Kautsky[2]! That was
obviously a mere pretext. There was nothing illegal in
Kautsky).

Why should not Pyatnitsky or someone else help us in
such a safe business? If it is impossible to find a publisher,
what about a secretary, a legal person whom we would pay
50 rubles a month for worrying about the printing press and
forwarding. All we want is an honest and thoughtful person.
The trouble is that we have no legal people, except
workmen (and they won’t do).
 

The second question. We have a translation of Kautsky’s
latest articles against Maslov, which has already been paid
for.[3] It’s quite legal. It’s an essential thing, because
Maslov has written a lot of nonsense and has also lied to
his Russian readers. It’s 3–5 printed sheets. Could it be
published—without author’s fees (for our translation has
already been, paid for) at cost price? Is Pyatnitsky (or
someone else) suitable for anything like this or not?

The third question. Y. M. Nakhamkis, deported here
from St. Petersburg for his connections with the
Social-Democratic Duma group (he is Nevzorov or Steklov, author
of a good book about
Chernyshevsky[4]), is badly in need
of work and asks me to inquire whether it would be possible
to publish Peary: A Journey to the North Pole. He thinks
it will have a good sale.

What news is there of the “plans”? Please write.

And do reply to the workers at our school. They are good
fellows. One of them is a poet, and keeps writing verses,
but the poor chap has no guide, helper, instructor or
adviser.

Best wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Robert E. Peary:

La découverte du pôle nord, Paris—magnificent
illustrations. The blocks can be bought here cheaply. About 15
printed sheets, each of 40,000 letters and spaces. (I have
just seen Steklov, who gave me these details.)

Our Party has undoubtedly arrived at one of the critical
points of its development. All Bolsheviks must do their
utmost to fully clarify their principles, to unite, and once
again lead the Party out on to the high road.

The events that have just taken place abroad (June and
July 1911) are a sign of crisis in the Party centres. These
events, described and commented upon in a number of
leaflets of nearly all groups and trends, amount to this, that
the liquidators (through the Central Committee Bureau
Abroad[1]—C.C.B.A.) have finally prevented the
convocation of a plenum. The Bolsheviks have broken with this
C.C.B.A., which has outlawed itself, and jointly with the
“conciliators” and the Poles have set up a Technical
Commission and an Organising
Commission[2] for the convocation
of a conference.

What are the principles involved in these events?

The break with the liquidators, who had broken with the
R.S.D.L.P., but continued to obstruct all its work from
inside the centres (like the C.C.B.A.), means the
elimination of this obstruction and the possibility of unanimously
setting about the restoration of the illegal and really
revolutionary Social-Democratic Party. That is the first and
main thing. The second is that the break with the C.C.B.A.,
which had violated all Party laws (and the consequent
resignation from the C.O. editorial board of Martov and Dan,
who since February 1910 had taken no part in the C.O.),
means putting right the mistake of the plenum (in January
1910) owing to which it was not the pro-Party Mensheviks
but the
Golosists[3] (i.e., liquidators) who turned out to be in
the central bodies. The principle laid down by the plenum

    

(cleansing the workers’ party of the bourgeois trends of
liquidationism and
otzovism[4]) has now been divested
of the liquidationist centres concealing it.

Fortunately, a court of arbitration has now assessed
the hypocritical outcries of the Golos people and Trotsky
in defence of the C.C.B.A. Three German Social-Democrats
(Mehring, Kautsky and Clara Zetkin) were to decide the
question of the Bolshevik funds conditionally handed over
to the C.C., and they decided provisionally, pending the
conference, to give the money to the Technical Commission
and not to the C.C.B.A. This decision is tantamount to
the court of arbitration’s recognition that the C.C.B.A.
was in the wrong.

What is the attitude of the other factions abroad? Trotsky,
of course, is solidly behind the liquidators, the
Vperyodists[5] also (they have not yet said as much in the press,
but it is known from their official negotiations with the
Organising Commission). Plekhanov is “on the fence”, while
preaching agreement with the C.C.B.A. (see Plekhanovites’
resolution).

The C.C.B.A. is itself trying to set about the calling
of a conference, with the help of Trotsky, Vperyod and Co.
Whether anything will come of such an “alliance”, no one
knows. A collapse of principle is there inevitable. Nothing
even resembling Party work can result from this bloc.
The “bloc” which is being organised by the former C.C.B.A.
means nothing but intrigue to cover up the anti-Party and
anti-Social-Democratic activity of the group of Messrs.
Potresov, Mikhail, Yuri, Roman and Co.

The Bolsheviks’ task now is to unite, beat off the attack
of all the enemies of Social-Democracy, give a lead to all
who are wavering, and help the illegal R.S.D.L.P. to get
on its feet.

Some say this is a split. The hypocrisy of these outcries
from the gentry in the C.C.B.A. has been recognised even
by the Germans, who are not familiar with Russian affairs.
Martov’s pamphlet in German, delivered to the holders
of the funds, caused Clara Zetkin to make this comment:
“A disgusting production.”

In Russia, there is no split among the illegal
organisations, there are no parallel Social-Democratic organisations.

    

There are Party people, and liquidators who have broken
away and set up a separate group. Groups abroad, like those
of Golos, Trotsky, the Bund, and Vperyod, want to cover
up the break-away of the liquidators, help them to hide
under the banner of the R.S.D.L.P., and help them to thwart
the rebuilding of the R.S.D.L.P. It is our task at all costs
to rebuff the liquidators and, despite their opposition,
recreate the R.S.D.L.P. To say that rebuilding and
reinforcing the illegal party, despite the opposition of the
breakaway legalists, is “a split” means to make a mockery of the
truth and (unconsciously or hypocritically) stretch out a
hand to the liquidators. There are some who say that the
Bolsheviks want a faction of their own. On this point the
“conciliators” (in Paris) have now separated into a faction
of their own. Without desiring “factionalism”, they have
set up a new faction (with representatives of its own in the
Technical Commission and the Organising Commission—and
that is the basic symptom of a faction, the “conciliators’”
internal discipline among themselves).

How does the question of factionalism stand? In January
1910 the Bolsheviks dissolved their group on condition that
all the other factions would also be dissolved. This
condition has not been carried out, as everyone knows. Golos,
Vperyod, and Trotsky and Co. have intensified their
factional activity. And on December 5, 1910, we Bolsheviks
publicly declared that the stipulation had been violated
and that our agreement on the dissolution of all factions
had been broken, and demanded a return of our group’s
funds.

Not only the anti-Party trends, but also the Plekhanovites
have remained a separate faction: they have their own organ
(Dnevnik), their own platform, their factional nominees to
the central bodies, their internal faction discipline.

In these circumstances, the shouts against “factionalism”
are so empty, especially when coming from those who have
just formed their own faction. Surely it is time to
understand that shouts against factionalism are meant to distract
attention from the really important question, that of the
Party or anti-Party content of the activity of the various
factions. We Bolsheviks set up the T.C. and the O.C. in a
bloc with the factions of the “conciliators” and the Poles.

    

The Poles are for the “conciliators”; we are in the minority,
we are not responsible for the conciliatory errors of the T.C.
and the O.C. The whole history of “conciliationism” (which
we shall recount in the press, directly the conciliators force
us to do it) is crying evidence of its erroneous nature. The
Bolsheviks must understand this, so as not to repeat these
errors.

The “conciliators” have not understood the ideological
roots of what keeps us apart from the liquidators, and have
therefore left them a number of loopholes and have
frequently been (involuntarily) a plaything in the hands of the
liquidators. At the January 1910 plenum, the “conciliators”
(together with the Poles) got through an idiotic clause
in the resolution: “For the first time”, etc. (see Lenin’s
article in Diskussionny Listok
No. 2,[6] or Plekhanov’s
Dnevnik, which admitted that the clause was blown up,
integralist, i.e., nonsensical). The conciliators put their
trust in the Golos people; in return, Golos publicly disgraced
the conciliators with its greasy kisses.

The conciliators put their trust in Trotsky, who has
clearly executed a full turn towards the liquidators. The
conciliators in Russia (having had control of the C.C.
Bureau, i.e., all the authority and all the money, for more
than a year) haggled with the liquidators, invited them,
“awaited” them and, for that reason, have done nothing.

Now, by entering the T.C. and the O.C., the conciliators
have reached the parting of the ways. On the one hand, the
fact of the break with the C.C.B.A. is recognition and
correction of conciliationist errors. On the other, the formation
of a separate faction against the Bolsheviks, and the
alliance with the least steady Poles, is a step in continuation
of their old errors.

It is our duty to warn all Bolsheviks of this peril, and
to call on them to unite all their forces and to fight for the
conference. One and all must be mobilised for this struggle.
The Bolsheviks must win, in order to take the Party on to
the high road.

Since the revolution, the Bolsheviks, as a trend, have
lived through two errors—(1) otzovism-Vperyodism and
(2) conciliationism (Wobbling in the direction of the
liquidators). It is time to get rid of both.
 

We Bolsheviks have resolved on no account to repeat (and
not to allow a repetition of) the error of conciliationism
today. This would mean slowing down the rebuilding of
the R.S.D.L.P., and entangling it in a new game with the
Golos people (or their lackeys, like Trotsky), the Vperyodists
and so forth. But this is a critical time, and there can be no
delay.

All Bolsheviks must unite, organise the conference
speedily and at all costs, win a victory at it or go over to open
and straightforward opposition based on principle. Only
Bolshevism, which is alien to waverings either to the left
or to the right, can bring the Party out on to the high road.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Central Committee Bureau Abroad was set up by decision
of a Plenary Meeting of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. in August 1908 as
the general Party centre abroad, which was subordinate to the
Russian Collegium of the Central Committee. Soon after the
January Plenum of the C.C. in 1910, the liquidators obtained a majority
in the Bureau, and it became the rallying point of anti-Party
forces. The Bureau’s liquidationist tactics forced the Bolsheviks to

__PRINTERS_P_643_COMMENT__
41*

   

recall their representative (Alexandrov—N. A. Semashko) in May
1911. Later the representatives of the Polish and Lettish
Social-Democrats were also recalled.

The Bureau dissolved itself in January 1912.





[2]
The Organising Commission Abroad and the Technical Commission
Abroad were formed in June 1911 at a meeting of Central
Committee members to prepare for the Prague Party conference.

The Bolsheviks withdrew from the commissions and disclaimed
any responsibility for their activity, because most of their
members (M. K. Vladimirov, V. L. Leder, A. I. Lyubimov and others)
followed a conciliatory line and refused to abide by the decisions
of the Russian Organising Commission.





[3]
Golosists—Menshevik-liquidators (P. B. Axelrod, F. I. Dan, L. 
Martov, A. S. Martynov, A. N. Potresov and others) grouped round
Golos Sotsial-Demokrata (Voice of the Social-Democrat) which
was published first in Geneva, and later, from February 1908 to
December 1911, in Paris.





[4]
Otzovism (from otzyvat—recall)—an opportunist trend which
emerged among the Bolsheviks in 1908. Behind the otzovists’
revolutionary slogans was the demand for a recall of the
Social-Democratic deputies from the Duma and an end to activity in legal
organisations. They declared that in the conditions of reaction, the
Party should conduct illegal activities only, and refused to take
part in the Duma, trade unions, co-operatives and other legal
and semi-legal mass organisations. For details on the otzovists,
see Lenin’s article “The Faction of Supporters of Otzovism and
God-Building” (present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 29–61).





[5]
Vperyod group—an anti-Party group consisting of otzovists,
ultimatumists, god-builders and empirio-monists (proponents of the
reactionary idealist philosophy of Mach and Avenarius); the group
was organised in December 1909, on the initiative of A. Bogdanov
and G. Alexinsky, and included A. V. Lunacharsky, M. N. Lyadov,
M. N. Pokrovsky and A. V. Sokolov. They published the magazine
Vperyod (Forward). In 1912, they united with the
Menshevik-liquidators into an anti-Party bloc (August bloc), which was
organised by Trotsky. The group failed to find support among
the workers and broke up in 1913. It was finally disbanded after
the February revolution in 1917.

A reference to Lenin’s “Notes of a Publicist”, specifically the
part where he analyses the stand of the “conciliators” adopted
at the January 1910 Plenum of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee
(see present edition, Vol. 16, pp. 226–31).

September 15, 1911

Dear A. M.,

It must have been two months ago that I wrote to you
last—at the beginning of the
school[1] (it is now over, and
the students have gone away). There was no reply, and I
was wondering whether the “negotiations” had become
protracted or whether anything had radically changed.
Leshchenko was here the other day and told me about Capri,
and I was very glad to learn that the whole trouble was
the postponement of the meetings you had had in mind until
“after the
fair”.[2] But the plans at Capri, Leshchenko
said, were unchanged: a literary monthly, a full-sized paper
and also, I understand, a tabloid.

Yes, all this would be very welcome indeed just now.
The liquidators are buying Kievskaya Kopeika (so they
say in St. Petersburg, whence we had a letter today), and
are transferring it to St. Petersburg. It would be extremely
important to organise a counter-attack.

So far we have been able only to collect our last cash
for reviving Zvezda. I very much count on your help: send
us an article. Help is particularly important at the
beginning, because it won’t be easy to resume an interrupted
publication.

Have you received the pamphlet by Kamenev, and have
you read it? I cherish the hope that it must dissipate some
of the prejudices you seem to have against its author.

Our Party affairs are in a pretty mess, but still things
are coming to a head. Plekhanov is hedging, he always acts
that way—it’s like a disease—before things break. Martov
sent Kautsky and Zetkin the translation (in typescript)

    

of his pamphlet, and this was a great help to us: both
Kautsky and Clara Zetkin said some pretty harsh things about the
pamphlet: the former called it “disgusting”, the latter
“dirty”.

Well, all the best. Do write for Zvezda.

Drop me a line, if you feel equal to the effort. Warm
greetings to Maria Fyodorovna.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In the summer of 1911, the Bolshevik centre set up a Party school
in Longjumeau near Paris for Party workers coming from Russia.
Among the lecturers were Lenin, Inessa Armand and N. A.

   

Semashko. Among those who attended the lectures and seminars
were G. K. Orjonikidze, Y. D. Zevin, I. I. Schvarz, the workers
I. S. Belostotsky, A. I. Dogadov, and I. V. Prisyagin. Graduates
carried out important Party work in Russia.

For details of the letter mentioned by Lenin, see present edition,
Vol. 34, pp. 446–47.

The “fair” was apparently a code name for the meeting of C.C.
members in Paris on May 28–June 4 (June 10–17), 1911.

Dear Comrade,

I have received your letter and replied by telegram.

To avoid any misunderstandings, here are a few more
details. What I meant was a public lecture (“Stolypin and
the Revolution”), with the admission fees to go for the
benefit of Rabochaya Gazeta (of course there is no need,
or at any rate it’s not obligatory, to say in the
advertisement for whose benefit it
is).[1] The presiding committee
(or the chairman) at the meeting must be from among local
Bolsheviks, and by no means “elected” (to avoid intrigues
and scandals, to which the liquidators are very prone).

I am willing to have a talk with pro-Party people (
Plekhanovites), but not with Golosists. It would be best of all
to confine the audience to Bolsheviks.

I hope to arrive on Thursday; I will send you a telegram
about the time of arrival, if I can manage it.

Please be kind enough to send this letter at once to Gorin
[M. Gorine. Rue du Pont Neuf. 2. (Chez M-me Vire) Genève],
to enable him to take steps to organise a similar lecture at
Geneva on Saturday, and to reply to me through you by
Thursday.

All the best,
 Lenin

As regards literature for the lecture, please get together
for me
(α) a file of the C.O.,
(β) Two
Parties,
(γ) Dnevnik,
(δ)
Arkomed.[2]

Saturday’s editorial in Rech, September 15, is a virtual
exposition of the basic political principles of the
Constitutional-Democratic Party. What do these principles of
the main party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie amount
to now?

They amount to three points:
(1) “extension of the
franchise”;
(2) “radical reform of the Council of
State”[1]; and,
(3) “responsibility of the Ministry to the people’s
representatives”. It goes without saying that to this are added
freedom of association (coalitions) and all the other freedoms,
equality of nationalities, “restraint and slowing down”
of differentiation in the countryside, and so on and so
forth.

Readers should compare these “three points” of the
liberals with the “three points” of working-class democrats,
who have given an effective reply to the political question,
the labour question and the peasant question alike.
The actual source of all the evils and misfortunes, their
real “focus”, and the way out are indicated clearly and
explicitly by the “three points” of the working-class
democrats.

But the liberal platform—for, not nominally but in
substance, it is an election platform—of the Cadets is only
a wish for modest constitutional reforms. It differs very
little from the wishes of the Octobrists.

The main thing has been obscured; on the main thing
the liberal-monarchist bourgeois party has nothing to say.
The Cadets want “to win by modesty”, but then let us

    

recall that Messrs. Guchkovs have already tried modesty in
practice. And what was the result? The result was nil!

We want very little, the Cadets boast. But, gentlemen,
that “trump” has already been played by the Octobrists.
In all three Dumas, the Cadets and the Octobrists vied
with each other in assuring the “government” and the “
public” that they want very little, a modest minimum on the
European standard. The result is nil!

No, gentlemen, whether you list constitutional reforms
in three points or in twenty, your platform will be a dead
one. You can talk about constitutional reforms, without
appearing ridiculous, only where and when the foundations
and pillars of political liberty already exist, where and
when they are established, assured and stable.

You yourselves know that that is not yet the case in
Russia, and therefore your pious wishes do not show the people
a way out but mislead them with illusory hopes!

The issue of Luck, the liquidators’ newspaper, put out (as a
Pravda correspondent rightly points out) on polling day
to disrupt unity, is filled to overflowing with talk of “unity”.

The decisive moment in the elections to the
workers’
curia[1] in St. Petersburg Gubernia will arrive in a few
days, on Friday, October 5. On that day, the representatives
of the workers will elect
6 electors.[2] It is these elections
that are of decisive importance, because unless all the
electors are steadfast, consistent working-class democrats and
opponents of liquidationism, there will be no serious
guarantee that the deputy elected to the Duma will be one the
majority of class-conscious workers want.

In order not to fail at the crucial moment, one must have
a clear understanding of the tasks of working-class
democrats and the situation in which the representatives are
acting.

The essence of the problem today is that under cover
of shouts about unity, the liquidators are flouting the will
of the majority of class-conscious workers in St. Petersburg,
and are foisting on the majority of the workers the splinter
candidates of the minority intelligentsia, namely, the
liquidationist intelligentsia.

All elections in a bourgeois country are accompanied
by rampant phrase-mongering and licentious promises. The
main principle of Social-Democrats is not to trust words
but go to the heart of the matter.

The liquidators’ phrases about unity in their newspaper
Luck are a pack of lies. In reality, unity has already been
brought about in St. Petersburg by the majority of
class-conscious workers against the liquidators; it was established

    

by the May Day demonstration, and by the support given to
Pravda by 550 groups of workers against the 16 groups of
liquidators.

Now that is action, not talk. When 550 groups unite
against 16, it is unity. When 16 foist “their” candidate
on 550, it is a split.

The liquidators are carrying out a split, while shouting
about unity on the “Stop thief!” principle.

Class-conscious workers should not let themselves be
deceived by empty shouts and phrases.

Don’t trust words, take a sober look at the state of affairs.
The vast majority of Marxist workers are opponents of
liquidationism. An insignificant minority of workers favour
the liquidators, and the “strength” of the liquidators lies
in the bourgeois intelligentsia, which is in a position to
put out a journal, found a new paper on polling day, get
hold of “contacts”, people for intellectuals’ election
committees, and so forth.

Every Social-Democrat in St. Petersburg knows these
facts.

This clarifies the significance of the liquidators’ shouts
about unity. Under cover of these shouts, the bourgeois
intelligentsia, which sympathises with the liquidators, wants
to destroy the unity of the workers by foisting on them the
liquidators’ candidate.

That is the heart of the matter. That is the “crafty design”
of the liquidator Luch.

Whoever wants the genuine unity of Marxist workers
must help to elect all the anti-liquidator electors.

Whoever wants genuine unity will help to give effect to
the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers.

Whoever helps the minority to flout their will is a most
malicious disrupter, however loud his shouts of unity!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Curias—in Russia, divisions of voters classified by estate and
property qualifications for elections to the Duma, which were
designed to pack the Duma with members of the ruling classes.

There were four curias in the elections to the First and Second
Dumas: worker, urban, landowner and peasant.





[2]
Elections to the Duma were held in several stages: workers,
peasant delegates, landowners and the urban bourgeoisie, at their
congresses, elected representatives who, at their uyezd meetings,
chose electors to the gubernia meetings where the deputies were
finally elected.

Dear K.,

I have not been following the recent peace congresses.
I know about the participation of the socialists—and about
its opportunist character—but only from
hearsay.[1]

I will not undertake to express myself definitely on
this question before I have read the reports of at least one
congress. The question is a complicated one. The general
growth of opportunism, and the “balancing” of its forces
with those of revolutionary Social-Democracy in the big
countries of the labour movement (Germany), must surely
tell in this sphere too. Let Bebel play the diplomatist with
the opportunists—if this is essential (?)—but it does not
befit us to do so. That’s all I can say just now.

Greetings to Comrade Olga and all our friends, including
Gorin. How is he getting on? What news have you? What
are your relations with Plekhanov? Do you have any talks?

Kamenev, on his way to Paris, will go to Switzerland
to lecture in the autumn (he is now here). Perhaps I, too,
shall manage to come in the winter.

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Letter to the Editors

The undersigned, now in the capacity of a permanent
political contributor to Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda,
considers it his duty to express his protest against the
behaviour of the colleagues in charge of these newspapers
at a critical time.

The elections in St. Petersburg, both in the workers’
curia and in the 2nd urban curia, are a critical moment,
a moment for realising the results of five years of work,
a moment for determining, in many respects, the direction
of work for the next five years.

At such a moment, the leading organ of working-class
democrats must follow a clear, firm, and precisely defined
policy. But Pravda, which is in many respects effectively
the leading organ, is not conducting such a policy.

Luch and
Metallist,[1] with their desperate shouts about
“unity”, are carrying on under that “popular” flag the
worst policy of the liquidators, namely, insubordination of
an insignificant minority to the vast majority of Marxist
workers in St. Petersburg, imposition of the candidate of
some three, five or ten tiny groups of intellectuals and a
handful of workers on hundreds of consistent working-class
democratic groups.

During the few days remaining before the election of
workers’ electors, during the few weeks remaining before
elections in St. Petersburg in the 2nd curia, it is Pravda’s
undoubted duty to carry on a merciless fight against this
deception of the mass of workers, behind the barrage of
pious and popular phrases. Its bounden duty is in the

    

most detailed fashion to explain, demonstrate, chew up for
all and sundry, 1st, that liquidationism is a non-Marxist,
liberal trend;

    2nd, that unity requires the subordination
of the minority to the majority, whereas the liquidators
are beyond doubt, as the experience of eight months’ work
shows, an insignificant minority;

    3rd, that those who want to support the
working-class democracy must know where the mass of
workers stand, and where the philistine intelligentsia, which
is playing at Marxism;

    4th, that the conference which the
liquidators and Luch are fussing about has been denounced and
exposed both by the neutral Plekhanov (he said straight
out that “non-Party and anti-Party elements” took part
in their conference) and even by Alexinsky, who is hostile
to the anti-liquidators.

And so on, and so forth.

Unless Pravda explains all this in good time, it will be
responsible for the confusion and the disruption, since,
having the vast majority of the workers behind it and
having explained matters in good time, Pravda would
most certainly have ensured unity, because the liquidators
are past masters at boasting and threats, but would never
dare act against Pravda.

Pravda itself has admitted that there are two clearly
formalised lines, platforms, collective wills (the August,
or liquidators’, line and the January line). Yet Pravda
creates the opinion that it is carrying on some third line
“of its own”, invented only yesterday by someone and
amounting (as we have learned from St. Petersburg through
other channels, since Pravda’s editorial board has
stubbornly refused to favour us with a reply) either to letting
the liquidators have one of the three candidates, or
handing over to them the whole of the 2nd curia “in
exchange for the workers’ curia”. If these rumours are untrue,
Pravda bears the entire responsibility for them, because
you cannot sow such uncertainty among Marxists that
unquestionable friends, Marxists, believe these rumours,
and pass them on.

At this hot time, Nevskaya Zvezda is closed down,

    

without a single letter or explanation, collective exchange
of opinion is completely interrupted, and political
contributors are left in the dark, not knowing whom they are
helping after all to get elected; may it not be a liquidator?
I am obliged hotly to protest against this, and to decline
any responsibility for this abnormal situation, which is
pregnant with drawn-out conflicts.

Please communicate this letter to the “boss” of Pravda
and Nevskaya Zvezda, to the whole editorial board of both
papers and all contributors who are consistent
working-class democrats.

Greetings,
 V. Ilyin

in St. Petersburg from August 30 (September 12), 1906 to June

the trade union, was in the hands of liquidators. After an election
in 1913, the executive and the editorial board passed into the
hands of the Bolsheviks.

Dear Friend,

Don’t you find it strange that we have had an active
and extremely lively correspondence on one particular
theoretical question, one particular book, one particular
theory, and that we have never had any correspondence on
the vitally urgent questions of that sphere of Russian
journalism in which both of us have had to take some
considerable part in recent times?

I personally find it strange. I think there can absolutely
be no circumstances—and there are none—which could
serve as any kind of justification for the absence of such
correspondence, since you yourself once pointed out, and
quite rightly, that we all feel the harmfulness of
detachment, isolation, a certain solitude, etc.

I hope, therefore, that I will meet with your support
if I start right out with correspondence No. 2 (for No. 1,
about the book and the theory, is proceeding on its own
and will continue to do so).

You were acquainted, I think, though distantly, with
Pokrovsky 2nd? What do you think of the latest
explanation by the Senate? I mean the one under which the tenant
qualification requires actual occupation of the premises?
After all, it looks as though this explanation, made just
before the elections in the 2nd curia, is specifically aimed
at Pokrovsky 2nd, Predkaln, etc.! Can they have any other
qualification in their own localities except that of tenant?
And how could they, being members of the Duma, “actually
occupy” their apartments in their localities for, say, a
year? And if they are being “explained”, should not
Pokrovsky 2nd be invited to stand in St. Petersburg, where

    

he probably has a qualification that is much more reliable,
i.e., one less subject to “explanation”? I personally would
very much sympathise with such a candidature in St. 
Petersburg (alongside the two evidently indisputable candidates
who caused the stupid and brazen Luck to come out
with its stupid and brazenly cowardly repudiation). I shall
be most grateful if you summon the effort to drop me a
line or two (in reply to my 200) on your views of this matter.

Furthermore, I should like to discuss the two workers’
papers at St. Petersburg. Luch is base and unprincipled:
it’s not a paper, but a “leaflet for subverting” the
Social-Democratic candidate. But they know how to fight, they
are lively and glib. Meanwhile Pravda is carrying on now,
at election time, like a sleepy old maid. Pravda doesn’t
know how to fight. It does not attack, it does not
persecute either the Cadet or the liquidator. But can an organ
of forward-looking democrats not be a fighting organ at
a hot time like this? Let’s give it the benefit of the doubt:
let’s assume that Pravda is sure that the anti-liquidators
will win. All the same it should fight to let the country
know what is involved, who is disrupting the election
campaign, and what ideas are at stake in the struggle.
Luch is fighting furiously, hysterically, abandoning its
principles in the most shameless fashion. Pravda—to
spite it—puts on a “serious mien”, affects various airs
and graces, and fails to fight at all! Does that look like
Marxism? After all, didn’t Marx know how to combine
war, the most passionate, whole-hearted and merciless
war, with complete loyalty to principle?

Not to fight at election time is suicide. Look at what
Luch’s “Cadet-eating” has come to! And the Pravda people
were afraid that we might be overdoing the Cadet-eating!

Best wishes,
 Yours,
 V. Ilyin

Dear Friend,

We learned only today of the liquidators’ victory in
St. Petersburg. An analysis of the figures makes it clear
that they were got through by non-Social-Democrats,
namely, the 11 “non-Party” men who voted for the non-Party
Stepanov. But the figures are incomplete. It is extremely,
extremely important to have the complete figures, i.e.,
(1) the number of votes for and against all 13 candidates;
the newspapers give only the figures for 9 candidates (3
liquidators and 6 of ours); those for 3 liquidators and 1
non-Party candidate are missing. Make every effort to collect
these data. Let several representatives write to the editors
of the papers to establish this fact, if the minutes cannot
be found. The importance of these figures is extremely
great. Spare no effort to discover them.
(2) There should
be a poll of the representatives on who voted how. This is
of particular importance with respect to “our” 7 Putilov
workers+2 of ours from the Semyannikov Works. Collect
the information as speedily, as fully and as precisely as
possible. It is extremely important to learn from the
representatives how the 11 non-Party men voted (apparently
they all voted steadily for the liquidators, but it is
desirable to collect direct evidence).

Dear Colleague,

I wrote to Gorky as you requested, and received a reply
from him today. He writes:

“Send the enclosed note to Pravda. There is no question
of fee, that is nonsense. I will work for the paper, and
will soon begin sending it manuscripts. I couldn’t do it
up to now only because I have been desperately busy, putting
in about 12 hours a day; it’s back-breaking work.”

As you see, Gorky’s attitude is very
friendly.[1]

I hope
you will reciprocate, and see that Pravda is sent to him
regularly. The forwarding department sometimes slips up,
so that from time to time you must check and check again.

If you want to retain his friendly interest, send him
(through me) any new publication which might be of
interest to him, and also any particular manuscripts.

I would very much ask you to send me Pravda Nos. 146,
147, 148 and Nevskaya Zvezda Nos. 26 and 27, at least two
copies of each.

Are you thinking of replying to Luch’s maliciously
vicious attacks? These rascals first broke away, and are
now shouting about a split! Their list did get less (the total
vote for the whole list, all 6 candidates} both on Oct. 17
and on Oct. 18! Get hold without fail of the exact figures
of the polling for all the liquidator candidates, from Zaitsev
or some other of the electors. This is terribly important!
And buy the printed list of representatives at the office

    

of the St. Petersburg city authorities, as I asked! Make
sure to do this without fail!

All the best,
 Yours....

Congratulations and good wishes to all the staff, editors
and friends of Pravda on the occasion of the victory of its
supporters in St. Petersburg, Kharkov and elsewhere!

P.S. Be sure to write now about the circulation of
Pravda and Luch Have you enough material?

November 17, 1912


Dear Comrade,

I have just sent you a telegram about our agreement
to the combination which you decided upon with
Rubanovich.

We ask you to lay before the
commission,[3] by way of
information, our shade of opinion, too, if we happen to
differ with you on the following point.

Kautsky’s article in No. 6 of Neue Zeit, after the October
session of the
I.S.B.,[4] is obviously the official opinion
of the Germans, the Austrians and others. We do not
accept the main point of the article (S. 191–92, from the
words “Dabei
müssen”[1]

to “heischenden
Massen”[2]
in
particular).[5]

With Kautsky it turns out to be a pledge against a
revolutionary mass strike. This is inadmissible both from
the Russian standpoint (there are 100,000 political strikers
now in St. Petersburg, with revolutionary meetings and
sympathies for the sailors’ mutiny) and from the general
European standpoint. However, you know our point of
view from our writings, and I hope you will not object to
having a talk with Comrade Kamenev.

Comrade Kamenev is our delegate to the I.S.B. (M. 
Rosenfeld, 11. Rue Roli. 11. Paris XIV).

Please cable him if you are not going, and if you are,

    

please see him before the commission at Basle (M. 
Rosenfeld. Poste Restante, Bâle).

If you don’t go for some reason, please send your vote
in writing for the election (of Rubanovich or Kamenev) to
the commission.

Respectfully yours,
 N. Lenin

Wl. Uljanow. 47. Lubomirskiego. Autriche. Krakau.

Congress of the Second International for working out a manifesto
against the war danger. The Congress, called in connection with
the Balkan war and the mounting threat of a world-wide
imperialist war, was held on November 24 and 25,1912. The commission
consisted of one delegate each from France, Germany, Britain and
Russia. By agreement between representatives of the R.S.D.L.P.
and the International Socialist Bureau, the Russian member was
I. Rubanovich, a Socialist-Revolutionary. On November 25, the
Congress unanimously adopted a manifesto calling on the workers
to make use of the proletariat’s organisation and strength for
waging a revolutionary struggle against the threat of war.

The I.S.B. meeting, held in Brussels on October 28 and 29, 1912,
decided to call an extraordinary socialist congress. Russia was
represented by Plekhanov and Rubanovich. The I.S.B. held a
special closed sitting to discuss Russian affairs.

We have already pointed out in
Pravda[1] the great
importance of the Republican Party split in America and
the formation of Roosevelt’s Progressive
Party.[2]

Now the elections are over. The Democrats have won,
and at once the consequences predicted by the socialists
are beginning to tell. Roosevelt’s Progressive Party, with
its 4.5 million votes, is a specimen of the broad
bourgeois-reformist trend which has come on the scene in sweeping
American fashion.

What happens to this trend is of general interest because,
in one form or another, it exists in all capitalist countries.

In any bourgeois-reformist trend there are two main
streams: the bourgeois bigwigs and politicians, who deceive
the masses with promises of reform, and the cheated masses,
who feel that they cannot go on living in the old way, and
follow the quack with the loudest promises. And so we find
the brand-new Progressive Party in America splitting at
the seams right after the elections.

The bourgeois politicians who made use of Roosevelt’s
quackery to dupe the masses are already yelling about a
merger with the Republican Party. What’s the idea? It
is simply this: the politicians want the cushy jobs which
the victorious party in America hands out to its supporters
with especial brazenness. The Republican split gave the
victory to the Democrats. These are now ecstatically sharing
out the luscious public pie. Is it surprising that their rivals
are prepared to renounce the Progressive Party and return
to the consolidated Republican Party, which has every
chance of defeating the Democrats?

Indeed, this looks very much like a cynical cheap sale

    

of “party loyalties”. But we see exactly the same thing in
all capitalist countries; and the less freedom there is in
a country, the dirtier and fouler is this sale of party
loyalties among the bourgeois sharks, and the greater is the
importance of backstairs intrigues and private connections
in procuring concessions, subsidies, bonanza legal cases
(for the lawyers), etc.

The other wing of any bourgeois-reformist trend—the
cheated masses—has now also revealed itself in the highly
original, free and lucid American style. “Scores who had
voted for the Progressive Party, ” writes Appeal to
Reason,[3]
the New York workers’ paper, “now come to socialist
editorial offices and bureaux for all kinds of information.
They are mostly young people, trusting, inexperienced.
They are the sheep shorn by Roosevelt, without any
knowledge of politics or economics. They instinctively feel
that the Socialist Party, with its one million votes, is a
more serious proposition than Roosevelt’s 4.5 million, and
what they want to know most is whether the minimum
reforms promised by Roosevelt can be implemented.”

“Needless to say,” the paper adds, “we are glad to give
every one of these ‘progressives’ any information, and never
let any of them leave without socialist literature.”

The lot of capitalism is such that its sharpest operators
cannot help “working”—for socialism!

Dear Colleagues,

I am in urgent need of No. 8 of Pravda. You wrote that
you hadn’t got it. Please insert the following
advertisement in Pravda—I write Nos. 5–10, instead of No. 8, to
be on the safe side.

This is often done. I particularly ask you to do this.

Yours,
 V. Ilyin

What’s the matter with Olminsky? Is it true that he is
ill?

To complete our file, we are in need of 1 copy each

send in their spare copies.

Each has his own preoccupations: the proletariat sees
the need for peace, and the capitalists look to the “
patriotic” examples provided by the Balkan War. To each his
own. The workers insist that in terms of human life a Balkan
revolution would have cost a hundred times less than the
Balkan War, and would have produced democratic results
a thousand times broader and more stable.

The capitalists—both the “Right” and the liberals,
all the way up to our Progressists and Cadets—are
straining to prove that whereas the banded capitalists in the
Balkans have pocketed so much, the banded capitalists
of Britain, France and Russia, as an “entente”, could
have made off with ever so much more.

One American “patriot”, a patriot of the money-bag,
managed to find out that some ships in the Greek navy
had been built by Greek millionaire magnates at their
own expense.

This American Guchkov or Maklakov hastened to
advertise and play up the grand patriotic example in every way.
He wrote: “Now if only our country’s shores and all our
overseas trade were protected by giant dreadnoughts called
Morgan, Astor, Vanderbilt and Rockefeller! With such
an example before them, the people would grumble less
about the concentration of capital in the hands of
billionaires and about the unequal distribution of wealth!”

Patriotic, but impractical, say the American workers
laughing. Gentlemen, go ahead with your splendid scheme,
we’re all for it. Until now, the Rockefellers, Morgans,
etc., over here in America have been hiring private
detachments of armed men to protect their property and fight

    

strikers. Let the billionaires now give the people a clear
picture showing that the “external” defence of the “state”
is defence of the monopolies and the profits of the owners
of our trusts! Let’s see what lesson the American workers
will learn as they contemplate these super-dreadnoughts
named Morgan, Rockefeller, etc.: will it be patriotic
emotion or socialist convictions? Will they become more
servile to the capitalists, or will they demand with greater
firmness that all trusts (manufacturers’ associations),
all the property of the trusts, should be handed over to the
workers, to society as a whole?

...The American “patriot” has overdone it....

We noted in Pravda the other day (see
No.   )[1] the
article by the student M. which provides remarkably
valuable material about “student moods”. On students’
party affiliation, the writer says:


“Of course, a comparatively limited section of the students are
members of Left-wing organisations. In existing conditions, it could
not be otherwise, and in general the strength of organisations is
determined not by the number of their members, but by their influence on
the masses. It is hard to make a guess about the future, but it should
be pointed out that today the Left-wing organisations are marching
in step with the mass of the students” (Zaprosy
Zhizni[2] No. 47).


The author is quite right when he says that with us in
Russia, particularly in the current political conditions,
“the strength of organisations is determined not by the
number of their members, but by their influence on the
masses”.
This would not hold true for Europe; nor would it
hold true for Russia in the autumn of 1905; but for
present-day Russia it is so true that one might even venture
what looks like a paradox: the number of members of an
organisation should not exceed a definite minimum, if
its influence on the masses is to be broad and stable!

But what is the party attitude of these “Left-wing”
organisations among the students? Student M. writes:


“It should be particularly noted that one does not feel any
dissension among the individual Left-wing organisations. Such dissension
was particularly strong three or so years ago, during the period of lull
and inaction. There were cases when elections to canteen commissions
and the like were held according to party lists. Now these divisions
have almost disappeared, partly because everyone has realised the need
to join forces for common action, partly because the old party

    

positions have been unsettled and the new ones have yet to be
consolidated.”


There can be no doubt that in this respect, as well, the
students provide a reflection of an all-Russia phenomenon.
Everywhere, throughout the democratic movement, and
also among the workers, “the old party positions have
been unsettled and the new ones have yet to be
consolidated ”.
What is liquidationism? It is either a
pusillanimous concession to the spirit of the times, to the atmosphere
of “unsettlement” of the old party positions, or the
malicious utilisation of this unsettlement by the liberals.

The task of the whole democratic movement is to fight
with all its strength against this “unsettlement”, and to
achieve a precise, clear, definite, thoughtful “
consolidation” of the “new positions”. It would be a great mistake
to confuse the arguments and discussions on party (and
inner-party) platforms with “dissensions”.

It is absolutely necessary “to join forces for common
action”, including, for instance, those of Marxists and
Narodniks. This does not obviate a definite party stand,
but, on the contrary, demands it. It is possible to combine
action only when there is real unity of conviction as to
whether the particular action is necessary. That is as clear
as daylight. Russian democracy has been the worse for
trying to “join forces” for democratic action with non-
democrats, with the liberals!

Try and “join the forces” of the supporters, shall we say,
of political strikes with the “forces” of their adversaries:
there will obviously be harm for the “action”. Hence,
the first thing to do is to achieve a clear, definite, precise,
well-thought-out delimitation of “positions”, platforms and
programmes—and then to combine the forces that can
march together by conviction and social nature; combine
them only for the action on which unanimity can be
expected. Then, and only then, will any good come of the
undertaking.

Your letter is the first, I believe, to offer a “report” on
Basle![2] It’s rather late.... Evidently something was
lacking (or in excess?) at Basle.... I believe that what
the delegates lacked was organisation. And that is
extremely sad. Kamenev, of course, was run off his feet, but
what about the other five? Was it really not clear that
it was necessary to write to Pravda daily? Was it really so
difficult to assign the various duties? We’ve not had a
single letter in Pravda from the spot, while the liquidators
had several in Luch.

Isn’t it a shame? Of course, so long as we sleep and the
liquidators work, they will make more headway. Is
anything being done to collect money for Pravda? It doesn’t
look like it, while the liquidators have reports in Luch
of collections abroad. Yet Pravda is very, very, very much
in need.

Not a single one of the delegates (except Kamenev) has
written here about Basle. It was essential to get organised
and write twice a day. But all kept silent. Evidently there
is some dissatisfaction. What with? God only knows! I am
tremendously satisfied with the results of Basle, because
the liquidator idiots let themselves be caught out on the
question of the initiating
group![3] You couldn’t have
pinned down the riffraff better. But I’m worried by the
inactivity of our delegates, and a sort of “in-the-pouts”
behaviour on their part, for no apparent reason. Did they
talk with the German delegates? (After all, 4 or 5 did know
German!) Who? With whom? How? What about? There’s
not a word, except from Kamenev. Agitation among the
Germans is very important.
 

You write that “with us things are not too good in the
press and in the Duma group”. They are not too good with
Prosveshcheniye.[4] There is no money. It’s a serious crisis.
It should be given help to enable it to pull through.

Pravda’s circulation is about 23,000. Luch has 8,000–
9,000. It would be sinful to complain thus far. But in
April and May Pravda had 60,000, and in the summer
dropped to 20,000. It’s rising very slowly. Without help
it won’t pull through. In the Duma group things are better
than ever before. All the six seats in the workers’ curia
are
ours.[5] That’s something we’ve never had. For the first
time, we have taken the South. Six and six out of 12.
Mankov is a Menshevik. Rusanov is a question mark. We can
fight. Here are precise data on our progress. Deputies in
the workers’ curia:

II Duma— 12 Mensheviks, 11 Bolsheviks (=47%)

III Duma— 4 ” 4 ” (=50%)

IV Duma— 3 ” 6 ” (=67%)

(“Minutes of
London Congress”,
p. 451).[6]


If you have anyone anywhere who is losing heart, let
him think over these figures and be ashamed of his
faint-heartedness. For the first time we have among our people
in the Duma an outstanding workers’ leader (Malinovsky).
He will read the declaration. There’s no comparing him
with Alexinsky. And the results—maybe not at once—
will be great. In the III Duma we started out with 0!

In the sphere of illegal work, thanks to the Bureau’s
moving here, more has been done than before. We are
moving ahead, even if slowly. We are publishing illegally
more than others. But we have no money. If we get help,
we shall also publish Rabochaya Gazeta, etc.

Illegal work can be helped from abroad only by visits.
Then help is very important in the form of new connections
(1) letters;
(2) chance visits;
(3) passports;
(4) etc., etc.
What is being done in this respect is not enough. Only one
per cent is being done in the localities abroad of what could
be done. The most important thing right now is to help
Pravda to pull through. And it is getting poor help. One
man in Vienna (Bukharin) is making an effort. But nothing
is being done in the other cities! No one writes regular
reports. No one makes collections. No one collects

    

interesting local books and pamphlets for dispatch
here ...[1]

material for interesting articles. Comrades, we must give more
thought to these things! For example, who among the
Social-Democrats at Neuenburg in Switzerland ... has done
anything? What has been done about it?

All the best....

P.S. Please send this letter to Yuri, for him to pass on
to Antonov in Paris, and from there on to Vienna. To this
day, we have not yet found out whether Plekhanov had
spoken at the October meeting of the Bureau on unity
with the S.R.s (cf. Martov in No. 37 of
Luch.[7]) Didn’t
anyone make inquiries about this with Rubanovich, or
N&ewhatthemec, or Huysmans, or anyone else?

The 32nd Annual Convention of the American
Federation of Labour, as the association of trade unions is called,
has come to a close in Rochester. Alongside the rapidly
growing Socialist Party, this association is a living relic
of the past: of the old craft-union, liberal-bourgeois
traditions that hang full weight over America’s
working-class aristocracy.

On August 31, 1911, the Federation had 1,841,268
members. Samuel Gompers, a strong opponent of socialism,
was re-elected President. But Max Hayes, the socialist
workers’ candidate, received 5,074 votes against Gompers’s
11,974, whereas previously Gompers used to be elected
unanimously. The struggle of the socialists against the
“trade unionists ” in the American trade union movement is
slowly but surely leading to the victory of the former over
the latter.

Gompers not only fully accepts the bourgeois myth of
“harmony between labour and capital”, but carries on a
downright bourgeois policy in the Federation against the
socialist one, although he professes to stand for the
complete political “neutrality” of the trade unions! During
the recent presidential elections in America, Gompers
reprinted in the Federation’s official publication the
programmes and platforms of all three bourgeois parties
(Democrats, Republicans and Progressists) but did not
reprint the programme of the Socialist Party!

Protests against this mode of action were voiced at the
Rochester Convention even by Gompers’s own followers.

The slate of affairs in the American labour movement
shows us, as it does in Britain, the remarkably clear-cut

    

division between purely trade unionist and socialist
strivings, the split between bourgeois labour policy and socialist
labour policy. For, strange as it may seem, in capitalist
society even the working class can carry on a bourgeois
policy, if it forgets about its emancipatory aims, puts up
with wage-slavery and confines itself to seeking alliances
now with one bourgeois party, now with another, for the
sake of imaginary “improvements” in its indentured
condition.

The principal historical cause of the particular
prominence and (temporary) strength of bourgeois labour policy
in Britain and America is the long-standing political liberty
and the exceptionally favourable conditions, in comparison
with other countries, for the deep-going and widespread
development of capitalism. These conditions have tended
to produce within the working class an aristocracy that
has trailed behind the bourgeoisie, betraying its own class.

In the twentieth century, this peculiar situation in
Britain and America is rapidly disappearing. Other countries
are catching up with Anglo-Saxon capitalism, and the
mass of workers are learning about socialism at first hand.
The faster the growth of world capitalism, the sooner will
socialism triumph in America and Britain.

  ARTICLE
   THREE[1]

The Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma was the
first Social-Democratic parliamentary group in Russia
to manage to exist for several years and to stand a long
“test” of working jointly with the party of the working
class. For obvious reasons we cannot here tell the story of
this work. We can and must point out only the most
important feature: what was the impact of the Party’s
development on the Duma group, and how did relations between
the group and the Party change?

First of all, we have to establish the fact that the early
steps in the activity of the Social-Democratic group in
the Third Duma aroused the strong dissatisfaction and
sharp disapproval of the Majority of the Party. The group
was largely dominated by the Mensheviks, who were in
opposition to the Party’s 1907
decisions,[2] and the
Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma continued or took
over this “opposition.”

A kind of struggle began between the Party and the
group. The group’s declaration was attacked—and quite
rightly—for its opportunism. The periodicals which
represented the opinion of the Majority of the Party, or of
the Party as a whole, repeatedly criticised the group’s
opportunist steps, and noted that on a number of questions
the group had either failed to set forth the Party’s views
in full, or had expressed them wrongly.

A long list of the mistakes and erroneous actions of the
Third Duma group subject to correction was officially

    

recognised in December
1908.[3] Naturally, it was clearly
stated at the time that the responsibility fell not only
on the group, but also on the whole Party, which ought to
pay more attention to its Duma group and work more
closely with it.

The results of that work are there for all to see. Between
1908 and 1912, the Right wing of Menshevism in the Party
developed into liquidationism. The four-year struggle
of both Bolsheviks and pro-Party
Mensheviks[4] against
liquidationism cannot be excised from history, however
much Luch would like to do so.

During these four years, the Social-Democratic Duma
group, from being in opposition to the Party, from being
a group criticised by the Party and defended (and
sometimes directly encouraged in its opportunism) by the
Mensheviks, became an anti-liquidationist group.

The group’s connections with the various newspapers by
1912 have provided documentary evidence of this.
Astrakhantsev and Kuznetsov contributed to the liquidationist
Zhivoye Dyelo. Belousov did too, but he soon left the group
altogether, sending it an extremely liquidationist message
with sympathetic references to Martov and Nasha
Zarya[5]
(Mr. Belousov’s historic message will probably soon appear
in the press).

Furthermore, Shurkanov wrote both for the liquidationist
and for the anti-liquidationist newspapers. Gegechkori
and Chkheidze wrote for neither. The other 8 members of
the group (Voronin, Voiloshnikov, Yegorov, Zakharov,
Pokrovsky, Predkaln, Poletayev and Surkov) contributed
to the anti-liquidationist publications.

In 1911–12 Nasha Zarya repeatedly expressed its
dissatisfaction with the Social-Democratic Duma group: the
liquidators could not be pleased at the Menshevik group’s
siding with the anti-liquidators.

The experience of work in the Black-Hundred Duma, and
the experience of struggle against the Right wing of
Menshevism, which has sunk into the swamp of
liquidationism, all tended to push the Social-Democratic group in
the Third Duma to the left, towards the Party, and away
from opportunism.

Very many, especially those who find it unpleasant,

    

are wont to forget this remarkable story of the four-year
struggle of the Party for a Party attitude in the group
(which only means, of course, its ideological orientation,
its line). But the story is a fact. It should be remembered.
It should be the point of departure in assessing the work
of the group in the Fourth Duma. Of this, more in the
next article.

   ARTICLE FIVE

The resolution on the Jagiello
issue[2] was the first
step of the Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma
which gave an idea of its composition and direction of
activity. We learn from the newspapers that it was adopted
by 7 Menshevik votes against 6 Bolsheviks. Consequently,
it is clear that we have here a decision adopted contrary
to the opinion of the majority of the Party, since the 6 
worker deputies from the six chief industrial gubernias represent,
as we have seen, the vast majority of the working-class
party.

But, perhaps, the content of the resolution shows it to
be correct?

Let us turn to the content.

Clause 1 refers to “the lack of precise data for
establishing whether the larger or the smaller part of the Warsaw
proletariat gave their votes”
for Jagiello as an “elector”.

So, in the opinion of 7 Social-Democratic deputies,
the question is not clear. Yet they speak quite definitely
of the Warsaw, and not of the Polish, proletariat, as the
liquidators and the Bund do (see Luch and Nasha Zarya).
But we know for sure that the “Warsaw proletariat” “has
chosen as electors” two Social-Democrats and one
P.S.P.[3]
man (Jagiello).

Two are a majority as against one. So that there are very
precise data to the effect that Jagiello was voted in by a
minority. What is more, the majority of the worker electors
(both Social-Democrats) were against the election of Jagiello,

    

and made a formal declaration to that effect. The
liquidators referred to Jagiello’s larger vote, but this does not
eliminate the fact that two Social-Democrats and one P.S.P.
member were chosen as electors.

In any case, by ignoring in its resolution the protest
of the two Social-Democratic electors, who represented
all the Polish Social-Democrats in Warsaw, the Seven
acted in an anti-Party way, because until now only the
Polish Social-Democrats have been affiliated to the
Russian Social-Democratic Party.

But the 2nd clause of the resolution is even worse. The
election of Jagiello “by Jewish bourgeois electors”, we
are told, “marks the growth of awareness even in
bourgeois circles” (!? in Jewish bourgeois circles?) “of the fact
that only socialists can be real fighters for the just (?!)
interests of oppressed nationalities”.

Everyone knows that the Jewish bourgeois have not
shown the least sign of any such “awareness”. They 
preferred a Polish bourgeois, but were obliged to elect a
socialist for lack of any other supporter of equality. It was not
“the growth of awareness”, but the growth of difficulties
caused by the national struggle among the bourgeois, that
has given deputy Jagiello his seat!

A worker elector can (and should) utilise the “difficulties”
of two thieves who have fallen out to get an honest man
into the Duma. That is unquestionable. The opposite view
held by a section of the Polish Social-Democrats (the
so-called chief executive which has lost the chief city, Warsaw)
does not hold good.

But when an honest man has entered the Duma because
two thieves fell out, it is ridiculous and absurd to say that
one of the thieves displayed a “growth of awareness”. It
is this lauding of Jewish bourgeois electors—not at all
necessary even to justify Jagiello’s mandate—that proves
the opportunism of the seven members of the group, and
shows their non-proletarian attitude on the national
question.

The Seven in their resolution should have condemned and
branded national animosity in general, and the Polish
bourgeois for their anti-Semitism in particular—that would
have been something. But to attribute a “growth of

    

awareness” to Jewish bourgeois is merely to display one’s own
lack of awareness.

Clause 3 undertakes to prove that Jagiello is a
Social-Democrat. How is this proved?
(1) “By his statement.”
That is no proof. Party people reckon with the 
organisation of which X is a member, and not with any “statement”
by X. Only the liquidators can forget this
ABC.[1]

(2) “The
support of Jagiello’s candidature by the Bund and P.S.P.
bloc.”

But where, in that case, are the Polish Social-Democrats?
A bloc without them and against them (the withdrawal of
Warsaw’s two Social-Democratic electors) is proof of the
anti-Party attitude of the Bund, as was recognised even by
the conciliation-minded Plekhanov!

In Clause 4 we read: “The P.S.P. is not yet united with
the Russian Social-Democratic Party.” That is a
half-truth! Why have the Seven said nothing of the fact that a
Party resolution (December 1908) had rejected unity with
the P.S.P.? Was it only to please those who would
liquidate the Party?

The conclusion from the whole of this lame and miserable
resolution is separation of “questions of the internal life
of the Russian Social-Democratic Party” from “questions
of political activity in the Duma”. This is a thoroughly
bad separation. Party people cannot separate these
questions. To separate them is to separate the Duma group
from the Party. It is the worst kind of opportunism and the
introduction of great confusion. Tactics are determined
by the Party’s “internal” decisions. Is it these tactics or
some other, “non-Party”, tactics that should be applied
in “political activity in the Duma”?

A candidate of the Bund, which wants to be considered
a section of the Social-Democratic Party, is deprived of
a decisive vote on “questions of the internal life of the
Social-Democratic Party”. This is the only positive point
in the muddled resolution of the seven deputies, who have
been confused by the liquidators.

Class-conscious workers should do their utmost to help
them sort things out, to explain to them the mistake they

    

have made, and to work hard (in the Fourth Duma as they
did in the Third) to straighten out the Duma group. A
mistake at the outset is not so terrible in itself—this was
rightly pointed out by
K. Stalin[4]; what alone is
important is that the working-class democrats should openly
and frankly recognise the mistake and secure its
recognition. Then the continuation will be better than the beginning.

In November of last year—1912—it was twenty-five
years since the death of the French worker-poet, Eugène
Pottier, author of the famous proletarian song, the 
Internationale (“Arise ye starvelings from your slumbers”,
etc.).

This song has been translated into all European and
other languages. In whatever country a class-conscious
worker finds himself, wherever fate may cast him, however
much he may feel himself a stranger, without language,
without friends, far from his native country—he can find
himself comrades and friends by the familiar refrain of
the Internationale.

The workers of all countries have adopted the song of
their foremost fighter, the proletarian poet, and have made
it the world-wide song of the proletariat.

And so the workers of all countries now honour the
memory of Eugène Pottier. His wife and daughter are still
alive and living in poverty, as the author of the 
Internationale lived all his life. He was born in Paris on
October 4, 1816. He was 14 when he composed his first song,
and it was called: Long Live Liberty! In 1848 he was a
fighter on the barricades in the workers’ great battle against
the bourgeoisie.

Pottier was born into a poor family, and all his life
remained a poor man, a proletarian, earning his bread as
a packer and later by tracing patterns on fabrics.

From 1840 onwards, he responded to all great events in
the life of France with militant songs, awakening the
consciousness of the backward, calling on the workers to

    

unite, castigating the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois
governments of France.

In the days of the great Paris Commune (1871), Pottier
was elected a member. Of the 3,600 votes cast, he received
3,352. He took part in all the activities of the Commune,
that first proletarian government.

The fall of the Commune forced Pottier to flee to England,
and then to America. His famous song, the Internationale,
was written in June 1871—you might say, the day after
the bloody defeat in May.

The Commune was crushed—but Pottier’s Internationale
spread its ideas throughout the world, and it is now more
alive than ever before.

In 1876, in exile, Pottier wrote a poem, The Workingmen
of America to the Workingmen of France. In it he described
the life of workers under the yoke of capitalism, their
poverty, their back-breaking toil, their exploitation, and
their firm confidence in the coming victory of their cause.

It was only nine years after the Commune that Pottier
returned to France, where he at once joined the Workers’
Party. The first volume of his verse was published in 1884,
the second volume, entitled Revolutionary Songs, came
out in 1887.

A number of other songs by the worker-poet were published
after his death.

On November 8, 1887, the workers of Paris carried the
remains of Eugène Pottier to the Père Lachaise cemetery,
where the executed Communards are buried. The police
savagely attacked the crowd in an effort to snatch the
red banner. A vast crowd took part in the civic funeral.
On all sides there were shouts of “Long live Pottier!”

Pottier died in poverty. But he left a memorial which
is truly more enduring than the handiwork of man. He was
one of the greatest propagandists by song. When he was
composing his first song, the number of worker socialists
ran to tens, at most. Eugène Pottier’s historic song is now
known to tens of millions of proletarians.

The workers’ choral societies of Germany recently
celebrated a kind of jubilee: the number of worker-singers
reached 100,000, with a total membership of 165,000 in these
societies. The number of women workers in them is 11,000.

The workers’ choirs have their own periodical, 
Arbeiter-Sänger Zeitung, which began to appear regularly only
in 1907.

The beginnings of the workers’ choral societies date
back to the 1860s. A choral section was founded in the
Leipzig Artisans’ Educational Society, and one of its
members was August Bebel.

Ferdinand Lassalle attached great importance to the
organising of workers’ choirs. At his insistence, members
of the General Association of German
Workers[2] founded,
at Frankfurt am Main in 1863, a workers’ society called
the Choral Union. This Union held its meetings in the
dark and smoky back room of a Frankfurt tavern. The
room was lit with tallow candles.

There were 12 members of the Union. Once, when
Lassalle, on one of his speaking tours, stayed overnight at
Frankfurt, these 12 worker-singers sang him a song by the
well-known poet Herwegh, whom Lassalle had long been
urging to write the words for a workers’ chorus.

In 1892, after the repeal of the Anti-Socialist
Law,[3]
there were 180 workers’ choral societies in Germany with
4,300 members. In 1901, the membership reached 39,717,
in 1907, 93,000, and by 1912, 165,000. Berlin is said to
have 5,352 members of workers’ choral societies; Hamburg,
1,628; Leipzig, 4,051; Dresden, 4,700, etc.
 

We recently reported how the workers of France and
other Romance countries had marked the 25th anniversary
of the death of Eugene Pettier (1816–1887), the author of
the famous
Internationale.[1]

In Germany, the propaganda
of socialism by workers’ songs is much more recent, and
the “Junker” (landowners’, Black-Hundred) government
of Germany has been throwing up many more foul police
obstacles to such propaganda.

But no amount of police harassment can prevent the
singing of the hearty proletarian song about mankind’s
coming emancipation from wage-slavery in all the great
cities of the world, in all the factory neighbourhoods,
and more and more frequently in the huts of village
labourers.

General Association of German Workers—a political organisation
of the German workers set up at a congress of workers’ societies
in Leipzig in 1863, with the active participation of Ferdinand
Lassalle. The fact that, it was set up was of positive
significance for the working-class movement, but Lassalle, who
was elected President, took it along an opportunist path. It
confined its aims to working for a general franchise and
nonviolent parliamentary activity. Engels said that “‘universal, equal
and direct suffrage’ was propounded by Lassalle as the only and
infallible means of winning political power by the working class” =

(Marx/Engels, Werke, Band 16, Dietz Verlag, Berlin, 1962, S. 
327). Its leadership demanded the establishment of workers’
producer associations subsidised by the state which would
allegedly transform the Prussian state into a “free state of the people ”;
they regarded the peasantry as a reactionary mass. The
Lassalleans approved of the counter-revolutionary way of unifying
Germany “from the top”, through dynastic wars waged by Prussia.
It broke up in 1875.





[3]
The Anti-Socialist Law was introduced in Germany in 1878. It
banned all organisations of the Social-Democratic Party and
mass working-class organisations, closed down all working-class
publications and prohibited all socialist writings. Social–
Democrats were deported. The Law was revoked in 1890 under the
pressure of the mass working-class movement.

Government newspapers and liberal newspapers are full of
news, rumours, speculations and calculations about “Balkan”
policy. What a mess! Sensation follows upon sensation,
each report is more spectacular than the last. Yesterday,
it was said that war was about to break out between Austria
and Montenegro, between Bulgaria and Serbia. Today
there is a spate of denials of yesterday’s news, and
assurances that “peace has been secured”.

Yesterday there were piquant stories about Essad pasha,
his secret treaty with the King of Montenegro, and his
insidious plans for seizing power in Albania. Today comes
denial of these stories, and more piquant reports about
agreements between Austria and Essad.

The man in the street, swallowing everything he is told,
listens to these fables, taking them at their face value,
and blindly following the swindlers who try to divert
“public” attention with exactly the kind of thing that
serves their interest. The man in the street does not suspect
that he is being led by the nose, and that the ringing
phrases about “patriotism”, “the country’s honour and
prestige” and “the Concert of Great Powers” are a deliberate
attempt to cover up the machinations of financial swindlers
and all sorts of capitalist adventurers. The sensational
reports cooked up daily by the big bourgeois newspapers,
whose occupation it is to sell the “latest” and the “most
exciting” news at a profit, are designed specifically to
distract the attention of the crowd from the really important
questions and the real background of “high” politics.

The conservative newspapers in Europe, the

    

Black-Hundred[1] and Octobrist, and also non-party, papers in
our own country, are playing this game crudely and in
primitive fashion. In Russia, for example, they carry daily
incitements against Austria, and depict Russia as the “
protector” of the Slavs. The liberal press, like Rech and similar
other papers, is carrying on the, very same game, only in
more subtle fashion, concealing it more skilfully, making
its “digs” at Austria with greater caution, assuming the
air of statesmen discussing the issues confronting the Concert
of Europe.

In reality, all this quarrelling between Austria am)
Russia, between the Triple Alliance and the Triple
Entente,[2] all these subtle approaches, are nothing but
disputes between capitalist profiteers and capitalist
governments over the division of the spoils. They are trying to
drag the man in the street into the issue of how “we” can
tear off a bigger slice, and how to let “them” have a smaller
one; they are trying to get the man in the street to take
an interest and show concern in the squabbling.

Nothing is being written or said about the number of
skins to be taken off the backs of the peasant and the
worker in Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece to cover the expenses
of war, or in Austria to cover the expenses of mobilisation,
or in Russia for the same purpose and for her imperialist
policy; or whether, and how, democratic institutions are
to be ensured in the “new” states of the Balkans, or in
Armenia, or in Mongolia. That is not news. The profits of
the international sharks do not depend on that.
Democratic institutions even tend to hamper “steady”
profit-making. Instead of exposing the policy of the Great Powers,
the newspapers—both conservative and liberal—are engaged
in discussing how best to help the sharks have their fill
through this policy.

Present-day capitalist society conceals within itself
numerous cases of poverty and oppression which do not
immediately strike the eye. At the best of times, the
scattered families of poor townspeople, artisans, workers,
employees and petty officials live in incredible
difficulties, barely managing to make both ends meet. Millions
upon millions of women in such families live (or, rather,
exist) as “domestic slaves”, striving to feed and clothe
their family on pennies, at the cost of desperate daily
effort and “saving” on everything—except their own labour.

It is these women that the capitalists most willingly
employ as home-workers, who are prepared for a
monstrously low wage to “earn a little extra” for themselves
and their family, for the sake of a crust of bread. It is from
among these women, too, that the capitalists of all
countries recruit for themselves (like the ancient slave-owners
and the medieval feudal lords) any number of concubines
at a most “reasonable” price. And no amount of “moral
indignation” (hypocritical in 99 cases out of 100) about
prostitution can do anything against this trade in female
flesh; so long as wage-slavery exists, inevitably
prostitution too will exist. All the oppressed and exploited
classes throughout the history of human societies have
always been forced (and it is in this that their
exploitation consists) to give up to their oppressors, first, their
unpaid labour and, second, their women as concubines for
the “masters”.

Slavery, feudalism and capitalism are identical in this
respect. It is only the form of exploitation that changes;
the exploitation itself remains.
 

An exhibition of the work of “women exploited at home”
has opened in Paris, the “capital of the world”, and the
centre of civilisation.

Each exhibit has a little tag showing how much the
woman working at home receives for making it, and how
much she can make per day and per hour on this basis.

And what do we find? Not on a single article can a woman
working at home earn more than 1.25 francs, i.e., 50 
kopeks, whereas the earnings on the vast majority of jobs
are very much smaller. Take lampshades. The pay is 4 
kopeks per dozen. Or paper bags: 15 kopeks per thousand,
with earnings at six kopeks an hour. Here are little toys
with ribbons, etc.: 2.5 kopeks an hour. Artificial flowers:
two or three kopeks an hour. Ladies’ and gentlemen’s
underwear: from two to six kopeks an hour. And so on,
without end.

Our workers’ associations and trade unions, too, ought
to organise an “exhibition” of this kind. It will not yield
the colossal profits brought in by the exhibitions, of the
bourgeoisie. A display of proletarian women’s poverty
and indigence will bring a different benefit: it will help
wage-slaves, both men and women, to understand their
condition, look back over their “life”, ponder the
conditions for emancipation from this perpetual yoke of want,
poverty, prostitution and every kind of outrage against
the have-nots.

If the newspaper Novoye Vremya is quite deservedly
“famed” for being one of the most dishonest newspapers,
which adapts itself to profitable business interests, to the
government, and to the ruling class of landowners, its
correspondent Menshikov is doubly famed, and with even
better reason.

Menshikov’s articles frequently allow readers to make
a sure guess as to which “circles” in official, capitalist,
or aristocratic St. Petersburg had ordered this or that
statement by him. Not very long ago, this Menshikov was
ordered an article in defence of the “aristocratic” Council
of State against the plans for its supposedly democratic
reform. The article had clearly been ordered by
high-ranking official landowner circles. All the more instructive
is it then to hear what the landowners have to say about
the notorious “pacification” of the countryside.

“I have fairly frequent calls from provincials visiting
St. Petersburg, landowners and public men,” says
Menshikov. Whether the landowners call on him, or whether he
calls at the front halls of distinguished landowners, is
another matter. In any case he sings to the landowners’
tune, and his article has value only in that it gives one an
idea of what the landowners frankly say.

“If they are to be believed—and why shouldn’t they
be believed,” the landowners’ mouthpiece goes on, “the
Pugachov
movement[1] of 1905–06 has not at all ended.
It has subsided, it has assumed other, less boisterous forms,
but it continues its work of destruction. True, the peasants
no longer march, as they used to do, in great crowds, with
caravans of horse-drawn carts, to plunder and burn the
country estates of the landowners. But arson continues all the

    

same without cease: now it’s a house they set on fire, now
a threshing shed, now a hayloft, now a barn, now a stack
of corn or straw. The most outrageous, the most stupid
illegal cattle-grazing continues.... During the seven years
of our parliamentary era, no headway at all has been made
in the fight against village anarchy.”

Thus writes Menshikov in Novoye Vremya. The order
evidently was to prepare “public opinion” for fresh
measures of persecution and punishment of “hooligans”, to use
the expression current in the Black-Hundred and Octobrist
camp. But, in carrying out his orders, the landowners’
lackey blurts out the landowners’ true state of mind and
the true causes of their alarm.

Let us note and remember that the landowning gentry
intend to have new punitive laws and regulations to fight
the “Pugachov movement” of 1905–06, which has not at all
ended, but has assumed new forms.

Only one thing is somewhat strange. In 1905 and 1906,
the government and the Council of the United
Nobility[2]
assured themselves and others that the “Pugachov
movement” was the result of communal landownership and
the embryonic state of the institution of private property
in land among the peasantry. Now all the agents of the
government, all the government parties and newspapers
are dinning into our ears that the village commune has
collapsed and has been destroyed, and that the new system
of land tenure and the establishment of private property
in land among the peasantry have been a “tremendous”
success. If that were so, the “Pugachov movement”
allegedly caused by the village commune should surely have
stopped! And if it “has not at all ended”, as the landowners
assure us through Menshikov, their mouthpiece, it follows
that the village commune has nothing to do with it.
Consequently, the famous successes of the “new system of
land tenure” are a myth.

At any rate, the policy of which the landowners have
been boasting is a patent flop.

The general strike of the Belgian workers has ended, as
readers will know, in a
half-victory.[1] So far the workers
have secured only a promise by the clerical government
to appoint a commission to examine the question, not
only of the local but also of the national franchise. The
other day, the Belgian Prime Minister promised in the
Chamber of Deputies that the commission would be
appointed in May.

Of course, a ministerial promise (like any other promise
“from above”) is something that can by no means be taken
seriously. One could not even speak of a partial victory,
if the general political situation did not bear witness to
a certain breach made by the general strike in the old,
die-hard, unyielding and stubborn clerical (i.e.,
reactionary and obscurantist) “order”.

The achievement of the strike is not so much this
fragment of a victory over the government as the success of
the organisation, discipline, fighting spirit and
enthusiasm for the struggle displayed by the mass of the Belgian
working class. The working class of Belgium has proved
that it is capable of steadfast struggle at the call of its
Socialist Party. “We shall repeat the strike once again,
if necessary!” This was said by a workers’ leader during
the strike and is an expression of the fact that the masses
are aware of holding their weapons firmly in their hands,
and of being ready to make use of them once again. The
strike proved to the Belgian capitalists that it inflicts
vast losses on them, and that concessions are essential, if
Belgian capital is not to fall hopelessly behind German
capital, etc.
 

In Belgium, stable constitutional practices have long
since been established, and political liberty is an old
achievement of the people. Given political liberty, the
workers have a broad and open road before them.

Why, in that case, has the strike had such little success?
There are two main reasons.

The first is the domination of opportunism and
reformism in a section of the Belgian Socialists, especially those
in parliament. Being accustomed to move in alliance with
the Liberals, these members of parliament feel, themselves
dependent on the Liberals in all their activity. As a result,
there was hesitation in calling the strike, and hesitation
could not but limit the success, strength and scope of the
whole proletarian struggle.

The first lesson of the Belgian strike is: look less to the
Liberals, trust them less, and have more confidence in
the independent and whole-hearted struggle of the
proletariat.

The second cause of its partial failure is the weakness
of the workers’ organisations and the weakness of the
party in Belgium. The Workers’ Party in Belgium is an
alliance of politically organised workers with politically
unorganised workers, “pure and simple” co-operators,
trade unionists, etc. This is a big drawback of Belgium’s
labour movement, which Mr. Yegorov in Kievskaya Mysl
and the liquidators in Luch have done wrong to ignore.

The second lesson of the Belgian strike is: pay more
attention to socialist propaganda, work more to build up a
strong, highly principled and strictly party organisation
which is true to socialism.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The general strike took place in Belgium from April 14 to April 
24, 1913. The Belgian workers demanded a change in the
Constitution: universal and equal suffrage. The strike was on a massive
scale: of the total of more than one million, between 400,000
and 500,000 took part. Pravda gave wide coverage to the strike
and reported on donations by Russian workers to the strike fund.

Russia’s industrial boom over the last few years has
been accompanied by the usual rapid development of the
building industry. Vestnik
Finansov[1] recently carried
out a poll among the municipal authorities in 158 towns
of Russia on this question. Mr. Veselovsky in Russkoye
Slovo gives the following data from the poll: annual
construction and remodelling of houses:

in 1907 ............ 11,961

” 1908 ............13,709

” 1909 ............15,093

” 1910 ............10,674



In some three years, the building industry has expanded
nearly 50 per cent! That the capitalists are making vast
profits on this industrial boom can be seen from the prices
of bricks. The prices reach 33 rubles per thousand in
St. Petersburg, and 36 rubles in the more industrialised
Moscow.

Municipal brickworks exist in only 50 or 60 towns, so
that the possibility of combating the insatiable appetites
of the building capitalists is insignificant. And, for that
matter, our towns, as a result of the property franchise,
the complete absence of free elections, etc., have been
completely handed over to a handful of money-bags, who
take municipal interests to be those of their own pockets.

The series of notorious collapses of houses under
construction shows the incredibly scandalous practices in
building, the carelessness and the total disregard for
human life. Intensified building activity, with thousands
and thousands of rubles passing into the pockets of

    

contractors, engineers, capitalists, and the mass of sacrifices
offered up by the workers on the altar of capital—that
is what the industrial “boom” means.

And what of the position of the hundreds of thousands
of building workers?

We learn the following about their wages from the poll.
The day’s wage of a building worker varies with the size
of the town as follows:

Population

Day’s wage of a building worker

Under 5,000 . .

5,000–10,000 . .

10,000–25,000 . .

25,000–50,000 . .

50,000–75,000 . .

75,000–100,000 . .

100,000 and over . .

1 ruble 33 kopeks
1 ” 36 ”
1 ” 41 ”
1 ” 53 ”
1 ” 56 ”
1 ” 87 ”
1 ” 80 ”



Even in the biggest cities, the worker’s wage does not
reach 2 rubles a day! One can imagine what these workers
suffer with the present high cost of living, when very often
they have to maintain a family in another town or in the
country. Moreover, building work is seasonal, it does
not continue the year round. During the few months of
employment, the worker must earn enough to maintain
himself and his family throughout the year.

These figures are evidence of the workers’ poverty and
utter insecurity.

It is more difficult for building workers to unite and
get organised than for workers in factories. All the more
insistently should workers in the van campaign for the
education and organisation of building workers, who can
seek help nowhere but from their own workers’ paper, their
own workers’ trade union, and their own more developed
proletarian comrades.

What the Social-Democrats, representing the working
class, think of the Fourth Duma is well known. Their
assessment is based on the class character of the landowner
and landowner-bourgeois Duma, and also on the character
of the government which is trying to make some kind of
deal with the ruling classes in this Duma.

But it is instructive also to look at how this Duma is
assessed by the Right itself, and particularly by the
landowners.

In this respect, it is interesting to read an interview
carried by southern papers with Mr. Sinadino, mayor of
Kishinev, and a landowner who was a Nationalist in the
Third Duma, and in the Fourth is considered a member
of the “Centre” party, that is, to the right of the Octobrists.
There seems to be no point in looking around for a more
reliable pillar of the Establishment! And here is his
assessment:


“The Fourth Duma is a mere fiction. The men on the Council of
State have no consideration at all for the representatives of the people,
and act, we should say, against their will. I repeat, the Duma is a
mere fiction, and in such conditions can give the country nothing.
I can find no expression in Russian to describe the activities of the
Council of State. It is what the French call ‘sabotage’....”


This offended landowner is telling such truths about
the Duma and about our government that the workers,
ought to look at them closely. In general, as readers know,
the democrats have a chance to hear a truthful opinion
about the system and “order” of dominant reaction from the
reactionary gentlemen only when these reactionaries fall out.

One landowner (or several landowners) feels offended—

    

and you get such a description of the landowners’ “system”
of state administration and state structure that you might
think the description had been taken from a
Social-Democratic leaflet!

Both the Fourth and the Third Duma, Mr. Offended
Right-wing Landowner, are not fictions, because they
provide the government, for example, with approval for
its budget. But the point is that in spite of the whole
landowning class and all the top bourgeoisie helping the
government, it is not able to make any headway!

The possibility for an alliance between the government
and the landowners and the bourgeoisie has been created.
The Duma is doing all it can to bring about such an
alliance. And yet nothing even remotely resembling a
constitution has been produced. The old state system is still
there. The Ministers likewise are people who “tremble” (to
use Sinadino’s words) “for their own future”, evidently
not knowing what will happen to them tomorrow, what
their orders will be tomorrow.

All the “activity” of the Duma with the Council of
State, all the liberal wailing about the hopelessness of
reforms, even the most modest, the most Octobrist, the
most insignificant—and, finally, the frank admissions of
the offended landowner-“legislator”—all show that
constitutional illusions and reformist aspirations in
present-day Russia are quite groundless.

The cost of living is rising higher and higher.
Associations of capitalists are steadily raising prices, raking in
millions and tens of millions, while the mass of the
peasantry fall into greater and greater ruin and workers’
families find it ever more difficult to make both ends meet,
and have to go hungry and deny themselves the barest
necessities.

The organ of our industrial millionaires, Promyshlennost
i
Torgovlya,[1] gives the following data about the rising
cost of living. The so-called price index, which is obtained
by combining the prices of a specified number of major
foodstuffs, has been rising steadily over the past few years.
Here are the figures for April:

Year

Price Index

1908 ......... 2,195

1909 ......... 2,197

1910 ......... 2,416

1911 ......... 2,554

1912 ......... 2,693

1913 ......... 2,729



In the last six years, prices have risen from 2,195 to
2,729, i.e., by fully 24 per cent! There is remarkable
“progress” in the fleecing of the mass of the working
people, and particularly of the workers, by the capitalist
combines.

But the capitalists—both in the journal quoted and
in their innumerable societies and associations, graciously
authorised by the government—continue to complain of
the “unfair” taxation of trade and industry!
 

This would be funny, only the workers are not inclined
to laugh.

The poor and unfortunate industrial millionaires
publish the following data given in a ministerial document
on the taxation of urban real estate.

In 1910, the income from such property was assessed
at 239 million rubles (of course, it was assessed
bureaucratically, by officials, and one can imagine how many tens
of millions were concealed by the oh-so-poor merchant
class). In 1912, i.e., only two years later, the income on
urban real estate was assessed at 500 million rubles (
counting only Russia, without the Kingdom of Poland).

And so, in two years, the net income on urban real estate
rose by more than 250 million rubles! This gives an idea
of the stream of gold pouring into the pockets of the
capitalists, coming in millions of trickles from incredible
want, poverty and hunger among the peasants and workers.

“The high cost of living today” is nothing but the
present-day (capitalist) form of impoverishment, ruin and plunder
of the working people alongside the unprecedented
enrichment of a handful of capitalists.

Pity the poor capitalists who complain of patently
“unfair” taxation. Just think: they have to give up 6 per
cent of their net income. In 1910, they had to give up (in
Russia without Poland) 14 million rubles, and in 1912,
29.8 million rubles.

And so in two years the increase in tax on the robbed
millionaires amounted to nearly 16 million rubles.

What do you think, worker comrades: when net income
goes up from 240 to 500 millions, i.e., by 260 million rubles
in two years, should not a tax of a hundred or two hundred
million rubles have been collected? Should they not have
taken from the additional profit of 260 million rubles,
made on the workers and poor peasants, two hundred
millions, at a modest valuation, for schools and hospitals,
to aid the hungry and provide for workers’ insurance?

The Budget Commission of the German Reichstag has
passed the first reading of the Arms Bill. There is no doubt
that its adoption is assured. The government of the
Junkers—those brothers of our Purishkevich and Markov—is
“working” hand in hand with the German bourgeoisie on
new methods of oppressing the people, while increasing
the profits of the capitalist manufacturers of the weapons
of destruction. The manufacturers of war supplies and
equipment are doing good business. The young hopefuls
of the Prussian nobility are anticipating the pleasure of
getting “additional” appointments as officers. All the
ruling classes are satisfied—and what are modern parliaments
but instruments for doing the will of the ruling classes.

In order to justify the new armaments, there are the
usual efforts to paint a picture of the perils threatening
the “fatherland”. To scare the German philistine, the
German Chancellor has raised, among other things, the
bogey of the Slav peril. The Balkan victories, you see,
have strengthened “Slavdom”, which is hostile to the
whole “German world”! Pan-Slavism, the idea of uniting
all the Slavs against the Germans—there lies the peril,
the Junkers’ Chancellor assures them.

The German Social-Democrats have exposed, and continue
steadfastly to expose in their press, their parliamentary
speeches and at meetings, these hypocritical, chauvinist
outbursts. There is a state, the Social-Democrats have
said, the majority of whose population is Slav and which
has long enjoyed political liberty and constitutional order.
It is Austria. It is quite absurd to fear military designs
on the part of that state.
 

Pinned down by the Social-Democrats, the German
Chancellor referred to the noisy Pan-Slavist
manifestations in St. Petersburg. That’s a wonderful argument!
The manufacturers of guns, armour, gunpowder and
other “cultural” requirements wish to enrich themselves
both in Germany and in Russia, and in order to fool the
public each refers to the other. Russian chauvinists are
being used to scare the Germans, and German chauvinists,
the Russians! Both play a miserable role in the hands of
the capitalists, who know perfectly well that the very
idea of a war by Russia against Germany is ridiculous.


We repeat that the German chauvinists are assured of
a majority vote in the Reichstag. But among the German
workers there is growing indignation and demand for more
than purely parliamentary means of struggle against the
shameless plundering of the people’s money by the
chauvinists. It is interesting to note that a general meeting
of the Social-Democrats of the 1st Württemberg
constituency (Stuttgart) adopted the following resolution:


“This general meeting expresses its regret at the fact that the
struggle against the Arms Bill in parliament is not being waged with
sufficient vigour. The meeting considers that the furious drive into the
people’s pocket by the arms manufacturers should be resisted by all
possible means. This meeting, therefore, expects the Social–
Democratic group in the Reichstag to take up the struggle when the Bill
comes out of committee for discussion by the Reichstag as a whole,
in the most energetic fashion, without hesitating to adopt even
obstructionist tactics. The meeting considers insufficient the
extraparliamentary struggle the Party has carried on until now. This meeting
demands that the Party executive should begin organising action to
involve the whole working population, including mass strikes.”


There is slow but steady growth of awareness among
German Social-Democrats that more resolute, active, mass
struggle by the workers is necessary. If the opportunists,
of whom there are many in the parliamentary group and
among the officials of the labour movement, are opposed
to such a struggle, the masses of workers accept it with
greater and greater sympathy.

In backward states, where the mass of the people have
no rights, where there is no political liberty, where the
authorities have arbitrary powers, political organisations
on any broad scale are non-existent. Only tiny groups
of landowners or millionaire industrialists enjoy “the
right of association”; but they turn all their attention
to high quarters, to “the spheres”, to the authorities,
and not only shun but dread any massive organisation of
the people.

In states with assured constitutional foundations and
the people’s right to take part in government, it is not
only the socialists who strive to organise the masses (their
only strength lies in educating and organising the masses),
but also the reactionary parties. If the state system has
been made democratic, the capitalists must seek support
among the masses, and for this the latter must be organised
around the watchwords of clericalism (Black-Hundredism
and religion), of nationalism and chauvinism, etc.

Political liberty does not eliminate the class struggle
but, on the contrary, makes it broader and more conscious,
drawing into it the most backward sections of the people,
and teaching them politics and defence of their views and
interests.

It is instructive to see how, for example, the German
reactionary party of the “Centre”, i.e., the Catholics,
organises masses of the people. They strive to get the masses
to defend capitalism around the watchwords of religion
and “patriotism”. And the Catholics in Germany have
succeeded in playing up the people’s prejudices and

    

ignorance, partly owing to the fact that the Catholics in
Germany are a minority of the population, which at one time
was subjected to persecution by the state. And the masses
of toilers and exploited always instinctively tend to
sympathise with those who arc persecuted. The Catholic
reactionaries have made skilful use of this sentiment.

The Catholics have created a mass organisation, the
so-called People’s Union for Catholic Germany. The Union
has three-quarters of a million members. The organisation
is strictly centralised. Its aim is to safeguard the “
christian” (in practice, capitalist) system, and fight “
destructive” (i.e., socialist) tendencies.

The Union is headed by a 24–man board. Of them, 9
handle the board’s business correspondence, and the rest
are representatives of different regions, large cities, etc.
There is one “agent” for every 20–40 Catholic families.
All the agents act on instructions from the board.

The Catholics, when attacking the Social-Democrats,
usually accuse the Social-Democratic agitators of living
on the workers’ coppers. But in their own organisation
the Catholics themselves act in precisely the same way:
in every place of any importance they have paid agitators.

Work at the party executive is organised on strictly factory
lines. Twenty special officials are in charge of “literature”:
one handles theology, another, the agrarian question, a
third, the Social-Democratic movement, a fourth, the
artisans, etc. They make cuttings and extracts from
newspapers and journals, and keep a card index. They have
a staff of stenographers. A special library has 40,000
volumes. They draw up letters to the press—“reports”—
which are published by dozens of Catholic papers. Special
branches of this correspondence deal with “social and
political questions” and “apologetics” (i.e., defence of
religion and Christianity). Series of booklets are published
on all questions. As many as 5,000 sets of speakers’
notes on various subjects are sent out every year. A special
department deals with propaganda by films. An
information bureau answers queries of every kind free of charge:
in 1912 it answered over 18,000,000.

Catholic students are regularly recruited for
propaganda and agitation, particularly during vacations. The

    

agents (of whom there are several tens of thousands) attend
special “social courses”. There are special two-month
courses at the party executive for “training” to fight the
Social-Democrats. There are special fortnightly courses
for peasants, teachers, shop assistants, etc.

The reactionary German Catholics are rather well
organised. But all their work is a feeble imitation of the work
of the German Social-Democrats.

The metalworkers in Germany, as in other countries,
are in the van of class-conscious and organised proletarians.
They have raised the question, among other things, of
regular annual holidays for workers.

The manufacturers resist this measure with all their
strength, pleading the “heavy burden” of the cost involved.
But the German metalworkers, in a special pamphlet
published by their union, have given exact figures to refute
these selfish and hypocritical evasions. The workers have
proved that between 1905 and 1910 the net profit in 93
joint-stock companies in the German metallurgical industry
averaged 13.4 per cent!

It would be sufficient to reduce this profit by no more
than 2 per cent to give all workers regular holidays.

But at the present time the system of holidays is still
quite inadequately developed, and for the most part is
being applied by the capitalists to further indenture the
workers. The German metalworkers have taken two polls
on the question of holidays, in 1908 and 1912.

In 1908, workers had holidays at 138 factories. Of the
75,591 workers engaged in these factories, 13,579, i.e.,
17.9 per cent, had holidays.

In 1912, workers had holidays at 389 factories. Of the
233,927 workers employed there, 34,257, i.e., 14 per cent,
had holidays.

In all, only three factories in a thousand in the
metallurgical industry had a system of holidays! Of the total
number of metalworkers only 1.8 per cent, i.e., less than
one-fiftieth, had holidays.
 

Most factories allowing holidays—namely, more than
nine-tenths of them—grant holidays only to workers who
have been employed a fairly long time at the works. Of
the 389 factories (with 233,927 workers), 84 factories
employing 140,209 workers require a length of service from
five to ten years (!) before a worker gets the right to a
holiday.

Such holidays are obviously a ridiculously small
improvement for the workers, and are mainly a bait to keep
the workers in the factory and a means of combating
strikes!

In most cases (for 72 per cent of the workers in the
factories mentioned) the length of the holiday does not
exceed one week. For 10 per cent, the period is less than a
week, and only for 16 per cent is it more than a week (up
to two weeks).

In most factories allowing holidays (97 per cent),
workers going on holiday are paid their previous wages, or an
average weekly wage.

We find, therefore, that even in the leading industry
of an advanced country the system of holidays for workers
is disgracefully inadequate. But the workers are coining
to realise the need for regular and adequate rest and by
their insistence the organised workers will be able to achieve
success in this sphere too.

THE MEANING OF AN “HISTORIC” FORMULA

The press is still exercised over the adoption of the
so-called lack-of-confidence-in-the-government formula by the
Fourth Duma (on the Ministry of the Interior estimates),
by the votes of the Octobrists and the Cadets. Indeed,
the formula, like the comments on it in the liberal press,
deserves serious consideration. This has really raised
questions of principle: it is essential to return to them again
and again.

The leader-writer in Rech solemnly declared (No. 137)
that May 21, the day this formula was adopted, “will go
down as a date of historic significance”. Our liberals are
past masters at uttering loud and ringing phrases of this
kind; but the very first attempt at a serious analysis of the
meaning of the Duma’s decision betrays their astounding
shallowness and helplessness.

The liberals ignore the most fundamental and
indubitable facts which reveal the meaning of the Duma formula.

Firstly, of the parties which adopted the formula, neither
the Octobrists nor the
Progressists[1] (with whom the
Cadets are ire practice indissolubly tied up!) proposed rejection
of the estimates. The rejection of the estimates on the part
of the Cadets was only a theatrical gesture to catch the
democrats, since all knew perfectly well that the Cadets
would in practice support the Octobrists.

The “historic” formula is a phrase, since the majority
of the bourgeois parties did not even venture to use their
unquestionable “parliamentary” right to reject the budget.
And without the support of both the Octobrists and the
Progressists the Cadets are nil in the Duma and in the
country.

Secondly, what does the ideological and political 
content of the formula amount to? “We insist on the earliest

    

implementation of extensive reforms,” says the formula
adopted by the Octobrists. That is what the Progressists
also said. The same was demanded, in even stronger terms—
“radical reforms”!—by the “Centre” (i.e., the semi–
Octobrists and semi-nationalists). The same reformist attitude
is fully adopted by the Cadet formula: their wording is
somewhat sharper, but the ideas are exclusively reformist.

Thirdly, all the formulas, from that of the Cadets to
that of the Octobrists, give a clear expression of the 
reactionary standpoint.

In this respect, contrary to the lying assurances of Rech,
the Octobrist formula is not to the right but to the left
of the Progressist, and even of the Cadet, formulas. See
and judge for yourselves:


(1) The Progressists: (the Ministry) “is sowing in the country
the seeds of trouble, threatening the security of the state”;

(2) The Cadets: “such a situation is a serious threat to state and
public security”;

(3) The Octobrists: “the Ministry is destroying respect for the law
and the authorities among the people, thereby strengthening the mood
of opposition.”


Translated from the language of “official policy” into
ordinary human terms, this means one thing: the Cadets;
the Octobrists and the Progressists all promise to provide
better protection for the landowners, not as individuals
but as a class, of course, than the present system does.

Fourthly, all these three parties start from nationalism
and chauvinism. The Ministry, they allege, “weakens the
power of Russia” (say the Octobrists and the Progressists)
or “the external might of the state” (say the Cadets, even
more clearly!).

Such are the facts hushed up and distorted by the
liberals. The “historic” formula of the Fourth Duma is a
compact between the Cadets and the Octobrists, with the
help of the Progressists, on censuring the government and
expressing the wish for “radical reforms”, provided the
budget is voted and the standpoint of reactionary
nationalism and chauvinism is clearly expressed.

At first, it was a group in the Third Duma consisting of deputies
from the bourgeois and landowner parties of Peaceful Renovation
and Democratic Reform. It became a party in November 1912.

Our liberal press has taken the notorious Fourth Duma
formula on the Ministry of the Interior estimates to mean
that “the government is acting in something of a vacuum....
The government has no friends in the country with the
exception of the subsidised newspapers, and the handfuls
of politicians who are also subsidised and are loyal only
so long as the subsidy lasts.”

That is the opinion of the “serious”, professorial Russkiye
Vedomosti, and that’s no joke!

“The government is completely isolated, and finds no
support even in the political groups it set up itself.” That
is the opinion of Rech.

It would probably be hard to match the puerility
displayed in these observations by the professors, lawyers,
writers and deputies of the liberal camp. Theirs is a truly
incurable parliamentary cretinism, in a country where
“there is, thank God, no
parliament”![1]

In a vacuum, you say?

But haven’t you heard, Messrs, professors and deputies,
of the Council of the United Nobility, and of its support
of the government’s policy; of the hundred million or so
of dessiatines of the best land in the best parts of Russia
belonging to the landowning class; of all the key civil and
military posts held by the same class; of the sugar and
other finance barons among the same class?

You haven’t heard of all that? Oh, ye wise statesmen of
liberalism!

The government, you say, is completely isolated, it has
no friends in the country?

But what are you there for, gentlemen? Wasn’t it you,
together with the Progressists and the Octobrists, who voted
the estimates of the Ministry of the Interior?
 

Imagine the existence of millionaire acquaintances who
easily give you as much money as you want, while
expressing “wishes” which are not binding on anybody. Don’t you
think, gentlemen, that we should be entitled to call these
millionaires our friends, and that we should not feel
ourselves “isolated” (among the millionaires)?

But by your formula you have extended to the
government not only material but also great ideological support.
This is very important, and you must not think that we shall
allow you to dodge this ticklish question before the public.


What was the argument about in the Duma? To vote the
funds, but to express a wish for—the reform of the police
and for “normal limits of the legal system”, said the
nationalists. To vote the funds, but to express a desire for
radical or broad reforms, said the Octobrists, adding that
their unequivocal stand is counter-revolutionary
nationalism and chauvinism.

And now all the liberals perform this trick: they keep
silent about the addition, but express delight over the
demand for “radical reforms”! All that is lacking is an
addendum to their list, on the suggestion of some clever
liquidator, on “freedom of association and review of
agrarian legislation”....

The feudal landowners are backing the old system. The
bourgeoisie is in favour of reform. By its “formula” it
inflicted a moral blow on the government. But at the same
time that bourgeoisie gave moral support to the
government by emphasising its counter-revolutionary attitude!
And such support is a hundred times more effective and
weighty than dozens of “moral” blows.

The “historic” Duma formula provides fresh
confirmation that the June Third
system[2] has entered a blind
alley. And the bourgeoisie, maintaining the position
described, cannot get out of that blind alley. The experience
of history teaches us that the bourgeoisie may daydream
about reforms, stagnate in a blind alley and bear the yoke
of the Purishkeviches for decades, unless the crisis is
resolved the way the liberals dread and hope to exorcise.

the Second Duma and issued a new electoral law which greatly
increased the representation of the landowners and the
commercial and industrial bourgeoisie and sharply reduced the number
of peasants’, workers’ and non-Russian deputies. It assured the

   

reactionary bloc of landowners and big capitalists of complete
domination of the Third and Fourth Dumas. The June 3 coup
ushered in the period of Stolypin reaction known as the June Third

This paper has already reported the remarkable act of
spinelessness on the part of Gustavo Herve. This smart
journalist and agitator, a man without socialist training
or socialist education, went over (from the ranks of the
professors) to the workers’ party, with all the habits and
practices of a bourgeois intellectual. He began as an
opportunist. Then he swung over to the “extreme Left”, and
for a long time preached semi-anarchist ideas, “terrifying”
the bourgeoisie with noisy outcries in an anti-militarist
spirit.

Lately he has tended to turn away from the anarchists
and to make his way back to the party, and towards
recognition of the parliamentary struggle and of educational
and organisational work. But there again, this intellectual
smarty wobbled, and swung back to the opportunists. Being
an impressionist, too much swayed by the last impression
and prone to spineless vacillation, he has been so “scared”
by the present reactionary wave of chauvinism,
nationalism and imperialism in France that he has begun
preaching a return to the “bloc” policy, i.e., an alliance with the
bourgeois Radicals. In order to save the Republic in France
it is essential, he asserts, to have a bloc with the Radicals;
otherwise the reactionaries in France will once again
restore the monarchy or the Empire!

It is hardly necessary to say that, apart from extreme
opportunists, the French Socialists ridicule the spineless
Herve, and energetically protest against the bloc. Recently
one of the organs of the workers’ party published in the

    

South of France carried a number of statements by leading
Socialists against the bloc.

It is the Socialists who began and are carrying on the
campaign against reaction, these leading workers rightly
say; it is the Socialists who campaigned among the masses
with their protest against the law for a return to three
years’ military service (i.e., a return to the reactionary,
barrack-room and absolutely undemocratic army). It is
the Socialists who are working for a proletarian bloc, i.e.,
the alliance of socialist workers and syndicalist
workers. Among the Radicals and “Radical-Socialists” (a
petty-bourgeois party resembling our Narodniks) only a tiny
section supports this truly democratic campaign of the
Socialists, and then with many waverings.

Why then have a bloc? Alliance with those who waver
will weaken the pressure of the masses and increase the
vacillation! Meanwhile, the Socialists have never refused
to support the Radicals to the extent that they oppose the
reactionaries.

Here, for example, are Messrs. Charles Dumont and
Alfred Masse, true-blue “Radical-Socialists”, writes one
Socialist, who are backing the three-year service law in the
expectation of securing a ministerial post. Here is
Clemenceau “himself”, the leader of the Radicals, carrying on
a campaign for this law. Here is another prominent leader
of the Radicals, Leon Bourgeois, who has also declared
in favour of the law. Lastly, in the Military Commission
of the Chamber of Deputies, the law was adopted by 17
votes to 4, the latter exclusively socialist.

How can there be a bloc, then, with this shameless
bourgeois party of Radicals and “Radical-Socialists”? Only
by agitating against it among the masses can the French
Socialists detach all democratic elements from that party,
thereby obliging some part of it to go left, towards
democracy. Being completely dependent on the masses at the
elections (since France, of course, has universal suffrage
and parliamentary government), many Radicals will think
again and again before finally voting for a reactionary law
well known to be unpopular among the masses.

The only serious support for democracy and the Republic
in France (as everywhere else) is the masses, the masses

    

of workers and with them also the small peasants, and not
the parliamentary politicians, buffoons, careerists and
adventurers of the bourgeois parties, who declare themselves
“Radical-Socialists” one day, only to sell out democracy
and country the next day (for the sake of some ministerial
job or profitable deal, in the form of some concession or
post in a millionaire syndicate, etc.)—(as the French
bourgeois sold France to Bismarck in 1871, out of fear of the
Paris workers’ uprising against wage-slavery).

The French Socialists, who are fighting the idea of a
bloc and are extending their socialist work and agitation
among the masses, deserve the warmest greetings.

The speech of the well-known Baden Social-Democrat
Frank, a most prominent representative of the opportunist
wing, in favour of the mass strike as a means of struggle
for electoral reform in Prussia, is something of an event
in the German Socialist Party.

The Social-Democratic Party organisation in
Wilmersdorf, a suburb of Berlin, invited Frank to give a lecture on
the subject. The bourgeois press, expecting peaceable and
tranquillising words to come “out of Baden”, loudly
advertised the meeting. The free publicity was magnificent.
The meeting turned out to be a huge and most impressive one.

But whether because he was addressing the militant
Berlin workers or because as a southerner, accustomed to
the freer atmosphere of Southern Germany, he was outraged
at the shameless domination of the “Junkers” (the German
Black-Hundred gentry) whom he saw at closer quarters in
Berlin, Frank made a fiery speech in favour of the mass
strike.

The speaker began by outlining internal politics in
Prussia. Frank castigated the domination of the Junkers, the
reactionary electoral law for the Prussian Landtag (a law
rather like our own Third Duma law) and the absence of
elementary democratic guarantees. When he noted that
under the Prussian electoral law the keeper of a brothel
had first-class electoral rights, and the Prime Minister,
only third-class rights, and that this was characteristic
of the Prussian “way of life”, the audience roared with
laughter in approval of his assessment.

The Berlin workers—Frank said with a smile—have
proved by their struggle against Jagow (the mayor who

    

vainly tried to prohibit demonstrations in 1910) that they
have talents in the sphere of street manoeuvres.

The speaker recalled the examples of mass strikes in
history: by the Chartists in England; the Belgians in 1893,
1902 and 1912; the Swedes in 1903; the Italians in 1904,
and the Russians in 1905; he dwelt in greater detail on the
last example, stressing the help which the Russian workers
then gave their neighbours and brothers, the Austrian
workers. The mere threat of a political strike then proved
sufficient to win adult suffrage for the Austrians.

In Prussia and in Germany, exclaimed Frank, we have
the best labour movement in the world and the most
extensive working-class press. Let us then learn mass struggle
from the proletariat of the whole world! (Enthusiastic
approval and applause of the audience.)

Naturally, this new form of struggle involves sacrifice
and danger, Frank continued; but when have political
battles not entailed danger and sacrifice? Once we have
realised the necessity of struggle, we must carry it on to
the end, we must pilot our ship forward despite the
possible reefs ahead. Those who fear them and remain in port
will certainly be safe, but they will never get to the other
shore—the objective for which we are striving.

Enthusiastically received by the meeting, Frank’s speech
showed once again the great indignation the reactionaries
have aroused in the German workers. A mighty protest is
maturing in the German proletariat slowly but surely.

An interesting congress opened at Kharkov yesterday,
June 12. It is interesting in two respects. For one thing,
it is the first general Zemstvo congress on the statistics
of public education. And then it has been honoured by
particular attention on the part of the authorities. The
chairman of the congress has been appointed by the
authorities, and the specialists have been “screened”, as B. 
Veselovsky puts it in Russkoye Slovo, also by the authorities.
No representatives of the press have been allowed to attend
the congress.

These measures—which even from the “Russian” point of
view seem to be unduly, let us say, prudent—can hardly
be explained by the fact that the congress meets in one of
the Ukrainian centres. This Zemstvo congress will be
attended not only by Ukrainian statisticians and Zemstvo
officials,[1] but also by men in this field who come from
all the nationalities of Russia.

The subject of the congress is apparently not to the liking
of the authorities, although the only item on the agenda
will be the organisation of statistics, what has been done,
why too little has been done, while more should be done,
and better.

Public education lags more in Russia than anywhere
else in the world. Duma deputy Badayev pointed out in his
speech that even among the American Negroes there are
only 44 per cent illiterates—in Europe it is 1 or 2 per cent—
whereas in Russia 79 per cent are illiterate!

However, despite a thousand obstacles, public education
has lately been growing and developing faster than before.
To know the truth about the state of education is the direct

    

and most vital interest of the masses of the people in
general, and the workers in particular.

It would not be at all difficult to organise the public
education statistics on European lines. Every teacher could
easily report every year the required information about
every pupil (age, nationality, family conditions, economic
condition of parents, etc.) and about every teacher (
education, salary, working day, nationality and so forth). A
small number of statisticians, annually processing such
data, could provide the state with most abundant and
valuable material, both on the conditions in which the
young generation is being brought up and educated, and
on a number of aspects of popular life, ... if ... if .... But
representatives of the press have not been admitted to the
Kharkov congress, its chairman has been appointed, its
specialists, as B. Veselovsky tells us in Russkoye Slovo,
have been screened by the authorities.

I’m afraid we’ve been a trifle silly with this talk of
European-style statistics of education. Europe is something we
can only dream of! We would do well to keep silent.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Zemstvos were local self-government bodies dominated by
landed nobility in the central gubernias of tsarist Russia, first
set up in 1864. They had jurisdiction only of local economic
matters (hospitals, roads, statistics, insurance, etc.) and were under
the Governor and the Ministry of the Interior, which could revoke
any undesirable decisions.

Dear Comrade,

I have received and read your article. I think the
subject was well chosen and has been correctly elaborated,
but the article will need some polishing up. There is far
too much—how shall I put it?—-“agitation”, which is out
of place in an article on a theoretical subject. Either you
yourself, I think, ought to work it over, or we could do it.

Many thanks for your news of Kostrov. Please ask Avel
to write and inform us more frequently. This is important,
because we know nothing.

Could you obtain and translate Kostrov’s Georgian
articles
(a) against the liquidators,
(b) on the national question,
for cultural-national autonomy,
(c) the most important,
against Plekhanov’s preface to
Arkomed,[1] against
Plekhanov’s defence of hegemony?

I am going away to Berne for a few weeks. On my return,
I hope, we shall discuss things again in our letters.

Best wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Thanks for the issue of
Pravda.[2]

Dear Georgi,

I don’t know anything about the
conference.[3] Decide
for yourselves.

N. K.’s treatment is dragging out, and I shall be staying
here another fortnight, or maybe longer. I don’t know
exactly.

The Ukrainian’s article is very
good.[4] The main thing
is that he is a centralist. This is so rare and so valuable
in our rotten times that you and
Yuri[5] must without
fail get to know him closer, get to know the man.

The article requires not so much corrections of style
(that’s nothing) as explanations by the author. He must
write one more article. I am writing about this on the next
page[1]

;

you and Yuri read it, and decide for yourselves
whether to let the Ukrainian read it, or whether it is better
for you to tell him what it says.

Beste
Grüsse,[2]

Dear Comrade,

I very much enjoyed your article, as the article of a
centralist fighting the Dontsovs and Co. It is extremely
important to fight nationalists of this brand (and the
Ukrainian Social-Democrats), who are more subtle!

I will insist that the editorial board of Pravda insert
your article. But in my view the readers—40,000 Russian
(and for the most part Great-Russian) workers—will not
understand it.

My advice, if you don’t mind my giving it, is that you
should write one more article, which is to go in first. An
introduction, a brief general sketch of the question of “
centralism” and “separatism” (you have chosen the terms
very well and correctly) among Social-Democrats of the
Ukraine. Give the reader an introduction to the question.
Describe the general trends, what they are and what their
history is (briefly).

Then there is one more question: Basok, it is said, has
turned towards nationalism and separatism. That’s what
I have heard; is it true? Could you get me his “famous”
article (1910 or 1911 or 1912) with the turn in
question?[1]
Then recently, they say, someone or other “united” at
a conference in Lvov: the
Spilka[2] group with the
Ukrainian Social-Democrats, or with the Dontsovs? I was
promised the joint resolutions from Lvov, but haven’t had
them yet. What do you know about
this?[3] Should not a
couple of lines be added to say that even among the Spilka
group there are some who are, unfortunately, sliding down
to nationalism and separatism?

Greetings and best wishes,
 N. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Basok-Melenevsky (M. M.)—a member of the Ukrainian
Social-Democratic organisation, Spilka (Union). His nationalism was
fully revealed during the war. The article by Basok referred to
has not been identified.





[2]
Spilka—the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Union, an organisation
close to the Mensheviks. It was formed in late 1904 after its
breakaway from the petty-bourgeois, nationalist Revolutionary
Ukrainian Party, and dissolved during the period of reaction. For a
number of years only small Spilka groups continued to exist.





[3]
The Second All-Ukraine Student Congress, held in Lvov on June
19–22 (July 2–5), 1913, was timed for the celebration of an
anniversary of Ivan Franko, the great Ukrainian revolutionary
democrat, writer, scholar and public figure. Representatives of
Ukrainian students from Russia also attended. The Congress
heard a report, “Ukrainian Youth and the Present Condition of the
Nation”, by the Ukrainian Social-Democrat Dontsov, who

   

propounded the “independence” of the Ukraine, a slogan backed by
the National Democrats but opposed by a group of Ukrainian
Social-Democrats who had emigrated from Russia. However, the protest
was not supported by the Congress and following the debate it
adopted Dontsov’s resolution setting forth the programme of the
Ukrainian separatists.

Dear Comrade,

If you happen to be in Jena, be sure to make the
acquaintance of our representative (send him a letter postlagernd
Herrn Bekzadian, Jena—if you do not manage to meet
him
otherwise).[1] Have a talk with him about all our
affairs. He should be given the facts against
Tyszka.[2]

Greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Acquaint him with Pannekoek, Mehring and others of
the Left, if he does not get to know them himself. Drop
me a line whether you are going to Jena (when you have
quite decided on this).

Absender: Ulianow. Poronin.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A. Bekzadian was the R.S.D.L.P. representative at the German
Social-Democratic Party Congress held in Jena from September 
14 to 20, 1913.





[2]
The Bolsheviks wanted to take the opportunity of the German
Social-Democratic Party Congress in Jena so as to settle the affair
of the trustees’ money. The affair dragged on, because L. Tyszka
and Rosa Luxemburg, who sympathised with the conciliators,
used their influence with the trustees—Clara Zetkin, K. Kautsky
and F. Mehring—to prevent the return of the money to the
Bolsheviks.

October 28, 1913

Cracow, Ul. Lubomirskiego. 51

Dear Comrade,

I quite understand your indignation against the
scoundrels in the so-called Chief Executive, but would advise
the
commission[3] first of all, nevertheless, to secure
a formal refusal from the Chief Executive. You can after
all secure this (the address of Rosa Luxemburg, as a member
of the International Socialist Bureau, etc.), for without
it the I.S.B. will probably not interfere, and inclusion of
the question will be rejected on formal grounds. You should
not improve the position of Tyszka and Co. by any step on
your part which may call forth an I.S.B. refusal of your
request.

I advise you to write a careful information letter on
behalf of the commission to Huysmans (mainly pressing the
point that the Zarzad
Glówny[1]

refuses to have its “
judgement” reviewed by a panel of I.S.B. affiliated parties
active in Russia) asking him to help you to bring moral
pressure to bear on the Chief Executive. This would be
better than a premature formal appeal, entailing the risk
of failure.

I hope you will inform me, if Plekhanov replies to you.

With Social-Democratic greetings,
 N. Lenin

Ulianow. Ul. Lubomirskiego. 51. Krakow.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Chief Executive.—Ed.
 



[2]
V. L. Leder—a Polish Social-Democrat (a “Rozlamist”) who
supported the Left wing of the Social-Democratic Party of Poland
and Lithuania.





[3]
The Commission to review the decision of the trial of Karl Radek
on charges of unethical behaviour was set up by the Chief
Executive of the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and
Lithuania; under a decision of the court, Radek was expelled from the
party and from the German Social-Democratic Party.

The Commission was set-up in Paris in early September 1913
on the initiative of the bureau of the sections abroad of the
Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania (Rozlamists).

The Commission worked for five months and arrived at the
conclusion that there was no ground for the party trial of Radek
and his dismissal from the party.

Lenin sided with the opposition (Rozlamists) and believed
that the charges sprang from the acute struggle which the Chief
Executive waged against the opposition, and were
motivated by factional considerations. He supported the review of the
Radek case.

For details on the differences between the Chief Executive and
the opposition, see present edition, Vol. 19, Note 135.

Dear Alexei Maximych,

I am sending you today by registered book-post the
beginning of a novel which is to go into Prosveshcheniye. We
think that you will not object. But if, by any chance, you
should, cable to Prosveshcheniye: “Postpone Voitinsky” or
“Don’t carry Voitinsky’s
novel”.[1]

The news that you are being given a new kind of treatment
by “a Bolshevik”, even if a former one, has really worried
me. The saints preserve us from comrade-doctors in general,
and Bolshevik-doctors in particular! Really and truly, in
99 cases out of 100 the comrade-doctors are “asses”, as a
good doctor once said to me. I assure you that you should
consult (except on minor complaints) only first-class men.
It is terrible to try out on yourself the inventions of a
Bolshevik! The only reassuring thing is the supervision of
professors in Naples, if these professors really know their
business.... You know, if you do go in winter, in any case
call on some first-class doctors in Switzerland and in
Vienna—there will be no excuse for not doing so! How do
you feel now?

Yours,
 N. Lenin

P.S. Over here things are not at all bad; in St. Petersburg,
the workers are organising on party lines in all the legal
societies, including the sick benefit societies. There were
some interesting and practical lads here, too.

My address: Wl. Ulianow. Ulica Lubomirskiego. 51.
Kraków. Krakau (Galizien).
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
An extract from V. Voitinsky’s novel The Waves, entitled “A
Ray of Light in the Night”, was published in Prosveshcheniye
No. 4, 1914. But Lenin’s letter of mid-November 1913 to A. M.
Gorky (see p. 266 of this volume) shows that Gorky was against the
publication of Voitinsky’s novel in Prosveshcheniye. That is why
it is not quite clear whether the reference is to The Waves or to
another of Voitinsky’s manuscripts.

Dear A. M.,

I have received the
novel[1] and your letter. My opinion
is that the novel should be shelved, since you are not in
favour. I enclose a letter from Kamenev, who read the
novel (I have not read it yet).

We shall write to St. Petersburg to have them hold it
up.

I enclose my letter of
yesterday[2]: don’t be angry that
I lost my temper. Perhaps I did not understand you aright?
Perhaps it was as a joke that you wrote “for a time”?
Perhaps you weren’t serious about God-building, either?

I entreat you to get the best possible treatment.

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade,

We were very willingly preparing to publish your article
on Struve’s
book.[2] But in a second reading we realised
that the passage about the serf economy would inevitably
be understood in Party circles as advice to delete the
confiscation of landed estates in the Programme. This needs
discussing. Why not throw out the passage for the time
being? We thought you did not want to start a discussion
just at present.

If we are wrong, and you did want to start a discussion,
drop us a line: if you insist, we shall carry the
article....[1]

February 9, 1914

Dear Colleagues,

I have received a letter from the secretary about the
unfortunate article which has put the newspaper in
peril.[1] It’s a great pity that publicity was given (was
it a board decision?) to this unfortunate article in which
they contrived to find evidence of ties between the
papers....

Having only just come home after a journey “on matters
of
business”,[2] I looked through all the published issues
and have failed to find two articles which I sent (about a
month ago!) in reply to F. D. on the subject of unity “(The
Liquidators’ Leader on the Liquidators’ Terms of Unity”
is the title of the first of these
articles).[3] The articles
are absolutely essential, especially in view of the new
journal
Borba,[4] and it is necessary to publish them
before it comes out. Yet the articles have not been
published, and (as though making a mockery of any
collective work) you haven’t written me a single line for a
whole month about their fate! ((If they are too long,
which however is improbable, I would have sent them to
Prosveshcheniye.))

Really, I quite fail to understand this way of doing
business! How can you treat contributors—and colleagues—in
this manner?

Please, reply!

With greetings,
 V. I.
 

P.S. Please send me


Proletarskaya Pravda No. 11 (29)


Put Pravdy
No. 2[5]

Novaya Rabochaya Gazeta No. 8 (126).

P.S. Do you happen to have a file of the journal
Mysl,[6]
or any separate issues? Please, send them over.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The secretary of the Pravda editorial board, K. N. Samoilova,
informed the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. in her letter of January 25 (
February 7), 1914, of the closure of the newspaper Proletarskaya Pravda
(Proletarian Truth), and the possible closure of Put Pravdy (Path
of Truth). Her fear arose from the fact that as a result of the
publication, in Put Pravdy of January 23, 1914, of the article “That Is
Why It Exists...” under the signature of “M. F.” (M. Firin,
subsequently exposed as the provocateur M. Y. Chernomazov) which
revealed the continuity between the various names of Pravda
(Truth), Rabochaya Pravda (Workers’ Truth), Severnaya Pravda
(Northern Truth), Pravda Truda (Labour Truth), etc., Petrovsky
was prosecuted.





[2]
Lenin’s trip to Paris, Brussels, Liege and Leipzig in January and
early February 1914 in connection with the work of the Fourth
Congress of the Social-Democratic Party of the Latvian Region,
and his lectures on the national question.





[3]
See present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 95–98.





[4]
Borba (Struggle)—a journal published by Trotsky, seven issues of
which appeared in St. Petersburg from February 22 (March 7)
to July 1914. Trotskyites, liquidators and members of the Vperyod
group contributed to the magazine, which under the cover of
Trotsky’s “non-factionalism” fought Lenin and the Bolshevik
Party.





[5]
The Bolshevik Pravda was issued under the name of Proletarskaya
Pravda (Proletarian Truth) from December 7 (20), 1913 to
January 22 (February 4), 1914, and under the name of Put Pravdy
(Path of Truth) from January 22 (February 4) to May 21 (June 3).





[6]
Mysl (Thought)—a Bolshevik legal philosophical and socio–
economic journal published in Moscow from December 1910 to
April 1911. It was started by Lenin to offset and fight the
liquidators’ magazines.

Dear Alexander Antonovich,

Many thanks for your news from Vienna: it’s very
interesting. Trotsky’s venture is of great
importance[1]; the
break-up of the August
bloc[2] is complete (the Letts have
withdrawn from the Organising
Committee!).[3]

Grigory says that you have continued 

(1) the statistics of collections (by workers’ groups)
after October 1, 1913 (up to January 1,
1914)[4];

(2) the statistics of voting for the Seven and for the Six
(also at least up to January 1, 1914, or February 1,
1914).[5]

Please complete this work as soon as you can, and send
it over immediately: it will go into the pamphlet we are
sending out
shortly.[6]

Hurry!

I have received No. 1 of Prosveshcheniye. Not bad. There
was no point only in having the review of Levitsky with
the silly word
“factionalism”.[7]

And what is your opinion of the issue?

Greetings to Yelena Fyodorovna.

Also to Bukharin.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Trotsky’s publication of his anti-Party, factional journal Borba.





[2]
The anti-Party August bloc was set up by Trotsky in 1912 at a
liquidators’ conference in Vienna, which was attended by

   

Bundists, members of the Transcaucasian Regional Committee, the
Social-Democratic Party of the Latvian Region and various
groups of liquidators, Trotskyites, and otzovists abroad.

The bloc, made up of various anti-Party elements, soon fell
apart under Bolshevik pressure for the illegal proletarian party.




[3]
The question of the break between the Lettish Social-Democrats
and the Menshevik Organising Committee was decided at the
Fourth Congress of the Social-Democratic Party of the Latvian
Region held from January 26 to February 8, 1914 (see present
edition, Vol. 20, pp. 360–62).





[4]
The statistical data on cash collections for Pravda and Luch,
mentioned by Lenin, are given in his article “The Working Class
and Its Press” (see present edition, Vol. 20, pp. 363–79).





[5]
Workers’ votes cast for both Social-Democratic groups in the
Duma: the Bolshevik Six and the Menshevik Seven (see table
in Lenin’s article, “How the Workers Responded to the
Formation of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Group in
the Duma”, =

present edition, Vol. 20, p. 538).





[6]
The pamphlet, From the History of the Workers’ Press in Russia,
was issued as No. 1 of the newspaper Rabochy on April 22, 1914.
The whole issue was devoted to the history of the working-class
press in Russia.





[7]
A review by V. Yan-sky (S. S. Danilov) of V. Levitsky’s book
August Bebel. His Life and Work, which said: “Levitsky tries to
draw the reader’s attention specifically to Bebel’s attitude to
‘compromises’, and compacts with the liberals, in an effort to
set Bebel up as a model for someone.... Levitsky’s exposition
is not free from factionalism, and presents the great German
leader and his views in the wrong light.”

Cracow, February 27, 1914

Dear Colleague,

I have long since received your book, Immigration and
Labour,[1] and have been looking for your address to send
you my thanks. But it proved far from easy to find your
address. I got it only today, and hasten to express my
gratitude to you for sending me the book. I have already
written an
article[2] about it, and on the basis of it, in our
St. Petersburg Social-Democratic newspaper Pravda, and
intend to write again. I believe that this work provides a
mass of valuable material for the study of capitalism, being
at the same time something of an application of the best
methods of our Zemstvo statisticians on Western soil.

The comrade who sent me your address (Mr. John Ellert)
has written to tell me that you could use your influence
to help obtain all kinds of material from the Bureau of
the Census in Washington. May I, therefore, ask you to do
me a favour, provided of course that this will not give
you too much trouble or interfere with your work.

When I made a study of American agricultural
statistics (Vol. V. Agriculture—Census of 1900) in Paris,
I found
a great deal of interesting matter. Now, in Cracow, I am
unable to obtain these publications. Cahan, editor of the
Jewish socialist paper in New
York,[3] who was over here
a year ago, promised to have them sent, but has apparently
forgotten to do so.

They say that when requested by the right people the
American Bureau of the Census will send its publications
free of charge even to foreign countries. If that is so, could

    

you put in a word? (I could send the Bureau of the Census
library my books, The Development of Capitalism in
Russia and the Agrarian
Question.[4]) What I need most is
Agriculture, Vol. V, Census of 1900, and the same volume
of the Census of 1910 (if that is not yet out, then the
bulletins).

If that is impossible, would you be so kind as to send a
postcard to Mr. John Ellert (c/o Novy
Mir.[5] 140. East
4th Street, New York)—I shall send him the money to
buy the things I need most.

I thank you once again for the book, and hope you will
pardon the trouble.

With Social-Democratic greetings,
 N. Lenin (V. Ulyanov)

Address: Wl. Uljanow. 51. Ulica Lubomirskiego. Krakau

Dear Colleagues,

I welcome your paper in every way, and particularly
its obvious improvement. At last the literary side is
beginning to be well organised! The next job is the business side.
You must not leave the question of subscribers “
unpublished” either: you should announce their number,
otherwise you cannot rise from the small circle level to
full-scale organisation, from a private enterprise to a collective
one.

Nor can I pass over an obvious mistake in No. 22, where
side by side with the correct resolution from the Vyborg
workers (on Buryanov) you have, without comment from
the editors, a longer and disgustingly double-faced
resolution from the Zurich
group.[2] Pravda’s word is law; its
silence tends to confuse the workers; its abstention sows
bewilderment.

With Buryanov one must be “as wise as a serpent”,
but the editorial board has departed from such wisdom.
We praise him only for leaving the liquidators, and not
at all for lone-wolf “independence”. In this the liquidators
are right, and there is no greater danger for a politician in
the struggle than to take up the wrong position.

Yet the Zurich group support Buryanov in his erroneous,
false, double-faced position! And we give them a platform—
what for? Knowing that the Zurich group are a minority
abroad! Knowing that we cannot make all the groups
abroad express their stand in Pravda!

Buryanov should be made to understand and feel the
falseness of his attitude. You have left the liquidators?
Good.
 

You have proposed equality? Good.

What then? It is time to make a choice. We will not
support you in double-dealing (the pendulum game). The
liquidators are attacking you as an “independent
Social-Democrat”: they are right, and we shall not defend you.
Here is a reasonable period for you, here is assistance
during that period (tacit, with speeches, etc.), but no more
than that. Either you make your choice (within 2 or 4
weeks)—or you get no more help.

That is the only way to act. Otherwise in the immediate
future (both at the Vienna Congress and
earlier[3])
Buryanov’s stand will do us harm, and people will be justified
in telling us that we are supporting an “independent”.

The editorial board must find an occasion to say
(1) that
the Vyborg workers are right, not the Zurich group;
(2)
that, apart from a section of those abroad (Zurich), no one
in Russia has approved or will approve “independence”.

This must be done.

All the best, and wishing the paper every kind of
improvement and success!

V. I.

P.S. Within a month, Buryanov will say: the Zurich
group supported me, and only the workers of Vyborg
condemned me! And we shall not have had general mass
support for the Vyborg group. But that is just what we need
most now.

If you “give Buryanov a free hand” and your support,
he will consolidate his position against us, and that would
be a crime against the will of the majority of the workers
and against the “Marxist whole”.

P.S. Could you please send No. 2 of Nasha Zarya as
quickly as possible, when it comes out, for a reply to L. 
Martov in Prosveshcheniye?

P.P.S. Please show this letter to the paper’s contributors
who are in the R.S.D.L. Duma group.

Can you send me Milyukov’s article in Russkiye
Vedomosti where he speaks about the tactics of refusing to
believe in a peaceable outcome?

The lost book has been found. Insist on non-abridgement.
 

About the paper, I repeat that the improvement is
tremendous. (The same comments from everywhere.) All the
best. Laissez-nous écrire plus souvent l’opinion et les
directives (les commandes même) du
rédacteur![1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
Have them inform us more frequently of the editor’s opinion
and directives (nay, his orders)!—Ed.
 



[2]
The resolution of a group of workers in the Vyborg district, “On
the Withdrawal of Comrade Buryanov from the Seven”, and the
“Open Letter to A. F. Buryanov”, signed by the Zurich group
for the promotion of the R.S.D.L.P.

In their resolution the Vyborg workers welcomed Buryanov’s
withdrawal from the Seven, as fresh evidence of its political
bankruptcy, but censured his neutralist stand as being incorrect.
The Zurich group, mostly Mensheviks, assessed this as a major
step towards the unification of the two Social-Democratic groups
in the Duma. The two documents appeared in Put Pravdy No. 22,
February 26, 1914.

A congress of the Second International set for Vienna in 1914 and
a congress of the R.S.D.L.P. then being prepared. Neither took
place because of the outbreak of the war.

I would ask the editorial board to let me know whether
my second
article[1] is being published. It ought to be.
If there is no room, drop me a line. Otherwise I cannot
write the continuation.

I ask you particularly not to be late (as you were with
No. 2 of Borba) in sending me Yedinstvo: the “pro-Party
Bolsheviks”[2] on it should, in my opinion, be held up
as a laughing-stock, with the straightforward statement
that they are zeros, who have never had a single coherent
thought on a single question. And Plekhanov should be
told: it is a pity that he is now nullifying his great services
in the struggle against the liquidators during the period
of disorganisation, in the struggle against the Machists
at the height of Machism, by preaching what he himself
cannot explain. Unity with whom, then? with Nasha Zarya?
with Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta?—and on what terms?

We stand for unity, on precisely specified terms, which
have long since been approved by the majority of the
workers’, start from below, enter the underground organisation,
prove by deeds your refusal to join in liquidating the Party.

Not all who “cry” unity understand what unity is, or
help to bring it about. Those who destroy the will of the
majority of the workers are not unifiers but disrupters.

(A struggle against Plekhanov is unavoidable, now that
he has become involved in this idiotic affair, but he should
be set apart from Lyova and Mark, with the emphasis that
he had done service, but it is a pity that he is once again
on the roundabout.)
 

Write me more frequently, even if briefly. Otherwise
it is hard to get the co-operation going.

A thousand greetings to the paper, which has become
1,000 times better! Best wishes of every success!

Send me Nos. 8 and 36–38 of Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta
     No. 43 of Put Pravdy.

I haven’t received Deborin or any other books from 
Prosveshcheniye although I have asked for them more than once.
Write about the plan for the next issue.

Dear Friend,

Yesterday I received a Worrying letter from
Samoilov.[1]
He is worse. He can’t sleep. He is bored.

Chlenov advised cold (!?) baths. After four baths
Samoilov felt even worse.

This is terribly unpleasant, because we undertook, so to
speak, to get him cured. I am sending him today a letter
of recommendation from Landau, the local nerve
specialist, to Dr. De Montet at the “Mon Repos” sanatorium in
Vevey.

Evidently Samoilov should be taken to the best nerve
specialist and transferred to a sanatorium, with regular
treatment and care.

Do this, please. Feel free to spend on telephones and
travelling: we shall cover all this if need be, because we
must get Samoilov on his feet again by the autumn at all
costs.

If necessary, go and see Sali once more. But evidently
this calls for a nerve specialist. I hope you will find the
best one in Switzerland, and take Samoilov to him. I am
writing about the same matter to Rivlin: please come to
an arrangement with him to act together and share the
burden.

They say boredom is very harmful for neurasthenics.
But what is to be done? Should we take Samoilov along
with us to Poronin (we are going there on May 1) or
to Zakopane? We could do that, but it rains there all
the summer.
 

Write to me about the result of your visit to the doctor
and about your decisions. We might now try the “Mon
Repos” sanatorium.

Regards to your family. Nadezhda Konstantinovna sends
hers too.

Yours,
 Lenin

We have given a brief review of the history of the
working-class press in Russia and of the origin of Pravda. We
have tried to show how the age-long history of democratic
movements in Russia led to the formation of an
independent working-class democratic movement under the
ideological banner of Marxism—and how the twenty years’
history of Marxism and the working-class movement in
Russia, as a result of the long struggle of the workers’
vanguard against petty-bourgeois opportunist trends, led to
the rallying of the vast majority of class-conscious workers
around Pravda, which was created by the famous upsurge
of the working-class movement in the spring of 1912.

We have seen how, during the paper’s two years,
class-conscious Pravdist workers united ideologically, and to
a certain extent also organisationally, by their efforts
creating and supporting, strengthening and developing a
consistently Marxist workers’ press. Strictly insisting on their
continuity with the organised Marxists of the preceding
historical epoch, not breaking any of their decisions,
building the new on the foundations of the old, and going
systematically, unswervingly ahead to the firmly and precisely
stated aim of consistent Marxism, the Pravdist workers have
begun the solution of an unusually difficult historic task.

A whole host of enemies, a whole mass of difficulties,
both external and internal, arose in the way of the labour
movement in the 1908–11 epoch. In no country in the world
has the working-class movement hitherto succeeded in
emerging from such crises while maintaining its continuity,
its organised character, its loyalty to the old decisions,
programme and tactics.
 

But the Russian workers—or more exactly the workers
of Russia—succeeded in this; they succeeded in emerging
with flying colours from an incredibly painful crisis,
remaining loyal to the past and maintaining continuity of
organisation, while mastering new forms of training for
their forces, new methods of education and mobilisation
of fresh generations of the proletariat for the solution by
old methods of old but still outstanding historic
problems.

Of all the classes of Russian society, the working class
of Russia alone succeeded in this—not, of course, because
it stood higher than the workers of other countries: on the
contrary, it is still far behind them in organisation and
class-consciousness. It succeeded in this because it relied
at once on the experience of the workers of the whole world,
both on their theoretical experience, on the achievements
of their class-consciousness, their science and experience
summed up by Marxism and on the practical experience
of the proletarians of neighbouring countries, with their
magnificent workers’ press and their mass organisations.

The Pravdist workers, having safeguarded their own line
in the most difficult and painful of periods against
persecution from without and against despondency, scepticism,
timidity and betrayal within, can now say to themselves,
with full awareness and resolution: we know that we are
on the right path, but we are taking only the first steps
along that path, and the principal difficulties still lie ahead
of us, we still have to do a great deal to consolidate our
own position completely, and to raise to conscious activity
millions of backward, dormant and downtrodden
proletarians.

Let the petty-bourgeois “fellow-travellers” of the
proletariat, slavishly following the liberals, hold forth
contemptuously against “the underground”, against “
advertising the illegal press”; let them cherish illusions about
the June Third “legality”. We know the fragile nature of
that “legality”, we shall not forget the historic lessons of
the importance of an illegal press.

Developing further our “Pravdist” work, we shall push
ahead with the purely newspaper side hand in hand with
all sides of the workers’ cause.
 

Put Pravdy must be circulated in three, four and five
times as many copies as today. We must put out a trade
union supplement, and have representatives of all trade
unions and groups on the editorial board. Our paper must
have regional (Moscow, Urals, Caucasian, Baltic,
Ukrainian) supplements. We must consolidate—despite all the
bourgeois and petty-bourgeois nationalists of all nations
without exception—the unity of the workers of all the
nationalities of Russia, and for this purpose, incidentally,
start supplements in our paper devoted to the workers’
movement of the various nationalities of Russia.

Both the foreign department of Put Pravdy and the
chronicle of the organisational, ideological and political
life of the class-conscious workers should be expanded many
times over.

We must create a kopek Vechernaya Pravda. Put Pravdy
in its present shape is essential for the class-conscious
worker and should be still further enlarged, but it is too
dear, too difficult, too big for the worker in the street, for
the rank-and-filer, for any of the millions not yet drawn
into the movement. The advanced worker will never forget
about them, for he knows that craft isolation, the
emergence of a labour aristocracy and its separation from the
masses mean degradation and brutalisation of the
proletarian and his transformation into a miserable philistine,
a pitiful flunkey; it means loss of all hope of his
emancipation.

There is need to start a kopek Vechernaya Pravda, with
a circulation of 200,000 or 300,000 copies in the very thick
of the proletarian and semi-proletarian masses, showing
them the light of the world-wide working-class movement,
inspiring them with faith in their strength, impelling them
towards unity and helping them to rise to full
class-consciousness.

We must secure a much greater degree of organisation
on the part of the readers of Put Pravdy than there is now,
in their various factories, districts, etc., and more active
participation in correspondence and running and
circulating the paper. We must get the workers to take a regular
part in editorial work.

We must have—there is in fact a great deal more that

    

we must have! We cannot list here everything that we need;
we would even be ridiculous (and worse) if we attempted
here to enumerate all spheres, or even the principal fields
of our work!

We know that we are on the right path. We know that
we are marching hand in hand with the forward-looking
workers of all countries. We know that this field of our
work is only a small part of the whole, and that we are
still at the beginning of our great road to emancipation.
But we also know that nothing on earth can stop us on
that road.

May 20, 1914

Dear Alexander Antonovich,

Your draft constitution is being
discussed.[2] It’s a long
business: a discussion with Russia and with the Central
Committee.

The discussion article has nothing to do with the
constitution. Send it over as soon as possible. The end of the
article on self-determination should appear in May, and
has already been sent
off.[3]

Yours,
 
N. Lenin[1]


P.S. It would be a good thing if you sent us Pokrovsky’s
letters to read. Your proposal to have an exchange of
letters with him, so as to get him out of the indecent Borba,
is very interesting.
 

Notes
 

[1]
The letter also bears the signature of G. Y. Zinoviev.—Ed.
 



[2]
On May 12, 1914, A. A. Troyanovsky wrote Lenin a letter
suggesting improvements in the work of the editorial board of the

   

magazine Prosveshcheniye and enclosing a draft “constitution” to
organise the work.

Troyanovsky’s article on the national question did not appear
in Prosveshcheniye.





[3]
The Right of Nations to Self-Determination appeared in the
magazine Prosveshcheniye Nos. 4, 5 and 6, for April, May and June
1914, under the signature V. Ilyin (see present edition, Vol. 20,
pp. 393–454).

Dear Friend,

Many thanks for Volume I of Rubakin. I will return
it soon. If it is urgent, drop me a line. I am very glad that
you don’t sympathise with Sovremennik: it is a rotten
undertaking by a bloc of two lots of scoundrels, the
liquidators and the Narodniks. We shall attack it violently.
(Mr. Stankevich invited me; I replied: “Because I do not
agree in the main, I must decline to be a
contributor.”[1]

)



Of course, to earn a living all of us sometimes have to
work in bourgeois publications! But Messrs. Martov and
Dan have made a “demonstration” of it! Plekhanov, too,
is in that disgraceful
place![2]

I shall be glad to send you the credential of a delegate:
do you want it to be legal (how?) or
illegal?[3]

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Hanecki has put an “ultimatum”: give us 250 kronen,
otherwise we don’t go to Brussels. We are not sending them!

I am absolutely against it. It will be even better if
they[1]
don’t go. Let Tyszka “make peace” with the P.S.P.—but
we are waiting for a reply from the opposition.

Lovely!

Take Hanecki a negative reply!

was a member, and the opposition was the attitude to the
liquidators and the P.S.P. Lenin censured the policies of the Chief
Executive and sympathised with the opposition.

Dear Grigory Lvovich,

I have just learned that the International Congress has
been transferred to Paris for August 9
(N. S.).[2] I hope
you are going—and well ahead of time, in order to make
preparations in Paris (Kamsky was in the delegation
at
Brussels,[3] and will give you all the information). Reply
at once. Even more important is the question of Samoilov’s
going. Will he be able to go? It is quite probable that none
of the members of the Duma will be able to arrive in time
from Russia. Therefore it is essential that Samoilov should
go. It would be best for you to arrange to travel with him.
He could be fixed up (if his treatment so requires) in a
pension near Paris (provided there is a telephone) (or even in
a clinic) in the country, half an hour or so away by rail.
He will have to come to Paris two or three times at most,
for 3 or 4 hours each time (possibly even less), so that from
the standpoint of his treatment this can probably be arranged.
It is only necessary to think it all out beforehand and
arrange it by correspondence. (We are not going; Litvinov
or Kamsky will attend the I.S.B.)—write to Dr. 
Wladimirsky (rue Baillon. 10. Paris); he will give advice.

I ask you particularly to make every effort to prepare
and arrange this as carefully as possible. If it turns out
that Samoilov’s journey is absolutely impossible, telegraph
me immediately (the address is: Uljanow. Poronin): “
nievozmozno”.[1]

Otherwise, if he can go and you undertake
to organise everything, telegraph: “jedet” (=Samoilov
is going) or “jedem ” (=both you and Samoilov are going).
 

I need a cabled reply (you will easily guess
why[4]). In
addition, write at once.

Regards to Fyodor Nikitich and your family.

Yours,
 V. I.

P.S. It is possible—in the event of war—that you will
be receiving letters and money for me. I hope we shall then
arrange for regular transmission. If I have to leave, I shall
cable you.

Absender: Wl. Uljanow. Poronin (Galizien).
 

Notes
 

[1]
Impossible.—Ed.
 



[2]
An international congress was to have been held in Vienna on
August 23, 1914. In connection with the outbreak of war between
Austria and Serbia, the International Socialist Bureau decided to
convene the congress in Paris earlier, namely, on August 9. It was
not held.





[3]
The delegation to the Brussels “Unity” Conference included,
from the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., Inessa Armand
(Petrova), M. Vladimirsky (Kamsky) and I. Popov.





[4]
Lenin was apparently in need of a cabled reply to summon someone
from Russia in the event F. Samoilov was unable to attend the
Congress.

Dear Comrade,

Our trip did not come
off.[2] I don’t know whether you
have got the letters. If you have, send me a reply to check
whether the post is working. You may now find yourself,
as an exception and an extremely rare one at that, an
inhabitant of a non-belligerent country; so that if only the
post from you to us functions, you must be sure to keep
us informed, and send us information from the papers to
which we have no access. Of course, only the most
important information (particularly about Russia).

Let me know whether you will have (or whether you
already have) any good contacts with Stockholm, and
whether you can transmit letters, provide an address for
money from Russia, etc.

Regards,
 Yours,
 
V. I.[1]

 

Notes

Dear Comrade,

I have safely arrived with all my family at
Zurich.[2]

Legitimationen[1]

were asked for only at Innsbruck and
Feldkirche: your help was therefore extremely useful to
me. Passports are required for entry into Switzerland, but
I was allowed in without a passport when I mentioned
Greulich. Very best regards and deepest gratitude.

With Party greetings,

The outbreak of the First World War found Lenin in the village
of Poronin (Galicia). On July 25 (August 7), the Austrian
authorities carried out a search of Lenin’s quarters, and the gendarme
sergeant-major confiscated the manuscript of Lenin’s article on
the agrarian question, taking the tables in it to be a code. Lenin
was arrested the next day. After a fortnight’s detention, he was
released through the efforts of Russian and Polish Social–
Democrats and with the help of Austrian socialists Viktor Adler and
deputy of the Austrian Parliament Hermann Diamant. He was
allowed to leave Austria for Switzerland. On August 23 (

   

September 5), 1914, Lenin arrived in Berne together with N. K.
Krupskaya and her mother, Y. V. Krupskaya.

September 6

Dear Comrade,

I arrived here safely yesterday with my whole family,
after a brief captivity in Austria. Zinoviev will also be
coming. We thought of settling in Geneva, where all our
old sympathies attract us. But then we began to hesitate
in favour of Berne. They say that there’s a rush to Geneva
of new French émigrés from Paris, Brussels, etc. We
wonder if there is an excessive rise in prices, particularly
of rents. Also we shall have to make our arrangements on a
temporary basis: is it possible to take furnished rooms (two
small ones), with use of kitchen, by the month?

One other question: if it is not too much trouble, please
call at the Société de lecture (Grand’ Rue. 11) and take their
rules; I must see whether they have been changed in any
way. It is this
Société[1] that particularly attracts me to
Geneva, although here too?... It’s expensive.... What about
a printing press? Is there a Russian one? Can one now
publish a leaflet, etc.? In Russian? With special precautions,
or as before (against the war, of course, and against the new
type of nationalists, from Haase to Vandervelde and
Guesde—they’ve all played false!). You will oblige me very
much by replying to all these questions as soon as possible.
Are there any other Bolshevik comrades in Geneva?
Including those going to Russia? Best regards from all of
us to you, to Comrade Olga and all our friends.

Yours,
 N. Lenin

Dear Friend,

I have your letter telling me of the talk with Sigg about
the
publication.[1] That’s excellent! Take as much as you
require of the 160 francs (as little as possible, of course,
because we are hoping to publish a little miscellany) and
publish the
manifesto[2] (not the
theses[3] but the
manifesto) with the maximum precautions; don’t print many
(200 or 300) and hide the stock without fail at the Swiss
deputy’s.

If you do not have the text of the manifesto, but only
the, theses, get the manifesto at Lausanne.

I am awaiting your reply.

Yours,
 Lenin

We shall send what is published to Paris and to Russia:
a hundred for abroad, two hundred for Russia. We shall
write again about how to send them and to what addresses.

“Our theses, worked out by the Central Committee of
the Party,” Comrade Lenin began, “were sent to the
Italians, and many of them, unfortunately not all, were
incorporated in the Lugano
resolution.”[2]

The opponent very much liked the first part of
Plekhanov’s report, dealing with the betrayal of the German
Social-Democrats,[3] but the same could not be said about
the second part, in which Plekhanov tried to justify
completely the stand of the French socialists.

How was it possible to defend French socialism, which
had called on the Italians to enter the war? It was difficult
to find any passages to justify this appeal even in the
extremely elastic resolutions of the International.

The present war had shown the enormous wave of
opportunism that had risen out of the depths of European
socialism. The European opportunists, in order to
rehabilitate themselves, had tried to fall back on the old and
hackneyed argument about “keeping the organisation intact”.
The orthodox Germans had gone back on their stand to
preserve the formal unity of the party. He, Comrade Lenin,
had always pointed out the opportunism lurking in such an
approach, he had always fought against conciliatory
attitudes which sacrifice principles. All the resolutions of
Vandervelde and Kautsky suffered from this opportunist
tendency of smoothing over obvious contradictions. Kautsky,
in his article “About the
War”,[4] had even talked

    

himself into justifying everybody, asserting that all were right
from their point of view, since subjectively they considered
themselves to be in danger and subjectively considered their
right to exist to have been violated. Of course, from the
standpoint of the psychology of the moment and
humanitarian considerations, such a mood was more
comprehensible among the French and could therefore be viewed with
greater sympathy; still socialism could not argue from
fear of attack alone, and it had to be frankly said that
there was more chauvinism than socialism in the behaviour
of the French.

Plekhanov, Lenin said further, criticised those comrades
who asserted that it was impossible to find out who
attacked first. In the opponent’s opinion, the present war
was not at all accidental, and had not depended on this
or that attack, but had been prepared by all the conditions
of development of bourgeois society. It had been predicted
long ago, and precisely in such a combination and precisely
along such lines. The Basle Congress spoke about it quite
clearly, and even foresaw that Serbia would be the pretext
for a conflict.

Comrade Lenin then analysed the duty of socialists in
wartime. Social-Democrats did their duty only when they
fought chauvinist passions at home. And the Serbian
Social-Democrats[5] offered the best example of such fulfilment
of duty.

Not forgetting the words of Marx that “the
workingmen have no country”, the proletariat should take part,
not in defending the old framework of the bourgeois states,
but in creating a new framework for socialist republics.
And the great mass of the proletariat would realise this
through its sure instinct. What was going on in Europe
was nothing but speculation on the worst—and the most
deep-rooted—of prejudices. “Our task,” said Lenin, “is
not to swim with the tide, but to transform the national,
the pseudo-national war into a resolute encounter of the
proletariat with the ruling classes.”

Lenin then went on to criticise the entry of socialists
into governments, and pointed out the responsibility
falling on socialists who back their government’s every
step.
 

“It is better to go to a neutral country and from there
to tell the truth, it is better to make a free and independent
appeal to the proletariat, than to become a Minister”—
with those words the opponent ended his short speech.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Plekhanov’s lecture, “On the Attitude of the Socialists to the War”,
given in Lausanne on October 11, 1914, was organised by the local
Menshevik group for the promotion of the R.S.D.L.P.

In the debate that followed, Lenin was the only speaker (no
one else took the floor). Reports on Plekhanov’s lecture, Lenin’s
speech and Plekhanov’s summing-up speech appeared in the Paris
Menshevik newspaper Golos (Voice) Nos. 31, 32 and 33 on
October 18, 20 and 21, 1914, under the title of “Russian
Social-Democratic Leaders on the War”.

The speeches were taken down by a Golos correspondent (
initials: I. K.).





[2]
Italo-Swiss Socialist Conference, in whose preparation Lenin took
part, was held at Lugano on September 27, 1914. Lenin’s theses
on the war were discussed at the conference and were partially
included in the resolution. The conference was attended by R. 
Grimm, Paul Pflüger and others from Switzerland, and
Serrati, Lazzari, Morgari, Turati, Modigliani and others from Italy.
The resolution of the conference characterised the war as
imperialist and called on the proletariat to wage an international
struggle for peace. While the decisions of the conference were not
consistently internationalist or thoroughly revolutionary, they
were, nevertheless, a step forward in the preparation for restoring
international proletarian ties.





[3]
On August 4, 1914, the Social-Democratic Group in the Reichstag
joined the bourgeois deputies in voting a 5,000 million war loan
to the Kaiser Government, thereby endorsing Wilhelm II’s
imperialist policy. It later turned out that the Left-wing
Social-Democrats opposed the granting of war credits during the
discussion of the question before the Reichstag sitting, but

   

subsequently voted for them in conformity with a majority
decision of the opportunist Social-Democrats.





[4]
Karl Kautsky’s article “Die Sozialdemokratie im Kriege” in
Die Neue Zeit No. 1, October 2, 1914.





[5]
The Serbian Social-Democrats, who were the first to have to take
a stand on the war, did not waver in adopting an internationalist
attitude: in parliament, their deputies voted against war credits.
Their newspaper, Rabochaya Gazeta (Workers’ Newspaper),
published in Ni&shat, also conducted a campaign against the chauvinists.

The speaker divided his lecture into two parts:
clarifying the nature of the present war, and the attitude of
socialists to the war.

For a Marxist clarifying the nature of the war is a
necessary preliminary for deciding the question of his attitude
to it. But for such a clarification it is essential, first and
foremost, to establish the objective conditions and concrete
circumstances of the war in question. It is necessary to
consider the war in the historical environment in which it
is taking place, only then can one determine one’s attitude
to it. Otherwise, the resulting interpretation will be not
materialist but eclectic.

Depending on the historical circumstances, the
relationship of classes, etc., the attitude to war must be different
at different times. It is absurd once and for all to renounce
participation in war in principle. On the other hand, it
is also absurd to divide wars into defensive and aggressive.
In 1848, Marx hated Russia, because at that time democracy
in Germany could not win out and develop, or unite the
country into a single national whole, so long as the
reactionary hand of backward Russia hung heavy over her.

In order to clarify one’s attitude to the present war,
one must understand how it differs from previous wars,
and what its peculiar features are.

Has the bourgeoisie given such an explanation? No.
Far from having given one, it will not manage to give one
in any circumstances. Judging by what is going on among

    

the socialists, one might think that they, too, have no idea
of the distinctive features of the present war.

Yet, the socialists have given an excellent explanation
of it, and have predicted it. More than that, there is
not a single speech by a socialist deputy, not a single
article by a socialist publicist, that does not contain that
explanation. It is so simple that people somehow do not
take notice of it, and yet it provides the key to the
correct attitude to the present war.

The present war is an imperialist one, and that is its basic
feature.

In order to clarify this, it is necessary to examine the
nature of previous wars, and that of the imperialist war.

Lenin dwelt in considerable detail on the characteristics
of wars at the end of the 18th and during the whole of the
19th centuries. They were all national wars, which
accompanied and promoted the creation of national states.

These wars marked the destruction of feudalism, and
were an expression of the struggle of the new, bourgeois
society against feudal society. The national state was a
necessary phase in the development of capitalism. The
struggle for the self-determination of a nation, for its
independence, for freedom to use its language, for popular
representation, served this end—the creation of national
states, that ground necessary at a certain stage of
capitalism for the development of the productive forces.

Such was the character of wars from the time of the great
French Revolution up to and including the Italian and
Prussian wars.

This task of the national wars was performed either by
democracy itself or with the help of Bismarck, quite
independently of the will and the consciousness of those who
took part in them. The triumph of present-day civilisation,
the full flowering of capitalism, the drawing of the whole
people and of all nations into capitalism—that was the
outcome of national wars, the wars at the beginning of
capitalism.

An imperialist war is quite a different matter. On this
point, there was no disagreement among the socialists of
all countries and all trends. At all congresses, in discussing
resolutions on the attitude to a possible war, everyone

    

was always agreed that this war would be an imperialist
one. All European countries have already reached an equal
stage in the development of capitalism, all of them have
already yielded everything that capitalism can yield.
Capitalism has already attained its highest form, and is no
longer exporting commodities, but capital. It is beginning
to find its national framework too small for it, and now
the struggle is on for the last free scraps of the earth. If
national wars in the 18th and 19th centuries marked the
beginning of capitalism, imperialist wars point to its end.

The whole end of the 19th century and the beginning
of the 20th century were filled with imperialist policy.

Imperialism is what impresses a quite specific stamp
on the present war, distinguishing it from all its
predecessors.

Only by examining this war in its distinctive historical
environment, as a Marxist must do, can we clarify our
attitude to it. Otherwise we shall be operating with old
conceptions and arguments, applied to a different, an old
situation. Among such obsolete conceptions are the
fatherland idea and the division, mentioned earlier, of
wars into defensive and aggressive.

Of course, even now there are blotches of the old colour
in the living picture of reality. Thus, of all the warring
countries, the Serbs alone are still fighting for national
existence. In India and China, too, class-conscious
proletarians could not take any other path but the national
one, because their countries have not yet been formed into
national states. If China had to carry on an offensive war
for this purpose, we could only sympathise with her, because
objectively it would be a progressive war. In exactly the
same way, Marx in 1848 could call for an offensive war
against Russia.

And so the end of the 19th century and the beginning of
the 20th are characterised by imperialist policy.

Imperialism is that state of capitalism when, having
done all that it could, it turns towards decline. It is a
special epoch, not in the minds of socialists, but in actual
relationships. A struggle is on for a division of the
remaining portions. It is the last historical task of capitalism.
We cannot say how long this epoch will last. There may

    

well be several such wars, but there must be a clear
understanding that these are quite different wars from
those waged earlier, and that, accordingly, the tasks facing
socialists have changed.

To tackle these new tasks the proletarian party may
need organisations of a very different type.

Kautsky, in his pamphlet Weg zur
Macht,[1]

pointed out,
in making a careful and detailed examination of economic
phenomena and drawing very cautious conclusions from
them, that we were entering a phase quite unlike the old
peaceful and gradual development.

It is hard to say just now what the new form of
organisation, corresponding to this phase, should be. But it is
clear that in view of the new tasks, the proletariat will
have to create new organisations or modify the old. All
the more absurd is the fear of disarray in one’s
organisation, so vividly manifest among the German Social–
Democrats; all the more absurd is this legalism at all costs. We
know that the St. Petersburg Committee has issued an
illegal leaflet against the war. The same has been done
by the Caucasian and certain other organisations in
Russia. There is no doubt that this could also be done abroad,
without any rupture of ties.

Legality, of course, is a most valuable thing, and Engels
had good reason to say: “Messrs, bourgeois, you will have
to be the first to break your
legality!”[3] What is now
going on might teach the German Social-Democrats a
lesson, because a government which has always boasted of
its legality is not put out by now having violated it all
along the line. In this respect, the brutal order of the
Berlin Commandant, which he forced
Vorwärts[4] to run on
its front page, may prove useful. But Vorwärts itself, once
it renounced the class struggle on pain of being closed down,
and promised not to refer to it until the end of the war,
has committed suicide. It is dead, as the Paris
Golos,[5]
now the best socialist paper in Europe, has rightly said.
The more frequently and the more violently I differed with
Martov before, the more definitely I must say now that
that writer is now doing precisely what a Social-Democrat

    

should do. He is criticising his own government, he is
unmasking his own bourgeoisie, he is accusing his own
Ministers. Meanwhile, those socialists who have disarmed in
relation to their own government, and devote themselves
to exposing and shaming the Ministers and ruling classes
of another country, play the part of bourgeois writers.
Südekum himself is objectively playing the part of agent of
the German Government, as others play it in relation to
the French and Russian allies.

Socialists who fail to realise that the present war is
imperialist, who fail to take a historical view of it, will
understand nothing about the war. They are capable of taking
a childishly naïve view of it, in this sense, that at night
one seized the other by the throat, and the neighbours have
to save the victim of attack, or in cowardly fashion to shut
themselves away from the fight “behind locked doors”
(in Plekhanov’s words).

We shall not allow ourselves to be deceived, and let the
bourgeois advisers explain the war as simply as that:
people were living at peace, then one attacked, and the
other is defending himself.

Comrade Lenin read an extract from an article by
Luzzatti, carried by an Italian newspaper. In that article,
the Italian politician rejoices that the great victor in the
war turned out to be ... the fatherland, the idea of
fatherland, and repeats that we should remember the words of
Cicero who said that “civil war is the greatest evil”.

This is what the bourgeoisie have managed to achieve,
this is what excites and delights them most, this is what they
have spent vast sums and efforts on. They are trying to
convince us that it is the same old, conventional, national war.

No, indeed. The era of national wars is past. This is
an imperialist war, and the task of socialists is to turn
the “national” war into a civil war.

We all expected this imperialist war, and prepared for
it. And if this is so, it is not at all important who attacked
first; all were preparing for the war, and the attacker was
the one who thought it most advantageous to do so at the
particular moment.

Comrade Lenin then went on to define the conception
of “fatherland” from the socialist point of view.
 

This conception was clearly and precisely defined by
the Communist Manifesto, in the brilliant pages whose
truth has been fully tested and justified by experience.
Lenin read an extract from the Communist Manifesto, where
the conception of fatherland is regarded as a historical
category, which corresponds to the development of society
at a definite stage and which later becomes unnecessary.
The proletariat cannot love what it has not got. The
proletariat has no country.

What are the tasks of the socialists in the present war?

Comrade Lenin read the Stuttgart resolution, later
confirmed and supplemented at Copenhagen and
Basle.[6]
This resolution clearly states the socialists’ methods of
combating the trends leading to war and their duties in
respect of a war that has broken out. These duties are
defined by the examples of the Russian revolution and the
Paris Commune. The Stuttgart resolution was carefully
worded, in consideration of all kinds of criminal laws,
but it indicated the task clearly. The Paris Commune is
civil war. The form, the time and the place are a different
matter, but the direction of our work is clearly defined.

From this angle, Comrade Lenin then examined the
actual stand taken by socialists in the various countries.
Apart from the Serbs, the Russians have done their duty,
as the Italian Avanti! notes, and Keir Hardie is doing it
by exposing the policy of Edward Grey.

Once the war is on, it is impossible to escape it. One
must go and do one’s duty as a socialist. In a war, people
think and ponder probably even more than “at home”.
One must go out and organise the proletariat there for
the final aim, because it is Utopian to imagine that the
proletariat will tread a peaceful path to it. It is
impossible to go over from capitalism to socialism without
breaking up the national framework, just as it was impossible
to pass from feudalism to capitalism without national ideas.

[2]
Lenin’s lecture on “The Proletariat and the War” was given
in Lausanne on October 14, 1914, two days after Plekhanov’s
social-chauvinist lecture, and was carried in the Paris Golos
Nos. 37 and 38 on October 25 and 27. The report of the lecture
was filed by a Golos correspondent (initials: I. K.) who noted that
“Lenin’s lecture was held before a great concourse of people”.





[3]
See Engels, Socialism in Germany, Section One.





[4]
On September 27, 1914, the central organ of the German
Social-Democrats, Vorwärts, carried an article, “Germany and Foreign
Countries”, which timidly suggested that the German and French
proletariat were involved in the war against their will. On this
pretext the paper was banned by the Commander of the
Brandenburg district, General von Kessel. Haase and Fischer
requested that the ban be lifted. Kessel agreed, provided Vorwärts
refrained from dealing “with the subject of class hatred and the class
struggle”. The editors accepted the condition, and the paper
reappeared on October 1, frontpaging General Kessel’s order on
the resumption of its publication.





[5]
Golos (Voice)—-a Menshevik-Trotskyist daily published in Paris
from September 1914 to January 1915, advocating a Centrist
stand.

Early in the First World War (1914–18), Golos carried Martov’s
articles against the social-chauvinists. That was when Lenin
approved of the paper’s activity. Following Martov’s turn to the
right, the paper began to defend the social-chauvinists,
preferring “unity with the social-chauvinists to drawing closer to those
who are irreconcilably hostile to social-chauvinism” (see present
edition, Vol. 21, p. 113).

From January 1915, Golos was replaced by Nashe Slovo (Our
Word).

of the Second International in Stuttgart (1907), Copenhagen
(1910) and Basle (1912).

Dear V. K.,

I am sending you the manifesto on account of five
amendments. Please make them in the proofs as carefully as
possible.[1]

I am also sending “A Reply to
Vandervelde”[2]—for
setting.

As many articles as possible should be set in brevier.
We must get the maximum of material into the two pages.
It’s a pity that we hadn’t thought of this when sending
the manifesto for setting.

The whole question now is, how many thousands of
letters can be got into the two pages? The C.O.’s old format
should be taken (there is no masthead in Geneva it is
desirable to make up the new masthead as economically
as possible, so as to lose the least space: say, have the
masthead fit in a corner, instead of “covering” all three
columns).

We are waiting for an exact calculation of the size: how
many letters in brevier can be got in.

Best of all, send us both the proof of the manifesto (the
second proof) and samples of all types, including the very
smallest.

The masthead for the issue (this should be the next No.
of the C.O.) should also specify the price: 10 cts., I think.
In any case, it is essential to send us a proof of the issue
made up into pages.

If the whole thing could be set up in brevier, with the
C.O. format, we should have about 40,000 letters in the
two pages. We could then insert another couple of articles
which we are preparing. (If the manifesto has already been

    

set, and in an unsuitable type, etc., we shall publish it
separately.)

You will have considerable correspondence expenses:
everything must be sent in envelopes, not in wrappers.
Keep a record of your postal expenses and draw upon the
“fund” (160 frs.), otherwise you will be ruined!

Ask Syoma to get us Sozialistische Monatshefte [all the
issues since the war ] from the Bundists: if necessary, we
shall pay, and will guarantee to return them at the time
fixed (even with a deposit, if required).

Best wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Let me know when the two-page issue of the C.O.
can be ready. I shall be lecturing at Montreux shortly
(I don’t know exactly when) and can call on you, should
it be
necessary.[3]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin made five amendments in the manifesto of the C.C., R.S.D.L.P.,
which copy is now at the Central Party Archives of the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U. The manifesto
was published under the title “The War and Russian
Social-Democracy” in the Central Organ of the R.S.D.L.P., 
Sotsial-Demokrat No. 33, November 1, 1914.





[2]
The Bolsheviks’ reply to E. Vandervelde’s telegram urging the
Duma Social-Democratic group to support the Russian
Government in the war against Germany. The reply signed by the C.C.
of the R.S.D.L.P. was published in Sotsial-Demokrat No. 33,
November 1, 1914. The Bolsheviks said they believed that in the
interests of democracy and socialism it was an urgent task of the
revolutionary proletarian party in the period of imperialist war
to extend and strengthen the class organisations of the workers
and to develop their class struggle against the imperialist
bourgeoisie and their own governments.





[3]
Lenin read his lecture on the war at Montreux (near Clarens) on
Monday, October 26, and in Zurich, on Tuesday, October 27,
1914.

Dear V. K.,

The compositor has dragged things out terribly! He
promised the manifesto for Monday, and today is Friday.
Terrible!

Will it always be like this?

As regards the address to be put on the paper: is it worth
while taking a 
case[1]

?

After all
(1) this will make you go
to the Post Office 100 times for nothing,
(2) the authorities
will eventually know who has taken the box. Think it
over, whether it would not be better to indicate, as the
address, Bibliothèque russe—for the editorial board of
the C.O.?

Let’s think about it.

Nicolet, they say, is incapable of keeping and
transmitting money, and so forth.

I have written about the order of the articles: send us
the proofs as they come in. Then it will not be necessary
to waste two days (that’s terribly long) on sending what
has been made up (if it is sent by express, one day is more
than enough).

We are waiting impatiently for the proofs.

On Monday, I am lecturing at Montreux, on Tuesday,
at Zurich. I won’t go to Geneva.

Regards and best wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

I have just received your letter. As regards Jaurès and
Frank, we shall postpone it for a while. We have to wait.
No point in just censuring them. And there is nothing
to praise them for. We have decided to keep quiet for a while.

What about the proofs? Will it always take that long?
The last No. of the C.O. was in December 1913—No. 32.
So this one must be No. 33.

November 14, 1914

Dear Friend,

I am very glad to hear from you that the C.O. has been
received, and is to go where it should.

As regards your speech at the congress of the Swedish
Social-Democrats, I can advise only this: either no speech
at all, or a statement that you greet the fraternal party
of the Swedish workers and wish it every success in the
spirit of revolutionary international
Social-Democracy.[1]
If you cannot say this, then it is not worth while speaking
at all. But if possible, of course, it would be best to add
(1) that the Russian workers have expressed their view
through the Social-Democratic Duma group, which did not
vote for the budget,
(2) that they are issuing illegal
leaflets in St. Petersburg, Riga, Moscow and the Caucasus,
(3) that the organs of their Party, the C.C. and the C.O.,
have declared against international opportunism.

Is this “done”?—H’m.... Of course, Branting won’t like
it, but it’s not our business to “please” the opportunists.
If you are given 10–12 minutes and freedom of speech, then
you should speak against German (and other) opportunism,
without, of course, in any way touching either the
Swedish Social-Democrats or their “Young”, and so forth. As
regards restoring the International, I would advise you
not to say anything, either directly or indirectly. I am
sending you an article (a very good one!) on this theme
(translate it and send it to
Russia).[2] We shall keep silent
on the question of restoring the International, and stay
on the side lines. We must bide our time. The
Leftists[3]
    

are beginning to stir among the Germans: if they have a
split, then, maybe, the International will be saved from
rotting.

As regards the watchword of “peace”, you are mistaken
if you think the bourgeoisie doesn’t even want to hear
of it. Today I have been reading the English Economist.
The wise bourgeois of an advanced country are for peace
(of course, in order to strengthen
capitalism).[4] But we
must not let ourselves be confused with the petty-bourgeois,
sentimental liberals, etc. The epoch of the bayonet has
begun. This is a fact; consequently, we have to fight with
such a weapon too.

One of these days, the slogan of peace will be taken up
by the German bourgeoisie, and particularly by the 
opportunists. We must stand for the watchword of the
revolutionary proletariat, capable of fighting for its own aims—
and that is civil war. This too is a very concrete watchword,
and it alone unerringly reveals the main trends: either
for the proletarian, or for the bourgeois cause.

As regards the debt to the
Swedes,[5] neither I nor
Nadezhda Konstantinovna can remember anything at all. But
it is quite possible that either I did not know, or have
forgotten. It would be a very good thing, therefore, to send
them a friendly letter of thanks, suggesting that the debt
should be “donated”. I think you yourself could do this,
on behalf of the Petrograd Committee, for example, plus
some Social-Democratic deputies, authorising you in
Petrograd. I believe this would be the best form. I think
you should act in the same way on the loan. I would not
advise pushing a letter from me (it could start “factional”
squabbles!). I will send a letter if you insist, but my
advice is: don’t. Without me they will be better inclined to
give, really! Refer to Petrovsky, get a letter from him
(if need be), this is better, really!

All the very best,
 Yours,
 N. Lenin

P.S. If Kollontai translates the Central Committee
manifesto (from No. 33 of the C.O.) into German, perhaps
you will send us a copy?
 

P.S. About the “peace” watchword. An interesting
article by Bernstein in the last issue of Neue Zeit shows that
in Britain, where the bourgeoisie is cleverest and freest
of all, etc., there is a trend for peace from the standpoint of
ultra-opportunism. That is, peace is the best guarantee
of “social peace”, i.e., the submission of the proletariat
to the bourgeoisie, the pacification of the proletariat,
the continuation of the existence of capitalism.
Bernstein’s article does not elaborate this. But it is
obvious that there are many such peacemakers among the
liberal and radical bourgeois of all countries. Add to this
(1) that all chauvinists are also for peace (only on what
terms)—and in the legal press, we shall not be allowed
to speak of our terms!
(2) that the German and Russian
Courts are also for a particular kind of peace with each other
(in secret today, half-open tomorrow),
(3) that all the
sentimental bourgeois and philistines are “for peace” from
the “anti-revolutionary”, philistine, slavish, etc.,
standpoint.

The question is, who objectively now benefits from the
watchword of peace? In any case, not the propaganda of
the ideas of the revolutionary proletariat! Not the idea
of utilising the war to hasten the collapse of capitalism!

Add to this the victory of the opportunist chauvinists
in nearly all countries: the slogan of peace will only help
them to extricate themselves.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Congress of the Swedish Social-Democratic Party took place
in Stockholm on November 23, 1914. On the opening day, A. 
Shlyapnikov, under the pseudonym of Belenin, made a declaration
on behalf of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. in accordance with the
instructions given in the present letter (see also present edition,
Vol. 21, p. 108).





[2]

A. Pannekoek’s article, “Der Zusammenbruch der
Internationale” (The Collapse of the International), was published in the
Swiss Left-wing Social-Democratic newspaper, Berner Tagwacht
Nos. 245, 246 and 247 of October 20, 21 and 22, 1914.





[3]
The formation within the German Social-Democratic Party of
an internationalist Left-wing group headed by Karl Liebknecht
and Rosa Luxemburg, which formed the nucleus of the Spartacus
League.





[4]
An apparent reference to the article “The Opening of
Parliament”, published in the British bourgeois journal The Economist
No. 3, 716, November 14, 1914.

Lenin’s article “Bourgeois Philanthropists and
Revolutionary Social-Democracy” (see present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 192–93)
gives a review of The Economist’s stand on peace.





[5]
The loan of 3,000 kronen was obtained by the R.S.D.L.P. from
the Swedish Social-Democratic Party in 1907 during its Fifth
Congress (London).

November 25

Dear Friend,

Last night we read of the arrest of 11 people (including
5 members of the R.S.D.L. Duma
group[2]) near Petrograd,
and we sent a telegram to Branting today to help you
ascertain (through the Finns le cas
échéant[1]

whether the
5 members of the R.S.D.L. Duma group have been arrested.

It will be a bad blow if it is true!

But all the more impermissible in that case will be your
departure for Denmark. In any case, I protest energetically
against such a departure. This is the time for you to be in
Stockholm personally, in order to establish better, more
frequent and more extensive contacts. This is a difficult
job, it requires an experienced person, with a knowledge
of at least one foreign language. It cannot be left just
to “anyone” to look after.

If you are pressed (by the police) in Stockholm, you
should hide in some village near Stockholm (this is easily
done, they have telephones everywhere). I think Kollontai,
too, could soon easily come to Stockholm or to some
suburban place, incognito.

We shall soon be issuing No. 34 of the C.O., and then
No. 35 as well.

Reply as quickly as possible. We have been getting
all your letters. We have also received the
document[3]
of the liquidators (their reply to Vandervelde). Thanks.

All good wishes, and we are awaiting your news.

Yours,
 Lenin

[2]
The arrest of Bolsheviks attending a conference at Ozerki, near

   

Petrograd, among them members of the R.S.D.L. group in the
Fourth Duma.

The conference was held from November 2 to 4 (15 to 17), 1914,
and was attended by Bolsheviks from Petrograd,
Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Kharkov and Riga.

On November 4 (17), when the conference had just ended, the
police, on information of a provocateur, raided the premises.
During the search, copies of Lenin’s theses on the war and 
Sotsial-Demokrat No. 33, which carried the C.C., R.S.D.L.P. manifesto,
The War and Russian Social-Democracy, were confiscated from
Duma Bolshevik deputies Petrovsky, Badayev and others. All
the participants in the conference were arrested, except for the
deputies, because of their parliamentary immunity. But they
too were arrested two days later, put on trial and exiled for life
to Eastern Siberia. Lenin analysed the results of the trial in his
article “What Has Been Revealed by the Trial of the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Duma Group”, which was published
in Sotsial-Demokrat No. 40 on March 29, 1915 (see present
edition, Vol. 21, pp. 171–77).





[3]
The reply of the Petrograd liquidators (P. P. Maslov, A. N.
Potresov, N. Cherevanin [F. A. Lipkin] and others) to E. 
Vandervelde’s telegram urging the Russian Social-Democrats not to
campaign against the war. The liquidators justified the Belgian,
French and British socialists who had entered their bourgeois
governments, and supported the social-chauvinists, and declared
that they, for their part, did not oppose the war. Their reply was
published in Sotsial-Demokrat No. 34, with a note from the
Editorial Board.

Dear and esteemed Comrade,

I am very grateful to you for sending me the
leaflet[2]
(for the time being, I can only pass it on to the Rabotnitsa
editorial board members here—they have already sent a
letter to Clara Zetkin, with a content similar to yours,
evidently), and also for the offer to send information about
Britain for the C.O. I am in correspondence with a comrade
in London (Mr. Litvinoff), who represents our Party’s C.C.
in the I.S.B.; but of course the more connections we have
with representatives of the Left wing of the International,
the better. I quite agree with you that these representatives
ought to keep closer together, and take common counsel.
And it is with this end in view that I take advantage of
your kind letter to continue the conversation you began.

You don’t seem to agree with the slogan of civil war
quite fully, but assign to it, one might say, a subordinate
(and, I think, even conditional) place, behind the slogan
of peace. And you emphasise that “we need to put forward
a slogan that would unite everyone”.

Let me say frankly that what I fear most at present is
just this kind of blanket unification which, I am convinced,
is the most dangerous and the most harmful thing for the
proletariat. After all, Kautsky has already invented, in
Neue Zeit, an ultra-“unifying”
theory,[3]
which....[1]

A reference to the appeal to women which Alexandra Kollontai
wrote and sent to Lenin in her letter of November 28, 1914, for
publication in Sotsial-Demokrat. It was not published.

A reference to Kautsky’s articles: =

1) “Die Internationalität und

2) “Die Sozialdemokratie im Kriege”
(Social-Democracy in the War), Die Neue Zeit No. 1, October 2,
1914. In “Die Sozialdemokratie im Kriege” he wrote that “if it comes
to war, every nation has to defend itself as best it can. It follows
that Social-Democrats of all nations have an equal right or an
equal duty to take part in this defence; none should hurl
reproaches at another.”

Dear V. K.,

I have received the C.O. You are doing an excellent job;
best regards and thanks!

I also enclose a little note for No. 35. It will squeeze in,
I hope?

Perhaps something else can be squeezed in as well?

Regards!
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. I believe Syoma reads Vorwärts? Would he be so kind
as to send us extracts (brief ones) of the most interesting
items? For example, about the conflict between the 
Vorwärts editorial board and the Central Committee of the
trade
unions?[1] About my lecture at
Zurich?[2] About the
victory of the opportunists in Sweden, etc.? Only the most
important news in a couple of words, so that we can keep
track of the Vorwärts line.

Likewise with the German Social-Democratic papers in
America.

Does he read them?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The General Commission of the German trade unions accused
Vorwärts of giving insufficient attention to practical problems
and slack defence against attacks by other Socialist parties, and
also of generalising German acts of cruelty while justifying those
of the enemy (see Vorwärts Nos. 321, 323 and 325, November 24,
26 and 28, 1914—“Aus der Partei”).



__PRINTERS_P_659_COMMENT__
42*




[2]
Lenin read his lecture, “The War and Social-Democracy”, in
Zurich, apparently not earlier than October 27, 1914. In
connection with it, Vorwärts No. 308 published an item, “Lenin über
die ukrainische Frage” (Lenin on the Ukrainian Question) on
November 10, 1914. Vorwärts No. 319, November 22, 1914, carried
an item saying that Lenin had asked the Editorial Board to
inform readers that lie had dealt not only with the struggle against
tsarism (and, in this connection, with the Ukrainian question),
but also with the collapse of the Second International and the
stand taken by the German and Austrian Social-Democrats during
the war.

Dear V. K.,

I enclose the proofs.

We shall have to wait with
No.36.[2] It’s not yet written,
and we ought to wait a little while.

Best regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. I read with interest the remarks about “national
pride”, but—could not agree. Chauvinism should be “
spotlighted” from different
angles.[3]

Be sure to insert the following about the postponement.

Insertion[1]

For lack of space, part of the material, a statement by
Liebknecht, etc., has been held over.

Dear Friend,

I (and Nadezhda Konstantinovna) have had a letter
from Kollontai. We are going to reply to her.

My letters to you, I am sure, are being lost or delayed:
I have written more than once through Kobetsky. Inquire
once again.

We have received your manuscript, and intend to publish
it in the C.O. (or as a
pamphlet).[1]

Do you read Golos? It already shows signs of
Martov’s
turnabout[2]—Axelrod’s efforts to “reconcile” (Martov with
Südekum, i.e., Plekhanov)—and next to that Trotsky
“against” an “amnesty”!

What a mess! And they dare abuse us for “factionalism”
(while making peace with social-chauvinism for the sake of
factionalism!). An unpleasant and tiresome picture.

If you attend the
conference,[3] be on your guard. If
you do speak, I advise you to repeat your Stockholm speech,
adding that the entry of the Belgians and the French into
the government is also betrayal (even if with extenuating
circumstances). Otherwise they will think that out of 
Russian chauvinism we are abusing only the Germans.

In my opinion it is not worth while sending a report,
it should not be done.

What should be done, for information (only)—and on
behalf of Litvinov (Litvinoff. 76. High Street. 76.
Hampstead. London. N.W.)—is to send a full translation of the
manifesto and of the report of the arrest of the 5 (and the
11). I hope you have already had an exchange of letters
with Litvinov?

All good Wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

P.S. What did Kollontai think of the
“document”[4]
and the latest issues (80–86 and the following) of Golos?

P.S. I have just read that the conference is to take place
on January 17, and that the Swiss Party has refused. I think
that, if that is the case, it is better not to participate at all.

P.P.S. Kautsky, in the Labour Leader, is for the slogan
of
peace.[5] There is my reply to Comrade Kollontai! I
wonder if she will still be in favour of this watchword
now.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
An apparent reference to a report “Working-Class Petersburg
and the War (A St. Petersburg Worker’s Notes on the Early
Stages of the War)”, published in the magazine Kommunist
No. 1–2, 1915.





[2]
A reference to L. Martov’s letter to the Golos Editorial Board,
“About My Imaginary Solitude” (Golos No. 87, December 23,
1914). The letter and his report on “The War and the Crisis of
Socialism”, read in Berne on December 16, 1914, marked Martov’s
retreat from his stand in the early stages of the war.





[3]
A reference to the Conference of Socialists of Neutral Countries
held in Copenhagen on January 17 and 18, 1915, in which the
Social-Democratic parties of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and
Holland took part. Lenin was against the R.S.D.L.P. C.C.
sending an official representative to the Conference.





[4]
An apparent reference to the appeal of the St. Petersburg
liquidators: “To Minister Vandervelde, Belgium.”





[5]
A reference to a questionnaire in The Labour Leader No. 52,
December 24, 1914, on the question of peace, called “Peace
and Goodwill Shall yet Reign. Messages of Fraternity Across the
Battlefields”. =

January 3, 1915

Dear Friends,

Many thanks for your greetings, and from all of us also
(from Nadezhda Konstantinovna and me in particular) best
wishes for the new year!

A Paris compositor has offered to come to Geneva and
set the C.O. for 35 francs an issue, if we find a printing
press which will provide him with the
type.[1]

Discuss this from all points of view (reduction of expenses
is desirable, because we have decided to publish the C.O.
weekly) and reply as soon as you can.

Furthermore, consider also when the material should
be sent in, by what day everything should be ready and
for what day publication should be timed in the interests
of circulation. It would seem that the most convenient day
for circulation is Saturday. If so, should it be published on
Wednesday or Thursday? So that we should have it here on
Friday, and the whole of Switzerland by Saturday.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Central Committee Section Abroad did not have a printing
shop of its own, and the Central Organ was set up at a private
type-setting shop belonging to Lyakhotsky, an old Ukrainian
émigré (well known among political émigrés as Kuzma), and
printed in Geneva. Lyakhotsky’s type-setting shop was the only
one in Switzerland which had Russian type, and so catered for

   

various organisations. The setting of Sotsial-Demokrat became
extremely difficult in early 1915, when Borotba, a newspaper
of the Ukrainian nationalists, was also composed there. Kuzma
and Kuzmikha (his wife), who had great influence on her
husband, sympathised with Borotba. The problem was being
constantly discussed and this is reflected in Lenin’s and N. K.
Krupskaya s letters to V. A. Karpinsky and others. In early 1915,
Russian type was found in Benteli’s printing shop in Bumplitz
(near Berne) and a number of issues of Sotsial-Demokrat and
other material were printed there.

The suggestion to send a compositor from Paris apparently
came from G. Y. Belenky, but it was not implemented.

January 4, 1915

Dear Colleague,

I received your letter yesterday and sent a telegram
“consens”—agreed. However sad it is that the editors struck
out everything about socialism and tactics (without which
Marx is not Marx), I had to agree all the same, because your
argument (“absolutely impossible”) could not be
gainsaid.[1]

I shall be very grateful if you send me a proof, or drop
me a postcard about when it could be expected. By the
way, is there still time for some corrections to the section
on dialectics? Perhaps you will be so kind as to let me know
when it is being sent for setting, and what the deadline is
for corrections. It is a question I have been working on these
last six weeks, and I think I could add something if there
is still time.

Then I would like to offer my services to the editors of
the dictionary, if there are still any unallotted articles in
the volumes to be published. I am now in exceptionally
good conditions as regards German and French libraries,
to which I have access in Berne—and in exceptionally bad
conditions as regards literary work in general. Therefore I
would be very glad to take on articles on questions of
political economy, politics, the labour movement, philosophy,
etc. My wife has written on education, as N. Krupskaya, in
Russkaya Shkola and Svobodnoye
Vospitaniye,[2] and has
made a particular study of the question of the “Labour
School” and the old pedagogical classics. She would be glad
to undertake articles on these questions.

At your service,
 V. Ulyanov

Wl. Uljanow. Distelweg. 11. Bern.
 

Notes

The telegram was in reply to Granat Publishers, who had informed
Lenin that his article “Karl Marx (A Brief Biographical Sketch
with an Exposition of Marxism)”, written for, their Encyclopaedic
Dictionary, had to be abridged. The abridged article, signed
V. Ilyin, appeared in Vol. 28 of the Dictionary. The full text
was published in 1925 (see present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 43–91).

Russkaya Shkola (Russian School)—a pedagogical journal for
teachers and parents published and edited by Y. Gurevich from
1890 to 1918. Its No. 7–8 for 1911 carried N. K. Krupskaya’s
article “Co-education”.

Svobodnoye Vospitaniye (Liberal Education)—a pedagogical
monthly edited by I. Gorbunov-Posadov from 1907 to 1918. It
carried a number of Krupskaya’s articles on questions of teaching
and co-education.

Dear Friend,

We have once more decided (after having a talk
yesterday with Grimm, by the way) to advise you not to attend
the council of the heathen: let the liquidators attend the
Copenhagen conference, if they like. We should do better
not to take part at all.

Even the Swiss are not going.

This appears to be an intrigue of the Germans. I even
think that it involves an intrigue of the German General
Staff, who want to probe for “peace” through others.

We shall learn nothing there. Nothing much can be
done there. All we need is to send in the manifesto.

I am in a great hurry, so excuse the abruptness.

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Friend,

We are sending you notepaper with our stamp. But if
you must have it 
en tête,[1]

drop us a line, and we shall
order it at once at the printer’s.

I made inquiries about the deputies’ photographs
yesterday. They have already been ordered here, and will be ready
this week. We shall then send them on to
you.[3]

No. 36 is long since out, and has been sent you.

No. 37 is being printed.

The instructions about the number of copies to be sent
have been passed on.

I fully approve your plans on stamps for contributions,
etc., etc. Altogether, as regards your position, you will
already see in No. 36 that you are the official, fully
authorised representative of the C.C.; you were one before, and
you remain one still. I think this position is quite definite.
We see neither reason for, nor possibility of, changing it
now (until we have ascertained what’s going on in Russia).
I am absolutely convinced that you were writing sincerely,
en dehors de
toute,[2]

etc., and therefore hope that you will
write me just as sincerely, if there are nevertheless any
inconveniences, and what they are. Write frankly (to me
privately if you find it more convenient).

Golos has been closed down. The O.C.
people[4] are clearly
breaking up. In Zurich Martov was turned (by Axelrod+
Martynov+Semkovsky+the Bundists) to the right, towards
“peace” with the Plekhanovs and the Südekums. The

    

Bundists have issued No. 7 of their Information Bulletin; it
is colourless, totally for peace with the Südekums (
including Kautsky; in what way is he better than the Südekums?).

With all my heart I wish you success in your difficult
work, and am very thankful for your news. We have
received the Copenhagen resolutions.

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Friend,

Your plan for a trip in April and preparations for it seems
to be completely
correct.[1] You are right: that is the plan
to adopt and prepare as systematically and in as much
detail as possible.

Thank you for your letters. We have written to you
several times. We have also sent notepaper with our stamp.
I hope you have received all this.

Today we received an issue of Nashe Slovo, which has
begun to appear in Paris instead of Golos, which was closed
down. The issue of Nashe Slovo contains a statement by
Martov (and Dan) on their differences with Nasha Zarya.

Evidently, there is a big cleavage among them (the
liquidators), and no one can say what will happen. Axelrod
is clearly trying to “reconcile” the German (and Bundist)
chauvinists with the Francophiles (and Plekhanov). After
Zurich, Martov sang to Axelrod’s tune, but whether he
is now “gone left” for long, we don’t know.

In a few days we shall be issuing No. 37 of 
Sotsial-Demokrat.

All the best, and I wish you every success.

Yours,
 Lenin

Before April, we shall try (together with you) to organise
correspondence, and establish some contacts. You, too,
should make arrangements in good time.

                         INTRODUCTION

1. This year, the demonstration of the international
proletarian movement takes place during the greatest
European war.

2. Perhaps nothing can be done in 1915 for “a review
of forces”? for comparing “successes and defeats”? for
contrasting the bourgeois world and the proletarian world?—
since the appearance = all has collapsed.

3. But this is not so. War = the greatest possible crisis.
Every crisis means (with the possibility of temporary
retardation and regress)


   (α) acceleration of development
    (γ) (β) sharpening of contradictions
    (β) (γ) their exposure
    (δ) collapse of all that is rotten, etc.



That is the standpoint from which to consider the crisis
(on May Day): does it have any of the progressive, useful
features of any crisis?
COLLAPSE OF BOURGEOIS-NATIONAL FATHERLANDS

4. “Defence of fatherlands” and the actual nature of the
war. What is the essence? Nationalism versus imperialism.

5. 1789–1871 (about 100 years)...
    and 1905–?

6. “Defence of fatherlands” (Belgium? Galicia? Over the
division of the slaveowners’ spoils) 

versus “away with frontiers”. Collapse of national
fatherlands? Good riddance!
 

7. Imperialism old and new—Rome and Britain versus
Germany.


{

Seizure of territories
 Colonies
 Division of the world
 Export of capital

}



8. Maturity of the objective conditions for socialism.

9. How to defend the status quo?

How to carry on the revolutionary struggle for
socialism?

10. National freedom versus imperialism. The
proletariat of oppressor and oppressed nations.

11. “Internationalism” in the attitude to wars. ((“Which
bourgeoisie is better”? or independent action by the
proletariat?))

12. Back (to the national fatherland) or

forward (to the socialist revolution)?

[[

σ=
the collapse
of national
narrowness.

]]


COLLAPSE OF OFFICIAL
    SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTIES

13. Everyone feels (if he does not realise) the
turning-point in the history of the working-class movement. The
crisis and the collapse of the International. What is the
cause? Was the International united, or were there two
trends?

14. A review of attitudes to the war within the
working-class movement of the major countries:

Germany: August 4 versus Borchardt and Die
Internationale[10]

Britain:

France: (Guesde + Sembat versus Merrheim)

Russia:

 


(

Italy

Switzerland

[practice, two parties everywhere]

Sweden



15. What is the point? Compare the British and the
German labour movement = 

Bourgeois tendencies and influence in the labour
movement.

16. Fifteen years of struggle against opportunism, and
its growth in Western Europe. The collapse of opportunism
benefits the working-class movement.

((Guesde-Hyndman-Kautsky-Plekhanov.))

17. The crisis of official Marxism (1895–1915). Not to
resurrect the corpse, but to develop revolutionary Marxism
against opportunist “would-be Marxism”.

18. Marxism versus Struvism....

Dialectics versus eclecticism....

19. Torn banner? Stuttgart 1907

Chemnitz[1]

Kropotkine

(disillusionment)

«— 1MO



20. “All possibilities” except revolutionary action.

21. Anarchism =opportunism (petty-bourgeois). La
Bataille Syndicaliste

Cornelissen
Grave
Kropotkine



22. Abdankung der deutschen
Sozialdemokratie.[2]


Ineffectual organisations have broken up or, rather,
perished—to clear the ground for better ones. “Over-ripening”
(not that the proletariat has riot matured): compare 1907.
COLLAPSE OF PETTY-BOURGEOIS ILLUSIONS
     ABOUT CAPITALISM

23. The war is seen, on the one hand, as a single national
cause, and on the other, as an abnormality, a disruption
of “peaceful” capitalism, etc.
 

Both illusions are harmful. And the war tends to destroy
both illusions.

24. “
Burgfrieden”,[3]

the “national bloc”, “l’union
sacrée”[4]

during the war?

25. War is a “terrible” thing? Yes. But it is a terribly
profitable thing.

160,000 millions>60,000 million rubles.

Mehrwert[5]

 =10,000–20,000 million rubles.

26. “Adaptation” of industry to war conditions.
(Ruin. Rapid concentration.)

27. War and the pillars of capitalism.

“Peaceful democracy”, “culture”, “the rule of law”,
etc., versus the horrors of war?

Untrue.

Private property and exchange. The guarantee of ruin
for some, the guarantee and basis of violence:

28. Colonies and concessions.
“Honest concessionaire”?
“Humane” colonialist?

29. War = a terribly profitable thing = the direct and
inevitable product of capitalism.

30. Harmful illusions can only hinder the struggle against
capitalism.
COLLAPSE OF PACIFIST DREAMS

31. Capitalism without imperialism? (Shall we look back?)

32. Theoretically (in the abstract) it is possible even
without colonies, etc.

33. Just as with a 4–hour working day, 3,000 workers
minimum....

Ad 33: “Capitalism can develop without imperialism,
without wars, without colonies, with full freedom of trade.”

Is that true?

Capitalism can provide thousands of millions not for
war, but in aid of the paupers and the workers, thereby
perpetuating the domination of the capitalist class!
 

Theoretically identical propositions. “Compelling
pressure of the working class and humanitarian measures of
the bourgeoisie.” The whole point is that such things can
be compelled not by pressure in general; what is needed is
pressure with the force of a real revolution. And the
revolution and counter-revolution will sharpen the struggle to
something more essential.

The question boils down to a struggle for reforms. This
struggle is legitimate and necessary within definite limits,
viz.:

(1) absence of a revolutionary situation;
(2) partial
character of the reforms, not to sharpen the struggle of classes
to the point of revolution.

34. On account of what? On account of the horrors of
war? (And what about the terrible profits?)

On account of pressure from the proletariat? (And what
about the opportunists’ betrayal?)

35. Peace without annexations,

“Abolition of secret
disarmament, etc., etc.

diplomacy”?

Objective meaning:, clerical
consolations ((Feuerbach: religion consoles.

“Utopia or Hell”?

N.B. [The review
of Forel in Das
Volksrecht]

Is it useful?))


36. The struggle for reforms?
Yes.—Its limits.
Particulars.

An epoch of reforms, the absence of a revolutionary
situation.

This is the crux.
RESULTS OF THE COLLAPSE OF ILLUSIONS

37. Revolutionary situations

(α) the lower orders won’t, the upper classes can’t 

(&geta) growth of misery 

(γ) extraordinary activity.

38. Slow and tortuous development.

 Compare 1900 versus 1905.
 

39. Plunder by the capitalists
“
Kriegssklaverei”[6]

and deception by the governments?

40. The war and the marvels of technique?

41. The war and regrouping,

 (workers versus peasants)

42. Three mental attitudes

(α) despair and religion

(β) hatred of the enemy

(γ) hatred of capitalism, not only in general, but
of one’s own government and bourgeoisie.

43. The
“Gaponade”.[11]

44. Letter: “
Mundspitzen”[7]

(“Kamarades”)

45. Every crisis breaks some

££
and hardens others.

Collapse of what is
harmful, rotten in the
labour movement=
elimination of the
obstacles to
revolutionary battles.



46. Hardens—for the socialist

revolution (σσ).
PROFITS OF THE CAPITALISTS

By the way. The 10,000 million loan in Germany. The
loan will yield 5 per cent. The government has so arranged
things that the savings banks (for subscription to the loan)
receive funds from the loan offices (Darlehenskassen), paying
them 5.25 per cent. The loan offices get the money from the
government! A swindle. Das Volksrecht (Zurich), of April 
27,
1915.[12]

The absurdity of “amiable” utopias: without secret
diplomacy—we proclaim the aims of the war—peace without
annexations,, etc., etc. Sentimental and reactionary
rubbish.

The old nations (
respective,[8]

the bourgeois states)
versus “away with frontiers”!
 

The experience of Russia: 1900 versus 1905.

Down with the autocracy
  (1900) and the “people”....

Revolutionary slogans and the
  growth of the revolutionary
  movement....

Julian Borchardt’s group, Internationale Sozialisten Deutschlands
(International Socialists of Germany), together with the 
Internationale group (Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz
Mehring, Clara Zetkin and others) constituted the revolutionary
opposition among the German Social-Democrats and openly
opposed the war.





[11]
On the eve of the 1905 Russian revolution, the priest Gapon,
on assignment from the Okhranka (Secret Political Police), formed
an organisation, the Assembly of Russian Factory Workers,
with the aim of distracting the workers’ attention from
revolutionary struggle. On January 9 (22), 1905, Gapon provoked the
workers into marching to the Winter Palace to hand in a petition
to the tsar. On the tsar’s orders, the demonstrators were shot
down.

Volksrecht (People’s Right) No. 97, April 27, 1915, carried an
article, “Die Anleihenspirale” (Loan Spiral), which exposed
the financial machinations of Helferich (German Minister of
Finance) designed to ensure the success of the second 10–billion
war loan.

Werter
Genosse,[1]


Our letters evidently crossed. At the same time that
you were writing to me, I was writing (a postcard) to you
and sending you the 
Miscellany.[8] I hope you have received
it.

About a conference of the Left:

I have not been a member of the International Socialist
Bureau since 1912 (since 1912 Maximovich, in London, has
been the C.C.’s member of the I.S.B.). But, of course,
Grigory and I here will do everything necessary on behalf of
the C.C.

You write that “Grimm macht das [behind the backs of
the C.C.?] ohne
Absicht”[2]
[9]....



I wonder! Es scheint mir wenig glaubhaft zu sein. Ist
Grimm wirklich ein Kind? Nach zwei Konferenzen in
Bern?[3]
[10]


But you in Berne, of course, can see it more clearly, and
I should be glad if it turned out that I was wrong and you
were right.

And so, if Grimm macht das ohne Absicht, then the thing
is simple: Grimm must write to the C.C. (the official address
is printed in our C.O.—Bibliotheque russe. 7. Rue Hugo
de Senger. 7. Genève. Für das Kom.
Central[4]

).



(Of course, it is also possible to write to my address;
this will be more direct.)
 

Unless he does this, Grimm will be acting dishonestly
(for to write to Maximovich in London means losing time
and risking the letter falling into the wrong hands: the
police will intercept it!).

It is unbecoming for us to ask for an invitation: we don’t
want to force ourselves on them. We cannot do this!

Now on the substance of the question. You write:
“Da
wird Grimm und vielleicht [??sicher meines Erachtens!]
auch andere die Sache so abwechseln [nur? richtiger:
zertreten und verraten!] wollen, dass nur ein Aktionsprogramm
[soll heissen: Ermattungsprogramm, a programme of
abandoning the struggle, a programme of discouraging the
workers from revolution, a programme of pacifying the workers
with Leftist phrases] für die Stunde
kommt.”[5]


My opinion is that the “swing” by Kautsky+Bernstein
+Co. (+500+1,000+??) is a swing of shit (=Dreck),
who have sensed that the masses won’t stand for it any
longer, that it’s “necessary” to make a turn to the left, in
order to continue swindling the
masses.[11]

This is clear.

Renaudel in l’Humanité is also “going left”!

These shit-heads will get together and say that they
are “against the August 4 policy”, that they are “for peace”,
“against annexations” and... and ... thereby will help the
bourgeoisie to damp down the incipient revolutionary mood.

I conclude from your letter that you share my views.


Ergo[6]

,

our programme should be:

(1) to go if invited;

(2) to bring together beforehand the “Left”, i.e., the
supporters of revolutionary action against their own
governments;

(3) to put before the Kautskian shit-heads our draft
resolution (the
Dutch[12]+ourselves+the Left Germans
+0, and that won’t be too bad, for later it will be not
zero, but everyone!);
 

(4) to put forward 2 or 3 speakers at the conference (if
you manage to get there, this will be possible).

Would it be possible to get together a few German
Left-wingers against Kautsky and Co., for a programme of this
kind?

Write what you think of this programme. Its essence =
against the stupid and treacherous slogan of peace.

Come and see us!

Yours,
 Lenin

Is it not clear that the O.C. will side with
Drehscheibe[7]

—Kautsky

and Co.? Eh?

And are you sure that Grey+Bethmann-Hollweg have
not “tipped the wink” to Südekum+Vandervelde: time
to speak up for peace, chaps, or else there will be a
revolution?

P.S. In our hotel (Hotel Marienthal) we have a telephone
(No. 111). If you have anything urgent, ring up—at 8.30 
a.m. we are always at home.

P.P.S. Please read the enclosed and send it on.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Dear Comrade.—Ed.


Grimm is not doing this deliberately.—Ed.
[2]

[3]
I think this is highly unlikely. Is Grimm really a child?
After two conferences in Berne?—Ed.

[4]
For the Central Committee.—Ed.

[5]
In that case, Grimm and possibly (I think, surely) others as
well will want to try and turn things in such a way (only? more
likely: to suppress and betray!) that now only one programme of
action (rather: a programme of exhaustion...) will be put
forward.—Ed.

[6]
Hence.—Ed.

[7]
Turntable.—Ed.
 



[8]
An apparent reference to the miscellany, What Russia Expects
from the War, published by the Cadets.





[9]
Swiss Socialist R. Grimm, an organiser of the Zimmerwald
Conference, wanted to carry out preparations for the conference without
the Bolsheviks. Later he had to abandon his intentions and a
Bolshevik took part in the preliminary meeting on the
convocation of the conference.





[10]
The two conferences in Berne were: =

1) International Conference
of Socialist Women in March 1915 (see present edition, Vol. 21,
pp. 199–203); and =

2) International Socialist Youth Conference in
April 1915.





[11]
A reference to the “swing” of the Centrists from justifying the
war to struggling for peace. A call for peace and party unity “in
spite of differences of opinion”, i.e., in essence, unity with the
social-chauvinists, was expressed in the “manifesto” Das Gebot
der Stunde (Demand of the Time) signed by Karl Kautsky, Eduard
Bernstein and Hugo Haase and published in Leipziger
Volkszeitung No. 139, June 19, 1915.

Werter Genosse,

I enclose a letter about the
Vorkonferenz.[1]
[3]


Take a copy for
Lichtstrahlen[4]—or get Wijnkoop (if
you are sure that he is punctual) to send it on to them.

N.B. || 

All this is 
vertraulich.[2]

Promise not to speak about it,
either to Grimm or to Balabanova or to Trotsky or to anyone
else!

Read my letter to Wijnkoop and send it
off.[5] I hope
you have sent off the previous one! Let me know about this.

Either the German Left will now unite (if only for a
statement of principles on behalf of an anonymous
Stern[6]
group, or whatever you like: the workers will later join
this group), or we shall have to dismiss them from our
minds.

(I understand that Lichtstrahlen cannot act directly.
But why should not a Stern group, consisting of X+Y+Z,
come forward with resolutions or a manifesto? And then
privately and secretly distribute them?)

I don’t understand how you missed the Vorkonferenz
in Berne!? And you were the one who was exhorting me!?

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Do you find reading Russian difficult? Do you
understand everything?
 

P.S. Either send the Berne resolutions (the translation)
direct to Wijnkoop (if you have a copy), or send them here:
we shall make a
copy.[7]

It would be extremely important for us to have a private
consultation with some of the German Left. Could you
organise this? By the way, why not come over here?

Report of a delegate of the R.S.D.L.P. C.C. on the preliminary
meeting held at Berne on July 11, 1915, on the convocation of
an International Socialist Conference.

It was attended by representatives of the Social-Democratic
Party of Switzerland, the Italian Socialist Party, the Executive
of the Polish Social-Democratic Party and the P.S.P. Lewi&ctaila (
Left-wing), the Menshevik Organising Committee and the Central
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. The meeting decided on another
meeting which was to take the final decision on calling the
conference. The second meeting was not held.





[4]
Lichtstrahlen (Rays of Light)—a monthly of the group of
Left-wing Social-Democrats in Germany (Internationale Sozialisten
Deutschlands), published under the editorship of J. Borchardt.
It was issued irregularly in Berlin from 1913 to 1921.





[5]
See present edition, Vol. 35, pp. 195–97.





[6]
The Stern (Star) group was never set up. The Bremen Left-wing
Social-Democrats formed the Internationale Sozialisten
Deutschlands group.





[7]
A reference to the Conference of R.S.D.L.P. Groups Abroad
in Berne between February 27 and March 4, 1915, convened on
Lenin’s initiative. It had the significance of an all-Party
conference because it was impossible to call a congress or an all-Russia
conference during the war. The main item on its agenda was the
question of war and the Party’s tasks. Lenin gave the report.

Lenin also wrote all the main resolutions and the introduction
to them. They appeared in Sotsial-Demokrat and also as a
supplement to the pamphlet Socialism and War, which was published
in Russian and German. The resolutions of the Berne Conference
were also published in leaflet form in French and circulated among
the delegates to the Zimmerwald Socialist Conference and mailed
to Left-wing Social-Democrats in other countries.

Dear Comrade Radek,

I have received your letter to Wijnkoop, and am sending
it off by the first post. I am adding that work should be
started right away, if the idea is to prepare a declaration
(to say nothing of another Communist Manifesto).

We have provided (1) a manifesto; (2) resolutions; (3)
a draft
declaration.[3] So let us have your amendments
or counterdrafts as soon as possible. Hurry! Or we shall
be late!

I personally am against Nashe Slovo participating, but
would not make this an ultimatum. Why am I against?
(1) It is corruption, because Nashe Slovo has not itself
declared that it is an independent or third (apart from
the C.C. and O.C.) party or group for work in Russia;
(2)
There are 0.C. supporters in Nashe Slovo in numbers
unknown to the public. This is dual representation! (O.C.+
Nashe Slovo).
(3) Nashe Slovo is for the Chkheidze faction
in the Duma (and the O.C. and Plekhanov+Alexinsky are
also for it). Isn’t that corruption?

Taking Lichtstrahlen as a group, and considering it more
important than Zetkin’s, is not funny.

This group includes Borchardt+Radek+contributors to
Lichtstrahlen. That is enough.

This group has a little journal (while Zetkin and Co.
haven’t got one).

Borchardt was the first to say publicly: Die
Sozialdemokratie
abgedankt.[1]
[4]

That was not propaganda but a most
important political act. It was action, and not promise.
 

The most important thing for us (i.e., all the Left) is
a clear, complete, precise 
Prinzipienerklärung.[2]

Without
this all the so-called programmes of action are nothing
but talk and deception. What did the Zetkin “resolution
of action” in Berne come to? Nothing in terms of action!
Nothing in terms of
principle![5]

The Borchardt group, if it comes forward (together with
us or separately) as an anonymous group (Stern, or Pfeil,
or whatever) with a clear-cut Prinzipienerklärung+a call
to revolutionary action, will play an outstanding part in
world history.

Meanwhile, Zetkin and Co., having everything in their
hands (newspapers, journals, connections with Berner
Tagwacht, the opportunity of visiting Switzerland, etc.), have
done nothing in 10 months to unite the international Left.
This is a disgrace.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. I advise you not to enlist. It’s stupid to help the
enemy. You will be doing a service to the Scheidemanns.
Better emigrate. Really, that will be better. There is now
a desperate need of Left-wing workers.

“The opposition in Germany is the product of ferment
among the masses, whereas the Bolsheviks represent the
orientation of a little group of revolutionaries.”

That is not the Marxist approach.

It is Kautskianism—or a dodge.

What was the 1847 Communist Manifesto and its group?
The product of ferment among the masses? Or the
orientation of a little group of revolutionaries? Or both the one
and the other?

And what are we, the Central Committee? Or hasn’t
the R.S.D.L. Duma group proved that there are links with
the masses? And what about the Petrograd Proletarsky
Golos? Or is there no “ferment among the masses” in Russia?

The Left in Germany will make a historic mistake if,
on the pretext that they (they =Zetkin, Laufenberg,

    

Borchardt, Thalheimer, Duncker! Ha, ha!) are “the product
of ferment among the masses”, they refuse to come forward
with a Prinzipienerklärung (anonymously, on behalf of a
Stern group, etc. Later the workers will support it and
think about it).

There is need for a Left statement and programme so as
to develop the “ferment among the masses”. It is necessary
because of such ferment. It is necessary so as to transform
the “ferment” into a “movement”. It is necessary so as
to develop “ferment” in the rotten International.

And immediately!

You are quite, quite wrong!

P.S. You didn’t say clearly in your letter to Wijnkoop
whether it was set or proposed for August 20. Drop me
and Grigory a line about this (if it is urgent).

Rakovsky (see his
pamphlet)[6] is for defence of the
fatherland. To my mind, we should part company with
such people.

Dear V. K.,

I enclose the sheets of the pamphlet which were
accidentally overlooked. Please check whether you have everything
now. I wrote to you yesterday about the reprints coming
up for the pamphlet.


What about No. 44?

Regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. The attached footnote to the manifesto should go
into the pamphlet. Insert it, please.


Footnote. The demand for a United States of Europe,
as put forward in the manifesto of the C.C., which
supplemented it with a call for the overthrow of the
monarchies of Russia, Austria and Germany, differs from
the pacifist reading of this slogan by Kautsky and others.
[To the paragraph in the manifesto of the C.C. (No. 33
of Sotsial-Demokrat) containing a reference to the United
States of Europe.]


There is an editorial in No. 44 of our Party’s Central
Organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, which shows that the “United
States of Europe” slogan is economically wrong. Either
this is an impossible slogan under capitalism, one
signifying not only the giving up of colonies, but also the
establishment of a balanced world economy, with the colonies,
spheres of influence, etc., divided among the several
countries. Or else it is a reactionary slogan, signifying a
temporary alliance between the Great Powers of Europe to
plunder the more rapidly developing Japan and America.
(Note by the editorial board of Sotsial-Demokrat.)

Return the material as soon as possible!

Dear Comrade Olga,

I am afraid to write to V. K., because “hurry-up” letters
make his nervous illness even worse. But what is happening
to No. 44? Or has the Kuzmikha woman turned definitely
against us? I was in a terrible hurry to get No. 44 finished,
had no time to correct the articles, didn’t see the proofs—
and there it is—stuck. And Kuzma was demanding the
pamphlet by the week before
last![1]

Drop me a line, please, whether there is any hope of
issuing both 44 and the pamphlet. When will the one and the
other be ready? There’s need to add to and amend a few
things in the pamphlet. It’s essential to have proofs.

Greetings to V. K.

Yours,
 V. Ulyanov

P.S. How do you like Peuple? Solid for Vandervelde!

Dear Comrade Olga,

Hurrah! You’ve beaten Kuzmikha herself! Well, you’re
really a heroine!

I enclose the proofs and two insertions for the pamphlet.
Please make sure that they are inserted in the right place.
(If there is any delay, don’t send me the proofs of these
insertions, but handle them yourself.)

I am writing to Grigory that I am publishing the
pamphlet (he can phone me if there are any differences).

There should be three supplements at the end of the
pamphlet:

I. The manifesto of the C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. on the
war (from No. 33. I am enclosing it).


(

Insert footnote (on the United States slogan) which
I sent you (and did you send a copy to Lyalin?).

II. The resolution from No. 40 which I am
sending.[2]

III. The 1915 resolution (the conference of the C.C. with
Party workers) on the national
question.[3] I haven’t got
it. I am asking them to send it to you from Berne. (But
there must be one at your library.)

Print the pamphlet in 2,000 copies on the cheapest paper
(if you have thin paper, then 1,000 copies on that), in the
cheapest possible format, convenient for envelopes.


Salut,[1]

Yours,
 Lenin
 

P.S. If you can do this without delay, send me a second
copy of all proofs of the pamphlet (to send to a comrade
who is leaving for Russia).

Dear A. M.,

The Vorkonferenz (II) has been postponed until
Sept. 5.[1]

Höglund and the Left Norwegians (and what about the
Danes?) must procure an invitation themselves. They should
send their statements, requests and declarations to us (for
the C.C.) in writing, signed and stamped, in one of the
three international languages.

Very warm regards to Alexander (why is he only
criticising my
draft?[2] Let’s have your amendments, s’il vous
plaît!)—and to you for your successful work among the Left
in Scandinavia.

Yours,
 Lenin

I think it is hardly likely that the conference will
materialise soon, if at all. However, let Höglund prepare, seriously
and urgently.

But are they willing to have a joint manifesto with us
on behalf of the Left in the various countries (independently
of the conference)?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Instead of a second preliminary meeting at Zimmerwald, the
conference proper was held there from September 5 to 8, 1915.
It was the scene of a struggle between revolutionary
internationalists led by Lenin, and the Kautskyite majority. Lenin organised
his supporters into the Zimmerwald Left, a group in which the
Bolshevik Party was alone in consistently following a correct and
internationalist line against the war.

The conference adopted a manifesto, which declared the war
to be imperialist, condemned the behaviour of the “socialists”
who voted for the war credits and took part in bourgeois
governments, and called on the workers of Europe to campaign against
the war, for a peace without indemnities and annexations.

The conference also adopted a resolution expressing sympathy
with the victims of war and elected an International Socialist
Commission (I.S.K).

On the significance of the Zimmerwald Conference, see Lenin’s
“The First Step” and “Revolutionary Marxists at the
International Socialist Conference, Sept. 5–8, 1915” (present edition,
Vol. 21, pp. 383–88 and 389–93).

Dear Kasparov,

There is to be a conference of the Left in Berne on
Sept. 5.[1]

It would be extremely important to have our pamphlet
in German appear before that
date.[2]

Can you help in this?

—first, by calling on Radek, helping him to read the
manuscript and inciting him to sit down and do the
translation (unfortunately, we shall not manage to have the
Russian proofs before then);

—second, by seeing to the contract with the German
printing house (Radek knows what this is about);

—third, by calling on Kinkel, showing him this letter
and asking him to help with the translation (to take on part
of it).

I know that Kinkel almost hates me for my translation
requests. But this is an emergency, the matter is important,
we need urgent help, and maybe he won’t be too angry.

Drop me a reply by postcard as quickly as you can.

All kinds of regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Many thanks for the credential

you don’t mind, send me immediately the same in French
or in German, with a stamp on it, etc., in due form, and
particularly with an addition in the text of the credential
to the effect that not only has your party always been (and
is) affiliated to the International Socialist Bureau (but has
a delegate on it with a consultative vote). This is very urgent.

Best regards,

P.S. If you have received from us a manuscript draft
of a brief declaration in
Russian,[2] please pass it on to
Litvinov as soon as you can, with a request to translate it into

Dear A. M.,

It turns out that it is not the Vorkonferenz but the
conference itself that is to take place on Sept. 5. So there is
no time to lose.

You should strain every effort to try and send Höglund
here, or the most Leftist and most reliable Norwegian, so
that they should be here for certain not later than Sept. 3.
(They should telephone me from Berne at Sörenberg, Hotel
Marienthal (Kanton Lüzern), telephone 1.11—(1.11)).

If it is absolutely impossible for any of them to come,
let them at once (so that I should have it for certain on
Sept. 2 or 3) send by registered letter either a transfer of
credential to our C.C. (a, formal credential, in German or
French)—or (if they are not agreeable to handing over
their credential) their statement that they are in solidarity
with the C.C. + their Prinzipienerklärung + (without fail) a
letter to the conference authorising our C.C. to read it out
(
respective[1]

put it to the vote, if possible).

The crux of the struggle will be, whether to proclaim,
in the Prinzipienerklärung, a ruthless struggle (up to and
including a split) against opportunism = social-chauvinism.
Secure the maximum possible clarity and firmness of
formulation on this very point.

Write me a postcard at once whether you have received
this letter, and whether you hope (or are sure?) that
such-and-such will be done.

(Regards to Alexander!)

Salut,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade,

I wrote to you the other day about Golay. Things are
now going forward from the other side, so to speak. It is
not a preliminary conference, but an international
conference of the Left that has been set for Sept. 5. Merrheim
will be there from Paris (all this is entre nous, of course).
The Nashe Slovo people will attend. Why should not Golay
and Naine be there as representatives of Left-wing
socialism in French Switzerland (since Grimm, who is much more
half-and-half than Naine and Golay, will be
attending)?[2]
Please, try and see both as soon as possible, have a good
heart-to-heart talk with them, and drop me a line in reply,
as soon as you can, about the frame of mind of both these
Leftist Frenchmen. You realise, of course, that it is 
anti-chauvinist Frenchmen who would just now—especially in
the presence of Merrheim—be of particular importance
at the conference.

So, hurry with your reply!

Regards to Rivlin.

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Alexandra Mikhailovna,

It will be a great pity if your trip to America finally falls
through. We pinned many hopes on this visit: for the
publication in the U.S.A. of our booklet (Socialism and War,
which you will receive in a few days), for connections with
the publisher Charles H.
Kerr[1] in Chicago in general,
for mobilising the internationalists and lastly for the
financial help which we so badly need for all those vital affairs
in Russia of which you write (and justly emphasise their
urgency, in view of the desirability of our coming closer to
Russia. The obstacles there are chiefly financial, and also
of a police nature; can one get there safely?).

If the question of a trip has been finally decided in the
negative sense, try and think over whether you could (through
connections with Charles H. Kerr, etc.) help us to publish
our booklet in English? This can be done only in America.
We are sending you the German edition of our booklet. Do
everything you can for its sale in the Scandinavian
countries (it is terribly important for us to cover some of the
expenses at least, otherwise we cannot publish it in
French!).

Write in greater detail, more concretely and more
frequently (if you are not going to America) about the practical
questions arising in Russia, who is raising them, how, on
what occasions and in what circumstances. All this is of
extreme importance for the publication of leaflets—a vital
question, as you rightly say. About the conference of the
Left (where we rallied well as an opposition, although we
did sign the manifesto) you will be partly informed by the

    

delegate you
sent,[2] and partly we shall later tell you in
writing.

(We are very short of cash! That is the main trouble!)

Best regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear G. L.,

Please send me as soon as you can three copies each of
the German
booklet[1] and the French
resolutions.[2]
(What is the bill? And is there any hope of cutting it down?
Are you concluding a contract for the sale of the German
booklet in Switzerland? Drop me a line.)

Please, send 10 copies of the German booklet and 2 sets
of the French resolutions to the following address: Fru
A. Kollontay. Turisthotel. Holmenkollen. Kristiania.
Norwegen. (Let me know when they have been sent.)

Please hurry up Radek to send me a copy of the officially
adopted
manifesto.[3] It is very urgent. Call on Radek
once or twice and get it done, please. You should also have
a talk with him (and not only have a talk, but go about
it in a business-like way, worry him, have it done, check it
up) about the sale of the German booklet in Switzerland.
You should get hold of the addresses of German workers’
societies and clubs in various towns (including Geneva),
find contacts, write and make sure something has been done.
All that is your job. Please, go about it as vigorously as
you can.

Regards,
 Yours,

Dear V. K.,

I was away on business for a few days (and only for that
period did I ask that everything should be sent to Geneva;
now please send everything again—including the booklet—
to Sörenberg).

On my arrival I found your letter about Rolland’s
articles.[1] I am terribly worried about your not having received
them. I sent them to you by letter post two weeks ago, if
not more. I have not had any cases before this of
unregistered letters being lost in Switzerland. Could there be some
mistake? Perhaps someone has received these articles in
your absence? Write about this, please. If the answer is that
there was not, and could not have been any mistake, and
if you do not have the articles, I will naturally do
everything possible to get them for you (if I have lost them).
I shall either buy this issue, or (if it has been sold out) get
it from the library and make a complete copy for you. I am
very sorry, and please write to me as soon as possible how
matters stand. If you require a copy, how soon? Write
frankly.

Regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

For some reason I have stopped receiving Zhizn. Is there
no exchange? Would you make an inquiry? And what about
Vperyod[2]? What news is there of the O.C.
miscellany[3]
and the Bund publications? Kommunist No. 1–2 has
appeared.[4] This is a fact.
 

Notes

A reference to Romain Holland’s articles in Journal de

up the re-issue of these articles, and they were published only
in 1915 in the collection, Romain Rolland, Au-dessus de la m&ehatlée.
Paris. Paul Ollendorff; Neuch&ahattel, Attinger Frères, 1915.





[2]
Vperyod (Forward)—a periodical of the Vperyod group, published
in Geneva from August 25,1915 (No. 1) to February 1,1917 (No. 6).
Among those who took part in the publication were A. V.
Lunacharsky (A. Voinov), P. I. Lebedev (V. Polyansky), and
D. Z. Manuilsky (I. Bezrabotny).





[3]
A reference to the miscellany The International and the War
No. 1, issued by the Secretariat Abroad of the Organising
Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. in 1915.





[4]
The magazine Kommunist was founded by Lenin and published
by the editorial board of Sotsial-Demokrat jointly with G. L.
Pyatakov and Yevgenia Bosch, who financed the publication. N. I.
Bukharin was also on the editorial board. Only one (double) issue
appeared. It carried Lenin’s articles “The Collapse of the Second
International”, “The Voice of an Honest French Socialist”, and
“Imperialism and Socialism in Italy”.

Lenin expected to turn the magazine into an organ of the
Left-wing Social-Democrats, but serious differences soon developed
between the Sotsial-Demokrat Editorial Board and Bukharin,
Pyatakov and Bosch, which were aggravated after the appearance
of the first issue.

Dear Radek,

The letter to Wijnkoop has been sent.

Also the report with your letter to Grigory.

You probably have no copy of our statement (that we
are dissatisfied with the manifesto, that it does not go far
enough, etc.)? We handed it in to the Bureau, and Grimm
read it out. We must absolutely have a copy of this statement.
Would Grimm let you make a copy? If not, we’re stuck!

P.S. And Grimm’s “conspirative methods” too! The whole
world already knows everything! And these stupid Italians
in Avanti!. What a
shame![1]

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes

Avanti! (Forward!)—a daily, the central organ of the Italian
Socialist Party, founded in Rome in December 1896. Its No. 260
of September 19, 1915 carried an item, entitled “Il convegno
Internationale di Zimmerwald” (International Conference at
Zimmerwald), which, contrary to the secrecy agreed upon, gave all
the particulars of the organisation of the conference and even
carried a number of photographs of the house where it was held.

Dear Radek,

Many thanks for the manifesto and
report.[1]

(1) Could we have gratis 20 copies of this issue of Berner
Tagwacht, to send to our Party groups?

(2) In the manifesto, the words “revolutionary
proletarian class struggle” have been replaced by the word
“irreconcilable”. Is that loyal on Grimm’s part?

(3) The report does not say that a part (one-tenth) of
the German delegation (and one-third of the Swiss) signed
our draft resolution.

Is that loyal on Grimm’s part?

Your opinion, please: ought we not officially to write
to Grimm about this?

(4) Does Grimm guarantee that in the detailed report
(the minutes of the sessions) our draft and our statement
will be included in full?

Yes or no?

(5) There are many inaccuracies in the report, and not
a word about the voting (on our draft)!

The question of a split and of the dissolution of this
Bureau (Grimm and Co.) was not voted
on.[2]

We must do something.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Please, send me our draft and our
statement.[3]

Grimm does not say a word about our
booklet[4] (=
report)! What a rogue!

September 19, 1915

Dear Comrade,

I should like to give a lecture in Zurich about the middle
of October on “The International Conference of September
5--8,
1915”.[1] If the subject is suitable, and can yield even
a small return, let me know. (I am also writing to Geneva
about this; we must agree beforehand about the dates. I am
asking them in Geneva to have posters printed for both
occasions, leaving out the town and the date.) Let me know
your opinion as soon as you can.

By the way. Will you send me Axelrod’s German
pamphlet on the tasks of international
Social-Democracy,[2]
which appeared in Zurich recently? I am curious to have a
look at it.

(We shall publish a report on the conference in the C.O.—
and then Nashe Slovo and the Socialist-Revolutionaries,
etc., etc., will follow. But I shall deal with it in greater
detail than in the press, and shall make an assessment and
draw the conclusions.)

Best regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

September 19

Dear Alexander,

We have received your letters telling us about the good
working of the transport arrangements, and were
extremely glad of them. As regards the literature at Vardö,
try to get hold of and save everything: send us the files of
Proletary and Vperyod; we can also make use of the pamphlets
(the old ones, of 1905); it will be worth while sending them
to Russia, now that there is a possibility of transport in
general.[2]

Yesterday I read in the foreign press the news of the “
dispersal ” of the Duma. It is clear that the reactionaries are
either frightened by the bloc of the Left, or are banking
on some “military” chances (perhaps a separate peace?).
Our attitude to the chauvinist revolutionaries (like
Kerensky and part of the Social-Democrat liquidators or patriots)
cannot, in my opinion, be expressed by the formula of “
support”. The gulf between the chauvinist revolutionaries
(revolution for victory over Germany) and the proletarian
internationalist revolutionaries (revolution to awaken the
proletariat of other countries, to unite it in a general
proletarian revolution) is too wide for there to be any question
of support. We must utilise every protest (even a timid
and muddled one, à la Gorky), we shall utilise the
revolutionary work of the chauvinists too, and depending on the
circumstances shall not reject “joint action” (in keeping
with our Party’s resolutions adopted in 1907, at the
London Congress, and in 1913, at our
conference),[3] but
nothing beyond that. At the moment, in practice: we shall not
issue joint appeals and manifestos with the revolutionary

    

patriots, we shall avoid Duma “blocs” with them, avoid
“unity” with them when speaking at congresses, during
demonstrations and the like. But technical mutual services,
if the patriots go along, will probably be possible (as with
the liberals before 1905), and we shall not reject them. Our
relations must be straightforward and clear-cut: you want
to overthrow tsarism for victory over Germany, we want
to do so for the international revolution of the proletariat.

We have incredibly little information from Russia. It is
simply a shame that such a comparatively simple business
as conspirative correspondence with Russia (fully possible
even in wartime) turns out to be so very badly organised.
This is one of the most essential things. (I hope you have
had a detailed discussion of this with Nadezhda
Konstantinovna in your letters, and will do so yet as circumstantially
as possible.) The most vital thing is to establish regular
contact, to bring over from Russia at least two or three
leading workers, if only to Sweden, for the most detailed
talks and correspondence, in order to reach complete
“harmony”. I hope Belenin’s visit will bring a marked
improvement in this sphere. To do the round trip fast, to
establish new connections, to collect the news—that is now
the key to the whole of our work, and without it it’s no
use even looking to the
future.[4]

We are thinking over a plan to publish manifestos and
leaflets for transportation to Russia. We have not yet
decided where they are to be published, here or in the
Scandinavian countries. We should select the cheapest alternative,
because the distance does not
matter.[1]


With all my best wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin

During his trip to arrange the transportation of Bolshevik
literature to Russia, A. G. Shlyapnikov discovered in Vardö (a port
in the north of Norway) a stock of literature left over from 1906
and 1907, when the illegal shipping arrangements were
disrupted. It included sets of the Bolshevik newspapers Vperyod and
Proletary, and various pamphlets. A part of this literature was
sent to Russia on Lenin’s instructions.

Dear Radek,

Thanks for the
bulletin.[1]

We shall discuss the money question with Grigory. We’re
hard up just now!

But the most important thing is: why are you silent about
our (your final) draft
resolution[2]? I must have it at once
(and our statement on the voting for the manifesto)!

You should have a copy! Why don’t you send it to me?

Or Grimm? Can he really be refusing to let you make
a copy? Please reply.

Grimm’s “loyalty” is only so much talk. He has
deliberately failed to mention Borchardt—it’s a
disgrace.[3]

Regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Alexander,

It is a very good thing that you are undertaking to handle
the
leaflets.[1] We are drawing up a detailed plan for them,
and will soon be sending it to you and to N. I. But you
know it is still most desirable that N.I. should write the
leaflets in two copies simultaneously (with a copying-pencil
over carbon paper), and that you (or he himself) should
send us the second copy at once. For leaflets are a very
responsible thing, and the most difficult of all forms of
literature. It is essential therefore to give them most careful
thought, and to have collective consultations. In view of
the slowness of setting up, printing and transport, the time
lost on dispatch here will be relatively small, and, in any
case, does not matter in comparison with the importance
of well-thought-out appeals.

How do you plan to sign the leaflets? You have forgotten
to write about this.

Kollontai’s pamphlet has a good underlying idea. But
the subject is exceptionally difficult; it is extremely hard
to present it on this popular level. I think it needs
correcting. I have already written to her about this, asking her to
agree to these
corrections.[2] If she does, things will go
ahead very quickly, for I have already prepared a draft
of the corrections.

As regards a visit to your
country,[3] there is a hitch,
first, because of lack of finance (the fare is high, and the
cost of living there) and, second, because of the dubious
police situation. We shall rather await Belenin’s return
and his news of home.

Every good wish,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear G. L.,

I simply cannot understand what’s happening to Radek.
I have asked him repeatedly for:

(1) a copy of our (i.e., the C.C.+Letts+P.S.D.+Swedes+
Norwegians+Borchardt+Platten) draft resolution (in
German)[1];

(2) a copy of our (the same groups’) statement at the
conference on the voting (why we, though not in agreement
with the manifesto, vote for);

(3) a copy of our (the same groups+Roland-Holst)
statement of protest against Ledebour’s
ultimatum.[2]

Radek does not reply!

And I must have them for the Central Organ.

Please, do call on him and find out what’s wrong. (If
Radek hasn’t got them, can Grimm really be refusing to
have a copy made? That would be the height of impudence!)

Regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

A statement on Ledebour’s peremptory demand that the
Conference should not pass a resolution prohibiting organisations
attending the Conference from voting for war credits (he said the

   

question should be decided on the strength of each country’s
strategic position). The statement was quoted in Sotsial-Demokrat
No. 47, October 13, 1915 (“Two Statements at the International
Conference”).

Dear Comrade,

I received the proofs today (the last ones, I think), and
we are sending them off this very day. The instruction
on the order of the articles has already been sent, so that
I hope the double issue (price 20 centimes) will soon be
out. Let me know when exactly.

I am sending this express for the following urgent
reason: very important (and favourable) news has been
received from Russia. We want to publish another (two-page)
issue of the C.O. right away, to appear really at once.
If, contrary to all expectations, it is possible to guarantee
this time that Kuzma and Kuzmikha will honour their
promise (i.e., will set about it at once, and bring it out
without the least delay), telegraph: “garanti”. If not (which
is of course much more probable, because we know how
unreliable Kuzma is in spite of your efforts), then telegraph
(Seidenweg. 4a)
“non”.[1]

I shall write tomorrow about the lecture.

Salut,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to Sotsial-Demokrat No. 47, which was issued on
October 13 (two days after the double issue, No. 45–46) and which
dealt almost entirely with the state of Social-Democratic work
in Petrograd and Moscow. It also carried Lenin’s “Several Theses
Proposed by the Editors”, dealing with topical issues of
Social-Democratic work in Russia (see present edition, Vol. 21,
pp. 401–04).

The gist of Karpinsky’s reply is not known but it appears to
be negative, because Sotsial-Demokrat No. 47 was not printed
by Kuzma, but by Benteli in Bumplitz.

November 22, 1915

Dear Alexandra Mikhailovna,

I failed to finish the letter I sent you today out of sheer
absent-mindedness. This is the address: Mr. C. W.
Fitzgerald, Secretary of the Socialist Propaganda
League[1]

20. Baker Street. Beverly. Mass.

I was mistaken, therefore, when I said that he lives in
Boston. But his sheet contains the addresses of all 18 
members of the League, and among them some living in Boston.
I hope you will make every effort to find out everything
you can about them, and will try to build up out of them
(either including them, or out of some of them) one of the
rallying-points for the Zimmerwald Left in America.

Every good wish,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Friends,

I am sending you leaflet
No. 1.[1]

Help us to distribute it.

The address of the publisher is on the leaflet (rub it off
after making a copy). Tell the Frenchmen, Guilbeaux and
others, about it.

How is the Swiss referendum going? Is there any response
(in Geneva) to the struggle between the opponents and
supporters of “defence of the
fatherland”?[2]

Best regards and wishes,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
This may be a reference to Internationale Flugblätter No. 1,
issued in November 1915, and carrying F. Platten’s Zurich
address. On the strength of this, Lenin’s letter in the Fourth
Edition of his Sobraniya Sochineny (Collected Works) is dated
“late November-early December 1915”.

But it is also possible that Lenin was referring to the leaflet
Gegen die Lüge der Vaterlandsverteidigung (Against the Lies of
Defence of the Fatherland) No. 1, which was issued in February
1917, and signed by “a group of Zimmerwald Left-wingers in
Switzerland”. This leaflet bears no publisher’s address, which
warrants the assumption that Lenin’s letter might have been
written in February 1917.





[2]
A possible reference to the struggle between the Left and the
Centrists at the Aarau Congress of the Social-Democratic Party of
Switzerland on November 20–21, 1915, or the referendum on the
calling of an extraordinary Party congress announced by the Swiss
Left-wing Social-Democrats in January 1917.

Dear Comrade Olga,

Forgive me for writing on this scrap of paper.

It seems to me that you acted correctly. Indeed, unless
there is a break with Nashe Dyelo, all the rest is deception.
This is clearer than ever, now that the O.C. informers,
in alliance with the reactionaries, have “won” in Petrograd
(by rigging the
election).[2]

Add to the resolution condemnation of the rigged second
election.[3] And to the preamble, the impermissibility
of taking part in “defence”, once the war is of an
imperialist, i.e., annexationist, i.e., plundering, i.e.,
oppressive, nature (in general, I advise drawing up the preamble
as carefully as possible, on the basis of Sotsial-Demokrat,
selecting the arguments from the relevant articles and
resolutions of the Petrograd workers).

We shall pass on the letter to Inessa.

All the best, and regards to everyone.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. One request: Inessa tells us that there is a girl
in Geneva who used to live in 
Arras.[1]

You know her. We
are told that she has a good command of French. Will
she undertake to translate from German into French (for
Roland-Holst’s magazine, published here with our
participation[4])? Free of charge or for a fee? How much? Find
out, please.
 

Notes

A reference to the second election of representatives from the
workers to the war industries committees (central and regional).
The social-chauvinists were defeated at the first election on
September 27 (O.S.), 1915, when the Bolsheviks carried through
their resolution to the effect that it was impermissible for
representatives of the proletariat to take part in “organisations which
in anyway promoted the present war”. With the help of the
bourgeoisie, the social-chauvinists launched a successful campaign
to nullify the first election. At the second election held on
November 29 (O.S.), 1915, the Bolsheviks read out a statement
censuring the actions of the defencists and walked out. In this
way, the defencists, with the aid of the bourgeoisie, managed to
elect 10 of their men to the “workers’ group” from among the
Mensheviks and S.R.s.

K. Radek, H. Gorter and D. Wijnkoop. The magazine carried
Lenin’s “Opportunism and the Collapse of the Second
International ” and “The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations
to Self-Determination (Theses)” (see present edition, Vol. 22,
pp. 108–20 and 143–56).

Dear Comrade,

Comrade Radek has just shown us Comrade Pannekoek’s
letter and the “Introduction”.

This letter and the “Introduction” substantially change
the previously adopted constitution of
Vorbote.[2] It had
been agreed that Vorbote would appear as the organ of
two groups, namely,
(1) the Roland-Holst and Trotsky
group (or Roland-Holst and her friends without Trotsky,
if Trotsky is unwilling to join);
(2) the Zimmerwald Left
group (whose bureau consists of three comrades: Radek,
Lenin and Zinoviev). Comrade Pannekoek was appointed
representative of the latter group.

Now the above-mentioned documents (the letter and
the “Introduction”) change the constitution: Vorbote
appears as the organ of two comrades, Pannekoek and
Roland-Holst.

If Comrades Pannekoek and Roland-Holst have decided
to make this change, we take note of it. The owner of
Vorbote had the full right to do so.

We do not refuse to co-operate in these new conditions,
but must require certain guarantees. Vorbote appears for
the first time as the organ of the Zimmerwald Left or “on
the platform of the Zimmerwald Left”. We were elected
representatives of that Left by all the members of the
Zimmerwald Left attending at Zimmerwald (except
Platten). We think therefore—and in this respect we have all
three come to a unanimous decision—that this guarantee
is self-evident, and will undoubtedly be given by you.

 

The guarantee consists in this, that if there are any
differences of principle among us, the article which ... by the
Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. (representative ...),
the editorial
board. ...[1]

 

Notes
 

[1]
The manuscript breaks off at this point.—Ed.
 



[2]
The changes in the constitution boiled down to the representatives
of the Zimmerwald Left being invited to work in Vorbote not as
editors, as had been planned earlier, but us contributors (see
pp. 394–95).

Dear Comrade,

I should very much like to go to Zurich for two or three
weeks to work in the libraries on a piece of
research.[1]
My wife also. So far we have no papers, but hope soon to
get them. The question is whether we shall be able to overcome
the financial difficulties. I would very much ask you to reply
frankly and without exaggeration to the following questions:

(1) What net income can there be (i.e., for me) from a
lecture? Minimum and maximum? The subject: “Two
Internationals”: the growing division and rupture with
the social-chauvinists throughout the world. Is it possible
to increase the income by giving two lectures, and by how
much?[2]
(2) Will the local comrades help the two of us
to get cheap accommodation?
(3) How much will it cost
to have a room (for two, even if with a single bed) per
week? The cheapest, preferably in a worker’s family?
(4)
Dinner in a canteen, if there is one (here we pay 65 centimes
in a students’ canteen)?
(5) Morgenkafee and coffee in the
evening, because, of course, we cannot do our own
housekeeping in Zurich?

The cost of the journey will be 7x4=28 francs; extra
expenditure on living in another town? That is the question.
The room situation here is bad. Do you happen to know a
worker’s family which could reliably promise to put us up
cheap?

I shall be very grateful for a frank reply, but without
any wild promises.

Beste Grüsse,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Are there any cheap self-service food counters
or the like, and what are the prices?

Dear Comrade,

I am very grateful for your speedy and detailed reply.
We shall be there on February 4. If you can, find us a room
for two, by the week, not dearer than 1 franc a day;
preferably in an ordinary working-class family (with a stove;
it may still be cold).

If this is impossible, perhaps you will recommend a
cheap hotel (1 franc a day, or even cheaper), where we
could stay until we found a room ourselves. We shall agree
on the date of the lecture, etc.

I hope to have a money order from you on Monday
morning (keep a special account of the expenses: the express
and the like, and postal expenses generally, etc., because
we shall cover them ourselves).

Beste Grüsse,
 Yours,
 Lenin

For A. M. Gorky

Dear Alexei Maximovich,

I am sending you under registered cover my wife’s
booklet, Public Education and
Democracy.[1]

The author has long been studying educational questions,
over twenty years. The booklet is based both on her
personal observations and on material about new educational
developments in Europe and America. From the contents
you will see that the first half also contains a sketch of
the history of democratic views. This is also very
important, because the views of the great democrats of the past
are usually set forth wrongly, or from the wrong
standpoint. I don’t know whether you are able yourself to take
time off to read it, or whether you are interested; §§ 2 and
12 could serve as an example. Changes in education in
the latest, imperialist, epoch are sketched out on the basis
of material of recent years, and shed some very interesting
light on the question for the democrats in Russia.

You will do me a great favour by helping—directly or
indirectly—to publish this booklet. The demand in
Russia for literature in this sphere has now probably greatly
increased.

Best regards and wishes,
 V. Ulyanov

Wl. Uljanow. Seidenweg. 4a. Bern.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

N. K. Krupskaya’s book Public Education and Democracy was
not published by Parus, as had been planned, and was only
issued in 1917 by the Zhizn i Znaniye Publishers.

Dear Comrade,

Here is our new
address.[1] Send everything to it, please.
We have taken the premises for a month. On Thursday
(Feb. 17) I am giving the first lecture here (“Two
Internationals”), and after a while, the second (“Conditions of
Peace and the National Question”, or something of that
kind).

Please write and tell me when it will be possible to give
a lecture (the first, or both?) in Geneva, and whether the
cost can be covered. How much will it yield net, as a
minimum? I have to know this, because I am very short of
money, and I must calculate as carefully as possible
whether I should travel from here (at greater expense) or later
on from Berne (I can stay more than a month here, if I like
it). I shall await detailed and authoritative instructions
from you. Perhaps you would drop a line to Lausanne,
too, to find out whether it is worth while going there for
an evening?

Best wishes, and regards to V. K. and all our friends.

Yours,
 V. U.

Nadya sends warm greetings.

Dear Comrade,

Many thanks for the detailed information.

I am busy here on February 25 and 26.

So will you please fix the day for the lecture yourself,
either before the 25th or after the 26th, and let me know
beforehand?[1] I would also ask you very much to write
to Lausanne, so that I could have done with the lot in
2 days, i.e., lecture in Lausanne either on the evening before
Geneva, or on the day after Geneva.

I accept the subject: “‘Conditions of Peace’ (in
quotation marks) and the National Question”. So this is the
agreed subject. All the best. Regards to V. K. and all our
friends.

Yours,
 Lenin

There is a convenient train: it arrives in Geneva at
9.15 p.m. Is it all right if I come by this train? If not,
then can I lecture in Lausanne the evening before? Please!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In Geneva, Lenin read a lecture, “‘Conditions of Peace’ in
Connection with the National Question”, on March 1, 1916. It was
attended by 200 persons. The Institute of Marxism-Leninism
of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee has no information on the
lecture at Lausanne.

Dear V. K.,

May I trouble you with the following request? I should
like to have for my lecture the issue of the Paris Golos
(Nashe Slovo’s predecessor) in which Semkovsky replied
to me on the question of the self-determination of nations,
and in one footnote (I remember that it was a footnote)
dealt particularly with the comparison between the right
of nations to secede and the right of divorce. I would return
the issue as soon as you required it. If it is impossible to
send it, could the footnote be copied out (it is not very
long)? Perhaps you have in your library, or someone else
in Geneva has, a file of Golos? I am lecturing here the day
after tomorrow, Saturday. Consequently, if it cannot be
sent so as to reach me on Saturday morning, it is not worth
while sending it at all.

Regards and au revoir,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade,

It is impossible to lecture at the club about the
conference which took place, because this will mean publicity,
something the organisers of the conference fear more than
anything, and specially asked to avoid in every possible
way.[1] Consequently, the subject must be changed. I
haven’t a clear idea of who will be present at the
internationalist
club,[2] and therefore find it difficult to choose
a subject. I suggest the following: if it is essential to name
the subject beforehand, choose some vague title (“Current
Affairs” or “Urgent Problems of the Working-Class
Movement”, etc.), so that everything could be brought under
it. Meanwhile I shall take advice in Geneva, and will
prepare for the morning of the 2nd a small report or opening
to a discussion.

Au revoir,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the enlarged conference of the International Socialist
Commission held in Berne from February 5 to 9, 1916. Lenin took
an active part in the work of the conference: he wrote the “Draft
Resolution on the Convocation of the Second Socialist
Conference” =

and the delegation’s proposals on the terms of
representation at the conference (see present edition, Vol. 22, pp. 121–22).
Lenin criticised the false internationalism of the Mensheviks;
spoke on the discussion of the draft appeal of the I.S.C., “To All
Affiliated Parties and Groups”; tabled amendments to the draft
of the appeal and made a statement on behalf of the Bolsheviks
and the Territorial Executive of the Social-Democratic Party
of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania against inviting
Kautsky, Haase and Bernstein to the Second International Socialist
Conference.


Soon after the conference, Lenin circulated among the Bolshevik
groups abroad a brief about the meeting, instructing them to
start immediate preparations for the forthcoming Second
International Socialist Conference.





[2]
The internationalist club was organised at Geneva in December
1915 by Left-wing internationalist émigrés.

For Y. Larin

Dear Comrade,

To my regret, the list of contributors, the indefinite
nature of the miscellany, the restrictions imposed on the
contributors, and the lack of information about some of
them—all of this obliges me to decline to
participate.[1]

With Social-Democratic greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The letter is Lenin’s reply to Y. Larin’s proposal to take part in
a collection criticising defencism and substantiating the
Zimmerwald platform. It was to be published legally in Russia. Among the
contributors abroad were to be Axelrod, Lunacharsky and Martov.
In Russia, they were being selected by N. Sukhanov. The terms
on which these were accepted included, in particular, the
stipulation that “the articles of the collection should not contain
any attacks by contributors against each other”. The collection
was not issued.

March 19, 1916

Dear A. M.,

We have received your letter, and once again
congratulate you on your success.

I was terribly irritated by the fact that “noble” France
had (actually!) confiscated some of my registered letters
to you in America. Well, we can’t help that, can we? Now
you must do your very best about contacts with America.

You did write me that while in America you received
Internationale Flugblätter No. 1 in German, and that you
would try to publish it in
English![1] And now there’s
not a word about it?

What does it mean?!

Is that to say that no sympathisers are to be found in
America and that Internationale Flugblätter cannot be
published in English?

This is incredible!

But if that is so, it should be published in Norway (in
English). Would you undertake to translate it, and how
much will it cost to publish it?

I also wrote to you in America that I had received a
Socialist Propaganda
League[2] leaflet from Boston, Mass.
(signed by 20 Socialists with addresses, mostly in
Massachusetts). This league is internationalist, with a
programme clearly tending to the left.

I sent them the longest
letter[3] in English (and 
Internationale Flugblätter in German). There has been no reply.
I wonder if “noble” France has confiscated the lot.

If you received nothing and know nothing about them,
I shall send you their address and a copy of my letter.
Will you undertake to send it on to America?
 

And what of the Socialist Labour Party? After all, they
are internationalists (even if there is something narrowly
sectarian about them). Have they got their copy of 
Internationale Flugblätter? Have you any contacts with them?

Furthermore, you also wrote that you had started
negotiations with CharlesH. Kerr. What’s the result? He did
promise to publish a part of our pamphlet (by Lenin and
Zinoviev).

Now you say nothing more about it.... How are we to
understand
this?[4]

Internationale
Korrespondenz[5] reported that the New
Review in America had undertaken to publish articles
by the Zimmerwald Left. Is that true? Do you know the
New Review?

Reply as soon and as circumstantially as you can. You
will, of course, find out everything in great detail about
direct mail steamers from Norway to America.

As for Höglund and the Norwegians, I am still unable
to find out whether or not they have received Internationale
Flugblätter, whether or not they have published it in
Swedish and Norwegian, whether or not they have 
officially affiliated to the Zimmerwald Left (like the Rev.
Soc. Verband of Roland-Holst). Please take the trouble to
find out, get things done, give them a piece of your mind,
make them do it, follow it through! Let Bukharin inform
you of the contents of our special letter to him about the
Zimmerwald people, and please see that this is done.

Regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

My address is: Herrn Uljanow (Schuhladen Kammerer).
Spiegelgasse. 12. Zürich. I.

P.S. What interesting books and pamphlets have you
brought along? Schlüter’s history of Chartism? What else?

P.S. Am sending you our “theses” (from Vorbote No. 2).
Drive this home to the Scandinavians.

Dear A. M.,

Thank you very much for your letter. I shall send you
the address of the Socialist Propaganda League, unless
I have left it behind in Berne: in that case I shall send it
over from Berne (i.e., in 2 or 3 weeks’ time).

Do you think Appeal to Reason would refuse to reprint
Internationale Flugblätter No. 1? Is it worth trying?

Will the Socialist Labour Party agree to publish, if
we pay the costs? Are these people hopeless sectarians
or not? Have you any connections with them? Why don’t
they send us copies of their papers in the Internationale
Sozialistische Kommission? (I saw some quite by chance.)
Or are they maniacs with an idée fixe about a special “
economic” organisation of workers?

You ask how desirable it is that the Norwegian party
should send its official representative to the conference.
Of course, it is 1,000 times better to have a class-conscious
and intelligent Left-winger from among the youth, than
a Right-winger or a 1/2–Kautskyite from the party.

That is clear. Use your influence on these lines, if
you can.

I am very much distressed that we do not see eye to eye
on self-determination. Let’s try to argue this out in detail
without a squabble (which someone is trying very hard to
stir up for us on this
score)[1].... Entre nous, perhaps
Alexander will show you my reply to N. I. Bukharin’s remarks
(for the time being this discord must remain strictly
confidential, but I trust to your discretion).
 

This question (“self-determination”) is of the utmost
importance. Besides, it is organically bound up with the
question of annexations.

The best of everything,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. I sent Alexander a great big letter a few days ago.
Has he got it?

       THESES ON ITEMS 5, 6, 7a, 7b AND 8 OF THE AGENDA

In announcing the convocation of the Second
International Socialist Conference, the I.S.C. published the following
major items of the agenda:

5. “The struggle to end the war” 

6. “Problems of peace” 

7a. Parliamentary “action”

}}

“agitation and
propaganda ”

}}

}}


7b. Mass ” 

8. International Socialist Bureau.

The I.S.C. has invited organisations to discuss these
questions and send in their propositions. Here is the
response of our Party’s C.C. to the invitation:

1. In the same way as any war is only the continuation
by means of force of the policy which the belligerent powers
and the ruling classes in them carried on for long years
or decades before the war, so peace ending any war can be
nothing but an account and a record of the actual changes
in strength achieved as a result of that war.

2. Hence, any talk of assessing a given war on the strength
of the “simple” concepts of defence and attack, and of
assessing the coming peace on the strength of “simple”
high-minded wishes for a stable, democratic, honourable,
etc., peace, is most absurd and thick-witted, from the
standpoint of theory, from the standpoint of socialist
doctrine, and is the greatest deception of the working
class in practice.
 

3. The present war is an imperialist war, i.e., a war
born of contradictions on the basis of highly developed,
monopoly capitalism, which is ripe for transition to
socialism. This war is being waged for world hegemony, i.e.,
for fresh oppression of the weak nations, for another division
of the world, the division of colonies, spheres of influence,
etc.—a division in which the old robber powers, Britain,
France and Russia, would give up a share of their booty
to Germany, a younger and stronger robber power.

4. Consequently, unless a revolution of the proletariat
overthrows the present governments and present ruling
classes of the belligerent “Great” Powers, there is
absolutely no possibility of any other kind of peace, except a
more or less brief armistice between the imperialist powers,
a peace accompanied by a strengthening of reactionary
forces within the states, an intensification of the national
oppression and greater enslavement of the weak nations,
a growth in the inflammable material preparing the way
for new wars, etc., etc. For from the objective content
of the policy engendered by the whole epoch of imperialism,
the policy carried on by the bourgeoisie of all the warring
“Great” Powers both before this war and during it,
inevitably flows a peace based on a fresh and worse oppression
of nations, etc.

5. To spread among the masses of the people ideas or
hopes of the possibility of a stable or democratic, etc.,
peace between the present governments and the present
ruling classes (i.e., the bourgeoisie in alliance with the
landowners), as most of the official socialist parties are
doing, is not only shamelessly to deceive the people, but
also to blunt their vigilance and to distract them from
the revolutionary struggle, which is already in effect
beginning as a movement of strikes and demonstrations.

6. That is just the kind of deception of the people and
distraction of the proletariat from the revolutionary
struggle that is inherent in the “peace programme” now being
“unanimously” put forward both by Huysmans, the Second
International’s official representative at the congress of
the Sozialdemokratische Arbeiter Partei of Holland
in
Arnhem,[6] and by Kautsky, the most influential
theoretician of the Second International and the most influential

    

defender of the social-patriots and social-chauvinists of
all countries. Their programme is nothing but verbal and
hypocritical recognition of a few democratic pious hopes:
rejection of annexations and indemnities, self-determination
of nations, democratisation of foreign policy, courts of
arbitration to examine disputes between states,
disarmament, United States of Europe, etc., etc.

7. The most obvious confirmation of the fact that this
“peace programme” is sheer hypocrisy is, on the one hand,
its verbal acceptance by a number of bourgeois pacifists
and ministerial demagogues of the warring countries, and
on the other, its repetition by notorious (notorisch)
chauvinists at the conferences of the “socialists”, first of one
group of warring powers in London (February 1915) and
then of the other in Vienna (April
1915).[7] It is the “
socialists” who join bourgeois governments engaged in the
predatory war, who voted the war credits and assisted
the war by taking part in various organisations and
institutions, etc., who in practice pursue a policy of
defending old and new annexations, colonial oppression, etc.,
that now proclaim before the whole world their “peace
programme”, consisting of rejection of annexations and so
forth.

8. The highest authority in the Second International,
Kautsky, proclaimed to the whole world on May 21, 1915
(Neue Zeit) that the agreement and “unanimity” of “
socialists” in
London[1]

and in Vienna, on the principle of the
“independence” or self-determination of nations, proves
the Second International’s “unanimity” on, and “
viability” in, its “peace
programme”.[8] This defence and
sanction of the most crying and most brazen hypocrisy
and deception of the workers is by no means an accident,
but a systematic policy pursued in a number of countries
by men who pretend to be “internationalists”, but actually
whitewash the imperialist war by applying to it the idea
of “defence of the fatherland”, and strengthen the
domination of the labour movement by social-chauvinists, who have
betrayed socialism, by preaching “unity” with them.
This policy, which is most harmful and dangerous for the

    

working class, is being carried on by Kautsky, Haase and
others in Germany, Longuet, Pressemane and others in
France, most of the leaders in Britain, Axelrod, Martov
and Chkheidze and Co. in Russia, Trèves and others in Italy
(see the threat of Avanti!, the Central Organ of the Italian
Party, issued on March 5, 1916, to expose Trèves and other
“reformist-possibilists ” as having “set in motion every
possible means to obstruct the action of the party
leadership and Oddino Morgari towards the Zimmerwald
organisation and the new International
itself”[9]). This
world-wide policy, which is most dangerous for the
working class, may be called a Kautskian policy, after its
most authoritative representative.

9. Socialists cannot renounce the struggle for reforms.
They must vote, incidentally in parliaments as well, for
any, even minor, improvements in the condition of the
masses, such as higher aids to the inhabitants of devastated
areas, relaxation of national oppression, etc. But on the
basis of the present war and the peace which follows from
it, such reformist activity for the improvement of the
people’s condition is obviously possible only in
miniature proportions. It would be a crying deception of the
masses to suggest to them, directly or indirectly, that
a reformist solution of the problems raised by the present
war is possible. For this war has brought about a
revolutionary situation in Europe by making an issue of the
most fundamental problems of imperialism, which must
needs be solved the imperialist way unless the present
governments and ruling classes of Europe happen to be
overthrown the revolutionary way. Therefore, the main
\and basic task in the struggle for a stable and democratic
peace on the part of socialists should be: first, explanation
to the masses of the need of revolutionary mass struggle,
systematic propaganda of such struggle and the creation
of an appropriate organisation; second, exposure of the
lies and hypocrisy both of bourgeois-pacifist and socialist,
particularly Kautskian, talk about peace and the “
unanimity” of the Second International on the “peace programme”.
Such phrases are doubly hypocritical when coming
from “socialists” who echo the bourgeoisie in denying any
possibility of transforming the present imperialist war

    

into a civil war for socialism, and who oppose any
revolutionary activity in this direction.

10. The central point of the prevailing hypocrisy about
a “peace programme” is the allegedly unanimous
acceptance of struggle against old and new annexations. But
those who talk about annexations and the struggle against
them are unable, or for the most part unwilling, to think
about the meaning of annexation. It is clear that not every
attachment of “foreign” territory can be called annexation,
since socialists, generally speaking, are in favour of
eliminating frontiers between nations, the coming together
and integration of nations, and the formation of larger
states. It is clear that not every infringement of the status
quo can be considered annexation: this would be a most
reactionary attitude, and a mockery of the fundamental
conceptions of historical science. It is clear that not every
attachment by force, that is, war, can be considered
annexation, since socialists cannot object to force if it is
applied in the interests of the mass of the population and
the interests of mankind’s progress. It is clear that only
the attachment of territory against the will of its
population can and must be deemed annexation. In other words,
the concept of annexation is organically bound up with the
concept of self-determination of nations.

11. It is precisely on the basis of the present war, because
of the fact that it is imperialist on the part of both groups
of warring “Great” Powers, that there was bound to
develop, and actually did develop, the phenomenon of the
bourgeoisie and social-chauvinists intensively “fighting”
against “annexations”, if they have been carried out, or
are being carried out, by an enemy state. Südekum and his
Austro-German friends and defenders, including Haase
and Kautsky, are silent about the annexations carried out
by Germany in respect of Alsace-Lorraine, Denmark, Poland,
etc., but very often “fight against annexations” carried
out by Russia in respect of Finland, Poland, Ukraine, the
Caucasus, etc., by Britain in respect of India, and so forth.
On the other side, the British, French, Italian and Russian
Südekums, i.e., Hyndman, Guesde, Vandervelde, Renaudel,
Trèves, Plekhanov, Axelrod, Chkheidze and Co., are silent
about Britain’s annexations in respect of India, France’s

    

in respect of Nice or Morocco, Italy’s in respect of Tripoli
or Albania, Russia’s in respect of Poland, Ukraine, etc.,
but then largely “fight against annexations” carried out
by Germany.

It is clear that such “struggle against annexations” on
the part of the social-chauvinists and Kautskyites is
hypocritical through and through, and the bourgeoisie is
assisting such struggle directly, by allocating millions
upon millions for chauvinist propaganda, and indirectly,
by granting a monopoly of legality only to the
social-chauvinists and the Kautskyites.

It is clear that both the French “socialists” who justify
a war for Alsace-Lorraine, and the German “socialists” who
refuse to demand freedom for Alsace-Lorraine to secede from
Germany, are equally annexationists, for all their swearing
to the contrary. It is clear that Russian “socialists” who
speak or write against the “break-up of Russia”, or, behind
the “peace without annexations ” slogan, justify, directly or
indirectly, the present war over who is to enslave Poland,
are just as much annexationists, and so on and so forth.

12. If socialists are not to transform “the struggle against
annexations” into an empty phrase or into revolting
hypocrisy, they should, first, explain to the masses the need
for revolutionary struggle for the conquest of political
power by the proletariat and a socialist revolution which
springs from all the conditions of the imperialist epoch
and the present imperialist war, and which alone can firmly
and everywhere ensure the self-determination of nations,
i.e., liberate oppressed nations and effect the coming
together and integration of nations, not on the basis of force
but on the basis of the equal rights and consent of the
proletariat and working people of all nations; secondly,
immediately mount the widest propaganda and agitation
against the veiled chauvinism and annexationism of the
official socialist parties, especially in the “Great” Powers.
Socialists should explain to the masses that the English
socialist who does not struggle now for freedom of secession
for Ireland, India, etc., is a socialist and internationalist
only in words, and a chauvinist and annexationist in
practice. The same applies to the French socialist who does
not fight for the freedom of the French colonies, against

    

the war to annex Alsace-Lorraine, etc.; the German
socialist who does not fight for freedom of secession for
Alsace-Lorraine, the Danes, the Poles, the Belgians, the Serbs
and others; the Russian socialist who does not fight for
freedom of secession for the Ukraine, Finland, etc., and
against war over Poland; the Italian socialist who does
not fight for freedom of secession for Tripoli, Albania, etc.;
the Dutch socialist who does not fight for freedom of
secession and independence for the Dutch East Indies; the Polish
socialist who does not fight for full freedom and equality
for the Jews and the Ukrainians oppressed by the Poles,
and so on.

13. It inevitably follows from the Zimmerwald
manifesto and the I.S.C. circular of Feb. 10, 1916 (Bulletin
No. 3)[10] that all “war on war” and “struggle for peace”
are hypocrisy unless they are indissolubly bound up with
immediate revolutionary mass struggle, and with its
propaganda and preparation. But this conclusion must be
set forth straightforwardly and definitely. There is need,
first, to explain to the masses what the development of
the revolutionary mass struggle in the conditions of a
European war can and must (muss) lead to. It leads
inevitably to the transformation of the imperialist war into
a civil war for socialism. This is hinted at by all the speeches
about it being better for the workers to die for their own
cause, rather than for someone else’s. But a hint is
insufficient. The masses should have clearly put before them the
great, even though maybe not very immediate, aim. They
should know what direction to take and why. Second,
if we call on the masses to fight their governments “
regardless of the military position of a given country”, we
thereby not only reject in principle the admissibility of
“defence of the fatherland ” in the present war, but recognise
the desirability of defeat of any bourgeois government, in
order to transform the defeat into a revolution. And this
must be said straightforwardly: revolutionary mass struggle
cannot become international unless its class-conscious
representatives openly unite for the purpose of defeating and
overthrowing all bourgeois governments. Third—and this
is most important—it is impossible to carry on a
revolutionary mass struggle without creating everywhere, not

    

only at the top but also in the midst of the masses, an
illegal organisation for its propaganda, preparation and
discussion of its course and conditions. If there have been
street demonstrations in Germany, if there have been many
letters from the front calling on the people not to subscribe
to the war loan in France, if there have been mass strikes
in Britain, to say nothing of Russia, then in order to aid
this struggle, to unify it on an international scale, it is
unquestionably necessary to report every step along this
road in a free, i.e., illegal, press, analysing the successes,
assessing their conditions, and building up and developing
the struggle. Without an illegal organisation and an illegal
press the acceptance of “mass action” will remain an
empty phrase (as is the case in
Switzerland).[2]


14. On the question of the socialists’ parliamentary
struggle (Aktion), it should be borne in mind that the
Zimmerwald resolution not only expresses its sympathy
with the five Social-Democratic deputies of the Duma,
who belong to our Party, and who have been sentenced to
exile in Siberia, but also proclaims its solidarity with their
tactics. It is impossible to recognise the revolutionary
struggle of the masses and put up with the purely legal,
purely reformist activity of socialists in parliaments;
this leads only to legitimate dissatisfaction among the
workers, and their leaving the S.D. ranks for anti-parliamentary
anarchism or syndicalism. It is essential to say clearly
and publicly that Social-Democrats in parliaments must
use their position not only to make parliamentary speeches,
but also to give all-round extra-parliamentary assistance
to the illegal organisation and revolutionary struggle
of the workers, and that the masses themselves must, through
their illegal organisation, check up on such activity by
their leaders.

15. The question of convening the International
Socialist Bureau, included in the agenda of the coming Second
International Socialist Conference, unavoidably raises the
more fundamental question of principle, namely, whether
the unity of the old parties and of the Second International
is possible. The wider the sympathy among the masses

    

for the Zimmerwald organisation, the less understandable
for the masses and the more harmful for the development
of their struggle is the inconsistency and timidity of the
attitude which in essence identifies the old parties and
the Second International with bourgeois policy in the
working-class movement (see the Zimmerwald manifesto and
I.S.C. circular of Feb. 10, 1916), while fearing a split with
them, and promising to dissolve the I.S.C. directly the old
International Socialist Bureau reassembles.

This promise was not voted upon, and was not even
discussed at Zimmerwald.

During the six months since Zimmerwald, it has become
even clearer that a split is inevitable, that the work
recommended by the Zimmerwald manifesto cannot be carried
on in unity with the old parties, and that the fear of a
split hampers every step on that way. In Germany it is not
only the Internationale Sozialisten Deutschlands group
that has condemned the fear of a split, and has openly
come out against the hypocrisy of those who preach unity;
Otto Rühle, a member of the Reichstagsfraktion and a
close associate of Karl Liebknecht, has openly declared for
a split. And Vorwärts has failed to find a single serious
or honest argument against Rühle. In France, Bourderon,
a member of the Socialist Party, is against a split in words,
but has actually tabled in the Congress a resolution which
directly “désapprouve [disapproves ] of the C.A.P. [Comité
Administratif Permanent=Party Executive] and the G.P.”
(Groupe Parlementaire=parliamentary group). The
adoption of such a resolution would clearly mean an immediate
and unquestionable split in the party. In Britain, T. 
Russel Williams, even writing in the moderate Labour Leader,
has openly and repeatedly declared the inevitability of a
split, and has met with support from some members of
his party. In America, with formal unity in the Socialist
Party, some of its members declare for militarism and
war (so-called preparedness), and others, among them
Eugene Debs, the one-time Socialist candidate for the
Presidency, openly preach civil war for socialism in connection
with the looming war.

There is already an actual split throughout the world,
and closing their eyes to this only tends to harm the

    

Zimmerwaldists, making them ridiculous in the eyes of the
masses, who know perfectly well that each step in their
work in the spirit of Zimmerwald means a continuation
and widening of the split.

It takes courage openly to recognise what is inevitable
and what has taken place, to abandon the harmful illusions
about unity being possible with the “defenders of the
fatherland ” in the present war, to help the masses to be rid of
the influence of those leaders who are “misleading them”
(see the I.S.C. circular of Feb. 10, 1916) or paving the way
for a plot (Pakt) against socialism via an “amnesty”.

That is our proposal on the item of the agenda for the
calling of the International Socialist Bureau at The Hague.
 *     *  * 

Reformist talk is the main means for deceiving the
people at a time when the objective situation has placed
on the agenda of history the greatest world crisis, which,
regardless of the will of the several parties, can be either
evaded or put off until the next imperialist war, or resolved
through a socialist revolution. It is neither an accident
nor the ill will of the several governments or capitalists
of some country but the whole evolution of bourgeois
relations that has led to imperialism and the present
imperialist war. Nor is it an accident or the result of some
demagogy or agitation but the objective conditions of the
wartime crisis and the aggravation of class contradictions
that are now giving rise to the strikes, demonstrations and
similar other manifestations of mass revolutionary struggle
in a number of belligerent countries.

Objectively the question appears in this way—and in
no other: either to help this still weak but internally
powerful and deep ferment and movement of the masses, which
is potentially capable of developing into a socialist
revolution; or to conduct a policy of assisting the bourgeois
governments (Durchhaltspolitik, politique
jusquauboutiste[3]

).

The
real meaning of the sugary talk about a democratic peace
is nothing but assistance to the governments through the
hypocritical dulling and duping of the masses.
    

     *     *  * 

This war has raised the fundamental questions of
imperialism, that is, the questions of the very existence of
capitalist society, and it would be quackery to suggest to
the people—directly or indirectly—that any reformist
solution of these problems is possible. What is involved
here is a fresh division of the world in accordance with
the new balance of forces between the capitalist states,
which over the last few decades have been developing not
only at exceptional speed but—and this is especially
important—extremely unevenly. On the basis of capitalist
social relations this redivision of the world is
inconceivable except through force and war. The objective state of
things rules out any reformist solution for the mature
contradictions; it rules out any other way out except a
series of imperialist wars or a socialist revolution of the
proletariat, for whose success the imperialist epoch itself
has already created the conditions. Real political activity
in these conditions is possible only as one of two things:
assistance to “one’s own” national bourgeoisie in
plundering other countries, or assistance to the
incipient....[4]

The proposals by the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. to
the Second Zimmerwald Conference were written in response
to the I.S.C.’s “Appeal to All Affiliated Parties and Groups”
(see Internationale Sozialistische Kommission zu Bern. Bulletin
No. 3, February 29, 1916).

There are two variants of the proposals in manuscript of which
the initial 15–point text is published in this volume. For the
second (final) eight-point variant see present edition, Vol. 22,
pp. 109–79.


The Second International Socialist Conference was held in
Kienthal (Switzerland) from April 24 to 30, 1916. It was attended by
the representatives of Germany (7), Italy (7), Russia (8,
including Lenin and Petrova [Inessa Armand]), Poland (5), France
(4), Switzerland (5), etc., a total of 43 persons, of whom 12 were
firm supporters of the Left.

On the agenda there were the following items: the struggle to
end the war, the proletariat’s attitude to the questions of peace,
parliamentary activity and mass struggle; the convocation of
the International Socialist Bureau, etc. At this Conference, the
Left was stronger than at Zimmerwald. Lenin secured the
adoption of a resolution criticising social-pacifism and the activity
of the International Socialist Bureau. The Conference helped to
bring out and rally the internationalist elements who, in 1919,
on the initiative of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, set up the Third,
Communist, International. But the Conference failed to adopt
the basic planks of Bolshevik policy, namely, transformation
of the imperialist war into a civil war, defeat of one’s own
imperialist government in the war, and organisation of the Third
International.





[6]
The congress of the Social-Democratic Party of Holland was held
at Arnhem on January 8 and 9, 1916.





[7]
London Conference of Socialists of the Entente Countries was held
on February 14, 1915. It was attended by social-chauvinists and
pacifists from the socialist parties of Britain, France, and Belgium,
and by the Mensheviks and S.R.s from Russia.

Although the Bolsheviks had not been invited, Litvinov (
Maximovich) went to the conference on Lenin’s instructions to read
out a declaration of the R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, based
on a draft written by Lenin. It demanded the withdrawal of
socialists from bourgeois governments, a complete break with the
imperialists, refusal to co-operate with them, resolute struggle
against one’s own imperialist government and condemnation of
the voting of war credits. Litvinov was reading the declaration,
when he was interrupted and ruled out of order. He handed the
text of the declaration to the presidium and left the conference.
For details on the London conference, see present edition,
Vol. 21, pp. 132–34 and 178–80.

The Vienna Conference of Socialists of Germany and Austria,
a kind of response to the London Conference of Socialists of the
Entente Countries, was held in April 1915. It endorsed the
social-chauvinist “Defend the Fatherland ” slogan.

Association, adopted unanimously at the February meeting of the

Committee, led by Lenin, tabled a statement saying that it
regarded the appeal as a step forward in comparison with the
decisions of the First International Socialist Conference in
Zimmerwald, but did not find it satisfactory in every respect. The appeal
appeared in Bulletin der I.S.K. No. 3 on February 29, 1916
and in Sotsial-Demokrat No. 52 on March 25, 1916.

Dear A. M.,

I have only just learned from Alexander’s letter to
Grigory of the sad fate of our friends in the town from which
Alexander has
come.[1]

I hope you will make use of all your connections, and
do everything possible and impossible to extricate them
and help them in every way.

I have decided not to write to Branting, because my
recommendation at present in all respects—you will
appreciate—may do harm. Probably it will be best of all
for you to get things moving through your Norwegian
friends. Cable, if you need anything else.

(In case of necessity, perhaps the appeal could go through
Denmark? It would also be valid through the German
Social-Democratic deputies but for the fact that the Right-wingers
are very angry with you. Now if you could try through the
non-Rightist German Social-Democrats....)

I am surprised that Alexander has received only one
letter from me. I sent three: the second to the town from
which Alexander has come (addressed to the “Secretary
of the Party” at the People’s House—telephone there, if
possible); the third went to his present address. I hope
he’s got the third letter by now. I am expecting him to
write, for he has been somewhat niggardly about writing.
Best regards to him from me and N. K. To you too.

Yours,
 Lenin

Dear A. M.,

You know, of course, that Huysmans is calling the
neutrals together for
June 26.[1] We must try to have one of
“our men” attend from the Scandinavian countries, and we
ought to think out his line thoroughly. Please, write as
soon as you can whether there is any hope of this (so that
we should have time to exchange letters).

Do you read the German Social-Democratic papers? The
Braunschweig Volksfreund gave a good answer to
Huysmans,[2] while the Chemnitz Volksstimme, which is an organ
of the Right, said it was in complete agreement with
Huysmans’s criticism of the
Zimmerwaldists.[3]

Is there any hope of the sentence on Höglund being
quashed? This is unheard-of, incredible
ferocity![4]

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Best regards to Nik. Ivanovich, from whom there was a
telegram but no letter. I wish him with all my heart an
early rest and quick recovery. How are his finances?

P.S. Isn’t 75 kronen too much for the pamphlet in
English?[5] Perhaps we should wait?
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Conference of Socialists of Neutral Countries set by C. 
Huysmans for June 26, 1916 was held in The Hague on July 31. It was
attended by eight delegates from Holland, by K. Branting from
Sweden, by Th. Stauning from Denmark, and one delegate each
from Argentina and the United States. This Conference of
socialist Right-wingers adopted a resolution favouring freedom of trade
as a condition of “stable peace and international solidarity”.





[2]
A reference to C. Huysmans’s report at the extraordinary
congress of the Social-Democratic Party of Holland in Arnhem on
January 9, 1916, on the activity of the International. He put
forward a programme of “democratic peace” and made the
following proposals: =

1) limitation of armaments; =

2) national self–
determination; =

3) democratisation of diplomacy; and =

4) establishment
of a court of arbitration. =

He dealt with the Zimmerwald
Conference and its Left wing. The newspaper Volksfreund, in an article
entitled “De Brouckère über die Internationale” (De Brouckère
about the International) in its No. 38 of February 15, 1916,
carried the full text of a letter from the editor of the banned Belgian
Social-Democratic newspaper, Le Peuple, L. de Brouckère, to
P. Renaudel (the editor of l’Humanité during the First World
War). In the concluding part of its article, Volksfreund
wrote: “Just as it is impossible to restore, together with
Huysmans, the old image of the Second International with the aid
of phrases, so the new International, together with de Brouckère,
cannot be a shadow repeating the actions of the imperialism of
the Entente. The new International will either become a militant,
cohesive organisation against the imperialism of the East, the
West and of Central Europe, or it will be a mere phrase or a tool
of imperialism.”

Dear Alexander,

The conference is over, its manifesto has been published
(May 1).[2] I hope you receive Berner Tagwacht—or some
other Swiss paper? If not, drop us a line, and we shall send
you the French text.

Grigory is preparing a circumstantial letter about the
conference, and this will be sent to you.

After all, a manifesto was adopted: that is a step
forward, because it was accepted by the French deputies (three,
one of them the semi-chauvinist
Brizon).[3] A resolution
criticising pacifism, and a resolution on the International
Socialist Bureau, sharply criticising it, were adopted. On
the whole, this is none the less, despite the mass of defects,
a step towards a break with the social-patriots.

This time the Left was stronger: a Serb, three Swiss and
a Frenchman (not a deputy; not from any group, but on
his own) reinforced our Left. Then there were two Germans
(from the Internationale
group)[4] who supported us on
the main questions.

Have you seen the Huysmans manifesto? It contains
an unmistakable malicious “hint” about us! The
Braunschweig Volksfreund gave him a good answer.

As regards the
Japanese,[5] we have decided to make
another, and, I hope, final, attempt to reach agreement:
(1) all the old agreements (verbal) are
cancelled;
(2) an
agreement between the Central Organ’s editorial board,
which edits the issue, and the publishers to be concluded
from issue to issue, i.e., for each issue separately;
(3) No. 3
to be published at Berne (clearly it is impossible at
Stockholm).
 

Try and see whether it will come off or not. If not, we
shall publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata. We can’t
wait.[6]

Here is the plan for No. 3:

1) Material from Russia (up to 3 sheets).

2) Theses of the Central Organ’s editorial board on
self-determination.

3) Lenin’s article on the same subject.

4) The 2nd Zimmerwald Conference. Grigory Zinoviev
or Lenin.

5) Bukharin: an economic subject.

6) Lyalin on the high cost of living.

7) Alexander—from Russia.

8) A Serb and an Italian have promised articles.

9) Russian themes—Grigory Zinoviev.

10) Radek—continuation (? hardly worth while. In
my opinion,
no).[1]


10) Kollontai—from America.

11) A Lett.

12) Varin.

13) The women’s labour movement.

14) Book reviews.

15) About Trotsky, Martov and the Chkheidze group....

Think it over, probe the ground, get the facts, as
tactfully as possible, and reply as soon as you
can.[7]

All the best, and wishes for every success.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. As Nadya has already written, I agree with you on
the Jewish
miscellany.[8] Nadya has repeatedly written
to Berne for the material. Regards to Alexandra
Mikhailovna!

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 

[1]
This point is crossed out in the MS. Lenin, had in view a
continuation of the Radek article, “A Quarter of a Century of Development
of Imperialism”, carried in No. 1–2 of Kommunist.—Ed.
 



[2]
The Second International Conference held in Kienthal (
Switzerland) from April 24 to 30, 1916.





[3]
Among the French delegation at the Kienthal Conference were
Jean Longuet’s supporters: P. Brizon, A. Blanc and J. 
Raffin-Dugens, who after the war joined the French Communist Party;
Brizon soon left the party.





[4]
The Left wing at the Kienthal Conference was stronger than at
Zimmerwald. At the First International Socialist Conference,
the Zimmerwald Left consisted of eight persons, and of twelve
at Kienthal, and on some issues obtained nearly one half the votes.
This was a reflection of the change in the balance of forces in the
international working-class movement in favour of the
internationalists.

Lenin, referring to the strengthening of the Left at the
Conference, has the following delegates in mind: Katslerovich (Serbia),
Flatten, Nobs, Agnes Robmann (Switzerland) and Guilbeaux
(France), who joined the Zimmerwald Left. The German 
Internationale group was represented by Berta Thalheimer and E. 
Meyer.





[5]
The name given to G. Pyatakov and Yevgenia Bosch because
they had emigrated from Russia to Switzerland via Japan.





[6]
There was no agreement on Lenin’s terms. Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata was issued in place of Kommunist.





[7]
Lenin’s plan was not accepted by the Bukharin-Pyatakov group,
who insisted on their own plan, under which, apart from Lenin’s
articles on the right of nations to self-determination, the
publication was to contain articles by Radek, Pyatakov and Bukharin
on the national question.





[8]
The miscellany referred to here was to have been published abroad
on the basis of material brought by Shlyapnikov from Russia
and describing the condition of the Jews during the war.
However, it did not appear.

Dear V. K.,

As we agreed, I intend to visit Geneva and Lausanne
for a lecture, “Two Streams in the International Labour
Movement” (you said that this title was better than “Two
Internationals”, which I used here).

If conditions have not changed, and my trip will pay for
itself, please fix the date for a fortnight ahead (at Lausanne
the day
after).[1]

I shall be awaiting your reply.

I need to work a day or so at the Geneva Public Library.
Could you find out whether by any chance it will be closed
on any day, apart from the holidays?

Salutations,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s lecture at Geneva, “Two Streams in the International
Labour Movement”, was given on Friday, June 2, 1916, according
to the posters issued by the Geneva Bolshevik group, now in the
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee. The lecture at Lausanne was given on June 3.

For Alexander

May 23, 1916

Dear Friend,

I have only just received from Grigory your letter to
him of May 19.

You write that “the correspondence and negotiations
with Kommunist have become a terrible bore”. I quite
understand you, but do have patience! You can’t, after
all, once you have set about negotiating, have attacks of
nerves and fall into despair. That’s not the proletarian
way, really and truly.

You put two questions:
(1) to co-opt two more (C.O.
supporters) to the editorial board;
(2) to start a Discussion
Section in Kommunist.

On the first point you write: “From conversations with
them I realise that they have nothing against it, though
of course it grieves them.”

I began thinking about your plan. I think that to take
on non-writers (particularly after all our sad experiments)
would be an absolute iniquity, something we could not
justify before the Party. We could, perhaps, find one writer
(I have one in my mind; I must find out more about him,
and think it over again and again, before saying yes or
no). It’s much harder getting another one.

Could you modify your plan, to make it workable, in
this way: either the C.O. editorial board co-opts two Party
writers, if they are available (then there will be seven);
or, if it manages to find only one, the publishers (the
Kievskys, he and she) delegate one of their number to the

    

editorial board (then there will be five: Bukharin+a
publisher+three here)?

(I personally would find the latter particularly suitable,
because
(a) it would obviate the need to invent editors;
(b) it would not reduce the “rights” of the publishers,
because it is all the same to have one to one or two to two;
(c) it would create an editorial board of writers, which is
extremely important in a Party sense, to combat the
striving abroad for editorial positions.)

Think it over and reply (if not inconvenient, probe
the ground among the publishers).

As regards the Discussion Section, your plan is debatable,
if it is implemented in a practical way and if one little
thing, which you could not have known of, is eliminated.

In a practical way means laying down precisely who has
the right to have a discussion article inserted. All members
of the editorial board. That is unquestionable. Is it
sufficient? I think it is. The editorial board will consist of five
or seven persons.

The “one little thing” is this. A discussion within the
Party. Undoubtedly. Well, but what about inflaming
differences or opening doors for groups abroad which are
not in the Party? This is the point. The publishers made
Kommunist impossible, because they did not want any
discussion, they did not write or prepare anything at all
for discussion—but played on Radek’s striving to crawl
through the cracks of our Party from outside. Radek and
the Nashe Slovo people, and many others among the groups
abroad, are simply straining, in the guise of discussion,
to bring about divisions amongst us, to blow up
discontents, and hamper our work (an old game of exiles
abroad!).

You may not know that Radek pushed us out of the
Vorbote editorial board. It was initially agreed that there
would be a joint editorial board composed of two groups:
(1) the Dutch (maybe+Trotsky) and (2) us (i.e., Radek,
Grigory and me). This condition gave us equal rights on
the editorial board.

Radek intrigued for months, and got the “missus”
(Roland-Hoist) to cancel this plan. We were demoted to
the position of contributors. It’s a fact!
 

Is it proper to reward Radek for this feat by giving him
the right to “discuss”, and the publishers, the right to
hide behind Radek? That will be not discussion, but
dissension and intrigue.
(1) Gazeta Robotnicza (February
1916), in which Radek participates, carried some purely
factional attacks on us, and a resolution on Nashe Slovo
lines.
(2) Now on the question of assessing the Irish
insurrection (a most important question, is it not? Not.
abstract “theory”!) both
Radek[1] and Kulisher (the Cadet
in
Rech[2] are in full agreement, stupidly calling it a
“putsch”.

This is incredible, but it’s a fact!

If, in the guise of “discussion”, the publishers want
to provide a platform for all the groups abroad wishing to
fight our Party without joining it, that is not discussion,
it is a game.

X

If they don’t want this, why not lay down precisely,
for example, that the right to open discussions is restricted
(1) to members of the editorial board;
(2) to the Party
organisations in Russia;
(3) to the
C.O.A.,[3] being the

X

organisation of the Party outside Russia?

Kommunist was an alliance with the Dutch and Radek.
This alliance has been changed by the fact that we were
downgraded in the Dutch-Radek journal from editors to
contributors. So don’t cherish any harmful illusions about
the alliance remaining the same! These are harmful
illusions! We have to go forward ourselves, not allowing our
hands to be tied. Not in any way.

The practical conclusion: think over (and I will think
it over and write to Grigory about it) the
following §§:

1) the composition of the editorial board is changed:
5 or 7 (see above);

2) another title is chosen (Sbornik or the like);

X\

3) explicit rules of discussion (e.g., in the spirit of

| ];

X’



4) Switzerland to be the place of publication (for some
reason you don’t mention this point. Why?);

5) the income is divided in such-and-such a way. Will
the publishers agree to provide 1/2 for the cost of transport

    

and of maintenance for the organiser of contacts, etc., i.e.,
yourself?


Reply!

Yours,
 V. Ulyanov

Thousands of best wishes, and don’t let your nerves go.
Chiefs have no right to have fits of nerves!

Dear A. M.,

I was very glad to have your news and
information.[1]
We shall have to be patient about America: it’s worth
while publishing only over there.

I hope you will do everything possible to consolidate
matters as regards the Left Swedes and Norwegians. So far
nothing has yet been fixed. Not a thing! There is only
talk. There is neither formal affiliation with the Left,
nor proper relations with us, not a single thing. And this
after the Höglund affair! I can’t understand these people!

As regards the meeting of the neutrals at The Hague
on June 26, I have this plan: it is clear that the phlegmatic
Norwegians will be unable to do a thing without a
knowledge of foreign languages. Why don’t you go as
well?[2]

Why could not the C.C. of the Norwegian Party appoint
X plus you? X is essential, as a local man, while you are
a plus. Even if as an interpreter. You would be
exceptionally useful, because then you would get to know
everything. I am certain that, otherwise, we won’t even get
a full, precise, clear and accurate report of what has taken
place (and the workers of the whole world will not get
one either). Think about this. And do everything possible
for it.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. I haven’t read the Rybalka
pamphlet[3]: too busy.
Tell me: did the stupid S.R. pamphlets weaken the
significance of the revolutionary struggle of the S.R. peasants?

    

Did the provocateur Gapon weaken the significance of
the revolutionary struggle of the Gapon workers? They
call the Irish insurrection a “putsch” (have you seen
K. Radek in Berner Tagwacht?)—and you put up with this!?
I don’t understand you. I absolutely do not understand.
If anything, this in particular has proved the indecent
pedantry and stupid doctrinaire approach of K. Radek
in Berner Tagwacht and those “of like mind with him”.

If your journey is impossible, could you, at any rate,
get the C.C. of the Norwegian Party to pass a decision to
the effect that the delegate should carefully and on the
spot make a note of everything that takes place?
 

Notes

A reference to Alexandra Kollontai’s letter to Lenin on May 28,
1916, reporting the withdrawal from the Central Committee of
the Swedish Social-Democratic Party of its secretary F. Ström
and three of its members, which deepened the “actual although
not yet formal split of the party”. She went on to say: “The Swedes
are working well to build up the Left wing. They are drawing
up a clever plan of battle, which they intend to fight against
the Right wing at the party congress to be held in winter, as a
result of which the party’s formal break-up will follow logically.
They should be supported in their desire to stand apart.” =

Concerning the talks on the publication in America of Zimmerwald
Left literature, Kollontai wrote: “There is no reply from America
yet, but a few days ago the mail arrived and I received a reply
on the letters sent simultaneously with letters to the Socialist
Labour Party and to Charles Kerr.”





[2]
The Conference of Socialists of Neutral Countries set for June 26,
1916 was held at The Hague on July 31, 1916. Lenin is referring
to the participation in it of a Left-winger from the Norwegian
Social-Democratic Party.





[3]
A reference to L. Rybalka’s pamphlet, L’Ukraine et la Guerre
(The Ukraine and the War), Lausanne, 1916. In a letter to Lenin
on May 28, 1916, Alexandra Kollontai called it a “disgracefully
chauvinist” piece of writing.

For Comrade Alexander

Dear Alexander,

Of course we shall give Belenin 300 kronen, if he has
already so firmly decided on his plan for a trip. It will be
a pity if he goes. In any case, you must do everything to
ensure his return in a few months.

As regards the “Japanese”, you shouldn’t think that they
have made “considerable concessions” in the draft you have
sent on. They haven’t made any at all! On the contrary,
the demand that the two should have the right to haul in
dissenting contributors is an innovation, an addition, a
surenchère. And this innovation clearly exposes their
“policy” in the worst sense of the word. If the founders, the
publishers, the young contributors want freedom of opinion
for themselves—freedom of discussion—that is legitimate.
But if people, behind this legitimate desire, try to smuggle
in “discussion” which is not their own, but that of “
contributors”, isn’t it clear that this is a game?

Never has there been anything like this anywhere. If
the two want publicity for all kinds of intrigues abroad—let
them go ahead, and let them be responsible for it. I cannot
participate in this either directly or indirectly.

You will ask, perhaps, where is the proof that it is a
question of intrigues abroad? I wrote to you about this
long ago, and you have not replied a single time. The proof
is the issue of Gazeta Robotnicza (February 1976), from
which we have Radek and Bronski as “contributors”.

That is a fact.
 

These gentlemen were the first in the Zimmerwald Left
to start an intrigue—and at what a time! They want to
“play off” Chkheidze and Trotsky.

At such a moment the two publishers do not blush to
propose to us that we should give them “freedom and a
guarantee” of discussion for such contributors! This is
either madness, or the height of impudence.

And equal representation with them (6=3+3), is that not
the same thing? Why, they once gave you to understand
(and you wrote this yourself) that they would accept the
co-opting of two, supporters of the C.O. But when it came
to having a written agreement, they beat a retreat. Isn’t
that the game of petty hucksters?

If people are in agreement, sincerely and in principle,
to have a journal or a miscellany support the Programme
of the Party, then the majority must be for it. Otherwise
there is no sincerity, no principle, only “the purse strings”.

My view is, explain all this to them clearly, in popular
language, if necessary in writing, and give them an
ultimatum: either this way (7=4+3), or you send in your
conclusion about their “game” to the
Bureau.[1] That will be the
correct Party reply.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

On A. Shlyapnikov’s proposal, the C.C. Bureau in Russia
examined the friction within the editorial board of Kommunist and
adopted the following resolution: “Having heard the statement
of Comrade Belenin (A. Shlyapnikov) concerning the differences

points of the Party programme and tactics, the C.C. Bureau deems
it necessary to inform the C.O. editorial board abroad of the

   

following: =

1) The C.C. Bureau in Russia, declaring its complete
solidarity with the main line of the C.C., being conducted in the
C.O., Sotsial-Demokrat, expresses the wish that all C.C.
publications should be edited in a strictly consistent spirit, in
complete accord with the C.C. line adopted by it at the outbreak of
war; =

2) The Bureau goes on record as opposing the transformation
of C.C. publications into discussion publications; =

3) The Bureau
believes that the differences between contributors on some
questions of the minimum programme and the C.O. editorial board
cannot be an obstacle to their participation in C.C. publications,
and invites the C.O. Editorial Board to accept their collaboration
on other questions which are not at issue; =

4) The Bureau suggests
that private publishers should be used in Russia and abroad to
clear up and eliminate differences through the issue of special
discussion collections.”

Dear Alexander,

I wrote to you briefly yesterday. Today I want to have a
further talk.

I am revolted by the “conditions” laid down by the
Japanese. That two editors should have the right to decide on
inserting an article written for discussion purposes by a
contributor! Not even three, but only two: in other words,
the publishers “depend” on no one but
themselves.[1]

The meaning of this clause is clear: they want to hide
behind Radek and inflame our differences with him and
with the
P.S.D.[2] This is not discussion, but the height of
intrigue, the utmost cravenness. It’s just as it was in Paris in
1911, when we were “dragged” into a discussion with
Rappoport, or Lyova, or Viktoryonok, or Bogdanov! I have
written to, you that the Polish Gazeta Robotnicza (February
1916) is attacking us just like those Parisians did then.

In no circumstances will I join an editorial board which is
intriguing in this way, under the guise of discussion. If you,
Japanese, want to help to disorganise our Party, do it on
your own responsibility. Your purse is full. Go ahead and
publish the “discussion” by Radek or Gazeta Robotnicza:
then the Russian workers will see at once that you are
intriguers, and will kick you out. But you want to play this
mean trick under cover of a “collective board”. Sorry, but I
won’t accept this and will expose you. That is my reply
to the Japanese on this question.

The same goes for “equal rights” (the elimination of the
seventh member, or voting on
him).[3] This is a
continuation of the old “game”. What has Party membership got
to do with it? The point is that we are to give “equal rights”

    

to people who have shown themselves in the negative! Why
should we? Equal rights = the right to spoil the work! In
the name of what? For what purpose? To make dissension
permanent?

No. If they want to make a new experiment, we shall take
a new journal, or more precisely miscellany,
and try (the
old confidence has been undermined) to issue one with an
editorial board of seven. We shall make the experiment:
this is the maximum concession which I can conscientiously
allow. If the experiment fails, the intriguers and the
capitalists lose nothing, because the “purse” can always be
withdrawn. And we shall then issue our own miscellany. One
that is simple, clear and without intrigue.

I wish you all the best, and ask you to be patient.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the draft agreement on the further publication of
Kommunist, drawn up by G. Pyatakov and Yevgenia Bosch, and
transmitted by A. Shlyapnikov to Lenin. In the text of the draft
Lenin struck out the following points:

“The founders of the publishing house and its responsible
representatives are Comrades P. and N. Kievsky”;

“The consent of at least two editors is required for the insertion
of articles by contributors in the Kommunist’s Discussion
Section....”;

“The sixth person is to be co-opted to the publishing house
on the recommendation of Comrades Lenin and Zinoviev.
Comrades Lenin and Zinoviev have the right to recommend a seventh
person to the publishing house from among Party writers but his
admission is to be subject to a vote and is to be decided by a
simple majority of the editors....”

The Point 6 mentioned by Lenin is given in the draft agreement
as follows:

“6. The Right of the C.C. 

“The Party C.C. or its Bureau have the right to insert their
official documents, statements, etc., in the magazine Kommunist,
without however taking up more than 15 per cent of the total
space.”





[2]
Differences between Lenin, and Radek and the Social-Democratic
Party of Poland and Lithuania on the national question. The
essence of these differences is set out by Lenin in his article “The
Discussion on Self-Determination Summed Up” (see present
edition, Vol. 22, pp. 320–60).

June 17, 1916

Dear Friend,

Nadezhda Konstantinovna is writing to you about other
matters, but I will reply to your P.S. to me.

You write that “our people have no evil intentions”, and
you add that for the Kievskys “it’s a matter of the national
question alone, and that they write the articles
themselves”.

If that were the case, why then have a paragraph in the
Rules about the right of discussion for contributors on the
demand of two (note: not even three, but two, i.e., distrust
of Bukharin on the part of the Japanese)? In that event,
this paragraph would have no meaning. And it is a thing
without precedent for two editors out of six or seven to
demand “freedom” of discussion (alleged discussion) not for
themselves, but for contributors.

No. The Japanese woman cannot insert meaningless
paragraphs into the Rules. The meaning of this paragraph is
just this, and only this, that our hands are being tied, and
we find ourselves helpless against the striving of the Poles
to start an intrigue.

You write that you have not seen Gazeta Robotnicza (you
should have been sent it, and also the C.O.A. resolution
adopted with the participation of Grigory: I am writing to him
and Zina at once, to have them send it to you immediately).
You say, moreover, that for this reason “you don’t know
what it’s all about”.

But you add there and then, for some reason: “I know,
I feel, that you have cooled off towards Radek and Co.”

You will agree that this is somewhat strange. After all,

    

my apprehension about intrigue on the part of Radek and
Co., my conviction that this is so, springs directly from the
facts concerning Vorbote (I wrote to you about
it).[1]
That is the first point. And the second, and most important,
is that it springs from Gazeta Robotnicza.

It is in that paper that Radek and Co. began an intrigue
against us, when we had nowhere written a single line
against
them![2] After all, this is a fact. You can’t brush
facts aside. The old “game” (the word used in the C.O.A.
resolution) of playing up our split with Chkheidze and Co.
began in Gazeta Robotnicza, and is Tyszka’s old, long
familiar
game.[3]

So what are we to do? Either we allow this game not only
to grow unhindered, but to seep through to our journal.
This is what the paragraph in the Japanese woman’s draft
Rules leads to! And it would mean a hopeless and final war
against Radek and Co.

You write, as though against me, that “it is not to our
advantage to quarrel with the Zimmerwald Left”.

I reply: if we are not to have a final quarrel with Radek
and Co. (and through them with others as well, should
things go badly), we must, for that very purpose, make
this kind of “game” and intrigue impossible in our journal.

That is just why I refuse to go along with the discussing
“contributors”, and refuse to join Kommunist.

It’s one of two things: if we agree to restore Kommunist,
it would mean opening the door to the development of that
intrigue; it would mean us opening the door to it. This
would be a mad policy, I am sure. Does the Japanese woman
understand all its implications? I don’t know, but that isn’t
very important: the “mechanics” of relations abroad would
itself lead to such a result, regardless of the malice or angelic
goodness and purity of the Japanese woman’s intentions.

The other prospect: not to revive Kommunist. To issue
another miscellany. Give the editors the right of discussion.
Analyse the national question. Beat off Gazeta Robotnicza’s
game and intrigue.

Radek or his friends attacked us in Gazeta Robotnicza.
We replied in our
miscellany,[4] only in ours, please note,
not in one published in common with the Zimmerwald Left of
other countries.
 

That’s where it ends.

The Zimmerwald Left, whom Radek tried without success
to drag into a quarrel with us at Kienthal (in talks with
Flatten and others, he wanted to deprive us of equality in
the main commission of the Left but the Left wouldn’t let
him do it)—these Zimmerwald Left have nothing to do with
the struggle between Gazeta Robotnicza and Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata.

The Zimmerwald Left cannot intervene in this struggle,
they cannot take offence and complain: Radek and Co. were
the first to attack in Gazeta Robotnicza, and they have
had their reply in Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata (or in some
other miscellany). In such a situation, no efforts by Radek
and Co. can conceivably bring about a quarrel between
ourselves and the Zimmerwald Left (just as at Kienthal Radek
failed to set us at loggerheads, either with Flatten or with
the German Left, though he did try to).

While Radek and Co. reply to us in the next issue of Gazeta
Robotnicza, and we to them in another miscellany (I insist
absolutely on agreements from miscellany to miscellany),
quite a lot of time will go by.

And during all that time, if that is the approach, Radek and
Co.’s dirty trick in Gazeta Robotnicza will not be able to
set us at loggerheads with the Left.

That is why I have said, and still say, that I will not on any
account now either join Kommunist, or accept equal rights
with the Japanese woman, or membership at all jointly
with Radek in our own miscellany, because I am convinced
that this will make inevitable a quarrel with the Left.

If we issue Kommunist No. 3,
then Radek and Bronski and
Pannekoek (and the general public) will have the right to
expect, and will expect, a continuation of the same thing;
they will have the right to expect, and will expect, all
possible guarantees for contributors; they will have the right,
finally (and this is particularly important), to take offence
and intervene if we reply there to Gazeta Robotnicza’s dirty
tricks. This throws the gates wide open to intrigue.

In that event, Radek and Co. will surely bring about a
quarrel between us and the Left, because even Pannekoek
will have the most sacred right to say: it wasn’t that
kind of Kommunist that I agreed to join, I don’t want

    

“attacks” on Gazeta Robotnicza (he will depict defence as
attack: you know how that’s done).

In that case, Radek and Co. will have the right to issue
any letter to the general public, both in Russian and in
German; they will have the right to say: Kommunist was in
practice (this is a fact) the common organ of yourselves+
Pannekoek+Radek+Bronski, while you use it to “offend”
Gazeta Robotnicza, you are beginning to split the Left, and
so on and so forth (as he had already been saying at
Kienthal, note that: he had already used this strategy at
Kienthal).

And in the eyes of the whole Left, the blame falls on us! We
allowed ourselves to be drawn into a quarrel with the Left,
we fell into the Tyszka trap. That is where continuing the
Kommunist leads to; that is why I refuse to go in.

Whereas on the contrary, I repeat, if—in a separate, new
miscellany, without Pannekoek, Radek, Bronski—we reply
to Gazeta Robotnicza, reply to Bukharin and anyone else,
this is absolutely no concern of the Zimmerwald Left, and they
cannot either interfere or take offence. Radek cannot “
complain” either to Pannekoek or to the Germans that Sbornik
Sotsial-Demokrata has replied to Gazeta Robotnicza.

And then, in addition, there is also the question of
defeatism. The same applies.

And then there is also the question of the Chkheidze group.
The same applies.
For that is what Gazeta Robotnicza was
playing on.

If the Japanese woman has no “evil intentions”, she cannot
reject an agreement on one miscellany (without Radek and
the others), when we provide for a discussion with the
Japanese and Bukharin. We are agreeable likewise to have it in
a separate pamphlet (if Bukharin wants it, for he will then
be able in advance to look at my “tone”, about which he has
expressed fears). It will then be possible to separate the
arguments with Bukharin from the joint work with Bukharin.

My articles and Grigory’s about defeatism, self–
determination, Gazeta Robotnicza’s dirty tricks, Chkheidze, “
self-defence”, etc., your articles about the “War Industries
Committees”, etc., Varin’s and Safarov’s (we mustn’t have
foreigners in this miscellany), etc., and whatever they please
from Bukharin and the Japanese.
 

There is the plan for an agreement on one miscellany.

The Japanese woman cannot refuse, unless she has evil
intentions.

One cannot insist on Kommunist, if it has fallen to
pieces; it is absurd and ridiculous to drag me by force into
Kommunist; they won’t succeed.

But if the Japanese woman won’t have an agreement on
a separate miscellany, that means she has evil intentions
or (which is all the same for the cause) her policy leads to an
evil intrigue.

And then we publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata alone.

All the best,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Dear Comrade Olga,

Inessa very badly needs a
passport.[1] We beg you to take
the enclosed letter to Guilbeaux (directeur de Demain, 28
rue du Marché, visitors on Fridays 2–4; perhaps it would be
better to ask him for an interview by postcard).

Of course don’t tell either him, or anyone else, who the
passport is for.

It is better to see Guilbeaux personally: we have thought
it over from every angle, and have decided that it would
be better than writing to him. I hope this request will not
give you or V. K. too much trouble.

Have you at your library the book by Yu. Delevsky (I
think that’s his name?): Class Contradictions within the
Modern Proletariat, or something like
that?[2]

If it’s not at your library, perhaps you know someone
who has it (and, by the way, do you happen to know the
exact title of the book?).

Best greetings to you both,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Nadya sends her regards.

July 25, 1916

Dear A. M.,

I was long in answering your letter because, owing to
Nadya’s illness, we’d had to move into the mountains. I quite
agree with you that the role of Left-winger at the conference
with Huysmans will, in the main, be one of collecting
information.[1] This is more important than anything else.
The most important thing is to make notes on the spot, and
about everything. Collect each and every kind of document;
and do not forget for a single minute the need for full
information. The only way is to write down everything (even if
briefly) at once, on the spot, in a special notebook. Grimm
is not going: they didn’t give him a passport. That means
there is to be only one Left-winger. This makes his
responsibility all the greater. It will take great resolution and full
political clarity to carry on the line alone: you are the best
judge of whether these qualities are there. If they are, it
would be a good thing to “put” a couple of questions to
the vote: approve Zimmerwald; ditto Kienthal; condemn
the social-patriots, Hyndman and Co., Sembat and Co.,
Legien and Co., Plekhanov and Co. The same thing can also
be done in the form of questions. It’ll be up to you to decide
whether this can be done.

Please drop me a couple of words about the receipt of
this postcard.

Alexander must have taken all the addresses with him,
and will try and find out whether anything has been printed
in America about the Zimmerwald Left and get it, and
contact the Socialist Propaganda League, the Socialist
Labour Party, International Socialist Review and Appeal to
    

Reason. If you get this postcard and reply, we may perhaps
have time to write each other about what precisely it is
convenient to ask him to do there.

One personal request: have you any publishing
connections? I have none. By way of earnings, I should like to have
either a translation, or an article on education for Nadya
(her illness requires a prolonged stay in the mountains, and
that is expensive).

Best greetings and good wishes. Nadya sends her regards.

Yours,
 V. Ulyanov

Dear Zina,

I read in Berner Tagwacht and heard that your lecture
at Olten was a great success. Ich
gratuliere![1]

Perhaps you
could write a brief summary of the main points for our 
Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata, if you were going to write on the
same subject? We are in a terribly difficult situation: we
failed to calculate beforehand the exact size of the articles,
we have “swollen up” out of all proportion, we have not been
able to “unload ”, and are now faced with the prospect of a
great big volume, which is least convenient for propaganda
from abroad.

Drop me a few words about your subject, and about
whether you could, without detriment to the subject, confine
yourself to 4–5 pages of our large size (you have it in the
proofs, and you will probably not find it too hard to
calculate precisely).

Write.

Beste Grüsse, especially to Styopka, who must have grown
so that I won’t be able to toss him up to the ceiling!

Dear G. L.,

I don’t know whether you are in Berne. Please let me know
directly you get this letter.

1) I have a request to you: I need to dispatch a
manuscript in bindings:
100 sheets (not pages but sheets) just like
this one (destination, same as
Grigory’s).[1]

Please order two books of suitable format: you will get the
manuscript in 5–6 days. I am in a terrible hurry with the
dispatch (I have lost my own copy!) and therefore would very
much ask you to hurry, and if you can’t do it, to reply as
soon as possible, so that I could look for someone else through
whom to arrange it.

2) Why do you say nothing about my papers? If you can’t
manage anything (or if it’s inconvenient), do not hesitate
to let me know. It isn’t worth while going to a lot of trouble
over it!

3) Did you get a printed copy of the “paper” on the Ts.
case[2] from Moor? This is essential. Don’t forget! We must
get hold of it at all costs, or he may lose it, the scoundrel!

4) Why has there not been a money report for a long time?
Or has there been such a windfall that you can’t add it up?

Greetings to all, from Lyuda on.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. Please send us the POW
letters,[3] after you are
through: we must keep track of their state of mind, demands,
opinions, etc.

At the time, G. L. Shklovsky headed the Commission for

Organisation Abroad. The Commission operated in Berne, and
Shklovsky kept Lenin informed of its activity and sent him the
most interesting POW letters. The commission was set up on
Lenin’s initiative and widely circulated Bolshevik literature on
various aspects of the war and current events, established ties
with POWs, and contacted revolutionary-minded men who helped
to spread the Party’s Influence in POW camps.

Please send the cash to Tribune, and ask them not to send

Dear Grisha,

And so the misunderstanding has been cleared up. It’s
not worth talking about it any more. It isn’t worth while
publishing in Paris under the censorship. If the possibility
of publishing without censorship definitely arises, then write,
in as much detail as you can.

We agree to a (provisional) editorial board for publishing
leaflets in Paris: Varin+Domov+1 from the Paris
group.[1]

The papers say that there is to be a conference of the
Entente socialists at the Palais Bourbon on Dec. 24, 1916. Find
out whether this is so. We shall send a leaflet from the
Central Committee, and you make as thorough preparations as
possible for publishing and distributing it in that event.

Many thanks for all you are sending us. Send and write
as much as you can.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In his earlier letters, G. Belenky, secretary of the Bolshevik
group in Paris, had suggested to Lenin that the publication of
the second issue of Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata should be organised
in Paris, but failed to say beforehand that the edition could only
be a legal one. The planned publication of leaflets in Paris was
not carried out.

I remember very well that the final drafting of this
amendment was preceded by prolonged negotiations directly
between ourselves and Bebel. The first draft made a much more
straightforward statement about revolutionary agitation
and revolutionary action. We showed it to Bebel; he replied:
I don’t accept it, because then the Public Prosecutor will
dissolve our party organisations, and we can’t have that,
as there are no serious developments as yet. After
consultation with legal specialists and numerous redraftings of the
text in order to give legal expression to the same idea, a
final formula was found which Bebel agreed to accept.

N. Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the amendments to Bebel’s resolution on
anti-militarism tabled at the Stuttgart Congress of the Second
International, held from August 18 to 23, 1907. Bebel’s resolution
had the basic defect of failing to state the active tasks of the
proletariat, which gave the opportunists (Vollmar and others) an
opportunity of reading it their own way. Accordingly, on behalf
of the Russian and Polish delegations, Rosa Luxemburg motioned
amendments to Bebel’s resolution which were signed by Lenin.
They =

1) said that militarism was the chief instrument of class
oppression; =

2) stated the task of carrying on agitation among the
youth, and =

3) emphasised the task of Social-Democrats not only
to struggle against the outbreak of wars or for the earliest halt to
wars, but also use the wartime crisis to speed the downfall of the
bourgeoisie. =

All these amendments were in the main included
in Bebel’s resolution and adopted by the Congress. For details,
see Lenin’s articles “The International Socialist Congress in
Stuttgart” (present edition, Vol. 13, pp. 75–81 and 82–93).

Today, Nobs and Münzenberg told me the following facts
which are not without significance.

On Jan. 7, Münzenberg proposed that the congress should
be postponed to March (clearly wishing by this proposition
to expose the hypocrisy of the arguments used by Grimm+
the social-patriots). It was
defeated.[2]

Greulich proposed postponement until May. Nobs stated
that he was in favour (once again choosing the lesser evil
and exposing the same crowd). When Nobs said that he was
for, Greulich (what a character!) immediately withdrew his
proposition (having seen his mistake). Then Naine declared
that he was moving Greulich’s proposal. It was defeated.

Münzenberg proposed that the cantonal committees (to
whom the matter has now been referred) should be allowed
time until July. It was defeated!

These facts show up Grimm’s unprecedented impudence,
when he says in his article (Berner Tagwacht of Jan. 8 or
9,
Parteibeschlüsse)[3] that the Left wing, too, were “in
principle” not against postponement!

Münzenberg has written an article for Volksrecht (Nobs hag
promised to insert it tomorrow or the day after) against the
decision of the
Partei-Vorstand.[1]
[4]


After reading this, send it on to Olga, for her to send
to Abramovich.

Social-Democratic Party of January 7 to postpone the
convocation of the congress indefinitely.

Dear Friend,

I enclose a resolution. Please read it and pass it on to
Guilbeaux and to the German group.

This resolution (it was voted here by a meeting of the
Left)[1] must be got through all possible organisations;
and, if it is adopted even by a small party organisation, it
should be sent officially both to the local party committee
and to the Central Executive (Geschäftsleitung der
sozialistischen Partei. Zürich. Volkshaus), with a demand that it be
published.

I am terribly angry with Guilbeaux—tell him this—for
failing to return to me the draft statement against
Grimm[2]
(has he shown it to you? He must!).

If he doesn’t want to sign it, let him send it back at once.

Best regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes

of 1917. The text of the resolution in German with Lenin’s
corrections is now at the Archives of the Institute of Marxism–
Leninism of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U. The resolution served
as a basis for the referendum which was held when local
organisations came out in favour of calling the congress in the spring
(Volksrecht No. 19, January 23, 1917, “Das Referendum gegen
den Parteivorstandsbeschluss ergriffen” (The Referendum against

Dear Comrade Olga,

Many thanks for your letter on affairs in your local party.
You are not alone, to tell the truth, in having bouts of
“pessimism”.[1] The party here is opportunist through and
through, a benevolent society for petty-bourgeois officials.

Even the alleged Left leaders (like Nobs and Flatten) are
no use at all: the said two in
particular.[2] You can’t do
anything without access to the masses. But while taking
care not to entertain excessive hopes, we should not fall into
pessimism either: this is an important moment, and if we
helped ever so little (a couple of leaflets or the like), that
would also be something. Even that will not be lost quite
without trace.

I am very glad that you have the intention to help in
every possible way in the distribution of the
leaflet.[3]
Please, don’t forget to destroy all our correspondence.

When is your cantonal congress of the Socialist Party?
I sent a draft resolution to Abramovich. Has he sent it on
to you? Do you know anything (apart from what was in
Volksrecht) about the congress of the Zurich party at
Toss?[4]

Who reported on the Olten meeting on
Feb. 1?[5] Only
Guilbeaux and Co.? They got the jitters, you know! They
failed to understand the task, and got scared!

I cannot lecture in French.

Every good wish of success. Regards to Vyacheslav
Alexeyevich.

Yours,
 Lenin

And how are things with the referendum? How many
signatures? Are they still collecting
them?[6]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Sophia Ravich wrote to Lenin about the opportunism of the
Geneva Social-Democratic organisation, among whose members
a handful of Bolsheviks spread internationalist ideas.





[2]
A reference to the attitude adopted by E. Nobs and F. Platten
during the sharpening of the struggle within the Swiss
Social-Democratic Party on the question of militarism and the
behaviour of Social-Democrats in Parliament on the question of
war credits. Thus, for instance, E. Nobs was against the
motivated referendum staged by the Left on an urgent convocation of a
congress. Both took part in a private meeting of Centrists held
on February 3, 1917 (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 283–86).





[3]
A reference to the leaflets published in Zurich by a group of Swiss,
German, Polish and Russian supporters of the Zimmerwald Left.
Lenin took part in editing Bulletin No. 1, organised its
translation into foreign languages and did everything to circulate it.





[4]
The Cantonal Congress of the Zurich Social-Democratic
organisation in Toss was held on February 11 and 12, 1917. The Party
organ, Volksrecht No. 36, of February 12, 1917, dealt with it in an
editorial, entitled “Der Parteitag in Töss” (Party Congress at Toss).

Two draft resolutions on the war question were tabled at the
Congress: =

1) that of the minority of the war commission drawn up by
the Right in a spirit of social-chauvinism; and =

2) the Centrist draft
of the majority. The Congress adopted the latter by 93 to 65. To
prevent the social-chauvinist resolution from going through, the
Left voted for the majority resolution but tabled Lenin’s “
Proposed Amendments to the Resolution on-the War Issue”, which
was adopted by the Congress.





[5]
On February 1, 1917, a meeting of some members of the
Zimmerwald Conference was held at Olten with the participation of
organisations invited to attend a conference of socialists from the
Entente countries (March 1917) (see present edition, Vol. 23,
p. 284).





[6]
The referendum on the convocation of an extraordinary congress
of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party to discuss the attitude to
the war was announced by the Swiss Left-wing Social-Democrats
in connection with the Executive’s decision to postpone the
congress indefinitely. Despite the struggle started by the leaders of
the party, R. Grimm, J. Schmid, F. Schneider, H. Greulich and
G. Müller (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 283–86), against the
referendum, it was enthusiastically welcomed by the workers
of German– and French-speaking Switzerland. But the party
congress was held only in June 1917.

Martov’s plan is a good
one[1]: it’s necessary to work for
it, but we (and you) cannot do this directly. We shall be
open to suspicion. It’s necessary that, in addition to
Martov, non-Party Russians and patriotic Russians should
approach Swiss Ministers (and influential people, lawyers,
etc., something that can be done in Geneva as well)
requesting them to have a talk about it with the German
Government’s Ambassador at Berne. We cannot take part, either
directly or indirectly; our participation will spoil it all.
But the plan, in itself, is a very good one and is very right.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
At a conference of representatives of Russian political parties at
Geneva on March 19, 1917, L. Martov proposed a plan to secure
the passage of political émigrés via Germany in exchange for the
same number of Germans and Austrians interned in Russia. All
participants in the meeting recognised Martov’s plan as being the
best and most acceptable.

The plan was discussed in émigré circles and was adopted by the
C.C. of the R.S.D.L.P. at the end of March (see present edition,
Vol. 24, pp. 27–29; Lenin Miscellany II, 1924, pp. 385–94).

from the Manifesto carried by Frankfurter Zeitung No. 80, March 
22, 1917, under the title, “Das Manifest der Sozialrevolutionäre”
(Manifesto of Revolutionary Socialists). It demanded a democratic
republic, an 8-hour working day, confiscation of landed estates in
favour of the peasants, confiscation of grain stocks, and—the most
important thing—an end to the plunderous war. On the
significance of the Manifesto, see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 320 and

[3]
Lenin read his lecture, “The Russian Revolution, Its Significance
and Its Tasks”, in German at a meeting of Swiss workers at People’s
House in Zurich on March 27, 1917.

The basic propositions outlined in the plan for a lecture were
elaborated by Lenin in his famous Letters from Afar (see present
edition, Vol. 23, pp. 295–342). A brief account of the lecture
appeared in the Zurich newspaper Volksrecht Nos. 77 and 78
on March 31 and April 2, 1917 (see present edition, Vol. 23,
pp. 355–61).





[4]
A reference to the decision of the Petrograd Soviet of March 2
(15), which approved, against the “protests of the minority”,
Kerensky’s unauthorised entry into the bourgeois Provisional
Government as Minister of Justice.





[5]
For Thesis No. 4 on the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, see Lenin’s
article “Several Theses” (see present edition, Vol. 21, p. 402).





[6]
The teaching of Marx and Engels on the state in the transitional
period was set forth in detail in The Critique of the Gotha
Programme (see Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol. II, Moscow,
1962, pp. 32–33).





[7]
For Thesis No. 11, see Lenin’s article “Several Theses”, which
was published in Sotsial-Demokrat No. 47, October 13, 1915
(see present edition, Vol. 21, pp. 403–04).

National Councillor
Grimm[1]

Our Party has decided to accept without reservations
the proposal that the Russian émigrés should travel through
Germany, and to organise this journey at
once.[2] We
already expect to have more than ten participants in the
journey.

We absolutely decline responsibility for any further delay,
resolutely protest against it and are going alone. We
earnestly request you to make the arrangements immediately and,
if possible, let us know the decision tomorrow.

With gratitude,
 Lenin, Zinoviev, Ulyanova

Dear Friends,

I attach the decision of our Party’s Central
Committee[1]
(the Karpinskys, after taking 2 copies, must immediately
return this decision to me). Immediately take a copy (for
yourselves) and send it to the Karpinskys express by the first
train (take it to the station), enclosing also this letter of mine.

Inform Lausanne
(Goberman)[2] specially.

I will add for myself that I consider the Mensheviks who
have wrecked the common enterprise scoundrels of the
first water who are “afraid” of what “public opinion”,
i.e., the social-patriots, will
say![3] I am going (and
Zinoviev) in any case.

Find out exactly (1) who is going and (2) how much
money they have.

Write about this at once to Radomyslsky, Neufeldstr.
27. Bern.

We already have a fund of over 1,000 francs for the
journey. We are thinking of fixing Wednesday, April 4, as the
day of departure.

All should immediately take passports from the Russian
Consul at their place of residence.

Regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Send copies at once to Abram and his wife.

P.S. I enclose the 100 francs which you asked Grigory to
lend you.

On March 31, 1917, the Central Committee Collegium Abroad
adopted a decision on the immediate return of the émigrés to
Russia via Germany (see present edition, Vol. 23, pp. 365–66).

M. Goberman—Social-Democrat, Bolshevik, member of the
Bolshevik group in Lausanne. Abram (mentioned below)—A. Skovno—
Bolshevik, member of the Bolshevik group in Switzerland. Both
returned to Russia with Lenin.

A reference to the resolution of the internationalist Mensheviks
and S.R.s, aimed against the decision of the C.C. Collegium Abroad
to accept R. Grimm’s proposal to travel immediately to Russia
via Germany. The Mensheviks and the S.R.s wanted to wait for
permission from the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies.

MINUTES

In order to put an end to the lies being spread by the
bourgeois press, it is essential to adopt the resolution proposed by
Comrade Zinoviev. He proposes a statement that émigrés
of all trends should be allowed through. We undertook no
obligations at all. We only promised that on our return we
would appeal to the workers to help the exchange. If you
recognise that exchange is right, you will thereby refute all
the lies. Otherwise you will give food for insinuation and
slander....

I have put down a few theses on which I will make some
comments. For lack of time I was unable to present a
circumstantial and systematic report.

The basic question is the attitude to the war. The main
thing that comes to the fore, when you read about Russia
and see what goes on here, is the victory of defencism, the
victory of the traitors to socialism, the deception of the
masses by the bourgeoisie. What strikes one is that here in
Russia the socialist movement is in the same state as in other
countries: defencism, “defence of the fatherland”. The
difference is that nowhere is there such freedom as here, and
therefore we have a special responsibility to the whole
international proletariat. The new government is as imperialist as
the previous one; it is imperialist through and through,
despite its promise of a republic.

“I. In our attitude towards the war, which under the
new government of Lvov and Co. unquestionably remains on
Russia’s part a predatory imperialist war owing to the
capitalist nature of that government, not the slightest
concession to ‘revolutionary defencism’ is permissible.

“The class-conscious proletariat can give its consent to a
revolutionary war, which would really justify revolutionary
defencism, only on condition:
a) that power passes to the
proletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants aligned
with the proletariat;
b) that all annexations are renounced in
deed and not in word;
c) that a complete break is effected
in actual fact with all capitalist interests. 
 

“In view of the undoubted honesty of those broad sections
of the mass believers in revolutionary defencism who
accept the war only as a necessity, and not as a means of
conquest, in view of the fact that they are being deceived by
the bourgeoisie, it is necessary with particular thoroughness,
persistence and patience to explain their error to them, to
explain the inseparable connection existing between
capital and the imperialist war, and to prove that without
overthrowing capital it is impossible to end the war by a truly
democratic peace, a peace not imposed by violence.

“The most widespread campaign for this view must be
organised in the army at the front.

“Fraternisation.”

We cannot allow the slightest concession to defencism in
our attitude to the war even under the new government,
which remains imperialist. The masses lake a practical
and not a theoretical view of things. They say: “I want to
defend the fatherland, not to seize other peoples’ lands.”
When can a war be considered your own? When annexations
are completely renounced.

The masses take a practical and not a theoretical
approach to the question. We make the mistake of taking the
theoretical approach. A class-conscious proletarian can agree
to a revolutionary war, which really does justify revolutionary
defencism. The practical approach is the only possible one
with representatives of the mass of the soldiers. We are not
pacifists in any sense. But the main question is: which class
is carrying on the war? The class of capitalists, linked with
the banks, cannot wage any kind of war except an
imperialist one. The working class can. Steklov and Chkheidze have
forgotten everything. When you read the resolution of the
Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, you are amazed that people
calling themselves socialists could adopt such a
resolution.[6]

What is specific in Russia is the extremely rapid
transition from savage violence to the most subtle deception. The
main condition is renunciation of annexations not in words,
but in deeds. Rech howls at Sotsial-Demokrat’s statement
that the integration of Courland with Russia is annexation.
But annexation is the integration of any country with
distinct national peculiarities; it is any integration of a nation
against its will, irrespective of whether it differs in language,

    

if it feels itself to be another people. This is a prejudice of
the Great Russians which has been fostered for centuries.

The war can be ended only by a clean break with
international capital. The war was engendered not by individuals
but by international finance capital. It is no easy thing to
break with international capital, but neither is it an easy
thing to end the war. It is childishness and naivete to
expect one side alone to end the war.... Zimmerwald,
Kienthal[7].... We have a greater obligation than anyone else
to safeguard the honour of international socialism. The
difficulty of approach....

In view of the undoubted existence of a defencist mood
among the masses, who recognise the war only of necessity
and not for the sake of conquest, we must explain to them
most circumstantially, persistently and patiently that the
war cannot be ended in a non-rapacious peace unless capital
is overthrown. This idea must be spread far and wide.
The soldiers want a concrete answer: how to end the war.
But it is political fraud to promise the people that we can
end the war only by the goodwill of individual persons.
The masses must be forewarned. A revolution is a difficult
thing. It is impossible to avoid mistakes. Our mistake is
that we (have not exposed?) revolutionary defencism to
the full. Revolutionary defencism is betrayal of socialism.
We cannot confine ourselves.... We must admit our
mistake. What is to be done? To explain. How to present... who
doesn’t know what socialism is.... We are not charlatans.
We must base ourselves only on the political consciousness
of the masses. Even if we have to remain in a minority—let
it be so. It is worth while giving up our leading position
for a time; we should not be afraid of remaining in
a minority. When the masses say they don’t want conquest,
I believe them. When Guchkov and Lvov say they don’t
want conquest, they are swindlers. When the worker says
that he wants to defend the country, he voices the oppressed
man’s instinct.

“II. The specific feature of the present situation in
Russia is that the country is passing from the first stage of the
revolution—which, owing to the insufficient class–
consciousness and organisation of the proletariat, placed power
in the hands of the bourgeoisie—to the second stage, which

    

must place power in the hands of the proletariat and the
poorest sections of the peasants.

“This transition is characterised, on the one hand, by
a maximum of legally recognised rights (Russia is now the
freest of all the belligerent countries in the world); on the
other, by the absence of violence towards the masses, and,
finally, by their unreasoning trust in the government of
capitalists, those worst enemies of peace and socialism.

“This peculiar situation demands of us an ability to adapt
ourselves to the special conditions of Party work among
unprecedentedly large masses of proletarians who have
just awakened to political life.”

Why didn’t they take power? Steklov says: for this
reason and that. This is nonsense. The fact is that the
proletariat is not organised and class-conscious enough. This
must be admitted; material strength is in the hands of the
proletariat, but the bourgeoisie turned out to be prepared
and class-conscious. This is a monstrous fact, but it should
be frankly and openly admitted, and the people should
be told that they didn’t take power because they were
unorganised and not conscious enough.... The ruin of millions,
the death of millions. The most advanced countries are on
the brink of disaster, and they will therefore be faced with
the question....

The transition from the first stage to the second—the
transfer of power to the proletariat and the peasantry—is
characterised, on the one hand, by the maximum of
legality (Russia today is the freest and most progressive
country in the world) and, on the other, by an attitude of
blind trust on the part of the masses in the government.
Even our Bolsheviks show some trust in the government.
This can be explained only by the intoxication of the
revolution. It is the death of socialism. You comrades have
a trusting attitude to the government. If that is so, our
paths diverge. I prefer to remain in a minority. One
Liebknecht is worth more than 110 defencists of the Steklov and
Chkheidze type. If you sympathise with Liebknecht and
stretch out even a finger (to the defencists), it will be
betrayal of international socialism. If we break away from those
people ... everyone who is oppressed will come to us,
because the war will lead him to us; he has no other way out.
 

The people should be spoken to without Latin words,
in clear and simple terms. They have the right ...—we
must adapt ourselves ... make the change, but it is
essential. Our line will prove to be the correct one.

“III. No support for the Provisional Government; the
utter falsity of all its promises should be made clear,
particularly of those relating to the renunciation of
annexations. Exposure in place of the impermissible,
illusion-breeding ‘demand’ that this government, a government
of capitalists, should cease to be an imperialist
government. ”

Pravda demands of the government that it should renounce
annexations. To demand of a government of capitalists
that it should renounce annexations is nonsense, a crying
mockery of....

From the scientific standpoint this is such gross
deception which all the international proletariat, all.... It is
time to admit our mistake. We’ve had enough of greetings
and resolutions, it is time to act. We must get down to a
sober, business-like....

“IV. Recognition of the fact that in most of the Soviets
of Workers’ Deputies our Party is in a minority, so far a
small minority, as against a bloc of all the petty-bourgeois
opportunist elements, from the Popular
Socialists[8] and
the Socialist-Revolutionaries down to the Organising
Committee (Chkheidze, Tsereteli, etc.), Steklov, etc., etc., who
have yielded to the influence of the bourgeoisie and spread
that influence among the proletariat.

“The masses must be made to see that the Soviets of
Workers’ Deputies are the only possible form of
revolutionary government, and that therefore our task is, as long
as this government yields to the influence of the
bourgeoisie, to present a patient, systematic, and persistent 
explanation of the errors of their tactics, an explanation
especially adapted to the practical needs of the masses.

“As long as we are in the minority we carry on the work
of criticising and exposing errors and at the same time
we preach the necessity of transferring the entire state power
to the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, so that the people
may overcome their mistakes by experience.”

We Bolsheviks are in the habit of taking the line of

    

maximum revolutionism. But that is not enough. We must sort
things out.

The Soviet of Workers’ Deputies is the real government.
To think otherwise is to fall into anarchism. It is a
recognised fact that in the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies our
Party is in a minority. We must explain to the masses
that the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies is the only possible
government, a government without parallel in the world,
except for the Commune. What if a majority of the Soviet
of Workers’ Deputies takes the defencist stand? That
cannot be helped. It remains for us to explain, patiently,
persistently, systematically, the erroneous nature of their
tactics.

So long as we are in a minority, we carry on the work
of criticism, in order to open the people’s eyes to the
deception. We don’t want the masses to take our word for it. We
are not charlatans. We want the masses to overcome their
mistakes through experience.

The manifesto of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies
contains not a word imbued with class-consciousness. It’s all
talk! Talk, flattery of the revolutionary people, is the
only thing that has ruined all revolutions. The whole of
Marxism teaches us not to succumb to revolutionary
phrases, particularly at a time when they have the greatest
currency.

“V. Not a parliamentary republic—to return to a
parliamentary republic from the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies
would be a retrograde step—but a republic of Soviets of
Workers’, Agricultural Labourers’ and Peasants’ Deputies
throughout the country, from top to bottom.

“Abolition of the police, the army and the
bureaucracy.[1]


“The salaries of all officials, all of whom are elective
and displaceable at any time, not to exceed the average
wage of a competent worker.”

This is the lesson of the French Commune, which Kautsky
forgot and which the workers teach us in 1905 and 1917.
The experience of these years teaches us that we must not
allow the police and the old army to be restored.
 

The programme should be changed, it is out of date.
The Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies is a step to
socialism. There must be no police, no army, no
officialdom. The convocation of the Constituent Assembly—but
by whom? Resolutions are written only to be shelved or
sat on. I should be glad to have the Constituent Assembly
convened tomorrow, but it is naïve to believe that
Guchkov will call it. All the chatter about forcing the
Provisional Government to call the Constituent Assembly is empty
talk, a pack of lies. Revolutions were made, but the police
stayed on, revolutions were made, but all the officials,
etc., stayed on. That was why the revolutions foundered.
The Soviet of Workers’ Deputies is the only government
which can call that assembly. We all seized upon the
Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, but have failed to
understand them. From this form we are dragging back to the
International, which is trailing behind the bourgeoisie.

A bourgeois republic cannot solve the problem (of the
war), because it can be solved only on an international
scale. We don’t promise liberation ... but we say that
it is possible only in this form (Soviet of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies). No government except the Soviet of
Workers’ and Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies. If you
talk about the Commune, they won’t understand. But if
you say, there is the Soviet of Workers’ and Agricultural
Labourers’ Deputies instead of the police, learn to govern—
no one can interfere with us—(that they will understand).

No books will ever teach you the art of government.
Learning to govern is a matter of trial and error.

“VI. The weight of emphasis in the agrarian programme to
be shifted to the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.

“Confiscation of all landed estates.

“Nationalisation of all lands in the country, the land to
be disposed of by the local Soviets of Agricultural
Labourers’ and Peasants’ Deputies. The organisation of separate
Soviets of Deputies of Poor Peasants. The setting up of a
model farm on each of the large estates (ranging in size
from 100 to 300 dessiatines, according to local and other
conditions and to the decisions of the local bodies) under
the control of the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’
Deputies and for the public account.”
 

What is the peasantry? We don’t know, there are no
statistics, but we do know that it is a force.

If they take the land, you can be sure that they won’t
give it back to you, they won’t ask us. The pivot, the
centre of gravity of the programme has shifted, and is
the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies. If the
Russian peasant doesn’t settle the revolution, the
German worker will.

The Tambov muzhik....

The first dessiatine cost free, the second, for 1 ruble,
the third, for 2 rubles. We shall take over the land, and
the landowner will never be able to take it back.

Communal farming.

It is necessary to organise separate Soviets of Deputies
from the poor peasants. There is the rich muzhik, and there
is the labourer. Even if you give him land, he won’t set
up a farm. The large estates should be turned into model
farms run on social lines, with management by the Soviets
of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.


There are large estates.

“VII. The immediate amalgamation of all banks in the
country into a single national bank, and the institution
of control over it by the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies.”

The bank is “a form of social book-keeping” (Marx).
War teaches economy; everyone knows that the banks
sap the strength of the people. The banks are the
nerve, the focus of the national economy. We cannot
take hold of the banks, but we advocate their
amalgamation under the control of the Soviet of Workers’
Deputies.

“VIII. It is not our immediate task to ‘introduce’
socialism, but only to bring social production and the
distribution of products at once under the control of the Soviets
of Workers’ Deputies.”

Practice and the revolution tend to push the Constituent
Assembly into the background. The important thing about
laws is not that they are put down on paper, but who
carries them out. The dictatorship of the proletariat is there,
but people don’t know how to work it. Capitalism has
developed into state capitalism.... Marx ... only that which
has matured in practice....
 

“IX. Party tasks:

(a) Immediate convocation of a Party congress.

(b) Amendment of the Party Programme, mainly:

1) On the question of imperialism and the
imperialist war;

2) On our attitude towards the state and our
demand for a “commune
 state”[2]

;



3) Amendment of our out-of-date minimum
programme.

(c) Change of the Party’s
name.[3]


“X. A new International.

“We must take the initiative in creating a revolutionary
International, an International against the social–
chauvinists and against the ‘
Centre’.[4]

”



General conclusion.

The Soviet of Workers’ Deputies has been created, it
enjoys vast influence. All instinctively sympathise with
it. This institution combines far more revolutionary thought
than all the revolutionary phrases. If the Soviet of
Workers’ Deputies succeeds in taking government into its own
hands, the cause of liberty is assured. You may write the
most ideal laws, but who will put them into effect? The
same officials, but they are tied up with the bourgeoisie.

It is not “introduce socialism” that we ought to tell
the masses, but put it into effect (?). Capitalism has gone
ahead, war capitalism is different from that which existed
before the war.

On the basis of our tactical conclusions we must go on
to practical steps. A Party congress must be called at once
and the Programme revised. A great deal in it is out of
date. The minimum programme must be changed.
 

I personally propose that we change the name of our
Party and call it the Communist Party. The people will
understand the name of “Communist”. Most of the official
Social-Democrats have committed treason, they have
betrayed socialism.... Liebknecht is the one Social–
Democrat.... You are afraid of betraying old recollections. But
if you want to change your underwear you must take off
your dirty shirt and put on a clean one. Why throw out
the experience of world-wide struggle? Most of the
Social-Democrats throughout the world have betrayed socialism,
and have sided with their governments (Scheidemann,
Plekhanov, Guesde). What is to be done to make Scheidemann
agree?... This point of view spells ruin for socialism. It
would be deception to send a radio telegram to Scheidemann
about ending the war....

The term “Social-Democracy” is inexact. Don’t cling
to an old word which has become rotten through and
through. If you want to build a new party ... and all the
oppressed will come to you.

The Centre prevailed at Zimmerwald and Kienthal....
Rabochaya Gazeta. We shall prove to you that the whole of
experience has shown.... We declare that we have formed
a Left wing and have broken with the Centre. Either you
speak about the International, then carry out..., or you....

The Left Zimmerwald trend exists in all the countries
of the world. The masses must realise that socialism has
split throughout the world. The defencists have renounced
socialism. Liebknecht alone.... The future is with him.

I have heard that there is a tendency in Russia towards
unification, towards unity with the defencists. This is
betrayal of socialism. I think it is better to remain alone,
like Liebknecht: one against 110.

people.—Lenin

[2]
That is, a state of which the Paris Commune was the prototype.—Lenin

[3]
We must call ourselves the Communist Party, instead
of “Social-Democratic”, for the official Social-Democrat leaders
throughout the world have betrayed socialism and have gone over to
the bourgeoisie (the “defencists” and wavering “Kautskians”).—Lenin

[4]

 “Centre” is the name given among international
Social-Democrats to the trend which wavers between the chauvinists (=the
“defencists”) and the internationalists, namely, Kautsky and Co.
in Germany; Longuet and Co. in France; Chkheidze and Co. in
Russia; Turati and Co. in Italy; MacDonald and Co. in Britain, etc.—Lenin

All-Russia Conference of Party Workers (March Conference) was
timed by the Russian Bureau of the R.S.D.L.P. C.C. for the
All-Russia Conference of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies and opened on March 27 (April 9), 1917. On its agenda were:
attitude to the war, attitude to the Provisional Government,
organisation of revolutionary forces, etc.

The meeting of April 4 (17) at which Lenin gave his report was
held in the Taurida Palace. Lenin explained his April Theses and
quoted them in part. The text of his speech is reproduced from
secretarial notes containing lacunae indicated with dots, apart
from some places of the notes which are not quite clear.

All-Russia Conference of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies, called by the Executive Committee of the Petrograd
Soviet, was held at Petrograd from March 29 to April 3 (April 
11 to 16), 1917.

It was attended by representatives of the Petrograd Soviet
and 82 local Soviets, and also of army units at the front and in
the rear. It discussed the questions of the war, the attitude to the
Provisional Government, the Constituent Assembly, land, food, and
other problems.

The Conference, which was dominated by Mensheviks and S.R.s,
took the attitude of “revolutionary defencism” (325 against 57)
and adopted a decision to support the bourgeois Provisional
Government and also to call an international socialist conference
on the question of withdrawal from the war. G. V. Plekhanov
made two speeches in a spirit of social-patriotism. There were
interruptions from the defencist majority when the Bolshevik
P. I. Starostin called for an end to the war.

The Conference added 16 members to the Executive Committee
of the Petrograd Soviet, including six from the Army and Navy.

A reference to a resolution on Tsereteli’s report on the attitude
towards the war, tabled by the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’
and Soldiers’ Deputies, controlled by Mensheviks and S.R.s,
and adopted by the All-Russia Conference of Soviets of Workers’
and Soldiers’ Deputies on March 30 (April 12), 1917. Behind a
facade of general statements about freedom and defence of the
revolution, the resolution urged support for the Provisional
Government’s foreign policy, i.e., continuation of the imperialist war.

Popular Socialists—members of a petty-bourgeois Trudovik

   

Popular Socialist Party formed in 1906 by Right-wingers of the
Socialist-Revolutionary Party (S.R.). They sided with the Cadets;
Lenin called them “Social-Cadets”, “philistine opportunists”,
“S.R. Mensheviks”, vacillating between the S.R.s and the Cadets.
He said, the party “differs very little from the Cadets, for it
deletes from its programme both republicanism and the demand
for all the land” =

(see present edition, Vol. 11, p. 228). Among
the party’s leaders were A. V. Peshekhonov, N. F. Annensky
and V. A. Myakotin.

Comrades Hanecki and Radek: Herrn Fürstenberg
    8. Birgerjarlsgatan. 8. Stockholm

April 12, 1917

Dear Friends,

Up to now we have received nothing, absolutely nothing
from you—no letters, no packets, no
money.[1] Only two
telegrams from Hanecki. We are sending you two files of
Pravda: one for you, the other for Karpinsky (Mr. 
Karpinsky. Bibliothèque russe. 7. rue Hugo de Senger. 7. Genève.
(Genf) Suisse), and two sets of cuttings: one for you, the
other for Karpinsky.

Notify us by postcard (M. T. Yelizarov for V. I.
Shirokaya Ul., 48, kv. 24. Petrograd) or by telegram that
you have received this letter and the papers.

Steinberg[2] has arrived, and promises to get hold of
the packets which were sent. We shall see whether he
succeeds.

If you get the newspapers, they will give you an idea of
the whole situation.

In case the papers don’t reach you, let me describe it
in brief.

The bourgeoisie (+Plekhanov) are furiously attacking
us for travelling through Germany. They are trying to
incite the soldiers against us. So far it isn’t coming off: there
are supporters, and loyal ones, among them. Among the
S.R.s and the Social-Democrats there is the most desperate
chauvinist excitement, which has taken the form of
“revolutionary defencism ” (now, they allege, there is
something to defend, namely, the republic against Wilhelm).

    

We are being furiously attacked for opposing “unity”,
while the masses are for the unity of all Social-Democrats.
We are against.

Chkheidze has sunk completely into “revolutionary
defencism”. In a bloc with Potresov. All are for the Liberty
Loan.[3] It is opposed only by us+the Nashe Slovo group+
Larin and a handful of Martov’s friends.

We are calling an all-Russia conference of Bolsheviks
on April 22,
1917.[4]

We hope completely to straighten out the line of Pravda,
which has wobbled towards
“Kautskyism”.[5]

Write articles for Pravda on foreign affairs—very short
and in the Pravda spirit (it’s so small! There is so little
space! We are working to enlarge it). Also, most briefly,
about the German revolutionary movement and the Leftist
press.

Write us a letter about the doings among the Swedish
Left.[6] We have heard that the chauvinist Branting is
attacking Radek.

At the beginning of the revolution, the Soviet of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies concluded an agreement with
the Provisional Government for support of the
latter.[7]
There is a “Contact Commission”: the Soviet “supervises”
the Provisional Government.

The position is extremely complex and exceptionally
interesting. We are publishing pamphlets on
tactics.[8]
The Soviet wants a general, international socialist congress.
We want only a congress of the Left, against the
social-chauvinists and against the “Centre”.

I shake your hands, and wish you all the best. Write as
often as you can and be very regular and careful in your
contacts.

Yours,
 V. Ulyanov

Committee which had been left abroad.

Steinberg—a Russian engineer resident in Stockholm, a
go-between in the correspondence.

The “Liberty Loan” issued by the Provisional Government on
April 6 (19), 1917 to finance the war.

The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)
was held in Petrograd from April 24 to 29 (May 7–12), 1917.





[5]
A reference to the altitude taken by Pravda in March 1917 before
Lenin’s arrival in Russia.

From mid-March, the paper carried articles by L. Kamenev,
whom the C.C. Bureau of the R.S.D.L.P. gave permission to
insert articles without signature. In these articles, the question of
supporting the Provisional Government was presented in the light
of the Menshevik formula “insofar as...”, “until the Provisional
Government is played out”. They guaranteed support for all its
steps designed to “eradicate all the relics of the tsarist and
landowner regime ”; the government was invited to renounce
annexations, etc.—all of which tended to sow illusions. Kamenev’s
editorial, “Without Secret Diplomacy”, called for a continuation
of the war, a stand which clashed with the Bolshevik attitude
to the imperialist war.

Pravda’s criticism of the conciliators was half-hearted. The
editors sharply cut down Lenin’s criticism of the conciliatory
leadership of the Petrograd Soviet and his exposure of the
monarchist aspirations of the Provisional Government in his first
“Letter from Afar” carried by Pravda on March 21 and 22 (April 
3 and 4). J. V. Stalin took the erroneous position of exerting
pressure on the Provisional Government for an immediate opening
of peace talks.

Upon his arrival in Petrograd, Lenin became a member of the
editorial board, and Pravda started its struggle for his plan to
transform the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist
one.





[6]
A trend among Swedish Social-Democrats. During the First World
War, they took an internationalist stand and supported the

   

Zimmerwald Left. In May 1917 they formed the Left
Social-Democratic Party of Sweden whose congress in 1919 decided
to join the Communist International. In 1921, the party’s
revolutionary wing took the name of the Communist Party of
Sweden.





[7]
A reference to the agreement to form the bourgeois Provisional
Government concluded on March 1 (14), 1917 by the Duma
Provisional Committee and the S.R. and Menshevik leaders of the
Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies. Under the agreement the S.R.s and the
Mensheviks handed over state power to the bourgeoisie, giving the
Duma Provisional Committee a free hand in forming the Provisional
Government, which was set up on March 2 (15), 1917. It included
Prince Lvov, the Cadet leader Milyukov, the Octobrist leader
Guchkov and other representatives of the bourgeoisie and the
landowners. The S.R. Kerensky was taken into the government as a
representative of “democracy”.

The “contact commission” referred to below was formed under
a decision of the conciliatory Executive Committee of the
Petrograd Soviet of March 8 (21), 1917, to “influence” and supervise
the activity of the Provisional Government. On it were M. I.
Skobelev, Y. M. Steklov, N. N. Sukhanov, V. N. Filippovsky and
N. S. Chkheidze (later also V. M. Chernov and I. G. Tsereteli).
It helped the Provisional Government use the Petrograd Soviet
prestige to veil its counter-revolutionary policy. The Mensheviks
and S.R.s hoped it would help them keep the masses from active
revolutionary struggle for transfer of power to the Soviets. The
commission was dissolved in mid-April 1917 and its functions
transferred to the Executive Committee Bureau.

       Theses

1) Peace without annexations
a world revolution
 against capital,



2) Revision of the treaty
either a farce, or a
 world revolution
 against capital.



“Steps for an agreement
 with the Allies.”

2 bis) Puffing the
capitalists: “Allied
democracies”: glossing over the
class struggle.

3) All land to the peasants —

this can be realised even
 without a revolution
 against capital, by means
 of a bloc, an alliance of
 the capitalists and the
 rich peasants.

4) All land to the working people —

this cannot be
 realised without a
 revolution against
 capital.



5) Organisation of production —

either a fraud (and
 more enrichment for the
 capitalists) or a utopia
 without a revolution
 against capital.



6) “An offensive” —

a utopia without the greatest
 revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses,

    

which can flow only from the
greatest revolution, a revolution
against capital.



7) Departure from the Soviets,
 betrayal of them,
 transition to bureaucracy:
 “state control”, we are for. But by whom?
 Who is to exercise control?
 Officials?
 Or the Soviets?

8) Constituent Assembly on land:

already out of date

9) No confidence and no support!

10) Even more strongly: explanation of the 
proletarian line, drawing a distinction between it and
the petty-bourgeois line

σσ=a Ministry of petty-bourgeois illusions and
petty-bourgeois compromise.

Frederik Borgbjerg—a Danish reformist and a leader of the Danish
Social-Democratic Party. In the spring of 1917 he came to
Petrograd with the proposal to organise a conference of socialists
from the belligerent countries. Lenin exposed the imperialist
nature of his proposal and called Borgbjerg “an agent of the
German Government”. On Lenin’s initiative the April Conference
came out resolutely against the proposal (see present edition,
Vol. 24, pp. 247–50, 251–53).

A possible reference to Vasilyevsky Ostrov, which by that time
had had its elections to the district Soviet; following this, the
defencists, who were left in a minority, refused to submit to the
majority and twice (April 28 and May 2) walked out from the
meetings and disrupted the proceedings.

First All-Russia Congress of Peasants’ Deputies, held at
Petrograd from May 4 to 28 (May 17–June 10), 1917, was attended
by 1,115 delegates from the gubernias and army units. The
Bolsheviks took an active part in the proceedings and exposed the
imperialist policy of the bourgeois Provisional Government and
the conciliatory policy of the Mensheviks and the S.R.s. On May 
22 (June 4) Lenin delivered a speech on the agrarian question (see
present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 486–505). However, all the Congress
decisions bore the mark of S.R. domination. The Congress approved
the policy of the bourgeois Provisional Government and the
entry of “socialists” into the Provisional Government. It called
for a continuation of the war “to a victorious end” and an
offensive at the front. It came out against the immediate transfer of
landed estates to the peasants and postponed the solution of the
land question until a Constituent Assembly.

[1]
First All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies was held in Petrograd from June 3 to 24 (June 16 to July 
7), 1917. It was attended by more than 1,000 delegates. The
Bolsheviks, who were then in a minority in the Soviets, had 105 
delegates. The S.R.s and Mensheviks were in the majority. On the
agenda were the following questions: the attitude to the
Provisional Government, the war, preparations for a Constituent
Assembly, etc. Lenin spoke on the attitude to the Provisional
Government and on the war (see present edition, Vol. 25, pp. 17–28 and
29–42). The Bolsheviks motioned resolutions on all the major
questions. They exposed the imperialist nature of the war, the
danger of conciliation with the bourgeoisie and demanded the transfer
of all power to the Soviets. The Congress decisions supported the
Provisional Government, approved of the offensive then being
prepared for and opposed the transfer of power to the Soviets.
This may be the original plan of Lenin’s speech at the Congress
or of an article which he did not have the time to write.





[2]
A reference to the “new”, coalition Provisional Government
which was formed on May 5 (18), 1917, and which began to
function officially the following day. Together with representatives
of the bourgeoisie it included the S.R.s Kerensky and Chernov,
Pereverzev who was close to the S.R.s, the Mensheviks Skobelev
and Tsereteli and the Popular Socialist Peshekhonov.

A conference of members of the Fourth Duma on May 20 (June 2),
1917 decided to support the postponement of the land reform
until the convocation of a Constituent Assembly.

By “Peasant Soviet” is meant the first All-Russia Congress

   

of Peasants’ Deputies, which under the influence of the S.R.
majority also put off the solution of the land question until the
convocation of a Constituent Assembly.





[4]
Chief Land Committee was formed by the bourgeois Provisional
Government in April 1917. On it were the chiefs of the Ministry
of Agriculture and other officials appointed by the government,
representatives of gubernia land committees and political parties.
The Cadets and the S.R.s had an overwhelming majority on it.
Officially, it was the committee’s task to supervise the collection
and processing of material for a land reform. Actually, it was
designed mainly to fight the peasant movement for the take-over
of landed estates. In its declaration on the land question of May 
20 (June 2), 1917, it said that no one could solve the land question
until the convocation of a Constituent Assembly. After the
October Revolution, the committee fought against the implementation
of Lenin’s decree on land and was dissolved in December 1917
under a decision of the Council of People’s Commissars.

Comrade Kamenev

Entre nous: if they do me in, I ask you to publish my
notebook: “Marxism on the State ” (it got left behind in
Stockholm).[1] It’s bound in a blue cover. It contains a collection
of all the quotations from Marx and Engels, likewise from
Kautsky against Pannekoek. There are a number of remarks
and notes, and formulations. I think it could be published
after a week’s work. I believe it to be important, because
not only Plekhanov but also Kautsky have bungled things.
The condition: all this is absolutely entre nous!
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s work Marxism on the State was written in Zurich in
January and February 1917 and contains all the principal
statements by Marx and Engels on the state and the dictatorship of the
proletariat, extracts from books and articles by Kautsky,
Pannekoek and Bernstein, with remarks, additions, generalisations and
conclusions by Lenin.

When setting out from Switzerland to Russia in April 1917,
Lenin left it along with other material for safekeeping abroad.

After the events of July 1917, when Lenin was in hiding at
Razliv station, he asked that his notes be sent to him. He used
them to prepare his book The State and Revolution.

    MINUTES[1]
1


The question of the composition of Pravda’s editorial
board[2]
is under discussion. N. I. Bukharin suggests that he be released from
work in the Economic Conference, to enable him to devote himself
entirely to work in Pravda.


Comrade Lenin points out that up to now the Economic
Conference has not received sufficient attention, yet it is
one of the most important factors in current state
construction,[3] and therefore needs expert men, like Comrade
Bukharin. Therefore he insists that Comrade Bukharin should
not be on Pravda’s editorial board.
2


Yelena Stasova proposes an editorial board for Pravda composed
of the following three: J. V. Stalin, G. Y. Sokolnikov and N. I.
Bukharin.


Comrade Lenin proposes a different three: Sokolnikov,
Stalin and Trotsky.
3


An application from A. I. Rykov, L. B. Kamenev, V. P. Milyutin
and V. P. Nogin for readmission to the C.C. of the Party is under
discussion.


Comrade Lenin reads a rough draft of his reply to this
application,[4] pointing out that the statement of the four

    

shows clearly their complete disagreement with us, since
they consider that the C.C. has made concessions. He makes
the concrete proposal that the four should be required to
state in writing where they want their letter to go, i.e.,
whether they want it printed in the press. For our part we
do not intend to send it to the press, but reply to them in
writing that we are not taking them back.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
These speeches are published according to the minutes of the
C.C., R.S.D.L.P.(B.) for 1917, which are now at the Archives
of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U. Central
Committee. The minutes consist of short records of speeches by
participants in the meetings and of C.C. resolutions. Most of them
were taken down by Yelena Stasova. These secretarial notes were
not officially approved.





[2]
The question of Pravda’s Editorial Board was dealt with by the
C.C., R.S.D.L.P.(B.) in view of the fact that, as the minutes say,
“the best men have gone into government, Party work has
seriously suffered and this is especially noticeable in the Party organ,
which has altogether failed to satisfy readers, provide articles
explaining decrees, etc.” =

After a discussion the C.C. decided to
appoint a three-man editorial board consisting of Bukharin,
Stalin and Sokolnikov.





[3]
A reference to the establishment of the supreme economic body
of the Soviet state which it was planned initially to call “Supreme
Economic Conference”.





[4]
A reference to the treacherous behaviour of Kamenev, Rykov,
Milyutin and Nogin who abandoned their leading posts at the
most crucial period of the revolution, the emergence of the
Soviet power. By violating Party discipline they thwarted the will
and decisions of the Second Congress of Soviets, subverting the
newly gained dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasants.

On October 29 (November 11), 1917, the S.R.-Menshevik
Vikzhel (All-Russia Executive Committee of the Railwaymen’s
Union), a centre of anti-Soviet activity, passed a resolution on
the need to form a government from all “socialist” parties, and
the same day negotiations were started on the question between
it and the Bolshevik Central Committee. In its resolution the
C.C. pointed out that the conciliator parties conducted negotiations
with the aim of subverting the Soviet government, and that in
view of this the C.C. permitted the Bolsheviks’ delegates to take
part in the talks with the sole purpose of showing up the
unsolvency of the policy of setting up a coalition government and thus
putting an end to the talks, but Kamenev and Sokolnikov behaved
treacherously at these talks, accepting Vikzhel’s demand for a
“socialist” government which was to include representatives of
counter-revolutionary parties (S.R.s and Mensheviks), alongside
the Bolsheviks. This conciliatory policy was supported by
Nogin, Milyutin and Rykov.

On November 2 (15) the Bolshevik Central Committee adopted
Lenin’s resolution on the question of the opposition within the
Central Committee, urging all sceptics and waverers to cast off their
hesitation and support the Soviet Government (see present
edition, Vol. 26, pp. 277–79). On November 3 (16), the majority of
the Central Committee, on Lenin’s initiative, presented the
minority with an ultimatum (see present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 280–82),
demanding that they completely submit to the Central
Committee decisions and policy and stop their subversive and
disorganising activity; it declared that any attempt to force the Party to
give up power—handed to the Bolshevik Party by millions of
workers, soldiers and peasants at the All-Russia Congress of
Soviets—was betrayal of the proletarian cause. The minority
retaliated by announcing their resignation from responsible posts.
On November 4 (17) Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov and Milyutin
announced their resignation from the C.C. There is no record
of their application for a return to the C.C. or of Lenin’s draft
resolution in reply. The C.C. adopted Lenin’s reply as a basis, and
passed it on for editing to a three-man committee of C.C. members,
having resolved to publish it in the event the four men demanded
the publication of their letter. Their application was not
published.

                               1
SPEECH ON THE QUESTION OF SETTING UP
       A SUPREME ECONOMIC
COUNCIL[1]
NEWSPAPER REPORT

Lenin speaks in defence of the Soviet draft, pointing
out that the Supreme Economic Council cannot be reduced
to a parliament, but must be the same kind of fighting organ
for combating the capitalists and landowners in the economy
as the Council of People’s Commissars is in politics.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The question of setting up a Supreme Economic Council (S.E.C.)
was raised directly after the October Revolution. On October 
26 or 27 (November 8 or 9), 1917, a meeting of the Central Council
of the Petrograd factory committees in which Lenin took part
discussed the project for a governing economic body. In his speech

   

at an enlarged meeting of the Petrograd Trade Union Council
on November 9 (22), Lenin drew attention to the need to create
machinery for running the Soviet economy and said that
preparations for the establishment of such organisations were already
under way. The draft for the organisation of a supreme economic
body was worked out by a special commission set up by the
Council of People’s Commissars.

The Bolshevik group of the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee discussed the matter and stressed the need to make the
Supreme Economic Council a militant organ of the working-class
dictatorship by investing it with legislative powers. On
December 1 (14) the question was taken up by the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee. The Left S.R.s demanded an enlargement
of the S.E.C.’s peasant section and insisted that the Council
should be under the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
instead of the Council of People’s Commissars, as the draft proposed.
This was opposed by Lenin and the amendments were, voted down
by a majority. The decree on the Supreme Economic Council was
approved and published in Gazeta Vremennogo Rabochego i
Krestyanskogo Pravitelstva (Gazette of the Provisional Workers’
and Peasants’ Government) No. 25 on December 5 (18).

Lenin devoted much attention to organising the work of the
Supreme Economic Council, directed its activity and spoke at
congresses of economic councils. The question of organising its
activity was repeatedly discussed by the Council of People’s
Commissars. Thus, a government decision of December 23, 1917
(January 5, 1918) said that the S.E.C. must be transformed from
a discussion body into one actually directing industry. On
January 19 (February 1), 1918, the government discussed the question of
the S.E.C.’s activity and the need to eliminate duplication in
the work of the S.E.C. and economic commissariats and
departments, and adopted a circular binding the S.E.C. and all
commissariats to work in close contact with each other. The draft
circular had been amended and edited by Lenin (see Lenin Miscellany 
XXI, pp. 122–23).

When large-scale industry was fully nationalised, the S.E.C.
became its organ of management.

Comrade Shlyapnikov and Comrade Dzerzhinsky

The bearer, Comrade Vorobyov, a delegate from the Urals,
has excellent references from his local organisation. In the
Urals, there is a most acute problem. The boards of the
Urals works here (with offices in Petrograd) should be 
arrested immediately, threatened with (revolutionary) court
proceedings for bringing about a crisis in the Urals, while all
the works in the Urals should be confiscated. Draw up a
draft decree as soon as
possible.[1]

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
After the October Revolution the board of the Urals Mining
Societies stopped remitting money to the plants in retaliation to
the introduction of workers’ control over the enterprises, and
this led to an extremely difficult situation at the plants. The
workers had not been paid wages for several months and
were starving. The Urals Regional Soviet of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies sent one of its members, V. Vorobyov, to inform
the government in Petrograd of the slate of affairs in the Urals
and to settle the wages issue. Vorobyov gave all the details to
Y. M. Sverdlov, who took him to Lenin. When Vorobyov informed
Lenin of the state of the Urals industry and the mood of the
workers, Lenin gave him the note in question.

On December 23, 1917 (January 5, 1918) the Council of People’s

   

Commissars adopted a decision on the urgent remittance of 5 
million rubles to the Urals branch of the State Bank. The decision
was to have another 50 million remitted there by January 1 (14),
1918.

In January 1918, the Urals Regional Soviet of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies closed down the bureau of the Urals mining
industry conference, which was in Yekaterinburg (now
Sverdlovsk). In late December 1917 and early 1918, the most important
enterprises in the Urals were nationalised.

Written during a four-day vacation in Finland from December 
24 to 27, 1917 (January 6 to 9, 1918). The first topic for
elaboration, “Now there is no need to fear the man with the gun”, was
heard by Lenin in a car on the Finnish railway (see present
edition, Vol. 26, p. 463). It was also in Finland that Lenin wrote
his articles “Fear of the Collapse of the Old and the Fight for the
New”, “How to Organise Competition?” and “Draft Decree on
Consumers’ Communes” (see present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 400–03,
404–15, 416–17), which elaborated most of the subjects mentioned
here. Nearly all these subjects were most fully elaborated in his
article “The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government” (see
present edition, Vol. 27, pp. 235–77).

Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies No. 85, June 7
[20], 1917).





[9]
A reference to G. V. Plekhanov’s speech at the 16th sitting of the
Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. on the relative value of
democratic principles. He said all democratic principles should
be subordinated to the exclusive benefit of the revolution and the
working class. To ensure the success of the revolution, the
Social-Democrats could temporarily limit the operation of any of the
democratic principles. In the interests of the revolution, the
Social-Democrats could even come out against universal suffrage. “The
revolutionary proletariat could restrict the political rights of the
higher classes in much the same way the higher classes used to
restrict its political rights.” =

The revolutionary people could even
go to the extent of dispersing a bad parliament (see Protokoly 
II syezda RSDRP [Minutes of the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P.], Priboi Publishers, 1924, p. 156).

26, pp. 442–50) Lenin elaborated topics 20 and 20 bis; the
sentence “Die Deutschen brauchen eine Niederlage” is analysed in
Thesis 11.





[11]
The article “Their Plan”, which appeared in Pravda No. 223,
January 6, 1918 (December 24, 1917), said: “Lloyd George spoke
in the sense that Russia should first determine her future frontier
with Germany and Austria-Hungary, and then it will be
time for negotiation on a general peace.” =

Hence the conclusion
drawn in the article that the Allies were putting out feelers for
peace negotiations with Germany at the expense of the weak
nations.

PRELIMINARY THESES

The drafts put forward by the Commissariat for Food
for “supply boards”, “delegate committees”, etc., and
similarly the draft of the Supreme Economic Council for “
district economic
councils”[3] suggest the need to amalgamate
such bodies.

Preliminary theses:

(
Etwa[1]

):

[

supply and marketing committees?

]



The basic unit should be consumer and producer (better
than purchasing and trading, etc.) volost societies, playing
the part both of supply committees and marketing agencies.
In case of need, volost boundaries could be made alterable.

In the towns a similar place could perhaps be taken by
block committees or committees for sections of blocks.

If we manage to set up such committees, basic units,
in the localities, the amalgamation of these committees
would provide a network capable of properly organising
the supply of the whole population with all essentials,
and of organising production on a national scale.

Possibly instead of “societies” these could be Soviets
of Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, with the participation
of commercial employees, etc., etc.

Every such society or committee or Soviet (or supply
and marketing committee) would be divided up into
sections or departments, according to goods marketed and types
of products supplied, for the general regulation of production
and consumption (a department for finance, or for cash

    

receipts and disbursements, should be attached to every
supply and marketing committee). With the right of
levying income tax and granting interest-free credits to the
poor, and also universal labour service, this might be
the basic unit of socialist society. The volost banks would
then have to be amalgamated with the state savings banks,
being transformed into a state-wide accounting department,
aggregate of the state’s receipts and disbursements accounts.

The transportation of products, and likewise their
purchase and sale, would then be permitted only from one
supply and marketing committee to another, all individual
marketing being prohibited. On certificates issued by
volost (or generally the “basic”, lowest) supply and
marketing committees, products could be sold also to individuals
from central stores, provided that these transactions are
recorded in the books of the volost or other supply and
marketing committees (except within small units, or for
trifles). No transportation of products would be permitted
without certificates from the supply and marketing
committee.


[[BOX:

This would be the unification of the Commissariats
for Agriculture, Trade and Industry, Labour, and Food,
and the Supreme Economic Council, and the
Commissariats for Finance and Communications.

]]




|| 
N.B.: “Supply and marketing committees”: volost,
uyezd, gubernia and district. (σσ=the S.E.C.) Their
departments: Central Textile Board, Central Sugar Board,
Central Coal Board, etc. (σσ=the S.E.C ), Central Bank,
etc.


[

N.B.: Representatives of the Soviets of Workers’,
Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies should superintend the
well-to-do quarters in towns (or well-to-do
country-house settlements, etc.), i.e., those quarters, etc., where
the percentage of workers and peasants is lower than,
say, 60 per cent.

]

[2]
Draft Decree on Consumers’ Communes was written by Lenin
on December 25–28, 1917 (January 7–10, 1918), and published in
part in Sobraniye Sochineny (Collected Works) of V. I. Lenin,
Fourth Edition (see present edition, Vol. 26, pp. 416–17). It was
fiercely opposed by bourgeois co-operators. The Soviet
government believed that the bourgeois apparatus of accounting and
control should be utilised, and made some concessions to the
co-operators. Negotiations with them were conducted in March
and early April 1918. At first, the co-operators insisted on complete
independence of co-operative societies from the organs of the
Soviet power and on servicing their own members only. The draft
decree worked out in late March was adopted by the Council of
People’s Commissars on April 10, with Lenin making a number
of amendments in the draft. Clauses 11, 12 and 13 were fully
written by Lenin.

The decree was approved by the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee on April 11, 1918, and the following resolution of the
Bolshevik group was adopted: “Consumers’ co-operatives, which
cater for a sizable section of the population, have until now been
pursuing an economic policy which frequently ran counter to, or
outside, the economic policy conducted by the Soviet
government. This was due to the fact that the leadership of consumers’
co-operative societies was chiefly in the hands of the
non-labouring classes. At present, with the consolidation of the Soviet
power, consumers’ co-operatives have expressed their readiness
to work under the direct guidance and control of Soviet organs of
power. The decree on consumers’ co-operatives, worked out on
the basis of negotiations between the central co-operative
organisations and the Council of People’s Commissars, is a compromise
solution with essential shortcomings. But, considering the
organisation of the proper distribution of food and goods among
the population to be one of the most important and urgent tasks
of the present period, whose solution requires a number of socialist
measures in this sphere and the substitution of a state trade
apparatus for the private commercial apparatus, the Central

__PRINTERS_P_689_COMMENT__
44—39

   

Executive Committee adopts the decree on consumers’ co-operatives
as a transitional measure leading to the implementation of state
distribution of food and goods in the country” =

(Protokoly
zasedany VTsIK 4-go sozyva [Minutes of the Fourth All-Russia Central
Executive Committee], Moscow, 1920, p. 104). The decree was
published over the signature of the Chairman of the Council
of People’s Commissars, Vl. I. Ulyanov (Lenin), in Pravda
No. 71, April 13 (March 31), 1918, and Izvestia No. 75, April 16
(April 3), 1918.





[3]
A reference to the directive issued by the People’s Commissariat
for Food to local Soviets on organising a food supply apparatus,
its draft for a Commissariat for Supply, and the statute of the
Supreme Economic Council on district economic councils.

Because the old food supply agencies sabotaged the decrees
of the Soviet government, the People’s Commissariat for Food
issued a directive to local Soviets on December 22, 1917 (
January 4, 1918) that they should rely on the delegate organisations
from the consuming gubernias and armies (delegates’ committees),
set up under the food supply agencies, take over the food supply
effort and organise their own food supply apparatus. At the same
time, the People’s Commissariat for Food was working out a draft
for its reorganisation into a Commissariat for Supply, which was
to take charge of supplying the population not only with
foodstuffs but other goods as well, sharply curtailing private trade in
the process. The local agencies of the Commissariat for Supply
were to be turned into supply departments under the Soviets.

On December 23, 1917 (January 5, 1918), the Supreme
Economic Council adopted the Statute of District (Regional) and Local
Economic Councils, which were to organise and regulate local
production under the guidance of the S.E.C.

Antonov, at His Staff. Kharkov

I welcome whole-heartedly your energetic activity and
ruthless struggle against the Kaledinites. I entirely approve
of your refusal to make concessions to the local conciliators,
who, it seems, have led astray a section of the Bolsheviks.
I particularly approve of and welcome the arrest of the
millionaire saboteurs in the first– and second-class railway
carriage.[1] I advise you to send them for six months to do forced
labour in the mines. Once again I greet you for your
resolution, and condemn the waverers.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In response to the introduction of the 8-hour working day,
Kharkov capitalists stopped paying wages to workers in time. The
workers appealed to V. A. Antonov-Ovseyenko for help. When
the local revolutionary committee, to which the latter applied,
failed to take steps, he summoned 15 of the major capitalists to
his railway car and ordered them to find 1 million rubles in cash
to pay the workers. Following their refusal, they were detained
and placed under arrest in a second-class carriage. They were
told that unless they got the money in time, they would be sent
to work in the mines. This had an effect, the money was collected
and paid in, and the capitalists were released.

 MINUTES
1

Comrade Lenin speaks first and points out that at the
meeting on January 8 (21) three standpoints were brought
out on this question, and asks whether the question should
be discussed point by point on the theses he put forward,
or whether a general discussion should be opened. The
second alternative is adopted, and Comrade Lenin has the
floor.

He begins by setting forth the three standpoints brought
out at the previous meeting
(1) signing a separate
annexationist peace,
(2) waging a revolutionary war, and
(3)
proclaiming the war ended, demobilising the army, but not
signing a peace treaty. At the previous meeting, the first
standpoint received 15 votes, the second 32 and the third 16.

Comrade Lenin points out that the Bolsheviks have
never renounced defence, but this defence and protection
of the fatherland must have a definite, concrete context,
which exists at the present time, namely, defence of the
Socialist Republic against an extremely strong international
imperialism. The question is only one of how we should
defend our fatherland, the Socialist Republic. The army
is excessively fatigued by the war; the horses are in such
a state that in the event of an offensive we shall not be
able to move the artillery; the Germans are holding such
favourable positions on the islands in the Baltic that if
they start an offensive they could take Reval and Petrograd

    

with their bare hands. By continuing the war in such
conditions, we shall greatly strengthen German imperialism,
peace will have to be concluded just the same, but then the
peace will be still worse because it is not we who will be
concluding it. The peace we are now forced to conclude is
undoubtedly an ignominious one, but if war begins, our
government will be swept away and peace will be concluded
by a different government. At present, we are relying not
only on the proletariat but also on the poor peasantry, which
will abandon us if the war continues. Drawing out the war
is in the interest of French, British and American
imperialism, and proof of this, for example, is the offer made at
Krylenko’s headquarters by the Americans to pay 100 rubles
for every Russian soldier. Those who take the standpoint
of revolutionary war stress that we shall then be engaged
in a civil war with German imperialism, and shall thereby
awaken revolution in Germany. But Germany, after all,
is still only pregnant with revolution, whereas we have
already given birth to a quite healthy infant, the Socialist
Republic, which we may kill if we start the war. We are
in possession of a circular letter of the German
Social-Democrats, there is information about the attitude to us of
two trends in the Centre, of which one considers that we have
been bought, and that the current events in Brest are a farce,
with the actors playing out their parts. This section is
attacking us for the armistice. The other section of the
Kautskyites says that the personal honesty of the leaders of the
Bolsheviks is beyond all doubt, but that the Bolsheviks’
behaviour is a psychological
riddle.[1] We don’t know
the opinion of the Left-wing Social-Democrats. The
British workers are supporting our efforts for peace. Of
course, the peace we conclude will be an ignominious one,
but we need a breathing space in order to carry out social
reforms (take transport alone); we need to consolidate
ourselves, and this takes time. We need to complete the
crushing of the bourgeoisie, but for this we need to have both our
hands free. Once we have done this, we shall free both our
hands, and then we should be able to carry on a
revolutionary war against international imperialism. The echelons
of the revolutionary volunteer army which have now been
formed are the officers of our future army.
 

What Comrade Trotsky is proposing—an end to the war,
refusal to sign a peace treaty and demobilisation of the
army—is an international political demonstration. The only
thing we achieve by withdrawing our troops is handing
over the Estonian Socialist Republic to the Germans. It
is said that by concluding peace we are giving a free hand
to the Japanese and Americans, who will immediately
occupy Vladivostok. By the time they have even reached
Irkutsk, we shall have been able to strengthen our Socialist
Republic. By signing a peace treaty we of course betray
self-determined Poland, but we retain the Estonian
Socialist Republic and win a chance to consolidate our gains.
Of course, we make a turn to the right, which leads through
a very dirty stable, but we must do it. If the Germans start
an offensive, we shall be forced to sign any peace treaty, and
then, of course, it will be worse. An indemnity of three
thousand million is riot too high a price for saving the
Socialist Republic. By signing peace now, we give the broad
masses a visual demonstration that the imperialists (of
Germany, Britain and France), having taken Riga and
Baghdad, are continuing to fight, whereas we are
developing, the Socialist Republic is developing.
2

Comrade Lenin points out that he is not in agreement
on some points with his supporters Stalin and
Zinoviev.[2]
Of course, there is a mass movement in the West, but the
revolution there has not yet begun. But if we were to alter
our tactics because of that, we should be traitors to
international socialism. He does not agree with Zinoviev that
the conclusion of peace will for a time weaken the
movement in the West. If we believe that the German movement
can develop immediately, in the event of an interruption
of the peace negotiations, then we must sacrifice ourselves,
for the German revolution will have a force much greater
than ours. But the whole point is that the movement there
has not yet begun, but over here it already has a newborn
and loudly shouting infant, and unless we now say clearly
that we agree to peace, we shall perish. It is important for

    

us to hold out until the general socialist revolution gets
under way, but this we can only achieve by concluding
peace.
3

Comrade Lenin motions a vote on the proposition that
we drag out the signing of a peace treaty in every possible
way.

A reference to the following words of J. V. Stalin as entered in
the minutes: “Comrade Stalin believes that in adopting the

   

slogan of a revolutionary war we play into the hands of imperialism.
Comrade Trotsky’s stand is not a stand. There is no revolutionary
movement in the West—no facts of it—only a potential, and
that is something we cannot reckon on. If the Germans start
an offensive this will strengthen the counter-revolution over
here.”

Lenin’s reference to G. Y. Zinoviev’s speech applies to the
following words: “Of course, we are faced with a serious surgical
operation, because if we conclude a peace we shall strengthen
chauvinism in Germany and for a time weaken the movement all
over the West. Beyond that is another prospect—the collapse
of the socialist republic” =

Notes
 
 



[1]
Central Rada—a bourgeois nationalist organisation set up at a
congress of Ukrainian bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties and
groups in Kiev in April 1917. Its chairman was M. Grushevsky,
and his deputy, V. Vinnichenko. Among its members were
Petlyura, Yefremov and other nationalists. After the Great October
Socialist Revolution, the Rada proclaimed itself the supreme
organ of the “Ukrainian People’s Republic” and took the path of
open struggle against the Soviet power. Some states tried to set
up a centre in the Ukraine pivoted on the Rada for fighting against
the proletarian revolution. France gave the Rada a loan of 200
million francs. The Rada helped the Don and Kuban whiteguard
generals in their fight against the Soviet power, and tried to disarm
Soviet regiments and the Red Guard in the Ukraine. A manifesto
to the Ukrainian people from the Council of People’s Commissars,
written by V. I. Lenin on December 3 (16), 1917, exposed the
Rada’s counter-revolutionary anti-Soviet activity (see present
edition, Vol. 26, pp. 361–63). In December 1917 and January 1918
armed uprisings against the counter-revolutionary Rada swept
the Ukraine, restoring Soviet organs of power. In January 1918,
Soviet troops in the Ukraine started an offensive and on January 
26 (February 8) took Kiev and overthrew the rule of the bourgeois
Rada.

People’s Commissar Antonov, Kharkov

In view of complaints by the People’s Secretariat of
friction which has arisen between you and the Central
Executive Committee of the
Ukraine,[1] I request you to inform
me of your side of the matter. Naturally our interference
in the internal affairs of the Ukraine, unless required by
military necessity, is undesirable. It is more proper to
have the various measures adopted through the local
authorities, and in general it is best to settle all
misunderstandings on the spot.

Lenin
 

Notes

The telegram was sent to V. A. Antonov-Ovseyenko in connection
with the complaint lodged against him with Lenin by the
Ukrainian Central Executive Committee of Soviets. Antonov-Ovseyenko
had appointed commissars from his staff to the railway stations
and several towns of the Donets Basin, without agreeing this
with the local organs, which had aroused the dissatisfaction
of the Ukrainian authorities.

Antonov-Ovseyenko took steps to eliminate the friction upon
receipt of the telegram and letter from Lenin (see p. 474) and
recalled his commissars.

January 21, 1918

Comrade Antonov,

I have received a complaint against you from the Central
Executive Committee (at Kharkov). I very much regret
that my request to you to come to an understanding did not
reach you. Please, contact me as soon as you can (by direct
line, single or double, through Kharkov) so that we can
talk the thing out and get a really good understanding
between ourselves. It is my earnest request that you make
every effort to eliminate all friction with the (Kharkov)
C.E.C. This is of the utmost importance to the state. I beg
you to make peace with them, and recognise their
sovereignty in every possible form. I earnestly ask you to recall the
commissars you have appointed.

I very much hope that you will fulfil this request, and
reach absolute peace with the Kharkov C.E.C. This calls
for super-tact on a national plane.

As regards the victories over Kaledin and Co., I send
you warmest greetings, good wishes and congratulations.
Hurrah and hurrah! I warmly shake your hand.

Yours,
 Lenin

Comrade Lenin believes that the agenda of the Congress
should consist of the Party Programme, the question of
peace, and tactical questions.
2


N. I. Bukharin, Y. M. Sverdlov and J. V. Stalin table concrete
proposals for the agenda of the Party’s Seventh Congress.


Comrade Lenin agrees with all the previous speakers,
but he is worried by the vast number of October Bolsheviks
in the Party, a fact which may hinder the Congress in
working out a consistent programme.
3

Comrade Lenin considers it essential that in admitting
members a mandatory inscription be made concerning the
date of joining the Party: before Oct. 25 or after; and that
it is essential that new members recognise the mandatory
nature of the tactics which the Party found correct in
relation to the October Revolution.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Central Committee meeting on January 24 (February 6),
1918 dealt with one question, namely, the agenda of the Seventh
Party Congress. On the basis of the proposals submitted, the
Central Committee approved the following agenda for the Congress: =

1)
review of the programme; =

2) current situation (internal
situation, external situation, economic situation); =

3) trade unions,
factory committees, etc.; =

4) organisational question; =

5)
miscellaneous. A commission headed by Lenin was set up to work out
the Party’s programme (see Protokoly TsK RSDRP. Avgust
1917-fevral 1918 [Minutes of the Central Committee of the
R.S.D.L.P., August 1917–February 1918], Moscow-Leningrad, 1929,
pp. 223–25).

When speaking of the October Bolsheviks Lenin had in mind
those members of the Party who joined-it after the October
Socialist Revolution. The Central Committee decided that only
those members who had been in the Party for more than three
months, that is, those who had joined it before the Revolution,
were entitled to voice and vote at the Congress. In opening the
Seventh Congress Y. M. Sverdlov, who was in the chair, announced
the C.C. decision that “the Congress is to be deemed competent
only if more than one-half the delegates of the preceding, Sixth
Congress of the Party are present” =

(see Protokoly syezdov i
konferentsy VKP(b). Sedmoi syezd [Minutes of Congresses and
Conferences of the R.C.P.(B.). Seventh Congress], 1928, p. 1).

We cannot postpone discussion of the question, because
if the Germans do not accept our offers of peace, we carry
on a revolutionary war.
2

There is one point for achieving united tactics. If the
offensive becomes a fact, then we sign peace. It is possible
that the Germans have done a deal with the French, and
this is a question not of Poland but of overthrowing the
Soviet Government.

Indefinite tactics now are out of place. We have to act.
If the Germans carry on a war by agreement with the French,
then we carry on a revolutionary war. We have to
demonstrate this clearly to the people. That is why we need either
an armistice or a peace. We may muddle people’s
understanding. We shall be unable to hold the masses. There is no reply
to the radio message. Everyone will have to fight. It will
be a different grouping. To drag on means to obscure the
understanding of the masses. They are losing their land.
We shall have concluded peace with the people, not with
imperialism.
3

We must send out information all over Russia to
prepare.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In view of the German offensive against the Soviet Republic, the
Central Committee met twice on February 18, 1918. At the
morning sitting, after an exchange of opinion one question was put
to the vote at Lenin’s insistence. He called for an immediate
proposal to the Germans to resume the peace negotiations. A
majority of seven to six voted it down. The Central Committee was to
have met at 2.00 p.m. the following day, but when news came
that the Germans had taken Dvinsk (Daugavpils) the Central

   

Committee met the same night, and Lenin reiterated his proposal
with the utmost vigour. The Central Committee decided to inform
the German Government on behalf of the Council of People’s
Commissars that the Soviet Government was prepared to conclude
peace. The initial draft of the radiogram was written by Lenin
on the spot and sent to Berlin the same night on behalf of the
Council of People’s Commissars (see present edition, Vol. 26,
p. 525).

Lenin’s statements are taken from the secretarial record of the
C.C. minutes. His statements in a different version are given in
Vol. 26 of the present edition, pp. 520–21.

Comrade Lenin believes that the policy of revolutionary
phrases is at an end. If this policy is continued, he will
resign both from the government and from the Central
Committee. An army is needed for a revolutionary war,
and it does not exist. That means the terms must be
accepted.
2

Comrade Lenin. Some have reproached me for coming
out with an ultimatum. I put it as a last resort. It is a
mockery for our Central Committee members to talk
of an international civil war. There is a civil war
in Russia, but not in Germany. Our agitation remains.
We are agitating not by words, but by the revolution.
That too remains. Stalin is wrong when he says that we
need not sign. These terms must be signed. If you don’t
sign them, you will sign the Soviet power’s death warrant
within three weeks. These terms do not infringe on the
Soviet power. I have not the slightest hesitation. I put
the ultimatum not in order to withdraw it. I don’t want
revolutionary phrases. The German revolution has not yet
matured. This will take months. The terms must be
accepted. If there is another ultimatum later, it will be in a new
situation.
    

       3

Comrade Lenin. I also consider it essential to prepare
for a revolutionary war. The treaty can be interpreted,
and we shall interpret it. The demobilisation there is in
a purely military sense. Before the war, we also had an
army. A revolutionary war needs serious preparation. I
do not doubt for a second that the masses stand for peace.
4

Lenin proposes the following for voting:
(1) Are the
German proposals to be accepted immediately?
(2) Is a
revolutionary war to be prepared for immediately?
(3) Is
a poll of Soviet electors in Petrograd and Moscow to be
taken immediately?
5


Comrade Lomov asks whether Vladimir Ilyich allows of silent
or open agitation against signing the peace.


Comrade Lenin replies in the affirmative.
6


In view of the statement by several members of the C.C. that they
are resigning all their responsible Soviet and Party posts, Y. M.
Sverdlov proposes that members of the C.C. remain at their posts until
the Congress, and carry on their agitation within the Party.


Comrade Lenin is in favour of discussing the question
raised by Sverdlov as, first, there are three days to go
before the signing and, second, twelve days for ratification.
Consequently, it will be possible to canvass the Party and,
if it comes out against signing, ratification will not follow;
but as time is short today, he suggests postponing the
question until tomorrow.
    

       7


Comrade Stalin asks whether resignation from their posts does
not in effect mean withdrawal from the Party.


Comrade Lenin points out that resignation from the C.C.
does not mean withdrawal from the Party.
8

Comrade Lenin suggests that the comrades should leave
the sessions during the voting and should not sign any
documents, so as not to bear any responsibility, but should
not give up their work in the Council.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The meeting of the Party’s Central Committee on February 23,
1918, was called in connection with the even harsher peace terms
which the Germans presented, and the demand that they be
examined within 48 hours. The Left Communists Bukharin, Uritsky,
and Lomov (Oppokov) once again objected to Lenin’s peremptory
demand that the German terms be accepted and peace signed
at once. Trotsky opposed the signing of the peace and declared
that in view of his disagreement with Lenin’s stand he was
resigning from the post of People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs.
Sverdlov, Zinoviev and Sokolnikov favoured signing the peace.
In his first speech, Stalin proposed that the peace talks should
be resumed and added that “peace does not have to be signed”.
Following Lenin’s criticism of his stand, he spoke out in favour
of signing the peace at once. Lenin, Stasova, Zinoviev, Sverdlov,
Stalin, Sokolnikov and Smilga voted for the immediate signing
of the peace; Bubnov, Uritsky, Bukharin and Lomov (Oppokov)
voted against, and Trotsky, Krestinsky, Dzerzhinsky and Joffe
abstained. After the vote, the group of Left Communists—Bukharin,
Lomov, Bubnov, Pyatakov, Yakovleva and Uritsky—announced
that they were resigning from their responsible Party and
government posts, reserving the right to conduct agitation inside
and outside the Party.

Antonov, Rostov-on-Don, wherever he may be 

Our warmest greetings to all the dedicated fighters for
socialism, and greetings to the revolutionary Cossacks.
In reply to your telegram from
Novocherkassk[1] we inform
you: let a plenipotentiary congress of urban and rural
Soviets of the whole Don Region work out its own draft land
law, and submit it to the Council of People’s Commissars
for endorsement. That will be better. I have nothing against
the autonomy of the Don Region. The geographical
boundaries of this autonomous region must be fixed by agreement
with the population of the neighbouring zone and the
autonomous republic of the Donets Basin. We cannot send you
a delegate, everyone here has his hands full. We ask you
to represent the Council of People’s Commissars, or to
appoint someone at your discretion.

Lenin, Stalin

The telegram from V. A. Antonov-Ovseyenko of February 26,
1918, stating the content of his talks with a delegation of the Little
Army Council of the Don forces, which raised the question of
autonomy for the Don region with the right of independently solving
the land question.

weak and backward). Peace and war in their
interconnection.

15. We are waiting, while retreating, for a different
ally: the international socialist proletariat.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Fourth (Extraordinary) All-Russia Congress of Soviets was held
in Moscow from March 14 to 16, 1918. It was called to decide on
the ratification of the Brest Peace Treaty. On the eve of the
Congress, on March 13, the Bolshevik group of the Congress met to
hear Lenin’s report on the treaty (see Lenin Miscellany XI,
Second Edition, 1931, pp. 68–70). A preliminary vote in the group
yielded the following results: 453 votes for Lenin’s motion to
ratify the Brest Treaty; 36, against; 8, abstained.

On March 14, Lenin gave his report on the ratification of the
peace treaty at the Congress. B. Kamkov, on behalf of the Left

   

S.R.s, was the rapporteur against ratification. By a roll call vote
the Congress passed Lenin’s resolution (see present edition,
Vol. 27, pp. 200–01): 784, in favour; 261, against; 115, abstained,
including the Left Communists who read out a special declaration
on the motives of their abstention.





[2]
A reference to the example Lenin gave in his summing-up speech
at the Seventh Congress: “... two men are walking together and
are attacked by ten men, one fights and the other runs away—
that is treachery; but suppose we have two armies of a hundred
thousand each and there are five armies against them; one
army is surrounded by two hundred thousand and the other
must go to its aid; knowing that the other three hundred
thousand of the enemy are in ambush, should the second army go to
the aid of the first? It should not” =

(see present edition, Vol. 27,
p. 114).

Treaty at a meeting of the Communist group of the Fourth (
Extraordinary) All-Russia Congress of Soviets on March 13, 1918.

You can rest assured, comrades, that the Council of
People’s Commissars will support autonomy for your
territory on Soviet principles; we welcome your initiatives,
and are deeply convinced that you will cover the whole
territory with a network of Soviets, and will act in close
contact with the Soviets already in existence.

We ask you to send the commission for the calling of
a Constituent Congress of Soviets, which you have
undertaken to organise, to us here in Moscow, in order to work
out together the question of defining the relations between
the plenipotentiary organ of your territory and the Council
of People’s Commissars.

In greeting your Congress, we hope that you will be
equal to the tasks imposed on it by history.

Moscow, April 22, 1918

on its agenda was the question of autonomy for the territory.
The Congress adopted a decision to set up a commission for the
convocation of a constituent congress of Soviets of the Turkestan
Territory to define the frontiers and the sphere of competence of
Turkestan’s autonomy.

June 14, 1918

Comrade Zinoviev,

Every effort must be made to send hundreds of agitators
to the countryside from Petrograd immediately. This is
particularly important now, on the eve of the Congress
of
Soviets,[1] and the whole military and food situation
demands it even more insistently. We shall find the money,
don’t spare the cost. We have talked about this in detail
with Svidersky (and Tsyurupa). Concentrate on this.

Greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the forthcoming Fifth All-Russia Congress of Soviets,
which opened in Moscow on July 4, 1918. Y. M. Sverdlov reported
on the activity of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee,
and Lenin, on the work of the Council of People’s Commissars.
On these reports the Congress adopted a resolution motioned by
the Communist group, expressing “complete approval of the
foreign and domestic policy of the Soviet Government”. It rejected
a resolution motioned by the Left S.R.s voicing no confidence
in the Soviet Government and proposing to scrap the Brest Peace
Treaty and to change the Soviet Government’s foreign and
domestic policies. The Congress adjourned in view of the
counter-revolutionary revolt started by the Left S.R.s in Moscow on July
6 and re-assembled on July 9. Having heard the government’s
report on the events of July 6 and 7, the Congress fully approved
its resolute action in stamping out the criminal venture of the
Left S.R.s.

The Congress discussed the reports on the food question and
the organisation of the Red Army, and concluded its work by

   

adopting the first Constitution of the R.S.F.S.R. which gave
legislative form to the gains of the Soviet working people.

Commissar Ivanov, Voronezh

The Left S.R. revolt and Muravyov’s betrayal have
been completely liquidated. Strong aid to the Czechoslovak
front is
needed.[1] All efforts on the Kuban front should
be concentrated on full and reliable protection of the line
from Tikhoretskaya to Tsaritsyn and from Tsaritsyn to
the north, not on further
advance.[2] Mekhonoshin,
Kobozev and Blagonravov are temporarily in command on the
Czechoslovak front.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference is to the mutiny of the Czechoslovak corps, which was
formed in Russia before the October Revolution from among
Czechs and Slovaks who had been taken prisoner as soldiers of
the Austro-Hungarian army. Under an agreement of March 26,
1918, the Soviet Government allowed the corps to leave Russia
via Vladivostok, provided the corps handed in its arms and
removed Russian officers from its command posts. But in late May,
on instructions from, and with the support of, the imperialists
of the U.S.A., Britain and France, the counter-revolutionary
command of the corps provoked mutiny against the Soviet power.
They operated in close contact with the whiteguards and the
kulaks and occupied a considerable part of the Urals, the Volga
area, and Siberia, everywhere restoring the power of the
bourgeoisie. Whiteguard governments, with the participation of the
Mensheviks and S.R.s, were set up in the areas occupied by the corps.

Many soldiers of the corps came to realise that they had been
duped by their counter-revolutionary command and went over to
the side of the Red Army, refusing to fight against Soviet Russia.
About 12,000 Czechs and Slovaks fought in the ranks of the Red
Army.

In the autumn of 1918 the Volga area was liberated by the Red
Army; the whiteguard Czechs were routed in 1919 simultaneously
with the rout of Kolchak.





[2]
Lenin’s directive was to block the advance of the whiteguard
army towards Tsaritsyn. In mid-July, Tikhoretskaya railway
station was taken by the whiteguards, but their further advance
was halted by the Red Army, which had swiftly re-formed and
organised, on Lenin’s instructions, reliable protection of the
road to Tsaritsyn.

[1]
A reference to the report of the chairman of the Penza Gubernia
Party Committee, Yevgenia Bosch, on the state of affairs in the
gubernia.

On August 5, 1918, a kulak revolt broke out in Kuchkino
Volost, of Penza Uyezd, and soon spread to neighbouring volosts.
By means of deceit and coercion, the kulaks managed to recruit
many middle and even poor peasants. It was stamped out in Penza
Uyezd on August 8, but the situation in the gubernia remained
tense. A Left S.R. revolt started in the uyezd centre of Chembar
on the night of August 18. The Penza leaders did not take
sufficiently vigorous action to suppress the counter-revolutionary revolts.
Lenin sent several telegrams to Penza demanding resolute measures
in fighting the kulaks.

A reference to the Board for the Issue of State Papers which
printed banknotes and stamps. It was evacuated from Petrograd to

Secret

Kedrov, Gubernia Executive Committee, Vologda

The harmfulness of your departure has been shown by
the absence of any leader when the British began their
advance up the Dvina.

Now you must intensively make up for lost ground,
contact Kotlas, send aviators there immediately and organise
the defence of Kotlas at all
costs.[1]

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

M. S. Kedrov’s departure for Moscow coincided with the start
of the offensive by the Entente interventionist troops in the
direction of Vologda and Kotlas.

Lenin proposed that the defence of Kotlas should be organised
at all costs, because there were large stocks of explosives there,
and accordingly sent a demolition group to prepare their blast
off at the critical moment. Lenin ordered the commander of the
Moscow district, N. I. Muralov, to find the heavy artillery battery
sent from Moscow to the Urals and place it at the disposal of
M. S. Kedrov.

The Red Army held Kotlas—and its war stocks—and this was
of great importance for the outcome of the civil war in the North.

Please give your assistance to the bearer, Comrade
Malyshev, who is organising supplies of explosives for the
group going to Kotlas. The matter is supremely urgent.

It is necessary that explosives should be got without
loss of time from Vyazma (Malyshev will leave for Vyazma
this very day, with a warrant from you).

You must also send a telegram to Kursk summoning
Comrade Sobolev, a demolition instructor.

The demolition group require one carriage (fast) to

That all Commissariats be instructed to draw up within
one week a brief report, from two to live printed pages,
on their work from Oct. 25, 1917.

That these reports be drawn up in the most popular
language, with special attention to facts on the role of
workers’ organisations and representatives of the
proletariat in government, to large-scale measures of a socialist
nature and the struggle to break the resistance of the
bourgeoisie.

That the same instruction be given to the All-Russia
Extraordinary Commission.

That the Presidium of the Central Executive Committee
be requested to take the same decision as regards its
activity (with special emphasis on the Constitution and the
results of the congresses of Soviets).

To all frontier Soviets

According to the latest information, German soldiers
have arrested a delegation of German generals on their way
to negotiate an armistice. German soldiers have entered
into direct negotiations with French soldiers. Kaiser
Wilhelm has abdicated. Chancellor Prince of Baden has
resigned. The new Chancellor is to be the government
Social-Democrat Ebert. General strike has swept all major cities
of Southern Germany. The whole German navy is on the
side of the revolution. All German ports in the North Sea
and the Baltic are in the hands of the revolutionary navy.
We have received from the Kiel Council of Soldiers’
Deputies a radio message, addressed to the international
proletariat, to the effect that the German navy is flying the
red flag and that funeral services for those who fell for
liberty are to be held today. All this will very probably
be concealed from the German soldiers on the Eastern Front
and in the Ukraine. By all the means at your disposal bring
these facts to the knowledge of the German soldiers.

I became acquainted with Comrade Proshyan and learned
to value his co-operation during our work together in
the Council of People’s Commissars, at the end of last
year and the beginning of the present year, when the Left
S.R.s were in alliance with us. Proshyan stood out for
his deep devotion to the revolution and to socialism. It
could not be said of all the Left S.R.s that they were
socialists, and this could even hardly be said of most of them.
But this had to be said about Proshyan, because, in spite
of his loyalty to the ideology of the Russian Narodniks,
a non-socialist ideology, you saw in Proshyan a deeply
convinced socialist. In his own way, not through Marxism,
not starting with the idea of the class struggle of the
proletariat, did this man become a socialist; and I was able
to observe more than once, when working together with
him in the Council of People’s Commissars, how Comrade
Proshyan would resolutely side with the Bolsheviks, the
Communists, against his fellow Left Socialist–
Revolutionaries, when they expressed the standpoint of the petty
proprietors and took a negative attitude to communist measures
in the sphere of agriculture.

I particularly recall a conversation with Comrade
Proshyan not long before the Brest peace. It seemed then that
there no longer remained any substantial differences
between us. Proshyan began speaking to me about the need
for our parties to amalgamate, saying that the Left S.R.s
most remote from communism (at that time, the word
was not yet commonly used) had noticeably, and very
strongly, drawn closer to it during the period of our work
together in the Council of People’s Commissars. I was reserved

    

as regards Proshyan’s proposal, and called it premature,
but did not at all deny that we had come closer in our
practical work.

The Brest peace brought about a complete divergence,
and from divergence, given Proshyan’s revolutionary
consistency and convictions, there could not but develop direct,
even armed struggle. I must admit I did not in any way
expect matters to go as far as an insurrection, or such facts
as the betrayal of Commander-in-Chief Muravyov, a Left
S.R. But the example of Proshyan revealed how deep the
roots of patriotism were even in the most sincere and
convinced socialists from among the Left S.R.s, how differences
in the general principles underlying men’s world views
had inevitably shown themselves at a difficult
turning-point in history. The subjectivism of the Narodniks led
to a fatal error on the part of even the best of them, who
let themselves be blinded by the spectre of monstrous
strength, that of German imperialism. Any other struggle
against that imperialism except an insurrectionary one,
and moreover immediately, that very minute, without any
consideration of the objective conditions of the
international situation and our own, seemed in the light of a
revolutionary’s duty absolutely intolerable. It was the effect
of the very same mistake which in 1907 made the
Socialist-Revolutionaries unconditionally “boycott” the Stolypin
Duma. But in the circumstances of hot revolutionary
battles the error took a more cruel revenge, and pushed
Proshyan on to the path of armed struggle against the Soviet
power.

Nevertheless up to July 1918 Proshyan succeeded in
doing more to strengthen the Soviet power than he did
after July 1918 to undermine it. And in the international
situation created after the German revolution, a new
approach by Proshyan to communism—a firmer one than
before—would have been inevitable but for his untimely
death.

Immediately arrest Kogan, a member of the Kursk
Central Purchasing Board, for refusing to help 120 starving
workers from Moscow and sending them away
empty-handed. This to be published in the newspapers and by leaflet,
so that all employees of the central purchasing boards and

Izvestia of February 2 carried a letter from a peasant,
G. Gulov, who asks a question about the attitude of our
Workers’ and Peasants’ Government to the middle
peasantry, and tells of rumours that Lenin and Trotsky are
not getting on together, and that there are big differences
between them on this very question of the middle peasant.

Comrade Trotsky has already replied to that in his “
Letter to the Middle Peasants”, which appeared in Izvestia
of February 7. In this letter Comrade Trotsky says that
the rumours of differences between him and myself are the
most monstrous and shameless lie, spread by the
landowners and capitalists, or by their witting and unwitting
accomplices. For my part, I entirely confirm Comrade
Trotsky’s statement. There are no differences between us, and
as regards the middle peasants there are no differences
either between Trotsky and myself, or in general in the
Communist Party, of which we are both members.

In his letter Comrade Trotsky has explained clearly and
in detail why the Communist Party and present
Workers’ and Peasants’ Government, elected by the Soviets and
belonging to that Party, do not consider the middle
peasants to be their enemies. I fully subscribe to what Comrade
Trotsky has
said.[2]

There is not a single decree (law) or decision of the
Soviet government which fails to draw a distinction between
the three main groups of peasants. The first group is the
poor peasants (proletarians and semi-proletarians, as they
are usually called in economic science). They are very
numerous. When the landowners and capitalists were in
power, the brunt of their yoke fell on the poor peasants.
In all the countries of the world, the workers and the rural,
poor supporting them are the firmest basis for the true

    

socialist movement. The second group is the kulaks, that
is, the rich peasants who exploit the labour of others, either
hiring them for work, or lending money at interest, and
so forth. This group supports the landowners and
capitalists, the enemies of the Soviet power. The third group is
the middle peasants. They are not enemies of the Soviet
power. They can be its friends; we are working for this,
and will bring it about. All the teachers of socialism have
always recognised that the workers will have to overthrow
the landowners and the capitalists in order to build
socialism, but that with the middle peasants an agreement is
possible and essential.

Under the landowners and capitalists, only very few of
the middle peasants, perhaps one in a hundred, managed to
secure a stable welfare, and then only by becoming kulaks,
and saddling the poor peasants, whereas the vast majority
of the middle peasants inevitably must suffer from poverty
and ill-treatment by the rich. That is the case in all
capitalist countries.

Under socialism, all workers and all middle peasants to
a man can have full and stable welfare, without robbing
someone else’s labour. No Bolshevik, no Communist, no
intelligent socialist has ever entertained the idea of
violence against the middle peasants. All socialists have
always spoken of agreement with them and of their gradual
and voluntary transition to socialism.

Our country has been ruined more than other countries by
the criminal four-year war of the capitalists. Everywhere
there is ruin and dislocation, lack of goods for sale, and
a terrible and tormenting famine in the towns and
nonagricultural gubernias. We have to strain every effort to
overcome the breakdown, to overcome the famine, to
overcome the troops of the landowners and capitalists, who are
trying to restore to power the tsar and the rich, the
exploiters. In the South, on the Don and in the Ukraine, the
white-guards have been beaten, and the road to fuel (coal) and
grain is being opened up. A few final efforts, and we shall
be saved from the famine. But the destruction left behind
by the war is great, and only long and self-sacrificing work
by all toiling people can bring our country out on to the
road to sustained prosperity.
 

Two kinds of complaints must be noted among those
being voiced by middle peasants. First, there are complaints
at the excessively “bossy”, undemocratic, and sometimes
absolutely disgraceful behaviour of the local authorities,
especially in the backwoods. Surely it is more difficult
to organise proper control and supervision of the local
authorities’ work in the countryside, and the worst elements
and dishonest people sometimes worm their way into the ranks
of the Communists. Those who, contrary to the laws of
the Soviet power, treat the peasants unjustly must be
ruthlessly fought, immediately removed and most severely
prosecuted. All the efforts of honest workers and peasants
are being directed to purging Russia of these “relics” of
the landowners’ and capitalists’ system who allow
themselves to behave like “bosses” when, under the laws of
our Workers’ and Peasants’ Republic, they should behave
like men elected by the Soviets and set an example of
conscientiousness and strict observance of the laws. The Soviet
power has already shot quite a few such officials caught,
for example, taking bribes, and the struggle against such
scoundrels will be carried on to the end.

Another kind of complaint is made against the
requisitioning of grain and the strict prohibition of free sale of
grain. Our government is fighting inexorably against
arbitrary action and breaches of the law. But can we allow
free sale of grain? In our ruined country, there is not enough,
or barely enough, grain, and in addition the railways
have been so spoiled by the war that supplies are going
very badly.

When there is not enough grain, the free sale of it means
terrific profiteering and inflation of prices up to hundreds
of rubles per pood, because a hungry man will give
anything for a piece of bread. The free sale of grain in a hungry
country means frenzied profiteering by the kulaks, the
shameless rich peasants who fill their money-bags out of
the people’s need and the hunger. The free sale of grain in
a hungry country means a victory of the rich over the poor,
because the rich will buy grain even at a mad, fantastic
price, while the poor will have nothing. The free sale of
grain is freedom for the rich to make profits, and freedom
for the poor to die. The free sale of grain means a return

    

to the domination and unbridled power of the
capitalists.

No. We don’t want to go back, and will not go back,
to the restoration of the rule of the capitalists, the rule
of money, and freedom to profiteer. We want to go forward
to socialism, to the proper distribution of grain among
all the working people. All grain surpluses must be handed
over to the Soviet state at a fair price; and the state must
distribute them equally among the working people. This
cannot be achieved all at once, it is not easy to establish
such a fair socialist system. It will take a great deal of
work and effort, and strict comradely discipline among
the workers and peasants, to root out the old, capitalist,
freedom to trade, freedom to make profits, freedom to fight,
freedom to oppress—a freedom that has covered the whole
world with blood.

But this difficult work has now been taken up by
millions and millions of workers and peasants. Every honest
peasant and worker has realised the importance of
socialism, and is persistently fighting for it.

The socialist revolution is growing-throughout the world.
The power of the capitalists, “freedom to trade”, will not
return. Socialism will win.

N. Lenin

February 14, 1919
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The letter of G. Gulov, a Red Army man of peasant stock, was
published in Izvestia No. 24, February 2, 1919. Gulov quoted his
talks with middle peasants and said that they were still “not
clear about the status of the middle peasant and the attitude of
the Communist Party to him”. =

He asked Lenin to explain to
Communists “who the middle peasant was and what assistance
he would be able to render our socialist government, given the right
approach to him”. =

For a detailed explanation of the Party’s
attitude to the middle peasantry, see Lenin’s report on work in
the countryside, which he gave at the Eighth Congress of the
R.C.P.(B.) on March 23, 1919, and the resolution of the Congress
on the attitude to the middle peasants (see present edition,
Vol. 29, pp. 198–215 and 217–20).





[2]
After the October Revolution, Trotsky for a time formally
accepted the Party’s policy on the peasant question, and he follows this
line in his letter to middle peasants, which Lenin mentions. In
saying that, he had no differences with Trotsky on current policy
in the peasant question, Lenin did not touch upon his differences
with Trotsky on the basic, principled problems of the socialist
revolution and socialist construction in connection with Trotsky’s
“theory of permanent revolution”, which was fundamentally
erroneous and politically harmful. While Lenin and the Party
worked on the premise that, given a correct policy in respect of the
middle peasants, and a sound alliance between the working class
and the peasantry, socialist society could be built in Russia,
Trotsky denied the possibility of socialism winning out in one
country, and spoke, of an inevitable clash between the proletariat
and the peasantry. In 1923, in his theses for the Twelfth Congress
of the R.C.P.(B.), Trotsky put forward the slogan of a “
dictatorship of industry”, which meant the development of industry
through the exploitation of the peasantry. This policy would
have broken up the alliance of the working class and the

   

peasantry and ruined the Soviet system. In subsequent years, Trotsky
openly opposed Lenin’s plan for the construction of socialism
in the Soviet Union and the Party’s policy and openly waged
a counter-revolutionary struggle against the Soviet power. The
Communist Party routed Trotskyism and other defeatist trends,
secured a sound alliance between the proletariat and the
peasantry and brought the Soviet people to the victory of socialism.

Notes
 
 



[1]
The notes may have been written by Lenin at a sitting of the
Council of People’s Commissars on March 8, 1919, during the
discussion of the question of reorganising state control. Lenin’s
directions, briefly stated in these notes, were taken as the basis
for the C.P.C. decision of March 8, 1919, on the reorganisation
of state control. It stressed the need to amend the draft decree by
adding the following points:

“a) Systematic participation of workers’ organisations; =

b)
systematic participation of witnesses from among proletarian
elements; =

c) inspection raids and other revolutionary measures
to eliminate red tape; =

d) exact delimitation of rights and duties
in respect of other Commissariats; =

e) strict demarcation of
inspection and control functions from auditing functions which are to
remain with the Commissariats Concerned. ”

The revised decree with Lenin’s amendments was approved
by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on April 2, 1919,
and published in Izvestia No. 79, April 12, 1919 (see Sobraniye
Uzakoneny i Rasporyazheny Raboche-Krestyanskogo Pravitelstva
[Collection of Laws and Decrees of the Workers’ and Peasants’
Government] No. 12, April 24, 1919).

Bourgeois democracy confined itself to proclaiming
formal rights equally applicable to all citizens, e.g., the right
of assembly, of association, of the press. At best all
legislative restrictions on these points were abolished in the
most democratic bourgeois republics. But, in reality, both
administrative practices and particularly the economic
bondage of the working people always made it impossible
for them, under bourgeois democracy, to make any wide
use of these rights and liberties.

By contrast, proletarian or Soviet democracy, instead
of the formal proclamation of rights and liberties,
guarantees them in practice first and foremost to those classes
of the population who were oppressed by capitalism, i.e.,
the proletariat and the peasantry. For this purpose, the
Soviet power expropriates from the bourgeoisie premises,
printing presses and stocks of paper, and places them at
the entire disposal of the working people and their
organisations.

The task of the Russian Communist Party is to draw
ever wider masses of working people into the exercise of
their democratic rights and liberties, and to extend the
material possibilities for this.

April 30, 1919

Comrade Zinoviev,

Talking with Comrade Yemelyanov, I was particularly
struck by the fact that such best and most reliable
Petrograd workers are wasting themselves on technical work
like road transport.

This is unforgivable! For technical work we can hire and
take ninth-rate men and strangers, i.e., those whose honesty
is not known. But men like Yemelyanov should be sent
into the countryside, into the administration, into
management, into the uyezd executive committees, where honest
men are few and far between, where the need for honest
men is desperate.

Could we form a sponsoring group of workers in Petrograd,
consisting of Comrade Yemelyanov and 5 or 10 of his
friends, to select 300–600 Petrograd workers, with the most
solid references from the Party and the trade unions, for
dispatch, singly or in pairs, to uyezd executive committees
throughout Russia?

I should support this plan in every possible way. All
such men (too old to go to the front) should be taken off
technical work and posts where they can be replaced, and
transferred to administrative work in the countryside.
Without a group of such absolutely reliable and experienced
Petrograd workers we shall not be able to bring about any
big improvement in the villages.

Greetings,
 Lenin

Rakovsky, Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
   Kiev, for Kamenev

Absolutely essential that you personally, taking along
Joffe, if necessary, to help you, should not only verify
and expedite but personally bring up the reinforcements
to Lugansk and the Donets Basin generally, as otherwise
the disaster will undoubtedly be tremendous and scarcely
remediable. If you need one, take a mandate from the Kiev
Council of Defence. We shall undoubtedly perish unless
we clear the Donets Basin completely in a short time.
Provisionally, until Rostov has been taken, we must be
diplomatic with Makhno’s troops, sending Antonov there in
person, and making him personally responsible for
Makhno’s troops. Telegraph detailed reply.

Lenin
 

Notes

L. B. Kamenev was then the representative of the Council of
Defence at the Southern Front. Lenin sent the telegram to him in
connection with the news that Lugansk had been taken by the
whiteguards on May 4, 1919.

Bela Kun, Budapest

Received your letter of April 22 only on May 13. I am
sure that in spite of the vast difficulties the proletarians
of Hungary will retain power and consolidate it. Greetings
to the growing Red Army of the Hungarian workers and
peasants. The Entente’s ferocious peace will everywhere
strengthen sympathy with the Soviet power. Yesterday
the Ukrainian forces defeated the Rumanians and crossed
the Dniester. I send best greetings to you and to all
Hungarian comrades.

General cancellation of mobilisation of workers of the
Donets Basin, with the present situation at the front, is
absolutely
impermissible.[1] The Council of Defence realises
the exceptional importance of the Donets Basin, and
has therefore decided to defer mobilisation for hewers only,
even in those enterprises which for one reason or another
are not producing coal at the present time. Retaining the
hewers, at any rate, safeguards the coal industry against
disaster, and will permit the resumption of coal-getting
directly the emergency is over. No other deferments are
permissible.

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of Defence
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In view of the worsening of the position of the Red Army forces
on the Southern Front, the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.)
decided in early May 1919 to mobilise at least 20,000 workers
in the Ukraine to strengthen the armies on the Southern Front.
The C.C. directive of May 9, 1919 said: “The figure of 20,000
is to be taken as a minimum, and a fortnight as the maximum
to save our position on the Southern Front. The work must be
conducted with exceptional energy. Cable at once about all measures
you take. Every three days cable the C.C. on the results achieved. ”

On May 16, 1919, the Kharkov Chief Coal Board asked Lenin
that all miners be exempted from the draft. In reply, Lenin sent
the telegram in question the same day.

A note written by Lenin in connection with the following fact.
The Office of the Executive Secretary of the Council of People’s
Commissars received complaints from peasants F. Romanov (
Yaroslavl Gubernia) and I. Kalinin (Moscow Gubernia) that the local

   

authorities had wrongfully confiscated horses. The complaints
were sent to a special commission dealing with such cases and
were returned to the Council of People’s Commissars with the
remark, “Too busy to deal with such trifles”, which so outraged
Lenin.

Coded

Bela Kun, Budapest

We have had a special discussion at the Central
Committee of the Party, as a separate item on the agenda, of
the question you raised about sending you the comrade
you named. We found it impossible to send him, and have
sent another who has already left, and is being delayed only
for technical reasons; he should soon reach you.

By the way, let me add for myself that you are, of
course, right in beginning negotiations with the Entente.
They should be begun and carried on; it is necessary to
make the fullest possible use of every opportunity to
obtain a temporary armistice or peace, in order to give the
people a breathing space. But do not trust the Entente
powers for a moment. They are deceiving you, and are
only attempting to gain time in order to be able to crush
you and us.

Try and organise postal communications with us by
air.

Best regards,
 Lenin

Comrade Chicherin, please have this translated and sent
to Bela Kun.

Lenin

Examples.
Flying quite low. Examples.
So as to issue

Comrade Zinoviev has sent me this article, with the
request that I send it on to the Moscow press. I fulfil his
request with great pleasure. The article, in my opinion,
deserves to be reprinted in all the newspapers. All Party
comrades ought to read it, and should everywhere,
following the example of Petrograd, start simultaneously both
purging the Party of “hangers-on” and intensively
recruiting to the Party all the best elements among the mass of
workers and peasants.

The whiteguard offensive is clearly a manoeuvre to reduce
our pressure in the South. Beat off the enemy, strike at
Yamburg and Gdov. Mobilise office staff for the front. Close
down nine-tenths of the departments. Mobilisation of all
our forces for the front has never yet been carried out
anywhere, although much has been written about it, and there
are circular letters and a resolution of the Central
Committee.[1] You must drive them off in time so as to resume
your help to the South.

had translated a revolutionary poem by E. Carpenter, which was
published in Pravda No. 250, November 7, 1919. M. I. Ulyanova
was then Secretary of the Pravda Editorial Board. When
Okhrimenko came to collect his remuneration, he told her of his plight.
She heard him with great attention and asked him to call again
the next day. When he did, she handed him this note from Lenin.
Soon he was provided with all the things he needed.

Kursky[1]

In my opinion, this should be added:

1) drawing up a protocol is not as yet a “complaint”,
but only an exact record of the beginning of the dispute.
The best way to avoid a complaint is to secure an exact
reply or immediate performance;

2) by this means we can and should secure rapid
decisions ire substance, without red tape, namely: by proposing
a short method of solution on the spot, proposing it
officially (“collect the material in such-and-such a place,
I suggest that an order be placed at such-and-such an
office, I request that such-and-such be done to avoid
bureaucratic delay”); such a statement or request will greatly
assist the centre in combating red tape;

3) against the Council of People’s Commissars and the
Council of
Defence[2] to go to the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee;

4) after endorsement by the C.P.C., publish an article
(with examples; chew it up) in Bednota.

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written on the following occasion: on December 13, 1919,
telegram No. 927 was sent by the Central Board of State Associations
of Machine-Building Plants to the Council of Defence asking
that the Kulebaki and Vyksa factories should be supplied with
fodder in connection with their work on defence orders. They
said that their exercise of the right of procuring fodder on their
own had been futile because of red tape in the Commissariat for
Food and the unfriendly attitude and arbitrary action on the part
of local gubernia food committees.

Having examined the request on December 17, 1919, the
Council of Defence 1) adopted a decision on measures to assure the said
factories of fodder and 2) instructed D. I. Kursky to draft an
additional circular concerning the undeviating fulfilment of the laws
passed by the Sixth Congress of Soviets with a popular
explanation which Kursky was to submit for the next sitting of the Council
of People’s Commissars. His draft submitted to the Council on
December 23 already included all of Lenin’s additions proposed
in his note to Kursky.

On December 23, 1919, the draft was examined by the Council
of People’s Commissars, which decided: to circulate the draft
to the commissars for their opinion and, in the absence of
objections, to submit it to Lenin for signature. The decree was signed

   

on December 30, 1919 (see Sobraniye Uzakoneny... No. 1–2 for
1920).





[2]
Council of Defence (Council of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defence)
was formed under a decision of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee on November 30, 1918, to direct the defence of
the Soviet Republic. The decision set before the Council the task
of implementing the All-Russia C.E.C. decree of September 2,
1918, which declared the Soviet Republic a military camp, and
instituting a military regime in transport and food supply, and
also in the war industry. It was vested with full powers in
mobilising men and resources for defence. The Council directed the
supply of the front with reinforcements, arms, food and clothes.

Lenin was at the head of the Council, on which were
representatives of the All-Russia C.E.C., the Revolutionary Military
Council of the Republic, the Extraordinary Commission for
Supplies, the People’s Commissariat for Communications, the People’s
Commissariat for Food, and the All-Russia Central Council of
Trade Unions.

In early April 1920, following the elimination of the main
fronts, the Council of Defence was transformed into the Council
of Labour and Defence, and on December 29, 1920, with the Civil
War over, the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets turned it
into a commission of the Council of People’s Commissars, in which
capacity it operated until the end of 1937.

 INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN EDITION

With the greatest interest and with never slackening
attention I read John Reed’s book, Ten Days That Shook
the World. Unreservedly do I recommend it to the workers
of the world. Here is a book which I should like to see
published in millions of copies and translated into all languages.
It gives a truthful and most vivid exposition of the events
so significant to the comprehension of what really is the
Proletarian Revolution and the Dictatorship of the
Proletariat. These problems are widely discussed, but before
one can accept or reject these ideas, he must understand
the full significance of his decision. John Reed’s book will
undoubtedly help to clear this question, which is the
fundamental problem of the international labor movement.

MINUTES

Comrades,

Comrade Lozovsky said that Comrade Bukharin and I
will be partly in agreement with him. That is true. You
have written the theses, but what are you defending? Then
you must strike out your theses, because they say: “as a
basic principle”, but we do not take practice as our point
of departure. So write that down, then. What in that case
remains of your theses? Today I had occasion to be at a
meeting of the water transport workers, and to argue there,
and Comrade Ishchenko said: “In any case, there is a
guarantee that we shall put the question as practical men.”
All right then, put that down; but what you have written is
something different. You have written: “as a basic
principle”. Where is your justification, who is defending it?
No one. They edge away. Write that down, and then half
our differences will disappear. And after all, what you
have written is untrue: where do you answer the argument
which is put forward, against collective management; where
is the participation of the broad masses, with three, five
or seven workers taking part in the collegiums? Do you
want participation by the broad masses or don’t you? Of
course, those who don’t want it are to be thrown out, but
that is no argument. You say, the “broad non-Party masses
of workers”. There are no such masses in a single

    

collegium: it’s not true, and that’s no way to reason. That
is not the system you need to draw in the broad non-Party
masses: you have to train, to promote, to enliven. How
many workers have the Central Committee of the textile
workers and others put forward? How many of them have
been promoted and how many demoted during the last
three months? Give me figures, and then I will say: there
are the people. It’s childish to write “principles”: after
studying it for two years, all you have written are
principles—people will laugh. Here your argument does not
correspond to your conclusion: participation of the broad
masses is assured by a collegium of seven, or of three,
persons. People will laugh at it. That is my first objection.

Secondly, I refer you to the bourgeoisie. Whom shall
we learn from, if not the bourgeoisie? How did they
manage? They managed as a class when it was the ruler, but
didn’t it appoint managers? We haven’t yet caught up
with them in their degree of development. They knew how
to rule as a class, and to manage through anyone you please
individually, entirely in their own interests; at the top
they had a small collegium and they didn’t discuss basic
principles and didn’t write such resolutions. They had
all power in their hands, and regarded as competent the
one who knew his job. The workers have not yet reached
that point, and in order to win we must give up our old
prejudices. The rule of the working class is reflected in
the constitution, the ownership and in the fact that it is
we who are running things, while management is quite
another matter, it is a question of skill, a question of
experience. The bourgeoisie understood this perfectly, but
we have not yet realised it. Let’s get down to learning.
We have already said here that we must hold power firmly
in our hands, but we haven’t yet learned how to manage;
we have to do a great deal to learn the business of
management.

My third argument: competence. How can you show
that it is possible to manage without being competent, to
manage without full knowledge, without knowledge of the
science of management? It is ridiculous! What sort of
system is it? Why all the words that you have spoken here?
In order to manage, one must know the job and be a

    

splendid administrator. Where does it say that for this reason
we need collective management? The fact that we have
few experienced workers proves the contrary; what follows
is that collective management is intolerable. In that case,
adopt theses in which you say: keep a commissar or a
commission, etc., attached to every expert. So long as we lack
the principle of competence and respect for the expert,
we remain at the primitive level. In that way we shall
never create any industrial front. Unity of will! Without
this there is no dictatorship at the front, but dawdling.
You know it is a typical result, that there is friction there,
not management. Appoint an expert with experience; but
we know by now that when we combine a competent person
with an incompetent one in a collegium, we create a
multitude of wills and complete confusion. That is my fifth
argument.[1]

Everyone is writing resolutions about each
person being answerable for his own job. But where is this being
carried out? Let them say: where did we divide
responsibility according to that principle? We have been learning for two
years how to run the state, and still write: “the basic
principle.” This is ridiculous, this is on the second-form level;
but let’s have your experience, and we shall see from
it to what extent you are competent people and where the
lack of competence tells. They say that under the
artillery department the works managements were poor. That
is the example Lozovsky and Tomsky have quoted. When
was this? Comrade Lozovsky, we have to reckon with the
condition of the Soviet Republic. What did we begin with,
who was at the head? Krylenko, Dybenko and Podvoisky,
before we had Trotsky—and that was our collective
management. And if Kolchak and Denikin lambasted us, why
did they? Because while we had seven men in charge, we
had to learn for two years, and after that we went over
to one-man management. Do we have to reckon with this,
or not? Of course, it’s only a trifle, you’ve just taken the
two years’ history of the Republic and crossed it out. Why?
You don’t like it, do you? Do it all over again. And what
about Rykov: he was appointed Extraordinary

    

Plenipotentiary for Soviet Defence, and Rykov began dragging things
out of the mess by himself. You don’t know your own
history, the history of your Supreme Economic Council and
of the Soviet Republic. History tells us that from collective
management by the workers we went over to management by
tens, we broke our necks, and Kolchak lambasted us, and
it was a good thing he did, because we learned something
thereby, we learned that collective management must be
held in a tight grip. We have described four systems:
accept these four
systems,[4] accept the C.C. theses. Then
you will be taking your stand on the groundwork of the two
years’ history of the Soviet power, of its experience, and
not on arguments which are primitive, which will muddle
you ...[2]

for an adult worker, who is not afraid of any
expert and says, “if you put experienced people in charge,
our machinery will run”. That is how an adult workman
reasons, while the timid ones say: “I’m afraid that I shall
be left without an expert.” That is a sign of weakness.
Stop whining, and be your age.
 

Notes
 

[1]
Evidently there was a fourth argument against collective
management, but it did not find reflection in the minutes.—Ed.

[2]
Passage not clear.—Ed.
 



[3]
The meeting of the Communist group of the All-Russia Central
Council of Trade Unions was called on March 15, 1920, to discuss
the theses of M. P. Tomsky on the tasks of the trade unions,
published in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn (Economic Life) No. 54, March 10,
1920. They had been discussed beforehand by a commission set
up by the group, but it had retained all the principled
propositions of the theses. The author held that industrial enterprises
should be run on collective lines and said so in his theses. This was
supported by the majority of the group. At the meeting of the
group, Lenin spoke several times, making amendments and
criticising various points of the theses, and supporting the principle
of one-man management.





[4]
In view of the fact that no generally accepted type of management
for Soviet enterprises had crystallised, various combinations
were allowed while the process was on, namely: =

1) the enterprise
is headed by an executive from among the workers, who has a
specialist engineer for an assistant; =

2) the enterprise is headed by
a specialist engineer, who is the actual manager of the
enterprise, and he has a worker commissar with broad powers and the

   

duty to deal with every aspect of the business; =

3) the enterprise
is headed by a specialist director, with one or two Communist
assistants with powers and the duty to look into every branch
of management but without the right to rescind the director’s
instructions; and =

4) the enterprise is headed by a small well-knit
group whose chairman is responsible for the work of the group
as a whole. This form of organisation in industry was adopted by
the Ninth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) (see KPSS v resolyutsiyakh...,
Part One, 1954, p. 483).

Have the German delegates signed a paper that we have

Entirely supporting this statement, and the radio
message of March 16, 1920, sent by Comrade Milyutin, I
request that instructions be given that any delegation from
foreign workers coming to Russia should, without fail,
sign a statement that the content of these radio messages
and my present postscript for the information of the workers
abroad has been brought to their knowledge. The foreign
workers must know the truth, that in settling here they
are accepting privation.

May 6, 1920

Lenin
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
In connection with the mass applications by German workers,
technicians and engineers to settle in Soviet Russia and work
there, the Soviet Government broadcast an announcement on
March 16, 1920, that special delegations should be sent put to
find out about living conditions for the settlers. In an additional
broadcast on May 6, 1920, it once again stressed the need to
make a study beforehand of the economic conditions of life in
Soviet Russia, since foreign workers who settled in Russia would
receive no more wages than Russian workers.

Copies of these broadcasts with a note by Lenin were sent by
deputy chairman of the Supreme Economic Council Milyutin to
the People’s Commissariat for Labour, the People’s Commissariat
for Foreign Affairs, the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade
and members of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council
as a brief for negotiations. Contracts were valid only when the
pledge specified by Lenin was signed.

However, because the talks conducted by these agencies on
the resettlement of German workers were slow, Lenin had to write
another note to Milyutin (see p. 524).

11.30 p.m. June 4

Comrade Botin,

When you called on me today I had only two minutes,
because I had to go back to an important meeting.

Now I have a quarter of an hour free, and therefore can
(and must) tell you in more detail and more clearly that
mistakes have obviously been made, and that you should
frankly, honestly and resolutely repudiate these mistakes.
Otherwise a most important undertaking will be ruined.

The mistake was, firstly, that there was distrust of the
“expert”, which prevented his being told everything at
once and speedy organisation of the experiment; secondly,
that the “spade” or preparatory work was done by you
personally, which distracted you from the real work, when
the whole mass of the “spade”, i.e., preparatory, work
must be passed on to the mechanics, assembly-men,
electricians, etc., of whom we can find a dozen. And to separate
your real work from the preparatory or auxiliary jobs,
the constant advice of an “expert” is necessary.

Now you have promised me to have full trust in the “
expert”, and I believe that you have been entirely convinced
of his Party attitude and his absolute loyalty to the
revolution. So I must ask you to fulfil your promise to me in
its entirety (otherwise the mistakes will be inevitably 
repeated). Tomorrow morning, therefore, show everything to
the “expert” and tell him how matters stand (while your
assistants are bringing up the cars and doing the preparatory
work). Then, together with the “expert”, the experiments
will be carried through without further delays.

Please reply to me that you promise to do this.

Best wishes,
 Lenin
 

Notes

A reference to the experiments of S. I. Botin, who was working
on the problem of distance controlled blasts with the aid of
electro-magnetic waves. Lenin realised the great importance of this in
conditions of the Civil War and foreign intervention, and devoted
much attention to and concern for the inventor.

The “expert” in this case is A. M. Nikolayev, a member
of the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Posts and
Telegraph in 1918–24, and chairman of the Radio Council. In the
summer of 1920, Nikolayev was seconded, on Lenin’s assignment,
to work with S. I. Botin as a specialist and attorney for the
inventor’s secrets.

A vast amount of material, particularly on the foreign
policy of the Entente, is published every week in our
newspapers and in foreign ones (not only communist, but also
bourgeois papers of various countries).

This material (see also the Bulletin of the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs) is lost for international
communist agitation; yet it is extremely valuable.

I suggest that a committee be set up to summarise this
material and publish monthly booklets.

The content: the facts of the foreign policy of the
Entente (plunder; wars; insurrections; financial strangulation).

The number of copies: as small as possible, since the
main aim is translation into other languages.

A subcommittee of a few professors should (under strict
control) collect all that is valuable, particularly from the
bourgeois newspapers (which best of all expose their “
rivals”).

A committee of Party comrades will read the professors’
manuscripts to correct them, and make the professors do
that.

Newspapers get lost; booklets will remain, and will help
the foreign comrades.

Your opinion, please.

The main principle of administration, in the spirit of
all the decisions of the R.C.P. and the central Soviet
institutions, is the following:

—a definite person is fully responsible for some specified
work.

I have been doing something (for such-and-such a time),
and I am responsible for it. I am hindered by X, who is
not the responsible person, who is not in charge.

This means squabbling. This means chaos. This means
interference by a person unsuitable for responsible work.
I demand his removal.

A. I. Yelizarova tells the following: “This was in the autumn
of 1920. Since that January, my department, under a decision of
the Council of People’s Commissars, had been transferred from the
People’s Commissariat for Social Security to the People’s
Commissariat for Education. I hesitated to move with it at once: I

   

was afraid that I would not be able to work with the People’s
Commissariat for Education—because of the differences on some
points—especially after the sudden appointment as my deputy
of a total stranger from the Commissariat for Education in place
of one of my associates. Vladimir Ilyich suggested that I give
it a try, and if things didn’t work out and I failed to establish
a working arrangement with this person, then I could make an
effort to get another deputy. In fact things did not work out....” =

She informed Lenin of this and he handed her the note at a sitting
of the Council of People’s Commissars (A. I. Yelizarova, “A Page
from Reminiscences about Vladimir Ilyich in the Council of
People’s Commissars”. =

Comrade M. N. Pokrovsky

Comrade M. N.,

I congratulate you very much on your success. I was
extremely pleased with your new book, Russian History in
Brief Outline. The presentation and approach are original.
It reads with tremendous interest. I think it ought to
be translated into the European languages.

Let me make a small remark. To turn it into a textbook
(and it should become one), it needs to be supplemented
with a chronological index. This is what I mean: do it
approximately in this way
(1) a column of dates;
(2) a column
of bourgeois assessments (briefly);
(3) a column of your,
Marxist assessment, with references to the pages of your
book.

Pupils should know both your book and the index, so
that there should be no superficiality, so that they should
know the facts, so that they should learn to compare the
old science and the new. What’s your opinion about this
supplement?

December 5

With communist greetings,
 Yours,
 Lenin

NOTES ON THESES BY NADEZHDA KONSTANTINOVNA[3]

(Private. Rough draft. Not to be made public.
    I will think this over once again.)

That is not the way to write about polytechnical
education: it sounds abstract, for the remote future; current,
present-day, deplorable reality is not taken into account.

It is necessary 

(1) to add one or two theses about the importance of
polytechnical education in principle

{{

according to Marx

according to our R.C.P. Programme

}}



(2) to say clearly that on no account can we renounce
the principle and the putting into effect immediately, so
far as is possible, of education specifically on polytechnical
lines.

17th thesis out.

On secondary education (12–17) to say:

The Republic’s extremely difficult economic situation
requires at the present time, unquestionably and
immediately, 

the
fusion[1]

of secondary schools and technical schools, 

transformation[2]

of secondary schools into technical schools, 
but at the same time, to avoid transformation into
trade schools, the following exact rules should be laid down:

1) Early specialisation to be avoided; an instruction
to be worked out on this.

2) General educational subjects to be enlarged in all
technical schools.
 

Annual programmes to be drawn up:

(If there are no
such programmes
yet, Lunacharsky
to be hanged)

{{

Communism
History in general
” of revolutions
” of the 1917
revolution

Geography
Literature
etc.

}}



(3) A binding task to be the immediate transition to
polytechnical education or, more accurately, immediate
realisation of a number of steps to polytechnical education,
feasible at present, such as:

[[ BOX: Jointly with Goelro ]]
 


a) visit to a power station, the nearest
one, and a number of lectures with
experiments there; a number of practical
jobs, any that are possible with
electricity; work out at once detailed programmes
(for 1 visit; for a course of 5, 10 lectures;
of 1, 2 months, etc.);

b) the same to every decently organised
state farm;

c) the same to every decently organised
works;

[[ BOX: Jointly with Goelro ]]


d) mobilisation (for lectures on electricity
and polytechnical education, taking charge
of the practical work, excursions, etc.)
of all engineers, agronomists, all
graduates from university physics and
mathematics faculties;

e) organisation of small museums on
polytechnical education, mobile exhibitions
on trains, steamers, etc.

This is of supreme importance. We are beggars. We need
joiners, fitters immediately. Unquestionably. All must
become joiners, fitters, etc., but with such-and-such an
addition of general educational and polytechnical minimum
knowledge.

The task of the secondary school (more accurately:
of the upper classes of the secondary school, 12–17 age group)
is to turn out
 a joiner,
 a carpenter,
 a turner, and so forth, 
 

who knows his job thoroughly, who is fully capable of
becoming a skilled man and has been trained for this in
practice, but with this addition, however, that this “
craftsman” 

should have a broad general education (should have a
minimum grounding in such-and-such sciences: which
exactly to be indicated);

should be a Communist (indicate exactly what he should
know);

should have a polytechnical outlook and the foundations
(beginnings) of polytechnical education,
 (Grinko has
evidently overdone it

namely:

(aa) fundamental conceptions of electricity
 (define precisely which), 

to the point of
stupidity, 
rejecting polytechnical
education [
maybe, partly, 0. Y.
Schmidt
too).[4] This to be
corrected.)

(bb) the application of electricity to the
engineering industry,

(cc) ditto the chemical industry,

(dd) basic idea of the plan for
electrification of the R.S.F.S.R.

(ee) a visit to a power station, a works, a
state farm not less than 1–3 times, 

(ff) such-and-such foundations of
agricultural science, etc. The minimum of
knowledge to be worked out in detail.

Written on N. K. Krupskaya’s theses, “On Polytechnical
Education”, which she drew up for a report at a Party conference on
public education called by the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.)
directly after the Eighth Congress of Soviets on December 31,
1920. The task of the conference was to prepare material on “
organising education in the Republic” for the Tenth Congress of the
R.C.P.(B.). Lenin kept in touch with the work of the conference,
which was to hear N. K. Krupskaya’s report on polytechnical
education, but she did not give it because she fell ill.





[4]
G. F. Grinko—People’s Commissar for Education in the Ukraine,
who put forward his own scheme for public education. It was
based on two principles: =

1) for children under 15 there was to be a
“single system of social education, with all organisational forms
(nursery schools, children’s homes, seven-year schools, etc.) on
labour lines, =

__NOTE_594_COMMENT__ Missing ” for 1)

and 2) after the age of 15 there was to be “special
training in some sphere of production or organisational group
(industrial, agricultural, economic, etc.)”.

This scheme clashed with the programme of the R.C.P.(B.)
in the sphere of public education: =

1) Free and universal general,
polytechnical education (giving an idea of the theory and practice
of all the main branches of production) for children of both sexes
until the age of 17.... =

8) Broad network of occupational education
for persons from the age of 17 linked up with polytechnical
knowledge” (ee KPSS v resolyutsiyakh..., Part One, 1954, pp. 419–20).

O. Y. Schmidt, who was then deputy chairman of the Chief
Administration for Vocational Training, favoured, like
Grinko, technical vocational training for young people “at an earlier
age ... that is, from 15 ”. He argued that the “interests of production,
the interests of economic development imperatively demanded

   

a reduction of the so-called general educational, and actually
the purely verbal, school and a transition to concrete, special
instruction as early as possible”. =

Schmidt tried to turn a
makeshift measure, caused by the difficulties of the transition period,
into a principle, and wrote articles in the press arguing in favour
of monotechnical instead of polytechnical education, that is,
training in some branch of production. For a criticism of these views,
see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 123–25.

NOTES FOR A SPEECH ON THE SUBSTITUTION
OF FOOD REQUISITIONING BY A TAX

1. General political significance of this
question: =the question of peasant (
petty-bourgeois) counter-revolution.

Such counter-revolution is already
facing us.

in the press
smooth out
“inter-relations
between the
proletariat and the
peasantry ”
 smooth out in
the press



2. Theoretical excursion
 (α) bourgeois or socialist revolution?
 The struggle will decide. 

(β) The Renegade Kautsky (p. 102,
1918
edition[2])....

3. Who will overcome whom? 2 different classes.
 The lesson of
“Kronstadt”[3]

— — —in politics: more unity (and discipline) within
 the Party, more struggle against the
 Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries;

— — —in the economy: to satisfy the middle peasantry
 as fully as possible.

4. All the peasantry (almost) has become middle. “Poor
Peasants’
Committees.”[4]

5. What economic satisfaction can we give the middle
peasantry? The petty commodity producer?


N. B. ||| 

(α) to give freedom of turnover, freedom to
trade ( = freedom of capitalism);

(β) to obtain commodities for this purpose.
 

6. “Freedom of turnover ”=freedom to trade=freedom of
capitalism.

Back to capitalism?

Our too hasty, rigid, unprepared “communism” was
necessitated by the war and the impossibility of either
obtaining commodities or setting the factories
going.

There are also a number of other possible transitions.
The “rope” can be given more slack, without allowing any
break in it; it can be “slackened”, “eased out”.

7.

|| N.B.

Co-operation. 
Cancellation of the resolution of the
Ninth Congress. Draft of a new
resolution[5] (to manoeuvre
more freely)


|||

Co-operation=
Socialist-Revolutionaries and
Mensheviks politically
economically the best
form of free turnover

|||



8. How to get the commodities?
 (α) A loan (100 millions in gold)
    (2 proposals).
 (β) Trade agreement with Britain, America.
 (γ) Concessions.

9. State capitalism, a bloc with it, on top; freedom of
turnover for the peasants, etc., below.

Crutches and a bandage?
   Beaten almost to death.

10. Over-fatigue, exhaustion among the workers too.
A “breathing space” like that of Brest, an economic
breathing space.
 To improve the position of the workers (10 millions
in gold and a special
resolution).[6]
 To improve the position of the peasants and promote
turnover.

11. Individual exchange of commodities?
 Yes! We shall intensify production, get turnover
going, provide a breathing space, strengthen the petty
bourgeoisie, but even more so large-scale production
and the proletariat. The one is bound up with the
other.

12. It is impossible to consolidate large-scale production,
the factories and the proletariat, without to some extent
reviving the petty bourgeoisie and its turnover.
 

13. A tax in kind.
 Legislative history (briefly)
Oct. 30,
1918.[7]
 A different way of putting it now.
 Its economic significance:

(1) An incentive to the petty producer: raise production.
 Most important of all.

(2) State monopoly not essential now. (Not all
surpluses.)

(3) Precise obligations to the state.
 Weakening of bureaucracy.

(4) All “turnover” to be more free, and it is possible to
rid them of some of the food “detachments”.

Crop failure
and
a good crop

{{

Popov and his
“reference
notes”[8]

}}

|

Announce
beforehand? After
after
ascertaining the harvest

| N.B. |


14. Firmness of the “apparatus” to be preserved.
 But an apparatus for policy (=reviewing and correcting
relations between classes), and not a policy for the
apparatus!
 (A good) bureaucracy in the service of policy, and not a
policy in the service of (a good) bureaucracy.
 The maximum elasticity is now needed, and for this
purpose, for flexible manoeuvring, the greatest firmness
of the apparatus.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin’s Report on the Substitution of a Tax in Kind for the
Surplus Grain Appropriation System was given at the 14th sitting
of the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) on March 15, 1921 (see
present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 214–28). The Congress adopted a
decision to substitute a tax in kind for the requisitioning of
surplus food and to pass from the policy of War Communism to the
New Economic Policy (NEP). The decision of the Congress on
NEP ensured the sound economic alliance between the working
class and the peasantry for the construction of socialism.





[2]
A reference to Lenin’s book The Proletarian Revolution and the
Renegade Kautsky, 1918, p. 102 (see present edition, Vol. 28,
pp. 305–06).





[3]
A reference to the counter-revolutionary mutiny in Kronstadt
which broke out on February 28, 1921. It was organised by the
S.R.s, Mensheviks and whiteguards and involved a sizable section
of the Kronstadt sailors, most of whom were new recruits from
the countryside, were politically undeveloped and voiced the
peasants’ discontent with the surplus food requisitioning. The mutiny
was facilitated by the economic difficulties in the Soviet state and
the weakening of the Bolshevik organisation in Kronstadt.

The counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, not daring to come
out openly against the Soviet system, resorted to a new tactic:
to deceive the masses, the leaders of the mutiny put forward the
slogan of “Soviets without the Communists”, in the hope of
getting the Communists out of the leadership in the Soviets,
destroying the Soviet system and restoring the capitalist system in the
country.

On March 2, the mutineers arrested the naval command. They
established contacts with foreign imperialists, who promised
them financial and military aid. The seizure of Kronstadt by the
mutineers created a direct threat to Petrograd.

The Soviet Government sent Red Army units under the
command of M. N. Tukhachevsky to suppress the mutiny. The
Communist Party sent more than 300 delegates of the Tenth Party
Congress with military experience, headed by Kliment
Voroshilov, to storm Kronstadt. On March 18, the uprising was liquidated.





[4]
Committees of landless and land-starved peasants in the Ukraine,
set up in 1920 to defend the interests of the poor and middle
peasants. Dissolved in 1933.





[5]
At the Tenth Congress Lenin motioned the proposal to annul
the resolution of the Ninth Congress on the attitude to the
cooperatives, because it was based on the surplus food
appropriation principle, and the Tenth Congress had adopted a resolution
substituting it by a tax in kind. The Tenth Congress adopted
Lenin’s resolution on the co-operatives (see present edition,
Vol. 32, pp. 229–32 and KPSS v resolyutsiyakh..., Part One, 1954,
p. 564).





[6]
A reference to the decision of the Council of Labour and Defence
of February 28, 1921, allocating 10 million gold rubles on the
purchase of food and prime necessities abroad. On Lenin’s
proposal, the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) passed a resolution on
improving the condition of workers and poor peasants (see KPSS
v resolyutsiyakh..., Part One, p. 565).





[7]
A reference to the decree of the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee, “On the Levy of a Tax in Kind on Rural Entrepreneurs
in the Form of a Deduction of a Portion of Their Farm Produce”,
of October 30, 1918, published in Izvestia No. 248, November 
14, 1918.





[8]
For the Tenth Congress of the Party, P. Popov used material of
the Central Statistical Board to write a pamphlet on the question
of the tax and the requisitioning under the title Grain Production
of the Soviet and Federated Republics (Grain Output). Lenin
quoted it in his report (see present edition, Vol. 32, p. 227).

SUMMARY OF A TALK WITH A CORRESPONDENT
       of THE NEW YORK HERALD
The first interview was conducted on March 13, 1921. See HERE for that interview. The second interview, conducted on March 26, 1922, is HERE


 I believe that there are only two kinds of government
possible in Russia—a Government by the Soviets or a
Government headed by a tsar. Some fools or traitors in
Kronstadt talked of a Constituent Assembly, but does any man
in his senses believe for a moment that a Constituent
Assembly at this critical abnormal stage would be anything
but a bear garden. This Kronstadt affair in itself is a very
petty incident. It no more threatens to break up the Soviet
state than the Irish disorders are threatening to break up
the British Empire.

 Some people in America have come to think of the
Bolsheviks as a small clique of very bad men who are
tyrannizing over a vast number of highly intellectual people
who would form an admirable Government among
themselves the moment the Bolshevik regime was overthrown.
This is a mistake, for there is nobody to take our place save
butcher Generals and helpless bureaucrats who have
already displayed their total incapacity for rule.

If people abroad exaggerate the importance of the rising
in Kronstadt and give it support, it is because the world
has broken up into two camps: capitalism abroad and
Communist Russia.

The question is of theoretical interest too:

the proletarian state power
holds
 a material base

{{

factories
railways
foreign trade.



Consequence: in its hands is a commodity stock and its
wholesale (railway) transport.

What is the proletarian state power doing with this stock?
 Selling it:
 (α) to the workers by hand and brain for money,
 or for their labour without money;
 (β) to the peasants for grain.

How does it sell? Through whom?

Through a commission agent (=a trader) for his
percentage on commission.

It gives preference to the co-operatives (trying to
organise the entire population in them).

Why is this impossible? Yet this is capitalism+socialism.

To the first question—yes.

To the second—for a long time yet.

To the third—not “pedagogues and nurse-maids”, but
helpers.

To the fourth—please let me have exact, brief, clear
information on the “two tendencies”.
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The note was in reply to a letter from S. G. Said-Galiev,
Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Tatar
Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, who raised four questions:

“1. Is there need for the existence of small autonomous republics
within the Russian Soviet Federation in general, and of the Tatar
Republic in particular?

“2. If the answer is ‘yes’, then for how long, or, in other words,
until the fulfilment of what tasks or the attainment of what goals?

“3. Is it right to say that the Communists of the formerly
dominant nation, as having a higher level in every respect, should
play the part of pedagogues and nurses to the Communists and
all other working people of the formerly oppressed nationalities,
whose name has been given to the said autonomous republic (region,

   

commune), and that the former should give up their places to the
latter as they grow?

“4. In all autonomous republics, the Tatar Republic in this
case, there are two clearly distinct trends (groupings) among
the native Communists (Tatars): one of them takes the standpoint
of class struggle and works for further class differentiation of the
sections of the native population, and the other has a shade of
petty-bourgeois nationalism....

“Is it right ... that the former should enjoy the full and
all-round support of the whole of the R.C.P.(B.) and its supreme
organs, whereas the latter (insofar as they are sincere and have
a burning desire to work for the proletarian revolution and
insofar as they are useful because of their work) should merely be
made use of and simultaneously educated in a spirit of pure
internationalism, without, however, being given preference over
the former, as has been recently the case not only in the Tatar
Republic?”

Comrade Smolyaninov,

This matter should be followed
up[1] (especially from
the point of view of (1) who is responsible? (2) has it been
properly organised as an independent undertaking?)

If necessary, consult Korostelyov.

Make a note of this business, and follow it up.

September 3

Comrade Gorbunov,

I have just signed credentials for the chairman and
members of the Extraordinary Commission for Exports of the
Council of Labour and
Defence[1] (Rykunov, Pyatigorsky,
Valayev and Vladimir Spiridonovich Yermakov). It will
be your task to study the membership of this Commission
and its terms of reference, then systematically to review
its activity and its reports, and to inform me.

I take advantage of this opportunity to point out to
you the need for a proper division of labour between you
and Smolyaninov (and Boris Volin, if we succeed in
getting him), and proper organisation of the whole work of
the office of the Council of People’s Commissars and the
Council of Labour and Defence.

The functions should be clearly demarcated between
yourself and Smolyaninov. Each must “carry on supervision”
of specified undertakings (electric ploughs; Hydropeat Board;
collective supply; wage rates, etc., etc.).

For each subject, both “old” and newly arising, there
must be systematic filing of all papers and reference notes,
so that it should always be easy to find what is required.

In addition to the distribution between you of the
business of the “economic front”, the most important front
at the present time, there should also be a division between
you (or you should take them all on yourself) of the
noneconomic People’s Commissariats, “following up” their
work on the basis of the reports of the gubernia and uyezd
economic conferences and otherwise.
 

On each “subject” it is necessary from time to time (once
a week, once a month or every two months, according to
the nature and importance of the business—and then also
suddenly) to carry out a check on actual fulfilment. This
is most important and most essential. A record should
be made of the results of each check-up.

I think that when there are three of you (you+
Smolyaninov+B. Volin or someone else, if we can’t have Volin)
this will be enough (with a few office assistants) to carry
on the whole work, of course on condition of absolute
efficiency, on the one hand, and of referring everything that
can and should be referred to Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn, to the
State Planning Commission and other appropriate
institutions, on the other. To read the uyezd reports it will
be necessary to recruit a number of other people, each being
obliged to sign that he has read it, on a sheet attached to
each report: we shall draw in both writers and some of the
oldest members of the Party, as well as some “experts”.
When the number of reports arriving begins to grow, you
will draw up a list of “helpers in the reading of reports”
and establish a strict procedure for returning what has been
read.

Take a typed copy of this letter, and send it to me,
together with your reply about a plan for distributing and
carrying on all the work of the Executive Secretary of
the C.P.C. and the Council of Labour and Defence.

In particular, it is necessary to follow up with special
attention the work of the Hydropeat Board, both in connection
with the orders for peat pumps already placed abroad for
the 1922 season, and in connection with the recent
communication from R. E. Klasson that he has solved the
problem of
dehydration.[2]

Then I ask you to investigate the affair of the idleness
of the Swedish works, Nydqvist och Holms (
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn No. 194,
p. 4).[3] “They were slow in getting
out” the order for water-driven turbines! Of which we have
a terrible lack! This is the height of disgrace and
shamelessness!

||

Make sure to find out who is to blame so that we can
send these scoundrels to rot in prison.

||



Find out who precisely is personally responsible for the
work of this factory, and for the orders placed with it.
 

Altogether, the establishment of specified personal
responsibility is the most important job for the Executive
Secretary of the C.P.C. and the Council of Labour and
Defence. I will require this more strictly than anything
else. If it proves necessary, call in immediately for this
purpose the People’s Commissariat for Justice, arid the
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, or an “expert” from
them.

One more thing. It seems to me that the Scientific and
Technical Department of the Supreme Economic Council
has fallen asleep altogether. It is essential either to wake
it up, or really to set going a drive to disperse these
scientific loafers, and establish precisely and without fail who
will be responsible for keeping us abreast of European and
American techniques sensibly, in good time, practically,
not bureaucratically. In particular, Moscow should have
one specimen of all the most important latest machines:
to learn and to teach. (Two engineers have told me that in
America they make roads with a machine which transforms
a dirt road into a hard road simply by the force of its own
pressure; how important this would be for our roadless
semi-civilised country!)

We must see that the Scientific and Technical
Department of the Supreme Economic Council, and its numerous
idlers abroad, should stop idling, or that we should replace
them by others.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Extraordinary Commission for Exports under the Council of Labour
and Defence was formed on August 10, 1921, to help the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Trade in building up an export stock
and concentrating it in its hands. The Commission consisted of
representatives of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade,
the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, the All-Russia
Extraordinary Commission, the Supreme Economic Council and the People’s
Commissariat for Food.

Sweden”, carried by Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn No. 194, September 
2, 1921, saying that the power section of the State Planning
Commission was told, during its discussion of conclusions on a project
for turbine installations, worked out for the Volkhov and Svir
construction sites, that the order for hydroturbines could be placed
with the Swedish plant of Nydqvist och Holms, which was at
the complete disposal of the Soviet Government as of July 1, 1921.
At that time, its large turbine department was idle for lack of
orders. Speakers at the sitting noted that because of delay in
placing the order, the turbine department of the plant was being run
at a loss. The power section decided to take steps to place the
order at once and to raise this matter at the next sitting of the
Council of People’s Commissars through the Presidium of the State
Planning Commission. Lenin’s intervention speeded up the
solution of this question.

Comrade Kiselyov, Chairman of the Narrow Council
 Copies to Comrades Bogdanov, Unshlikht, Avanesov
 and Kursky

I draw your attention to the note by Mikhels in 
Izvestia No. 203 of
Sept. 13.[1]

The author writes that since 1918, 2.5 million poods
of most valuable metal cargoes have been lying in store,
almost in a swamp, unregistered and unguarded, and are
being pilfered and ruined.

I ask you urgently to check up if that is true.

If it is, take all the necessary steps immediately to
register, preserve, etc., this property, and to bring those
guilty most strictly to book.

Give me a detailed written report, pointing out the names
and posts of the persons guilty of this scandal, and make
a communication to the Council of Labour and Defence.

I ask you to do all this with the utmost urgency.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
V. A. Mikhels—journalist who wrote the item “Destitute
Billionaires”, pointing to the crying disorder at the warehouses in
Lizino station of the Moscow-Kazan Railway, where 2.5 million
poods of metal, costly machines, equipment and tools had not
been inventoried and were lying in the open.

Chairman of the Supreme Economic Council P. A. Bogdanov
sent Lenin (in reply to his letter of September 15) a report from
the chief of the State Warehouse Administration under the
Supreme Economic Council, I. K. Yezhov, who complained of a
shortage of warehouse space, multiplicity of authority, and a struggle
for warehouse space between various departments. For Lenin’s reply
to Yezhov’s report, see present edition, Vol. 35, pp.523–24.

Discuss the following, and let’s make a final draft:
That it should he recognised as absolutely necessary
to pay particularly great attention to collecting 
information (both through special correspondents, without however
appointing them only for this purpose, and through all the
special representatives of the Council of Labour and
Defence and the People’s Commissariats; and likewise—most
important of all—from the regular local reports to the
appropriate bodies), information coming directly from local
bodies (works, mines, separate log camps, etc.). The
collection and analysis of information coming, not only from
the Chief Boards, but from these organs operating on the
spot, must become one of the most important tasks of 
Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Fuel Commission of the Council of Labour and Defence,
which was headed by Lenin, decided on September 30, 1921
that G. I. Krumin was to “work out the question of improving
the business of publication in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn of reports
on the fuel operations of the Central Timber Board, as a matter
of priority, and to submit to the Council, within a week, a draft
decree, which he was to show Lenin beforehand” =

(Central Party
Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.P.S.U.
Central Committee). The draft submitted by Krumin apparently
did not satisfy Lenin, and he wrote the document which served
as a draft for the C.L.D. decision of October 7.

October 15

Comrade Avanesov,

Should not part of the shock transport works be handed
over by the Supreme Economic Council to the People’s
Commissariat for Communications (in connection with
yesterday’s
question)?[1]

The consumer must be given an incentive.

Think it over.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

As regards storage. Let’s decree:

Workers in stores receive a bonus for clearing 1/8, 1/4,
1/2 of the store if they dispatch (deliver) its contents
directly to state productive enterprises (factories, state farms,
and the like).

The same bonus is given to those drawing these materials
from the stores for delivery to the same factories, etc.

Unless there is personal interest, no damned thing will
come of it. We must find a way to produce incentives.

But Troyanovsky is not clever. You will answer for such
a “chairman”, you personally. Bear that in mind.

You need a clever man on this job.

Lenin

 THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY
 AND THE TASKS OF POLITICAL EDUCATION WORKERS

1. Not in the straightforward communist fashion, but
“by outflanking and with a special approach”.

2. Defeat and retreat—for a new advance.

3. Who will be able to take advantage sooner, the
capitalists or ourselves?

4. “Personal incentives”.... Peasants, workers, experts,
a mass of stupidities in our attitude to the latter.

5. To learn from capitalists and lessees.
 A serious and harsh schooling.

6. Increase in production at all costs.


[BOX:

You are outside the institutions? It is oven better that
you are outside.

]



7. Literacy. Liquidation of illiteracy, and not in the
clouds+and liquidating the Commission for Liquidation.
July 19,
1920.[2]

A disgraceful list of gubernias and uyezds lagging
in respect of literacy.

8. Raising of cultural level
     (after every great political upheaval, a long time
goes into “digestion”, “assimilation”, training to make
use, finishing the rough-hewn work of initial construction).

9. Improvement of legality ... teach people to struggle
in a civilised way for legality, without at all forgetting

    

the limits of legality in a revolution. That’s not the evil
now, it’s the multitude of illegalities.

10. In particular, graft. Who has done what to fight
graft.

10 bis. Bureaucracy and red tape.

11. Production propaganda, bringing to the fore economic
successes possible here and now for the peasant, ability
to single out, use for propaganda, follow up success.

12. Practical successes in the building of the economy—
that is the point. The touchstone of everything.

Three enemies:

13. σσ Four commandments:

Communist conceit—this
is the enemy

{{

(1) Don’t split hairs, don’t be
pompous in your
communism, don’t use great words
to cover up your slackness,
idleness, apathy,
backwardness;



Illiteracy
 Graft

{

(2) Wipe out illiteracy;


{

(3) Fight graft;


σσ

{{

σσ

(4) Check all your work, so that
words should not remain
words, by practical successes
in economic construction.

Comrade Kursky,

You should go deeply into the question of leases and
concessions in agriculture.

You have not gone into it sufficiently.

Prohibition of leasing in principle is of vast importance.
He who works the land has possession of it.

There must be no leasing.

But leasing of a state farm or “uncultivated land”?

This must be separated out.

This is a special type.

Whoever works has possession here too. The state is the
owner, the tenant of the state farm cultivates. This is,
strictly speaking, not a tenant, nor is it a lease in the
ordinary sense.

Rather it is transfer of management.

It is essential to make a more detailed and circumstantial
study of the matter.

1921

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written during the preparations for the Ninth Congress of Soviets,
which discussed the question of measures to build up and develop
agriculture. Lease of land was prohibited under the legislation
then in force (Decree on Land adopted by the Second Congress of
Soviets and the Law on the Socialisation of Land). The transition
to NEP and the need to take steps to strengthen and develop
peasant farming raised the question of allowing some lease of land.
The Ninth Congress discussed it and adopted a relevant decision.
Only labour and short-term lease of land was allowed under the
Land Code of the R.S.F.S.R. adopted by the Fourth Session of the
Ninth All-Russia Central Executive Committee in October 1922
(see present edition, Vol. 33, p. 392).

Concessions in agriculture were governed by special legislation.

Comrade Bukharin,

I enclose my notes in connection with the theme assigned

thinking about this theme, and planned:

(α) setting out the subjects of dispute, difference and
split;

(β) alternation of periods of split and periods of unity;

(γ) alternation of periods of a majority for the
Mensheviks and for the Bolsheviks (maybe it could be represented
in a diagram?).

Drop me a line about your opinion.

Notes
 
 



[1]
Written in connection with the discussion of the tactics of a
united working-class front. Initially the question was discussed by
the Party’s Central Committee on December 1, 1921, which
approved the line of joint action with workers in the Second, the
Two-and-a-Half and the Amsterdam Internationals. It was dealt
within a special (19th) paragraph of the theses “On the United
Working-Class Front and the Attitude to Workers in the Second,
the Two-and-a-Half, and the Amsterdam Internationals, and also
to Workers Supporting Anarcho-Syndicalist Organisations”. =

The
theses were adopted by the Executive Committee of the
Comintern, and the Eleventh All-Russia Conference of the R.C.P.(B.)
(December 19–22, 1921) acceded to them. A more detailed
discussion of the theses was held by the first enlarged Plenary Meeting
of the Comintern Executive Committee (February 21–March 4),
which adopted them. They were endorsed by the Fourth Congress
of the Comintern.

For the above-mentioned Paragraph 19, see KPSS v
resolyutsiyakh..., Part One, 1954, pp. 585–86.





[2]
The reference is evidently to the Fourth Duma.





[3]
First All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies was held from June 3 to 24 (June 16 to July 7), 1917.





[4]
The numerical proportion of the votes of the Bolsheviks and the
Mensheviks at the Second Congress of the R.S.D.L.P., where 20 
Bolshevik delegates had 24 votes, and the Mensheviks—following
the withdrawal of 2 Rabocheye Dyelo delegates and 5 Bundists,
who supported them—20 votes, a total of 44.





[5]
A reference to the Bolshevik Third Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.
held in London in April and May 1905, and the parallel conference
of Mensheviks in Geneva.





[6]
A reference to the distribution of votes at the Fourth (Stockholm,
“Unity”) Congress and the Fifth (London) Congress of the Party,
that is, the period when the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks were
formally members of the same party, with a single Central
Committee and regular conferences, etc.

Of the 112 delegates with vote at the Fourth Congress, the
Bolsheviks had 46, the Mensheviks, 62, and the rest belonged to
non-factional Social-Democrats. The Mensheviks had a small edge
and so the Congress adopted Menshevik resolutions on some
questions. In his Appeal to the Party on the question of this Congress
Lenin wrote:

“We must and shall fight ideologically against those decisions
of the Congress which we regard as erroneous. But at the same
time we declare to the whole Party that we are opposed to a split
of any kind. We stand for submission to the decisions of the
Congress....

“We call upon all our fellow-thinkers to accept such submission
and such ideological struggle.” (See present edition, Vol. 10,
p. 314). However, the Congress decision on Party unity remained
on paper, for the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks kept to their
respective views and retained their separate organisations.

Of the 336 delegates with vote at the Fifth Congress, the
Bolsheviks had 105, the Mensheviks 97, the Bundists 57, the Polish
Social-Democrats 44, the Lettish Social-Democrats 29, and “
non-Party” delegates 4. The Bolsheviks had the Poles and the
Latvians with them, and so commanded a stable majority. On all
questions of principle the Congress passed Bolshevik resolutions.
The Congress elected a Central Committee consisting of five
Bolsheviks, 4 Mensheviks, 2 Polish and 1 Lettish Social-Democrats.
Candidate members included 10 Bolsheviks, 7 Mensheviks, 3
Poles and 2 Latvians.

The Congress marked a major victory for Bolshevism over the
Party’s opportunist wing, the Mensheviks. For details on the
Fifth Congress, see Lenin’s article “The Attitude towards
Bourgeois Parties”, present edition, Vol. 12, pp. 489–509.





[7]
The miscellany Marxism and Liquidationism, published in 1914,
gave figures on the workers’ collections for various purposes by
supporters of the Bolsheviks and of the liquidators. These figures
proved that the majority of workers rallied round the Bolsheviks.
Collections in aid of strikers at various factories and in various
industries, for persons who had been victimised, and for various
other needs of the working-class movement, carried through the
Duma groups of the Bolsheviks and the liquidators, reached the
following figures for the period from October 1913 to June 6,
1914 (according to reports in Bolshevik and liquidators’ papers):
through the Bolshevik group, 12,891.24 rubles (number of

__PRINTERS_P_707_COMMENT__
45*

   

workers’ groups, 1,295); through the liquidators’ group, 6,114.87
rubles (number of workers’ groups, 215); the Bolsheviks received
only 6 per cent from non-workers, and the liquidators, 46 per 
cent. The number of group collections by workers for the
working-class press was distributed as follows (by May 1914): for the
Bolshevik papers (Pravda and Rabochy Put) roughly 6,000 and for
the liquidators’ newspaper (Luch) a total of 1,500 (see present
edition, Vol. 20, pp. 381–87).





[8]
A reference to the proportion of votes polled by the Mensheviks
and the Bolsheviks during the election to the Constituent Assembly
in November 1917. For details, see Lenin’s article “The
Constituent Assembly Elections and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat”
(present edition, Vol. 30, p. 254).

Very urgent

Avanesov, Kursky and Tsyurupa

I suspect a small military stratagem on the part of
Osinsky and Bogdanov, who today, in my absence, are
raising the question of reversing the decision of the Council
of Labour and Defence about the prosecution of persons
guilty of bureaucratic delays in the manufacture of the
Fowler
ploughs.[1] Please give attention to this matter,
and use your influence against reversing the decision. There
is no doubt that in this affair there are people guilty
of red tape, and from the standpoint of principle it is
essential not to leave such matters within the confines
of bureaucratic institutions, but to bring them out into the
public court—not so much for the sake of inflicting strict
punishment (perhaps a reprimand will suffice), but for
the sake of publicity and for dispelling the universal
conviction that guilty persons are not punished.

Notes
 
 



[1]
In October and November 1921, the case of red tape in the
manufacture of the ploughs was repeatedly on the agenda of the Council
of Labour and Defence. The collegium of the Metal Department
of the Supreme Economic Council, which was instructed by the
Presidium of the Council in May 1920 to manufacture the ploughs,
displayed impermissible laxity and irresponsibility which doomed
the programme from the outset. The Extraordinary Three-Man
Committee set up to co-ordinate the operations took an extremely
formal attitude to the task, and confined itself to the writing
of reports and all sorts of correspondence between the departments.
Its members did not have the courage to inform their superiors
that the plan could not be fulfilled and that it was no use wasting
money. It failed to inform either the Council of Labour and
Defence or the Council of People’s Commissars of the state of affairs.
At great cost over a period of almost two years, five experimental
ploughs were manufactured out of a planned total of 2,000. The
case was referred to the Moscow Military Tribunal, which in early
January 1922 ruled that there was substance in the charges against
the officials of the Supreme Economic Council and the People’s
Commissariat for Agriculture to the effect that they had been
derelict in their duties, but, in view of their previous record in
rehabilitating the economy, decided to forgo punishment. In
addition, on the proposal of the tribunal, the Council of Labour
and Defence issued an administrative rebuke to the Presidium
of the Supreme Economic Council and the collegium of the
People’s Commissariat for Agriculture for their insufficiently
serious attitude to the manufacture of the Fowler ploughs (see
Lenin’s letter to Bogdanov on December 23, 1921 in this volume,
pp. 556–58).

December 23, 1921

Comrade Bogdanov,

I consider all your arguments about the Fowler ploughs
affair to be completely wrong in principle. True, your error
is not so indecent (excuse my strong language) as that of
Osinsky, who has frankly become a defender of the worst
kind of bureaucracy; nevertheless what you say does not
look good either.

We must not be afraid of the courts (our courts are
proletarian) or of publicity, but must drag bureaucratic delays
out into daylight for the people’s judgement: only in this
way shall we manage to really cure this disease.

Your argument is that the people involved are
exceptionally good, devoted and valuable workers.

Let’s suppose that this is true, that you are not a victim
of “departmental bias”.

What follows from this?

Only this, that the court—if it agrees with you ire this
respect (and you, probably, since you firmly believe it,
will present a number of most serious witnesses to prove
it)—will bring in a verdict that:

they are guilty of failing to eliminate bureaucratic
delays and of mismanagement; but, taking into
account their exceptional loyalty to the Soviet
power, completely proved by a number of witnesses,
their outstanding conscientiousness and zeal, also
completely proved, taking into account the general
defects in the machinery of the Supreme Economic
Council, partly due to the change of Presidium, etc.

    


... decides not to inflict any punishment, in the
belief that the accused will take this seriously to
heart, as will the entire Presidium of the Supreme
Economic Council.

Well, if approximately such a decision were taken, can
you deny its usefulness—its social significance, 1,000 times
greater than a secret-Party-Central-Committee-idiotic
hushing up of a rotten case about rotten bureaucracy and
avoiding publicity?

You are absolutely wrong in principle. We don’t know
how to conduct a public trial for rotten bureaucracy: for
this all of us, and particularly the People’s Commissariat
for Justice, should be hung on stinking ropes. And I have
not yet lost all hope that one day we shall be hung for this,
and deservedly so.

If you think that in the R.S.F.S.R. we cannot find a
single sensible prosecutor and three sensible judges, really
sensible (not over-hasty, not shouters, not phrase-mongers),
then I accuse you also of pessimism about the Soviet power.
I am sending a copy of this letter (together with your letter)
to Comrade Kursky, with a special request that ho read it
himself and let it be read by as many jurists as possible,
and that he, Kursky, should consider himself specifically
responsible for selecting an unquestionably sensible
prosecutor and sensible judges for this trial.
And that Kursky
should be personally responsible for
(1) the maximum
acceleration of the proceedings and
(2) letting me have a
stenographic report of this trial (to draw the conclusion as
to whether at last our very feeble People’s Commissariat
for Justice is learning to organise and carry through public
trials of bureaucracy). It is time we began to learn.

I don’t understand why a sensible prosecutor should
not in face of the whole public completely shatter, ridicule
and disgrace a “Bogdanovist” and “Osinskyist” defence
of bureaucratic red tape, and at the same time draw up
a wise, correct and balanced charge.

Why should not a sentence be possible approximately
on the following lines:

Attaching exceptional importance to the public
trial of cases of bureaucratic delay, we hand down
in this case a very lenient sentence, in view of the

    

exceptionally rare conscientiousness of the accused;
at the same time giving a warning that in future
we shall punish for such delays the most saintly, but
negligent dunderheads (the court perhaps will
express itself more politely), because we, the
R.S.F.S.R., do not need saintliness, but efficient
management.

And, therefore, if we inflict no penalty on this
occasion on Lomov and
Styunkel[1] on account of
their “saintliness”, we sentence
Unksov[2] (I think
that’s the name?), whose duty it was to submit
reports to the Council of Labour and Defence and who
failed to do so, to a week’s arrest; we proclaim
Ilyin[3] (director of the former Ilyin factory?) and the
entire works committee of this factory, and the
entire executive of the (corresponding) trade union,
and the entire membership of the communist group
of such-and-such a factory, or such-and-such
factories, guilty of red tape, negligence and
connivance at bureaucracy, and inflict on them a severe
reprimand and public censure, with a warning that
it is only for this first time that we are inflicting
such mild penalties, but in future will for such
behaviour send all such trade union and communist
scoundrels (the court, perhaps, will express itself
more mildly) mercilessly to jail.

With communist greetings,
 V. Ulyanov (Lenin)

   TO COMRADES BUKHARIN, ZINOVIEV AND MOLOTOV
    (FOR MEMBERS OF THE POLITICAL BUREAU)

On the subject of yesterday’s report from Hanover that
the International Federation of Metalworkers is raising the
question of struggle against war and has adopted a
resolution to respond to war with a
strike,[1] I suggest the
following:

1. That a number of articles be printed in Pravda and
Izvestia, giving a reminder of the fate of the Basle
Manifesto and a detailed explanation of all the childishness
or all the social-treachery, now being repeated by the
metal-workers.

2. That at the next enlarged meeting of the Executive
Committee of the Comintern there be put on the agenda the
question of struggle against war, and that circumstantial
resolutions be adopted explaining that only a ready and
experienced revolutionary party, with a good illegal
machinery, can successfully wage a struggle against war, and
that the means of struggle is not a strike against war, but
the formation of revolutionary groups in the warring
armies and their preparation for the carrying out of a
revolution.

February 4, 1922

Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
A reference to the following telegram published in Pravda and
Izvestia on February 3, 1922: “Hanover, January 31 (Radio).
The International Metalworkers’ Federation has proposed to the
Commission for the Convocation of an International Workers’
Congress due to open in Rome on April 21, that a general strike of
the organised workers should be declared in the event of the
outbreak of war. The Metalworkers’ Federation has elected a special
commission for the vigorous propaganda of its proposal.” =

This
decision was taken by the Vienna conference of the Executive
Committee of the International Metalworkers’ Federation, which
was affiliated to the reformist Amsterdam International of Trade
Unions. The latter existed from 1919 to 1945.

February 20, 1922

Comrade Kursky,

The activity of the People’s Commissariat for Justice
is apparently not yet at all adapted to the New Economic
Policy.

Previously, the militant organs of the Soviet power were
chiefly the People’s Commissariat for the Army and the
All-Russia Extraordinary Commission. An especially
militant role now falls to the People’s Commissariat for Justice
(P.C.J.); unfortunately, there is no evidence of any
understanding of this on the part of the leadership and the
senior members of the P.C.J.

Intensification of reprisals against the political enemies
of the Soviet power and the agents of the bourgeoisie (
specifically the Mensheviks and S.R.s); mounting of these
reprisals by revolutionary tribunals and people’s courts
in the swiftest, most revolutionary and expedient manner;

    

compulsory staging of a number of model (as regards speed
and force of repression, and explanation of their significance
to the masses of people through the courts and the press)
trials in Moscow, Petrograd, Kharkov and several other key
centres; influence on the people’s judges and members of
revolutionary tribunals through the Party in the sense
of improving the activity of the courts and intensifying
the reprisals—all of this must be conducted systematically,
persistently, with doggedness and mandatory reports (in
the most concise, telegraphic style but business-like and
exact, with obligatory statistics of how the P.C.J. chastises
and learns to chastise the “communist” scoundrels who
predominate among us and who know how to chatter and
put on airs, but not how to work).

The fighting role of the P.C.J. is equally important in
the sphere of NEP, and here the P.C.J.’s weakness and
apathy is even more outrageous. There is no evidence of
any understanding of the fact that we recognise and will
continue to recognise only state capitalism, and it is we—
we conscious workers, we Communists—who are the state.
That is why we should brand as good-for-nothing
Communists those who have failed to understand their task of
restricting, curbing, checking and catching red-handed and
inflicting exemplary chastisement on any kind of 
capitalism that goes beyond the framework of state capitalism
in our meaning of the concept and tasks of the state.

It is the P.C.J., it is the people’s courts that are here
faced with an especially militant and especially
responsible task. There is no sign that it has been grasped. The
papers make noises about the abuse of NEP. These abuses
are innumerable.

But where is the noise about model trials of the
scoundrels abusing the New Economic Policy? There is no such
noise, because there are no such trials. The P.C.J. has
“forgotten” that that is its business, that it is its duty to
pull up, shake up and rouse the people’s courts and teach
them to be ruthless and swift in chastising—with every
means, including the firing squad—for abuse of the New
Economic Policy. It is responsible for this. There is no
evidence of any vibrant activity in this sphere on the part
of the P.C.J., because there is no such activity.
 

The educational role of the courts is tremendous. How
do we show concern for this? How do we take account of
the real results? There is nothing of the sort, but that
happens to be the ABC of juridical work.

It is just as elementary that triple penalties should be
inflicted on Communists, as compared with non-Party people.
There again the P.C.J. has shown little concern.

Under the tsar, the procurators were sacked or promoted
on the strength of the percentage of cases they won. We
managed to adopt the worst of tsarist Russia—red tape
and sluggishness—and this is virtually stifling us, but we
failed to adopt its good practices. Every member of the P.C.J.
Collegium, every worker of this Commissariat should be
assessed according to his record, on the strength of the
following figures: how many Communists have you jailed with
triple sentences, as compared with non-Party people, for
the same offences? How many bureaucrats have you jailed
for red tape and procrastination? How many merchants
caught abusing NEP have you sentenced to be shot or
to some other no-joke penalty (for ridiculous penalties
are frequently imposed in Moscow, under the very
nose of the P.C.J.)? You can’t answer the question? This
means that you are an idler who should be expelled from
the Party for “communist chatter” and for “communist
conceit”.

The new civil legislation is being drafted. I find that the
P.C.J. is “swimming with the tide”. But its task is to swim
against the tide. Its task is to create a new civil law, and
not to adopt (rather, not to allow itself to be duped by the
old and stupid bourgeois lawyers who adopt) the old,
bourgeois concept of civil law. It should not give in to the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, which “ex officio” conducts
the line of “adaptation to Europe”, but combat this line and
work out a new civil law, a new attitude to “private”
contracts, etc. We do not recognise anything “private”, and regard
everything in the economic sphere as falling under public and
not private law. We allow only state capitalism, and
as has been said, it is we who are the slate. Hence, the
task is to extend the application of state intervention in
“private legal” relations; to extend the right of the state
to annul “private” contracts; to apply to “civil legal relations”

    

not the corpus juris romani but our revolutionary concept of
law; to show systematically, persistently, with
determination, through a series of model trials, how this should be
done wisely and vigorously; to brand through the Party
and expel those members of revolutionary tribunals and
people’s judges who fail to learn this or refuse to
understand it.

Unless the P.C.J. rouses itself at once and vigorously
starts working in a new, militant way, along new lines,
it will be disgraced before Genoa (and the whole world).

I propose to you that 

1) you read my letter to all members of the P.C.J.
Collegium;

2) ditto—at a meeting of 100–200 Communists
exclusively, who practise in the sphere of civil, criminal
and constitutional law;


3) prohibit, on pain of Party responsibility, to chatter
about it (about this letter), for it is stupid to disclose our
strategy to the enemy;

4) get a number of Communists, working in the courts
and in the P.C.J., who are quite agreed with the spirit
of this letter, to publish some articles in the press and give
a number of public lectures on these topics;

5) allocate responsibility between all members of the
Collegium (and if possible between other prominent
Communists working in the P.C.J.):

a) for the sections in charge of the new civil
legislation (specifically and highly important);

b) ditto criminal legislation;

c) ditto constitutional
 and political legislation


}} less urgent



d) for staging and conducting model, widely
publicised and educational trials in the said centres;

e) for the business-like—and not just for the record—
control over people’s courts and revolutionary
tribunals, to see that they manage in fact to 
intensify reprisals also against the political enemies
of the Soviet power (the P.C.J. will be the first
to blame if these reprisals are not also intensified)
and against NEP abuses.
 


||

We allow you to trade and make money, but insist that
you be thrice as honest, that you submit truthful and exact
accounts, that you abide not only by the letter but also by
the spirit of our, communist legislation, that you do not
allow the slightest departure from our laws—that is what
the P.C.J. should adopt as its main commandment in
respect of NEP. If the P.C.J. fails to make our capitalism
“disciplined” and “decent”; if the P.C.J. fails to prove
by a series of model trials that it knows how to trap
offenders against this rule and chastise, not with the
disgracefully stupid fine of 100 or 200 millions—which
is shortsighted from the communist standpoint—but
with shooting, then the P.C.J. is good for nothing and
I shall deem it my duty to get the Central Committee
to agree to a total replacement of all senior workers of
the P.C.J.

Please inform me as soon as possible of the allocation
of the said work between all members of the P.C.J.
Collegium to show me, with the utmost precision, who
specifically (with the exception of the People’s Commissar,
who is responsible for everything) is responsible for which
departments of civil law, (and then also of criminal
law, etc.), and for the staging of model trials (each
member of the Collegium must show his mettle in
staging and conducting several model trials) and for
the business-like control over revolutionary tribunals
and people’s courts, judicial investigators, etc., in
such-and-such a gubernia or such-and-such a district
of Moscow.

What we need is not a division of “departments” and
bureaucratic slumber on that, but personal responsibility
on the part of every Communist on the Collegium for a
specific area of live revolutionary work. That is what the
People’s Commissar must achieve and prove that he is
capable of achieving it.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars
 

P.S. There must not be the slightest mention of my
letter in the press. Let anyone, who so wishes, write in his
own name, without any mention of mine, and provide as
many concrete data as possible.

      ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DRAFT DIRECTIVES
    TO THE NARROW COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S
 COMMISSARS[1]

Comrade Tsyurupa,

I think we arc still radically at odds. The main thing,
in my opinion, is to shift the centre of gravity from writing
decrees and orders (our stupidities in this respect verge on
idiocy) to selection of people and checking fulfilment.
This is the essential point.

Is the Narrow Council unsuitable for this? Let’s assume
that. Then you and Rykov must devote 9/10ths of your
time to it (it is ridiculous to expect the Workers’ and
Peasants’ Inspection and the Executive Secretary to do more
than fulfil simple instructions). All of us are sunk in the
rotten bureaucratic swamp of “departments”. Great
authority, common sense and strong will are necessary for the
everyday struggle against this. The departments are shit;
decrees are shit. To find men and check up on their work—
that is the whole point. If you+Rykov set about this for
9/10ths of your time, and make the Executive Secretary
(and sometimes also members of the Narrow Council of
People’s Commissars) your assistants, then perhaps we can
get by.

Send me once again your draft about the Narrow Council
of People’s Commissars.

Lenin

February 28

Comrade Sheinman,

Your words that the State Bank is now a “powerful
apparatus” (Feb. 22) made me laugh. Let me say in confidence:
this is the height of childishness, the height of
Communist-mandarin childishness.

A “powerful apparatus”! The “powerful apparatus”=
transferring from one state pocket into another such
remarkable “real values” as Soviet rubles.... Current accounts
expressed in gold rubles (and even that falsely, not at the
real parity) 2.8–7.9–10.3 million rubles (on Dec. 16, Jan. 
16, and Feb. 1). Ha-ha! And how are they made up? 90–98
per cent are revenues from our state trusts, i.e., the same
official bits of paper from the same bureaucrats!

At present the State Bank=a bureaucratic paper game.
There is the truth for you, if you want to hear not the sweet
communist-official lies (with which everyone feeds you
as a high mandarin), but the truth.

And if you don’t want to look at this truth with open
eyes, through all the communist lying, you are a man who
has perished in the prime of life in a swamp of official lying.
Now that is an unpleasant truth, but it is the truth.

Either to seek and gradually to find (testing and checking
one hundred times) people capable of organising trade on
behalf of the State Bank, checking on trade, encouraging
business-like traders, closing down allegedly commercial,
but in reality communist-bureaucratic trading and factory
“Potemkin
villages”[1]—or the entire State Bank and all
its work is zero, worse than zero, self-deception with a new
bureaucratic rattle.
 

And until you prove to me by acts, backed up by
experience, that the State Bank has begun to find such men,
inspectors, agents, etc., until then there is nothing to talk
about: I won’t believe a word you say.

Please don’t be angry for this frankness.

Yours,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Potemkin villages—an early 19th-century expression denoting
window-dressing. During a tour of the south of Russia by the
Empress Catherine II in 1787, the Governor-General of the
Yekaterinoslav Vicegerency, G. A. Potemkin, gave her the
impression of exceptional welfare among the population by
stage-mounting various decorative villages, arches, parks, etc.

Copies to Comrades Molotov and Tsyurupa

Comrade Tikhomirov,

In my opinion, no alterations are needed.

It is not the co-operative movement that should be
adapted to the New Economic Policy, but the New Economic
Policy to the co-operative movement.

The parallel with the trade unions is incorrect, a
parallel with the Soviets would be nearer the truth.

The old structure should be retained. All attention and
all effort should be concentrated on selecting people (this
is our weak spot), and getting the better of private trade.

Everything towards this end.

No reorganisations.

Are there any practical successes? I am afraid, not.

Turnover

Sept.—1
 Oct.—3
 Nov.—6
 Dec.—10 million pre-war rubles?

and

Jan.—1922?

What is the percentage of expenses? Are the local
cooperatives growing weaker or stronger?

With communist greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Differences on organisation appeared among workers in
consumers’ co-operative societies in early 1922. There was the question
of separating workers’ co-operatives from the rest, and this was
generally accepted among the leadership and rank-and-file
cooperators. One of them, Tikhomirov, informed Lenin of this
mood, and was sent the present note in reply.

March 19

Comrade Stepanov,

I have just finished looking through 160 pages of your
book.[1]

Just as I was furious in cursing you (up to and including
bad language) for being able at such a time to spend months
over refuting
Cunow,[2] so I am delighted with this book.
Now this is a real achievement! Now this is a model of
how one should teach the Russian savage from the ABC
onwards, and to teach him not a “half-science” but the
whole of science.

Write (after you have had a proper rest) another such
little book on the history of religion and against all
religion (including the Kantian and other subtly idealistic
or subtly agnostic religion), with a survey of material on
the history of atheism and on the links between the church
and the bourgeoisie.

Once more: greetings and congratulations on a splendid
success.

Yours,
 Lenin

P.S. There is something wrong on page 97. Respondek has
muddled
matters.[3] I advise you to take the original
source and have a check made. I enclose a letter to Popov
(you can send it through my secretary).

P.P.S. I am sending my preface to the
secretary.[4]
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
The MS. of a book by I. I. Skvortsov-Stepanov, The Electrification
of the R.S.F.S.R. and the Transitional Phase of the World
Economy, which he prepared under an assignment from Lenin.

It was published in March 1922 with Lenin’s introduction.





[2]

H. Cunow’s book, Ursprung der Religion und des Gottesglaubens,
published in Germany in 1913 and translated by
Skvortsov-Stepanov into Russian in 1919. That same year it was issued by
Kommunist Publishers under the title The Origin of Religion
and Belief in God.





[3]
A reference to a table from the book by Dr. G. Respondek, 
Weltwirtschaftlicher Stand und Aufgaben der Elektroindustrie, Berlin,
1920, cited by Skvortsov-Stepanov on p. 97 to show the level
of electrification of some industries in the United States. Lenin

   

questioned the figure of 1,585,953 given under the head of “HP
Requirements” for the textile industry, electrical engineering
and foundries and machine-building plants.

In explaining why the figure was the same for these branches,
Skvortsov-Stepanov said in a note to the table: “These figures
are dubious because of their absolute equality. The table has
been taken from Respondek’s book, p. 3. He himself is a
sufficiently careful writer. He must have taken these data from American
sources which are not always precise.”

Electrification of the R.S.F.S.R. and the Transitional Phase of the World

46).

1. On Genoa briefly to repeat what
was said on Mar. 6,
1922.[2]

(+delegation
composed. — Directives
carefully discussed
more than once.—“We
are ready.”)

2. NEP. The main points of this
“question”:
 (a) Testing the “link” with the
peasant economy.

3. (b) The test by competition
between state and capitalist
enterprises (both commercial
and industrial; both Russian and
foreign).

4.

((State capitalism.
“We” are the state.))

(c) “State capitalism.”
Scholastic versus revolutionary and
practical meaning of this term.

5.

The scouting sortie
has been made.
Mixed companies.

(d) Halting the retreat. Not in
the sense: “We’ve already,
learned”, but in the sense: don’t
have nerves, don’t invent, but
learn on the present ground; “
regrouping of forces and
preparation”= the watchword of the
day. Preparation for the offensive
against private capital=the
watchword.

6. “Evolution or tactics?”
 Ustryalov in Smena
Vekh[3]:
more useful than “sweet–
sounding communist lies”.
 

Which side will win? What do
 we lack? Cultured methods,
 ability to administer (including
ability to carry on state trade).

8. Todorsky, p. 62, to
underline.[4]
 Already in Oct. 1918!

(Cf. conqueror and
conquered: who is more
cultured? 4,700
responsible Communists
of Moscow and
Moscow bureaucracy.)

Two typical examples:

9. Example No. 1: Moscow
Consumers’ Co-operative Society fights
the red tape of the People’s
Commissariat for Foreign
Trade.[5]

“Copy of the white
cow.”[6] What did “they” (without
Krasin and Kamenev) lack? Culture.

(Material of the “case”
of the M.C.C.S.
versus the P.C.F.T.)
(In this case there was
insufficient ability to
manage+a certain
political mistake.)
 (Role of the
Communists: they’re bad!)

10. Example No. 2: How “he” (and
“they”) overdid the
administering (in the Donets Basin).

11. “State trusts.” An example ...
 for next year!

12. Summing up: we have quite
enough resources to win in
NEP: both political and
economic. The question is “only”
one of cultured methods!

13. The whiteguards (including the
Mensheviks and S.R.s and Co.)
see in this something in their
favour! Vain hope! A review
of what has been completed
and not completed is very
valuable:
 

(α) A bourgeois-democratic revolution, “they” say! Against
them (400 years’ worth of dung cleaned out in 4 years!).
 (β) Exit from the war: a revolutionary exit from a
reactionary war. And what about them?
 (γ) The Soviet state. The first in the world. A new epoch:
worse than the first locomotive!

The three are inseparable.

The fourth, and main one, is not finished: laying the
foundations of a socialist economy. To be redone again and
again.

14. What “link in the chain” must
we get hold of now?

1917—withdrawal from the war.

1918—Soviet state versus
Constituent Assembly.

1919 and 1920—repelling
invasion.

1921: economic approach to the
peasantry. The search for
an economic policy.

1922: The essential is not in
institutions, not in
reorganisations, not in new decrees,
but in the selection of personnel
and in checking performance.
Selection of personnel and
checking performance.
On three (3) conditions:

(a) Absence of
intervention.
 With Mensheviks and
S.R.s: shooting for
political abetting.

(β) The financial crisis not
to be excessively
severe.
 (Not very severe?
Purging the state trusts.)

(γ) Making no political
mistakes.
 

15. “The key feature of the
moment” (the link in the chain)=
the gap between the grandeur
of the tasks imposed and our
poverty, not only material but
also cultural.

16. We must be at the head of the
masses, otherwise we are a
drop in the ocean.

“The phase of propaganda by
decrees” is over. The masses
will understand and
appreciate only business-like practical
work, practical success in
economic and cultural work.

σσ =Selection of people and
checking of performance!

_ _ _


Additions:

1. The Party versus the Soviet
bodies. (Don’t bother it with petty
jobs. Raise the responsibility of
personnel in Soviet bodies.)

2. All-Russia Central Executive
Committee? Longer sessions.
More careful discussion. More
circumstantial checking.

3. Council of People’s Commissars
and Council of Labour and
Defence.
 My deputies (Rykov and the
usefulness of Wilhelm II).
 Correspondence since Jan. 1922.
Checking performance, pulling
up, purging from above.

4. C.P.C. Raise its prestige, free it
from minor tasks.
 

5. C.L.D. Develop and expand the
activities of the regional
economic conferences.

6. Narrow Council of People’s
Commissars. Free it also from minor
tasks.

Draft directives (on the
instruction of the Central Committee)
will be submitted.

Top Secret

Comrade Kursky, People’s Commissariat for Justice
 Copy to Comrade Krylenko

On my instructions, the former Moscow Extraordinary
Commission began an investigation into the criminal
negligence, red tape and inactivity displayed by the Scientific
and Technical Department and the Inventions Committee.

The results of the investigation were put before the
Moscow Revolutionary Tribunal which, instead of examining
the case in substance, discovering and punishing the guilty
(and that in these institutions there are a sufficient number
of learned wastrels, loafers and other scoundrels, has been
noted more than once in the press, in the articles by
Comrade Sosnovsky and others), adopted an extremely
patronising attitude to the accused, tried them without a
prosecutor, and in the end found the charge not proven and
acquitted all the accused.

At the present time I have been informed that the Moscow
Gubernia Branch of the State Political Department has
appealed against the decision of the Moscow Revolutionary
Tribunal to the Judiciary Supervision Section of the People’s
Commissariat for Justice. I ask you to study this case
personally, pay particular attention to it, try together with
the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection to collect
supplementary material on the activity of these institutions, if
necessary appoint an investigating committee by agreement
with Comrade Avanesov—not composed of officials and
drivellers, but of people who really know how to
investigate properly, to procure the material required and find

    

the culprits. A political trial should be mounted in the
Revolutionary Tribunal (making use of Comrade Sosnovsky
for the press) to really shake up this “scientific” swamp.

I suggest that the Moscow Revolutionary Tribunal be
severely reprimanded for its indulgence and formal
bureaucratic handling of the case.

V. Ulyanov (Lenin)
 Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars

 2) Comrade Steklov
 3) Rykov and Tsyurupa

April 12, 1922

Comrade Osinsky,

I very much welcome your article in today’s Pravda:
“New Data from Local Experience”. It is just such articles
that we need most of all, and I think that every People’s
Commissariat ought to “provide itself” with a publicist
(very closely connected with the work of the People’s
Commissariat and the People’s Commissar) to make such
reviews.

The worst of our features is an excess of general
disquisitions in the press, and political prattle with an extreme
lack of study of local experience. Both in the provinces
and in the centre, powerful tendencies resist its truthful
publicity and truthful evaluation. They are afraid of
washing dirty linen in public, afraid of the naked truth, and
brush it aside with a meaningful glance, taking a
superficial attitude, as Comrade Trotsky correctly said.

We need more and more concreteness in studying local
experience, details, the little things, practice,
businesslike experience, going deeply into real life—uyezd, volost
and village; examination of what, where, by whom and
why (by what means) success is achieved, in spite of the
abyss of poverty and ruin, in reaching genuine
improvement, even if on a small scale, and courage to unmask
mistakes and incapacity, popularising and advertising with
all our strength every local worker who is in any way

    

outstanding, and making him a model. The more such work
is done, the deeper we go into living practice, distracting
the attention of both ourselves and our readers from the
stinking bureaucratic and stinking intellectual Moscow
(and, in general, Soviet bourgeois) atmosphere, the greater
will be our success in improving both our press and all our
constructive work.

Once again I welcome your initiative, and very much
wish that you should continue it further, on a wider scale
and more deeply in the same direction.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

August 21

Svidersky, Reske, Rozmirovich, Ruzer
 and other members of the Collegium of the W.P.I.

I very much regret that Tsyurupa did not manage to
do any work in the Workers’ and Peasants’
Inspection.[1]
I am afraid that the work is not quite rightly organised.
The type of work is individual investigations and reports.
This is old hat. But there is no reorganisation of the
machinery or its improvement. There are no model staffs composed
entirely of Communists, or entirely of students of Schools
of Soviet and Party Work; there are no systematically
worked-out rates of work, which might be applied to other
departments; there are no systematic statistical studies of
what Soviet employees can do in this or that branch of
government in the course of a week, and so forth.

I had constantly hoped that the influx of new people
into the Collegium of the W.P.I. would liven up the work,
but from my questioning of Stalin I have not been able to
see this. Please write to me, and then we shall organise
a meeting, if necessary. You have a staff of 8,000 instead
of 9,000. Would it not be possible to cut it down to 2,000,
with salaries for 6,000 (i.e., to treble the payment) and
improve their qualifications?

If Avanesov arrives soon, show this to him too.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

September 1, 1922

Comrade Avanesov,

Yesterday I talked it over with Comrade Svidersky, and
convinced myself that he too attaches the greatest
importance to the “department of normalisation”. He has given
the jab of collecting the literature to Yermansky. I am
somewhat doubtful whether Yermansky will do this
successfully. He is a Menshevik, and his book shows a certain
maliciousness (although the book is nevertheless a good
one).[1] Please either check up on his performance of the
assignment, or take steps yourself to have it carried out.

Both German and American literature should be obtained.
Everything more or less valuable should be collected,
especially as regards normalising bureaucratic work (procedure
for dispatch of business; forms; control; typing of copies;
inquiries and replies, etc., etc.).

In my opinion, the most necessary thing for us now is
to learn from Europe and America. If I am not mistaken,
I have heard that you have an excellent knowledge of
German. If not, find a translator. Maybe something useful
will be found in the Scandinavian countries also.

Everything must be got together, and don’t rely on
Yermansky without a special check-up.

Maybe through
Krestinsky[2] you will be able to get
hold of some unpublished material? Or through the
ambassador in Norway?

I think that we must work out normalisation, of paper
work, and then apply it everywhere. This is most
important. If they allowed you to look at one of the best
institutions in Germany or Norway, it would be worth
staying over there for a week.
 

The main thing is norms (i.e., how many people for
such-and-such a sum total of work). After that we shall make
our own Central Statistical Board work as well.

Please, after making use of this letter, send it on to A. D.
Tsyurupa. So long as he is ill, I don’t want to worry him.

Best regards,
 Yours,
 Lenin

Comrade Khinchuk,

Please send me the proofs (first proofs, even if
uncorrected) of your new
book.[1]

Would it be possible (provided this does not delay
publication: there should be no delay in any circumstances)
to add tables showing the growth of turnover by quarters,


the number of selling-points in the villages

(and by districts),
 volume of sales in the villages,,
 percentage of expenditure (to turnover),
 number of employees,
 and so forth.

Generally speaking, I think it essential to have precise
data to show how deeply commercial turnover has
penetrated the countryside, how widespread it is, and just how the
process works.

If for some reason it cannot be printed, please send it
to me.

With communist greetings,
 Lenin
 

Notes
 
 



[1]

L. M. Khinchuk’s book Central Union of Consumers’ Societies
in Conditions of the New Economic Policy, referred to by Lenin,
was published by the All-Russia Central Union of Consumers’
Societies in late 1922. The author took account of Lenin’s
remarks and inserted some of them in the final text.

Comrade Khinchuk,

I decided to send you the pamphlet, in order not to
delay it. Please send it to me again in page.

Could you add 

1) Details on reduction of staff? By departments?

2) The same, about normalisation?
 (They say you have a department.)

3) The same, comparing data (all the data) by quarters?

4) The same, showing in how many volosts (and per cent)
and in how many villages (and per cent of all villages)
there are selling-points?

5) Price of tea? Is it not too low? Do you realise that
this is an article of luxury? How do you determine the
allowable maximum price of tea?

6) A division of products into necessities and luxuries.

7) Sales of agricultural implements, including improved
ones? Propaganda measures about them?

With communist greetings,
 Lenin

P.S. The pamphlet is a very good one.

1. Not a reporter, but only a brief introduction to the
debate (illness,
etc.).[3]

2. The theme: has NEP been tested by experience? (The
experience) for or against?

3. The question of “state capitalism” was touched on
already in 1918.

4. Quotation from
pamphlet.[4] Seite5.


[BOX:

“State capitalism would be progress.”

]



5. Quotation: “5 elements” of the economy of Russia.

6. Quotation: which element
predominates?[5]

7. What is the plan or idea or essence of NEP?
 (α) Retention of the land in the hands of the state;
 (β) the same for all commanding heights in the sphere
of means of production (transport, etc.);
 (γ) freedom of trade in the sphere of petty production;
 (δ) state capitalism in the sense of attracting private
capital (both concessions and mixed companies).

8. The result follows: in 1918 retreat was assured.

9. We have been alone for 5 years; there is as yet no
revolution in any other countries; war and hunger. Shall
we perish?

10. To retreat a little. We retreated. Results?

11. Spring of
1921[1]

—to

autumn of 1922. What results?
 

12. The ruble. Its stabilisation


< 3 months 1921
 > 5 months 1922

We are getting back on our feet alone, without help.
(Quadrillion? Yes, but it won’t take long to strike
out.)

13. The peasantry? The tax in kind (successful collection;
hundreds of millions).

14. Light industry? General revival.

15. Heavy industry?
 Very grave situation.
 A turn for the better 1921–22, but very slight.
(Revenue of the State Bank: 20 mln. in gold, possibility
of helping.)

16. Summing up: this means success is possible, there
 is in fact success.
 A system which is not arbitrary, not
muddled, practically tested.
We are getting back on our feet alone,
without outside help.

17. The difficulties are very great and will continue to
be for another few years.
 Mass of stupidities. Yes. Untrodden path.
 No help, on the contrary.
 An alien machinery.

Our stupidities 2x2=5.
“Their” stupidities 2x2=a tallow candle.
 1) Kolchak
 2) Peace of
 Versailles.

}}



18. Therefore
 the prospects are excellent.
 And will be even better if both
 we use the next five-year period mainly
 for study
 and the Communist International,
 since the resolution on organisational structure of
the parties (1921) has not been carried
out.[6]
 Prospects
   ...will be even better.

“on the organisational structure of the
Communist Parties”

“on methods and content of their work ”
Organisatorischer Aufbau der
kommunistischen Parteien, Methoden und
Inhalt ihrer Arbeit.

Speech at Comintern on Nov. 13, 1922
 

Notes
 

[1]
The MS. erroneously says 1911.—Ed.
 



[2]
The plan for Lenin’s report “Five Years of the Russian
Revolution and the Prospects of the World Revolution”, which he
read in German at the morning sitting of the Fourth Congress
of the Comintern on November 13, 1922 (see present edition,
Vol. 33, pp. 418–32).





[3]
Lenin was named the chief rapporteur in the list of speakers on
the question of “Five Years of the Russian Revolution and the
Prospects of the World Revolution”, but in view of his prolonged
illness (from May 26 to October 2, 1922), he was unable to give
a big report on the whole subject, which is why he intended to
make a short introductory speech to the debate on one aspect of
the subject, namely, the question of NEP.





[4]
A reference to the quotation from Lenin’s article “‘Left-Wing’
Childishness and the Petty-Bourgeois Mentality” (see present
edition, Vol. 27, pp. 334–35). He must have taken it from the
pamphlet The Main Task of Our Day; “Left-Wing” Childishness
and the Petty-Bourgeois Mentality (published by the Petrograd
Soviet of Workers’ and Red Army Deputies, 1918, p. 16). A copy
of the pamphlet, with the underlined passages mentioned by
Lenin in the plan of his report and in the report at the Fourth
Congress of the Comintern, is now at the Archives of the Institute
of Marxism-Leninism of the Central Committee of the C.P.S.U.





[5]
See present edition, Vol. 27, p. 336.





[6]
A reference to the resolution “On the Organisational Structure
of the Communist Parties, and on the Methods and Content of
Their Activities”, =

adopted by the Third Congress of the

   

Comintern in 1921. For Lenin’s detailed statement on the resolution,
see present edition, Vol. 33, pp. 430–32.

1. Fifth anniversary (Vladivostok).

2. Civil war united working class and peasantry, and
this is a guarantee of invincible strength.

3. Civil war trained and tempered (Denikin and others
were good teachers; taught seriously; all our best Party
workers were in the army).

3 bis: ... 3 bis: Diplomacy (N.B.). Apparatus is
      easier to build.

]



4. We have overcome last year’s famine too.

5. Now concentrate on economics: how (N.B.) to approach
socialism?

6. Not otherwise than through NEP.

7. A year’s testing?

8. Finances. A small step forward.

9. Kritsman, 1920—16%, 21—50%,
22—60%.[2]

10. Growth of trade, both internal

11.— —and external.

12. —Mixed companies: learning.

13. Industry: light industry has improved, 

14.— — — heavy difficult, but not hopeless: there is
a small step forward.

15. Central Council of Co-operative Societies: its special
significance.

16. The state apparatus in general: bad beyond
description; lower than the bourgeois level of culture.

(“frightened” in November 1917); it is a question of
culture in general, and it will take years to raise it.
 

17. Hundreds of thousands of employees in the state
 apparatus. Increase.

N.B.

18. Census of 1922 (Oct.–Nov.).

19. Its results.

20. Article by
Kin.[3]

21. Not alterations, but redistribution and reduction.

22. A job for many years: (we are alone, it is we who are
carrying, and we should be the ones who are being carried).

23. More rapidly (1917–22)
 more slowly (1922–27?) (“watchword”).

24. Patronage of town Party cells over village cells and
vice versa.

Often: this apparatus does not belong to us, we belong
to it!

Supply of raw materials and other things for the next
year! N.B. (danger).
 

Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin wrote the outline of his proposed speech at the Tenth
All-Russia Congress of Soviets in the first half of December 1922.
On the matter of the speech Lenin wrote to J. V. Stalin for
members of the Central Committee on December 15 (see present edition,
Vol. 33, p. 460). But because of his poor health, Lenin was unable
to speak at the Congress.





[2]
The data given by Lenin are a reflection of the lag of prices behind
the money circulation between June and November 1920 (by
16 per cent), 1921 (50 per cent) and 1922 (60 per cent). This
was evidence of the stabilisation of the ruble and apparently
served to confirm Point 8 of the outline “Finance. Small Step
Forward ”.

Lenin must have taken the data from L. N. Kritsman’s
introduction to a collection entitled, Along New Paths. The Results
of the New Economic Policy for 1921 and 1922 (Issue II, Finance.
Works Edited by a Commission of the Council of Labour and
Defence, Moscow, C.L.D. Publication, 1923). On December 10, 1922,
during his preparations for the speech, Lenin asked for the proofs
of the collection.





[3]
A possible reference to the article by F. Kin, “Specialists (A
Statistical Survey)”, published in Pravda No. 197 on September 3,
1922. On the strength of a poll of 230 engineers working in Soviet
administrative bodies and trusts the author drew the conclusion
that there were two kinds of specialists: those hostile to the Soviet
power, and others who were steadily being drawn into co-operation
with it. The author maintained that one of the tasks of the Soviet
power was to promote this differentiation of bourgeois specialists
in every way.

      "Last Testament"
      Letters to the Congress
    


Written: December 1922 - January 1923
      
First Published: 1956 in
      Kommunist (No. 9)

      
Source: Lenin Collected Works, Volume
      36 (p. 593-611)

      Contents:
    

Letter to the Congress

Granting Legislative Functions to the State
      Planning Commission

The Question of Nationalities or
      "Autonomisation"



      These letters, and those that follow (See Lenin's Last
      Works subject index), make up the last of Lenin's
      works which are equivalent to an outline programme for the
      future of the Soviet government. 
    

      In these letters Lenin emphasises the need to make changes to
      the Soviet government and warns of potentially disastrous
      consequences if the necessary but difficult steps are not
      taken. These works offer Lenin's early and incredibly insightful
      critique of the Soviet government, and critique some of its
      members, Stalin in particular. The present work was not
      published until 1956, repressed by Stalin until his death, first
      published three decades after they were written.
    

      Printed from the short hand notes.
    

      See Lenin's
      Last Testament in the Encyclopedia of Marxism for a more
      thorough historical overview of the document.
