The imperialist war has greatly accelerated and intensified the process of transformation of monopoly capitalism into state­ monopoly capitalism.
** The monstrous oppression of the masses of the toilers by the state-which is becoming merged more and more with the ail-powerful capitalist combines-is becoming ever more monstrous.
The advanced countries, are being converted­ we speak here of their "rear"-into military convict prisons for the workers.
The unprecedented horrors and miseries of the protracted war are making the position of the masses unbearable and are causing their anger to grow.
An international· proletarian revolution is clearly maturing.
The question of its relation to the state is ac­ quiring practjcal importance.
The elements of opportunism accumulated during the decades of comparatively peaceful development caused the predomillance of social-chauvinism in the official Socialist Parties throughout the· world.
This trend of socialism in words and' chauvinism m deeds (Plekhanov, Potresov, Breshkovskaya, Rubanovich, and in a slightly concealed form, Messrs.
Tseretelli, Cherriov and Co.

) is distinguished for tlte base, servile adaptation of the "leaders" of "socialism" to the interests not only of "their" national bourgeoisie, but also of "their" state-for the majority of the so-called Great Powers have long been exploiting and enslaving a number of small and weak nationalities.
The illlperialist war is precisely a war for the division and re-devision gf this kind of booty, The struggle for 5 ---------of the bourgeoisie in general, and of the imperialist bourgeoisie in particular, is impossible without a struggle against opportunist prejudices about the "state.
" First of all we examine Marx's and Engels' doetrine of the state and deal in particular detail with those aspects of their doctrine which have been forgotten or have been opportunistically distorted.
Then we analyse separately the chief representative of these distortions, Karl Kautsky, the best-known leader of the Second International (1889-1914), which has suffered such miser­ able bankruptcy in the present war.
Finally, we sum up, in th~ main, the experiences of the Russian Revolution of 1905 and par­ ticularly of that of 1917.
Apparently, the latter is now (middle of August 1917) completing the first stage of its developm~nt; but, generally speaking, thi_s revolution as.
a whole can only be regar~ed as a link in the chain of socialist proletarian revolutio~s called forth by the imperialist war.
Hence, the question of the relation of the socialist proletarian revolution to the state acquires, not only practical political importance, but the importance of an urgent problem of the day, the problem of explaining to the masses what they will have to do to emancipate themselves from the yoke of capitalism in the very nea:i: future.

TEE AUTHOR Nfoscow1 December 30, 1918 CHAPTER I CLASS SOCIETY AND THE STATE 1.
THE STATE AS THE PRODUCT OF THE IRRECONCILABILITY OF CLASS ANTAGONISMS WHAT is now happening to Marx's doctrine has, in the 'course of history, often happened to the doctrines of other revolutionary thinkers and leaders of oppressed classes struggling for emanci­ pation.
During the lifetime of great revolutionaries, the oppressing classes relentlessly persecute them, and treat their teachings with malicious hostility, the most furious hatred and the most unscru­ pulous campaign of lies and slanders.
After their death, attempts are made to convert them into harmless icons, to canonise them, so to say, and to surround their names with a certain halo for the "consolation" of the oppressed classes and with the object of duping them, while at the same time emasculating the revolution­ ary doetrine of its content, vulgarising it and blunting its revolu­ tionary edge.
At the present time, the bourgeoisie and the opportun­ ists in the labour movement concur in this "revision" of Marxism.
· They omit, obliterate and distort the revolutionary side of its doc­ trine, its revolutionary soul.
They push to the foreground and extol what is or seems acceptable to the bourgeoisie.
All the social­ .
chauvinists are now "Marxists" (don't laugh!) .
And more and more frequently, German bourgeois professors, erstwhile specialists in the extermination of.
Marxism, are speaking of the "national~ German" Marx, who, they aver, trained the labour unions which are -so splendidly organised for the purpose of conducting a predatory war! .
.
.
_ -In such circumst&nces, in-view of the~ incredibly widespread nature of the distortions of Marxism, our first task is to restore the true doctrine of :~for~ op.
the state.
For this purpose it will 7 [i: I I I course, long quotations will make the text cumbersome and will .
not help to make it popular reading, but we cannot possibly avoid them.
All, or at any rate, all the most essential passages in the works of Marx and Engels on the subject of the state must necessarily be given as fully as possible, in order that the reader may form an independent opinion on the totality of views 'of the founders of scientific socialism and on the development of those views, and in order that their distortion by the now prevailing "Kautskyism" may be documentarily proved and clearly demon­ strated.
Let us begin with the most popular of Engels' works, Der Ursprung der Familie, des Privateigentums und des Staates, the sixth edition of which was published in Stuttgart as far back as 1894.
We must translate the quotations from the German originals, as the Russian translations, although very numerous, are for the most part either incomplete or very unsatisfactory.
Summing up his historical analysis, Engels says: "The state is therefore by no means a power imposed on society from the outside; just as little is it 'the reality of the moral idea,' 'the image and reality of reason,' as Hegel asserts.
* Rather, it is a product of society at a certain stage of development; it is the admission that this society has become entan.
,.
led in an insoluble contradiction with itself, that it is cleft into irreconcilable"' antag­ onisms, which it is p(.
werless to dispel.
But in order that these antagonisms classes with conflicting economic interests, might not consume themselves and society in sterile struggle, a power apparently standing above society became necessary for the purpose of moderating the conflict and keeping it within the bounds.
of 'order'; and this power, arising out of society, but placing itself above It, and increasingly alienating itself from it, is the st_ate.
" 1 This fully expresses the basic idea of Marxism on the question of the historical role and meaning of the state.
The state is the product and the manifestation of the irreconcilability of class antagonisms.
The state arises when, where and to the extent that class· antagonisms cannot be objectively reconciled: And, ·con­ versely, the existence of the state proves that the class antagon­ isms are irreconcilable.

· · · · ·· -that distortions of Marxism, proceeding along two main lines, begin.
.
On the one hand, the bourgeois ideologists, and particularly the petty-bourgeois ideologists, compelled by the pressure of in­ disputable historical facts to admit that the state only ex~sts where there are class antag~misms and the class struggle, "~orrect" Marx in a way that makes it appear that the state is an organ for the conciliation of classes.
According to Marx, the state could neither arise nor continue to exist if it were possible to conciliate classes.
According to the petty-bourgeois and philistine professors and publicists-frequently on the strength of weH-mea~ing references to Marx!-the state conciliates classes.
According to Marx, the state is an organ of class rule, an organ for the oppression of one class by another; it creates "order," which legalises and perpetuates this oppression by moderating the collisions between the classes.
In the opinion of the petty-bourgeois politicians, order means· the conciliation of classes, and not the oppression of one class by :mother; to.
moderate collisions means conciliating and not depriving the oppressed classes of definite means ·and methods of fighting to overthrow the oppressors.
For instance, when, in the Revolution of 1917, the question of the real meaning and role of ihe state arose in all its magnitude as a practical ·question demanding immediate action on a wide mass scale, all the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks im­ mediately and completely sank to the petty-bourgeois theory that the "state" "conciliates" classes.
Innumerable resolutions and arti­ cles by politicians of both these parties are thoroughly saturated with this purely petty-bourgeois and philistine· "conciliation" theory.
Petty-bourgeois demoeracy is never able to understand that the state is the organ .
.
of the rule of a definite.
class which cannot be reconciled with its-antipode (the class opposite to it).
Their attitude towards the state .
.
is one of the most striking proofs that our Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks are not socialists at all (which we BoJsheviks.
have always maintained),-but petty­ bourgeois democrats with near-Socialist phraseology.
On the other hand, the "Kautskyan" distorti-0n:of_MarxiSrtds far organ ~f.
~!ass :rule, or that class antagoni~ms are irreconcilable.
But what is lost sight of or glossed over is this: if the state is the product.
of irreconcilable class antagonisms, if it is a power standing a6ove society and "increasingly alienating itself from it," it is clear that the liberation of the oppressed class is impossible, not only without a violent revolution, but also without the de­ struction of the apparatus of state power which was created by the ruling class and which is the embodiment of this "~lienation.
" A~ we shall see later, Marx very definitely drew this theoretically self-evident conclusion from a concrete historical analysis of the tasks of the revolution.
And-as we shall show fully .
in our sub­ sequent remarks~it is precisely this conclusion which Kautsky has "forgotten" and distorted.
· 2.
SPECIAL BODIES OF ARMED MEN, PRISONS, ETC.
.
Engels continues: "As against the ancient gentile organisation, the primary distinguishing feature of the state is the division of the subjects of the state according to territory.
" .
Such a division seems "natural" to us, but it cost a prolonged struggle against the old form of tribal or gentile society.
" .
•.
The second is the es~ablishment of a public power, which is no longer directly identical with· the population organising itself as an armed power.
This special public _power is necessary, because a self-acting armed organisa­ tion of the population has become impossible since the cleavage into classes .
.
.
.
This public power exists in every state; it consists not merely of armed men, but of material appendages, prisons and coercive institutions of all kinds, of which gentile society knew nothing .
.
.
.
" 1 · Engels further elucidates the .
concept of the "power" which is termed the state-a power which arises from society, but which plates itself above it and becomes more and more alienated from it.
What does this power mainly consist of? It consists of special bodies -of 'armed' men which have prisons, etc.
, at their disposal.

g~l~ tried to draw the attention of the class conscious workers to the very fact which prevailing philistinism regards as least worthy of attention, as • the most common and sanctified, not only by long stan,ding, but one might say by petrified prejudices.
A standing army and police are the chief instruments of state power.
But can it be otherwise? From the point of view of the vast majority of Europeans of the end of the nineteenth century whom Engels ~as.
addressing, and who have not lived through or closely observed a s,ingle great revolution, it cannot be otherwise.
They completely .
fail· to under­ stand what ·a "self-acting armed organisation .
of the population" is.
To the question, whence arose the need for special bodies of armed men, standing above society and becoming alienated from it (police and standing army), the West European and Russian philistines are inclined to answer with a few phrases borrowed from Spencer or Mikhailovsky, by referring to the complexity of social life, the differentiation of functions, and so forth.
Such a reference seems "scientific"; it effectively dulls the senses of the average man and obscures the most important and basic fact, namely, the cleavage ot society into irreconcilably antagonistic classes.
Had this cleavage not existed, the "self­ acting armed organisation of.
the population" might have ·differed from the primitive organisation of a tribe of monkeys grasping sticks, or of primitive man, or of men united in a tribal form of society, by its complexity, its high technique, and so forth; but it would still have been possible.
.
It is imp-0ssible now, because civilised society is divided into antagonistic and, indeed, irreconcilably antagonistic classes, the "self-acting" arming of which would lead to an al-med struggle between them.
A state arises, a special force is created in the form of special bodies of armed men, and every revolution,l by ~estroying the state apparatus,2 demo~strates to us how the ruling 1 The original manuscript ·read: "great revolution.

.
·· -and how the oppressed class strives to create a new organisation of this kind, capable of serving not the exploiters but the exploited.
.
In the above argument, Engels raise5 theoretically the very question which every great revolution raises practically, palpably "" and on a mass scale of action, namely, the question of the relation between special bodies of armed men and the "self-acting armed organisation of the population.
" We shall see how this is con­ cretely illustrated by the experience of the European and Russian revolutions.
But let us return to Engels' exposition.
He points out that sometimes, in certain parts of North Amer­ ica, for example, this public power is weak (he has in mind a rare exception in capitalist society, and parts of North America in its pre-imperialist days where the free colonist predominated), but that in general it grows stronger: "It [the public power] grows stronger, however, in proportion as the class antagonisms within the state become more acute, and with the growth in size and population of the adjacent states.
We have only to look at our present-day Europe, where class struggle and rivalry in conquest have ecrewed up the public power to such a pitch that it threatens to devour the whole of society and even the state itself.
" 1 This was written rto later than the beginning of the nineties of the last century, Engels' last preface being dated June 16, 1891.
The turn towards imperialism~meaning by that the complete domination of the trusts, the omnipotence of the big banks, a colonial policy on a grand scale, and so forth-was only just beginning in France, and was even weaker in North America and in Germany.
Si:n:ce then "rivalry in conquest" has made gigantic stride&--especially as, by the beginning of the second decade of the twentieth century, the whole world had been finally divided up among these "rivals in conquest,'.
' i.
e.
, among the great pre­ datory powers.

complete catastrophe.
As· early as 1891 Engels was able to point to "rivalry in con­ quest" as one of the most important distinguishing features of the foreign policy of the Great Powers, but in 1914-i7, when this rivalry, many times intensified, has given birth to an imperialist war, the rascally social-chauvinists cover up their defence of the predatory interests of "their" bourgeoisie by phrases about "de' fence of the fatherland," "defence of the republic and the revolu­ tion," etc.
! 3.
THE STATE AS.
AN INSTRUMENT FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF THE OPPRESSED Cuss For the maintenance of a special public power standing above society, taxes and state loans are needed.
" .
.
.
Possessing the public power and the right to exact taxes, the officials now exist as organs of society standing above society.
·The free voluntary respect which was accorded to the organs of the gentile organisatio~ does not satisfy them, even if they could have it.
" 1 Special laws are enacted proclaiming the sanctity and immun' ity of the .
officials.
"The shabbiest police servant" has more "authority" than all the representatives of the tribe put together,.
but even the head of the military power of a civilised state may well envy a tribal chief the "unfeigned and undisputed respect" the latter enjoys.
Here the question of the privileged position of the officials as organs of state power is stated.
·The main point indicated is: what puts them above society? We shall see how this theoretical problem was solved in practice by the Paris Commune in 1871 and how it was slurred over in a reactionary manner by Kautsky in 1912.
·.
"As the state arose out of the need to hold class antagonisms in check, but as it, at the same time, arose in the midst of the conflict of these classes, it is,.
as a rule, the state of the most powerful, economically dominant class which through the m.
edium of the state became also the dominant class politically, and thus acqmred new means of holding down and exploiting the oppressed class .

" : Such, for -instance, ~ere the abs-0lute monarchies of the seven­ teenth and eighteenth centuries,* the Bonapartism of the First and Second Empires in_ France, and the Bismarck regime in· Germany.
Such, we add, is the present Kerensky government in republican Russia since it began to persecute the revolutionary proletariat, at a moment when; thanks.
to the leadership of the petty-bour­ geois democrats, the Soviets have already become impotent while the _bourgeoisie is not yet strong enough openly t_o -disperse them.
· ---In a democratic republic, Engels continues, "wealth wields its power indirectly, but all the mo.
re effectively," first, by means of the "direct corruption of the officials" (America); second, by means of "the alliance between the government and the Stock Exchange" (France and America) .
At the present time, imperialism and the domination of the banks have "developed" both these methods of defending and asserting the omnipotence of wealth in democratic republics of all descriptions to an unusually fine art.
For instance, in the very first months of the Russian democratic republic,· orie might say during the honeymoon of the union of the "Socialist" S.
R.
's and the Mensheviks with the bourgeoisie, Mr.
Palchinsky, in the co­ alition government, obstructed every measure intended for the pur­ pose of restraining the capitalists and their marauding practices, their plundering of the public treasury by means of war contracts.
When Mr .
.
.
Palchinsky resigned (and, of course, was replaced by a.
n exactly similar Palchinsky ), the capitalists "rewarded" him with a "soft" job and a salary of 120,000 rubles per annum.
What would you -c_all ·thi&-'-direct or indirect corruption? -An alliance betWeen the government a.
!!d the syndicates, or "only" friendly relations? What role do the Chernovs, Tsereteliis, Avksentyevs and The omnipotence of "wealth" is thu:s more secure in a demo­ cratic republic,· since it does not dependl on the faulty political shell of capitalism.
A democratic rep.
ublic is the best possible political shell for capitalism, and, therefore, once capital has gained control of this very best shell {through the Palchinskys, Chernovs, Tseretellis and Co.
), it establishes its power so securely, so firmly, that no change, either of persons, of institutions, or of parties in the bourgeois-democratic republic, can shake it.
We must also note that Engels' very definitely-ca:lls universal suffrage an instrument· of bourgeois rule.
· Universal suffrage, he says, obviously suniming up the long experience of German Social: Democracy, is " .
.
.
an index of the maturity of the working class.
It c'annot and never will be anything more in the modern state:"· --· · · · -· The petty-bourgeois democrats, such as our Socialist-Revolu­ tionaries and Mensheviks, and also their twin brothers, the social­ chauvinists and opportunists of Western Europe, all expect "~ore" from universal suffrage.
They themselves share and instil into the minds of the people the wrong idea that universal suffrage "in the modern state" is really capable of expressing the will of the majority of the toilers and of ensuring its realisation.
· Here we can only note this wrong idea, only point out that Engels' perfectly clear, precise and concrete statement is disforted at every step in the propaganda and agitation conducted by the.
"official" (i.
e.
, opportunist) Socialist Parties.
A detailed elucida­ tion of the utter falsity of this idea, which Engels brushes aside is given in our further account of the views of Marx and .
Engel~ on the -"modern" state.
.
.
.
Engels gives a general summary of his views in the most popular of his works in the following words: · --.
"'J'.
he sta_te, therefore, has not· existed from all eternity.
There have been societies which manage~ without it, which had no conception of the state and state power.
At a certam Stage of economic development, which was necessar' 1 Th_e or!.

They will fall as inevitably as they ai:ose at an earlier stage.
Along with them, the state will inevitably fall; The society that organises production anew on the basis of the free and equal association of the producers will ·put the whole state machine where it will then belong.
: in the museum of ant,iquities, side by side with the· spinning wheel and the bronze axe.
" 1 ' We do not often come across this passage in the propaganda and agitation literature of present-day SocialcDemocracy.
But even when we do come across it, it is.
generally quoted in the same manner as one bows before an icon, i.
e.
, it is done merely to show official respect for Engels, and no attempt is made to gauge the breadth and depth of the_ revolution that this relegating of "the whole state machine .
.
.
to the museum of antiquities" pre­ supposes.
In most cases we do not even find an understanding of what Engels calls the state machine.
4.
THE "WITHERING AWAY" OF THE STATE AND VIOLENT REVOLUTION Engels' words regarding the "withering away" of the state are so widely known, they are so often quoted, and they reveal the significance of the customary painting of Marxism to look like opportunism so clearly that we must deal with them in detail.
We shall quote the whole passage from which they are taken.
"The proletariat seizes the state power and transforms the means of pro­ duction in the first instance into state property.
But in doing this, it puts an end to itself as the proletariat, it puts an end to all class differences and class antagonisms, it puts an end also to the state as the state.
Former society, moving in class antagonisms, had need of the state, that is, an organisation of the exploiting class, at each period for the maintenance of its external condi· tions of production; that .
is; therefore, for the forcible holding down of the exploited class in the conditions o·f oppression (slavery, villeinage or serfdom, wage-labour) determined by the existing mode of production.
The state was the official representative of society as a whole, its embodiment in a visible corporation; but it was this only in so far as it was the state of that class which itself, in its epoch, nipresented society as a whole: in ancient times, the state of the slave-owning citizens; in the Middle Ages, of the feudal nobility; 1 lbid.

briefly express the experience of one of the great proletarian revolutions, the.
Paris Commur{e of 1871, of which we shall speak in greater detail in its proper place.
As a matter of fact, Engels speaks here of the _"abolition" of the bourgeois sta;te by the proletarian revolu­ tion, while the words about its withering away refer to the remnants 'of the proletarian state after the socialist revolution.
According to Engels the bourgeois state does not "wither away," but is "put on end to" by the proletariat in the course of the revolution.
What withers away after the revolution is the proletarian state or semi-state.
Secondly, the state is a "special repressive force.
" Engels gives this splendid and extremely profound definition here with com· plete lucidity.
And from it follows that the "special repressive force" for the suppression of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie, 'for the _suppression of the millions· of toilers by a handful of L1.
e rich; must be superseded by a "special repress-ive force" for the suppression of the bourgeoisie by the proletariat (the dictatorshi.
p of the proletariat).
This is precisely what is meant by putting an end to "the state as the state.
" This is precisely the "act" of taking possession of the means of production in the name of society.
And it is obvious that such a substitution of one (proletarian) "special repressive force" for another (bourgeois) "special re­ pressivt'.
force" cannot possibly take plaice in the form of "with-ering away.
" Thirdly, in regard to the state "withering away," and the even _more expressive and colourful "ceasing_ of itself," Engels refers quite clearly and definitely to the period after the state has "taken pqssession of the means of production in the name of society," that is, after the socialist revolution.
We all know that the political form, of the "s~ate" at that time is the most complete democracy.
But it ;never enters the head of any of the opportunists who shame· lessly distort Marxism that Engels here speaks of democracy _''withering· away," or ".
ceasing of itself.
" This seems very strange at first sight; but it is "unintelligible" only to those who have not pondered over the fact that democracy is also a state and that, .
c-o:ns·equerttly, democracy_will also disappear when the state disap· pears.

Eclecticism is substituted for .
dialectics-this is the most usual; the most widespread phenomenon to be met with in present-day official Social-Democratic literature on Marxism.
This sort of substitution is not new, of course, it is observed even in the his· tory of classic Greek philosophy.
In painting Marxism to look like opportunism, the substitution of eclecticism for dialectics is_ the best method of deceiving the masses; it gives ari illusory satisfaction; it seems to take into account all sides of the process, all tendencies of development, all the conflicting influences, and so forth, whereas in reality it presents no consistent and revolutionary conception of the process of social development at all.
We have already said above, and shall show more fully later, that the doctrine of Marx and Engels concerning_ the inevitability of a violent revolution refers to the bourgeois state.
The latter cannot be superseded by the proletarian state (the dictatorship of the proletariat) in the process of "withering away"; as a general rule, this can happen only by means of a violent revolution.
The panegyric Engels sang in its honour, and which fully corresponds to Marx's repeated declarations (recall the concluding pas­ sages of The Poverty of Philosophy and The Communist Mani­ festo, with their proud and open declaration of the inevitability of a violent revolution; recall Marx's Critiqne of the Gotha Programme of 1875, in which, almost thirty years later, he merci­ lessly castigates the opportunist character of that programme)­ this panegyric is by no means a mere "impulse," a mere declam­ ation or a polemical sally.
The necessity of systematically imbuing the masses with this and precisely this view of violent revolu­ tion lies at the root of the whole of Marx's and Engels' doctrine.
The betrayal of their doctrine by the now predominant social­ chauvinist and Kautskyan trends is brought out in striking relief by the neglect of such propaganda and agitation by both these trends.
The substitution of the proletarian state for the bourgeois .
state is impossible without a violent revolution.
The abolition of the -----------through the process of "withering away.

Marx and Engels fully and concretely enlarged o~ these v1~ws in studying each revolutionary situatio~ s~p~raitely, in a:ialysmg the lessons of the experience of each rnd1v1dual revol~t10n.
We shall now proceed to discuss this, undoubtedly the most important part of their doctrine.
CHAPTER II THE STATE AND REVOLUTION.
THE EXPERIENCE OF 1848-51 1.
THE EvE OF THE R:EvoLUTION· THE first works of mature Marxism-The Poverty of Philosophy and The Communist Manifesio-appeared on the eve of the Rev­ olution of 1848.
For this reason, in addition to presenting the general principles of Marxism, they reflect to.
a certain degree the concrete revolutionary situation of the time.
Hence, it will be more expedient, perhaps, to examine what the authors of these works said about the state immediately before they drew conclu­ sions from the experience of the years 1848-51.
In The Poverty of Philosophy Marx wrote: "The working· class in the course uf its development will substitute for the old civil society an association which will exclude classes and their antagon­ ism, and there will be no more political power properly so-called, since political power is pr;ecisely the offidal expression of antagonism in civil society.
" 1 <It is instructive to compare this general statement of the idea of the state disappearing after classes have b'een abolished with the statement contained in The Communist Manifesto, written by Marx and Engels .
a few months later-to be exact, in November 1847: "In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing sodety, up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where.
the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the ·sway of the proletm'iat •.

b d all "The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, Y ~gre:s, capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all i17struments of J?roductio~ m the hands of the state, i.
e.
, of the proletariat orgamsed as the :uh~~ 1 class, and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible.
Here we have a formulation of one of the most remarkable and most important ideas of Marxism on the subject of the state, nameiy, the idea of the "dictatorship of the proletariat" (as M'.
11"x and Engels began to call it after the Paris Commune) ; and also a very interesting definition of the ·state whic~ also" belongs ~.
o ~he category of the "forgotten words" of Marxism: the state, i.
e.
, "the proletariat organised as the ruling class.
" .
This definiti~n of the state has never been explained in the prevailing propaganda and agitation liter.
ature of the· official "ocial-Democratic Parties.
More than that, it has been forgotten, for it is absolutely irreconcilable with reformism, and is a slap in the face of the common op-portunist prejudices and philistine illusions about the "peaceful development of democracy.
" The proletariat needs the state--this is .
repeated by all the opportunists social-chauvinists and Kautsky1sts, who assure us that this is ~hat Marx taught.
But they "forget" to add that, in the first place, according to Marx, the proletariat.
needs onl! a state which is withering away, i.
e.
, a state so constituted that it begins to wither away immediately, and cannot but wither away.
Secondly, the toilers need a "state," i.
e.
, "the proletariat organised as the ruling class.
" The state is a special organisation of force; it is the organ-isation of violence for the suppression of some class.
What class must the proletariat suppress? Naturally, only the exploiting class i.
e.
, the bourgeoisie.
The toilers need a state only to over­ com: the resistance of the exploiters, and only the proletariat can direct this suppression, carry it out; for the proletariat is the on.
ly class 'that is consistently revolutionary, the only class that can umte all the toilers and the exploited in the struggle against_ the hour· o-eoisie, in completely cdisplaeing it.

I minor· jty and against the interests of the vast majority of the people.
The exploited classes need political rule in order completely to abolish all exploitation, i.
e.
, in the interests of the vast majority cf the people, and against the interests of the insignificant minor· ity consisting of the modern slave-owners-the landlords and the capitalists.
The petty-bourgeois democrats, those alleged Socialists who substituted dreams of class harmony for .
the class struggle, even pictured ·the socialist reformation in a dreaniy fashion-not in the form of the overthrow of the rule of the exploiting class, but in the form of the peaceful submission of the minority to the majority which has become conscious of its ailllS.
This petty· bourgeois utopia, which is inseparably bound up with the idea of the state being above classes, led in practice to the betrayal of the interests of the toiling classes, as was shown, for example, by the history of the French revolutions of 1848 and 1871, * and by the "Socialists" joining bourgeois cabinets in England, France, Italy and other countries at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries.
** Marx fought all his life against this petty-bourgeois socialism­ now resurrected in Russia by the Socialist-Revolutionary and Men­ shevik Parties.
He logically pursued his doctrine of the class struggle to the doctrine of political power, the doctrine of the state.
The overthrow of bourgeois rule can be accomplished only by the proletariat, as the particular class whose economic conditions of existence train it for this task and provide it with the oppor­ tunity and the power to perform it.
While the bourgeoisie breaks up and disintegrates the peasantry and all the petty-bourgeois strata, it welds together, unites and organises the proletariat.
Only the proletariat-by virtue of the economic role it plays in large­ $Cale production~is capable of acting as the leader of all the toiling and exploited masses, whom the bourgeoisie exploits, oppresses and crushes not less, and often more, than.
it does the proletarians, but who are incapable of waging · an independent struggle for their emancipation.
q11e;ition of the state.
and of the socialist revolution, leads inevit­ C!bly to the recognition of the political rule of the proletariat, of its di.
ctaforship, i.
e.
, of power shared with none and relying directly upon the armed force of the· masses.
The overthrow of the bour­ geoisie can be achieved only by the proletariat becoming trans· formed into the ruling class;, capable of crushing the inevitable and desperate resistance of the bourgeoisie, and of organising all the toiling and exploited masses for the new economic order.
The proletariat needs state power, the centralised organisation of force, the organisation of violence, for the purpose of crushing the resistance of the exploiters and for the purpose of leading the great mq.
ss.
of the population--=the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie; the semi-proletarians-in the work of organising socialist economy.
By educating the workers' party, Marxism educates the van­ guard of the proletariat which is capable of assuming power and of· leading the whole people to socialism, of directing and organ­ ising the·new order, of being the teacher, guide and leader of all the toiling and exploited in the task of building up their social life without the bourgeoisie and against the bourgeoisie.
As against this, the now prevailing opportunism breeds in' the ranks of· the workers' party representatives of the better paid workers, who lose touch with the rank and file, "get along" fairly well under capital­ ism, and sell their birthright for a mess of pottage, i.
e.
, renounce their role of revolutionary leaders of the people against the bom· geoisie.
Marx's theory: "The state, i.
e.
, the proletariat organised as the ruling class," is inseparably bound up with all he taught on the revolutionary role of the proletariat in history.
The culmination of this role is the proletarian dictatorship, the political rule of the proletariat.
Brit if the proletariat needs a state as a special form of organ­ isation of violence against the bourgeoisie, the following deduction automatically arises:' is it conceivable that such an organisation· can be created without first abolishing, destroying the state machine (treated by 'the bourgeoisie for it$elf?

THE REVOLUTION.
SUMMED UP Marx sums up the Revolution of 1848-51, in connection with the question of the state we are concerned with, in the following pass• age in The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte: .
" .
.
.
But the revolution is thoroughgoing.
It is still in process of passing through purgatory.
It does its work methodically.
By December 2, 1851 [the day of Louis Bonaparte's coup d'etat],* it had completed one-half of its pre­ paratory work; it is .
now completing the other half.
First it perfected the parliamentary power, in order ti:J be able to overthrow it.
Now that it has attained this, it perfects the executive power, reduces it to its purest ex­ pression, isolates it, sets it up ag_ainst itself as the sole target, in order to concentrate all its forces of destruction against it [italics ours].
And when it has done this second half of its preliminary work, Europe will leap from her seat and exultantly exclaim: well grubbed, old mole! ·"This executive power v.
-ith its monstrous bureaucratic arid military organ­ isation, with its artificial state machinery embracing wide strata, with a host of.

Napoleon ·perfected this state machinery.
" The legitimist monarchy and the July monarchy** "added nothing but a greater division of labour .
.
.
.
" "The parliamentary republic finally, in its struggle against the revolution found itself compelled to strengthen, along with the repressive measures, th~ resources and centralisation of governmental power.
All the re.
volutions per­ fected this machine, instead of smashing it up [italics ours].
The parties that contended in turn for domination regarded the possession of this huge state edifice as the principal opoils of the victor.
" 1 In this remarkable passage Marxism takes a tremendous step forward compared with The Communist Manifes,to.
In the latter, the question of the state i1' still treated in an extremely abstract manner, in the most general terms and expressions.
In the above­ quoted passage, the question is treated in a concrete manner, and the.
conclusion is most precise, d_efinite, practical and palpable: .

' .
.

VIL--1\d.
Eng.
ed, all the revolutions which have occurred up to now have helped to perfect the state machine, whereas it must be smashed, broken.
This conclusion is the chief and fundamental thesis in the l\Iarxian doctrine of· the state.
And it is precisely this fondamental thesis which has been not only completely forgotten by the pre· dominant official Social-Democratic Parties, but positively dis­ torted (as we shall see later) by the foremost theoretician of the Second International, K.
Kautsky.
The Communist Manifesto gives a general summary of history, which compels us to regard the state as the organ of class rule and leads us to the inevitable conclusion that the proletariat can­ not overthrow the bourgeoisie "ithout first capturing political power, without attaining political supremacy, without trans­ forming the state into the "proletariat organised as the ruling class"; it inevitably leads to the conclusion that this proletarian state will begin to wither away immediately after its victory, be· cause the state is unnecessary and cannot exist in a society in which there are no class antagonisms.
The question as to how, from the point of view of historical development, the substitution of the proletarian state for the bourgeois state is to take place is not raised.
Marx raises this question and answers it in 1852.
1 True to his philosophy of dialectical materialism, Marx takes as his basis the experience of the great years of revolution, 1848 to 1851.
Here, as everywhere, his teaching is the summary of experience, illumin· ated by a profound philosophical conception of the world and a rich knowledge of history.
The problem of the state is put concretely: how did the bour­ geois state, the state machine necessary for the rule of the bour­ geoisie, come into being historically? What changes did it under­ go, what evolution did it undergo in the course of the bourgeois· revolutions and in the face of the independent actions of the op­ pressed classes? What are the tasks of the proletariat in relation to this state machine? The centralised state power that is peculiar to bourgeois society 1 I.

stitutions are most characteristic of this state machine: bureaucracy and a standing army.
In their works, Marx and Engels repeatedly mention the thousand threads which connect these institutions with the bourgeoisie.
The experience of every worker illustrates this connection in an extremely striking and impressive manner.
From its own bitter experience, the working class learns.
to recognise this connection; that is why it learns so quickly and why it so completely assimilates the doctrine which reveals this inevitable connection, a doctrine which the petty-bourgeois democrats either ignorantly and light-heartedly deny, or, still more light-heartedly, admit "in general," forgetting to draw the corresponding practical conclusions.
The bureaucracy and the standing army are a "parasite".
on the body of bourgeois society-a parasite created by the inherent antagonisms which rend that society, but a p.
arasite which "chokes all its pores" of life.
The Kautskyan opportunism now prevalent in official Social-Democracy considers the view that the state is a parasitic growth to be the peculiar and exclusive attribute of -anarchism.
Naturally, this distortion of Marxism is extremely useful to those philistines who have so utterly disgraced socialism by justifying and embellishing the imperialist war with the term "national defence"; but it is an absolute distortion nevertheless.
The development, perfection and strengthening of the bureau­ cratic and _military apparatus proceede~ during all the numerous bourgeois revolutions which Europe has witnessed since the fall of feudalism.
It is precisely the petty bourgeoisie that is attracted to the side of the big bourgeoisie and is subordinated to it to a large extent by means of this apparatus, which provides the upper strata of the peasantry, small artisans and tradesmen with a num­ ber of comparatively comfortable, quiet and respectable jobs which raise their holders above the people.
Consider what happened in Russia during the six months following March 12 [February 27], 1917.
The governmental posts which hitherto had been given by preference to members of the Black Hundreds now became the spoils of the Cadets, Mensheviks ·and Socialist-Revolu:~ tionaries.
Nobody really thought of introducing any serious re-and to put off the convocation of the Constituent Assembly until the end of the war! But there was no delay, no waiting for the Constituent Assembly in the matter of dividing the spoils, of getting the posts oof ministers, vice-ministers, governors-general, .
etc.
, etc.
! The game of combinations that was played in forming the government was, in essence, only an ex­ pression of this division and re-division of the "spoils," which was going on high and low, throughout the country, in every depart­ ment of central and local government.
The six months between March 12 [February 27] and September 9 [August 27], 1917, can be summed up, objectively summed up beyond all dispute, as fol­ lows: reforms shelved, distribution of official posts accomplished and "mistakes" in the distribution corrected by a few re-distributions.
But the more the bureaucratic apparatus is "re-distributed" among the various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties (among the Cadets, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, if we take the case of Russia), the more clearly the oppressed classes, with the proletariat at their head, become conscious of their irreconcilable hostility to the whole of bourgeois society; That is why it is neces­ sary for all bourgeois parties, even for the most democratic and "revolutionary-democratic" parties, to increase their repressive measures against the revolutionary proletariat, to strengthen the apparatus of repression, i.
e.
, the state machine that we are discuss­ ing.
This course of events compels the revolution "to concentrate all its forces of destrzl)ction" against the state power, and to regard the problem, not as one of perfecting the state machine, but one of smashing and destroying it.
It was not logical reasoning, but the actual development of events, the .
living experience of 1848-51, that led to the problem being presented in this way.
The extent to which Marx held strictly to the solid ground of historical experience can be seen from the fact that, in 1852, he did not yet deal concretely with the question of what was to take the place of the state machine that was to be destroyed.
Experience had not yet provided material for the solution of this problem which history placed on the order uf the day later on, in 18'71.
In its forces of destruction" against the state, of "breaking" -the state .
machine.
Here the question may .
arise: is it correct -to generalise the experience, <:>bservations and conclusions of Marx, -to apply them to a field that is wider.
than the history of France during the three years 1848-51? Before proceeding to answer .
this question we shall recall a remark made hy Engels, and then we shall pro· ceed to examine the facts.
In his introduction to the third edition of The Eighteenth Brumaire Engels wrote: "France is the land, where, more than anywhere else, the historical class struggles were each time fought out to a decision, and where, consequently, the changing political forms within which they occur and in which their results are summarised have likewise been stamped with the sharpest outlines~ The centre of feudalism in the Middle Ages, the model country of centralised monarchy resting on estates since the Renaissance, France has demolished feudalism in the Great Revolution and established the unalloyed rule of the bourgeoisie in a classical purity unequalled by any other European larid.
And the struggle of the upward striving proletariat against the ruling bourgeoisie also appeared here in an acute form unknown elsewhere.
" · The last sentence is out of date, inasmuch as a lull has oc­ curred in the revolutionary struggle · of the French proletariat since 1871; although, long as this lull may be, it does not pre­ clude the possibility that, in the coming proletarian revolution, France may once again reveal itself as the classic land ·of the class struggle to a decision.
Let us, however, cast a general glance over the history of the advanced countries at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth centuries.
We shall see that the same process has been going on more slowly, in more varied forms, on a much wider field: on the one hand, the development of "parliamentary power" in the republican countries.
(France, America, Switzer· land), as well as in the monarchies (England, Germany to a certain extent, Italy, the Scandinavian countries, etc.
); on the other hand, a struggle for power between the various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties which distribute and re-distribute the "spoils" of office, while the foundations of bourgeois society re· ·1 its bureaucratic and military apparatus.
There is not.
the slightest doubt that these features are common tG the wh~le 0£ the modern evolution of all capitalist states in general.
In the three years 1848·51 France displayed, in a swift, sharp, concentrated form, all the processes of development which are peculiar to the whole capitalist world.
Imperialism-the era of bank capital, the era of gigantic capitalist monopolies, the era of the transformation of monopoly capitalism into .
state-monopoly capitalism-has particularly wit­ nessed an unprecedented strengthening of the "state machine" and an unprecedented growth of its bureaucratic and military appara­ tus, in connection with the increase in.
repressive measures against the proletariat in the monarchical as well as in the freest repub­ lican countries.
World history is now undoubtedly leading to the "concentra­ tion of all the forces" of the proletarian revolution on the "de­ struction" of the state machine on an incomparably larger scale than in 1852.
What the proletariat will put in its place is indicated by the extremely instructive material provided by the Paris Commune.

THE PRESENTATION OF THE QUESTION BY MARX IN 1852 1 In 1907, Mehring, in the magazine N eue Zeit 2 (Vol.
XXV, 2, p.
164), published extracts from a letter from Marx to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852.
This letter, among other things, contains the following remarkable observation: "And now as to myself, no credit is due to me for discovering the existence of classes in modern society, nor yet the struggle between them.
Long before me, bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this class .
struggle, and bourgeois economists the economi? anatomy of the ?lasses.
What I did that was new was to prove: 1) that the existence of classes is ?nly b?und up with particular historical phases in the development of production [histor-1 This section was added by Lenin in the second Russian edition of The State and· Revolution, 1918.

this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and tO a classless society.
" 1 ' In ·these words Marx succeeded in expressing with striking clarity, first, the chief and radical difference between his doctrine and those of the most advanced and most profound thinkers of the bourgeoisie; and, second, the essence of his doctrine of the state.
It is often said and written that the core of Marx's theory is the class struggle; but it is not true.
And from this error, very often, springs the opportunist distortion of Marxism, its falsifica­ tion to make it acceptable to the bourgeoisie.
The theory of the class struggle was not created by Marx, but by the bourgeoisie before Marx, and generally speaking it is acceptable to the bour­ geoisie.
Those who recognise only the class struggle are not yet Marxists; those may be found to have gone no further than the boundaries of· bourgeois ·reasoning and boJJrgeois politics.
To limit Marxism to the theory of the class struggle means curtailing Marxism, distorting it, reducing it to something which is accept­ able to the bourgeoisie.
A Marxist is one who extends the accept­ ance of the class struggle to the acceptance of the dictatorship of the.
proletariat.
This is where the profound difference lies he· tween a Marxist and an ordinary petty (and even big) bourgeois.
This is the touchstone on which the real understanding and ac­ ceptance of Marxism should be tested.
And it is not surprising that when the history of Europe brought the working class face to face with this question in a practical way,· not only all the opportunists and reformists, but all the Kautskyists (those who vacillate between reformism and Marxism) proved to be miser­ able philistines and petty-bourgeois democrats who repudiated the dictatorship of the proletariat.
Kautsky's pamphlet, The Dictator­ ship of the Proletariat,* published in August 1918, i.
e.
, long after the first edition of the present pamphlet, is an example of the petty-bourgeois distortion of Marxism and base renunciation of it in practice, while hypocritically recognising it in words (see 1 The Correspondence of Marx and Engels.
-Ed.
Eng.
ed.
3 Present-day opportunism in the person of its.
principal rep­ resentative, the ex-Marxist, K.
Kautsky, fits in completely with Marx's characterisation of the bourgeois position as quoted above, for this opportunism limits the field of recognition of the class struggle to the realm of bourgeois relationships.
(Within this realm, within its framework, not a single educated liberal will r~fuse to recognise the class struggle "in principle"!) Op­ portumsm does not carry the recognition of class struggle to the main point, to the period of transition from capitalism to com­ munism, to the period of th.
e overthrow and complete abolition of the bourgeoisie.
In reality, this period inevitably becomes a pe­ riod of unusually violent class struggles in their sharpest possible forms and, therefore, during this period, the state must inevitahiy be a state that is democratic in a new way (for the proletariat and the propertyless in g~neral) and dictatorial in a new way (against the bourgeoisie).
· To proceed.
The essence of Marx's doctrine of the state is assimilated only by those who understand that the dictatorship of a single class is necessary not only for class society in general, ?ot only for the proletariat which has overthrown the bourgeoisie, but for the entire historical period between capitalism and "class­ less society," communism.
The forms of the bourgeois state are extremely varied, hut in essence they are all the same: in one way or another, in the last analysis, all these states are inevitably the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
The transition from capital­ ism to communism will certainly create a great variety and abun­ dance of political forms, hut in essence.
there will inevitably be only one: the dictatorship of the proletariat.

CHAPTER III THE STATE AND REVOLUTION.
EXPERIENCE .
OF THE PARIS COMMUNE OF 1871.
MARX'S ANALYSIS.
1.
WHEREIN LAY THE lIEROISM oF THE CoMMUNARDs' ATTEMPT? IT is well known that in the autumn ·of 1870, a few months before the Commune, Marx warned the Paris workers that an attempt to overthrow the ·government would he desperate folly.
But when, in March 1871, a decisive battle was forced upon the workers and they accepted it, when the uprising had become a fact, Marx greeted the proletarian revolution with the greatest enthusiasm, in spite of unfavourable auguries.
Marx did not assume the rigid attitude of pedantically condemning a "premature" movement as did the ill-famed Russian renegade from Marxism, Plekhanov, who, in November 1905, wrote encouragingly about the workers' and peasants' struggle but, after December 1905, cried, liberal fashion: "They should not have taken to arms.
'' 1 Marx, however, was not only epthusiastic about the heroism of the Communards who "stormed the heavens," as he expressed it.
Although it did not achieve its aim, he regarded the mass revolu­ tionary movement as a historic experiment of gigantic importance, as an advance of the world proletarian revolution, as a practical step that was more important than hundreds of programmes and discussions.
Marx conceived his task to be to analyse this experi­ ment, to draw lessons in tactics from it, to.
re-examine his theory in the nfJw light it afforded.
Marx made the only "correction" he thought it necessary to make in The Communist Manifesto on the basis of the revolution­ ary experience of the Paris Communards.

3* 35 this preface the authors, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, say !hat the programme of The Communist Manifesto "has in some de­ tails become antiquated" now, and they go on to say: "One thing especially was proved hy the Commune, viz.
, that 'the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes.
' " The authors took the words in single quotation marks in the above-quoted passage from Marx's book, The Civil War in France.
Thus, Marx and Engels regarded one .
of the principal and fundamental lessons of the Paris Commune as being of such enor­ mous _importance that they introduced it as a vital correction in The Communist Manifesto.
It is extremely characteristic that it is precisely this vita.
I correction that has been distorted by the opportunists, and its meaning, probably, is not known to nine-tenths, if not ninety-nine­ hundre.
dths, of the readers_of The Communist Manifesto.
We shall deal with this distortion more fully further on, in a chapter devoted specially to distortions.
Here it will be sufficient to note that the current vulgar "interpretation" of Marx's famous utterance quoted above .
is that Marx here emphasises the idea of gradual .
development in contradistinction to the seizure of power, and so on.
· As a matter of fact, exactly the opposite is the case.
Marx's idea is that the working class must break up, smash µie "ready.
made state machinery," and not confine itself merely to laying hold of it.
On April 12, 1871, i.
e.
, just at the time of the Commune, Ma:rx wrote to Kugelmann: "If you look at the last chapter of my Eighteenth Brurnriire, you will find· that.
I say that the next attempt of the french Revolutfon will be no longer, a5 before, to transfer the bureaucratic-military machine from one hand to an­ other, but.
to smash it [Marx's italics-the original is zerbrechen]; and this· is essential for every real people's revoluiion on the Continent.
And this is '\Vhat_ our heroic Party COJJ'.
\Iades in _Paris are attempting.

) ma· chine," briefly' express the principal lesson of Marxism on ·the tasks of the proletariat in relation to the state during a revolu­ tion.
And it is precisely this lesson that has been not only com· pletely forgotten, but positively distorted, in the prevailing Kaut­ skyan "interpretation" of Marxism.
As for Marx's reference to The Eighteenth Brumaire, we quoted the cor:responding passage in full above.
It is interesting .
to note two particular points in the above­ qu~ted passage in Marx's argument.
First, he confines his conclu­ sions to the Continent.
This was natural in 1871, when England was still the model of a purely capitalist country, but without militarism and, to .
a considerable degree, .
without a bureaucracy.
Hence Marx excluded England, where a revolution, even a peo­ ple's ~evolution could be conceived of, and wa:s then possible, without the condition o~ first destroying the "ready-made state tnachinery.
"* Today, in 1917, in the epoch of the first great imperialist war, Marx's exception is no longer valid.
Both England .
and Amer­ fo~, the gr·eatest and Ia·st representatives of Anglo-Saxon "liberhty,'' "in the sense that militarism and bureaucracy are absent, .
ave today plunged headlong into the all-European, ·filthy, blo~dy morass of bureaucratic-military institutions to which everythmg is subordinated and which trample everything under foot.
To­ day, both in England and America, the "essential" thing for "every real people's.
revolution" is the smashing, the destruction of the ·"ready-made state machinery" (brought in those countries .
.
between 1914 and 1917, to general "European" imperialist perfection).
' Secondly,.
particular attention should be paid to.
Marx's ex­ tremely profound remark that the destruction of the military and bureaucratic state machine is "essential for every real people's ~evolution.
" This idea of a "people's" revolution seems strange coming.
from Marx, _and the Russian Plekhanovist11 and Menshe­ viks, those followers of Struve who wish to be regarded as Marx­ ists, might possibly declare such an expression to be a "slip of the pen.
" They have reduced Marxism to such a state of wretched "liberal" distortion that nothing exists for them beyond the less way.
.
If, for example, we take the revolutions of the twentieth century, we shall, of course, have to admit that the Portuguese and the Turkish revolutions are bourgeois revolutions.
Neither, however, is a "people's" revolution, inasmuch as in neither of them does the mass of the people, the enormous majority, come out actively, independently, with its own economic and political de­ mands.
On the other hand, although the Russian bourgeois revolu­ tion of 1905-07 presented no such "brilliant" successes as at times.
fell to the lot of -the Portuguese and Turkish revolutions, it was undoubtedly a "real people's'' revolution, since the mass of the people, the majority, the "lowest soeial ranks," crushed by oppression and exploitation, rose independently, -since they put on the entire course of the revolution the impress of their demands, of their attempts to build in thefr own way a new society in place of the old society that was being destroyed.
In Europe, in 1871, there was not a single country on the Continent in which the proletariat constituted the majority of the people.
A "people's" revolution, that swept actually the majority into its stream, could be such only if it embraced the proletariat and the peasantry.
Both classes then constituted the "people.
" Both classes were united by the fact that the "bureaucratic-military state machine" oppressed, crushed, exploited them.
To smash this machine, to break it up-this iS what is truly in the interests of the "people," of the majority, the workers and most of the peas­ ants, this is what is "essential" for the free alliance between the poor peasantry and the proletarians; without such an alliance democracy is unstable and the socialist reformation is impossihleo As is well known, the Paris Commune strove for such an alli­ ance, although it failed to achieve it owing to a number of cir­ cumstances, internal and external.
Consequently, in speaking of a "real people's revolution,'' Marx, without fo the least forgetting the peculiM characteristics of the petty hourgeoisfo (he spoke a.
great deal about them.
and t t r m Europe in 1871.
On the other hand, he asserted that the "smashing" of the state machine was necessary in the interests of the workers and of the peasants, that it unites them, that it places before t~en:-the com­ mon task of removing the "parasite" and of substitutmg some-thing new for it.
What exactly? 2.
WHAT Is To SUPERSEDE THE SMASHED STATE MACHINE? In 1847, in The Communist Manifesto, Marx's answer to this question was still a purely abstract one, or, to speak ~ore correct!!, it was an answer that indicated the problem, but did not solve it.
The answer given in The Communist Manifesto was that "the proletariat organised as the ruling class" "to w~n the battle of democracy" was to he the substitute for this machme.
.
.
.
Marx did not drop into utopia; he expected the ex~erience of the mass movement to provide the reply to the quest10~ of the exact forms the organisation of the proletariat as the ~ul1:1g cla.
ss will assume and the exact manner in which this _organ1s~t10:1 will be combined with the most complete, most consistent wmmng of "the battle of democracy.
" .
Marx subjected the experience of the Co:n::n:une, m~agre as it was to the most careful analysis in The Civil War in France.
Let 'us quote the most important passages of this work.
.
.
.
There developed in the nineteenth century, he says, ongmatrng from the days of the Middle Ages, "the centrali.
sed state power, with its ubiquitous organs of standing army, pohce, hureaucr.
acy, clergy and judicature.
" With the development of class antagomsms between capital and labour " .
.
.
the state power assu~ed more and more the character of the national power of capital over labour, of a public force organised for social.
enslave~ent, of an engine of class despotism.
After every revolution ma:kmg a pro­ gressive phase in the class struggle, the purely repress1v~ c~:racter of the state power stands out in bolder and bolder rehef.
After I I, ~ar engine of capital against labour.
" The Second Empire con­ solidated this.
"The direct antithesis to the Empire was the Commune," says Marx.
It was the "positive form" of "a republic that was not only to supersede the monarchical form of class rule, but class rule itself.
" What was this "positive" form of the proletarian, the socialist republic? What was the state it was beginning to create? "The first decree of the Commune .
.
.
was the suppression of the standing army, and the substitution for it of the armea people," says Marx.
This demand now figures in the programme of every party calling itself Socialist.
But the value of their programmes is best shown by the behaviour of our Socialist-Revolutionaries and Men­ sheviks, who, precisely after the revolution of March 12 [Febru· ary 27],.
1917, refused to carry out this demand! "The Commune was formed of the municipal councillors, chosen by uni­ versal suffrage in the various wards of the town, responsible and revocable at short terms.
The majority .
of its members were naturally working men, or acknowledged representatives.
of the working class .
.
•.
Instead of continuing to be the 'agent of the Central Government, the· police was at once stripped of its political attributes, and turned into the responsible and at ail times revocable agent .
of the Commune.
So were the officials of all other branches of the administration.
From the members of the Commune downwards, the public service had to be done at workmen's wages.
The vested interests and the representation allowances of the high dignitaries of state disappeared along with the high dignitaries themselves .
.
.
.
"Having once got rid of the standing army and the police, the physical force elements of the old government, the Commune was anxious to b>:eak the spiritual force of repression, the 'parson-power.
'.
.
.
"The judicial functionaries were to be divested of [their] sham independ­ ence .
.
.
.
Like the rest of the public servants, magistrates and judges were to be elective, responsible and revocable.
" t Thus the Commune appears to have substituted "only" fuller democracy for the smashed state machine: abolition of the stand~ ing army; all officials to be elected and subject to recall.
But as a matter of fact this "only" si!:?:llifies the very important -substitu­ tion of one type of institution for others of a fundamentally differ-l The Civil War in Fra:nce, sec.

l quality": democracy, introduced as fully and cons~stently .
·as is generally conceivable, is transformed from b~urgeo1s d~mocracy into proletarian ·democracy; from the state (i.
e.
, a special .
for:e for the suppression of a particular class) info something which is no longer really a state.
.
.
.
.
.
.
· It .
is ·still necessary to suppress the botirgeolSle and crush its resistance.
This was particularly necessary for the Commune; and one of the reasons for its defeat was that it did not do this with suffi~ient determination.
But the organ of suppression is now the majority of the population, and not the minority,.
as was.
always the case ·under slavery, serfdom and wage-slavery.
And s:~ce t_he majority of the people itself suppresses its oppressors: a· special force" for suppression is no longer· necessary .
.
In ~his.
se~se the state begins to wither away.
Instead of the special mstltut10ns of a privileged minority (privileged officialdom, heads of ·the standing army), the majority itself can directly fulfil all these functions and the more thi: functions of state power devolve upon the people generally, the less need .
is there for the existence of th.
is power.
.
.
.
· · .
In this connection the measures adopted by the Commune·· and emphasised by Marx are particularly noteworthy, viz.
, the ab?l~­ tion of all representation allowances, and of all monetary _rnvi­ Jeges in the case of officials; the reduction of the remuneration of I l f " k ' " all servants of the state to the eve o wor men s wages.
This shows more clearly than anything else the turn ·from hour· geois democracy to proletarian democracy, from the democracy of the oppressors to the democracy of the opp;essed cla~ses, from the state as a .
"special force" for the suppress10n of a given class to the suppression of the oppressors by the general force of the majority of the people-the workers and the.
peasants .
.
And it is precisely on this most striking point, perhaps the most 1mpor~ant as far as the problem of the state is concerned, that the teachmgs of Marx have been most completely forgotten! In popular com­ ment~ries, the number of which is .
legion, this is not mentio:ned; It is "good form" to keep silent aboi1t it as H it were a piece of I' ! 't-'.
had attained the position of a state religion, "forgot" the "naivete" of primitive Christianity with its derp.
ocratic revolutionary spirit.
.
The reduction of the remuneration of the highest state officials seems to he "simply" a demand of naive, primitive democracy.
One of the "founders" of modern opportunism, the ex-Social-Dem­ ocrat, Eduard Bernstein, has more than once exercised his talents in repeating the vulgar bourgeois jeers at "primitive" democracy.
* Like all opportunists; including the present Kautskyists, he utter­ ly fails to understand that, first of all, the transition from capital­ ism to socialism is impossible without some "reversion" to "prim­ itive" democracy (how else can the majority, and even the whole population, proceed to discharge state functions?) ; and, sec­ ondly, he forgets that "priinitive democracy" based on capitalism and capitalist culture i's not the same as primitive democracy in prehistorfo or pre-capitalist times.
Capitalist culture has created large-scale production, factories, railways, the postal service, tele­ phones, etc.
, and on this basis the great majority of functions of the old "state power'' have become so simplified and can he re­ duced to such simple operations of registration, filing and checking that they can he easily performed.
by every literate person, and it will be possible to perform them for "workmen's wages," which circumstances can (and must) strip those functions of every shadow of privilege, of every semblance of "official grandeur.
" All offi~ials, without exception, elected and subject to recall at any time, their salaries reduced to the level of "workmen's · wages"-these simple and "self-evident" democratic measures, while completely uniting the interests of the workers and the ma­ jority of the peasants, at the same time serve as the bridge between capitalism and socialism.
These measures concern the purely poli­ tical reconstruction· of society; but, of course, they acquire their full meaning and significance only in connection with the "expro­ priation of the expropriators," either accomplished or in prepara~ ti on, i.
e.
, with the transformation.
of capitalist private ownership ~f the-means of production into social ownership.
Marx.
wrote~ standin~ army and state functionarism.
" 1 · From the peasantry, as fr~m other sections of the petty bour­ ,geoisie, only an insignificant few "rise to the top," "get on in the world" in the bourgeois sense, i.
e.
, become either well-to-do people, bourgeois or officials in secure and privileged positions.
In every capitalist country where there is a peasantry (and this is the c~se in most capitalist countries), the vast majority of the peasants is op­ pressed by the government and longs for its overthrow, longs _for "cheap" government.
This can be achieved only by the proletariat; and by achieving it, the proletariat at the same time takes a step for-ward towards the socialist reconstruction of the state.

THE ABOLITION OF p ARLIAMENTARISM Marx said: "The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary body, executive and legislative at the same time .
.
•.
" .
.
· · .
"Instead of deciding.
once in three or six years which member of the rulmg cfass was to misrepresent the people in parliament, universal suffrage was to serve the peol)le, constituted in Communes, -as individual s~rag~ serv~s ev~;; other employer in the search for the workmen and managers m his busmess.
Thanks to the prevalence of social-chauvinism and opportu­ nism, this remarkable criticism of parliamentarism made in 1871 also belongs now to the "forgotten words" of Marxism.
The Cab­ inet Ministers and professional.
parliamentarians, the traitors to the proletariat and the "practical" Socialists of ?ur day, have le~t all criticism of parliamentarism to the anarchists, and, on this wonderfully intelligent ground, they denounce all criticism of parlia­ mentarism as "anarchism"!! It is not surprising that the prole­ tariat .
of the "advanced" parliamentary countries, disgusted with such "Socialists" as Messrs.
Scheidemann, David, Legien, Sembat, Renaudel, Henderson, Vandervelde, Stauning, Branting, Bissolati a:nd Co.
, has been mor~ mid more often giving its sympathies to ·qbid;:.
:_£d.
_Eng.
eif ·the twin brother of opportunism.
.
But for Marx, revolutionary dialectics was never the empty lashionable phrase, the toy rattle,· which Plekhanov Kautskv and • < ' "-• th.
e others have made of it.
Marx knew how to break with anarch-ism ruthlessly for 'its inability to make use ~ven of the ''pig-sty" of bourgeois parliamentarism, especially at a time when the situation was obviously not revolutionary; but at the same time he knew how to subject parliamentarism to genuine revolutionary-prole­ tarian criticism.
To decide once every few~ years which member of the ruling class is to misrepresent the people in parliament 'is the real essence of bourgeois parliamentarism, not only in parliamentary-constitu· tional monarchies, but also in the most democratic republics.
But since we are discussing the question : of the state, and if parliamentarism is to be regarded as one of the institutions of the state from the point of view of the tasks of the proletariat in this field, what is the way out of parliamentarism? How can it be dispensed with? .
-Again and again we must repeat: the lessons of Marx, based on the study of the Commune, have been so completely forgotten that any criticism of parliamentarism, other than anarchist or re­ actionary criticism, is quite unintelligible to the present-day "Social-Democrat" (read present-day traitor to socialism).
.
The way out of parliamentarism is not, of course, the abolition of the representative institutions and the electoral principle, but the conversion of the representative institutions from mere "talk­ ing shops" into working bodies.
"The Commune was to be a working, not a parliamentary body executive .
and legislative at the same time.
" ' "A working, not a parliamentary body"-this hits the nail on the head in regard to the present-day parliamentarians and the parliamentary "lap dogs" of Social-Democracy! Take any parlia­ mentary country, from America to Switzerland, from France to England, Norway and so forth-in these countries the actual work of the "state" is done behin·d the scenes and is carried on by the the "common people.
" This-is so true that even in_.
the Rus;;i~n republic, a bourgeois-democratic republic, all these sms of parl~a­ mentarism were immediately revealed, even before a real parlia­ ment was created.
The heroes of rotten philistinism, such as the Skobelevs and the Tseretellis, the Chernovs and Avksentyevs, have managed to pollute even the Soviets with the pollution ~f disgust­ ing bourgeois parliarrientarism and to convert the,m ,~nto.
~er~ talking shops.
In the Soviets, the Right Honourable Socialist Ministers· are fooling the confiding peasants with phrasemonger· ing and resolutions.
In the government itself a sort of permanent quadrille is going on in order that, .
on the on~ hand, as many Socialist~Revolutionaries and Menshev1ks as possible may get near the "pie," the lucrative and honourable posts, and that, on the ot:1er hand, the "'attention of the people" may be engaged.
Meanwhile, the real "state" business is being done in the government offices, in the Ge'ueral Staff.
Dyelo Naroda,1 the organ of the ruling "Socialist-Revolution-ary" Party, recently admitted in an editorial article--with the matchless candour of people of "good society," in which "all'' are engaged in political prostitution-that even in those Ministries of which the "Socialists" (save the mark) are at the head, the whole bureaucratic apparatus has in fact remained as before, that it is working in the old way, "freely" sabotaging revolutionary measures.
Even without this admission, would not the actual his­ tory of the participation of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Men­ sheviks in the government prove this? The only characteristic thing in this is that while in the Ministerial company of the Cadets, Messrs.
Chernov, Rusanov, Zenzinov and the other editors of Dyelo -, Naroda have so completely lost· all shame that they unblushingly proclaim, as if it were a mere bagatelle, that in "their" Ministries everything has remained as before! Revolutionary-democratic phra·.

Socialism simplifies the functions of "state" administration; it enables the methods of "official administration" to he thrown aside and the whole business to he reduced to a matter· of organ­ ising the proletarians (as the ruling class); which hires "workmen and managers" in the name of the whole of society.
We are not utopians, we do not indulge in "dreams" of dis· pensing at once with all administration, with all subordination; these anarchist dreams, baaed upon a lack of understanding of the tasks of the proletarian dictatorship, are totally alien to Marxism, and, as a matter of fact, serve only to postpone the socialist revolu­ tion until human nature has changed.
No, we want the socialist revolution with human nature as it is now, with human nature that cannot dispense with subordination, control and "managers.
" But the subordination must he to the armed vanguard of all the exploited, of all the toilers, i.
e.
, to the proletariat.
Measures must he taken at once, overnight, to substitute for the specific methods of "official administration" by state officials the simple functions of "workmen and managers," functions which are al­ ready fully within the capacity of the average city dweller and can well he performed for "workmen's wages.
" We ourselves, the workers, will organise large-scale production on the basis of what capitalism has already created; we shall rely on our own experience as workers, we shall establish strict, iron discipline supported by the state power of the armed workers, we shall reduce the role of the state officials to that of simply carry­ ing out our instructions as responsible, revocable, moderately paid "managers" (of course, with the aid of technicians of all sorts, types and degrees).
This is our proletarian task, this is what we can and must start with in carrying out the proletarian revolution.
of all bureaucracy, to the gradual creation of an order, order without quotation marks, which will be different from wage-::davery, an order in which the functions of control and accounting-becoming more and more simple-will be performed by each in turn, will then become a habit and will finally die out as the special functions of a special stratum of the.
population.
A witty German Social-Democrat of the seventies of the last century called the post-office .
an example of the socialist system.
This is very true.
At present the post-office is a business organised on the lines of a state capitalist monopoly.
Imperialism is gradu­ ally transforming all trusts into organisations of a similar type.
Over the "common" toilers, :who are overworked and starved, there stands the same bourgeois bureaucracy.
But the mechanism of social management is here already to hand.
Overthrow the cap· italists, crush the resistanc.
e of these exploiters with the iron hand of the armed workers, smash the bureaucratic machine of the modern state-and you will have a mechanism of the highest tech~ nical equipment, free from the "parasite," capable of being wielded by the united workers themselves, who will hire their own: technicians; managers and bookkeepers, and pay them all, as, indeed every "state" official, ordinary workmen's wages.
Here is a.
concrete, practicable task, immediately possible ~of fulfilment in relation to all trusts, a task that frees the toilers from exploitation and takes into account what the Commune had already begun to carry out (particularly in the field of state construction).
Our immediate object is to organise the whole of national economy on the lines of the postal system, so that the technicians, managers, bookkeepers, as well as all officials, shall receive salar­ ies no higher than "workmen's wages," ail under the control and leadership of the armed proletariat.
It is such a state, standing on such an.
economic basis, that we need.
This is what will bring about the abolition of parliamentarism and the preservation of representative institutions.
This is what will rid the labouring classes of the prostitution ·O.
f these institutions by the bourgeoisie.

" 1 To what extent the opportuni~ts of present-day Social-Democ­ racy have failed to understand-or perhaps it w(luld be more true to say, did not want to underst~nd-:--these observations of Marx is best shown by the famous (the fa!l1e of Herostratus) book of the renegade Bernstein, Die V oraussetzungen des Sozialismus und die Au/ gab en der Sozialdemokratie.

In spite of all tbe other points of difference between Marx and the 'petty-bourgeois' Proudhon [Bernstein places tbe word "petty-bourgeois" in quotation marks in order to· make ii sound ironical], on these points their ways of thinking resemble each other as closely as could be.

" To confuse .
Marx's views .
.
on the "destruction of the state power" -of the "parasitic excrescence"-with Proudhon's federalism is positively monstrous! But it is not an accident, for it never occurs to the opportunist that Marx does not speak here about federalism as opposed to centralism, -but about smashing the old bourgeois state machine which exists in all bourgeois countries.
The only thing that penetrates the opportunist's mind is what he sees around him, in a society of petty-bourgeois philistinism and _"reformist" stagnation, namely, only "municipalities"! The opportunist has· even forgotten how to think about the proletarian revolution.
-It is ridiculous.
But it is remarkable that nobody disputed Bernstein on this point! Bernstein has been refuted often enough, especially by Plekhanov in Russian literature and by Kautsky in European literature, but neither of them said anything about this distortion of Marx by Bernstein.
--The opportunist has forgotten to think in a revolutionary way and to ponder over revolution to such an extent that he attributes ~'federalism" to Marx and confuses him with the founder of a:r'iar­ chism, Proudhon.
And Kautsky and Plekhanov, the would-be orthodox Marxists and defenders of the doctrine of revolutionary Marxism, are silent on this point! Herein lies one of the roots of the extreme vulgarisation of the views concerning the difference between Marxism and anarchism which is characteristic of the I):autskyists and opportunists, and which we shall discuss later.
Marx's observations on the experience of the ·Commune which we quoted above do not reveal a trace of federalism.
Mar:X: agreed with Proudhon on the very point that the opportunist Bernstein failed to see.
Marx disagreed with Proudhon on the very point on which Bernstein said there was agreement.
Marx agreed with Proudhon on the necessity of "smashing" the present state machine·.
-Neither the Kautskyists nor the op-(Pr-oudhon and Bakunin) because on this point they have departed from Marxism.
-Marx differed with Proudhon and with Bakunin precisely on the poi~t of federalism (quite apart from the dictatorship of the proletariat).
The petty·bourgeois views of anarchism advance federalism as a principle.
Marx was_ a.
centralist.
There is no de­ parture from centralism in the observations of Marx quoted above.
Only those who are imbued with the petty-bourgeois "superstitious belief" in the state can.
mistake the abolition of the bourgeois state machine for the abolition of centralism! But will it not he centralism when the proletariat and poorest peasantry take political power in their own hands, organise themselves freely.
in communes, and unite the action of all the communes in striking at capital, in crushing the resistance of the capitalists, in transferring the ownership of the railways, factories, la~d and so forth, to the entire nation, to the whole of society? Will that not he the most consistent democratic centralism? And proletarian centralism at that? Ber?stein simply cannot conceive the possibility of voluntary centralism, of the voluntary amalgamation of the communes into a nation, the voluntary fusion of the proletarian· communes in the process of destroying bourgeois rule and the bourgeois state ma­ chine.
Li~e all philistines, Bernstein can imagine centralism only as something from above, to be imposed and maintained solely by means of bureauci:acy and militarism.
.
Marx, as though foreseeing the possibility of the distortion of his ideas, deliberately emphasised the fact that the charge that the Commune desired to destroy the rinity of the nation, to abolish the central power, was an intentional misstatement.
Marx deliber­ ately used the words: "The unity of the nation was • • .
to be organised," so as to contrast conscious, democratic proletarian centralism with bourgeois, military, bureaucratic centralism.
.
But no one is s~ deaf as he who will not hear.
And the very thmg the opportumsts of present-day Social-Democracy do not want to hear about is the abolition of state power, the excision of the parasite.

e''; the "repressive organs" of which were to he "ampu· tated"; the "destruction" of "the now superseded state power"~ these are the expressions used by Marx concerning the state in appraising and analysing the experience of the Commune.
All this was written a little less than half a century ago; and Il,OW one has to make excavations, as it were, to bring undistorted Marxism to the knowledge of the masses.
The conclusions drawn from the observation of the last great revolutioD,, through which Marx lived, were forgotten just at the moment when the time for the next great proletarian revolutions h'1d '1rrived.
"The multiplicity of interpretations to which the Commune has been subjected and the multiplicity of interests which construed it in their favour show that it was a thoroughly expansive political form, while all p:revious forms of government had been emphatically repressive.
Its true secret was this.
It was essentially a working class government, the produce of the strug­ gle of the producing against the appropriating class, the political form at last discovered under which to work out the economic.

the political forms under which the socialist transformation of society was to take place.
The anarchists waived the question of politic'11 forms altogether.
The opportunists of present-day Social-Demo· cracy accepted the bourgeois political forms of the parliamentary democratic state as the unsurpassable limit; they battered their foreheads praying before this idol and denounced every .
attempt to smash these forms as anarchism.
Marx deduced from the whole history of Socialism and of the political struggle that the state was hound to disappear, and that the transitional form of its disappearance (the transition fron\.
state to no state) would he the "proletariat organised as the rul­ ing class.
" But Marx did not set out to discover the political forms of this future stage.
He limited himself to a precise observation of French history, to analysing it, and to the conclusion to which ·the year 1851 had led, viz.
, that matters were moving towards the smashing of the bourgeois state machine.
· · And when the mass revolutionary movement of the proletariat burst forth, Marx, in spite of the failure of that movement, in spite of its short life and its patent weakness, began to study the political forms that it had disclosed.
· The Commune is the form "at last discovered" by the prole· tarian revolution, under which to ~ork out the economic emanci· pation of labour.
The Commune is the first attempt of a proletarian revolution to smash the bourgeois state machine and it constitutes the poli­ tical form, "at last discovered," which can and must supersede the smashed machine.
We shall see below that the Russian Revolution of 1905 and 1917 in different circumstances and under different conditions, ' ' continued the work of the Commune and corroborated Marx s brilliant historical analysis.
CHAPTER IV CONTINUATION.
SUPPLEMENTARY EXPLANATIONS BY ENGELS MARx gave the fundamentals-on the question of the significance of the experience of the Commune.
Engels returned to the same subject repeatedly and explained Marx's analysis and conclusions sometimes illuminating other sides of the question· with such strength and vividness that it is necessary to deal with his explan· ations separately.
1.
"THE HOUSING QUESTION" In his work, ~he Housing Question (1872), Engels took into a~count the expenence of the Commune, and dealt several times ~1th t~e tasks of the revolution in relation to the state.
It is mterestmg to note that the treatment of this concrete subject re­ vealed, on the one hand, points of similarity between the proletarian state and the present state--.
,-features which give grounds for speak­ ing of the state in both cases-and, on the other hand, the fea­ tures which differentiate them, or the features of the transition to the abolition of the state.
"How is the housing question to he solved then? In present-day society j st as any other social question is solved: by the gradual economic adjust~:nt of supply and dema~d, a solut~on which ever reproduces the question itself anew.
and therefore IS no solution.
How a social revolution would solve this question d.
epends not only on.
the circum~tances which would exist in each cas:, but IS also connected with much more far-reaching questions, among which one of the most fundamental is the abolition of the antithesis between town and country, As it is not our task to create utopian systems for the hrangem:nt of the society of the future, it would be more than idle to go into ~ ~ quest:on.
here.
But on? thing is certain: there are already in existence suf­ ,.
men~ bmldmgs for ~wellmgs in the big towns to remedy immediately any real hkusmg shortage,' given rational utilisation of them.
This can naturally only ta e place by the npropriation of the present owners and by quartering in ·-s~ in their old houses.
Immediately the proletariat has conquered political power such a measure dictated in the public interest will be just as easy to carry out as other expropriations and billetings are by the e:idstin:g state.
" 1 The change in the form of the state power is not discussed here, only the content of its activity is discussed.
Expropriations and billeting of houses take place by order even of the present state.
From the formal point of view the proletarian state :will also "order" the occupation of houses and expropriation of build­ ings.
But it is clear that the old executive apparatus, the bureau­ cracy, which is connected with the bourgeoisie, would simply be unfit to carry out the orders of the proletarian state.
" •.
.
For the rest it must he pointed out that the 'actual seizure' of all instruments of labour, the seizure of industry as a whole by the working people, is the direct contrary of the Proudhonist theory of 'gradual redemp· tion.
' Under the latter, the individual, worker becomes the owner of the dwell-.
ing, the peasant-farm, the instruments of labour; under the former, the 'working people' remain the collective owners of the houses, factories and in$truments of labour, and would hardly permit of their use, at least in ~ transitional period, by individuals and associations without compensation for the costs, jusC as the abolition of property in land is not the abolition o1 ground rent, but its transfer, although in a modified form, to society.
The actual seizure of all the instruments of labour by the working people there­ fore does not at all exclude the retention of the rent relations.
" 1 We shall discuss the question touched upon in this passage, namely, the economic reasons for the withering away of the state, in the next chapter.
Engels expresses himself most cautiously, say· ing that the proletarian state would "hardly" permit, "at least in a transitional period," the use of houses without compensation for the cost.
The letting of houses that belong to the whole people to separate families presupposes the collection of rent, a certain amount of control, and a certain standard of allotment of houses.
All this calls for a certain form of state, but it does not call for a special military and bureaucratic apparatus, with officials occupy­ ing especially privileged positions.
The transition ·to a state of .
affairs when it will he possible to let houses rent-frea is bound up with the complete "withering away" of the stat~.

~ ! _ ~ the conversion of the Blanquists to the principles of Marxism after the Commune and as a result of its experience~ Engels, hi passing, formulates these principles as follows: " .
.
• Necessity 0£ political action of the proletariat, and of the dictatorship of the proletariat .
as the transitional stage to the abolition of classes and.
with them, of the state .
••• "1 ·· Addicts to hair-splitting criticism, and bourgeois "extermin­ ators of Marxism," will perhaps see a contradiction between this recognition of the ".
abolition of the state" and the repudiation of this formula as an anarchist one in the previously-quoted passage from Anti-Duhring.
It would not he surprising if the opportunists stamped Engels, too, as an "anarchist," for the habit of accusing the internationalists of anarchism is becoming more and more widespread among the social-chauvinists.
·Marxism always taught that the state will he abolished with the abolition of classes.
The well-known passage on the "withering away of the state" in Anti-Duhring does not blame the anarchists simply for being in favour of the abolition of the ·state, hut for preaching that the state can he abolished "overnight.
" In view of the fact that the now prevailing "Social-Democratic" doctrine completely distorts the relation of Marxism to anarchism on the question of the abolition of the state, it will he very useful to recall a certain controversy conducted by Marx and Engels with the anarchists.
· 2.
CONTROVERSY WITH THE ANARCHISTS This controversy took place in 1873.
Marx and Engels contri­ buted articles against the Proudhonists, "autonomists" or "anti­ authoritarians," to an Italian Socialist annual,* and it was not until 1913 that these articles appeared in German in Neue Zeit.
Ridi­ culing the anarchists_ and their repudiation of politics, Marx wrote; "If the political struggle of the working class assumes violent forms, if the workers ~et up their revolutionary dictatorship in place of the dictatorship of the bourgeo~sie, the.
y commit the terrible crime of vi~lating principles,.
for in order !{) satisfy their w_retched, ~gar, everyday needs, in order to crush the 1 lbid.

I It was exclusively against this kind of "abolition'; of the state that Marx fought in refuting the anarchists! He did not combat the theory that the state would disappear when classes· disappeared, or that it would be abolished when classes are abolished; he op· posed the proposition that the workers should renounce the use of arms, the use of organised force, that is, the use of the state, in order to "crush the resistance of the bourgeoisie.
" To prevent the true meaning of his struggle against the anar-· chists from being distorted, Marx deliberately emphasised the "revolutionary and transitor')· form" of the state which the prole­ tariat needs.
The proletariat needs the state only temporarily.
We do not at all disagree with the anarchists on the question of the abolition of the state as an aim.
We maintain that, to achieve this aim, we must temporarily make use of the instruments, resources and methods of the state power against the exploiters, just as the dictatorship of the oppressed class is temporarily necessary for the abolition of classes.
Marx chooses the sharpest and clearest way of stating his position against the anarchists: after overthrow­ ing the yoke of the capitalists, should the workers "lay down their arms," or use them against the capitalists in order to crush their resistance? But what is the systematic use of arms by one class against the other, if not a "transitory form" of state? J.
,et every Social-Democrat ask himself: is that the way he has been putting the question of the state in controversy with the anarchists? Is that the way the vast majority of the official So­ cialist Parties of the Second International have been putting it? Engels enlarges on the same ideas in even greater detail and more simply.
First of all he ridicules the muddled ideas of the Proudhonists, who called themselves "anti-authoritarians," i.
e.
, they repudiated every sort of authority, every sort of suhordina~ tion, every sort of power.
Take a factory, a railway, a ship on.

; I r': a certain amount of subordination and, consequently, without some authority or power? "When I put these arguments," writes Engels "up against the most rabid anti-~uthoritarians, they were only ahle to give· m: the following answer: 'Ah! that is true, hu_t ~ere ,it is not a case of authority which we confer on delegates, but of a commission! These gentlemen think that they have changed the thing by changing its name .
.
.
.
" Having thus shown that authority and autonomy are relative terms, that the sphere of their application varies with the various phases of social development, that it is absurd to take them as absolutes, and adding that the sphere of the application of ma~ chinery and large-scale production is constantly becoming en­ larged, Engels passes from the general discussion of authority to the question of the state and wr-ites: " .
•• _I£ !he autonomists would confine themselves to saying that the social orgamsation of the future will restrict authority to the limits in which the relations of production make it inevitable, we could understand· each other, hut they are b~ind to all facts which make the thing necessary, and they hurl themselves agamst the word.
.
:'Why don't.
the ant!·authoritarians confine themselves to crying out against poht1c_al ~utho:1~y, agamst the state? All socialists are agreed that the state, and w1~h it ~oht1cal authority, will disappear as the result of the coming social revolution, i.
e.
, that public functions will lose their political character and he ;ran_sformed into the simple administrative functions of watching over real social mterests.
But the anti-authoritarians demand that the political state ~h?uld h~ abolished at once, even before the social conditions which br.
ough~ It mto _hemg have been abolished.
They demand that the first act of the social revolution shall be the abolition of authority.
"Have these _gen_tleme~ never seen a revolution? A revolution is undoubtedly the mo~t a~thontan~n t~mg there is.
It is the act whereby one part of the population 1mpo_ses its will upon the other part by means of rifles, bayonets ~d c~nnon, whi?h.
are authoritarian means if ever there were any.
And the VIctor1ous party, if it does not _wish to have fought in vain, must maintain its rule by ~eans of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionaries.
Would the Pa_ns Commune have lasted a single day if it had riot made use of this authority of the armed population ci.
g"ainst the bourgeoisie? Should we not on !he? contrary repr_oach it for not having ma~e more extensive use of this author­ ~ty · The~efore eit!ier one of two things is possible: either the anti-authoritar­ ian~ d?n t know what they are saying, and in this case they sow nothino-·hut con usion, or .
they d~ know, and in this case they are betraying the ~!!Use c;>f the proletan!jt.
In either case This argument touches upon questions which must be examined .
in connection with the relation between politics and economics during the "withering away" of the state.
(This is dealt with in the next chapter.
) These questions are: the transform~ti011 of pub­ lic functions from political functions into simple functions of ad~ ministration, and the "political state.
" This last term, particularly liable to cause misunderstanding, indicates the process of the withering away of the state: at a certain stage of its withering away the moribund state can be called a non-political state.
Again, the most remarkable thing in this passage from Engels is the way he states the case against the anarchists.
Social-Demo-crats, the would-be disciples of Engels, have discussed this ques-tion with the anarchists millions of times since 1873, but they have not discussed it as Marxists can and should.
The anarchist idea 0£ the abolition of the state is muddled and non-revolutiorwry -that is how Engels put it.
It is precisely the revolution, in its rise and development, with its specific tasks in relation to violence, authority, power, the state, that the anarchists do not wish to see.
-~----The usual criticism of anarchism by present-day Social-Demo­ crats has been reduced to the purest philistine banality: "We rec­ ognise the state, whereas the anarchists do not!" Naturally, such banality cannot but repel revolutionary workers who think at all.
Engels says something di:ff erent.
He emphasises the fact that all socialists recognise the disappearance of the state as a result of the socialist revolution.
He then deals with the concrete question of the revolution-the very question which, as a rule, the Social­ Democrats, becaus.
e of their opportunism, evade, and leave, so to speak, exclusively for the anarchists "to work out.
" And in putting the question, Engels takes the bull by the horns; he asks: should not the Commune have made more use of the revolutionary power of the state, i.
e.
, of the armed proletariat organised as the rul-ing class? · .
Prevailing official Social-Deroocracy usually dismissed the question.
of the .
concrete tasks of the proletariat in the revolu­ .
tion ~ithe~ with a philistine sneer, or, at best, with the evasiv~ sophism, "~ait and see.
" And the anarchists were thus justified in sayin~ about sµch SociaJ·D1?mocr,acr that it had betrayed it;; t11s~ the experience of the last proletarian revolution precisely for the purpose of making a very concret~.
study of what the proletariat should do in relation to the hanks and the state, and how it should do it.

LETTER TO BEBEL One of the most remarkable, if not the most remarkable oh·.

, thirty-six years after it had been written and mailed.
Engels wrote to Behel criticising the very draft of the Gotha Programme which Marx also criticised in his famous letter to Bracke.
Referring particularly to the question of the state, Engels said: " .
•.
The free people's state is transformed into the free state.
Taken in its grammatical sense a free state is one· where the state is free in relation to its citizens and is.
therefore a state with a de•potic government.
The whole talk about the state should be dropped, especially since the Commune which was no longer a state in the proper sense of the word.
The 'people's st~te' has been thrown in our faces by the anarchists too long although Marx's book against Proudhon and later The Communist Manifesto directly declare that with the introduction of the socialist order of society the state will dissolve of itself [sich au/lost] and disappear.
As therefore the 'state' is only a transi· tional institut~on which is used in the struggle, in the revolution, in order to hold down [niederzuhalten] one's adversaries by force, it is pure nonsense to talk of a 'free people's state'; so long as the proletariat still uses the state it does not use it in the interests of freedom but in order to hold down its ad~er­ saries, and as soon as it becomes po"sible to speak of freedom, the state, as such, ceases to exist.
We would, therefore, propose to replace the word 'state' -eve;ywhere by the word Gemeinwesen [community], a good old German word, whrch can very well represent the French word 'commzine.

The bourgeoisie will praise them for 1t.
But we shall go on with ·our work.
In revising the programme of our Party we must unfailingly take the advice of.
Engels and Marx into consideration in order to come nearer the truth, t9 re· store Marxism by purging it of distortions, to guide the struggl~ of the working class for its emancipation more correctly.
Certamly no Bolshevik will he found who opposes the advice of Engels and Marx.
The only difficulty that may, perhaps, arise will he in .
re· gard to terminology.
In German there are two words meanmg "community,"1 of which Engels used the one which does not d~­ note a single commuriity, hut the totality, the system of commum· ties.
In Russian there is no such word, and perhaps we may have to decide to qse the French word "commune," although th15 also has its drawbacks.
·~The Commune, which was no longer a state in the proper sense of the word"-this is Engels' most important theoretical statement.
After what has been said above, this statement i~ per~ fectly clear.
The Commune ceased to be a st~te in so far as .

itself came on the scene.
All this is a departure from the state m the proper sense of the word.
And had the Commune lasted, all trac~s of the state in it would have "withered away" of themselves; 1t would not have been necessary for it to "abolish" the institutions 1 Gemeinde and Gemeinwesen.

"The people's state has been thrown in our faces by the anar' chists.
" In saying this, Engels had Bakunin and his attacks on the German Social-Democrats particularly in mind.
Engels admitted that these attacks were justified in so far as the "people's state" was as much an absurdity and as much a departure from social­ ism as the "free pe?ple's state.
" Engels tried to put the struggle o! the German S~cial-Democrats against the anarchists on right Imes, to make this struggle correct in principle, to purge it of opport~nist prejudices concerning the "state.
" Alas! Engels' letter was pigeonholed for thirty-six years.
We shall see below that even after Engels' letter was published, Kautsky obstinately re: peated what in essence were the very mistakes against which• En-gels had uttered his warning.
· · .
Be~el replied to Engels in a letter, dated September 21, 1875; m which he wrote, inter alia, that he "fully agrees" with Engels' criticism of the draft programme, and that he had reproached Liebknecht for his readiness to make concessions ( p.
304 of the German edition of Behel's Memoirs, Vol.
II).
But if we take Behel's pamphlet, Unsere Ziele,1 we find there arguments on the state that are absolutely wrong.
"The state must be transformed from one based on class rule into a pe<>ple's state.
" · This is printed in the ninth (the ninth!) edition of Behel's pamph~et! _It is not surprising that such persistently repeated op­ portumst views on the state were absorbed by German Social­ Democracy, especially as Engels' revolutionary interpretations were safely pigeonholed, and all the conditions of everyday life were such as· to "wean" the people from revolution for a long time! .

CRITICISM OF T:t=rE DRAFT OF THE ERFURT PROGRAMME In examining the Marxian doctrine of the state, the criticism of the draft of the Erfurt Programme sent by Engels to Kautsky 1 Unsere Ziele (Our Goal), Ger~an edition, 1886, p.
14.
Neue · Zeit, cannot be ignored; for this criticism is mainly con-· cerned with the opportunist views of Soc~al~Democracy on qiles~ tions of state structure.
We shall note in passing that Engels also makes an exceedingly valuable observation on questions of economics, which shows how attentively and thoughtfully he watched the changes in modern capitalism, and how he was· able to foresee to a certain extent the tasks of our own, the imperialist, epoch.
Here is the passage: re· ferring to the word "planlessness" (Planlosigkeit) used in the draft programme, as characteristic of capitalism, Engels writes: "When we pass from joint-stock companies to trusts which control and monopolise whole branches of industry, it is not only private production that ceases, hut also planlessness,.
'' 1 Here we have what is most essential in the theoretical appraisal of the latest phase of capitalism, i.
e.
, imperialism, viz.
, that cap­ italism becomes monopoly capitalism.
The latter must he empha­ sised because the erroneous bourgeois reformist view that monopo· -ly capitalism or state monopoly capitalism is no longer capitalism, but can already be termed· "state .
socialism," or something of that sort, is very widespread.
The trusts, of course, have not created, do not create now, and cannot create full and complete planning.
But to whatever extent they do plan, to whatever extent the capital­ ist magnates calculate in advance the volume of production on a national and even on an international scale, and to whatever extent they systematically regulate it, we still remain under capitalism­ capitalism in its new stage, it is true, hut still, undoubtedly, capital­ ism.
The "proximity" of such capitalism to socialism should serve the genuine representatives.
of the proletariat as proof of the proxi· mity, ease, feasibility and urgency of the socialist revolution, and not as an argument in favour of tolerating the repudiation of such a revolution or in favour of making capitalism look more attrac­ tive, an occupation in which all the reformists are engaged.
But let us return to the question of the state.
In this letter En­ gels makes three valuable suggestions: first, as regards the re-1 N eue Zeit, Vol.
XX, 1, 1901-02, p.
8.
as regards the connection between the national question and the form of state, and, third, as regards local self.
government.
-.
As regards the republic, Engels' made this the centre of gravity of his criticism of the draft of the Erfurt Programme.
And when we remember what importance the Erfurt Programme has ac­ quired in the whole of international Social-Democracy, that it has become the model for the whole of the Second International, it may-be said without exaggeration that· Engels thereby criticised the opportunism of the whole Second International.
Engels writes: "The political demands of the draft have one great fault.
What actually ought to b~ said is not there .
.
.
.
" (Engels' italics.
) 1 And, later on, he makes it clear that the German constitution is but a copy of the very reactionary constitution of 1850; that the Reichst'lg is only, as Wilhelm Liebknecht put it, "the fig-leaf of absolutism"; and that to wish "to transform all the instruments of labour into public property" on the basis of a constitution which legalises the existence of petty states and the federation of ·petty· German states is an "obvious absurdity.
" "To touch on that is dangerous, however," Engels adds, know· ing full well that it is impossible, for reasons of legality, to in­ clude in the programme the demand for a republic in Germany.
But Engels does not rest content with this obvious argument which satisfied "everybody.
" He continue~: "And yet somehow or other the thing has got to be attacked .
.
•.
How necessary this is is shown precisely at the present time by the inroads which opportunism is making in a great section of the Social-Democratic press.
For fear of a revival of the Anti-Socialist Law and from recollection of all manner of premature utterances which were let fall during the reign of that law the present legal position of the Party in Germany is now all of a sudden to be treated as sufficient for the carrying out of all the demands of the Party by peaceful means.
" 1 · Engels particularly stresses the fundamental fact that the Ger­ man Social-Democrats were prompted by fear of a revival of the Anti-Socialist Law,* and unhesitatingly calls this opportunism; 1 Ibid.

freedC>m in Germany, the dreams of a "peaceful" path were abso­ lutely absurd.
Engels is sufficiently careful not to tie his hands.
He admits-·that in republican or very free countries "one can con­ ceive" (only "conceive"!) of a peaceful development towards socialism,-but in Germany; he repeats, "in Germany, where the government is almost almighty and the Reichstag and all other representative bodies have no real power, to proclaim such a thing in Germany-and moreover when there is no need to do so-iS to re­ move the fig-leaf from absolutism, and use it to screen one's own nakedness.
" 1 The great majority of the official leaders of the German Social­ Democratic Party, who pigeonholed this adviCe, have indeed proved to be a screen for absolutism.
"Ultimately such a policy can only lead one's own party astray.
General abstract political questions have been put into the foreground, concealing thus the immediate concrete questions, the questions which at the first great events, the first political crisis, put themselves on the agenda.
What can result.
from this except that at the decisive moment the ·Party is suddenly left without guidance, that unclarity and disunity reign on the most decisive points because these points have never been discussed? ••.
"This forgetfulness of the great main standpoint in the momentary interests of the day, this struggling and striving for the success of the moment without consideration for the later consequences, this sacrifice of the future of the movement for its present may be 'honestly' meant, but it is and remains op­ portunism, and 'honest' opportunism is perhaps the most dangerous of all .
.
.
.
"If one thing is certain it is that our Party and the working class can only come to power under the form of the democratic republic.
This is even the specific form for the dictatorship of the proletariat, as the Great French Revo­ lution has already shown .
.
.
.
" 1 Engels repeats here in a particularly striking manner the fundamental idea which runs like a red thread through all of Marx's works, namely, that the democratic republic is the nearest approach to the dictatorship of the proletariat.
For such a repub­ lic-:-without in -the least abolishing the domination of capital, and, therefore, the oppressl.
on of the masses and the class struggle-­ inevitably leads to such an extension, development, unfolding and intensificati9n of that struggle that, as soon as the possibility arises of satisfying the fundamental interests of the oppressed 1 lbid.
-Ed.
Eng.
ed.
masses, this possibility is achieved inevitably and, solely in the dictatorship of the proletariat, in the leadership of those masses by the.
proletariat.
These, too, are "forgotten words" of Marxism for the whole of the Second International, and this forgetfulness was demonstrated with particular vividness by the history of the Menshevik Party in the first half year of the Russian Revolution of 1917.
On the question of a federal republic, in connection with the national composition of the population, Engels wrote: "What should take its place?" (of present-day Germany with its reactionary monarchical constitution and its equally reactionary division into petty states, which perpetuates all the specific features of "Prussianism" instead of dis­ solving them in Germany as a whole).
"In my view, the proletariat can only use the form of one and indivisible republic.
In the gigantic territory of the United States a federal republic is still, on the whole, a necessity, although in the Eastern states it is already becoming a hindrance.
It would be a step for­ ward in England, where the two islands are peopled by four nations and in spite of a single Parliament three different systems of legislation exist side by side even today.
* In little Switzerland, it has long been a hindrance, tolerable only because Switzerland is content to be a purely passive member of the European state system.
For Germany, federation of the Swiss type would be an enormous step backward.
Two points distinguish a federal state from a unitary state: first, that each separate federated state, each canton, has its own civil and criminal legislative and judicial system, and, second, that along­ side of a popular chamber there is also a federal chamber in which each can­ ton, large or small, votes as such.
" 1 In Germany the federal state is the transitional stage to the complete unitary state, and the "revolution from above" of 1866 and 1870** must not be reversed but supplemented by a "move­ ment from below.
" Engels did not display indifference to the question of the forms of state; on the contrary, he tried to analyse the transitional forms with the utmost care in order to establish, in accordance with the concrete, historical, specific features of each separate case, from what and into what the given transitional form is evolving.
From the point of view of the proletariat and the proletarian revolution, Engels, like Marx, insisted on democratic centralism, on one indivisible republic.
He regarded the federal republic lfbid.
-Ed.
an exception and a hindrance to development, or as a transitional form from a monarchy to a centralised republic, as a "step forward" under certain special conditions.
And in these special conditions, the national question comes to the front.
In spite of their ruthless criticism of the reactionary nature of small states, and, in certain concrete cases, the screening of this by the national question, Engels and Marx never betrayed a trace of a desire to evade the national question-a desire of which the Dutch and Polish Marxists are often guilty, as a result of their very justifiable opposition to the narrow philistine nationalism of "their" little states.
Even in regard to England, where geographical conditions, a common language and the history of many centuries would seem to have "put an end" to the national question in the separate small divisions of England-even in regard to this country, En­ gels took into account the patent fact that the national question had not yet been settled, and recognised in consequence that the establishment of a federal republic would be a "step forward.
" Of course, there is not a trace here of an attempt to abandon the criticism of the defects of a federal republic or the most de­ termined propaganda and struggle for · a united and centralised democratic republic.
But Engels did not interpret democratic centralism in the bureaucratic sense in which this term is used by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologists, including the anarchists.
His inter· pretation did not in the least preclude such wide local self-govern· ment.
as would combine the voluntary defence of the unity of the state by the "communes" and districts with the complete abolition of all bureaucracy and all "ordering" from above.
Enlarging on the.
programme views of Marxism on the st.
ate, Engels wrote: "So, then, a unitary republic-but not in the sense of the present French Republic, which is nothing but the Empire established in 1798 minus the Emperor.
From 1792 to 1798 each Department of France, each commune [Ge­ meinde], enjoyed complete self-government on the American model, and this is what we too must have.
* How self-government is to be organised and how we can manage without a bureaucracy has been shown by America and the first French Republic, and is being shown even today by Australia, Canada and the other English colonies.
And a provincial and local self-government of 5• federated state as a whole)' but is also independent in relation to the district and the commune~ The cantonal governments appoint the' district governors [Bezirksstatthalter] and prefects-a feature which is unknown in English-speaking countries and which we shall have to abolish here in the future along with the Prussian Landrate and Regierungsrate" (commissaries, district police chiefs, governors, and in general all officials appointed from above) •1 Accordingly, Engels proposes the following wording for the Clause in the programme on self-government: · "Complete self-government for.
the provinces" (districts and communities) "through officials elected by universal suffrage.
The abolition of all local and provincial authorities appointed by the state.
" I have already had occasion :to point out-"-in Pravda (No.
68, June 10, 1917), which was suppressed by the government of Kerensky and other "Socialist" Ministers**-how in this connection (of course, not only in this connection by any means) our alleged Socialist representatives of alleged-revolutionary alleged-democracy have departed from democracy in the most scandalous manner.
Na· turally, people who have bound themselves by a "coalition" with the imperialist bourgeoisie have remained deaf to this criticism.
It is extremely important to note that Engels, armed with facts, disproves by a precise example the prejudice that is very widespread, particularly among petty-bourgeois democrats, that a federal republic necessarily means a greater amount of freedom than a centralised republic.
This is not true.
It is disproved by the facts cited by Engels regarding the centralised French Re­ public of 1792-98 and the federal Swiss Republic.
The really democratic centralised republic gave more freedom than the fed­ eral republic.
In other words, the greatest amount of local, provincial and other freedom known in history was granted by a centralised and not by a federal republic.
Insufficient attention has been and is being paid to this fact in our Party propaganda and agitation, as, indeed, to the whole question of federal and centralised republics and local self-govern­ ment.

War in France (this Introduction is dated March 18, 1891, and was origin­ ally published, in Neue Zeit), Engels, in addition to many other interesting incidental remarks on questions connected with the atti­ tude to be taken towards the state, gives a remarkably striking resume of the lessons of.
the Commune.
This resume, which was rendered more -profound by the entire experience of the twenty years that separated the author from the Commune, and which was di­ rected particularly against the "superstitious belief in the state" so widespread in Germany, can justly be called the last word of Marxism on the question dealt with here.
fo France, Engels observes, the workers were armed after every revolution; " .
.
.
therefore the disarming of the workers was the first commandment for the bourgeois at the helm of the state.
Hence after every.
revolution won by the workers, a new.
struggle, ending with the defeat of the workers.
" 1 This resume of the experience of bourgeois revolutions is as concise as it is expressive.
The essence of the matter-also, by the way, of the question of the state (has the oppressed class arms?)­ is here remarkably well defined.
It is precisely this essential thing which.
is most often ignored by professors, who are influenced by bourgeois ideology, as well as by petty-bourgeois democrats.
In the Russian Revolution of 1917, the honour (Cavaignac honour) of bia:bbing this secret of bourgeois revolutions fell to the Menshevik, "also-Marxist," TseretellL ln his "historic" speech of June 22, * Tseretelli blurted out the de.

d1 German Social-Democracy, in proportion as it decayed and became more and more opportunist, slipped more and more fre­ quently into the philistine misinterpretation of the celebrated formula: "Religion is a .
.
.
private matter.
" That is, this formula was twisted to mean that the question of religion was a private matter even for the party of the revolutionary proletariat! It was against this utter betrayal of the revolutionary programme of the proletariat that Engels protested.
In 1891 he saw only the very feeble beginnings of opportunism in his Party, and, therefore, he expressed himself on the subject very cautiously: " .
.
.
As almost without exception workers, or recognised representatives of the workers, sat in the Commune, its decisions bore a decidedly proletarian character.
Either they decreed reforms which the republican bourgeoisie had failed to pass solely out of cowardice, but which provided a necessary basis for the free activity of the working class--such as the realisation of the prin­ ciple that in relation to the state religion is a purely private matter-or they promulgated decrees which were in the direct interests of the working class and to some extent cut deeply into the old order of society.
" 1 Engels deliberately emphasised the words "in relation to the state," as a etraight thrust at the heart of German opportunism, which had declared religion to be a private matter in relation to the Party, thus degrading the party of the revolutionary proletariat to the level of the most vulgar "free-thinking" philistinism, which is prepared to allow a non-denominational status, but which re­ nounces the Party struggle against the religious opium which stupefies the people.
The future historian of German Social-Democracy, in investi­ gating the basic causes of its shameful collapse in 1914,* will find no lack of interesting material on this question, from the evasive declarations in the articles of the ideological leader of the Party, Kautsky, which opened wide the door to opportunism, to the attitude of the Party towards the Los-von-Kirche Bewegung (the "leave the church" movement) in 1913.
But let us see how, twenty years after the Commune, Engels summed.

"Against this transformation of the state and the orgaI1s of the s~ate.

And: in the second pl~ce, all officials, high or low, were paid only the wages received by other ;vorker_s.

' But Engels did not make the mistake some Marx~sts make in dealing, for example, with the right of nations to self-determina­ tion, i.
e.
, argue that this is impossible under capitalism and will be unnecessary under socialism.
* Such a seemingly clever but really incorrect statement might be made in regard to any demo­ cratic institution, including moderate salaries for officials; because fully consistent democracy is impossible under capitalism, and under socialism all democracy withers away.
It is a sophism that is similar to the old humorous problem: will a man become bald if he loses one more hair? To develop democracy to its logical conclusion, to find the forms for this development, to test them by practice, and· so forth-all this is one of the constituent tasks of the struggle for the social revolution.
Taken separately, no sort of democracy will bring socialism.
But in actual life democracy will never be "taken separately"; it will be "taken together" with other things, it will exert its influence on economics, will stimulate its reformation; and in its turn it will be influenced by economic development, a.
"ld so on.
Such are the dialectics of living history.
· Engels continues: ' "This blowing up [Sprengung] of the former state power and its replace-.
ment.
by a new and really democratic state is described in detail in the third section of T~e Civil War.
But it was necessary to dwell briefly here once more· o_n s?me of its feature.

has been carried over -from.
philosophy into the general con­ sc1?usnes~ of the_ bourgeoisie and even of many workers.

" 1 Enaels warned the Germans not to forget the fundamentals of b socialism .
on the questio!l of the state in general in connection with the substitution of a republic for the monarchy.
His warnings now read like a lecture to Messrs.
Tseretelli and Chernov, who in their coalition practice revealed a superstitious belief in and a superstitious rever" ence for the state! Two more points.
First: the fact that Engels said that in a democratic republic ''no less" than in a monarchy, the state re--' .
'' mains a "machine for the oppression of one class by another does ·not signify that the form of oppression is a matter of in­ difference to the proletariat, as some anarchists "teach.
" A wider, freer and mo~e open form of the class struggle and of class oppression greatly assists the proletariat in its struggle for tl;ie ----­ abolition of all classes.
Second: why will only a new generatfon be able to throw all the useless lumber of the state on the scrap-heap? This question is bound up with the question of overcoming democracy, with which we shall deal now.

Never mind, it will "pass muster," if only the party develops, if only the scientific inexactness of its name is not hidden from it and does not hinder its development in the right direction! Perhaps some humourist will begin consoling us Bolsheviks in the manner of Engels: we have a genuine party, it is developing ·splendidly; even such a meaningless and ugly term as "Bolshevik" will "pass muster," although it expresses nothing but the purely accidental fact that at the Brussels-London Congress of 1903 we were in the majority.
1 ••• Perhaps, now that the persecution of our Party by republican and "revolutionary" petty-bourgeois demo· cracy in July and August has made the name "Bolshevik" such a universally respected one; that, in addition, this persecution signalises the great historical progress our Party has made in its actual development, even I would hesitate to insist on the sug­ gestion I made in April to change the name of our Party.
* Perhaps I would propose a "compromise" to our comrades, viz.
, to call ourselves the Communist Party, but to retain the word "Bolshe-viks'' in brackets.
.
.
.
.
But the question of the name 0£ the Party is incomparably less important than the question of tlie attitude 0£ the revolutionary proletariat to the state.
In the arguments usually advanced about the state, the mistake is constantly made against which Engels uttered his warning and · 1 The word for "majority" in Russian is "bolshinstvo," hence the word "Bolshevik.
" The word for "minoFity" in Russian is "menshinstvo," hence t4e word "Menshevik.

ed,, that the abolition of the state means also the abolition of democracy; that the withering away 0£ the state means the wither­ ing away 0£ democracy.
At first sight this assertion seems exceedingly strange and in­ comprehensible; indeed, someone may even begin to £ear that we are expecting the advent of an order 0£ society in which the principle 0£ the subordination 0£ the minority to the majority will not he respected-for is not democracy the recognition 0£ this principle? No, democracy is not identical with the subordination of the minority to the majority.
Democracy is a state which recognises the subordination of the minority to the majority, i.
e.
, an organ­ isation for the systematic use of violence by one class against the other, by one section 0£ the population against another.
We set ourselves the ultimate aim of abolishing the state, i.
e.
, all organised and systematic violence, all use of violence against man in general.
We do not expect the advent 0£ an order 0£ society in which the principle 0£ the subordination 0£ the minority to the majority will not be observed.
But in striving for socialism we are convinced that it will develop into communism and, hence, that the need for violence against people in general, the need for the subjection 0£ one man to another, and 0£ one section 0£ the popula­ tion to another, will vanish, since people will become accustomed to observing the elementary conditions 0£ social life without force and without subordination.
In order to emphasise this element 0£ habit, Engels speaks of a new generation, "reared in new and free social conditions " which "will be able to throw the entire lumber 0£ the state"-~£ every kind 0£ state, including even the democratic-republican state-"on the scrap-heap.
" In order to explain this it is necessary to examine the question .
0£ the economic basis 0£ the withering away 0£ the state.
CHAPTER V THE ECONOMIC BASIS OF THE WITHERING AWAY OF THE STATE MARX explains this question most -thoroughly in his Critique of the_ Gotha Programme (letter to Bracke,_ May 5, 1875, printed only in 1891, in N eue Zeit, Vol.
IX, 1, and in a special Russian edition).
The polemical part of this remarkable work, consisting of a criti­ cism of Lassalleanism, has, so to speak, overshadowed its positive part, ~amely, the analysis of the conn'ection between the deveiop­ ment of communism and the withering away of the state.
l.
MARX'S PRESENTATION OF THE QUESTION From a superficial comparison of Marx's letter to Bracke (May 5, 1875) with Engels' letter to Behel (March 28, 187-5),.
which we examined above, it might appear that Marx was much more "pro-state" than Engels, and that the difference of opinion between the two writers on the question of the state was very considerable.
Engels suggested· to Behel that all the chatter about· the state be dropped; that the word "state" be -eliminated from the pro­ gramme and ~the word "community'' substituted for it.
Engels even declared that the Commune was really _no longer a state in _the proper sense of the word, while Marx spoke of the "future st11te in _commupist society/' .
i.
e,, apparently he recognised the need.
for a state even under communism.
But such a -view would be fundamentally· wrong.
A -closer ex­ amination shows that Marx's and Engels' views on the state and its withering away were completely identical, and that Marx's expression quoted above refers merely to this withering aivay of the state.
-Clearly, there can be n,;; question of defining the exact mQment .
'16 and Engels is due to the different subjects they dealt with, the different aims they were pursuing.
Engels set out to show Behel ·plainly, sharply and in broad outline the absurdity of the pre­ vailing prejudices concerning the state, shared to no small degree by Lassalle.
Marx, on the other hand, only touched upon this question in passing, being interested mainly in_ another subject, viz;, the development Qf communist society--The whole theory of Marx is an application of the theory of development-in its most consistent, complete, thought-out _and replete form-to modern capitalism.
It· was natural for Marx to raise the ·question of applying this theory both to the forthcoming collapse of capitalism and to the future development of future communism.
On the basis of what data can the question of the future de­ velopment of future communism be raised? On the basis of the fact that it has its origin in capitalism, that it develops historically from capitalism, that it is the result of lhe­ action of a social force to which capitalism has given birth.
There is no trace of an attempt on Marx's part to conjure up a utopia, to· make idle guesses· about what cannot be known.
Marx treats the question of communism in the same way as a naturalist would treat the question of the development of, say, a new biological species, if he knew that such and such was its origin, and such and such the direction in which it was changing.
Marx, first of all, brushes aside the confusion the Gotha Pro­ gramme brings into the question of the relation between state and society.
He writes: "'Present-day society' is capitalist society, which exists in all civilised countries, more or less free from medireval admixture, more or less modified hx the special historical development of each country and more or less devel­ oped.
On the.
other hand the 'present-day state' .
changes with a country's fron.
-tier.
It is different in the Prusso-German Empire from what it is in Switzer­ land, it is different in England from what it is in the United States.
'The j:iresentcday state' is ·therefore a fiction.
"Nevertheless the different states of the different civilised countries, in spite of their varied diversity of form, all have this in common that they are based on modern bourgeois society, only one more or less capitalistically de-fut~e, m whi~h its presei;t root, bourgeois society, will have died away.
The.
quest~on ~hen arises: what tran~ormation will the state undergo in commumst society.
In other words, what-social functions will remain in exist­ e.
nce there that are analogou~ to .
the present functions of the state? This ques­ tion can only be answered scientifically and one does not get a fiea-hop nearer to tdhe problem by a thousand-fold combination of the word people with the wor state.
" 1 Having thus ridi?uled all talk about a "people's state," Marx form~lates the question and warns us, as it were, that to arrive at a .
sc1~nti:fic answer one must rely only on firmly established scientific data.
, The first fact that has been established with complete exactitude ny the whole theory of development, by science as a whole--a fact which th~ utopians forgot,.
and which is forgotten by present-day o~por~unlSts who are afraid of the socialist revolution~is that, h1sto~1?ally, there must undoubtedly be a special stage or epoch of transition from capitalism to communism.
2.
THE TRANSITION FROM CAPITALISM TO COMMUNISM Marx continues: I -"<~-' -,--,,,, -.
"Between capit~list and communist society lies the period of the revolu­ t10na~~ transfon;n~t10n o~ the.
one into the other.
There corresponds to this also a.
political_ trans1tI?n period m which the state can be nothing but the revolu­ tionury dictatorship of the proletariat.
" 1 .
Marx bases .
this.
conclusion on an analysis of the role played by ~e proletariat m modern capitalist society, on the data con-.
~rnmg the development of this society, and on the irreconcilabil­ ity .
o~ the antagonistic interests of the proletariat and the bour­ geoisie.
.
Earlie~ th~ question was put in this way: in order to achieve its emancip~t~on, the proletariat must overthrow the bourgeoisie, conque~ political power and establish its own revolutionary dic­ tatorship.
Now the question is put somewhat differently: the transition 1 Critique of the Gotha Programme.

tion period," and the state in this period can only be the revolu­ tionary dictatorship of the proletariat.
What, then, is the relation of this dictatorship to democ-racy? We have seen that The Communist Manifesto simply places the two ideas side by side: "to raise the proletariat to the position of the ruling class" and "to win the battle of democracy.
" On the basis of all that has been said above, it is possible to determine more precisely how democracy changes in the transition from capitalism to communism.
In capitalist society, under the conditions most favourable to its development, we have more or less complete democ;racy in the democratic republic.
But this democracy is always restricted by the narrow framework of capitalist exploitation, and consequently always remains, in reality, a democracy for the minority, only for the possessing clas~s, only for the rich.
Freedom in capitalist society always remains about the same as it was in the ancient Greek republics: freedom for the slave-owners.
Owing to the con­ ditions of capitalist exploitation the modem wage-slaves are also so crushed by want and poverty that "they cannot be bothered with democracy," "they cannot be bothered with politics"; in the ordin­ ary peaceful course of events the majority of the population is debarred from participating in social and political life.
The correctness of this statement is perhaps most clearly proved by Germany, precisely because in that country constitutional legal­ ity lasted and remained stable for a remarkably long time~for nearly half a century (1871-1914)-and because during this pe­ riod Social-Democracy was able to achieve far more in Germany than in other countries in the way of "utilising legality," and was able to organise a larger proportion of the working class into a political party than anywhere else in the world.
What is this largest proportion of politically conscious and active wage-slaves that has so far been observed in capitalist society? One million members of the Social-Democratic Party-', ,1' trade unions-out of fifteen million! 1 -.
Democracy for an insignificant minority, democracy for the rich-that is the democracy.
of capitalist society.
If we look more closely into the mechanism of capitalist democracy, everywhere, in the "petty"-so-called petty-details of the suffrage (residential qualification, exclusion of women, etc.
)' and in the technique of the representative institutions, in the actual obstacles lo the right of assembly (public buildings are not for "beggars"!), in the purely capitalist organisation of the daily press, etc.
, etc.
-on all sides we see restriction after restriction upon democracy.
These restrictions, exceptions, exclusions, obstacles for the poor, seem slight, especially in the eyes of one who has never known want himself and has never been in close contact with the oppressed classes in their mass life (and nine-tenths, H not ninety-nine hundredths, of the bourgeois publicists and politicians are of this category) ; but ·in their sum total these restrictions exclude and squeeze out the poor from politics, from taking an active part in democracy.
Marx grasped this essence of capitalist democracy splendidly; when, in analysing the experience of the Commune, he said that the oppressed were allowed, once every few years, to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class should mis­ represent them in parliament! But from this capitalist democracy-inevitably narrow, tacitly repelling the poor, and therefore hypocritical and false to the core-development does not proceed simply, smoothly and dire~t­ ly to "greater and greater democracy," as the liberal professors and petty-bourgeois opportunists would have us believe.
No, de­ velopment-towards communism-proceeds through the· dictator­ ship of the proletariat; it cannot do otherwise, for the resistance of the capitalist exploiters cannot be broken by anyone else or in any other way.
But the dictatorship of the proletariat, i.

an expansion of democracy.
Simultaneously with ~ immense expansion· of democracy which for the first time .
becomes democracy for the poor,.
democr:cy for the people, and not democra~y for the rich, the d1ctatorsh1p of the proletariat imposes a series of restrictions on the freedom o~ the oppressors, the exploiters, the capitalists.
We mu.
st crush them m order to free humanity from wage-slavery; their resistance must be broken by force; it is clear that where there is suppression there is also violence, there is no freedom, no democracy.
Engels expressed this splendidly in his letter to Behel when he said, as the reader will remember, that "so long as the proI~tariat still uses the state it does not use .
it in the inter· ests of freed~m but m order to hold down its adversaries, and-as soon a5 it becomes possible to speak of freedom the state as such ceases to exist.
" 1 · Democr~cy for the vast majority of the people, and suppression by force, i.
e.
, exclusion from democracy, of the exploiters and opp:essors of th~ ?eople-this is the change democracy undergoes durmg the transition from capitalism to communism.
.
Only in communist society, when the resistance of the capital· 1sts has been completely broken, when the capitalists have dis­ appeared, when there are no classes (i~e.
, when there is no dif­ ference .
between the members of society as regards their relation to the social means of production), only then does "the state • • • cease to exist," and it "becomes possible to speak of freedom.
" Only t?en will really complete democracy, democracy without any excepti.
ons, be p~ssible and be realised.
And only then will demo­ cracy itself begm to wither away owing to the simple fact that freed f_r?m capit~list s!avery, from the untold horrors, savagery: absurdities and mfannes of capitalist exploitation, people will gradu:lly _become accustomed to observing the elementary rules of social hfe that have been known for centuries and repeated for thousands of years in all copy-book maxims; they will become ac· c~stomed to o?ser~ing them without force, without compulsion, .
without subordmat10n, without the special apparatus for compul­ sion which is called the state.

6 is very well chosen, for it indicates both the gradual and the spontaneous nature of the process.
Only habit can, and ~ndouhtedly will, have such an effect; for we see around us millions of times how readily people become accustomed to observing the necessary rules of social life if there is no exploitation, if there is nothing that causes indigna­ tion, that calls forth protest and revolt and has to be suppressed.
Thus, in capitalist society we have a democracy that is cur­ tailed, wretched, false; a democracy only for the rich, for the minority.
The dictatorship of the proletariat, the period of transi­ tion to communism, will, for the first time, create democracy for the people, for the majority, in addition to the necessary suppres­ sion of the minority-the exploiters.
Communism alone is capable of giving really complete democracy, and the more complete it is the more quickly will it become unnecessary and wither away of itself.
In other words: under capitalism we have a state in the proper sense of the word, that is, a special machine for the suppression of one class by another, and of the majority by the minority at that.
Naturally, the successful discharge of such a task as the systematic suppression of the exploited majority by the exploiting minority calls for the greatest ferocity and savagery in the work of suppression, it calls for seas of blood through which mankind has to wade in slavery, serfdom and wage-labour.
Furthermore, during the transition from capitalism to com· munism, suppression is still necessary; hut it is the suppression of the exploiting minority by the exploited majority.
A special ap­ paratus, a special machine for suppression, the "state," is still necessary, but this is now a transitory state; it is no longer a state in the proper sense; for the suppression of the minority of ex­ ploiters by the majority of the wage-slaves of yesterday is com-.
paratively so easy, simple and natural a task that it will entail far less bloodshed than the suppression of the risings of slaves, serfs.
or wage-labourers, and it will cost mankind far less.
This is com· patible with the diffusion of democracy among such an over­ whelming majority of the population that the need for a special machine of suppression wilfbegin to disappear.
The exploiters are, naturally, unable to suppress the people without a very complex machine for performing this task; hut the people can suppress the exploiters with a very simple "machine," almost without a "machine," without a special apparatus, by the simple organisa­ tion of the armed masses (such as the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, we may remark, running ahead a little).
Finally, only communism makes the state absolutely unneces­ sary, for there is no one to be suppressed-"no one" in the seme of a class, in the sense of a systematic struggle against a definite section of the population.
We are not utopians, and we do not in "the least deny the possibility and inevitability of excesses on the part of individual persons, or the need to suppress such excesses.
· But, in the first place, no special machine, no special apparatus of repression is needed for this: this will be done by the armed people itself, as simply and as readily as any crowd of civilised people, even in modern society, parts two people who are fighting, or interferes to prevent a woman from being assaulted.
And, secondly, we know that the fundamental social cause of ex­ cesses, which consist in violating the rules of social life, is the exploitation of the masses, their want and their poverty.
With the removal of this chief cause, excesses will inevitably begin to "wither away.
" We do not know how quickly and ih what order, but we know that they will wither away.
With their withering away, the state will also wither away.
Without dropping into utopias, Marx defined more fully what can he defined now regarding this future, namely the difference between the lower and higher phases (degrees, stages) of com~ munist society.
3.
THE FIRST PHASE OF COMMUNIST SOCIETY In the Critique of the Gotha Programme, Marx goes into some detail to disprove Lassalle's idea that under socialism the worker will receive the "undiminished" or "whole proceeds of his labour.
" Marx shows that from the whole of the social labour of society it is necessary to deduct a reserve fund, a fund for the expansion of production, for the replacement of "worn-out" machinery, a·nd so on; then, also, from the means of consumption must he deducted a 6* fund for the expenses of management, for schools, hospitals, homes for the aged, and so on.
Instead of Lassalle's hazy, obscure, general phrase-"the whole proceeds of his labour to the worker"-Marx makes a sober esti­ mate of exactly how socialist society will have to manage its affairs.
Marx proceeds to make a concrete analysis of the con­ ditions of life of a society in which there is no capitalism, and says: "What we have to deal with here [in analysing the programme of the Party] is a communist society.
not as it has developed on its own foundations, but on the contrary as it emerges from capitalist society; which is thus in eve~ respect economically, morally and intellectually still stamped with the birth marks of the old society from whose womb it emerges.
" 1 And it is this communist society-a society which has just come into the world out of the womb of capitalism and which, in every respect, hears the birth marks of the old society-that Marx terms the "first," or lower, phase of communist society.
The means of production are no longer the private property of individuals.
The means of production belong to the whole of society.
Every member of society, performing a certain part of socially-necessary labour, receives a certificate from society to the effect that he has done such and such an amount of work.
Accord­ ing to this certificate, he receives from the public warehouse;;, where articles of consumption are stored, a corresponding quantity of products.
Deducting that proportion of labour which goes to the public fund, every worker, therefore, receives from society as much as he has given it.
"Equal right" seems to reign supreme.
But when Lassalle, having such a social order in view (gen­ erally called socialism, hut termed by Marx the first phase of communism), speaks of this as "equitable distribution," and says that this is "the equal right" of "all members of society" to "equal proceeds of labour," he is mistaken, and Marx exposes his error.
"Equal right," says Marx, we indeed have here; hut it is still a "bourgeois right," which, like every right, presupposes inequal-1 Critique of the Gotha Programme.

people who, in fact, are not the s~me and ar~ no~ equal to o;:ie another· that is why "equal right" IS really a v10lat10n of equality and an injustice.
As a matter of fact, every man having performed as much social labour as another receives an equal share of the social product (less the above-mentioned deductions) .
.
.
But people are not alike: one is strong, a~other IS weak; one is married, another is not; one has more children, another has less, and so on.
And the conclusion Marx draws is: " .
•• with an equal output and hence an equal share in t~e socia~ consu~ption fund, one will in fact receive more than anothe~, one.
will be nche; than an·.
other and so on.
To avoid all these defects, nght, mstead of bemg equal, would have to be unequal.

production, the factories, machines, land, etc.
, as private property.
____ _ In smashing Lassalle's petty-bourgeois, confused phrases about "equality" and "justice" in general, Marx shows t~e course of development of communist society, which, at first, is compelled to abolish only the "injustice" of the means of production having been seized by private individuals and which cannot at once abolish the other injustice of the distribution of _articles of con­ sumption "according to the amount of work performed" (and not according to needs).

But the state has not yet completely withered away, since there still remains the protection of "bourgeois right" which sanctifies actual inequality.
For the complete withering away of the state, complete communism is necessary.
4.
THE HIGHER PHASE OF COMMUNIST SOCIETY Marx continues: "In a higher phase of communist society after the enslaving subordination of individuals under division of labour, and therewith also the antithesis he· tween mental and physical labour, has vanished; after labour has become not merely a means to live but has .
become itself the primary necessity of life; after the productive forces have also increased with the all-round development of the individual, and all the springs of co-operative we_ahh flow more abun­ dantly-only then can the narrow horizon of bourgeois right be 'fully left behind and society inscribe on its banners: from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs! " 1 Only now can we appreciate to the full the correctness of Engels' remarks in which he mercilessly ridiculed the absurdity of combining the words "freedom" and "state.
" While the state exists there is no freedom.
When freedom exists, there will he· no state.
The economic basis for the· complete withering away of the state is the high stage of development of communism in which the antithesis between mental and physical labour disappears, that is to say, when one of the principal sources of modern social in­ equality-a source, moreover, which cannot he removed immedi­ ately by the mere conversion of the means of production into ·pub­ lic property, by the mere expropriation of the capitalist&-dis­ appears.
This expropriation will facilitate the enormous.
development of the productive forces.
And seeing how capitalism is ali:-eady retarding this development to an incredible degree, seeing ·how much progress could he achieved even on the basis of the present level of modern technique, w~ have a right to say with the fullest 1 lbid.
-Ed.
Eng.
ed.
result in the enormous development of the productive ·forces of human society.
But how rapidly this development will proceed, how soon it will reach the point of breaking away from the divi­ sion of labour, of removing the antithesis between mental and phys­ ical· labour, of transforming work into the "primary necessity of life"-we do not and cannot know.
That is why we have a right to speak only of the inev~table withering away of the state; we must emphasise the protracted na­ ture of this process and its dependence upon the rapidity of de­ velopment of the higher phase of communism; and we leave the question of length of time, or the concrete forms of the withering away, quite open, because no material is available to enable us to answer these questions.
The state will be able to wither away completely when society can apply the rule:.
"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs," i.
e.
, when people have become so accus­ tomed to observing· the fundamental rules of social life and when their labour is so productive that they will voluntarily work accord­ ing to their ability.
"The narrow horizon of bourgeois right," which compels one to calculate with the shrewdness of a Shylock whether he has not worked half an hour more than another, whether he is not getting less pay than another-this narrow horizon will then be left behind.
There will then he no need for society to make an exact calculation of the quantity of products to he distributed to e_ach of its members; each will take freely "according to his needs.
" .
From the bourgeois point of view, it is easy to declare such a social ordt:r to he "a pure utopia," and to sneer at the Socialists for promising everyone the right to· receive from society, without any.
control of the labour of the individual .
citizen, any quantity <;>f truffles, automobiles, pianos, etc.
Even now, most bourgeois _ "savants" make shift with such sneers, thereby displaying at once their ign.
orance and their selfish defence of capitalism.
Ignorance-for it has never entered the head of any Socialist to "promise" that the higher phase of communism will arrive· and the great Socialists, in foreseeing its arrival, presupposed : the present man in the street who, like the seminary students in · Pomyalovsky's story,1 is capable of damaging the stores of social wealth "just for fun," and of demanding the impossible.
.
Until the "higher" phase of communism arrives, the SocialiBts demand the strictest control, by society and by the state, of the amount of labour and the amount ·of consumption; hut this con­ trol must start with the expropriation of the capitalists, with the establishment of workers' control over the capitalists, and must -he carried out, not by a state of bureaucrats, but by a state of armed workers.
-.
The selfish defence of capitalism by the bourgeois ideologists (and their hangers-on, like Messrs.
Tseretelli, Chernov and Co.
) lies in their substituting controversies and discussions about the distant future for the essential imperative questions of present-day Policy viz.
the expropriation of the capitalists, the conversion of ' ' .
h " d" " .
all citizens into workers and employees of one uge syn icate -the whole state-and the complete subordination of the whole of -~ the work of this syndicate to the really democratic state of the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies •.
In reality, when a learned professor, and follo':ing him some philistine, and following the latter Messrs.
Tseretell~ and C~ernov, talk of the unreasonable utopias, of the demagogic promises of the Bolsheviks, of the impossibility of "introducing" socialism, it is the higher stage or phase of communism which they have in mind·.
and which no one has ever promised, or has even thought of "intr~ducing," because, generally speaking, it cannot he "intro-duced.
" .

some isolated anarchist, perhaps, could invest it with primary importance (if there are still any people among the anarchists who have learned nothing from the "Plekhanovist" conversion of tne Kropotkins, the Graveses, the Cornelisens and other "leading lights" of anarchism into social­ chauvinists or "anarcho-trenchists," as Ge, one of the few anarch-.
ists who has still preserved a sense of honour and a conscience, has expressed it).
* · But the scientific difference.
between socialism and communism · is clear.
What is generally called socialism was termed by Marx the "first" or lower phase of communist society.
In so far as the means of production become common property, the word "com­ munism" is also applicable here, providing we do not forget that it is not complete communism.
The great significance of Marx's explanations lies in that here, too, he consistently applies ma­ terialist dialectics, the theory of development, and regards com­ munism as something which develops out of capitalism.
Instead of scholastically invented, "concocted" definitions and fruitless disputes about words (what is socialism? what is communism?), Marx gives an analysis of what may be called stages in the econ­ omic ripeness of communism.
In its first phase, or first stage, communism cannot as yet be economically· ripe and entirely free from all the traditions and all traces of capitalism.
Hence the interesting phenomoo.
on that com­ mup.
ism in its first phase retains "the narrow horizon of bourgeois · right.
" Of course, bourgeois right in regard to distribution of .
.
articles of consumption inevitably presupposes the existence of the bourgeois state, for right is nothing without an apparatus capable of en/ orcing the observance of the standards of right.
Consequently, for :a certain time not only bourgeois right, but even the bourgeois state remains under communism, without the bourgeoisie! This may sound like a paradox or simply a dialectical puzzle which Marxism is often accused of inventing by people who would not take the slightest trouble to study its extraordinarily profound content.
As a matter of fact, however, the remnants of the old surviving t in the new confront us in life at every step, in nature as well as in society.
Marx did not smuggle a scrap of "bourgeois" right into t:ommunism of his own accord; he indicated what is economically and politically inevitable in the society which is emerging from· the womb of capitalism.
Democracy is of great importance for the working class in its struggle for freedom against the capitalists.
But democracy is by no means a boundary that must not be overstepped; it is only one of the stages in the process of development from feudalism to capitalism, and from capitalism to communism.
.
Democracy means equality.
The great significance of the prole­ tariat's struggle for equality and the significance of ·equality as a slogan will be clear if we correctly interpret it as meaning the abolition of classes.
But democracy means only formal equality.
As soon as equality is obtained for all members of society in rela-.
tion to the o'Wnership of the means of production, that is, equality of labour and equality of wages, humanity will inevitably be confronted with the question of going beyond formal equality to real equality, i.
e.
, to applying the rule, "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.
" By what stages, by what practical measures humanity will proceed to this higher aim-we do not and cannot know.
But i1: is important to realise how infinitely mendacious is the ordinary bourgeois conception of socialism as something lifeless, petrified, fixed once for all, whereas in reality only under socialism will a rapid, genuine, really mass movement, embracing first the majority and then the whole of the population, commence in all spheres of social and individual life.
Democracy is a form of state, one of its varieties.
Consequent­ ly, like every state, it, on the one hand, represents the organised, systematic application of force against persons; but, on the other hand, it signifies the formal recognition of the equality of all citizens, the equal right of all to determine the structure and admin­ istration of the state.
This, in turn, is connected with the fact that, at a certain stage in the development of democracy, it first rallies .
the proletariat as a 'revolutionary class against capitalism, and gives it the opportunity to crush, to smash to atoms, to wipe off the face of the earth the bourgeois, even the republican bourgeois, state machine, the standing army, the police and bureaucracy; to substitute for all this a more.
democratic, but still a state ma­ chine in the shape of the armeCJ masses of workers who become transformed into a universal people's militia.
Here "quantity is transformed into quality": such a degree of democracy is connected with overstepping the boundaries of bour­ geois society, with the beginning of its socialist reconstruction.
If, indeed, all take part in the administration of the state, capitalism cannot retain its hold.
The development of capitalism, in turn, itself creates the prerequisites that enable indeed "all" to take part in the administration of the state.
Some of these prerequisites are: universal literacy, already achieved in most of the advanced capitalist countries, then the "training and disciplining" of mil­ lions of workers by the huge, complex and socialised apparatus of the post-office, the railways, the big factories, large-scale com· merce, banking etc.
, etc.
With such economic prerequisites it is quite possible, immedi­ ately, overnight, after the overthrow of the capitalists and bureau· crats, to supersede them in the control of production and distri­ bution, in the work of keeping account of labour and its products by the armed workers, ny the whole of the armed population.
(The question of control and accounting must not be confused with the question of the scientifically educated staff of engineers, agrono­ mists and so on.
These gentlemen are working today and obey the capitalists; they will work even better tomorrow and obey the armed workers.
) Accounting and control-these are the principal things that are necessary for the "setting up" and correct functioning of the first phase of communist society.
All citizens are transformed into the salaried employees of the state, which consists of the armed workers.
All citizens become employees and workers of a single national state "syndicate.
" All that is required is that they should work equally-do their proper share of work-and get paid equal­ ly.
The accounting and control necessary for .
this have been so utterly simplified by capitalism that they have become the extra-.
ordinarily simple operations !li phecking, recording and issuing knows the first four rules of arithmetic can perform.
When the majority of the people themselves begin everywhere to keep such accounts and maintain such control over the capital­ ists (now converted into employees ) and over the intellectual gentry, who preserve their capitalist habits, this control will really become universal, general, national; and there will be no way of getting away from it, there will be "nowhere to go.
" The whole of society will have become a single office and a single factory with equality of work and equality of pay.
.
But this "factory" discipline, which the proletariat will extend to the whole of society after the defeat of the capitalists and the overthrow of the exploiters, is by no means our ideal, or eur ulti­ mate goal.
It is but a nec~ssary step for the purpose of thoroughly purging society of all the hideousness and foulness of capitalist exploitation, and for the purpose of advancing further.
From the moment all members of society, or even only the overwhelming majority, have learned to administer the state them· selves, have taken this business into their own hands, have "set up" control over the insignificant minority of capitalists, over the gentry, who wish to preserve their capitalist habits, and over the workers who have been completely demoralised by capitalism-.
from this moment the need for government begins to disappear.
The more complete democracy becomes, the nearer the moment approaches when it becomes unnecessary.
The more democratic the "state" of the armed workers-which is "no longer a state in the proper sense of the word"-becomes, the more rapidly does the state begin to wither away.
For when all have learned the art of administration, and will indeed independently administer social production, will independ· ently keep accounts, control the idlers, the gentlefolk, the swind­ lers and similar "guardians of capitalist traditions," the escape 1 When most of the functions of the state are reduced to this accounting and control by the workers themselves, it ceases to be a "political state,".

above, chapter IV, §2, Engels' "Con­ troversy With the Anarchists").
so increasing!! difficult, such a rare exception, and will probably he, accompamed by.
such swift and severe punishment (for the armed workers are practical men' and not sentimental intellectuals and they will scarcely allow anyone to trifle with them), tha~ very soon the necessity of observing the simple, fundamental rules of hlJman intercourse will become a habit.
The door will then be wide open for the transition from the first phase of communist society to its higher phase, and with it to the complete withering away of the state.
CHAPTER VI THE VULGARISATION OF MARXISM BY THE OPPORTUNISTS THE question of the relation of the state to the social revolution, and of the social revolution to the state, l'ike the question of revolution generally, troubled the prominent theoreticians and publicists of the Second International (1889-1914) very little.
But the most characteristic thing ·in the process of the gradual growth of opportunism, which led to the collapse of the Second International in 1914, is the fact that even when these people actually were confronted with this question they tried to evade it or else failed to notice it.
.
~---· In general, it may be said that evasiveness on the question of the relation of the proletarian revolution to the state-an evasiveness which was to the advantage of opportunism and fostered it-resulted in the distortion of Marxism and in its com­ plete vulgarisation.
To characterise this lamentable process briefly, we shall take.
the most prominent theoreticians of Marxism: Plekhanov and Kautsky.
1.
PLEKHANov's CONTROVERSY WITH THE ANARCHISTS Plekhanov wrote a special pamphlet on the question of the relation of anarchism to socialism, entitled Anarchism and Social­ ism, published in German in 1894.
Plekhanov managed somehow to treat this subject while com­ pletely ignoring the most vital, topical, and politically essential point in the struggle against anarchism, viz.
, the relation of the revo­ lution to the state, and the question of the state in general! His pam­ phlet is divided into two parts: one, historical and literary, contain-95 dhon and others; the other is philistine, and contains a clumsy dissertation on the theme that an anarchist cannot be distinguished from a bandit.
An amusing combination of subjects and most characteristic of Plekhanov's whole activity on the eve of the revolution and during the revolutionary period in Russia.
Indeed, in the years 1905 to 1917, Plekhanov revealed himself as a semi-doctrinaire and semi-philistine who, in politics, followed in the wake of the bourgeoisie.
We have seen h<lw, in their controversy with the anarchists, Marx and Engels very thoroughly explained their views on the re­ lation of revolution to the state.
In 1891, in his foreword to Marx's Critique of the Gotha Programme, Engels wrote that "we"-that is, Engels and Marx-"were at that time, hardly two years after the Hague Congress of the [First] International, engaged in the most violent struggle against Bakunin and his anarchists.
" The anarchists had tried to claim the Paris Commune as their "own," so to say, as a corroboration of their doctrine; and they betrayed utter inability to understand its lessons and Marx's ana­ lysis of these lessons.
Anarchism<i: has failed to give anything even approaching a true solution of the concrete political problems, viz.
, must the old state machine be smashed? and what should su­ persede it? But to speak of "anarchism and socialism" and evade the ques­ tion of the state, to fail to take note of the whole development of Marxism before and after the Commune, inevitably means slip­ ping into opportunism.
For the very thing opportunism needs is that the two questions just mentioned should not be raised at all.
This is already a victory for opportunism.
2.
KAUTSKY's CONTROVERSY WITH THE OPPORTUNISTS Undoubtedly an immeasurably larger number of Kautsky's works have been translated into Russian than into any other lan­ guage.
It is not without reason that German Social-Democrats sometimes say in jest that Kautsky is read more in Russia than I.
1.
in Germany (we may say, parenthetically, that there is deeper historical significance in this jest than those who first made it sus­ pected; for the Russian w-orkers, by creating in 1905 an ex~ra­ ordinarily strong, an unprecedented demand for the best works of the best Social-Democratic literature in the world, and by re­ ceiving translations and editions of these works in quantities un­ heard of in other countries, transplanted at an accelerated tempo, so to speak, the enormous experience of a neighbouring, more ad­ vanced country to the young soil of our proletarian movement).
Besides his popularisation of Marxism, I\autsky is particularly ·well known in our country because of his controversy with the opportunists, headed by Bernstein.
But one fact is almost unknown, one which cannot he overlooked if we are to set ourselves the task of investigating how it was that Kautsky drifted into the unbeliev­ ably disgraceful morass of confusion and defence of social-chauv­ inism during the great crisis of 1914-15.
This fact is the follow­ ing: shortly before he came out against the prominent representa-tives of opportunism in France (Miller and and Jaures) and in ---­ Germany (Bernstein), Kautsky betrayed very considerable va.
cil· lation.
The Marxian journal, Zarya,1 which was published in Stuttgart in 1901-02, and advocated revolutionary proletarian views, was forced to enter into controversy with Kautsky, to char· acterise as "elastic" the half-hearted, evasive and conciliatory res­ olution on the opportunists that he proposed at the International Socialist Congress in Paris in 1900.
Kautsky's letters published in Germany reveal no less hesitancy on his part before he took the field against Bernstein.
Of immeasurably greater significance, however, is the fact that, in his controversy with the opportunists, in his formulation of the question and his method of treating it, we can observe, now that we are investigating the history of his latest betrayal of Marx­ ism, his systematic gravitation towards opportunism precisely on the question of the state.
:i:,et us take Kautsky's first important work against opportu· nism, Bernstein und das sozialdemokratische Programm.
Kautsky 1 The Dawn.

7 the following: Bernstein, in his famous (the fame of Herostr~tus) V orausset­ zungen des Soz"ialismus, accuses Marxism of "Blanquism" (an ac.
cusation since repeated thousands of times by the opportunists and liberal bourgeois in Russia against the representatives of revolu­ tionary Marxism, the Bolsheviks).
In this connection Bernstein dwells particularly on Marx's Civil War in France, and tries, quite unsuccessfully, as we have seen, to identify Marx's views on the leSisons of the Commune with those of Proudhon.
Bernstein pays particular attention to Marx's conclusion, which the latter emphasised in his preface of 1872 to The Communist Manifesto, viz.
, that "the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready­ made state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes.
" This utterance "pleased" Bernstein so much that he repeated it no less than three times in his book-interpreting it in the most distorted opportunist sense.
As we havce seen, Marx wanted to say that the working class must smash, break, blow up (Sprengung-the expression used by Engels) the whole state machine.
But according to Bernstein it would appear as though Marx in these words warned the working class against excessive revolutionary zeal when seizing power.
A cruder and uglier distortion of Marx's idea cannot be im­ agined.
How, then, did Kautsky proceed in his detailed refutation of Bernsteinism? He refrained from probing the depths of the distortion of Marx­ ism by opportunism on this point.
He cited the above-quoted pas­ sage from Engels' preface to Marx's Civil War and said that ac­ cording to Marx the working class cannot simply lay hold of ,the ready-made state machine, but generally speaking, it can lay hold of it-and that was all.
Not a word does Kautsky utter ab'out the fact that Bernstein attributed to Marx the very opposite of Marx's real views, about the fad that the task of the proletarian revolution which Marx advanced in 1852 was to "smash" the state machine.
The result was that thinnost essential difference between Writing "in opposition" to Bernstein, Kautsky said: "We can safely leave the solution of the prcblem of the proletarian dicta­ torship to the future.
" (German edition, p.
172.
) This is not an argument against Bernstein, but, in essence, a concession to him, a surrender to opportunism; for at present the opportunists ask nothing better than to "safely leave to the future" all_ fundamental questions of the tasks of the proletarian revolu­ tion.
From 1852 to 1891, for forty years, Marx and Engels taught the proletariat that it must smash the state machine.
In 1899, Kautsky, confronted on this point with the complete betrayal of Marxism by the opportunists, fraudulently substituted for the question of whether it was necessary to smash this machine the question of the concrete forms in which it was to be smashed, and then tried to escape behind the screen of the "indisputable" (and barren) philistine truth that concrete forms cannot be known in advance!! A gulf separates Marx and Kautsky in their respective atti­ tudes towards the task of the proletarian party in preparing the ··working class for revolution.
.
We shall take the next, more mature, work by Kautsky, which also, to a large extent, was written to refute opportunist errors.
This is his pamphlet, The Social Revolution.
In this pamphlet the author chose as his special theme the question of "the proletarian revolution" and the "proletarian regime.
" In it he gave much that was exceedingly valuable, but he evaded the question of the state.
Throughout the pamphlet the author speaks of the conquest of poli-tical power-and nothing else; that is, he chooses a formula which makes a concession to the opportunists, for it admits the possibility of power being seiz~d u;ithout destroying the state machine.
The very thing which Marx, in 1872, declared to be "obsolete" in the pro­ gramme of The Communist Manifesto is revived by Kautsky in 1902! In the .
pamphlet a special section is devoted to "the forms ,.
of force at the disposal of the moderi1 large state, such as the bureaucracy and the army"; hut not a word, does he say about what the Com­ mun.
e had already taught the workers.
Evidently, Engels' warning, particularly to the German Socialists, against "superstitious rever­ ence" for the state was not an idle one.
Kautsky explains the matter by stating.
that the victorious proletariat "will carry out the democratic programme," and then he formulates the clauses of this programme.
But not a word does ~autsky utte.
r about the new things the year 1871 taught us concern­ mg bourgeois democracy being superseded by proletarian democ­ racy.
Kautsky disposes of the question bv "ponderous" sounding banalities such as : , '.
'~till, it goes without saying that we shall not achieve power under present c~nd1t1ons.
Revolution itself_ J?resupposes long and deep-going struggles, which will change our present political and social structure.
" Undoubtedly this "goes without saying," as much as the state­ ment that horses eat oats, or that the Volga flows into the Caspian ,~ea.
It .
is ,~ pity tha~ an empty and bombastic phrase about dee~-gomg struggles is used as a means of evading the question that Is urgent for the revolutionary proletariat, namely, what ex­ presses.
the "deep-going" nature of its revolution in relation to the state, m relation to democracy, as distinct from previous non-proletarian revolutions.
' By evading 1this question, Kautsky really makes a concession to opportunism on this very essential point, although in words he de­ clares terrible war against it and emphasises the importance of the ""d f I .
" (h I ea o revo ut1on ow much is this "idea" worth if one is afraid to teach the workers the concrete lessons of revolution?) or says, "revolutionary idealism before everything,'' or declares ;hat the English workers are now "little more than petty bourgeois.
" Kautsky .
writes: "~he m~st varied forms of enterprises-bureaucratic [ '!? J, trade union co-operative, private .
.
.
can exist side by side in socialist society.
' ":·:There are enterprises_ which cannot do without a bureaucratic[??] orgamsat1on, for example the railways.
Here the democratic organisation might f of parliament, which draws up the working regulations and superintends the management of the bureaucratic apparatus.
The management of other enter· prises may be transferred to the trade unions, and still others may become co-­ operative enterprises.
" -This reasoning is erroneous, and is a step backward compared with what Marx and Engels explained in the 'seventies, using the lessons of the Commune as an example.
As far as the alleged need for a "bureaucratic" organisation is concerned, there is no difference whatever between railways and any other enterprise in large-scale machine industry, any fac­ tory, any large store, or large-scale capitalist agricultural enter­ prise.
The technique of all such enterprises requires the very strict­ est discipline, the greatest accuracy on the part of everyone in carrying out his allotted task, for otherwise the whole enterprise would fail to work, or machinery or goods would be damaged.
In all such enterprises the workers will, of course, "elect delegates who will form a sort of parliament.
" But the whole point is that this "sort of parliament" will not be a parliament like the bourgeois-parliamentary institutions.
The whole point is that this "sort of parliament" will not merely "draw up the working regulations" and "superintend the manage· ment of the bureaucratic apparatus," as Kautsky, whose ideas do not go beyond the framework of bourgeois par liamentarism, im­ agines.
In socialist society the "sort of parliament" consisting of workers' deputies, will, of course, draw up the working regulations and superintend the management of the "apparatus"-but this apparatus will not be "bureaucratic.
" The workers, having con­ quered political power, will smash the old bureaucratic apparatus, they will shatter it to its very foundations, they will not leave a single stone of it standing; and they will put in its place a new one consisting of workers and office employees, against whose transformation into bureaucrats measures will at once be taken, as Marx and Engels pointed out in detail: 1) not only election, but also recall at any time; 2) payment no higher than that of or­ dinary Workers; 3) immediate introduction of control and SU· perintendence by all, so that all shall become "bureaucrats" for --------ca .

In the pamphlet we are examining Kautsky wrote: "The pre~ent situation brirgs the danger that we" (i.
e.
, German Social· Democracy) "may easily appear to be 'more moderate' th_an we are.
" Actually, it turned out that the German Social-Democratic Party was much more moderate and opportunist than it appeared to be! The more characteristic is it, therefore, that although he de· finitely declared that the revolutionary era had already begun, Kautsky, in the pamphlet which he himself said was devoted pre· cisely to an analysis of the "political revolution," again completely evaded the question of the state.
The sum total of all these evasions of the question, omissions and equivocations, inevitably led to complete surrender to op· portunism, of which we shall soon have to speak.
German Social-Democracy, in the person of Kautsky, seems to have declared: I keep to revolutionary views (1899); I recognise, in particular, the inevitability of the social revolution of the proletariat (1902); I recognise the approach of a new revolution­ ary era (1909); still, now that the question of the tasks of the proletarian revolution in relation to the state is raised, I go back· ward compared with what Marx said as long ago as 1852 (1912).
It was precisely in this direct form that the question was put in Kautsky's controversy with Pannekoek.
3.
KAUTSKY'S CONTROVERSY WITH PANNEKOEK In opposing Kautsky, Pannekoek came out as one of the repre· sentatives of the "Left radical" movement which counted in its ranks Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Radek and others.
Advocating revo· lutionary.
tactics, they were united in the conviction that Kautsky was going over to the position of the "centre," which wavered without principles between Marxism and opportunism.
The cor· rectness of this view was fully confirmed by the war, when this "centre" trend, or Kautskyism, wrongly called Marxian, revealed i.
tseH in all its repulsive wretchedne~.
I XXX, 2), Pannekoek characterised Kautsky's position as an attitude of "pas­ sive r~dicalism," as "a theory of' inactive waiting.
" "Kautsky loses sight of the process of revolution," said Pannekoek (p.
616).
In presenting the problem in this way, Pannekoek approached the subject which interests us, namely, the tasks of the proletarian revolution in relation to the state.
He wrote: .
''.
The.
straggle of the proletariat is not merely a struggle against the bour­ geoisie wrth state power as the objective, but a struggle against the state ~?~er.
The co;itent of this ;:evolution is the dest.
ruction and dissolution [Auf­ losung] of the mstruments o, power of the state with the aid of the instruments of power.
of.
the proletariat" (p.
544).
"The struggle will cease only when ~he o~gamsatron of the state is utterly destroyed.
The organisation of the major­ ity will then have demonstrated its superiority by having destroyed the organisa.
tion of the ruling minority" (p.
548).
· The formulation in which Pannekoek presented his ideas suf.
!e~s ~rom se:ious defects, but its meaning is sufficiently clear; and It is mterestmg to note .
how Kautsky combated it.
He wrote: .
"Up to now the difference between the Social-Democrats and the anarch-1s!s has been that.
the former wished to conquer state power while the latter WIShed to destroy rt.
Pannekoek wants to do both" (p.
724).
Although Pannekoek's exposition lacks precision and concrete.
ness--not to speak of other defects in his article which have no bearing.
on th.
e ~resent subject-Kautsky seized on the principle of the issue mdicated by Pannekoek; and on this fundamental qu~stion of principle Kautsky abandoned the Marxian position entirely, completely .
surrendered to opportunism.
His definition of the difference between the Social-Democrats and the anarchists is absolutely wrong, and he utterly vulgarised and distorted Marxism.
The difference between the Marxists and the anarchists is this: 1) the former, while aiming at the complete abolition of the state, recognise that this aim can only be achieved after classes have been abolished by the socialist revolution, as the result of the establishment of socialism which leads to the withering away of the state.
The latter want state can he abolished; 2) the former recognise that after the proletariat has conquered political power it must utterly d~st:oy the old state machine and substitute for it a new one cons1stmg of the organisation of armed workers, after the type of the Com-.
mune.
The latter, while advocating the destruction of the state machine, have absolutely no clear idea of what the proletariat will put in its place and how it will use its revolutionary power; the anarchists even deny that the revolutionary proletariat should utilise its state power, its revolutionary dictatorship; 3) the form-· er demand that the proletariat be prepared for revolution by utilis­ ing the present state; the latter reject this.
In this controversy it is Pannekoek and not Kautsky who repre­ sents Marxism, for it was Marx who taught that it is not enough for the proletariat simply to conquer state power in the sense that the old state apparatus passes into new hands,.
but that the prole, tariat must smash, break this apparatus and substitute a new one for it.
Kautsky abandons Marxism for the opportunists, because pre­ cisely this destruction of the state machine, which is utter~y unac­ ceptable to the opportunists, completely disappears from his argu· ment and he leaves a loophole for them which enables them to inter~ret "conquest" as simply winning .
a majority.
.
To cover up his distortion of Marxism, Kautsky behaves hke a Schoolman: he juggles with "quotations" from Marx.
In 1850 Marx wrote that "a decisive centralisation of power in the hands of the state" was necessary, and Kautsky triumphantly asks: does Pannekoek want to destroy "centralism"? This is simply a trick similar to Bernstein's identification of the views of Marxism and Proudhonism on federalism versus cen­ tralism.
Kautsky's '~quotation" has nothing to do with the case.
T~e new state machine permits of centralism as much as the old· 1f the workers voluntarily unite their armed forces, this will he centralism but this centralism will be based on the "complete de­ struction"' of the centralised state apparatus--the standing army, the police and the bureaucracy.
Kautsky acts exactly like a swind-ler when he ignores the perfectly well-known arguments of Marx and Engels on the Commune and pulls out a quotation which has nothing to do with the case.
He continues: "Perhaps he [Pannekoek] wants to abolish the state functions of the offi­ cials? But we cannot do without officials in the Party and the trade unions, much less in the state administration.
Our programme does not demand the abolition of state officials, but that they be elected by the people .
•.
.
"We are not discussing here the form the administrative apparatus of the 'future state' will assume, but whether our political struggle will ,dissolve [au/lost] the state power before we have captured it [Kautsky's italics}.
Which Ministry and its officials could be abolished?" Then follows an enumeration of the Ministries of Education, Justice, Finooce and War.
"No, not one of the present Ministries will be removed by our political 5truggle against the government .
.
.
.
I repeat in order to avoid misunderstand­ ing: we are not discussing here the form the future state will assume as a result of the victory of Social-Democracy, but the effect our opposition will have on the present state" (p.
72.
S).
This is an obvious trick: Pannekoek raised the question of revolution.
Both the title of his article and the passages quoted ab.
ove clearly indicate this.
In skipping to the question of "op­ position," Kautsky substitutes the opportunist point of view for the revolutionary point of view.
What he says is: at present, op­ position; we shall discuss the other matter after we have captured power.
Revolution has vanished! This is exactly what the oppor· tunists wanted.
Opposition and the political struggle in general are beside the point; we are concerned with revolution.
Revolution means that the proletariat will destroy the "administrative apparatus" and the whole state machine, and substitute for it a new one con­ ~isting of the armed workers.
Kautsky reveals a "superstitious reverence" for Ministries; hut why can they not &be superseded, say, by commissions of specialists, working under sovereign, all­ powerful Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies? The point is not whether the "Ministries" will remain, or whether "commissions of specialists" or other kinds of institutions will be set up; this is quite unimportant.
The point is whether the state machine (connected by thousands of threads with the bourgeoisie and completely saturated with routine and inertia) shall remain, or be destroyed and superseded by a new one.
Rev­ olution must not mean that the new class will command, govern with the aid of the old state machine, hut that this class will smash this machine and command, govern with the aid of a new ma, chine.
Kautsky either slurs over or has utterly failed to understand this fundamental idea of Marxism.
His question about officials clearly shows that.
he does not understand the lessons of the Commune or the teachings of Marx.
"We ·cannot do without officials in the Party and the trade unions .
.
.
_.
, We cannot do without officials under capitalism, Zlnder the rule of the bourgeoisie.
The proletariat is oppressed, the masses of the toilers are enslaved by capitalism.
Under capitaliiSm demo­ cracy is restricted, cramped, curtailed, mutllated by all the con· ditions of wage-slavery, the poverty and misery of the masses.
This is why and the only reason why the officials.
of our pol~tical _____ ~---and industrial organisations are corrupted-or, n1ore precisely, tend to be corrupted-by the conditions of capitalism, why t~ey betray a tendency to become transformed into bureaucrats; i.
e.
, into privileged persons divorced from the masses and superior to the masses.
This is the essence of bureaucracy, and until the capitalists have been expropriated and the bourgeoisie overthrown, even pro­ letarian officials will inevitably he "bureaucratised" to some extent.
.
According to Kautsky, since we shall have elected officials .
b "b ·" under socialism, we shall still have ureaucrat;s; ureaucracy will remain! This is exactly where he is wrong.
It was precisely the example of the Commune that Marx quoted to show that under b "b .
" " ffi .

th socialism officials will cease to ·e ureaucrats, o cia s , ey will cease to be such in proportion as, in addition to the election of officials, the principle of recall at any time is introduced, and as salaries are reduced to the level of the wages of the average worker and as the parliamentary institutions are superseded by "worki~g bodies, executive and legislative at the same tinie.
" In essence, the whole of Kautsky's argument against Panne-and trade union organisations, is merely a repe~1hon of Bernstein's "~rguments" against Marxism in general.
In ~is renegade book, Die V oraussetzungen des Sozialis­ mus, ~ernst~m.

Under socialism', all will take part m the work of government in turn and will soon be­ come accustomed to no one governing.
Marx's critico-analytical genius perceived in the practical ~easures of the Commune the turning point, which the opportunists ear and do not want to recognise because of their cowardice be-cause they are reluctant to break irrevocably wi"th the ho '· · d hi urge01sie, an w ch the anarchists do not want to perceive, either through haste or thr?ugh a gene~~l lack of understanding of the conditions of great social _changes.

Kropotkin and Co.
, fol­ low in the wake of the bourgeoisie); consequently, the tactics of the anarchist become the tactics of despair instead of a ruthlessly bold revolutionary effort to solve concrete problems while taking into account the practical conditions of the mass movement.
.
Marx teaches us to avoid both kinds of error; he teaches us to display boundless audacity in destroying the whole of the old state machine, and at the same time he teaches us to put the ques­ tion concretely: the Commune was able, within a few weeks, to start building a new, proletarian state machine by introducing such and such measures to secure wider democracy and to uproot bureau­ cracy.
Let us learn revolutionary audacity from the Communards; let us see in their practical measures the outline of the practically-.
urgent and immediately-possible measures, and then, pursuing this road, we shall achieve the complete destruction of bureaucracy.
The possibility of this destruction is guaranteed by the fact that socialism will shorten the working day, will raise the masses to a new life, ·will create conditions for the majority of the population that will enable everybody, without exception, to perform "state functions," and this will lead to the complete withering away of the state in general.
·Kautsky continues: "Its [the mass strike's] object cannot be to destroy the state power; its oniy object can be to wring concessions from the government on some particular question, or to replace a hostile government with one that would be more yield· ing [ entgegenkommende] to the proletariat .
.
.
.
But never, under any condi­ tions, can it [the proletarian victory over a hostile government] lead to the · destruction of the state power; it can lead only to a certain shifting [Verschie-bung] of the relation of forces within the state power .
••.
The aim of our ·political struggle remains, as hithP-rto, the conquest of state power by winning a majority in parliament and by converting parliament into the master of the government'.
' (pp.
726, 727, 732).
· This is nothing hut the purest and most vulgar opportunism: a repudiation of revolution in deeds, while accepting it in words.
The Com­ munist Manifesto proclaimed "the organisation of the proletariat as the ruling class.
" .
Kautsky will have to achieve his beloved "unity" with the Scheidemanns, Plekhanovs and Vanderv;eldes, all of whom will agree to fight for a government "that would be more yielding to the proletariat.
" But we shall go forward to a split with these traitors to social­ ism, and we shall fight for the complete destruction of the old state machine in order that the armed proletariat itself shall be­ come the government.
There is a "big difference" between the two.
Kautsky may enjoy the pleasant company of the Legiens, Davids, Plekhanovs, Potresovs, Tseretellis and Chernovs, who are quite willing to work for the "shifting of the relation of forces within the state power," for "winillng a majority in parliament," and conv;erting parliament into the "master of the government.
" A very worthy object, which is wholly acceptable to the opportu­ nists and which keeps everything within the framework of the bour­ geois parliamentary republic.
We shall go forward to a split with the opportunists; and the whole of the class conscious proletariat will be with us-not for the purpose of "shifting .
.
.
the relation of forces," but for the purpose of overthrowing the bourgeoisie, destroying bourgeois parliamentarism, for a democratic republic after the type of the Commune, or a republic of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, for the revolutionary dictator;:hip of the proletariat.
* * To the Right of Kautsky in international Socialism there are trends such as the Sozialistische M onatshefte1 in ~rmany (Legien, David, Kolb and many others, including the Scandina­ vians, Stauning and Branting) ; the followers of Jaures and Vander­ velde in France and Belgium; Turati, Treves and other represent­ atives of "the Right wing of the Italian Party; the Fabians and 1 Socialist ill! onthly.

this or that finance capita -wa--POSTSCRIPT TO THE FIRST EDITION Tms pamphlet was written in August and September 1917.
I had already drawn up the plan for the next, the seventh chapter, "The Experience of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917.
" But except for the title I was unable to write a single line of the chapter; I was "interrupted" by the political crisis-the eve of the October Revolution of 1917.
Such an "interruption" can only he welcomed; hut the writing of the second part of the pamphlet ("The Experience of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and 1917") will probably have to be put off for a long time.
It is more pleasant and useful to go through the "experience of the revolution" than to write about it.
Petrograd, December 13 (November 30), 1917 Written in August-September 1917 First published as a pamphlet in 1918 112 THE AUTHOR THE PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION AND THE RENEGADE KAUTSKY --~----PREFACE"* KAUTSKY's pamphlet, The Dictatorship of the Proletariat, recently published in Vienna (Wien, 1918, Ignaz Brand, 63 pp.
) is a very striking example of that complete and most disgraceful bankruptcy of the Second International which all honest Socialists in all coun­ tries have been talking about for a long time.
The question of the proletarian revolution is now becoming the practical question of the day in a number of states and therefore it is necessary to examine Kautsky's renegade sophisms and complete abjuration of Marxism.
First of all, however, it is important to point outthat the present writer has had numerolls .
occasions, from the very beginning of the war, to refer to l{'K~~~~~rupt¥~'.
w~Fi\tt:tf~i~.
A numb.
er of articles published by ·n;_-;;·· in the 'col1rs~--0£1914::t(r in the Sotsial­ Demokrat and the Kommunist, issued abroad, dealt with this sub­ ject.
These articles were afterwards collected and published by the Petrograd Soviet under the title Against the Stream, by G.
Zi­ noviev and N.
Lenin (Petrograd, 1918, 550 pp.
).
In a pamphlet published in Geneva in 1915 and simultaneously translated into German and French I wrote about "Kautskyism" as follows: "Kautsky, the greatest authority of the Second International, offers an extremely typical and striking example of how a merely verbal adherence to Marxism has, in fact, caused it to become tr:;msformed into 'Struvism'* '' or 'Brentano-ism' " (that is, into a liberal bourgeois doctrine, which recognises a non-revolutionary "class" struggle of the proletariat, and which was most strikingly expressed by the Russian writer Struve and the German economist B.
rentan.
o).
.
.
"We observe this also in the case of Plekhanov.
By means of obvious sophisms Marxism is emasculated of its living revolutionary soul, everything is accepted in it except the reve>lutionary methods of struggle, their pro­ paganda and preparation, and the education of the masses for that purpose.
Kautsky meaninglessly 'reconciles' the fundamental idea of social-chauvinism, namely, the defence of one's fatherland in the present war, with a diplomatic, fictitious concession to the Left in the form of abstention from voting the war credits, of a verbal proclamation of liis opposition, etc.
Kautsky, who in 1909 S* 11.
) Manifesto on the duty of taking revolutionary advantage of any future war, is now trying, in all sorts of ways, to justify and embellish social-chauvinism, and, like Plekhanov, joins the bourgeoisie in ridiculing all idea of revolution and all steps for an immediate revolutionary struggle.
· "The working class cannot attain its world-revolutionary object unless it wages a ruthless war against such renegacy, such spinelessness, such servility to opportunism, and against such an unparalleled theoretical vulgarisation of Marxism.
Kautskyism is not an accident, but a social product of the contradictions inherent in the Second International, of the combination of lip service to Marxism and submission to opportunism in deeds" (Socialism and War, by G.
Zinoviev and N.
Lenin, Geneva, 1915, pp.
13-14).
1 Again, in my book, Imperialism, the Latest Stage of Capitalism,2 which was written in 1916 and published in Petrograd in 1917, I examined in detail the theoretical fallacy of all Kautsky's argu­ ments about imperialism.
I quoted the definition of imperialism given by Kautsky: "Imperialism is a product of highly developed industrial capitalism.
It consists in the striving of every industrial capitalist nation to bring under its control and to annex increasingly big agrarian" (Kautsky's italics) "regions, irrespective of what nations inhabit those regions.
" I showed how utterly incorrect this definition was, and how it was "adapted" for the purpose of glossing over the most profound contradictions of imperialism, and of bringing about a reconcilia­ tion with opportunism.
I gave my own definition of imperialism, as follows: "Imperialism is capitalism in that stage of development in which the domination of monopolies and finance capital has established itself; in which the export of capital has acquired pronounced importance; in which the division of the world among the international trusts has· begun; in which the partition of all the territories of the globe among the great capitalist powers has been completed.
" I showed that Kautsky's critique of imperialism is at an even lower level than the bourgeois, philistine critique.
Finally, in August and September 1917-that is, before the proletarian revolution in Russia (which took place on November 7 [October 25], 1917)-I wrote a hook (published in Petrograd 1 Collected W arks, Vol.

and the Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution.
1 In Chapter IV of this book, entitled "The Vulgarisation of Marxism by the Opportunists," I devoted special attentio~ to Kautsky, showing that he had completely distorted ~he doctrmes of Marx that he had made them appear like opportumsm, and that "he had' repudiated the revolution in deeds, while accepting it in words.
" In substance the chief theoretical mistake Kautsky makes in his pamphlet on' the dictatorship of the proletariat is precisel~ this opportunist distortion of Marx's doctrine of the sta~e which I exposed in detail in my pamphlet, The State and Revol~twn .
.
It was necessary to make these preliminary observat10ns.
m order to prove that I had openly accused Kautsky of being a renegade long before the Bolsheviks assumed state power and were con­ demned by him on that account.

One p~ his hack on the twentieth century and faces the eighteenth century, and for the hundredth time, in a number of paragraphs, tediously chews the cud over the relation between bourgeois democracy and absolutism and medirevalism.
It is positively like chewing rags in one's sleep! What a lack of understanding of the fitness of things! One cannot help smiling at Kautsky's efforts to make it appear that there are people who preach "contempt for democracy" (p.
11) and so forth.
It is by such twaddle that Kautsky has to gloss over and confuse the question at issue, for he formulates it in the manner of the liberals, speaks about democracy in general, and not of bourgeois democ­ racy; he even avoids using this precise class term, and, instead, tries to speak about "pre-Socialist" democracy.
This windbag devotes a third of his pamphlet, twenty pages out of a total of sixty-three, to this twaddl·e, whiQh is very agreeable to the bourgeoisie, for it is tantamount to embellishing bourgeois democracy, and obscures the question of the proletarian revolution.
.
Still, the title of Kautsky's pamphlet is The Dictatorship of the Proletariat.
Everybody knows that this is the very essence of Marx's doctrine; and after much idle chatter Kautsky was obliged to quote Marx's words on the dictatorship of the proletariat.
But the way in which he, the "Marxist," did this was simply farcical.
Listen to this: "This view" (which Kautsky dubs "contempt for democracy") "rests upon a single word of Karl Marx.
" This is what Kautsky literally says on page 20, and on page 60 the same thing is repeated in a still more pointed form, to the effect that the Bolsheviks "op­ portunely remembered the catchword"-this is literally what he says: des Wortchens-" 'dictatorship of the proletariat,' which Marx once used in 1875 in a letter.
" Here is Marx's "catchword": 1 "Between capitalist and communist society lies the period of ·the revol­ utionary transformation of the one into the other.
There corresponds to this also ·a political transition period in which the 'state can b.
e'nothing but the revofotionary dictatorship of the proletariat.
'" '' 1 See note to p.
60.
*-Ed.
and even a "catchword" is a mockery of Marxism, complete renunciation of it.
It must ~10t be forgotten that Kautsky knows Marx almost by heart, and, judging by all he has written, he has in his desk, or in his head, a number of pigeon-holes in which all that was ever written by Marx is carefully distributed so as to be ready at hand for quota­ tion.
Kautsky cannot but know that both Marx and Engels, in their letters as well as in their published works, repeatedly spoke about the dictatorship of the proletariat, both before and after the Paris Commune.
Kautsky cannot but know that the formula "dictatorship of the proletariat" is but a mor·e historically concrete and more scientifically exact formulation of the proletariat's task of "smash­ ing" the bourgeois state machine, about which Marx and Engels, in summing up the experience of the Revolution of 1848, and, still more so, of 1871, spoke for forty years between 1852 and 1891.
* How is this monstrous distortion of Marxism by this "erudite" Marxist, Kautsky, to be explained? Speaking of the philosophical basis of this phenomenon, we would say that it is tantamount to the substitution of eclecticism and sophistry for dialectics.
Kautsky is a past master of this sort of subterfuge.
Speaking of it from the standpoint of practical politics, we would say that it is tantamount to.
subserviency to the opportunists, i.
e.
, in the long run, to the bourgeoisie.
Since the outbreak of the war, Kautsky has made in­ creasingly rapid progress in this art of being a Marxist in words and a lackey of the bourgeoisie in deeds, until he has attained virtuosity in it.
One becomes still more convinced of ihis when one examines the remarkable way in which Kautsky "interprets" Marx's "catch­ word," the dict~torship of the proletariat.
Listen: "Marx, unfortunately, failed to show us in greater detail how he conceived this dictatorship.
" (This is the utterly mendacious phrase of a renegade, for Marx and Engels gave us quite a number of most precise indications which our "erudite" Marxist has deliberately ignored.
) "Literally, the word 'dictatorship' means the abolition of democracy.
But, of course, taken literally, this word also means the undivided rule of a single individual unrestricted by any laws-an autocracy, which differs from despotism only in that it is regarded, not as a permanent stat~ institution, but as a t:rausitor:y emergenc¥ measure.

In order to transform Kautsky's liberal and lying assertion into a Marxian and true one, one must say: dictatorship does not neces­ sarily mean the abolition of democracy for the class that exercises dictatorship over the other classes; but it certainly does mean the abolition (or very material restriction, which is also a form of -aboli~ion) of ~e~ocracy_for the class over which, or against which, the ~1ctatorsh1p 1s exercised.
But, however true this assertion may be, it does not give a definition of dictatorship.
Let us examine Kautsky's next sentence: .
"But.
of .
c?urse, taken lit~rally, this word also means the undivided rule of a smgle md1v1dual unrestricted hy any laws.
" Like a blind puppy casually sniffing in one direction and then in another, Kautsky accidentally stumbled upon one true idea (nam~ly, that dictatorship is power unrestricted by any laws) but he failed to give a definition of dictatorship, and, moreover, he uttered an obvious historical falsehood, viz.
, that dictatorship means ~e power of a single person.
This is not even grammatically correct, smce the power of dictatorship can also be excercised by a handful of persons, by an oligarchy, by a class, etc.
Kautsky then goes on to point out the difference between dic­ ~atorship and despotism, but, although what he says is obviously mconect, we shall not dwell upon it, as it is wholly irrelevant to the question that interests us.
Everyone knows Kautsky's inclination to turn from the twentieth to the eighteenth century and from the eighteenth century to classical antiquity, and I hope that the German proletariat, after it has established its dictatorship, will take this · inclination into account a.
Q.
d appoint him, say, teacher of ancient history at some secondary school.
To try to evade a definition of the ~ict~torship of the proletariat by philosophising about despotism is either extreme stupidity or very clumsy trickery.
As a result, we find that, having undertaken to discuss the dic­ tatorship, Kautsky has said a great deal that is contrary to the truth, ~ut h~s not given us a definition! Yet, without trusting to his mental iacult1es, he could have had recourse to his memory and taken from h~s "pigeo_n-holes" all those instances in which Marx speaks of the d1ctatorsh1p.
Had he done so, he Dictatorship is power based directly upon force and unrestricted by any laws.
The revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat is power won and maintained by the violence of the proletariat against the bour­ geoisie, power that is unrestricted by any laws.
And this simple truth, a truth that is as plain as noonday to every class conscious worker (representing the masses, and not the upper stratum of petty-bourgeois scoundrels who have been bribed by the capitalists, such as are the social-imperialists of all coun­ tries), this truth, which is obvious to every representative of the exploited classes which are fighting for their emancipation, this truth, which is indisputable for every Marxist, has to be "extorted almost by main force" from that most learned gentleman, Mr.
Kautsky.
How is such a phenomenon to be explained? Simply by that spirit of servility with which the leaders of the Second lnterna· tional, who have become contemptible sycophants in the service of the bourgeoisie, have become imbued.
First, Kautsky committed a wbterfuge by proclaiming the ob­ vious nonsense that the word dictatorship, in its literal sense, means the dictatorship of a single person, and then, on the strength of this subterfuge, he declared that Marx's words about the dictatorship of a class must not be taken literally (but must be taken to mean that dictatorship does not connote revolutionary violence, but mere­ ly "the peaceful winning of a majority under bourgeois"-mark you-" democracy").
One must, if you please, distinguish between a "condition" and a "form of government"! A wonderfully profound distinction; it is like drawing a distinction between the stupid "condition" of a person who reasons foolishly and the "form" of this stupidity! Kautsky found it necessary to interpret dictatorship as a "con­ dition of rulership" (this is the literal expression he uses on the very next page, p.
21), because thereby revolntionary violence, violent revolution, disappears.
The "condition of rulership" is a condition in which any majority finds itself under .
.
.
"democracy.
" Thanks to such a fraudulent trick, revolution snccessfully disappears.
But this trick is too crude and will not save Kautsky.
Oi!e can-----------and means a "condition" of revolutionary violence of one class against another which is very disagreeable to all renegades.
The absurdity of draw­ ing a distinction between "condition" and "form of govern­ ment" becomes patent.
It is trebly stupid to speak of forms of government in this connection, for every child knows that monarchy and republic are two different forms of government.
It must be explained to Mr.
Kautsky that both these forms of government, like all transitional forms of government under capitalism, are but so many varieties of the bourgeois state, i.
e.
, of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
Lastly, to speak of forms of government is not only a stuuid hut also a very crude falsification of Marx, who very clearly s~ok~ of this or that form or type of state, and not of forms of government.
The proletarian revolution is impossible without the forcible destruction of the bourgeois state machine and the substitution for it of a new one which, in the words of Engels, is "no longer a state in the proper sense of the word.
" But Kautsky found it necessary to gloss this over and to lie­ his renegade position demanded it.
S~e what ~iserable evasions he has to resort to for this purpose.
First evas10n: .
"That Marx did not have in view in this connection a form of government is proved.
~Y the fact that he was of the opinion that in England and America the trans1t10n could take place peacefully, i.
e.
, in a democratic way.
" The form of government has nothing to do with the question, for there.
are monarchies which are not typical of the bourgeois s~ate, f~r mstance, such as have no militarism, and there are repub­ lics which are quite typical in this respect, i.
e.
, having militarism and a bureaucracy.
This is a universally known historical and political fact, and Kautsky will not succeed in falsifying it.
If Kautsky had wanted to argue in a serious and honest manner he wou.
ld hav~ asked himself: are there historical laws governing revolut10n which know of no exception? And the reply would have bee~: no, no such laws exist.
These laws only apply to what is typical, to what Marx once termed the "ideal," meaning average, normal, typical capitalism.
Further, was there in the seventies of the last century anything which made England and America an exception in regard to what we are now discussing? It will be obvious to anyone familiar with the requirements of science :Ln the domain of historical problems that such a question must be put.
To fail to put it is tantamount to falsifying science, to engaging in sophistry.
And, the question having been put, there can be no doubt as to the reply: the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat is violence against the bourgeoisie; and the necessity for such violence is particularly created, as Marx and Engels have repeatedly explained in detail (particularly in The Civil War in France and in the preface to it), by the eXistence of militarism and bureaucracy.
But it is precisely these institutions that were non-existent in England and America in the seventies of the nineteenth century, when Marx made his observations (they do exist in England and in America now) .
Kautsky has had to be dishonest literally at every step in order to cover up his renegacy! And note how he unwittingly betrayed his cloven hoof; he wrote: "peacefully," i.
e.
, in a democratic way!! In defining the term "dictatorship," Kautsky tried his utmost to conceal from the reader the fundamental symptom of this concept, namely, revolutionary violence, but now the truth has emerged: the point under discussion is the antithesis between peaceful and violent revolution.
That is the whole point.
Kautsky had to resort to all these evasions, sophisms and fraudulent falsifications in order to dis­ sociate himself from violent revolution, and to conceal his renuncia­ tion of it, his desertion to the side of liberal labour politics, i.
e.
, to the side of the bourgeoisie.
That is the whole point.
Kautsky, the "historian," so shamelessly falsifies history that he forgets the fundamental fact that pre-monopoly capitalism, which reached its l'ienith in the seventies of the nineteenth century, was, by virtue of its fundamental economic traits (which were most typical in England and America) distinguished by its relative attach­ ment to peace and freedom.
Imperialism, i.
e.
, monopoly capitalism, which finally matured only in the twentieth century, is, by virtue of its fundamental economic traits, distinguished by the least attach-opment of militarism everywhere.
To "fail to n-~tice" this in discussing the extent to which a peaceful or violent revolution is typical or probable is to stoop to the -position of a common or garden lackey of the bourgeoisie.

_ if:¥JZ :W:he bourge-;}!'ire\va~iiot'deprived ·ortlie ranc ise, i.
e.
, the Commune was <elected "democratically.
" And Kautsky says elatedly: "The dictatorship of the proletariat, for him" (Marx) "is a state of thino-s which necessarily follows from pure democracy, if the proletariat represen~s the overwhelming majority" (bei iiberwiegendem Proletariat) (p.
21).
This argument of Kautsky's is so amusing that one almost suffers from an embarras de richesse (an embarrassment due to the wealth of replies that can be made to it).
Firstly, it is well known that the flower, the General Staff, the upper strata of the bourgeoisie had fled from Paris to Versailles.
In Versailles there was the "Socialist" Louis Blanc-which circumstance, by the way, proves the falsity of Kautsky's assertion that "all trends'' of Socialism took part in the Paris Commune.
Is it not ridiculous to represent the division of the inhabitants of Paris into two belligerent camps, in one of which the entire militant and politically active section of the bourgeoisie had concentrated, as "pure democracy," with "universal suffrage"? Secondly, the Paris Commune waged war against Versailles as lhe workers' government of France waging war against the bour­ geois government.
What has "pure democracy" and "universal suffrage" got to do with the case when Paris decided the fate of France? When Marx expressed the opinion that the Paris Commune had committed a mistake in failing to seize the bank, which be­ longed to the whole of France, did he take the principles and prac­ tice of "pure democracy" as his starting point? Obviously, Kautsky ·writes his books in a country where the people are forbidden by the police to laugh in "crowds," other· wise Kautsky would have been killed by laughter.
Thirdly, I would respe.
ctfully remind Mr.
Kautsky, who knows "pure democracy": "Have these gentlemen [the anti-authoritarians*] never seen a revolution? A revolution is undoubtedly the most authoritarian thing there is.
It is the act whereby one part of the population imposes its will upon the other part by means o"f rifles, bayonets and cannon, which are authoritarian means if ever there were any.
And the victorious party, if it does not wish to have fought in vain, must maintain its rule by means of the terror which its ~rms inspire in the reactionaries.
Would the Paris Commune have lasted a smgle day if it had not made use of this authority of the armed population against the bourgeoisie? Should we not on the contrary reproach it for not having made more extensive use of this authority?" Here you have your "pure democracy"! How Engels would have ridiculed the vulgar petty bourgeois, the "Social-Democrat" (in the French sense of the forties of the last century * * and in the European sense of 1914-18), who took it into his head to talk about "pure democracy" in relation to a society divided into classes! But enough.
It is impossible to enumerate all the absurdities uttered by Kautsky, since every phrase he utters is a bottomless pit of renegacy.
Marx and Engels analysed the Paris Commune in a most de­ tailed manner and showed that its merit lies in its attempt to smash, to break up the "existing state machine.
" Marx and Engels con­ sidered this conclusion to be so important that they used it in 1872 to amend the (in part) "obsolete" programme of the Communist Manifesto;**-"' and it was the only amendment they made.
Marx and Engels showed that the Paris Commune abolished the army and the bureaucracy, abolished parliamentarism, destroyed "that par­ asitic excrescence, the state," etc.
; but the all-wise Kautsky, donning his night-cap, repeats the fairy-tale about "pure democracy," which has been told a thousand times by liberal professors.
Not without reason did Rosa Luxemburg declare on August 'J,, 1914, that German Social-Democracy was now a stinking corpse.
*°"'*""' Third evasion: "When we speak of the dictatorship as a form of government we cannot speak of the dictatorship of a class, since a class, as we have already pointed out, can only 1·ule but not govern.
" It is "organisations" or "parties" that govern! that is ridiculous nonsense.
And Marx does not speak of the form of government, hut of the form or type of state.
That is something altogether different.
It is altogether wrong, also, to say that a class cannot govern.
Such an absurdity can only be uttered by a parlia­ mentary cretin who sees nothing but bourgeois parliaments, who has noticed nothing but "ruling parties.
" Any European country will pr~vide Kautsky with examples of government by a ruling class, as for mstance by the landlords in the Middle Ages, in spite of their insufficient organisation.
To sum up: Kautsky has in the most incredible manner dis­ torted the concept "dictatorship of the proletariat," and has trans­ formed Marx into a common or garden liberal, i.
e.
, he himself has rolled down to the level of a liberal who utters banal phrases about "pure democracy," embellishes and glosses over the class content of bourgeois democracy, and, above all, is mortally afraid of the oppressed class resorting to revolzttionary violence.
By "interpret­ ing" the concept "revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat" to mean that the oppressed class will not use revolutionary violence against their oppressors, Kautsky beat the world record in the lib'er­ al distortion of Marx, and the renegade Bernstein has proved to be a mere puppy compared with the renegade Kautsky.

-Ed.
BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIAN DEMOCRACY THE .
question which Kautsky has S() hopelessly confused really stands as follows: If we are not to mock at common sense a'ud hist~ry, it is obvious that we cannot speak of "pure democracy" so long .
as different classes exist; we can only speak of class democracy.
(One may say in parenthesis that "pure democracy" is not only an ignorant p_hrase; revealing lack of understanding of the c~ass struggle .
and of t}ie.
nature of the state, but also a hollow phrase, since in communist society democracy will gradually change and becmne a habit, .
and finally wither away, but will never be "pure" democracy.
) .
.
.
"Pure democracy" is the mendacio'us phrase of a .
liberal ~ho wants to fool the working class.
History kno~s of bourgeois democ­ racy which takes the place of feudalism, and of proletarian de­ nio~cracy which takes the place of bourgeois democracy.
-When Kautsky devotes scores of pages to "proving" that.
bour­ geois democracy is progressive compared with medirevalism, and that the proletariat must utilise it in.
its struggle against the bour­ geoisie, he is just indulging in the, usual liberal twaddle to fool the workers.
This is a truism not only for educated Germany, bu:t also for uneducated Russia.
Kautsky is simply throwing "learned'.
' dust into the eyes of the workers when, with a serious mien, he talks about Weitling and the Jesuits of Paraguay* and many other things; but_does this only to avoid telliiig them about the bourge;is essence of contemporary, i.
e.
, capitalist democracy.
Kautsky takes from Marxism what is-acceptable to the liberals, .
to the bourgeoisie (viz.
, the criticism of the Middle Ages-, and the progressive historical.
role of capitalism in general and of capit~l-.
.
ist democracy in particular), and throws away, ignores, glo~s~s over all that in Marxism which is unacceptable to the bourgeoisie 9 129 geoisie with a view to the destruction of the latter) .
That is why Kautsky, by virtue of his objective position and irrespective of what.
his subjective convictions may be, inevitably becomes the lackey of the bourgeoisie.
Bourgeois democracy, although a great historical advance in aompari1:1on with medi~valism, :uevertheless remains and under capitalism cannot but remain restricted, trun~ated,_ false and hypo· critical, a paradise for the rich arid a snare and a deception for the exploited, for the poor.
It is this simple truth, -which forms an essential part of Marx's teachings, that Kautsky, the "Marxist," has failed to understand.
On this fundamental question Kautsky gives us what is agreeable to the bourgeoisie, instead of a scientific criti­ cism of those conditions which make all bourgeois democracy only a democracy for the rich.
· Let us first recall to.

Kautsky the theoretical propositions of Marx and Engels, which the erudite Kautsky has so disgracefully "forgotten" (in order to please the bourgeoisie), and then we shall explain the question in a very elementary manner, .

" (Marx, The Civil War in France.
) Every one of these propositions, which are well known to the, most learned Mr.
Kautsky, is a direct challenge to him and lays bare his renegacy.
Nowhere in his pamphlet does Kautsky rnveal the slightest understanding of these truths.
The whole of his pam-phlet is but a n10ckery of Marxism.
.
Take the fundamental laws of contemporary states, take their administration, ta!rn the right of assembly, freedom of the press, and "equality of all citizens before the law," and you: will see at every step evidence of the hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy with which every honest and class conscious worker is familiar.
There is not a single state, however democratic, which does not contain loopholes or limiting clauses in its constitution guaranteeing the bourgeoisie the possibility -Of dispatching troops against the work-.
ers, of proclaiming martial law, and so forth, in case of a "dis­ turbance of the peace," i.
e.
, in case the exploited class "disturbs" its position of slavery and tries to behave in a non-slavish manner.
Kautsky shamelessly embellishes bourgeois democracy and hushes, up, for instance, what the most democratic and republican bour­ geoisie of America and Switzerland do against workers on strike.
Oh, the wise and most learned Kautsky remains silent about these things! This pundit and statesman does not realise that to remain silent on this matter is despicable.
He prefers to tell the workers nursery tales to the effect that democracy means "protecting the minority.
" It is incredible, but it is a fact.
In the Year of Our Lord 1918, in the fifth year of the world imperialist slaughter and the strangulation of internationalist minorities (i.
e.
, those who have not despicably betrayed socialism, like the Renaudels and the Lon­ guets, the Scheidemanns and the Kautskys, the Hendersons and the Webbs, etc.
) in all "democracies of the world,"* the learned Mr.
Kautsky sweetly sings the praises of "protection of the minority.
" Those who are interested may read this on page 15 of K~utsky's pamphlet.
And on page 16 this learned individual tells you about 9* bourgeoisiei"}f -1 were Krupp <>-r Scheidemann, c1:menceau or Renaudel, I would give Mr.
Kautsky millions, reward him with J u~a~, kis~~s, ,~raise him before the workers and urge "Socialist um:y w1tn.

To write pamphlets agamst t~e ~1ctatorsh1p o! the pr~letariat, to talk about the Whigs and Tones m England m the e1ghteen_th century, to assert that democracy means "protecting the -minority," and remain silent abou~ pogroms· against internationalists in the "democratic" re.
public of America---is this not rendering lackey's service to.
the bourgeoisie? The learned Mr.
Kautsky "forgot"-no doubt aceidentally-a "bagatelle"; namel!, that the ruling party in a bourgeois democracy extends t~e protectron ?f the minority only to another bourgeois party, "'.

Kautsky could have studied thi "l " f b -· d s aw o ou.
rge01s emocracy in connection with the Dreyfus affair in ~ep~bhcan France, with the lynching of Negroes and international­ ists m the democratic republic of America, with the case of Ireland and _lJlster in democratic England, with the persecution of the Bol­ ~hev1ks and the ~rganisation of pogroms against them in April 1917 m the democratic republic of Russia.
* I have purposely chosen exam~les not only.
from the period of the war but also from pre­ war hme.
But sentunent~l Mr.
Kautsky is pleased to shut his eyes to these facts of the twentieth century, and instead to tell the workers wond.
erfull! new: and remarkably interesting, unusually instructive and ~ncred1bly important things about the Tories and Whigs oi the eighteenth century! 0 _ Take the bourgeois parliament.
· Can it be that learned Mr Kautsky has never heard that the more highly democracy is devel~ Stock Exchange and the hankers? This, of course, does not mean that we must not use bourgeois parliaments (the Bolsheviks ·have made better use of them than any other party in the world, for in 1912-14 we captured the entire workers' curia in the Fourth Duma *).
But it does mean that only a liberal can forget the historical limitations and conventional character of bourgeois par­ liamentarism as Kautsky does.
Even in the most democratic bour­ geois state the oppressed masses at every step encounter the crying contradiction between the format equality proclaimed by the "de­ mocracy" of the capitalists, and the thousand and one real limita­ tions and restrictions which make the proletarians wage-slaves.
It is precisely this contradiction that opens the_ eyes· of the masses to the rottenness, mendacity and hypocrisy of capitalism.
-It is this contradiction which the agitators and propagandists of socialism are constantly showing up to the masses, in ·order to prepare them for the revolution.
And now that the era of revolution has begun, Kautsky turns his back upon it and begins to extol the charms of moribund bourgeois democracy! Proletarian democracy, of which Soviet government is one of the forms, has given a development and expansion of democracy hitherto unprecedented in the world, precisely for the vast majority of the population, for the exploited and for the toilers.
To write a whole pamphlet about democracy, as Kautsky did (in which he devotes two pages to dictatorship and scores of pages to "pure democracy") and fail to notice this fact means distorting the subject in a liberal way.
Take foreign politics.
In no bourgeois state, not even in the most democratic, are they conducted openly; In all democratic countries _:_,.
France, Switzerland, America, or England-:-:-the masses are de­ ceived on an.
incomparably wicler scale and iri a more sµbtle _man• ner than in other countries.
The Soviet governm~nt in a revolution• arf manner has torn the veil of mystery from foreign politics.
** Kautsky has not noticed this and remains silent about it, although in the present era of predatory wars and secret-treaties ·for the i'division Of sph~re~ of Uifl.
l1en~e" (i.
e.
, for the_ partition of the world ance, for it is a matter that determines the question of peace, it is a question of life and death for tens o,f millions of people.
Take the organisation of the state.
Kautsky clutches at all manner of "trifles," down to the argument that under the Soviet constitution elections are "indirect," but he misses the essence of the thing.
He fails to see the class nature of the state apparatus, of the machinery of state: under bourgeois democracy the capitalists, by a thousand .
and one tricks-which are the more artful and effective the more "pure" democracy is developed_:.
_keep the masses away from the work of administration and frustrate the freedom of the press, the right of assembly, etc.
The Soviet government is the first in the world (or strictly speaking the second, because the Paris Commune began to do the same thing) to attract the masses, precisely the exploited masses, to the work of administration.
For the toiling masses, participation in bourgeois parliaments (which never decide the important questions under bourgeois democracy, because they are decided by the Stock Exchange and the banks) is hindered by a thousand and one obstacles, and the workers know and feel see and realise perfectly well that the bourgeois parliaments are in~titu­ tions alien to them, instruments for the oppression of the proletariat h~ the_ bourgeoisie, institutions of the hostile class, of the exploiting mmonty.
.
_The Soviets are the direct organisation of the toiling and ex· .
plo1~e~ masses themselves, which enables them to organise and adm1mster the state themselves in every possible way.
And in this it is pr.
ecisely the vanguard of the toiling and exploited, the urban prnletaiiat: that enjoys the advantage in that it is best organised by the large enterprises; it is much ea>1ier for it to elect and watch electio:is.
The Soviet organisation automatically helps to unite all the toilers and exploited round their vanguard, the proletariat.
The old bourgeois apparatus, the bureaucracy, the privileges of wealth, of bourgeois education, of social connections, etc.
; which are the more varied, the niore highly bourgeois democracy is de­ yeloped-all this disappears under the Soviet organisation.
Free· dom of the press ceases to b~hypocrisy, because the printing presses and stocks of paper are taken away from the bourgeoisie.
The same manor houses.
The Soviet government has taken thousands and thousands of these best buildings from the exploiters, and in this way it has made the right of assembly-without which democracy is a fraud-a million times more "democratic.
" The indirect elec­ tions to the non-local Soviets make it easier to hold Congresses of Soviets, they make the entire apparatus less costly, more flexible, more accessible to the workers and peasants at a time when life is seething and it is necessary to be able quickly to recall a deputy or to elect him to the general Congress of Soviets.
Proletarian democracy is a million times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy; Soviet gov~rnment is a million times more democratic than the most democratic bourgeois republic.
Only one who deliberately serves the bourgeoisie, or one who politically is quite dead, who .
does not see real life from behind the dusty pages of bourgeois books, who is thoroughly imbued with bourgeois-democratic prejudices, and thereby objectively becomes the lackey of the bourgeoisie, could have failed to see this.
Only one who is incapable of presenting the question from the point of view of the oppressed classes could have failed to see this.
Is there a single country in the world, even among the most democratic bourgeois countries, in which the average rank-and-file worker, the average rank-and-file village labourer, or village serni· proletarian generally (i.
e.
, the representative of the oppressed: masses, the overwhelming majority of the population), enjoys anything approaching such liberty of holding meetings in the best buildings, such liberty to use the best printing works and largest stocks of paper, to express his ideas and to protect his interests, such liberty to promote meh and women of his own class to ad­ minister and to "run" the state as in Soviet Russia? .
It is ridiculous to think that Mr.
Kautsky could find in atry country one well-informed worker or agricultural labourer out of a thousand who would have any doubts as to the reply to give to this question.
Instinctively, from hearing fragments of admis· sions of the truth in the bourgeois press, the workers of the whole world sympathise with the Soviet Republic precisely because they regard it as a proletarian democracy, a democracy for the poor, , We are governed (and our state is "run") by bourgeois bureau­ crats,_ by bo~rgeois me~hers of parliament, by bourgeois judges­ such is the simple, ohv10us and indisputable truth, which tens and h~ndr~ds of.
millions of the exploited classes in all bourgeois coun­ tries, mcludmg the most democratic, know from their living experi­ ence, feel and realise every day.
In Russia the bureaucratic apparatus -has been completely smashed up, razed to the ground; the old judges have all been ex­ pelled: the bourgeois parliament has been dispersed-and far more accessibl~ repr~sentation has been given to the workers and peas­ a~ts; their Soviets have replaced the bureaucrats, or their Soviets no'; control the.
bureaucrats, and their Soviets now elect the judges.
T~1s fact al~ne is enough to cause all the oppressed classes to recog­ nise the_ Soviet ~overnment, i.
e.
, the present form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, as being a million times more democratic than th~ most democratic bourgeois republic.
, : .
.
K~~tsky_ does not understand this truth, which is so obvious and mteII1gible to every worker, because he has "forgotten " "u _ I d" ' n earne to put the question: democracy for what class? He argues from the point of view of "pure" (i.
e.
, non-class? or above-class?) democracy.
_He argues !i~e Shylock: all I want is my pound of flesh.
Equality for all citizens-otherwise it is not democracy.
We must ask the l~arned "Marxist" and "Socialist" Kautsky: .
Can.
there he equ~ht! ~etween the exploited and the exploiters? It-Is_ m~nst~ous? it I~ mcredible, that one should have to put such a question m d1scussmg a hook Written by the ideological leader of _the Second International.
But "having undertaken a task stick to It t? the end:" Havirig undertaken.
to write about Kautsky, i must explain t? the learned mail why there can lJe no equality hetwee1;1; the exploiters and fhe ex:ploite!f.
·· · · · --,-,.
-I CAN THERE BE EQUALITY BETWEEN THE EXPLOITED AND THE EXPLOITERS? KAUTSKY says: 1) "The exploiters were always only a small minority of the population?' _ (p.
14 of Kautsky's pamphlet).
This is certainly true.
Taking this as the starting point, .
.
what should he the argument? One may argue in a Marxian, in a socialist way, taking as one's basis the relation between the exploited and the ~xploiters; or one may argue in a liberal, in a bourgeois-demo­ cratic way, taking as one's basis the relation between the majority and the minority.
If we argue in a Marxian way we must say: the exploiters in­ evitably transform-the state (we are speaking of democracy, i.
e.
, one of the forms of the state) into an instrument for the rule of their class, of tlie exploiters, over the exploited.
Hence, so long as there are exploiters who rule the majority, the exploited, the democratic state must inevitably be democracy for the exploiters.
The state of the exploited must fundamentally differ from such a state; it must he democracy -for the exploited, and a means of sup­ pressing the exploiters; and the suppression of a class means in­ equality for this class, its exclusion from "democracy.
" If we argue in a liberal .
way, we must say: the majority decides, the minority submits.
Those who· do not submit· are punished.
That is alt Nothing need he said about the class character of the state in general, or of "pure democracy" in-particular, becaruie it fs irrelevant; for a majority is a majority and a minority is a minority.
A pound of flesh is a pound of flesh; and that is all there is to it, And this is exactly the way Kautsky argues'.
He says:' " -c : 2) "Why should the rqle of the proletariat as~utiie, ·and iiecessarlJy assume, a form w)lkh is incompatible with.
democracy?" (p.
2lf, .
.
137 very lengthy and very verbose explanation, backed by a quotation from Marx and the election figures of the Paris Commune, to the effect that t~e proletariat is in a majority.
The conclusion is: "A regi_me _wh!ch is so strongly rooted in the masses has not the slightest reason for mfrmgmg democracy.
It cannut always dispense with violence in cases ':"hen.
violence is emplo~ed to ~uppress democracy.
Violence can only be met with v10lence.
But a regime which knows that it has the support of the masses ':"ill employ violence only in order to protect democracy and not to destroy it.
It would be simply committing suicide if it attempted to destroy its own most reliable basis--universal suffrage, that deep source of mighty moral authority" (p.
22).
.
, You see, therefore, that the relation between the exploited and the exploiters has entirely vanished in Kautsky's argument, and all that remains is majority in general, minority in general, demo­ cracy in general, the "pure democracy" with which we are already familiar.
And all this, mark you, is said apropos of the Paris Commune! We will quote Marx and Engels, by way of illustration, to show how they discuss the subject of dictatorship, a propos of the Paris ·Commune: · 1';fARX: "'Yhen the workers.

" ENGELS: "The victorious party" (in the revolution) "must maintain its rule by means of the terror which its arms inspire in the reactionaries: Would the Paris Commune have lasted a single day if it had not made use -of this authority of the armed population against the bourgeoisie?

, pure nonsense.
Kautsky, with the learned air of a most_ learned armchair fool, or with the innocent air of a ten-year-old girl, asks: why do we need a dictatorship when we have a majority? And Marx and Engels explain: In order to break down the resistance of the bourgeoisie; In order to inspire the reactionaries with fear; In order to maintain the authority of the armed people against the bourgeoisie; In order that the proletariat may forcibly suppress its enemies! But Kautsky does not understand these explanations.
Infatuate_d with the "purity" of democracy, failing to perceive its bourgeois character, he "consistently" urges that the majority, since it is the majority, need not "break down the resistance" of the minority, need not "forcibly suppress" it-it is sufficient to suppress cases of infringement of democracy.
Infatuated with the "purity" of democracy, Kautsky unwittingly commits the very little error that all bourgeois democrats always commit, na~ely, he takes_ fo~mal equality (which is only a fraud and hypocrisy under cap1tahsm) for actual equality.
Quite a bagatelle! The exploiter and the exploited cannot be equal.
.
This truth, however unpleasant it may be to Kautsky, is never-thele~s th~ quintessence of socialism.
.
.
.
.
Another truth: there can be no real equality until all poss1b1hty of the exploitation of one class by another has been destroyed.
The exploiters can be defeated at one stroke in the event of a successful insurrection at the centre, or of a mutiny in the army; but except in very rare and particular cases, the exploi~ers cannot be destroyed at one stroke.
It is impossible to expropriate all the landlords· and capitalists of a large country at one stroke.
Further­ more, expropriation afone, as a legal or political act: does ~ot settle the matter by a long way, because it is necessary m practice to remove the landlords and capitalists, in practice to replace their management of the factories and estates by working.
class manage­ ment.
There can be no equality between the expl01ters-who for many generations have enjoyed education and the ad.
vantages and habits of wealth-and the exploited, the majority of whom even unorganised.
For a long.
tm1e after the revolution the :xplo1te~s mevitably continue to enjoy '§l large, n ~~her of.
great practical advantages: they still have money (smce it Is 1mposs1ble to abolish money all at once); some movable prope:ty-:-often fairly considerable; social connections, habits of orgamsation and management, knowledge of all the "secrets" (cu~toms, me~hods, means and possibilities) of management, su­ perior educat~on, close.
connections with the higher technical per­ sonnel (who I.
1ve ar:d thmk like the bourgeoisie), and incomparably greater experience m the art of war (this is very important), and so on, and so forth.

ters a:e defeated in one country only-and this, of course, is typical, smce a simultaneous revolution in a number of co~ntries is a rare exception-they still remain stronger than the exploited, because the international connections of the exploiters ~re e~ormous, The fact that a section of the exploited, or the least mtelhgen~ section of the middle peasant, artisan and similar masses, may and mdeed do follow the exploiters has been proved hitherto by all ~evolutions, including the Commune (for there were also proletarians among the Versailles troops, which the most learned Kautsky seems to have "forgotten").
In these circumstances, to assume that in a revolution that is at .
all profound and serious the issue is decided simply by the re­ !at10n between the majority and the minority is the acme of stupid-1~y, the stupid prejudice of a common or garden liberal, the decep­ ti~n ~l the masses, concealing from them a well-established histon~al truth.
This historical truth is that in every profound revol~t10n; the prolonged-, stubborn, desperate resistance of the exploiters, who for a number of years enjoy important practical ~dv~ntages over th: exploited, is the rule.
Never, except in the senbment~l phantas1es of the sentimental simpleton Kautsky.
will the expl~1ters submit to the decision ofthe e~ploited majorit/with­ _ou~ makmg use of their advantages in a last desperate battle or series of battles.

capitalism to communism hope will be conver~ed into attempts at restoration.
And after their first serious defeat, the overthrown explciiters.

will throw themselves with tenfold energy, with furious passion and hatred grown a hundredfold, info the battle for the recovery of their lost "paradise," on behalf of their families who had been leading such a sweet arid easy life and whom now the "common herd" is condemning to ruin and destitu­ tion (or to "common" work) •.
•• In the wake of the capitalist exploiters will be found the broad masses of the petty bourgeoisie, to whose vacillation and hesitatfon the historical experience of every country for decades bears witness; one day they march behind the proletariat, ·the next day they will take fright at the difficulties of the revolution, become panic-stricken at the first defeat or semi­ defeat of the workers; they become irritable, they run about, snivel and rush from one camp to the other-just like our Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries! And in these circumstances, in the epoch of desperate, acute war, when history is placing the question of the life and death of ·age­ long privilege on the order of the day-at such a time to talk about majority and minority, about pure democracy, about dictatorship being unnecessary and about equality between the exploiter and the exploited! What bottomless stupidity and philistinism are needed· for this! But during the decades of comparatively "peaceful" capitalism, between 1871 and 1914, whole Augean stables of philistinism, im­ becility, and renegacy accumulated in the Socialist parties which were adapting themselves to opportunism.
* * * The reader will probably have noticed that Kautsky, in the passage from his pamphlet quoted above, speaks_ of an attempt to encroach upon universal suffrage (extolling it, by the way, as a deep source of mighty moral authority, whereas Engels, a propos very characteristic difference between the philistine's and the revolutionary's view on "authority")'.

Had Kautsky, cast­ mg aside hypocrisy, entitled his pamphlet Against the Bolsheviks the title would have corresponded to.

The subject dealt with in the first part, from which I quoted, is democra­ cy and dictatorship in general.

and the substitution of the state of the exploited for the exploiters' state.
T?is is the only form in which a theoretician can present the quest10n.

On the basis of this material I examined, for example, the question of de~ocracy and dictatorship in my hook, .

-Ed; specific conditions of the Russian revolution and the specific path of its development.
This will be done later on in this pamphlet.
It would be a mistake, however, to guarantee in advance that the im­ pending proletarian revolutions in Europe will all, or for the most part, be necessarily accompanied by the restriction of the franchise for the bourgeoisie.
Perhaps they will.
After our experience of the war and of the Russian revolution we can say that it will probably be so; but it is not absolutely necessary for the purpose ot ~ealising the dictatorship, it is not an essential symptom of the logical con­ cept "dictatorship,"' it does not enter as an essential condition in the historical and class concept "dictatorship.
" The necessary symptom, the necessary condition of dictator­ ship, is the forcible suppression of the exploiters as a class, and, consequently, the infringement of "pure democracy," i.
e.
, of equali­ tv and freedom for that class.
, Only in this way can the question be put theoretically.
And by failing to put the question in this manner, Kautsky showed that he opposes the Bolsheviks not as a theoretician, but as a sycophant of the opportunists and of the bourgeoisie.
The question in which countries, arid in the presence of what special national features of this or that capitalism, democracy for the exploiters will be infringed upon or restricted (wholly or in part) is a question of the special national featmes of this or that capitalism, of this or that revolution.
The theoretical question is an entirely different one, viz.
, is the dictatorship of the proletariat possible without infringing democracy for the exploiting class? It is precisely this question, the only theoretically important and essential one, that Kautsky has evaded.
He has quoted all sorts of passages from Marx and Engels, except those which relate to this question, and which I quoted above.
Kautsky talks about everything, about everything that is ac· ceptable to liberals and bourgeois democrats and does not go beyond their system of ideas, but he does not talk about the main thing, namely, the fact that the proletariat cannot achieve victory without where tlrere is no "freedom," then~ is, of course, no democracy.
This Kautsky has not understood~ · _ · , * * We shall now examine the experience of the :Russian revolution and of that divergence between.
the· Soviets and the Constituent As­ sembly which led to the dissolution of the latter and to the with­ drawal of the franchise from THE SOVIETS DARE NOT BECOME STATE ORGANISATIONS THE Soviets are the Russian form of the proletarian dictatorship.
If a Marxian theoretician, writing on the dictatorship of the prole­ tariat, had seriously set to work to study the subject (and not merely to repeat the petty-bourgeois lamentations over dictatorship, as Kautsky does in repeating the Menshevik melodies) he would first -0£ all have given a general definition of dictatorship, and would then have examined its peculiar national form, the Soviets; he would have given his critique of them as one of the forms of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
It goes without saying that nothing serious could be expected from Kautsky after his liberal "interpretation" of Marx's theory of the dictatorship; but the manner in which he approached the question of what the Soviets are and the way he dealt with this question is highly characteristic.
The Soviets, he says, recalling their rise in 1905, * created "the most all-embracing [umfassendste] form of proletarian organisation, for it embraced all the wage workers" (p.
31).
In 1905 they were only local bodies; in 1917 they became na­ tional organisations.
Kautsky continues: "The Soviet organisation has already behind it a great and glorious history, and it has a still more mighty future before it, and not in Russia alone.
It appears that everywhere the old methods of the economic and political struggle of the proletariat fail against the gigantic economic and political forces which finance capital has at its disposal.
These old methods cannot be discarded: they are still indispensable for normal times; but from time to time tasks arise which they cannot fulfil, tasks that can be success· fully fulfilled only by a combination of all the political and economic instru­ ments of force of the working class" (p.
32).
10 .
145 is no less necessary than the trade unions-being "useless for the purpose of directing the' mighty class battles that are more and more becoming the sign of the times .
.
.
.
" "Thus," Kautsky concludes, "the Soviet organisation is one of the most important phenomena of our time.
It promises to acquire decisive importance in the great decisive battles between capital and labour towards which we are marching.
"But are we justified in demanding more of the Soviets? After the November [October] Revolution the Bolsheviks, in conjunction with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, secured a majority in the Russian Soviets of Workers' Deputies, and after the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly they set out to transform the Soviets from a milit(JJJ7,t orgrmisation of one class into a state organisation.
They destroyed the democracy which the Russian people had won in the March [February] Revolution.
Accordingly, the Bol­ sheviks have ceased to call themselves Social-Democrats.
They call themselves Communists" (p.
33, Kautsky's italics).
Those who are familiar with Russian Menshevik literature will at once see with what servile fidelity Kautsky copies Martov, Axel­ rod, Stein and Co.
Yes, "servile fidelity," because Kautsky distorts the facts to a ridiculous degree in order to pander to Menshevik prejudices.
Kautsky did not take the trouble, for instance, to ask his informants (Stein of Berlin, or Axelrod of Stockholm) when the questions of changing the name of the Bolsheviks to Communists and of the importance of the Soviets as state -organisations were first raised.
Had Kautsky made this simple inquiry he would not have penned these ridiculous lines, for both these questions were raised by the Bolsheviks in April 1917, for example, in my Theses of April 17 [ 4], 1917,1 i.
e.
, long before the October Revolution of 1917 (and, of course, long before the dissolution of the Constituent As­ sembly on January 18 [5], 1918).
But the passage from Kautsky's argument which I have just quoted in full represents the crux of the whole question about the Soviets.
This crux is the question: should the Soviets aspire to be~ come state organisations (in April 1917 the Bolsheviks put forward 1 See "The Tasks of the Proletariat in the Present Revolution," Selected W arks, Vol.
VI.
-Ed.
fied wi,th a bourgeois parliamentary republic, but demanded a workers' and peasants' republic of the Paris Commune type, or .
Soviet type 2), or should the Soviets not strive for this, sho~ld they refrain from taking political power into their hands, refram from becoming state organisations and remain the "militant organisa­ tions of one class" (as Martov expressed it, plausibly concealing under this innocent desire the fact that under Menshevik leader' ship the Soviets were instruments for the subjection of the work-ers to the bonrgeoisie) ? Kautsky slavishly repeats Martov's words, takes up fragments of the theoretical controversy between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, and uncritically and senselessly transplants them to the general theoretical and European field.
The result is s~ch a mud~le as to provoke Homeric latlghter in every class conscious Russian worker who hears of these arguments of Kautsky.
And when we explain what the question at issue is every work_er in Europe (except a handful of inveterate social-imperialists) will greet Kautsky with the same outburst of laughter.
.
.
.
Kautsky has rendered Martov a backhanded service by r~ducmg his mistake to obvious absurdity.
Let us see what Kautsky s argu, ment amounts to.
.
The Soviets embrace all wage workers.
The old methods of the economic and political struggle of the proletariat are inadequa~e against finance capital.
The Soviets have ~ great role t~ ?lay m the future, and not only in Russia.
They will play a decisive role in the great decisive battles between capital and labour in Europe.
This is what Kautsky says.
Excellent.
But will not the "decisive battles between capital and labour" decide the question as to which of the two classes will possess political power? 1 See "The Tasks of the Proletariat in the Present Revolution," "A Dual Power," and "The Tasks of the Proletariat in Om Revolution," Selected Works, Vol.

10" must not become state organisations in the "decisive" battles.
But what is the state? The state is nothing but a machine for the suppression of one class by another.
Thus, the oppressed class, the vanguard of all the toilers and of the exploited in modern society, must strive towards the "decisive battles between capital and labour," but must not touch the machine by means of which capital oppresses labour! It must not break up that machine! It must not make use of its all.
embracing organisa­ tion for the purpose of suppressing the exploiters! Excellent, magnificent, Mr.
Kautsky ! "We" recognise the class struggle, in the same way as all liberals recognise it, i.
e.
, without the overthrow of the bourgeoisie1 This is where Kautsky's complete rupture with Marxism and with Socialism becomes obvious.
Practically, it is desertion to the camp of the bourgeoisie which is prepared to concede everything except the transformation of the organisations of the class which it oppresses into state organisations.
Kautsky can no longer save his position of trying to reconcile everything and to brush aside all profound contradictions with mere phrases.
Kautsky either rejects the transition of political power to the working class; or he concedes that the working class may take over the old bourgeois state machine; but he does not concede that it must break up, smash that machine and replace it by a new, prole­ tarian one.
Whichever way Kautsky's arguments are "interpreted" or "explained," his rupture with Marxism and his desertion to the bourgeoisie are obvious.
Describing what sort of state the victorious working class needs, Marx, already in The Communist Manifesto, wrote: "A state, that is, the proletariat organised as the ruling class.
" Now a man who claims that he is still a Marxist comes on the scene and declares that the proletariat, organised to a man and waging the "decisive battle" against capital, must not transform its class organisation into a state organisation! Here Kautsky has betrayed that "superstitious -belief in the state" which in Germany, philistine "agrees" to this (as every bourgeois "agrees,'' since the workers are already fighting and the only thing he can do is to devise means for blunting the edge of their sword).
Fight, but don't dare win! Don't destroy the state machine of the bourgeoisie; don't put the proletarian "state organisation" in the place of the bour­ geois "state organisation"! Whoever sincerely shares the Marxian view that the state is nothing but a machine for the suppression of one class by an­ other, and who has at all reflected upon this truth, could never have reached the absurd conclusion that the proletarian organisa­ tions capable of defeating finance capital must not become trans­ formed into state organisations.
It was this point that betrayed the petty bourgeois who believed that "after all is said and done" the state is something that is outside of class, or stands above class.
Indeed, why should the proletariat, "one class," be permitted to wage determined war against capital, which rules not only over the proletariat, but over the whole people, over the whole of the pet~y bourgeoisie, over the whole of the peasantry, but why should this proletariat, this "one class," not be permitted to transform i~s organisation into a state organisation? Because the petty bourgeois is afraid of the class struggle, and does not carry it to its logical conclusion, to its main object.
Kautsky has got himself completely mixed up and has given himself away entirely.
Mark you, he himself admits that Europe is marching towards dec;isive battles between capital and labour, and that the old methods of the economic and political struggle of the proletariat are inadequate.
But these old methods were precisely the utilisation of bourgeois democracy.
Hence? .
.
.
But Kautsky fears to think this out to its logical concl~sion.
.
.
.
Hence, only a reactionary, only an enemy of the working class, only a henchman of the bourgeoisie, can at the present time turn his face to the obsolete past, depict the charms of bour­ geois democracy and babble about pure democracy_.
Bourgeois democracy was progressive compared.
with medirevalism, and.
it was necessary to utilise it.
But now it is inadequate for the workmg proletarian democracy for bourgeois democracy.
And although the preparatory work for the proletarian,revolution, the formation and the training of the proletarian army, was possible (and necessary) within the framework of the bourgeois-democratic state, now that we have reached the stage of "decisive battles" to confine the pro­ letariat to this framework means betraying the cause of the prole· tariat, means being a renegade.
Kautsky has made himself particularly ridiculous by repeating Martov's argument without noticing that Martov's argument was based on another argument which he, Kautsky, does not use! Martov said (and Kautsky repeats it) that Russia was not yet ripe for socialism.
From this it logi_cally followed that it was too early to transform the Soviets from organs of struggle into state organisa· tions (read it is quite time to transform the Soviets, with the assistance of the Menshevik leaders, into instruments for subjecting the workers to the imperialist bourgeoisie).
Kautsky, however, cannot say openly that Europe is not ripe for socialism.
In 1909, when he was not yet a renegade, he wrote that there was no reason to fear a premature revolution, that whoever renounced revolution for fear of defeat would be a traitor.
Kautsky does not dare renounce this openly.
And so we get the following absurdity, which utterly betrays the stupidity and cowardice of the petty bourgeois: on the one hand, Europe is ripe for socialism and is marching towards decisive battles between capital and labour; on the other hand, the fighting organisation (i.
e.
, the organisation which is formed, grows .
up and becomes strong in battle), the.
o.
rganisation of the prole­ tariat, the vanguard, the organiser and the leader of the oppressed, must not be transformed into a state organisation! * * * From the point of view of practical politics the idea that the Soviets are necessary as fighting organisations bat must not be transformed into state organisations is infinitely morfl absurd than from the P?int of view of theory.
Even in peace time, when there is no revolutionary situati?l_l, the mass struggle of the workers against the capitalists~for instance, a mass strike-causes great to the bourgeoisie insisting on remaining "master in its own house," etc.
But in time of revolution, when political life reaches boiling point, an organisation like the Soviets, which embraces all workers, all industries, all the soldiers, and all the toiling and poorest sec­ tions of the rural population-such an organi~ation, in the course of the struggle, by the simple logic of attack and defence, automatical­ ly has to raise the question of power point blank.
The attempt to take up a middle position and lo "reconcile" the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is sheer stupidity and is doomed to miserable failure.
This is what happened in Russia to the preachings of Martov and other Mensheviks and this will inevitably happen in Germany and other countries if the Soviets succeed in developing -0n a fairly wide scale, manage to unite and become consolidated.
To say to the Soviets: fight, but do not take political power entirely in your hands, do not become state organisations-is tantamount to preaching collaboration of classes and "social peace" between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.
It is ridiculous to think that such a --~----­ position in the midst of fierce struggie could lead to -anything but disgraceful failure.
But it is Kautsky's everlasting fate to sit between two stools.
He pretends that he does not agree with the opportunists on anything in theory, but in practice he agrees with them on every-thing that is essential (i.
e.
, on everything that pertains to revolu-tion).

Let us see how our "Marxist theo­ retician.
has dealt with the question.
He quotes my "Theses on the Constituent Assembly " which were p 1ublished in th~ Pravda of January 8, 1918 [Dece:Uber 26, 1917] · One would thmk that no better evidence of Kautsky's seri­ ous approach to the subject and of his willingness to study the documents could he desired.
But observe how he quotes.
He does not say that there were nineteen of these theses; he does not say that they <le~lt with ~e q~estion of the relation between the ordinary bour?eo1s repuhhc with ~ Constituent Assembly and a Soviet re­ public, as wel~ as with the history of the divergence, in the course of ou: revolut10n, between the Constituent Assembly and the dicta­ torship of the proletariat.
Kautsky suppresses all that and simply tells the reader that "two of these" (theses) "are 't.

is not only the form of a higher type of demo­ cratic institution (as compared with the ordinary bourgeois republic crowned with a Constituent Assembly) but it is the only form capable of securing: the most painless transition 1 to socialism" (Kautsky omits the word "ordinary" and the introductory words of the thesis: "For the transition from the bourgeois to the socialist order, for the dictatorship of the pro-letariat").
After quoting these words, Kautsky, with magnificent irony, exclaims: "It is a pity that this conclusion was arrived at only after the Bolsheviks found themselves in a minority in the Constituent Assembly.
Before that no one had demanded it more clamorously than Lenin.
" This is literally what Kauts:(y says on page 31 of his book! It is positively a gem! Only a sycophant of the bourgeoisie could present the question so falsely as to give the reader the impression that all the Bolsheviks' talk about a higher type of state .
was an invention which saw the light of day after they found them-.
~· selves in the minority in the Constituent Assembly.
Such an infam-ous lie could only have been uttered by a scoundrel who has sold himself to the bourgeoisie, or, what is absolutely the same thing, who has placed his trust in P.
Axelrod and is concealing the source of his information.
Everyone knows that on the very day of my arrival in Russia, on April 17 [4], 1917, I publicly read my theses 2 in which I pro· claimed the superiority of the Paris Commune type of state over the bourgeois parliamentary republic.
Afterwards, I repeatedly 1 Incidentally, Kautsky, with an obvious attempt at sarcasm, repeatedly quotes the expression "most painless" transition; but as the shaft misses its mark, he a few pages further on commits a slight forgery and falsely quotes­ it as "painless transition.
" Of course, by such means it is easy to put any absurdity into the mouth of an opponent.
The forgery also facilitates the evasion of the substance of the argument, namely, that the most painless­ transition to socialism is possible only when all the poor are organised (Soviets) and when the central state power (of the proletariat) helps to organise them.
2 See "The Tasks of the Prolftariat in the Present Revolution," Selected Works, Vol, VL-Ed, stated this in print, as, for instance, in a pamphlet on political parties, which was translated into English and was published in January 1918 in the New York E-1'.

Moreover, the con­ ference of the Bolshevik Party hell at the end of April [beginning of May] 1917 adopted a resolution to the effect that a proletarian and p~asant republic was higher than a bourgeois parlia1nentary republic, that our Party would not he satisfied with the latter, and that the programme of the Party ought to be amended accordingly.
In face of these facts, what name can be given to Kautsky's trick of as~uring his Germ~n readers that I had been clamorously de­ mandmg the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, and that I began to "belittle" the honour and dignity of the Constituent As­ sembly· after the Bolsheviks found themselves in the minority in it? How can one excuse such a trick? 2 By pleading that Kautsky did not know the facts? If that is the case, why did he undertake· to write about the subject? Or why did he not honestly declare that he was writing on the strength of information supplied by the Men­ s~eviks, by Stein, P.

) In order to represent the Bolsheviks as being devoid of all prin­ -ci ples, as "revolutionary opportunists" (this is a te~m w~ch Kautsky employs somewhere in his hook in some connect10n which I do not remember), Mr.
Kautsky has concealed from his German readers the fact that the theses contain a direct reference to "re-peated" declarations! Such are the petty, miserable and contemptible methods Mr.
Kautsky employs! That is the way he has evaded the theoretical question.
Is it true or not that the bourgeois-democratic parliamentary republic is a lower form of republic than that of the Paris Commune or Soviet type? This is the crux of the question, and Kautsky has evaded it.
Kautsky has "forgotten" all that Marx said in his analysis of the Paris Commune.
He has also "forgotten" Engels'.
letter to Behel of March 28, 1875, in which Marx's idea is formulated in a terse and clear fashion: "The Commune was no longer a state in the proper sense of the word.
" .
' Here is the most prominent theoretician of the Second Interna-tional, in a special pamphlet on the Dictatorship of the Proletariat specially dealing with Russia, where the question of a state that was hio-her than a democratic bourgeois republic has been raised re' 0 peatedly in a direct manner, ignoring this very question.
In what way does this differ in fact from desertion to the bourgeois camp? (We will observe in parenthesis that in this respect also Kautsky is merely following in the footsteps of the Russian Mensheviks.
Among the latter there are any number of people who know "all the quotations" from Marx and Engels; but not a single· Menshevik mune type of state.
Plekhanov, too, has evaded the question.
He thought it wiser to remain silent.
) '· It goes without saying that to discuss the dispersal of the Con­ stituent Assembly with i)ersons who call themselves Socialists and Marxists, but who in practice desert to the bourgeoisie on the main question, on the question of the Paris Commune type of state, would be casting pearls before swine.
It will be sufficient for me to give the complete text of n:;y theses on the Constituent Assembly as an appendix to the present book.
1 The reader will then see that the question was presented on January 8, 1918 [December 26, 1917], theoretically, historically, and from the point of view of practical politics.
If Kautsky has completely renounced Marxism as a theoretician he might at least have examined the question of the struggle of the Soviets with the Constituent Assembly as a historia~.
We know from many of Kautsky's works that he could be a Marxian historian, and that these works of his will remain the permanent treasure of the proletariat in spite of his subsequent renegacy.
But on this question Kautsky turns away from the truth even as a his­ torian, he ignores well-known facts and behaves like a sycophant.
He wants to represent the Bolsheviks as being devoid of principles and he tells his readers that they tried to allay their conflict with the Constituent Assembly before dispersing it.
This is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of; we have no need to recant: I give my theses in full and there I say as clear as clear can be: Gentlemen of the vacillating petty bourgeoisie who have got into the Constitu­ ent Assembly, either reconcile yourselves to the proletarian dicta­ torship, or else we shall conquer you by "revolutionary means" (theses 18 and 19).
That is how a really revolutionary proletariat has always be­ haved, and always will behave towards the vacillating petty bour­ geoisie.
Kautsky adopts a formal standpoint on the question of the 1 See Selected Works, Vol.
VI,-Erl.
nghts -0f the Constituent Assembly (theses 16 and 17).
The formal dem~­ cratic point of view is precisely the point of view of the bourge~is democrat who refuses to admit that the interests of the proletariat and of the proletarian class struggle are supreme.
As a ~istori~n, Kautsky would not have been able to deny that bourgeois parh~­ ments are the organs of this or that class; but now ~for the sordid purpose of renouncing revolution) Kautsky finds it nec~ssary to forget his Marxism, and he refrains from p~tting the ques~on: what ,class was the Constituent Assembly of Russia the organ of.
Kautsky does not examine the concrete conditions; he does not want to face ·the facts; he does not say a single word to his Ger.
man rea~ers_ to suggest that my theses contained, not only a theoretic~l elucidat10n <>f the question of the limited character of bourgeois.
~emocr~cy {theses 1-3), not only an outline of the concrete c?nditi~ns ~vhich determined the discrepancy between the party candidate lists lll the middle of October 1917 and the real state of affairs in December 1917 (theses 4-6), but also a history of the class struggle a~d the •civil war in October-December 1917 (theses 7-15).
From this con· crete history we drew the conclusion (thesis 14) that ~he slogan: «All power to the Constituent Assembly" * had, i~ reality, become the slogan of the Cadets, the Kaledinites,.
and theu abettor~.
.
Kautsky, the historian, fails to see this.
_Kauts:(y, the h1.
stonan, has never heard that universal suffrage gives nse sometimes to Jletty-bourgeois, sometimes to reactionary and sor~1etim~s to .
counter· revolutionary parliaments.
Kautsky, the Marxian h1stonan, has never heard that the method of elections and the form of democracy are one thing, and the class content of the given insti.
tuti?n is another thing.
This question of the class content of the Constituent Assembly is directly put and answered in my theses.
Perhaps my answer is wrong.
Nothing would have been more welcome th~~ a Marxian criticism of our analysis by an outsider.
Instead of wntmg silly phrases (of which there are plenty in Kautsky's book~ about somebody, somehow, preventing the criticism of Bolshi:v1s:n, he ·ought to have set out to make such a criticism.
But the pomt is that :he has no criticism to offer.
He does not even raise the question of to argue, to debate with Kautsky; and ali we can do is to prove to the reader why Kautsky cannot he called by any other name than renegade.
, The ~ive~gence between the Soviets and the Constituent Assem­ hl~ has it~ history, which even a historian who does not adopt the pomt of view of the class war could not ignore.
Kautsky would not e~en touch upon this factual history.
Kautsky has concealed from h~s.
German readers the universally known fact (which only mali­ c10~s Mensheviks now suppress) that the divergence between the· So_v1ets and the "state" (that is, the bourgeois state) institutions existed even when the Mensheviks predominated, from the end of February to October 1~1_7 .
.
Actually, Kautsky adopts the position of an advocate of conc1hat10n, compromise and collaboration b _ tween the p~ol:t~riat and the bourgeoisie.
However much Kautsk~ may deny this, it 1s a fact which is borne out by his whole pamphlet.
To say_ that the Constituent Assembly should not have been dis­ persed Is tantamount to saying that the :fight against the bourgeoisie should not have been fought to a finish, thaJ the bourgeoisie should not have been overthrown and that tbe proletariat should have become reconciled with it.
.
Why has Kautsky said nothing about the fact that the Menshe­ v1ks were engaged i~ this ing~orious work between February and ()ctohe.
r 1917 and did not achieve anything? If it was possible to reconcil~ the bourgeoisie with the proletariat why did not the Menshev1ks succeed_ in doing so? Why did the bourgeoisie stand aloof from the Soviets? Why did the M ensheviks call the S · t " I · ov1e s rev? uti~nary democracy,"* and the bourgeoisie the "property quah:ficat10n elements"? ~autsky has concealed from his German readers that it was precisely the Mensheviks who, in the "epoch" of their predomin­ ance (February to October 1917), called the Soviets "revolution­ ary democracy," thereby admitting the superiority of the Soviets o:er ~II other institutions.
It is only by concealing this fact that the h1stonan Kauts~y was able to make it appear that the divergence ~etween the Soviets and the bourgeoisie had no history, that it arose instantaneously, suddenly, ~it.
hout cause, because of the bad experience of the Menshevik policy of compromise, of attempts to reconcile the proletariat with the bourgeoisie, that convinced the people of the fruitlessness of these attempts and drove the prole· tariat away from the Mensheviks.
Kautsky admits that the Soviets are an excellent fighting organ­ isation of the proletariat, and that they have a great future before them.
But, that being the case, Kautsky's position collapses like a house of cards, or like the dreams of a petty bourgeois who believes that the acute struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie: can be avoided.
For revolution is a continuous desperate struggle, and the proletariat is the vanguard class of all the oppressed, the focus and centre 0£ all the aspirations of all the oppressed who are striving for emancipation! Naturally, therefore, the Soviets, as the organ of struggle of the oppressed masses, reflected and expressed the moods and changes of opinions of these masses ever so much more quickly, more fully, and more faithfully than any other insti­ tution (that, incidentally, is one of the reasons why Soviet democracy is the highest type of democracy).
In the period between March 13 [February 28] and November 7 [October 25], 1917, the Soviets managed to convene two All-Russian Congresses of representatives of the overwhelming majority of the population of Russia, of all the workers and soldiers, and 70 or 80 per cent of all the peasantry; not to speak of the vast number of local, district, urban, provincial, and regional congresses.
During .
this period the bourgeoisie did not succeed in convening a single institution that represented the majority of the people (except that obvious sham and mockery called the "Democratic Conference,"* which enraged the proletariat).
The Constituent Assembly reflected· the same mood of the masses and the same political groups as were reflected by the first (June) All-Russian Congress of Soviets.
About .
the time the Constituent Assembly was convened (January 1918), the Second and Third Congresses of Soviets met (in November [Oc­ tober] 1917, and January 1918, respectively) and both demon­ strated as clear as clear can be that the masses had swung to the Left, had become revolutionised, "had turned away from the Mensheviks ship, from the illusion that it was possible to reach a compromise with the bourgeoisie, and joinefl.
the proletarian revolutionary struggle for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie.
Hence, even the external history of the Soviets shows that the -dispersal of the Constituent Assembly was inevitable and that this Assembly was a reactionary body.
But Kautsky sticks firmly to his motto: let "pure democracy" prevail though the revolution perish and the bourgeoisie triumph -over the proletariat! Fiat justitia, pereat mundus!

uggl,l?,; Of course, Kautsky, the historian, failed t~ observe this: H(dailed to understand that even when the Mensheviks the advocates of compromise with the bourgeoisie, predominated i~ the Soviets, the bourgeoisie of its own accord separated itself from the Soviets, boycotted them, put itself up in opposition to them and intrigued against them.
The Soviets arose without any constitution and existed for more than twelve months (from the spring of 1917 to the summer of 1918) without any constitution.
The rage of the bourgeoisie against these independent and omnipotent (because all­ embracing) organisations of the oppressed; the unscrupulous, self­ seeking and despicable fight the bourgeoisie waged against the Soviets; and, lastly, the overt participation of the bourgeoisie-­ from the Cadets to the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, from Milvu­ kov to Kerensky-in the Kornilov mutiny, all paved the way for the formal exclusion of the bourgeoisie from the Soviets.
Kautsky has heard about this Kornilov mutiny, but he majestical­ ly ~corns hist?rical facts and the course and forms of the struggle which determmed the forms of the dictatorship.
Indeed, what have :ac~s.
~ot ,~o do wit? "pur~ democracy"? That is why Kautsky's c~1t1c1sm ?f t~e d1sfranch1sement of the bourgeoisie is so sweetly ~a1ve-a naivete that would he touching in a child but is repulsive m a person who has not yet been officially certified as being feeble­ minded.
11 161 Charming, is it not? Clever Kautsky has seen many cases in history, and, of course, knows perfectly well from his observations· of life, that there are landlords and capitalists who giv~ considera­ tion to the will of the majority of the oppressed.
Clever Kautsky firmly adopts the point of view of an "opposition," i.
e.
, the point 0of view of the parliamentary struggle.
This is literally what he says; "opposition" (p.
34 and elsewhere).
·;;, Oh, learned historian and politician! It would not be amiss for you to know that "opposition" is a concept that belongs to the peace­ ,.
ful and only to the parliamentary struggle, i.
e.
, a concept that cor­ :responds to a non-revolutionary situation, a concept that corresponds to a situation marked by an absence of revolution.
During revolution we have to deal with a ruthless enemy in civil war; and no reaction­ ary jeremiads of a petty bourgeois who fears such a war as Kautsky does will alter the fact.
To regard the problems of ruthless civil war, when the bourgeoisie is prepared to commit any crime--the example of the Versaillese and their deals with Bismarck.
* must mean something to every P.
erson who does not treat history in the way it was treated by Gogol's Petrushka 1-when the bourgeoisie summons foreign states to its assistance and intrigues with them against the revolution-to regard these problems in this way is simply comical.
Like the "muddle-headed counsellor" Kautsky, the revolutionary proletariat should put on a night cap and regard the bourgeoisie, which is organising Dutov, Krasnov and Czecho-Slovak counter-revolutionary insurrections ''"* and which is spending mil­ lions to subsidise saboteurs, as a legal "opposition.
" Oh, what profundity! Kautsky is interested only in the formal, legal aspect of the question, and his disquisitions on the Soviet constitution involuntar­ ily recall Bebel's words: "Lawyers are thorough reactionaries.
" Kautsky writes: .
_"In reality the capitalists alone cannot he disfranchised.
What is a capital-1st.
m the legal sense of the term? A property owner? Even in a country which has advanced so far along the path of economic progress as Germany, 1 A character in Gogol's Dead Souls, an ignorant serf who mechanically read books syllable by syllable without understanding their meaning.
-Ed.
the number of persons in the German Empire engaged in the three great groups of occupa­ tion-agriculture, industry and commerce-together with their families amounted roughly to thirty-five million in the wage earners' and salaried employees' group, and seventeen million in the independent group.
Hence, a party could well have a majority among the wage workers, hut a minority among the population as a whole" (p.
33).
This is an example of Kautsky's arguments.
Is it not the counter­ revolutionary whining of a bourgeois? Why have you, Mr.
Kautsky, relegated all in the "independent" group to the category of the dis­ franchised, when you know very well that the overwhelming major­ ity of the Russian peasants do not employ hired labour, and do not, therefore, lose their political rights? Is this not falsification? \Y/hy do you not, oh learned economist, quote the facts with which you are perfectly familiar and which are to be found in the very same German statistical returns for 1907 relating to hired labour in agriculture according to the size of farms? Why do you not quote these facts for the benefit of the German workers, the· readers of your pamphlet, and thus enable them to see how many exploiters there are, how small is the number of exploiters out of the total number of "farmers" who figure in German statistics? Because your renegacy has transformed you into a mere syco­ phant of the bourgeoisie.
The term capitalist, don't you see, is a legally vague concept, and Kautsky for the space of several pages hurls his wrath against the "tyranny" of the Soviet constitution.
This "serious scholar" has no objection to the British bourgeoisie taking several centuries to work out a new (new for the Middle Ages) bourgeois constitution, but this representative of lackey's science will not give any time to us, the workers and peasants of Russia.
He expects us to have a constitution all complete to the very last word in a few months.
"Tyranny!" Think what a depth of mean subserviency to the bourgeoisie and of the most idiotic pedantry is contained in such a reproach.
When thoroughly bourgeois and, for the most part, reactionary lawyers in the capitalist countries have for centuries or decades been drawing up most detailed rules and regulations and ·writing hundreds of volumes of various codes and laws and inter-· 11 * hand and foot and to place a hundred and one hindrances and obstacles in the way of the common toiling people--oh, then bour­ geois liberals and Mr.
Kautsky see no "tyranny.
" This is "law" and "order": the ways in which the poor are to be "kept down" have all been thought out and written down.
There are thousands and thou­ sands of bourgeois lawyers and bureaucrats (Kautsky says nothing about them, probably for the very reason that Marx attached enor­ mous significance to the smashing of the bureaucratic machine .
.
.
) -lawyers and bureaucrats who are able to interpret the laws in such a way that the worker and the average peasant can never break tii.
rough the barbed-wire entanglements of these laws.
This, of course, is not the "tyranny" of the bourgeoisie, it is not the dictatorship of the sordid and self-seeking exploiters who are sucking the blood of the people.
Oh, nothing of the kind! It is "pure democracy,'' which is becoming purer and purer every day.
But now that the toiling and exploited classes, for the first time in history, while cut off by the imperialist war from their brothers across the frontier, have set up their own Soviets, have called to the work of political construction those masses which the bourgeoisie used to oppress and stupefy, and have begun themselves to build up a new, proletarian state, have begun in the heat of furious struggle, in the fire of civil war, to sketch the fundamental principles of a state without exploiters-all the scoundrelly bourgeoisie, the whole gang of blood-suckers with Kautsky echoing them, howl about "tyranny.
" Indeed, how will these ignorant people, these workers and peasants this "mob,'' be able to interpret their laws? How can these common toilers acquire the sense of justice without the aid of educated lawyers, of bourgeois writers, of the Kautsky and the wise old bureaucrats? Mr.
Kautsky quotes from my speech of April 29, 1918, the words: · "The masses themselves determine the procedure and the time of elections.
" And Kautsky, the "pure democrat,'' infors from this: "Hence.
it would mean that .
e.
very assembly of electors may determine the (p.
37).
well, what is the difference between these remarks and the talk of the hired capitalist hack journalist who howls about the tyranny h "" d .
" k h " ·11 of the masses who oppress t e m ustnous wor ers w o are w1 -ing to work" during a strike? Why is the bureaucratic and bourgeois method of determining electoral procedure under "pure," bourgeois democracy not tyranny? Why should the sense of justice among the masses who have risen to fight their age-long exploiters and who are being educated and hardened in this desperate str?ggle be lower than that of a handful of bureaucrats, intellectuals and lawyers who are steeped in bourgeois prejudices? Kautsky is a true Socialist.
Don't dare suspect the sincerity of this very respectable father of a family, of this very honest citizen.
He is an ardent and convinced supporter of the victory of the workers, of the proletarian revolution.
All he wants is that the_ sentimental petty-bourgeois and philistine intellectuals in night caps should, first-before the masses begin to move, before they enter into furious battle with the exploiters, and certainly without civil war-draw up a moderate and exact set of rules for the development of the revolution.
· Burning with profound moral indignation, our most learned Yudushka Golovlev 1 tells the German workers that on April 14, 1918, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets decided to expel the representatives of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks from the Soviets.
* He says: "This measure is not directed against definite persons guilty of definite punishable offences.
.
.
.
The constitution of the Soviet Republic does not contain a single word about the immunity of Soviet deputies.
It is not definite persons, but definite parties, that are expelled from the Soviets" (p.
37).
Yes, this is really awful; an intolerable departure from pure democracy, according to the rules of which our revolutionary Yu­ dushka Kautsky will make a revolution.
We Russian Bolsheviks should first of all have guaranteed immunity for the Savinkovs and 1 A character in Shchedrin's novel The Golovlev Family personifying the pious hypocrite.
-Ed.
claiming participation in the Czecho-Slovak counter-revolutionarv war,* or an alliance with the German imperialists in the Ukrain~ or in Georgia against the workers of this country, to be "punishable offences," and only then, on the basis of this criminal code should we have been justified, in accordance with the principles ~f "pure democracy," in expelling "definite persons" from the Soviets.
It goes without saying that the Czecho-Slovaks, who were subsidised by the .
i?-nglo-French capitalists through the medium, or thanks to the agitation of the Savinkovs, Potresovs and Lieberdans, and the ~rasnovs, who received shells from the Germans through the me­ di~ of the :Ukrainian and Tiflis Mensheviks, would have sat quietly wa1tmg until we were ready with our proper criminal code and like the purest democrats, would have confined themselves ~o th~ role of an "opposition.
" No less moral indignation is aroused in Kautsky's breast by the fact that the Soviet constitution disfranchises all those who "em­ ploy hired labour with a view to profit.
" He writes: "A worker working in his own home or a small master employing only one journeyman, may live and feel ~uite like a proletarian, bnt he has no vote!" (p.
36).
What a depart:i-re from "pure democracy"! What injustice! Up to now all Marxists have thought-and thousands of facts have prove? it-tha~ the small masters were the most unscrupulous and graspmg exploiters of hired labour, but our Yudushka Kautsky takes the small masters not as a class (who invented the pernicious theory of the class struggle?) but as single individuals exploiters who "l" d f l · ' ive an ee qmte like proletarians.
" The famous "thrifty Agnes," · whom we had thought dead for a long time, has come to life again under Kautsky's pen.
This "thrifty Agnes" was invented and set 1 A nickname.

• ities that were to result from the dictatorship of the proletariat, from the confiscation of the capital of the exploiters, and used to ask with an innocent air: who was a capitalist in the legal sense -0£ the term? He took as an example a poor, thrifty seamstress ("thrifty Agnes"), who was robbed of her last farthing by the wicked "dictators of the proletariat.
" There was a time when the whole of German Social-Democracy poked fun at this "thrifty Ag­ nes" of the pure democrat, Eugen Richter.
But that was a long, long time ago, when Behel was still alive and when he used to declare frankly and truthfully that there were many National-Liberals in our party; that was very long ago, when Kautsky was not yet a renegade.
Now "thrifty Agnes" has come to life again, in the person of the "small master who lives and feels quite like a proletarian," and who employs "only one" journeyman.
The wicked Bolsheviks are ill-treating this small master, are depriving him of his vote! It is __ true that "every assembly of electors," as Kautsky tells us, may, in the Soviet Republic, admit into its midst a poor little master who, for instance, may be connected with this or that factory, if, by way of an exception, he is not an exploiter, and if he really "lives and feels quite like a proletarian.
" But can one rely only on the knowledge of life, the sense of justice of an irregular factory meeting of common workers acting (oh horror!) without a written code? Clearly, would it not be better to grant the vote to all the exploiters, to all those who employ hired labour, rather than risk the possibility of "thrifty Agnes" and the "small master who lives and feels quite like a proletarian" being wronged by the workers? .

This organ of the Stock Exchange is satisfied, and no wonder.
At the same time a comrade writes to me from Berlin stating that the V orwarts,.
the organ of the Scheide­ manns, has in a special article subscribed to almost every line Kautsky has written.
Congratulations! ers of Europe and the Scheidemanns and Kautskys, the Renaudels and Longuets, the Hendersons and MacDonalds, and all the old leaders and old betrayers of socialism.
The masses of the oppressed classes, the class conscious and honest revolutionary proletarian leaders, will be on our side.
It will be sufficient for such proletarians and such masses to become ac­ quai~ted with our Soviet constitution for them to say at once: "These are mdeed o~r people; theirs is a real workers' party, theirs is a real_ workers governm_ent, for it does not deceive the workers by talkmg about reforms in the way the above-mentioned leaders have done; it ~s re~ll! fighting the exploiters, it is really bringing about a revolution, 1t is really fighting for the complete emancipation of the working class.
" The fact that after twelve months' "experience" the Soviets are depriving the exploiters of the franchise shows that the Soviets are really organisations of the oppressed masses and -not of social­ imperialists and social-pacifists who have sold themselves to the bourgeoisie.

"Kautsky's pamphlet is almost unknown here,'' a well-informed comrade in ~erlin wrote to me a few days ago (today is October 30).
I wo_uld advise our ambassadors in Germany and Switzerland not to st~nt a thousand or so in buying up this book and distributing it gratis among the class conscious workers in order that this "Euro­ pean"-read imperialist and reformist--Social-Democracy which has long been a "stinking corpse," may be trampled in the mud.
* * * At the end of his book, on pages 61 and 63, Mr.
Kautsky bitterly laments over the fact that "the new theory" (as he calls Bolshevism fearing even to touch Marx's and Engels' analysis of the Paris Com~ I t understand how this theory can be adopted by German Social-Democrats.
" No, it is quite easy to understand; for after the serious lessons of the war the revolutionary masses are becoming sick and tired of the Scheidemanns and the Kautskys.
"We" have always been in favour of democracy, Kautsky writes; can we suddenly renounce it? "We," the opportunists of Social-Democracy, have always been opposed to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and Kolb and Co.
proclaimed this long ago.
Kautsky knows this and it is futile for him to imagine that he can conceal from his readers the obvious­ fact that he has "returned to the fold" of the Bernsteins and Kolbs.
"We," the ·revolutionary Marxists, have nevf'r made an idol of "pure" (bourgeois) democracy.
As is well known, in 1903 Plekha­ nov was a revolutionary Marxist (before his lamentable turn, which brought him to the position of a Russian Scheidemann) .
In that year Plekhanov declared at the congress of our Party, which was­ then adopting its programme, that in the revolution the proletariat would, if necessary, disfranchise the capitalists and disperse any parliament that was found to be counter-revolutionary.
That this is the only view that corresponds to Marxism will be clear to any--body even from the statements of Marx and Engels which.
I have quoted· above; it follows logically from all the fundamental prin­ ciples of Marxism.
"We," the revolutionary Marxists, never made the speeches to the people that are made by the Kautskyans of all nations, who cringe before the bourgeoisie, adapt themselves to bourgeois par­ liamentarism, are silent about the bourgeois character of modern democracy and demand only its extension, demand that it be carried to its logical conclusion.
"We" said to the bourgeoisie: "You, exploiters and hypocrites, talk about democracy while at every step you create a thousand and one obstacles to prevent the oppressed masses from taking part in politics.
We take you at your word and in the interests of these­ rnasses we demand the extension of your bourgeois democracy in order to prepare the masses for revolution for the purpose of over-throwing you, the exploiters.
And if you exploiters attempt to offer .
resistance to our proletarian revolution we shall ruthlessly suppress you; we shall deprive you of your rights; more than that, we shall not give you any bread, for in our proletarian republic the ex­ ploiters will have no rights, they will be deprived of fire and water, for we are Socialists in real earnest, and not the Scheidemann or Kautsky type of Socialist.
" That is what "we,'' the revolutionary Marxists, said, and shall say-and that is why the oppressed masses will support us and be with us, while the Scheidemanns and the Kautskys will be swept into the renegades' cesspool.
I /.
WHAT IS INTERNATIONALISM? KAUTSKY is quite convinced that he is an· internationalist and calls himself such.
The Scheidemanns he calls "government Socialists.
" But in defending the Mensheviks (he does not openly express his solidarity with them, but he entirely expresses their views), Kautsky has glaringly revealed the sort of "internationalism" he subscribes to.
And since Kautsky is not alone, but is the representative of a trend which inevitably grew up in the atmosphere of the Second International (Longuet in France, Turati in Italy, Nobs and Grimm, Grabber and Naine in Switzerland, Ramsay MacDonald in England, etc.
), it will be instructive to dwell on Kautsky's "internationalism.
" After emphasising that the Mensheviks also attended the Zim­ merwald Conference (a diploma, certainly, but a tainted diploma), _ ___­ Kautsky sets forth the views of the Mensheviks, with whom he agrees, in the following manner: "The Mensheviks wanted a general peace.
They wanted all the bel­ ligerents to adopt the formula: No annexations and no indemnities.
The Russian army was to stand ready for battle until this had been achieved.
The Bolsheviks, on the other hand, demanded an immediate peace at any price; they were prepared, if need be, to make a separate peace; they tried to extort it by force by increasing the state of disorganisation of the army, which was already bad enough" (p.
27).
In Kautsky's opinion the Bolsheviks should not have taken power, and should have been satisfied with the Constituent Assembly.
Thus, the internationalism of Kautsky and the Mensheviks amounted to this: to demand reforms from the imperialist bour­ geois government, but to continue to support it, and to continue to support the war that this government was waging until all the bel­ ligerents had accepted the formula: No annexations and no in­ demnities.
This view was repeatedly expressed by Turati and by the Kautskyans (Haase and others), and Longuet and Co.
, who declared that ther stood for "defence of the fatherland.
" 171 Theoretically, this is complete inability to dissociate oneself from the social-chauvinists and complete confusion on the question of the defence of the fatherland.
Politically, it is the substitution of petty-bourgeois nationalism for i.
Ilternationalism, and desertion to the reformists' cam , the renunciation of revolution.
jf if~j~~!~1~'r!i:~~~cefi~~~~~t1r~~;~ an admission that it is legitimate~ And since the war remains an imperialist war, both u.
nder a monarchy and under a republic, irrespective of the territory-mine or the enemy's-occupied by the enemy troops at the given moment, the recognition of the defence of the fatherland is, in fact, tantamount to supporting the imperial­ ist predatory bourgeoisie, it is tantamount to the utter betrayal of socialism.
ln Russia, even under Kerensky, under the bourgeois­ democratic republic, the war continued to be an imperialist war, for it was being waged by the bourgeoisie as a ruling class (war is the "continuation of politics"); and a very striking expression of the imperialist character of the war were the secret treaties for the partition of the world and the plunder of other countries, which had been concluded by the ex-tsar with the capitalists of England and France.
The Mensheviks deceived the people in a most despicable manner by calling this war a defensive or revolutionary war; and by approving the policy of the Mensheviks, Kautsky is approving the deception practised on the people, is approving the part played by the petty bourgeoisie in helping capital to trick the workers and to harness them to the chariot of the imperialists.
Kautsky is ad­ vocating a characteristically petty-bourgeois philistine policy by pretending (and trying to make the masses believe the absurd idea} that putting forward a slogan alters the position.
The entire history of bourgeois democracy refutes this illusion; the bourgeois demo· crats have always advanced, and still advance, all sorts of "slogans" in order to deceive the people.
The point is to test their sincerity, to compare their words with their deeds, not to be satisfied with idealistic or charlatan phrases, but to get down to class reality.
An imperialist war does not cease to be an imperialist war when char­ latans or phrasemongers of which is conducting the imperialist war, and which is bound to it by millions of economic threads (and sometimes ropes) , is over­ thrown and is replaced at the helm of state by the really revolution­ ary class, the proletariat.
There is no other way of getting out of an imperialist war, or imperialist predatory peace.
By approving the foreign policy of the Mensheviks, and by declaring it to be internationalist and Zimmerwaldian, Kautsky, :first, confirms the rottenness of the opportunist Zimmerwald major­ ity (it was not without reason that we, the Left Zimmerwaldians, at once dissociated ourselves from it!) and secondly-and this is the most important-passes from the position of the proletariat to that of the petty bourgeoisie, from the revolutionary position to the reformist position.
The prolet&"riat fights for the revolutionary overthrow of the imperialist bourgeoisie; the petty bourgeoisie fights for the reformist "improvement" of imperialism, for adaptation and submission to it.
When Kautsky was still a Marxist, for instance in 1909, when he wrote his Road to Power, he expounded the view that war would inevitably lead to revolution, and he spoke of the ap­ proach of an era of revofotions.
The Basle Manifesto of 1912 direct­ ly and definitely speaks of a proletarian revolution in connection with thai very imperialist war between the German and the British coalitions which actually broke out in 1914.
But in 1918, when these revolutions did begin as a result of the war, Kautsky, instead of pointing out that they were inevitable, instead of pondering over and thinking out to the end the revolutionary tactics and the meth­ ods of prepari~g for revolution, began to describe the reformist tactics of the Mensheviks as internationalism.
Is not this renegacy? Kautsky praises the Mensheviks for maintaining the fighting efficiency of the army, and he blames the Bolsheviks for having increased the state of "disorganisation of the army," which was already disorganised enough.
This means praising reformism and submission to the imperialist bourgeoisie, blaming the revolution and abjuring it; because even under Kerensky the maintenance of the fighting efficiency of the army meant its maintenance under the bourgeois (albeit republican) command.
Everybody knows, and the progress of events has confirmed it, that this republican army preserved the Kornilov spirit because the commanding staff was Kornilovist; the bourgeois officers could not help being Kornilov­ ists; they could not help gravitating towards imperialism and' towards the forcible suppression of the proletariat.
All that the Menshevik tactics amounted to in practice was to leave all the foun­ dations of the imperialist war, all the foundations of the bourgeois dictatorship intact, to repair details and to paint up minor defects ("reforms") .
On the other hand, not a single great revolution has ever re­ frained from "disorganising" the army and cannot now refrain from doing so; because the army is the most rigid instrument for s~1p~or.
ting the old regime, the most hardened bulwark of bourgeoi& d1sc1plme, of the rule of capital, of preserving among the toiling masses and imbuing them with the servile spirit of ~ubmission and subjection to capital.
Counter-revolution has never tolerated, and never could tolerate, the armed workers side by side with the army.
Engels wrote that in France, after each revolution, the workers were armed; "therefore the disarming of the workers was the first com­ mandment of the bourgeois at the helm of the state.
" The armed workers were the embryo of a new army, the nucleus of t:Iie organisation 'of a new social order.
The first commandment of the bourgeoisie was: crush this nucleus, prevent it from growing.
The first commandment of every victorious revolution, as Marx and Engels repeatedly emphasised, was: smash the old army, dissolve it and replace it by a new one.
In rising to power, the new social class never could, and cannot now, attain power or consolidate it except by absolutely disintegrating the old army ("Disorganisa­ tion!" the reactionary or just cowardly philistines will howl) except by passing through a most difficult and painful period with~ out any army (as was the case also during the French Revolution)* and by gradually building up in the midst of stern civil war a new army, a new discipline, a new military organisation of the new class.
Formerly, Kautsky-tlie historian understood this.
The rene­ gade Kautsky has forgotten it.
What right has Kautsky t~ call the Scheidemanns KAUTSKY 175' Socialists" 1 if he approves of the tactics of the Mensheviks in the· Russian revolution? By supporting Kerensky and by joining his.
ministry, the Mensheviks also became government Socialists.
Kaut­ sky will not be able to wriggle out of this conclusion if he attempts to raise the question: which ruling cl ass is waging the imperialist war? But Kautsky avoids raising the question of the ruling class, a question that must be put by a Marxist, because the mere raising of the question would expose him as a renegade.
The Kautskyans in Germany, the Longuetists in France, and the Turatis and Co.
in Italy argue in this way: socialism pre· supposes the equality and freedom of nations, their self-determina­ tion; hence, when our country is attacked, or when enemy troops invade our territory, it is the right and duty of the Socialists to­ defend the country.
But theoretically such an argument is either sheer mockery of socialism or a fraudulent evasion; from the point of view of practical politics, this argument coincides with that of the very ignorant muzhik who has no conception of the social, the class character of the war, and the tasks of a.
revolutionary party during a reactionary war.
Socialism is opposed to violence against nations.
That i& indisputable.
But socialism is opposed to violence against men in general.
Apart from Christian-Anarchists and Tolstoyans,·"-· however, no one has yet drawn the conclus1on from this that social­ ism is opposed to revolutionary violence.
Hence, to talk about "violence" in general, without examining the conditions which distinguish reactionary from revolutionary violence, means being a: petty bourgeois who renounces revolution, or else it means simply deceiving oneself and others by sophistry.
The same holds good about violence against nations.
Every war is the exercise of violence against nations, but that does not prevent Socialists from being in favour of a revolutionary war.
The class character of the war-that is the fundamental question which con­ fronts a Socialist (if he is not a renegade).
The imperialist war of 1914-18 is a war between two coalitions of the imperialist bour­ geoisie for the partition of the world, for the division of the booty, 1 See note to p.
25.
**-Ed.
This was the appraisal of the war given in the Basle Manifesto in 1912, and since then it has been confirmed by facts.
Whoever .
departs from this point of view ceases to be a Socialist.
If a German under Wilhelm, or a Frenchman under Clemenceau .
says: "As a Socialist, I have the right and it is my duty to defend m; country if it is invaded by an enemy," he argues not like a Social­ ist, n?t like an internationalist, not like a revolutionary proletarian, hut like a pettr-bourgeois nationalist.
Because this argument leaves ·Out of account the revolutionary class struggle of the workers ao-ainst ·capital, it leaves out of account the appraisal of the war as a :hole from the point of view of the world bourgeoisie and the world pro­ letariat: that is, it leaves out internationalism, and all that remains is a miserable and narrow-minded nationalism.
My country is being wronged, that is all I care about-this is what this argument reduces itself to, and that is why it is petty-bourgeois nationalist narrow­ mindedness.
It is the same as if in regard to individual violence violence against an individual, one were to argue that socialism i~ -0pposed to violence and therefore I would rather be a traitor than go to prison.
The Frenchman, the German or Italian who says: "Socialism is opposed to violence against nations, ·therefore I defend myself when my country is invaded," betrays socialism and internationalism.
because he onlr thinks of his own "country," he puts "his own'; · · · "bourgeoisie" above everything else and forgets about the international connections which make the war an imperialist war, and make his bourgeoisie a link in the chain of imperialist plunder.
All philistines and all stupid and ignorant yokels ·argue in :exactl_r_the s,~e way as the renegade Kautskyans, Longuetists, and Turati-1sts: The enemy has invaded my country; I do not care .

ontinuation, If the war is a reactionary perialist war, that is, if it is being waged by two world coalitions ·of the imperialist, violent, predatory, reactionary bourgeoisie, then every bourgeoisie (even of the smallest country) becomes a par­ ticipant in the plunder, and my duty as a representative of the revolutionary proletariat is to prepare for the world proletarian revolution as the onlr escape from the horrors of a world war.
I must argue, not from the point of view of 'my' country (for this is the argument of a poor, stupid, nationalist philistine who does not realise that he is only a plaything in the hands of the imperial­ ist bourgeoisie), but from the point of view of mr share in the preparation, in the propaganda, and in the acceleration of the world proletarian revolution.
" This is what· internationalism .
is, and this is the duty of the · internationalist, of the revolutionary worker, of the genuine Social­ ist.
This is the ABC that Kautsky the renegade has "forgotten.
" And his apostasy becomes still more palpable when, after approving of the tactics of the petty-bourgeois nationalists (the Mensheviks in Russia, the Longuetists in France, the Turatis in Italy, and the Haases and Co.
in Germany), he begins to criticise the Bolshevik tactics.
This is what he says: "The Bolshevik revolution was based on the assumption that it would become tbe starting point of a general European revolution, that the bold initiative of .
Russia would rouse the proletarians of all Europe to insurrection.
"On this assumption it was, of course, immaterial what forms the Russian separate peace would assume, what hardships and territorial mutilations ( V erstiimmelungen) it would cause the Russian people, and what inter­ pretation of the self-determination of nations it would give.
It was also im­ material whether Russia was able to defend herself or not.
According to this -0pinion, the European revolution would be the best protection of the Russian practice they continue to support their respective imperialist bourgeoisies.
The difference between the two types is slight.
It is like the difference between two capitalists-one with rude, and the other with sweet words on his lips.
12 I! , I the peoples inhabiting the former Russian territory.
A revolution in Europe, which would' establish and consolidate the socialist order there, would also ' become the means of removing the obstacles to the introduction of the socialist :system of production which existed in, Russia owing to the economic back­ wardness of the country.
All this would be very logical and very sound if the :main assumption were granted, viz.
, that the Russian revolution would neces­ sarily let loose a European revolution.
But what if that did not happen? .
"So far the assumption has not been justified, and the proletariat of Europe is now being accused of having abandoned and betrayed the Russian revolution.
This is an accusation levelled against unknown persons, for who is to be held responsible for the behaviour of the European proletariat?" (p.
28).
And Kautsky then goes on to repeat again and again that Marx, Engels and Bebel were more than once mistaken in their prediction of the advent of anticipated revolutions, but that they never based their tactics on the expectation of a revolution at a "definite date" (p.
29), whereas, he says, the Bolsheviks "staked everything on a general European revolution.
" We have deliberately quoted this long passage in order to show our readers with what "agility" Kautsky counterfeits Marxism by palming off banal and reactionary philistine views in its stead.
First, to ascribe to an opponent an obvious absurdity and then to refute it is a trick that is played by not over-clever people.
If the Bolsheviks had based their tactics on the expectation of a revolution in other countries that was to come on a definite date, they would have been guilty of utter folly.
But the Bolshevik Party has never been guilty of that folly.
In my letter to the American workers of August 20, 1918, I expressly repudiate such folly when I say that we counied on an American revolution, but not at any definite date.
I propounded the very same idea more than once in my controversy with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and "Left Communists" (January-March 1918).
Kautsky has committed a little .
.
.
a very little forgery, and on this he bases his criticism of Bolshevism.
Kautsky has confused tactics which are based on the expectation of a European revolution in the more or less near future, but not on a definite date, with tactics based on the expectation of a Euro­ pean revolution on a definite date.
A little forgery, a very little one! The last-named tactics are foolish.
The first-named are obliga­ tory for all Marxists, for all brought about by the war in all European countries, a:id they alone correspond to the international tasks of the proletariat.
.
By substituting the petty question about an er_ror wh~ch the Bolshevik revolutionaries might have made, but _did not, i~r t~e important question of the foundations of r~volut10nar.
y tactics m general, Kautsky adroitly abjures all revolut10nary tactl~s.
.
A renegade in politics, he is unable to present the quest~on _of the objective prerequisites of revoluti~nary tactics theoretically· And this brings us to the second pomt.
Secondly it is oblirratory for the Marxist to count on a European revolution if a revol::iionary situation exists.
It is an e~ementary axiom of Marxism that the tactics of the socialist prole~anat cannot be the same in a revolutionary situation as when there is no revolu-tionary situation.
.
.
_ If Kautsky had put this question, which is obligatory for ev_ery Marxist, he would have seen that the answer wa~ a~solutely agamst him.
Long before the war, all Marxists, all Social~sts, _were agreed that a European war would create a revolutionary s1tuat10n .
.
Kautsky himself, before he became a renegade, cl~arly an~ defimtel! a~­ mitted this, in 1902 (in his Social Revolution) and m 1909 (m ~is R d to Power).

The political facts also provide an answer to the question: ever since 1915 a splitting process has been observed in all countries among the old and de­ caying Socialist parties, a process of departure of the masses of the proletariat from the social-chauvinist leaders to the Left to revolu­ tionary ideas and sentiments, to revolutionary leaders.

This absunlity h~s · t-~r:fli{& agaiii~i:'k'~u'i~k/!rf~~~if' because the logical conclusion of his argument is as follows: the tactics of the Bolsheviks would have been correct if a European revolution had broken out by August 5, 1918.
This is the very date that Kautsky mentions as the date on which he was writing his pamphlet.
And when, a few ~¥eeks after this August 5, it became clear that a revolution was approaching in a number of European countries, the whole renegacy of Kautsky, his whole falsification of Marxism, and his utter inability to reason in a revolutionary man­ ner, or even to put the question in a revolutionary manner, became revealed in all their charm.
Wnen the proletarians of Europe are accused of treachery, Kautsky writes, it is an accusation against unknown persons.
You are mistaken, Mr.
Kautsky ! Look in the mirror and you will see those "unknown persons" against whom the accusation is levelled.
Kautsky assumes an air of innocence and pretends not to understand who has levelled the accusation, and what meaning it has.
As a matter of fact Kautsky knows perfectly well that the accusation has been and is being levelled by the German "Lefts," by the Spartacists, by Liebknecht and his friends.
The accusation expresses a clear appreciation of the fact that the German proletariat betrayed the Russian (and international) revolution, when it stran­ gled Finland, the Ukraine, Latvia, and Esthonia .
.
,.
This accusation is directed primarily and above all, not against the masses, who are always downtrodden, but against those leaders who, like the Schei· demanns and the Kautskys, failed in their duty to carry on revolu­ tionary agitation, revolutionary propaganda and revolutionary work among the masses to combat their inertness, who in fact worked against the revolutionary instincts and aspirations which are always aglow in the depths of the oppressed classes.
The Scheidemanns openly, crudely, cynically and in the majority of cases for corrupt motives betrayed the proletariat and deserted to the bourgeoisie.
The Kautskyans and the Longuetists did the same thing, only in a hesitating and hal,ting manner, casting cowardly side glances at those who were stronger at the moment.
In all his writings during the war Kautsky tried to extinguish the revolutionary spirit, instead of fostering and fanning it.
--------------theoretical importance, and the still greater agitational and pro· paganda importance, of the "acClJ.
sation" that the proletarians of Europe have betrayecl the Russian revolution will remain a his­ torical monument to the philistine stupidity of the "average" leader of German official Social-Democracy! Kautsky does not understand that, owing to the censorship prevailing in the German "Empire," this "accusation" was perhaps the only form in which the German Socialists who have not betrayed Socialism, Liebknecht and his friends, could express their appeal to the German worlr,ers to throw off the Scheidemanns and the Kautskys, to push aside such "lead­ ers," to emancipate themselves from their stultifying and vulgar propaganda, to rise in revolt in spite of them, without them, and over their heads.
It was the call for revolution! Kautsky does not understand this.
How is he to understand the tactics of the Bolsheviks? Can a man who renounces revolution in general be expected to weigh and appraise the conditions of the dev~~,? ment o ~h.
e-;:e~Blutip_n in one of the most "difficult" cases? ···~' t~~~~~fi:~s~~fere correct; they were the only inter-nationalist tactics, because they were based, not on the cowardly fear of a world revolution, not on a philistine "disbelief" in it, not on the narrow nationalist desire to protect "one's own" fatherland (the fatherland of one's hour eoi · ,,a.

The alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry in general' reveals the bourgeois character of the revolution because the peas· antry in general are small producers who stand on the basis of commodity production.
And the Bolsheviks immediately added:: 185 n~utralise the middle peasantry and, overthrow the bourgeoisie: this will be the socialist revolution, as distinct from the bourgeois­ -democratic revolution (see my pamphlet Two Tactics, published in 1905, and reprinted in Petrograd in 1907 1 in the symposium Twelve Years).
* Kautsky took an indirect part in this controversy in 1905.
In reply to an inquiry by the then Menshevik Plekhanov, he expressed an opinion that was, in fact, opposed to that of Plekhanov, which provoked particular ridicule in the Bolshevik press at the time.
'But now Kautsky does not utter a single word about the controversies ·of that time (for fear of being exposed by his own statements) and thereby deprives the German reader of the opportunity of under­ standing the gist of the matter.
Mr.
Kautsky could not very well tell the German workers in 1918 that in 1905 he had been in favour ··-Of an ~lliance of the workers with the peasants and not with the liberal bourgeoisie, and he could.
not tell them the conditions he had ,, .
adv~cated for this alliance, and the programme he had proposed for It.
Retreating from his old position, Kautsky, on the pretext of making an "economic analysis," and uttering proud words about "historical materialism," now advocates the subordination of the workers to the bourgeoisie, and, with the aid of quotations from the Menshevik Maslov, chews the cud of the old liberal views of the Mensheviks; the quotations are intended to illustrate the brand ilew idea about the backwardness of Russia, but the deduction drawn from this new idea is the old one that in a bourgeois revolution the proletariat must not go further than the bourgeoisie! And this in .
spite of all that Marx and Engels said when comparing the bour­ geois revolution in France in 1789-93 with the bourgeois revolution in Germany in 1848 ! ** Before dealing with the chief "argument" and the main content ,of Kautsky's so-called "economic analysis," we will point out that 1 "The Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution" :Selected Works, Vol.

f "Agriculture, and precisely small peasant production, is to this day the economic foundation of Russia.
Abo1it four-fifths, and perhaps even five-sixths, of the population live by it" (p.
45).
First of all, my dear theoretician, have you thought about how many exploiters there might be among this mass of small producers? Certainly not more than one-tenth of the total, and in the towns still less, because large-scale production is more highly developed there.
Take even an incredibly high fi.
gilre; assume that· one-fifth of the small producers are exploiters who lose the franchise.
Even then you will see that the 66 per cent of the Bolsheviks at the Fifth Con­ gress of Soviets represented the majority of the population.
To this it must be added that there has always been a considerable section 'of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries which was in favour of the Soviet government-in principle all the ·Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were in favour of the Soviet government, and when a section of them, in July 1918, raised the adventurist insurrection, two new parties split away from them, viz.
, the so-called "Narodnik-CommunistE" and the "Revolutionary Communists"* (consisting of prominent Left Socialist-Revolutionaries who had been nominated for important posts in the government by the old party; for instance, Zacks · belonged to the first-mentioned new party, and Kolegayev to the second).
Hence, Kautsky has himself-unwittingly-refuted the ri­ diculous fable that the Bolsheviks only had the support of a minority of the population.
Secondly, my dear theoretician, have you thought about the fact that the small peasant producer inevitably oscillates between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie? Kautsky very conveniently "forgot" this Marxian truth, which has been confirmed by the whole of the modern history of Europe, because it shatters the Menshevik "theory" that he repeats! Had Kautsky not "forgotten" this he could not have denied that a proletarian dictatorship was needed in a country in which the small peasant producer is predominant Let us examine the main content of our theoretician's "economic analysis.
" That the Soviet regime is a dictatorship cannot be disputed, says Kautsky.
"But is it the dictatorship of the ')Jroletariat?" (p.
34).
"Accor~ing to .
the ?oviet.
constitutio)l the peasants form the majority of the l'.
opulat10n :which is entitled to participate in legislation and admin-1stra~10n.
~hat is prese~ted to us as a dictatorship of the proletariat would be-1£ ?arned out _consistently, and if, generally speaking, a single class could directly exercise a dictatorship, which in reality can only be exercised by a party-a dictatorship of the peasantry" (p.
35).
And, elated over this.
profound and clever argument, good Kaut-.
sky tries to be witty and says: -.
'.
'It would appear, therefore, that the most painless realisation of social-ism IS best secured when it is put in the hands of the peasants" (p.
35).
.
.
Arguing in great detail, and citing extremely learned quotations irom the semi-liberal Maslov, our theoret1cian advances a new idea -that the peasants are interested in high grain prices, in low wages for the urban workers, etc.
, etc.
Incidentally, the less attention our author p~ys to the really new phenomena of the post-war period­ such as, rnr example, that the peasants demand for their grain, not ~1oney, but goo_ds, and that they lack the necessary agricultural nnplements, which cannot be obtained in sufficient quantities for any ~mount of money-the more tedious the enunciation of these new ideas becomes.
But of this more anon.
.
Thus,.
Kauts~y charges the Bolsheviks, the party of the prole­ tariat, with havmg surrendered the dictatorship, surrendered the work of realising socialism, to the petty-bourgeois peasantry.
Ex­ cellent,_ Mr.
Kautsky ! But what, in your enlightened opinion, should the attitude of the proletarian party towards the petty-bourgeois peasantry have been? .
?ur theoreti?ian, evidently bearing in mind the proverb: "Speech 1~ silver, but silence is golden," prefers to remain silent.
But he gives himself away by the following argument: .
""Originally, the pea~ants' Sovi~ts were organisations of the peasantry ~n '?eneral.
Now the Soviet Republic proclaims that the Soviets are organ-1sat10ns .
of the proletarians and the poor peasants.
The well-to-do peasants bre ~epnved of representation in the Soviets.
The poor peasant is declared to 'cl~ t e pehr~anent and mass product of the socialist agrarian reform under the ictawrs 1p of the proletariat'" is the kind of irony that is heard in Russia from the lips of every bourgeois: they all jeer and gloat over the fact that the Soviet Republic openly admits the existence of poor peasants.
They jeer at socialism.
They have a right to do that.
But a "Socialist" who laughs at the idea that after four years of a most ruinous war there should be (and will be for a long time) poor peasants in Russia-such a Socialist could only have been born at a time of wholesale renegacy.
Listen further : "The Soviet Republic interferes in the relations between the rich and poor peasants, but not by redistributing the land.
In order to relieve the bread shortage in the towns, detachments of armed workers were sent into the villages to confiscate the rich peasants' surplus stocks.
Part of that stock was distributed among the urban population, the other part was distributed among the poorest peasants" (p.
48).
Of course, Kautsky, the ·Socialist and Marxist, is profoundly indignant at the idea that such a measure should be extended beyonc the environs of large towns (as a matter of fact it is practised all over our country).
With the matchless, incomparable and admirable coolness (or pig-headedness) of a philistine, Kautsky, the Socialist and Marxist, says didactically: "It" (the expropriation of the well-to-do peasants) "introduces a new element of unrest and civil war into the process of production" (civil war in­ troduced into the "process of production"-this is something supernatural!) "which urgently needs order and security for its recovery" (p.
49) .
Oh, yes, of course, it is quite proper for Kautsky, the Marxist and Socialist, to sigh and shed tears for order and security for the exploiters and grain profiteers who hoard their surplus stocks of grain, sabotage the grain monopoly law, and reduce the urban population to famine.
"We are all Socialists and Marxists and Inter­ nationalists," sing the Kautskys, the Heinrich Webers (Vienna), the Longuets (Paris), the MacDonalds (London), etc.
, in chorus; "we are all in favour of a working class revolution, only .
.
.
only we would like a revolution that does not disturb the order and security of the grain profiteers.
" Yes, and we camouflage this dirty sub­ serviency to the capitalists by a "Marxist" reference to the "process of production.
" If this is Marxism, what is being a flunkey of· the bourgeoisie? as the dictatorship of the proletariat, hut at the same time he accuses us of introducing civil war into the r'ural districts (which we think is to our credit), of despatching armed detachments of workers to the villages, who publicly proclaim that they are exercising the "dicta­ torship of the proletariat and of the poorest peasantry,'' assist the latter and confiscate from the profiteers, from the rich peasants, the surplus stocks of grain which they are hoarding in contravention of the grain monopoly law! On the one hand, our Marxist theoretician stands for pure democracy,.
for the subordination of the revolutionary class, the leader of all the toilers and the exploited, to the majority of the population (including, therefore, the exploiters).
On the other hand, as an argument against us, he explains that the revolution must inevitably bear a bourgeois character-bourgeois, because the peasantry as a whole stands pn the basis of bourgeois social rela­ tions-and yet he pretends to defend the proletarian, the class, the Marxian point of view! Instead of an "economic analysis" we have a first-class hodge· podge and muddle.
Instead of Marxism we have fragments of liberal doctrines and the preaching of servility to the bourgeoisie and the kulaks.

.
Things have turned out just as we said they would.
The course taken by the revolution has confirmed the correctness of our reason­ ing.
First, with the "whole" of the peasantry against the monarchy,.
the landlords, the medireval regime (and to that extent, the revolu­ tion re.
.
.
'Uains bourgeois, bourgeois-democratic).
Then, with the poor­ est peasants, with the semi-proletarians, with all the exploited, against capitalism, including the rural rich, the kulaks, the profit­ eers, and to that extent the revolution becomes a socialist one.
To.
attempt to raise an artificial Chinese wall between the first and second revolutions, to separate them by anything else than the degree of preparedness of the proletariat and the degree .
of unity with the poor peasants, is monstrously to distort Marxism, to vulgar-· ise it, to put liberalism in its place.
It means smuggling in a reaction­ ary defence of the bourgeoisie against the socialist proletariat by means of quasi-scientific references to the progressive character of the bourgeoisie as compared with medirevalism.
Incidentally, it is just because the Soviets, by uniting and draw­ ing the masses of workers and peasants into political life, are the most sensitive barometer, closest to the "people" (in the sense in.
which Marx, in 1871, spoke of a real people's revolution*), of the growth and d('lvelopment of the political, class maturity of the masses, that they represent an immeasurably higher form and type of democracy.
The Soviet constitution was not drawn up according to some "plan"; it was not drawn up in a study, and was not thrust upon the toilers by bourgeois lawyers.
No, this constitution emerged in the course of the development of the class struggle in proportion as class antagonisms matured.
The very facts which Kautsky himself had to admit prove this.
At first, the Soviets united the peasantry as a whole.
Owing to.
the immaturity, the backwardness, the ignorance of the poorest peas­ ants, the leadership passed into the hands of the kulaks, of the rich, of the capitalists, of the petty bourgeoisie and of the petty-bourgeois intellectuals.
That was the period of the domination of the petty bourgeoisie, of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries (only The petty bourgeoisie inevitably vacillated between the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (Kerensky, Kornilov, Savinkov) and the dictator­ ship of the proleta,riat; because,owing to the very nature of its economic position, the petty bourgeoisie is incapable of doing any­ thing independently.
Incidentally, Kautsky completely renounces Marxism by making shift, in his analysis of the Russian revolution, with the legal and formalist concept of "democracy," which serves :the bourgeoisie as a screen to conceal its domination over the masses, and as a means of deceiving them, and by for getting ithat in practice "democracy" sometimes means the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie ,and sometimes the impotent reformism of the petty bourgeoisie which submits to that diotatorship, and so on.
According to Kautsky, in a capitalist country there were bourgeois parties, and there was a proletarian party which led the majority, the mass of the prole­ tariat (the Bolsheviks), but there were no petty-bourgeois parties! 'The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had no class roots, no petty-bourgeois roots! The vacillations of the petty bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, enlightened the masses and repelled the overwhelming majority of them, all the "rank and file," the proletarians and semi-proletarians, from such "leaders.
" The Bolsheviks secured predominance in the Soviets (in Petro­ grad and Moscow in October 1917) ; the split among the Socialist­ Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks became more pronounced.
The victorious Bolshevik revolution marked the end of vacilla­ tion, it meant the complete destruction of the monarchy and of landlordism (which had not, been d_~§troy~cl.

The Soviets united the peasantry in general.
The class divisions among the peasantry had not yet matured, had not yet come to the surface.
That process took place in the summer and autumn of 1918.
The Czecho-Slovak counter-revolutionary mutiny roused the kulaks.
A wave of kulak insurrections swept over Russia.
The poorest peasantry learned, not from books or newspapers, but from life, kulaks, of the rich, of the rural bourgeoisie.
Like every other petty­ bourgeois party, the "Left Socialist-Revolutionaries" reflected the vacillation of the masses, and precisely in the summer of 1918 a split occurred among them: one section joined the Czecho-Slovaks (insurrection in Moscow, when Proshyan, having seized the tele­ graph office-for one hour-informed Russia of the overthrow of the Bolsheviks; then the treachery of Muravyev, Commander-in· Chief of the army that was fighting against the Czecho-Slovaks, etc.
*), while another section, that mentioned above, remained with the Bolsheviks.
The intensification of the food shortage in the towns caused the question of the grain monopoly to become more urgent (in his economic analysis, which is a mere repetition of platitudes gleaned from Maslov's writings of ten years ago, Kautsky the theoretician quite "forgot" about this monopoly!).
The old landlord and bourgeois and even the democratic· republican state had sent armed detachments to the rural districts and these detachments were practically at the disposal of the bour­ geoisie.
Mr.
l(autsky, of course, does not know this! He does not regard this as the "dictatorship of the.
bourgeoisie.
" God forbid! It is "pure democracy," especially if it has been confirmed by a bourgeois parliament! Noi-has Kautsky "heard" that, in the summer and autumn of 1917, Avksentyev and S.
Maslov, in company with Kerensky, Tseretelli and other Socialist-Revolutionaries and Men­ sheviks, arrested the members of the Land Committees;** he does not say a word about that! The whole point is that a bourgeois state, which is exercising the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie through a democratic "republic, cannot confess to the people that it is serving the bourgeoisie; it cannot tell the truth, and is compelled to be hypocritical.
.
But a state of the Paris Commune type, a Soviet state, openly tells the people the truth and declares that it is the dictatorship of the proletariat and of the poorest peasantry; and by this truth it rallies to its side scores and scores of millions of new citizens who are kept down under any democratic republic, but who are drawn by the Soviets into political life, into democracy, into the administra· 13 detachments of armed workers (primarily the most advanced) from the capitals.
· These workers carry socialism into-the countryside,.
ral1y the poor to their side, organise and enlighten them, and help them to suppress the resistance of the bourgeoisie.
All those who are familiar with the conditions in the rural dis­ tricts, who have been in the rural districts, declare that it was not until the summer and autumn of 1918 that the rural districts passed through the "October" (i.
e.
, proletarian) "revolution.
" A turning point was reached.
The wave of kulak insurrections gave way -to the rising of the poor, to the growth of the "Committees of Poor Peasants.
"* In the army, the number of working class commissars, working class officers and working class commanders of divisions and armies increased.
And at the very time that Kautsky, frightened by the July (1918) crisis and the lamentations of the bourgeoisie, was running after the latter -like a.
"cockerel," and was writing a pamphlet that' breathe<l the conviction-that the Bolsheviks were on the eve of· being-ove'rthrown by the peasantry; at the very.
time that this simpleton regarded the desertion 0f.
the Left Socialist-Revolu­ tionaries as the "contraction" (p.
37) of the circle of.
those who supported the Bolsheviks-at that very time-the real circle of sup­ porters of Bolshevism was exPanding enormously, because millions a:nd millions of the village poor were freeing-themselves from the tutelage and influence of the kulaks and the village bourgeoisie and were awakening to independent• political life.
We-have lost hundreds of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, spine­ less peasant intellectuals and kulaks; but we have gained millions of representative$c of the poor.

The peasantry would then have remamed an "integral whole," i.

, it would have remained under the econ­ omic, political, and moral leadership of the kulaks, of the rich, of the bourgeoisie, and the revolution would not have passed beyo~d the limits of a bourgeois-democratic revolution.
(It must be said in parenthesis that even this would not have meant that the prole­ tariat should not have assumed power, for the proletariat alone has really carried the bourgeois-democratic revoluti_on to its lo~ical con­ clusion, the proletariat alone has done somethmg really import~nt to bring nearer the world proletarian revolution, the proletariat alone has created the Soviet state, which, after the Paris Commune, is the second step in the direction of the socialist state.

in the rural districts without being able to prepare for it and brmg it about, had ' .

" f at once attempted to "decree" a civil war or t e mtro ~ct10n o socialism in the rural districts, had attempted to do without the temporary bloc (alliance) with the peasants in general, without making a number of concessions to the middle peasants, e:c.
, that attempt would have been a Blanquist distortion of Mar~1s~, a~ attempt of the minority to impose its will upon the maionty; it would have been a theoretical absurdity, it would have revealed a failure to understand that a general peasant revolution is ·still a bourgeois revolution, and that without a series of .
tr~nsitions, t;an~i­ tional stages; it cannot be transformed into a socialist revolut10n m a backward country.
Kautsky has confused everything in this very important theo-retical and political problem, and has, in practice, proved to be a 13* ----------of the proletariat .
.
* * * Kautsky has introduced similar if not greater confusion into another very interesting and important question; namely: Was the legislative activity of the Soviet Republic in the field of agrarian reformation-a most difficult and yet most.
important socialist reformation-based on sound principles and properly carried out? We should be grateful beyond words to every West-European Marx­ ist who, after studying at least the most important documents, would criticise our policy, because he would thereby he rendering us im­ mense assistance and would also help the maturing revolution throughout the world.
But instead of criticism Kautsky produces incredible theoretical confusion which convertl5 Marxism into liber­ alism, and which,_ in practice, is a series of idle, angry, vulgar sallies against the Bolsheviks.
Let the reader judge for himself.
"Large landownership was made untenable by the.
revolution.
That be­ came clear immediately.
The transference of the large estates to the peasant population became inevitable.
" (This is not true, Mr.
Kautsky.
You substitute what is "clear'; to you for the attitude of the different classes towards the question.
The history of the revolution has shown that the coalition govern­ ment of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, pursued a policy of preserving large landownership.
This was proved particularly by S.
Maslov's law and by the arrest of the members of the Land Committees.
Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, the "peasant population" would not have defeated the landlords, who were allied with the capitalists.
) " .
•.
On the question as to the forms in which this was to be carried out, however, there was no unity.
Several solutions were conceivable •.
.
.
" (Kautsky is most of all concerned about "unity" among "So· cialists," no matter who called themselves by that name.
He forgets that the principal classes in capitalist society are bound to arrive ·have been to transform the large estates into state property and to allow -the peasants who hitherto had been empl?yed o? ~hem as wage labour~rs to cultivate them in the form of co-operatlve soc1et1es.
But such a solution presupposes the existence of a type of agricultural labourer that.
does not exist in Russia.
Another solution would have been -to transform the large estates into state property and to divide them up into small plots, to .
be ·rented out to peasants who owned little land.
Had that been done, somethmg socialistic would have been achieved .
•.
• " As usual, Kautsky makes shift with the celebrated on~the-o~e­ hand on-the-other-hand.
He places different solutions side by side without asking himself the question-the only realistic and Marxian question: what stages must he passed from capitalism to communism in such and such special conditions? There are agricultural labour­ ers in Russia, although not many, but Kautsky did not touch the question which the Soviet government di~ raise as to the met~10d of transition to a communal and co-operativ~ form of land cultiva­ tion.
The most curious thing, however, is that Kautsky sees "some­ thing socialistic" in the renting out of small plots of land.
In reality, this is a petty-bourgeois slogan, and there is nothing "socialistic" -about it at all.
If the "state" that rents out the land is not a state of the Paris Commune type, if it is a parliamentary bourgeois republic (and such is Kautsky's constant assumption) the renting out of the land in plots is a typical liberal reform.
Kautsky ignores the fact that the Soviet regime has abolished all private property in land.
Worse than that: he resorts to an in­ credible subterfuge.
He quotes the decrees of the Soviet government in such a way as to omit the most important part.
After stating that "small production strives for complete private property in the means of production," and that the Constituent Assembly would have been the "only authority'' capable of prevent­ ing the dividing up of the land (an assertion which will cause laughter throughout Russia, where everybody knows that the Soviets alone are recognised as authoritative institutions by the workers and peasants, while the Constituent Assembly has become the slogan of the Czecho-Slovaks and the landlords), Kautsky con!inues: °'One of the first decrees of the Soviet government declared that 1) all landlords' property in land is abolished immediately without compensation; 2) all landlords' estates, as well as all appanage, monastery· and church andf t e yezd 2 Soviets of Pe t , D .

* Article 2, paragraph l of this Declaration states that "private property in land is hereby abolished," and that "model estates and agricultµral enterprises are proelaimed national property.
" Hence, the reference to the Constituent Assembly did not remain a dead letter, because another national representative body, im­ measurably more authoritative in the eyes of the peasants, undertook the solution of the agrarian problem.
Again, on February 19 [6], 1918, the Land Socialisation Act was promulgated, which once again confirmed the abolition of all private property in land and placed the land and all private stock at the disposal of the Soviet authorities under the control of the federal Soviet government.
Among the duties of the Soviet author­ ities in connection with the disposal of the land, the law prescribed: "The development of collective farming as the more advantageous iii respect of economy of labour and produce, in preference to individual farming, with a view to the transition to socialist agricultural economy'? (article 11, paragraph d).
The same law, in establishing the principle of equal land tenure, replied to the fundamental question: "Who has a right to the use of the land?" in the following manner: "Article 20.
Plots of land surface for public and private needs.
within the frontiers of the Russian Soviet Federative Republic may be used: A.

For agricultural purposes: 3) by agricultural communes, 4) by agricultural co-operative associations, 5) by village communities, 6) by private families and persons .

" The reader will perceive that Kautsky has completely distorted the facts, and has given the German reader an absolutely false view of the agrarian policy and of the agrarian legislation of the prole-tarian state in Russia.
Kautsky was not even able to formulate the theoretically im-portant fundamental questions.

rs an t e 01 mg and the theoretical significance of the question! Kautsky will never be able to refute the view that equal land tenure has a progressive and revolutionary significance in the hour· geois-democratic revolution.
Such a revolution cannot go beyond this.
On reaching this limit, it clearly, quickly and easily reveals to the masses the inadequacy of bourgeois-democratic solutions and the necessity of proceeding beyond their limits, of passing on to socialism.
Having overthrown tsarism and landlordism, the peasantry dreamed of equal land tenure, and no power on earth could have .
prevented the peasantry, who had been freed from landlordism and from the bourgeois parliamentary republican state, from realising this dream.
The proletarians said to the peasants: We shall help you to reach "ideal" capitalism, for equal land tenure is the ideal­ isation of capitalism from the point of view of the small producer.
At the same time we will prove to you its inadequacy and the neces­ sity of passing to the social cultivation of the land.
It would have been interesting to see Kautsky attempt to prove that this leadership of the peasant struggle by the proletariat was wrong.
But Kautsky preferred to evade this question altogether.
Moreover, Kautsky deliberately deceived his German readers by withholding from them the fact that in its Land Law.
the Soviet government gave direct preference to communes and co-operative associations by putting them in the forefront.
With the peasantry to the end of the bourgeois-democratic rev­ olution; and with the poorest, the proletarian and semi-proletarian section of the peasantry, forward to the socialist revolutfon! Such has been the policy of the Bolsheviks, and such is the only Marxian policy.
But Kautsky is all muddled up and cannot formulate a single question! On the one hand, he dare not say that the proletarians should have parted company with the peasantry on the question of equal land tenure because he realises that such a rupture would have ·been absurd (and, moreover, in 1905~ when he was not yet a renegade, he explicitly advocated an alliance between the work-On the other hand, he sympathetically quotes the liberal platitudes of l.
lie Menshevik Maslov, who "proves" that petty-bourgeois equal land tenure is utopian and reactionary from the point of view of socialism, but fails to point out the progressive and revolutionary character of the petty-bourgeois struggle for equality and equal tenure from the point of view of a bourgeois-democratic revolution.
Kautsky is in a hopeless muddle: note that he (in 1918) insists on the bourgeois character of the Russian revolution.
He (in 1918) says peremptorily: don't go beyond these limits! And yet this very same Kautsky sees "something socialistic" (for a bourgeois revolu­ tion) in.
the petty-bourgeois reform of renting out small plots of land to the poor peasants (i.
e", the approximation to equal land tenure)! Let those understand this who can! In addition to all this, Kautsky displays a philistine inability to take into account the real policy of a definite political party.
He quotes the phrases of the Menshevik Maslov and refuses to see the real policy the Menshevik Party pursued in 1917, when in "coali­ tion" with landlords and Cadets they actually advocated liberal agrarian reform and compromise with the landlords.
(Proof? The arrest of members of the Land Committees and S.
Maslov's Land Bill.
) Kautsky failed to realise that P.
Maslov's phrases about the re­ actionary and utopfan character of petty-bourgeois equality are really a screen to conceal the Menshevik policy of compromise between the peasants and the landlords (i.
e.
, of helping the land­ lords to deceive the peasants), instead of the revolutionary over­ throw of the landlords by the peasants.
What a Marxist Kautsky is! It was the Bolsheviks who strictly took into account the differ­ ence between the bourgeois-democratic revolution and the socialist revolution: by carrying the first to its end, they opened the door for passing to the second.
This was the only policy that was revolu­ tionary and Marxian.
It is useless for Kauts~y to repeat the old liberal 50).
How smart! But never before have the small peasants of a large country been under the influence of a proletarian state! , ·.
Never before'have the small peasants engaged in an open class struggle extending into civil war between the poorest peasants a~d rich peasants, with the proletarian state giving propagandist, poht­ .
ical, economic and military support to the poor.
Never before have the profiteers and the rich amassed such wealth out of war, while the masses of the peasantry have been so utterly ruined.
Kautsky simply reiterates what is old; chews the old cud, and is afraid to ponder over the new tasks of the proletarian dictatorship.
But what, dear Kautsky, if the peasants lack implements for small production, and the proletarian state helps them.
to obtain agricultural machinery for the collective cultivation of the soil­ is that a "theoretical conviction"? We will now pass to the question of the nationalisation of the land.
Our N arodniki, including all the Left Socialist-Revolution­ aries, deny that the measure we have adopted .
is the nationalisati~n of the land.
They are wrong in theory.
In so far as we remam within the framework of commodity production and capitalism, the abolition of private property in la:p.
d is the nationalisation of the land.
.
.
The term "socialisation" merely expresses a trend, a desire, the preparation for the transition to social~sm.
.
.
.
.
What should he the attitude of Marxists towards the nationalisa-tion of the land? Here, too, Kautsky is unable even to formulate the theoretical question, or, what is worse, he deliberately evades it; although one knows from Russian literature that Kautsky is aware of the old controversies among Russian Marxists on the question of national­ isation or municipalisation (i.
e.
, the transfer of the large estates to the local authorities) , or division of the land.
Kautsky's assertion that transferring the large estates to the state and renting them out in small plots to poor peasants would have achieved "something socialistic" is simply a mockery of Marxism.
We have said already that there was nothing socialistic about it.
But this is not all; it would not even carry the bourgeois-democratic revolution to its logical end.
Kautsky's great misfortune is that he placed his trust in the Mensheviks.
Hence the curious position that while insisting on the bourgeois character of our revolution and reproaching the Bol­ sheviks for taking it into their heads to proceed to socialism, he himself proposes a liberal reform in the guise of socialism, without carrying this reform to the point of clearing away all the survivals of medirevalism in agrarian relationships! The arguments of Kaut­ sky and of his Menshevik advisers amount to a defence of the liberal bourgeoisie who fear revolution, instead of a defence of consistent bourgeois-democratic revolution.
Indeed, why should only the large estates, and not all the land, he transformed into state property? The liberal bourgeoisie would thereby attain the maximum preservation of the old conditions (i.
e.
, the least consistency in revolution), and the maximum facility for returning to the old conditions.
The radical bourgeoisie, i.
e.
; the bourgeoisie that carries the bourgeois revolution to lhe end, demands the nationalisation of the land.
Kautsky, who in the dim and distant past, some twenty years ago, wrote an excellent Marxian work on the agrarian question, cannot hut know Marx's references to the fact that land national­ isation is precisely a consistent slogan of the bourgeoisie.
Kautsky cannot hut he aware of the controversy between Marx and Rod­ bertus, and Marx's remarkable passages in his Theories of Surplus Value,* in which the revolutionary significance--in the bourgeois­ democratic sense-of land nationalisation is explained with par­ ticular clarity.
The Menshevik P.
Maslov, whom, unfortunately for himself, Kautsky chose as an adviser, denied that.
the Russian peasants would agree to the nationalisation of all the land (including the ·peasants' lands).
To a certain extent, this view of Maslov's could be connected with his "origi~al" of the "diminishing fertility of the soil.
" In point of fact, however, even the Revolution of 1905 revealed that the overwhelming majority of the peasants in Russia, members of village communities as well as individual peasant proprietors, were in favour of the nationalisation of all the land.
The Revolution of 1917 confirmed this, and after the assumption of power by the proletariat this was done.
The Bolsheviks remained loyal to Marx­ ism and never tried (in spite of Kautsky, who, without a shadow of evidence, accuses us of doing so) to "skip" the bourgeois-democ~atic revolution.
The Bolsheviks, first of all, helped the most radical, most revolutionary of the bourgeois-democratic ideologists of the peasantry, those who stood closest to the proletariat, namel~, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, to carry out what was practically the nationalisation of the land.
On November 8 [October 26], 1917, i.
e.
, on the very first day of the proletarian socialist revolution, private ownership of land was abolished in Russia.
.
This laid the foundation, the most perfect from the pomt of view of the development of capitalism (Kautsky cannot deny this without breaking with Marx), and at the same time created an agrarian system which is most flexible· from.
the point ?£ vi~w of the transition to socialism.
From the bourgeo1s-democrat1c pomt of view, the revolutionary peasantry could not go any further in Rus­ sia: there can be nothing more "ideal" from this point of view, nothing more "radical" (from this same point of view) than the nationalisation of the land and equal land tenure.
It was the Bol­ sheviks, and the Bolsheviks alone, who, thanks to the victory of the proletarian revolution, helped the peasantry to carry the bour­ geois-democratic revolution really to its end.
And this was the only way in which they could do the utmost to facilitate and accelerate the transition to the socialist revolution.
One can judge from this what an incredible muddle Kautsky offers to his readers by accusing the Bolsheviks of failing to under­ stand the bourgeois character of the revolution, and by himself betraying such a wide departure from Marxism that he says nothing.
about the nationalisation of the land and proposes the least revolu-tionary (even from the bourgeois point of view) liberal agrarian reform as "something socialistic"! We have now come to the third question formulated above, name­ ly, to what extent the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia has taken into account the necessity of passing to the social cultivation of the soil.
Here again, Kautsky commits something in the nature of a forgery: he quotes only the "theses" of one Bolshevik * which speak of the task of passing to the collective cultivation of the soil.
After quoting one of these theses, our "theoretician" triumphantly exclaims: "Unfortunately, a task is not fulfilled by the fact that it is called a task.
For the time being, collective farming in Russia is doomed to remain on paper· only.
The small peasants have never passed to collective production under the influence of theoretical convictfons" (p.
50).
Never has a literary swindle been perpetrated equal to that to which Kautsky has stooped.
He quotes the "theses," but says nothing about the law passed by the Soviet government.
He.
talks about "theoretical convictions," but says nothing about the proletarian state which holds in its hands the factories and goods! All that Kautsky, the Marxist, wrote in 1899 in his Agrarian Question.
about the means at the disposal of the proletarian state for bringing about the gradual transition of the small peasants to socialism has been forgotten by the renegade Kautsky in 1918.
Of course, a few hundred state-supported agricultural communes and Soviet farms (i.
e.
, large estates cultivated by associations of workers on behalf of the state) are very little; but can Kautsky's ignoring of this fact he called "criticism"? The nationalisation of the land that was carried out in Russia by the proletarian dictatorship provided the highest guarantees for carrying the bourgeois-democratic revolution to its end, even in the event of a victory of the counter-revolution causing a reversion from land nationalisation to land division (I examined this pos­ sibility in a pamphlet on the agrarian programme of the Marxists in the 1905 Revolution**).
In addition, the nationalisation of the land has given the proletarian state the maximum opportunity for passing to socialism in agriculture.
podge which is a complete renunciation of.
~arxisn;i, and wi~ a practical policy-of servility,te-the bourgeo1s1e and its reformism.
A fine critique indeed! * * * Kautsky begins his "economic analysis" of industry with the following magnificent argument: Russia has a large-scale capitalist industry; Cannot a.
socialist system of production he built up on this foundation? "One would have thought so if socialism meant that the woi;kers of the various factories and mines appropriated these for themselves m order to carry on production at each facto1y separately .
• ·,; This very day,.
August 5, as I am writing these lines," Kautsky adds, Moscow reports a speech delivered by Lenin on August 2, in which he is stated to have declared: 'T~e workers are holding the factories firmly in their hands, and the.
peasant~ will not restore the land to the landlords.
' Hitherto, the slogan: The factor~es _to the workers, and the land to the peasants-has been an Anarcho-Synd1cahst slogan and not a Soci;tl-Deinocratic slogan" (pp.
52-53) · I have quoted this passage in full in order that the Russian -workers, who formerly quite rightly respected Kautsky, may see for themselves the methods employed by a deserter to the bourgeois camp.
· · .
i Just think: on August 5, when numerous decrees on the nation­ alisation of factories in Russia had been· issued-not a single fac­ tory had been "appropriated by the workers"; all were converted into the property of the republic-on August 5, Kautsky, on t~e strength of an obviously dishonest interpretation of a sentence m my speech, tries to make the German readers believe that in Russia_ the factories were handed over to individual workers! And after that Kautsky, at great length, chews the cud about its being wrong to hand over the factories to individual workers! · This is not cl'iticism, it is the trick of a lackey of the bourgeoisie,· whom the capitalists hire to libel the workers' revolution.
.
· The factories must be handed over to the state, or fo the muni­ cipalities, or .
the co-operative societies, says Kautsky over and over again, and finally he adds: "This is what they are no"IV trying to do in Russia.
.
• .
" or Axelrod, or any of the other friends of the Hussian bqurgeoisie,_ to translate at least one of the decrees on the factories? -"What will come of this we cannot yet tell.
At all events, this aspect of the activity of the Soviet Republic is of the greatest interest for us, but it still remains -entirely shrouded -in darkness.
There is no lack of decrees .
.
.
" (this is why Kautsky ignores their contents, or conceals them from his readers!) "but there is no reliable information as to the effect of these decrees.
Socialist production is impossible without all-rourid, detailed, reliable and rapidly informing statistics.
The Soviet Republic cannot possibly have created such statistics yet.
What we learn about its economic activities is highly contradfotory and cannot be verified.
This, too, is a result of the dictatorship and the suppression of democracy.
There is no freedom of the press, or of speech" (p.
53).
This is how history is written! Had there been "freedom" of the press for the capitalists and Dutovs,1 Kautsky would have re­ ceived information about the factories being handed over to the workers.
This above-class, "serious savant" is really magnificent! Kautsky refuses to touch a single one of the countless facts which show that the factories are being handed over to the republic only, and that they are managed by the Supreme Council of National Economy, an organ of the Soviet government, which is constituted mainly of workers elected by the trade unions.
With the obstinacy of the "man in the muffier," 2 he goes on repeating one thing: give me peaceful democracy, without civil war, without a dictatorship, with good statistics (the Soviet Republic has created a statistical organ­ isation in which the best statistical authorities in Russia are em­ ployed, but, of course, an ideal system of statistics cannot be created so quickly); in a word, give me a revolution without revolution, without fierce struggle, without violence! This is what Kautsky wants.
It is the same as asking for strikes without the workers and employers displaying furious passion.
What is the difference be­ tween this Socialist and a common or garden liberal bureaucrat? And so, relying upon such "factual material," i.
e.
, deliberately and contemptuously ignoring innumerable facts, Kautsky concludes: 1 See note to p.

A gem, is it not? We would advise Kautsky's admirers to circulate this utterance as widely as possible among the Russian workers, because Kautsky could not have provided better material for gauging his political degradation.
Comrades and workers, Ker­ ensky was also a "Socialist," but of a "different colour"! Kautsky, the historian, is satisfied with the title which the Right Socialist­ Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks "appropriated" to themselves.
Kautsky, the historian, refuses even to listen to the facts which loudly proclaim that under Kerensky the Mensheviks and the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries supported the imperialist policy and marauding practices of the bourgeoisie; he is discreetly silent about the fact that the majority in the Constituent Assembly consisted of these "heroes" of the imperialist war and bourgeois dictatorship.
And this is called an "economic analysis"! In conclusion; let me quote another sample of this "economic analysis": "After an existence of nine months, the Soviet Republic, instead of spreading general well-being, has been obliged to explain why there is general distress" (p.
-41).
We are accustomed to hear such arguments from the lips of the Cadets.
All the flunkeys of the bourgeoisie in Russia argue in this way.
They all want to see general well-being brought about in nine months after four years' ruinous war and in the midst of sabotage and numerous insurrections of the bourgeoisie, aided and abetted by foreign capital! In actual practice, there is absolutely no differ­ ence whatever, not a shade of difference between Kautsky and the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie.
His sentimental speeches cloaked in the guise of "socialism" only repeat what the Kornilovs, the Dutovs and the Krasnovs in Russia say bluntly, straightforwardly and without embellishments.
* The above lines were written on November 9, 1918.
Late on the same night news was received from Germany announcing the be-14 ginning of a victorious revolution, at first at Kiel and other northern towns and ports, where power has passed into the hands of Councils of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, and then in Berlin, where power has also passed into the hands of the Council.
* The conclusion which I intended to write on Kautsky's pamphlet and on the proletarian revolution is now superfluous.
November 10, 1918 APPENDIX II 1 ·~ ·, V ANDERVELDE's NEW BooK oN THE STATE IT was not until I had finished reading Kautsky's book that Vander­ velde's book, Socialism Versus the State (Paris, 1918), came into my hands.
A comparison of the two books involuntarily suggests itself.
Kautsky is the ideological leader of the Second International (1889-1914), while Vandervelde, in his capacity of President of the International Socialist Bureau, is its official representative.
Both represent the complete bankruptcy of the Second International, and both with the skill of experienced journalists "cleverly" conceal this bankruptcy and their own bankruptcy and desertion to-the bour­ geoisie with Marxian catchwords.
One gives us a striking example of German opportunism, ponderous, academic, grossly falsifying Marxism by trimming it of all that is unacceptable to the bour­ geoisie.
The other is typical of the Latin-to a certain extent, one may say, West European (that is, west of Germany)-species of prevailing opportunism, which is more flexible, less ponderous, and which falsifies Marxism by a similar method, but in a more subtle manner.
Both radically distort Marx's tenets on the state and on the dictatorship of the proletariat; V andervelde deals more with the state, while Kautsky deals more with the dictatorship.
Both obscure the very close and inseparable connection that exists between tP.
e two subjects.
Both are revolutionaries and Marxists in words, but renegades in practice, who exert all their efforts to dissociate them­ selves from revolution.
Neither of them betrays even a trace of what permeates all the works of Marx and Engels, and of what dis­ tinguishes socialism from a bourgeois caricature of it, namely, the 1 Appendix I, "Theses on the Constituent Assembly," will he found in Selected Works, Vol.

14* 211 from the tasks of reform, the elucidation of revolutionary tactics as distinct from reformist tactics, and the elucidat,ion of the role of the proletariat in the abolition of the system of wage slavery as distinct from the role of the proletariat of the "Great Powers" in sharing with the bourgeoisie a particle of the latter's imperialist super-profits and super-booty.
We will quote a few of the most important arguments of Van­ dervelde in support of this appraisal.
Like Kautsky, V andervelde quotes Marx and Engels with great zeal, and like Kautsky, Vandervelde quotes from Marx and Engels everything except what is disagreeable to the bourgeoisie and what distinguishes a revolutionary from a reformist.
He has plenty to say about the conquest of political power by the proletariat, since prac­ tice has long ago confined this within strictly parliamentary limits.
But not a single word does he say about the fact that after the ex­ perience.
of the Paris Commune, Marx and Engels found it necessary to supplement the, in part, obsolete Communist Manifesto with an elucidation of the truth that the working class cannot simply take possession of the ready-made state machine but must smash it.
Van­ dervelde, like Kautsky, as if by agreement, ignores what is most essential in the experience of the proletarian revolution, precisely that which distinguishes the proletarian revolution from bourgeois reforms.
Like Kautsky, Vandervelde also speaks about the dictatorship of the proletariat, _in order to repudiate it.
Kautsky did it by gross falsifications, while Vandervelde does it in a more subtle way.
In one of the sections of his book, section 4, "The Conquest of Poli­ tical Power by the Proletariat," he devotes sub-section b to the ques­ tion of the "collective dictatorship of the proletariat," "quotes" Marx and Engels (I repeat, omitting all the references to the main point, namely, the smashing of the old, bourgeois-democratic state machine), and concludes: "~n Socialist circles, the social revolution is commonly conceived in the followmg manner: a new Commune, this time victorious not in one centre but in all the main centres orthe capitalist world.
, ' "A hypothesis, but a hypothesis which has nothing improbable about in many countries see unprecedented class conflicts and social convulsions.
"But if the failure of the Paris Commune, .
not to speak of the difficulties of the Russian revolution, proves anything at all, it is that it is impossible to put an end to the capitalist system of society until the proletariat has been sufficiently trained to make proper use of the power which the force of certain circumstances may put into its han_ds" (p.
73).
And nothing more on the essence of the question! Such are the leaders and representatives of the Second Interna­ tional! In 1912 they signed the Basie Manifesto, which openly speaks of the connection the very war which broke out in 1914 has with the proletarian revolution, and actually threatens to bring it about; and when the war actually broke out and a revolutionary situation was created, the Kautskys and Vanderveldes began to dis­ sociate themselves from the revolution.
A revolution of the Paris Commune type, don't you see, is only a probable hypothesis! This is quite analogous to Kautsky's arguments about the possible role of the Soviets in Europe.
But this is just the argument of the ordinary educated liberal, if ' who will, no doubt, agree that a new Comri:uine is "not improbable," that the Soviets have a great future before them, etc.
The proletarian revolutionary differs from the liberal in that he, as a theoretician, analyses the new state significance of the Commune and the Soviets.
Vandervelde, however, says nothing about what Marx and Engels said on the subject in detail in their analyses crf the experience of the Paris Commune.
As a practical politician, a Marxist should have made it clear that only traitors to socialism can evade the task of explaining the need for a proletarian revolution (of the Commune, of the Soviet, or perhaps of some other type) , of explaining the necessity of preparing for it, of preaching revolution among the masses, of refuting the petty-b'ourgeois prejudices against it, etc.
But neither Kautsky nor Vandervelde does anything of the sort, because they themselves are traitors to socialism, who only want to maintain their reputation as Socialists and Marxists among the workers.
Take the theoretical formulation of the question.
The state, even in a democratic republic, is nothing more nor i ii' less than a machine for the suppression of one class by another.
Kautsky is familiar with this axiom, admits it, agrees with it, but evades the fundamental question 1;1s to what class the proletariat ought to suppress when it establishes the proletarian state, for what reasons, and by what means.
.
V andervelde is familiar with, admits, agrees with and quotes this fundamental proposition of Marxism (p.
72 of his book); but he does not say a single word on the highly "unpleasant" (for the capitalists) subject of the suppression oj the resistance of the ex­ ploiters! Both Vandervelde and Kautsky have completely evaded this "unpleasant" subject.
Therein lies their renegacy.
Like Kautsky, Vandervelde is a past master in the art of sub­ stituting eclecticism for dialectics.
"On the one hand, it is so, but, on the other hand, it isn't," and so forth.
On the one hand the t "h .
' erm _state means t e nat10n as a whole" (see Littre's Dictionary-certamly a learned work-which Vandervelde quotes, cf.
p.
87) ; o~ _the other hand, the -term state may mean the "government" (~bid.
).
~ ~nde~velde quotes this learned platitude with approval, side by siae with the quotations from Marx.
':Th~, Mll:rxian meaning of the term state differs from the ordinary meamng, "'.

Hence "misunderstandings" may arise as a result of this.
Marx and Engels regard the state not as the state in the broad sense, .
.
not a state as an organ of guidance, as the representative of the general mterests of society (interets generaux de la societe).
It is ~he state-as the organ _of political power, the state-as the organ of author­ ity, the state-as the mstrument of the rule of one class over another" (pp.
75-76).
Marx and Engels speak about the destruction of the state in regard to the second interpretation of the state.
• .
.
"Propositions of too absolute b character run t~e ~isk of being inexact.
There are many transitional stages etween the capitalist state, which is based on the exclusive rule of one class, and the proletarian state, the aim of which is to abolish all classes" (p.
156).

The eclectic does not want propositions that are "too absolute" ' "transitional stages" for revolution.
Kautsky and Vandervelde say nothing about the fact that the transitional stage between the state as an organ of the rule of the capitalist class and the state as an organ of the rule of the proletariat is revolution, which means overthrowing the bour­ geoisie and breaking up, smashing its state machine.
Kautsky and Vandervelde obscure the fact that the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie ;m§!sfive way to the dictatorship of one class, the proletariat, ancr"tilatthe "transitional stages" of the revolution will be followed by the "transitional stages" of the gradua} wither­ ing away of the proletarian state.
Therein lies their poHtical renegacy.
Therein, theoretically, philosophically, lies their substitution of ·eclecticism and sophistry for dialectics.
Dialectics are concrete and revolutionary and distinguish between the "transition" from the dictatorship of one class to the dictatorship of another, and the "transition" from the democr·atic proletarian state to the non-state ("the withering away of the state").
To please the bourgeoisie, the eclecticism and sophistry of the Kautskys and the Vanderveldes blur all that is concrete and precise in the class struggle and ad­ vance the general concept "transition," under which they can hide (and nine-tenths of the official Social-Democrats of our time do hide) their renunciation of revolution.
As an eclectic and sophist, Vandervelde is more skilful and more subtle than Kautsky, because the phrase, "transition from the.
state in the narrow sense to the state in the broad sense," can serve as a means of evading all the problems of revolution, all the differ­ ences between revolution and reform, and even the difference be­ tween the Marxist and the liberal.
For what educated European bourgeois would think of denying, "in general," "transitional stages" in this "general" sense? Vandervelde writes: "I agree with Jules Guesde that it is impossible to socialise the means cf production and exchange without first fulfilling the following two condi-tions: "l) The transformation of the present state as the organ of the rule one class over another into what Menger calls a people's labour state,* by the conquest of political power by the proletariat; "2) Separation of the state as an organ of authority from the state as an organ of guidance, or, to use the expression of Saint-Simon, of the government of men from the administration of things" (p.
89).
Vandervelde puts the above in italics in order to emphasise the importance of these propositions.
But this is sheer eclectical hodge­ podge, a complete rupture with Marxism! The so-called "people's labour state" is just a paraphrase of the old "free people's state," * * · which the German Social-Democrats paraded in the 'seventies and which Engels branded as an absurdity.
The term "people's labour state" is.
worthy of petty-bourgeois democrats (like our Left Socialist-Revolutionaries), it is a phrase which substitutes non-class concepts for class concepts.
Vandervelde places the conquest of state power by the proletariat (by one class) in juxtaposition with the "people's" state and fails to see the muddle he has cre;ited.
Kautsky, with his "pure democracy," creates the same muddle and betrays the same anti-revolutionary, philistine disregard of the tasks of the class revolution, of the class, the proletarian dictatorship, of the class (proletarian) state.
Further, the government of men will disappear and give way to the administration of things only when the state as such disappears.
By talking about this relatively distant future, Vandervelde ob­ scures, pushes into the background, the tasks of tomorrow, viz.
, the overthrow of the bourgeoisie.
This trick is also equivalent to suhserviency to the liberal bour­ geoisie.
The liberal is willing to talk about what will happen when .
it will not he necessary to govern men.
Why not indulge in such innocent dreams? But we won't say anything about the proletariat having to crush the bourgeoisie's resistance to its expropriation.
The class interests of the bourgeoisie demand this.
Socialism versus the state.
This is Vandervelde's bow to the proletariat.
It is not difficult to make a how; every "democratic" politician can make a how to his electors.
And under cover of a "how" an anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian policy is pursued.
V andervelde extensively paraphrases Ostrogorsky to show what deceit, violence, corruption, -mendacity, hypocrisy and oppress~on of the poor is hidden under the civilised, polished, and perfumed exterior of modern bourgeois democracy; but he draws no conclu­ sion from this.
He fails to observe that bourgeois democracy s~p­ presses the toiling and exploited masses, .
a_nd that proletarian democracy will have to suppress the bourgeoisie.
K~utsky and Van­ dervelde are completely blind to this.
The class rnterests of .
the bourgeoisie, in whose wake these petty-bourgeois traitors to Mar~1sm are floundering, demand that this question be eva_ded, that_ it he hushed up, or that the necessity of such suppress10n be directly denied.

_ "DEMOCRACY" AND DICTATORSHIP * THE few issues of the Berlin Rote Fahne and the Vienna Weckruf­ the organ of the Communist Party of German Austria-which have reached Moscow show that the traitors to ,socialism, who supported the war of the predatory imperialists, all the Scheidemanns and Eberts, the Austerlitzes and Renners, are meeting with the well­ deserved resistance of the true representatives of the revolutionary proletarians of Germany and Austria.
We warmly greet the two organs, which are indicative of the virility and growth of the Third InternationaL Evidently, the principal question of the revolution in Germany and in Austria is now the question: Constituent Assembly or Soviet government? All the representatives of the bankrupt Second Interna­ tional, from the Scheidemanns to the Kautskys, stand for the for­ mer and describe their point of view as defence of "democracy" (Kautsky even went so far as to say "pure democracy"), as against dictatorship.
I have examined Kautsky's views in detail in the pam­ phlet recently published in Moscow and Petrograd entitled The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky.
1 I shall try briefly to outline the quintessence of the controversial question which has now come to the fore in a practical manner in all ad­ vanced capitalist countries.
The Scheidemanns and the Kautskys speak of "pure democracy," or of "democracy" in general, in order to deceive the masses and to conceal from them the bourgeois character of modern democracy.
Let the bourgeoisie continue to hold in their hands the whole ap­ paratus of state power, let a handful of exploiters continue to use the old bourgeois state machine.
The bourgeoisie, of course, like to call elections conducted under such conditions "free," "equal," "democratic" and "popular" elections, because these words serve to conceal the truth, serve to conceal the fact that the means of 1 In this volume.

218 I I I I the exploiters and that therefore there can be no thought of r:al hb~rty and real equality for the exploited, i.
e.
, for the overwhelmmg ma] or­ ity of the population.
The bourgeoisie finds it advantageous and necessary to conceal the bourgeois character of m_odern democracy from the people and to depict it as democracy m general, or as "pure democracy"; and the Scheidemann~, and a~so the Kautskys, in repeating this, in fact abandon the pomt.
~f view of the prole­ tariat and desert to the side of the bourgeoisie.
When on the last occasion they jointly signed a preface to The Communist Manifesto (this was in 1872), Marx and Engels thought it necessary to draw the attention of the workers to the fact t~at the proletariat cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made (i.
e.
, bourgeois) state machine and use it for its own purposes, b~t that it must break, must smash it.
The renegade Kautsky has w_ntt,~n.
a whole pamphlet about the "dictatorship of the proletariat, m which he conceals this extremely important Marxian truth from the workers and absolutely distorts Marxism; and it goes without sa~­ ing that the praises which Scheidemann and Co.
heaped upon this pamphlet were the well-deserved praises that th~ agents of the bourgeoisie heap upon those who desert to the side of the hour· geoisie.
.
To speak of pure democracy, of democracy m general, of equ~l-ity, of liberty, and of the people, while the workers and all the toil­ ers are starVing and in rags, are ruined and tortured, not only by capitalist wage-slavery, but also by four ye~rs of predatory.
w_ar, while the capitalists and the profiteers contmue to own their ill­ gotten "property" and their "ready-made" apparatus of state power, means mockino-at the toilers and the exploited.
It means fl;ing in the face of the fundamental truths of Marxism which taught the workers: you must utilise bourgeois democracy.
as something which marks enormous historical progress compar~d with feudalism, but you must not for a moment forget the bo~rgeois c~ar­ acter of this "democracy," its historical conventionality and lim­ itations you must not share the "superstitious belief" in the "state,',' you must not forget that even under the most ~emocr~tic republic, and not only under a monarchy, the state is nothmg more than a machine for the suppression of one class .
by another.
or de­ mocracy in general or pure democr_acy, when as a matter of fact it is the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, the dictatorship of the exploiters over the m~sses of the toilers.
The Scheidemanns and the Kautskys, th~ A~sterhtzes and Renners (now, unfortunately, with the aid of Fnednch Adler) support this falsehood and hypocrisy.
But the Marxists, the Communists, expose them and tell the workers and the masses of the toilers the straight and open truth, viz.
, that as a matter of fa.
ct the democratic republic, the Constituent Assembly, popular elections, :tc.
, all represent the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and that.
there is no other way of emancipating labour from the yoke of cap1t~l except.
by substituting the dictatorship of the proletariat for the.
d1ctators~1p of the bourgeoisie.
The dictatorship of the prole­ tanat alo~e is able to liberate mankind from the yoke of capital; ~rom the hes, the sham and hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy, which is a democracy for the rich; it alone is able to establish democracy for the poor, i.
e.
, to make the benefits of democracy really accessible to the ~orkers and the poorest peasants, whereas at the present time (even m the most democratic-bourgeois-republic) the benefits of demo~racy are really inaccessible to the overwhelming majority of the toilers.
Take, for example, the right of assembly and freedom of the press.
The Scheidemanns and Kautskys, the Austerlitzes and Ren­ ners ~ssure the workers that the elections now taking place for the Co~stltu.
ent Assembly in Germany and in Austria are "democratic.
" It is a he, because, in fact, the capitalists, the exploiters, the land­ lo~ds and the pro~teers own nine-tenths of the best premises that are smtable f?r .
meetmgs.
They own nine-tenths of the paper supplies, of the pnntmg pl~nts, etc.
The workers in the towns and the day labourers and agncultural labourers in the rural districts are in fact,.
ke~t out of democracy both by the "sacred right of prope;ty" c.
wh1ch lS guarded by Messieurs the Kautskys and Renners, to whose s1d~, unfortunately, Fr.
iedrich Adler has deserted) and by the bour­ ~eo1s state apparatus, i.
e.
, the bourgeois state officials, the bourgeois Judges, etc.
The present "dght of assembly" and "freedom of the P " .
th G "d ' • .
ress m .
e erman emocratic ' (bourgeois democratic) repub-lic are a he .
and a sham, because, in fact, they represent freedom for to dope the people with fumes of bourgeois newspaper lies, freedom for the rich to "possess" palaces, the best premises, etc.
The dictatorship of the proletariat deprives the capitalists of their palaces, of the best premises, of the printing plants, of the paper warehouses, and hands them over to the toilers.
This will mean substituting "the dictatorship of.
one class" for "popular-," "pure" "democracy"-howl the Scheidemanns and Kaut­ skys, the Austerlitzes and Renners (in unison with their foreign friends, the Gomperses, Hendersons, Renaudels, Vanderveldes, and Co.
).
.
It is not true, we say.
It will be the substitution of the dictator-ship of the proletariat for the actual dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (which is hypocritically concealed by the forms of the democratic bourgeois republic).
It will be the substitution of democracy for the poor for democracy for the rich.
It will be the substitution of the right of assembly and freedom of the press for the majority of the population-the toilers'---for the right of assembly and freedom __ -­ of the press for the minority-the exploiters.
It will be the enor­ mous world-historical expansion of democracy, its transformation from lies into truth, the emancipation of mankind from the fetters of capital, which distorts and curtails all bourgeois democracy, even t11e most "democratic" and republican.
It will be the substitution of the proletarian state for the bourgeois state, and this is the only thing that can lead to the withering away of the state in general.
Why cannot the latter be achieved without the dictatorship of one class? Why is it not possible to pass immediately to "pure" democracy? These are the questions that are asked by rthe hypo­ critical friends of the bourgeoisie, or by naive kleinburger 1 and philistines who are fooled by them.
Our reply is: because in capitalist society only the bourgeoisie or the proletariat can have decisive significance, while the small propri~tors inevitably remain vacillating, impotent and stupid dreamers about "pure," i.
e.
, non-class, or above-class, democracy.
Because it is impossible to emerge from a society in which one class oppresses another except by establishing the dictatorship of the oppressed class.
Because the proletariat alone is able to conquer 1 Petty bourgeois.
-Ed.
the bourgeoisie and overthrow it, for it is the only class that is united nd " h I d" ' · 1· a sc oo e ny capita ism, and is able to lead the vacillatino-masses of the toilers who live in a.
petty-bourgeois ma~ner-to lead them, or at all events "neutralise'' them.
Because only sentimental petty bourgeois and philistines can dream, and deceive themselves a~d the workers by these dreams, of throwing off the yoke of capital w1tho~t a long and difficult period of crushing the resistance of the expl01ters.
In Germany and Austria this resistance has not yet de:eloped on the surface because the expropriation of the expro­ pnator~ has not yet commenced.
This resistance will be.
desperate and fµrious when this expropriation commences.
By concealing this from thems_elves and the workers, the Scheidemanns and Kautskys, the Austerhtzes and Renners betray the interests of the proletariat and at the most decisive moments desert the position of the class str1:g?le and the overthrow of the yoke of the bourgeoisie for the pos1t10n of ~~mpro~ise ~etween the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, fo_r the pos1t10~ of social peace," or of reconciling the exploiters with the exploited.
"Revolution is the locomotive of history," said Marx.
Revolution teaches ~uickly.
The workers in the towns and the agricultural la­ bourers m the rural districts of Germany and Austria will soon understand that the Scheidemanns and the Kautskys, the Austerlitzes a~d Renners have betrayed the cause of socialism.
The proletariat will throw off these "social-traitors," these Socialists in words and trait~rs to socialism in deeds, in the same way as the proletariat in Russia threw off the same sort of.
petty bourgeoisie and philistines the Men~he~iks and "So~!alist-Revolutionaries.
" The more complet~ the.
domm~tion of these leaders" will he, the sooner will the prole­ tariat realise that only the substitution of a state of the Paris Com­ mune type (about which Marx, who has been misinterpreted and be­ trayed by ~he Scheidernanns and Kautskys, said so much), or a state of the Soviet type, for the bourgeois state, even the most democratic bourgeois rep~blic,_ ca~ open the road to socialism.
The dictatorship of the proletariat will liberate mankind from the yoke of capital and from war.
December 23, 1918 THESES AND REPORT ON BOURGEOIS DEMOCRACY AND THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT* Submitted to the First Congress of the Communist International, M.
arch 4, 1919 1.
The growth of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat in all countries has called forth the convulsive efforts of the bour­ geoisie and of its agents in the working class organisations to find ideological political arguments in defence of the rule of the exploit­ ers.
Of these arguments, the condemnation of dictatorship and de­ fence of democracy are put in the forefront.
The sham and hypocrisy of this argument, reiterated in a thousand sharps and flats in the capitalist press and at the Berne Conference of the yellow Interna­ tional in February 1919, are obvious to all those who desire to remain loyal to the fundamental principles of socialism.
2.
First of all this argument operates with the concepts "democ­ racy in general" and "dictatorship in general" without putting the question as to which class is concerned.
This non-class or above· class, alleged general democratic presentation of the question is a downright mockery of the fundam~ntal tenet of socialism, viz.
, the tenet of the class struggle, which the Socialists who have deserted to the side of tlie bourgeoisie recognise in words, but actually forget.
There is not a single civilised capitalist country in the world in which "democracy in general" exists; what exists is bourgeois dem­ ocracy, and what we are discussing is not "dictatorship in general," but the dictatorship of the oppressed class, i.
e.
, of the proletariat, over the oppressors and exploiters, i.
e.
, the bourgeoisie, with the ob­ ject of overcoming the resistance of the exploiters in their struggle to preserve their rule.
3.
History teaches that not a single oppressed class has ever come into power, or could come into power, without passing through the 223 --------sistance which the exploiters always put up.
The bourgeoisie, whose rule the Socialists who oppose ,"dictatorship in general" and who bow down before "democracy in general" now defend achieved power in the advanced countries by means of a number of ~ehellions by civil wars, by the violent suppression of kings, feudal barons and slave-owners, and their attempts at restoration.
In their hooks and ~amphlets, in the resolutions of their congresses and in their agita­ t10nal speeches, the Socialists of all countries ha¥e explained to the people the class character of these bourgeois revolutions of this hourg17ois dictatorship, a thousand and a million times.
He~ce, the present defence of bourgeois democracy cloaked in speeches about "de~nocracy ~n general" and the present howling and shouting agamst the dictatorship of the proletariat cloaked by cries about "dictatorship in general" are a downright betrayal of socialism the p_ractical desertion to the side of the bourgeoisie, the denial of the nght of the proletariat to make its own, proletarian revolution, and defence of bourgeois reformism at the very historical moment when bourgeois reformism is bankrupt all over the world, and when the war has created a revolutionary situation.
4.
I~ explaining the class character of bourgeois civilisation, of ~ourgeo1s democracy and of bourgeois parliamentarism, all Social­ ists express the idea which was most scientifically expressed by Marx and E~ge.
ls whe~ they said that even the most democratic bourgeois repu~hc is nothmg more than a machine for the suppression of the workmg class ~y t~e bourgeoisie, of the masses of the toilers by a handful of c.
ap1tahsts: Every one of the revolutionaries, every one of the Marxists who is now shouting against dictatorship and for d~ocracy has sworn and assured the workers that he recognises this fun~am~n~al truth of socialism; hut now, when the revolutionary proletariat rs m a state of ferment and motion, which are directed towards.
the destruction of this machine of oppression and towards the.
a~h1evement of the proletarian dictatorship, these traitors to socialism try to make it appear that the bourgeoisie granted the toilers "pure democracy," that the bourgeoisie has ceased to resist and is prepared to submit-to the majority of the toilers, and that no existed, in a democratic republic.
5.
The Paris Commune-which all the would-be Socialists hon· our in words, because they know that the masses of the workers warmly and sincerely .
sympathise with it-most strikingly illustrated the historical conventionality and limited value of bourgeois par· liamentarism and of bourgeois democracy-institutions which are extremely progressive compared '.
vith medirevalism, but which in­ evitably require fundamental transformation in the epoch of prole' tarian revolution.
It was Marx who best of all appraised the his­ torical significance of the Paris Commune, and in analysing it re­ vealed the exploiting character of bourgeois democracy and of hour· geois parliamentarism under which the oppressed classes receive the right once every few years to decide which of the representatives of the uropertied classes shall "misrepresent" 1 the people in parlia· men~.
It is precisely at the present time, when the Soviet movement, having spread to the whole world, is in the sight of all continuing the cause of the Paris Commune, that the traitors to socialism forget the concrete experience and the concrete lessons of the Paris Com· mune and repeat the old bourgeois piffle about "democracy in gen· eral.
" The Paris Commune was not a parliamentary institution.
6.
Furthermore, the significance of the Paris Commune lies in the fact that it made an attempt to smash, to destroy the bourgeois state, bureaucratic, juridical, military and police apparatus to its foundations and to substitute for it self-governing mass organisations of the workers in which there would be no division between legisla­ tive and executive authority.
All modern bourgeois-democratic re­ publics, including the German Republic, which the traitors to social­ ism, in mockery of the truth, describe as a proletarian republic, pre­ serve this state apparatus.
Thus, again and again we get striking confirmation of the fact that cries in defence of "democracy in gen· eral" are really cries in defence of the bourgeoisie and of its exploit· ing privileges.
7.
"The right of assembly" may he taken as an example of the demands of "pure democracy.
" Every class conscious worker who 1 See Marx, The Civil War in France.
-Ed.
15 exploiters in the period and in the circumstances in which the ex­ ploiters are resisting their overthrew and are defending their priv­ ileges.
Neither in England in 1649 nor in France in 1793 did the bourgeoisie, when it was revolutionary, grant.
"the right of assem­ bly'' to the monarchists and nobles who called for the intervention of foreign troops and who "assembled" for the purpose of organ­ ising attempts at restoration.
If the modern bourgeoisie, which be­ came reactionary long ago, demands that the proletariat give it guarantees beforehand that it will give "the right of assembly" to the exploiters-irrespective of Llie resistance the capitalists put up to their expropriation-the proletariat will only laugh at the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie.
On the other hand, the workers know perfectly well that even in the most democratic bourgeois republics "the right of assembly" is but an empty phrase, because the rich own all the best public and private buildings and sufficient leisure to attend meetings, which are protected by the bourgeois state apparatus.
The proletarians of tovm and country and the small peasants, i.
e.
, the overwhelming majority of the population, do not enjoy either the first, the second.
or the third of these privileges.
As long as this situation prevails, "equality," i.
e.
, "pure democracy" is a sham.
In order to achieve real equality, in order to realise democracy for the toilers in fact, it is first of all necessary to deprive the exploiters of all public and luxurious private buildings, it is first of all necessary to give leisure to the toilers, and to have the freedom of their assemblies protected by the armed workers and not by the sons of the aristocracy or capitalist officers commanding browbeaten soldiers.
.
Only after this change has taken place will it be possible, with­ out mocking at the workers, the toilers and the poor, to speak of freedom of assembly, of equality.
And nobody but the vanguard of the toilers, viz.
, the proletariat, which overthrows the exuloiters the, bourgeoisie, can bring about this change.
• ' 8.
"Freedom of the press'' is another of the principal slogans of "pure democracy.
" Here, too, the workers know, and the Socialists of all countries have admitted a million times, that this freedom is ruled by capital-which rule rcanifests itselr the more stnkmg-1y, more sharply and more cynically, the more de~ocracy a:id the republican system are developed, as for example m Amenc~.
In order to, achieve real equality and real democracy for the to1le_rs, for the workers and peasants, it is first of all necessary to depnve capitai of the opportunity of hiring writers, of buying up publishing houses and bribi~g newspapers, and it is necessary to overthrow t~e yoke of capital, to overthrow the exploiters and to suppress their resistance.
By "freedom" the capitalists have always meant the free­ dom of the rich to accumulate profits, and the freedom of the work­ ers to die of starvation.
By freedom of the press the capitalists mean the freedom of the rich to bribe the press, freedom to utilise wealth for the purposes of fabricating a'1d manipulating so-called public H h h · · f " d cr~cy" prove i·n opinion.
ere, too, Le c amp10i:s o pure emo "' .
· fact to be champions of the filthy and venal system by which the rich control the means for the education of the masses, they prove to he deceivers of the people who, by means of plausible, eloquent and absolutely false phrases, turn the people away from the concrete historical tasks of liberating the press from its bondage to capital.
Real freedom and equality will exist uiider the system which the Communists are building and under which it will be impossible for anyone to enrich himself at anoti1er's expense, under which it will he objectively impossible, either directly or indirectly, to !E1bject the mess to the power of money, and under which there will be noth.
ing to prevent every toiler (or group of toilers in any number) from having and exercising an equal right to use the public printing plants and public stocks of paper.
9.
The history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, even before the war, showed what this notorious "pure democracy" really is under capitalism.
The Marxists have always said that the more developed, the "purer" democrncy is, the more naked, sharp and ruthless becomes the class struggle, the more "purely" the oppres­ sion of capital and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie stand forth.
The Dreyfus case in republican France, the sanguinary shooting down of strikers by mercenaries armed by the capitalists in the free 15* viz.
, that even in the most democratic republics it is the terror and dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which rule and which openly mani­ fest themselves as soon as it begins to seem to the exploiters that the power of capital is tottering.
10.
The imperialist war of 1914-18 finally revealed even to the backward workers the true character of bourgeois democracy even in the freest republics as the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
For the sake of the enrichment of the German or the English group of millionaires or billionaires, tens of millions were killed, and the military dictatorship of the bourgeoisie was set up even in the freest republics.
This military dictatorship continues to exist in the Entente countries even after the rout of Germany.
It was precisely the war that most of all opened the eyes of the toilers, tore down the gar­ lands of artificial flowers which decorated bourgeois democracy and revealed to the people the enormous speculation and profiteering that was going on during the war and in connection with the war.
The bourgeoisie waged this war in the name of "liberty and equal­ ity," and in the name of "liberty and equality" war contractors amassed incalculable wealth.
No efforts of the yellow Berne Inter­ national will succeed in concealing from the masses the exploiting character of now utterly exposed bourgeois freedom, bourgeois equality and bourgeois democracy.
11.
In Germany, in the most developed capitalist country on the Continent of Europe, the very first months of complete republican liberty brought about by the rout of imperialist Germany showed to the German workers and to the whole world the real class nature of the bourgeois democratic republic.
The murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg " is an event of world-historical importance, not only because two of the best people and best leaders of the truly proletarian Communist International met with a tragic fate, but also because it utterly revealed the class nature of an advanced European state, one can say without exaggeration, one of the most advanced in the world.
If arrested persons, i.
e.
, persons taken under the protection of the state authorities, could be murdered with im­ punity by officers and capitalists under a government of social-such a thing could happen is the dictatorship of the bourgeo1s1e.
Those who ex­ press horror at the murder of Karl Liebknecht and.
Rosa Lux~n_iburg, but who fail to understand this truth, betray either stup1d1ty .
or hypocrisy.
"Freedom" in one of the freest ~nd _most advanced repub­ lics of the world, in the German Republic, is freedom to mu_rder the arrested leaders of the proletariat with impunity.
Nor can it he otherwise as long as capitalism exists, because the development of democracy does not blunt but sharpens the class str~1ggle, which has been brought to boiling point by the results and mfluences of the war and its consequences.
Throughout the civilised world Bolsheviks are being deported, persecuted and imprisoned; for example, in one of the freest bo~r-geois republics, Switzerland;* the pogroms against the Bolsheviks f "d .
l" in America, etc.
From the point of view o emocracy m genera or of "pure democracy" it is positively ridiculous for advanced, civilised, democratic countries, which are armed to the teeth, to ~ear the presence of a few score of people from b~ckward, st~rv.
mg, ruined Russia, which the bourgeois newspapers m _tens of m1lhons of copies describe as savage, criminal, etc.
Rus~ia.
Clearl~, ~e social conditions that could give rise to such a crymg contrad1ct10n are in fact the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
' ' h" f 1 l t .
t 12.
Under such circumstances, the dictators 1p o tne pro e ana is not only a fully legitimate means of overthrowing the exploiters and suppressing their resistance, but it is also absolutely necess~ry for the whole mass ·of the toilers as the sole means of protect10n against the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, which brought about the war and is preparing for new wars.
The main thing the Socialists fail to understand and what co~­ stitutes their theoretical shortsightedness, their captivity to ~ourgeo.
1s prejudices and their political treachery to the_ prol.
etaria~, is ~hat m capitalist society, as soon as there is any senous mtens1ficati~n of the class struggle on which it is based, there cannot be any middle course between the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the dictator· ship of the proletariat.
All dreams about some third c_ourse.
a~e me;ely the reactionary lamentations of the petty bourgeois.
This is confirmed by the experience of more than a hundred years of devel-opment of bourgeois democracy and of the labour movement in alI the advanced countries, and particularly by the experience of the past five years.
It is also confirmed ~y the whole science of political economy, by the whole content of Marxism, which explains that ~nder any system of commodity production the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie is economically inevitable and that nothing can take the place of the latter except the class that is developed, multiplied, organised and consolidated by the very development of capitalism, viz.
, the proletarian class.
.
13.
The other theoretical and political mistake Socialists commit is their failure to understand that for thousands of years, from the embryonic form of the age of antiquity, the forms of democracy underwent inevitable change as one ruling class took the place of another.
In the ancient republics of Greece, in the cities of the Middle Ages and in the advanced capitalist countries, democracy has different forms and different degrees of application.
* It would be very absurd to think that the most profound revolution in the .
history of mankind, that the first transference of power from the exploiting minority to the exploited majority that has ever occurred in the world, could proceed within the old framework of the old bourgeois parliamentary democracy, L1.
at it could proceed without extremely sharp changes, without creating new forms of democracy, new institutions embodying the new conditions.
for its application, etc.
14.
The diotatorship of the proietariat is similar to the dictator­ ship of other classes in that, like all dictatorships, it was called forth by the necessity of suppressing the violent resistance of the class that was being deprived of political rule.
The fundamental differ­ ence between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of other classes-the dictatorship of the landlords in the Middle Ages, the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie in all civilised capitalist countries-is that the dictatorship of the landlords and of the bour­ geoisie meant the violent suppression of the resistance of the over­ whelming majority of the population, viz.
, the toilers.
The dictator­ ship of the proletariat, on the contrary, means the violent suppres­ sion of the resistance of the_~xploiters, i.
e.
, the insignificant minor­ ity of the population, the landlords and capitalists.
must inevitably lead, not only to a change in the forms and mstit.
u­ :tions of democracy, speaking generally, but to such a change as will lead to the extension of the actual enjoyment of democracy to those ·who are oppressed by capitalism, to the toiling classes, to a degree fatherto miurecedented in world history.
And indeed, the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat which 'has been already devised, i.
e.
, the Soviet system in Russia, the Rate ,,;ystem in Germany;"' the Shop Stewards' Committees,*<• and ana­ logous Soviet institutions in other countries, all impl~ and s:c~re .
precisely for the toiling classes, i.
e.
, fo~ :he overw~el_mmg ma1on:y -of the population, such aetual opportumties for.
enJ~ymg democratic rights and liberties that nothing even approximatmg .
to 1them h~s .
ever existed even in the best and most democratic nourgeo1s 'I'epublics.
The quintessence of the Soviet system lies in that the permane:i.
t and sole basis of the whole state system, the whole state apparatus, is the mass organisation of precisely those classes that were op­ pressed by capitalism, i.
e.
, the v;orkers and semi-proletarians (peas­ ants who do not exploit the labour of others, and who constantly :have to sell at least part of their labour power) .
It is precisely those masses which, even in the most democratic bourgeois republics, while being equal in law, are in fact prevented by thousand~ _of tricks and devices from taking part in political life and from enioy· h d f .
,.
1 i.
ng democratic rights and liberties, w o are now rawn un arnng~y into constant and, moreover, decisive participation in the democratic administration of the state.
15.
The equality of citizens irrespective of sex, religion, race or nationality, which bourgeois democracy always and everyw~ere promised but never carried out, and because of the :ule of capital­ ism could not carry out, is carried out by the Soviet government, or the dictatorship of the proletariat, immediately and to the full, because only the government of the workers, who are not interested in the private ownership of the means o~ production and 1 ~n the struggle for their division and redivision, Is able to ca~ry tms ~ut.
16.
The old, i.
e.
, bourgeois, democracy and parhamentansm ·were vrganised in such a manner that it was precisely the toiling tration.
The Soviet government, i.
e.
, the dictatorship .
of the prole­ tariat, on the contrary, is organised in such a way as to bring the masses of the toilers closer to the apparatus of administration.
The same aim is pursued by the unification of the legislative and execu­ tive authorities under the Soviet organisation of the state and by the substitution of production unirts, like the factories and works, for the territorial electoral constituencies.
17.
The army was an apparatus of oppression not only under monarchies.
It remains such in all bourgeois republics, even the most democratic.
The Soviet government alone, as the permanent state organisation of precisely the classes that were oppressed by capitalism, is able to abolish the subordination of the army to bour­ geois command and really merge the proletariat with the army, really arm the proletariat and disarm the bourgeoisie, without which the victory of socialism is impossible.
18.
The Soviet organisation of the state is adapted to the lead­ ing role of the proletariat as the class which has been most con­ centrated and educated by capitalism.
The experience of all revolu­ tions and of all movements of oppressed classes, the experience of the world Socialist movement teaches that the proletariat alone is able to unite and lead the scattered and backward strata of the toil­ ing and exploited population.
19.
The Soviet organisation of the state alone is capable of effectively and immediately smashing and finally destroying the old,.
i.
e.
, bourgeois, bureaucratic and juridical apparatus which was preserved, and inevitably had to be preserved, under capitalism, even in the most democratic republics, for it was actually the great­ est obstacle to the application of democracy for the benefit of the workers and the toilers.
The Paris Commune took the first world­ historical step in this direction.
The Soviet government rtook the · second.
· · 20.
The abolition of the state is the aim pursued by all Social­ ists, including, and particularly, Marx.
Until this aim has been achieved, true democracy, i.
e.
, equality and liberty, will be impos' sible.
And it is only Soviet or_proletarian democracy that is leading to this goal practically, because, by unfailingly drawing the mass I organisations of the toilers into constant participation in the ad­ ministration of the ·state, it is beginning immediately to prepare the way for the complete withering away of the state.
.
21.
The complete bankruptcy of the Socialists who gathered m Berne their complete failure to understand the new, i.
e.
, prole­ tarian.
' democracy, is particularly apparent from the following: on February 10, 1919, Branting closed the International Confere~ce_o! the yellow International in Berne.
On February 11, 1919, Frei~eit, a Berlin newspaper, conducted by some of the delegates, published a manifesto to the proletariat issued by the "Independent" Party.
In this manifesto the Scheidemann government is admitted to be a bourgeois aovernment and is accused of wanting to abolish the Soviets whi~h are described as Trager ·und Schutzer der Revofotion­ the vehicles and guardians of the revolution-and a call is _made for the legalisation of the Soviets, for granting them state nght~, for granting them the right to suspend the decisions of the Constituent Assembly and to submit them to a referendum.
This proposal is evidence of the complete ideological _bankruptcy of the theoreticians who defend democracy and who fail to under­ stand its bourgeois character.
The ridiculous attempt_ to c~mbine the Soviet system, i.
e.
, the dicrtatorship of the proletariat, with.
t~e Constituent Assembly, i.
e.
, with the dictatorship of the bourgeolSle, utterly exposes the poverty of mind of the yellow Socialists and Social-Democrats, their petty-bourgeois political reactionariness and their cowardly concessions to the irresistible growth of the power of the new proletarian democracy.

In condemning Bolshevism, the majority of the yellow In~er­ national in Berne, which dared not formally vote on the resolution: that was proposed on this subject out of fear of _the m~sses o~ the workers, acted correctly from the class point of view: It is prec1s~ly this majority that is fully in 'agreement with the R~ssian Men.
shev1ks and Socialist-Revolutionaries and with the Sche1demanns m Ger­ many.
Complaining about persecution by the Bolsheviks, the Rus­ sian Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries tried to conceal the fact that this persecution is called forth hy their participation in the 1 Ffeedom.

-Similarly, the Scheidemanns and their party in Germany are par­ ticipating in the civil war on the side Of the bourgeoisie and against -the workers.
It is quite natural therefore that the majority of the participants in the Berne yellow International should condemn the Bolsheviks.
This expressed not defence of "pure democracy" but the self-defence of those who know and feel that in the civil_ war they side with the bourgeoisie against the proletariat.
That is why, from the class point of view, the decision of the majority of the yellow International must -be regarded as correct.
The proletariat must not fear the truth, but look it <;traight in the face and draw from this all the political conclusions.
Comrades! I would like to add a word or two to the last two points.
I think that the comrades who are to report to us on the Berne Conference will deal with it in greater detail.
During the whole course of the Berne Conference* not a word was said about the significance of the Soviet power.
We in Russia have been discussing this question for two years.
At our Party con­ ference in April 1917 we raised, theoretically and politically, the question: "What is the Soviet power, what is its content and what is its historical significance?" We have been discussing this question for almost two years.
And at our Party congress we shall adopt a resolution on it.
On February 11 the Berlin Freiheit published a manifesto to the German proletariat signed, not only by the leaders of the Inde­ pendent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, but also by all the members of the Independent Social-Democratic fraction in the Reichstag.
In August 1918, Kautsky, one of the biggest theoreticians of these Independents, wrote a pamphlet entitled The Dictatorship of the Proletariat,1 in which he declared that he was a supporter of democracy and of the Soviet bodies, but that the Soviets must bear -only economic significance and must not be regarded as state organ­ isations.
Kautsky says the same thing in Freiheit of November 11 J1nd January 12.
On February 9 an article appeared by Rudolf 1 See note to p.
33.
*-Ed.
G:heoreticians of the Second International, in which he proposed juridically, by legislation, to unite the Soviet system with the Na­ tional Assembly.
This was on February 9.
On February 11 this proposal was adopted by the whole of the Independent Party and was published in the form of a manifesto.
Notwithstanding the fact that the National Assembly already exists, and that "pure democracy" has already been embodied in :reality, after the biggest theoreticians of the Independent Social.
Democratic Party have declared that the Soviet organisations must not be state organisations, in spite of all this-again there is vacilla­ i:ion ! This proves that these gentlemen have really failed to under­ stand anything about the new movement and about the conditions of its struggle.
But it also proves something else, namely, that there must be conditions and causes which give rise to these vacillations! When, after all these events, after nearly two years of victorious revolution in Russia, resolutions like those adopted at the Berne Conference are uresented to us in which not a word is said about the Soviets and ;heir significance, when not a single delegate utters a single word about them, we have a perfect right to say that all -these gentlemen are dead to us as Socialists and theoreticians.
But comrades, from the practical point of view, from the point of view of politics, the fact that these Independents, who in theory -and on principle have been opposed to these state organisations,· suddenly make the stupid proposal to "peacefully" unite the Na­ tional Assembly with the Soviet system, i.
e.
, to unite the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie with the dictatorship of the proletariat, shows that great changes are taking place among the masses.
We see that these Independents are bankrupt in the Socialist and theoretical -sense and that an enormous change is taking place among the masses.
The backward masses of the German proletariat are coming to us, have come to us! Thus, the significance of the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, the best section of the Berne Conference, is equal to zero from the theoretical and Socialist point of view.
Still, it has some significance, and that is that these vacillating elements serve as an index of the moods of the backward sections of the proletariat.
This is the great historical significance of this in my opinion.
We experienced something of the kind in our own revolution.
Our Mensheviks traversed almost exactly the same path of development as th.
at traversed by the theoreticians of the Independents in Germany.
At first, when they were in the majority in the Soviets, they were in favour of the Soviets:"· All we heard then was "Long live the Soviets!" "For the Soviets!" "The Soviets are revolutionary democracy!" When, however, we Bolshe­ viks secured the majority in the Soviets, they began to sing a dif­ ferent song; they said: the Soviets must not exist side by side with the Constituent Assembly.
And various Menshevik theoreticians made similar proposals for uniting the Soviet system with the Con­ stituent Assembly and for absorbing them in the state organisations.
Once again it is revealed that the general course of the proletarian revolution is the same throughout the world.
First, the spontan~ous formation of Soviets, then their spread and development, and then, the rise of the practical question: Soviets or National~Assembly, or Constituent Assembly, or bourgeois parliamentarism? Utter confu­ sion among the leaders, and finally~the proletarian revolution.
But I do not think that we ought to present the question in this way after two years of revolution; we ought to adopt a concrete decision because, for us, and particularly for the majority of the West Euro­ pean countries, the spreading of the Soviet system is a most im­ portant task.
I would like to quote only one Menshevik resolution.
I have asked Comrade Obolensky to translate it into German.
He promised to do this, hut, I am sorry to say, he is not here.
I will try to quote it from memory, as I have not the full text with me.
It is very difficult for a foreigner who has not heard anything about Bolshevism to arrive at an opinion about our controversial questions.
All that the Bolsheviks assert is challenged by the Men­ sheviks and vice versa.
Of course, things cannot be different in the midst of a struggle, and that is why it is so important that the last conference of the Menshevik Pa11ty, held in December 1918, adopted a long and detailed resolution which was published in full in the Menshevik Gazeta Pechatnikov.

In Rote Fahne 2 I read an article opposing the formation of peasant Soviets, but quite properly supporting the formation of Soviets of agricultural labourers and poor peasants.
The bourgeoisie and its lackeys, like Scheidemann and Co.
, have already issued the slogan of peasant Soviets.
"* We require only Soviets of agricultural labourers and poor peasants.
Unfortunately, judging from the reports of Comrades Albert, Platten and others, very little is being done, with the exception of Hungary,** to spread the Soviet system in the rural districts.
Herein, perhaps, lies the practical and rather serious danger for the achievement of certain victory by the German· proletariat.
Victory can be assured only when not only the urban, but also the rural proletarians are organ­ ised, and organised not as they were organised before-in trade unions and co-operative_ societies-but in Soviets.
We were able to, achieve victory comparatively easily because in October 1917 we marched with the peasantry, with the whole of the peasantry.
In that sense, our revolution at that tin'e was a bourgeois revolution.
The first step our proletarian government took was to embody in a law promulgated on November 8 [October 26], 1917, *H· on the morrow of the revolution, the old demands of the whole of the peasantry which the peasant Soviets and village assemblies had put forward even under Kerensky.

In the rural dis­ tricts our revolution continued to be a bourgeois revolution arn1 only later, after the lapse of six months, were we compelled within the framework of the state organisations to introduce Llie class strug­ gle in the rural districts, to establish Committees of Poor Peasants, s of semi-proletarians, in every village, and systematically to fight the rural bourgeoisie.
This was inevitable in Russia o·wing to the back­ wardness of the country.
In Western Europe things will proceed differently, and that is why w0 must emphasise the fact that the 1 Germany and Switzerland.

Third: We must say that the winning of a Communist majoritv in the Soviets is the principal rtask in all countries in which th~ Soviet government is not yet victorious.
Our Resolutions Commis­ sion discussed this question yesterday.
Perhaps other comrades will express their opinion on it; but I would like to propose that these three points be adopted as a special resolution.
Of course, we can­ not prescribe the path of development.
It is quite probable that the revolution will come very soon in many"West European countries, bu~ we, as the organised section of the working class, as a party, strive and must strive to gain the majority in the Soviets.
Then our victory will be assured and no power on earth will be able to do a~ything again.

' A CONTRIBUTION TO THE HISTORY OF THE QUESTION OF DICTATORSHIP * THE question of the dictatorship of the proletariat is the fundamen­ tal question of the modern working class movement in all capitalist countries without exception.
For the complete elucidation of this question, a knowledge of its history is necessary.
On an international scale the history of the doctrine of revolutionary dictatorship in gen­ eral and of the dictatorship of the proletariat in particular coincides with the history of revolutionary Socialism and especially with the history of Marxism.
Moreover-and this, of course, is the most important thing-the history of all revolutions of the oppressed and exploited classes against the exploiters constitutes the principal material and source of our knowledge on the question of dictator­ ship.
Those who have not understood the necessity of the dictatorship of any revolutionary class for its victory have failed to understand anything of the history of revolution, or else do not want to know anything about it.
As far as Russia is concerned, of especial 'Significance, if we are to speak of theory, is the programme of the Russian Social-Demo­ cratic Labour Party, drafted in 1902-03 by the editorial board of Zarya and Iskra,** or rather by G.
V.
Plekhanov, and edited, amended and endorsed by this editorial board.
In this programme the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat is presented clearly and definitely, and it is presented precisely in connection with the struggle against Bernstein, against opportunism.
But of the greatest significance, of course, is the experience of revolution, i.
e.
, in Russia, the experience of the year 1905.
The last three months of that year-Oatober, November and December-constituted a period of a remarkably strong, broad, revolutionary mass struggle, a period of the combination of the two most powerful weapons of this struggle: the political mass strike 16 241 already in May 1905, the Bolshevik congress, the "Third Congre!s of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party," recognised "the task of organising the proletariat for the direot struggle against the autocracy by means of an armed uprising" as "one of the principal and urgent tasks of the-Party," and instructed all the Party units to "explain the role of political mass strikes, which may he of great importance at the beginning of and during the uprising.
") For the first time in history the revolutionary struggle attained such a high stage of development and such strength that the armed uprising was combined with the mass strike, this specifically prole­ tarian weapon.
Clearly, this experience is of world-wide significance for all proletarian revolutions.
And the Bolsheviks studied this experience with the greatest attention and zeal from its political as well as from its economic aspect.
I shall mention an analysis of monthly statistics of economic and political strikes of 1905, of the forms of connection ?etween the two, of the high stage of develop­ ment of the strike struggle then attained for the first time in world history.
I presented this analysis in the journal Prosveshchenie in 1910 and 1911, and a brief summary of it was reprinted in the Bolshevik literature published abroad in that period.
Mass strikes and armed uprisings automatically placed on the order of the day the question of revolutionary power and of dicta­ torship, for these methods of struggle inevitably gave rise-at first on a loca~ scale-to the expulsion of the old government authorities, to the seizure of power by the proletariat and the revolutionary classes, to the expulsion of the landlords, sometimes to the seizure of factories, etc.
, etc.
The revolutionary mass struggle of that period called int~ being organisations previously unknown in history, such as the Soviets of Workers' Deputies, and then the Soviets of Soldiers' Deputies, Peasants' Committees, and so on.
Thus, the fundamental questions (the Soviet power and the dictatorship of the proletariat) which are now engaging the minds of class conscious workers all over the world were raised in a practical way at the end of 1905.
While· outstanding representatives of the revolutionary proletariat a~d of unad~lte~ated Marxism like Rosa Luxemburg at once appre­ Ciated the s1gmficance of this praotical experience and made a ing majority of the official representatives of the official Social­ Democratic and Socialist parties-among them both reformists and the future "Kautskyans," "Longuetists," followers of Hillquit in America, etc.
, proved absolutely incapable of grasping the signifi­ cance of this experience and of carrying out their duty as revolu­ tionaries, i.
e.
, of setting to work to study and to propagate the les­ sons of this experience.
In Russia, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, immediately after the defeat of the armed uprising of December 1905,* began to sum up this experience; and this work was particularly accelerated by the fact that in April 1906 the so-called "Unity Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party" took place in Stockholm, at which the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks were represented and formally united.
Preparations for this congress were carried on most energetically by both these factions.
Prior to the congress, at the beginning of 1906, both factions published drafts of their resolu­ tions on all the most important questions.
These draft resolutions­ reprinted in my pamphlet Report on the Unity Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party (Letter to the St.
Peters­ burg Workers), Moscow, 1906 ( 110 pages, of which almost half are taken up with the terts of the draft resolutions of both factions and with the resolutions finally adopted by the congress )-constitute the most important material for a study of the question as it stood at that time.
Already at that time disputes as to the significance of the Soviet! were linked up with the question of the dictatorship.
Even prior to the October Revolution of 1905, the Bolsheviks had raised the ques­ tion of the dictatorship (see my pamphlet The Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution, Geneva, July 1905·1 reprinted in the volume of collected articles, Twelve Year;**).
The Mensheviks were opposed to the slogan of "dictator­ ship.
" The Bolsheviks emphasised that the Soviets of Workers' Deputies were actually "embryos of a revolutionary power," as it was literally worded in the draft of the Bolshevik resolution (p.

Without preparing for the dictatorship one cannort be a real revolutionary.
This truth was not understood by the Mensheviks in 1905; in 1920 it is not under­ stood by the Italian, German, French and other Socialists who are afraid of the strict "conditions" of the Communist International.
" Only those who are capable of recognising the dictatorship in words but who are incapable of preparing for it in deeds can be afraid of these conditions.
Hence, it will not be out of place if I quote at length the explanation of Marx's views which I published in July 1905 in opposition to the Russian Mensheviks, but which is equally applicable to the West European Mensheviks of 1920.
(Instead of giving titles of newspapers, etc.
, I shall merely indicate whether Mensheviks or Bolsheviks are referred to.
) "Mehring tells us in the notes to his edition of Marx's art1cles from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung of 1848 that incidentally the fol­ lowing reproach was hurled at this newspaper in the bourgeois pub­ lications.
The N eue Rheinische Zeitung was alleged to have de­ manded 'the immediate introduction of a: dictatorship as the only means of achieving democracy.
' (Marx, Nachlass,1 Vol.
III, p.
53.
) From the vulgar-bourgeois standpoint the concepts dictatorship and democracy mutually exclude each other.
Not understanding the theory of class struggle and accustomed to seeing in the political arena only a petty squabble of various bourgeois circles and coteries, the bourgeois conceives the dictatorship to be the annulment of all liberties, of all guarantees of democracy, tyranny of every kind, and all possible abuses of power in the personal interests of the dictator.
In effect, it is precisely this vulgar-bourgeois viewpoint that per· meates the writings of our Mensheviks, who attribute the partiality of the Bolsheviks for the slogan dictatorship to Lenin's 'being ob­ sessed by a passionate desire to try his luck.

The reactionary classes are usuall th s alre settled only by force.
y emse ves the first to resort to sistently, everywhere, all over the country, ever since January 22 [9].
And since such a situation has arisen, since the bayonet has really taken first place on the political agenda, since the uprising has become necessary and urgent-the constitutional dreams and school exercises in parliamentarism are becoming only a screen for the bourgeois betrayal of the revolution, a screen for the bour­ geoisie as they 'recoil' from the revolution.
The genuinely revolu­ tionary class must, then, advance precisely the slogan of dictator-ship.
" 1 This is the way the Bolsheviks argued about the dictatorship before the October Revolution of 1905.
After the experiences of this revolution, I made a detailed study of the question of the dictatorship in the pamphlet The Victory of the Cadets and the Tasks of the Workers' Party, St.
Petersburg, 1906 (the pamphlet is dated April 10 [March 28], 1906).
From this pamphlet I shall quote all the most essential arguments, but I shall substitute for a number of proper names a mere indication as to whether the reference is to the Cadets or to the Mensheviks.
In general, this pamphlet was directed against the.
Cadets, but in part it was directed also against the non-party liberals, semi-Cadets and semi-Mensheviks.
In essence, everything that is said about the dicta· torship applies precisely to the Mensheviks, who were constantly slipping over to the side of the Cadets on this question.
"At the very time when the shooting was dying down in Moscow, when the military-police dictatorship was celebrating its wild orgies, when executions and mass tortures were taking place throughout Russia, voices were raised in the Cadet press against violence from the Left, against the strike committees set up by the revolutionary parties .
.
,.
.
The Cadet professors, trading their science with the Du­ basovs, went so far as to translate the word 'dictatorship' as 'rein­ forced guard.
' The 'men of science' even distorted their school Latin in order to belittle the revolutionary struggle.
Dictatorship means_,__.

the form of a dictatorship.
The point is, however, that there i's a di~tatorship of the minority over the majority, of a small body of pol~ce ove~ th_e people; and rthere is also a dictatorship of the overwhelmmg ma1onty of the people over a smaU-group of op~ressors, plunderers, and usurpers of the power of the people.
By the~r vulgar dis.
tortion of the scientific concept of dictatorship, by their howls agamst violence from the Left <l't a time when the most lawless ~nd i:nost despicable acts of violence were being committed by the Right m a regular orgy of debauchery, the honourable Cadets clearly revealed the position of rthe 'compromisers' in the acute revolutionary struggle.
A 'compromiser' hides like a coward when­ ev~r.
the struggle flares up.
When the revolutionary people is vic­ torious (October 30 [I 7]) the 'compromiser' crawls out of his hole struts about vaingloriously, boasts and shouts until he is hoarse: tha~ was a 'glorious' political strike! But when the counter-revolution is ~ictorious, 1the 'compromiser' begins to shower hypocritical admoni­ tions and edifying advice upon the defeated.
A victorious strike is 'glorious.
' Lost strikes are criminal, wild, senseless, anarchistic.
An ~nsuccessful uprising is madness, the raging of the elements, barbar­ ism, folly.
In a word, the political conscience and the political intel­ lect of the 'compromiser' are expressed by his cringing before who­ ever happens to be the stronger at the time, by getting in the way of the combatants and hindering now one and now the other side b~ blunting the struggle and by blunting the revolutionary con: sc10usness of the people, which is waging a desperate struggle for freedom.
" To p~oceed.
It will now he exceptionally opportune to quote the exp_Ianat10ns on the question of dictatorship that were directed agai~st Mr.
_R.
Blank.
In.
1906, this R.
Blank, in a newspaper which was ~n reahty Menshevik, though formally non-party, expounded the views of the Mensheviks and e:Xtolled their "efforts to direct the ~ussian_ Social-Democratic movement along that path along which mternati~:mal Social-Democracy is moving with the great Social­ Democratic Party of Germany at its head.
" In other words, like 1the Cadets, R.
Blank characterised the Bolsheviks as unreaso:na.
ble, :iwn-Marxian, riotous revolutionaries, Social-Democratic Party also in the Menshevik category.
This is the usual method of the international trend of social-liberals, paci­ fists etc.
who in all countries extol the reformists, opportunists, Ka:tsky~ns and Longuetists as "reasonable" Socialists in contra­ distinction to the "unreasonable" Bolsheviks.
In the above-menrtioned pamphlet I replied to R.
Blank as follows: "Mr.
Blank draws a comparison between two periods of the Russian revolution.
The first covers approximately the period from October to December 1905.
This was the period of revolutionary whirlwind.
The second is the present period, which, of course, we may rightly describe as rthe period of Cadet victories in :iie Duma elections, or-if we take the risk of anticipating-the penod of the Cadert Duma.
"Concerning this period Mr.
Blank says that the turn of sense and reason had now come again and that it was possible to turn to intelligent, planned, systematic activity.
The first period, however, Mr.
Blank characterises as a period of divergence between th_eory and practice.
All Social-Democratic principles and ideas disap­ peared, the tactics which had always been advocated by the founders of Russian Social-Democracy were forgotten, and even the very pillars of the Social-Democratic world outlook were torn from their foundations.
"Mr.
Blank's main assertion is of a purely factual character.
The whole theory of Marxism, according to him, was at variance with 'practice' in the period of revolutionary whi:lw_ind.
, .
, "Is that the case? What is the first and prmc1pal pillar of Marxian theory? The thesis that the proletariat is the only thorough­ lv consistent revolutionary class in modern society.
and, consequent­ ly, is the vanguard class in every revolution.
It may be asked: ~id not the revolutionary whirlwind tear this 'pillar' of the Social­ Democratic world outlook from its foundations? No! On the con­ trary, the whirlwind brilliantly proved _its ~rmne.
ss.
It was the proletariat that was the principal fighter m_ this penod and almost the only fighter in the beginning of the penod.
Almost for the first time in history a bourgeois revolution was marked by the employ-to an extent unprecedented even in advanced capitalist countries.
The proletariat took up the directly revolutionary struggle at a time when the honourable Cadets and .
honourable Blanks were calling upon the people to elect representatives to the Bulygin Duma,* when the Cadet professors were calling upon the students to keep to their studies.
** The proletariat with its proletarian weapon of struggle gained for Russia rthe whole of the 'constitution' ***-if one may call it that-which since then has been only spoiled, curtailed, and shorn.
In October 1905, the proletariat applied the tactics of struggle that were indicated six months previously in the resolution of the Bolshevik Third Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, which directed particular attention to the importance of combining the political mass strike with insurrection-and it is precisely the combination of the two that characterises the whole period of 'revolutionary whirlwind,' the whole of the last quarter of 1905.
Thus, our petty-bourgeois ideologist distorted the facts in the most shameful, most crying manner.
He did not point to a single fact that could testify to a divergence between Marxian theory and the practical experience of the 'revolutionary whirlwind.
' He tried to obscure the fundamental feature of this whirlwind which most brilliantly confirmed 'all Social-Democratic principles and ideas,' 'all the pillars of the Social-Democratic world outlook.
' "What, however, is the real reason that caused Mr.
Blank to arrive at the monstrously erroneous opinion that all Marxian prin­ ciples and ideas disappeared in the period of 'whirlwind'? An investigation of this circumstance proves to be most interesting; it reveals to us once again the true nature of philistinism in politics.
"What was the main difference between the period of 'revolu­ tionary whirlwind' and the present 'Cadet' period, from the point of view of the various methods of political activity, from the point of view of the various methods of the people's historical creative­ ness? The first and principal difference was the fact that in the period of 'whirlwind' several special methods of this creativeness were employed which are alien to other periods of political life.
The most essential of these methods were: 1) 'seizure' of political liberty by the people-the exercise-··of this liberty without any rights and universities, freedom of the press, freedom of association, freedom to convene congresses, etc.
); 2) the creation of new organs of revolutionary government-Soviets _of Workers', Soldiers', Rai~ ~ay'.
Workers' and Peasants' Deputies, new village and town authont1es, etc.
, etc.
These organs were created exclusively by.
the revo:utionary.
strata of the population, without laws or norms, m an entirely rev­ olutionary manner, as the product of the inborn creativenes~ of the people, as an expression of the initiative of the ~eople, which had freed itself or was freeing itself from the old police shackles.
The.
se were preci_sely organs of power, notwithstanding their :embryom~, spontaneous, informal and diffusive character ~s regards composi­ tion and method of functioning.
They funct10ned as organs ~f government; for example, when they seized the printing shops (m St.
Petersburg), arrested police officials who hindered the revolu­ tionary people in exercising their rights (instances of such acts occurred also in St.
Petersburg, where the new organ of power was weakest and the old power strongest) .
They acted as a government when they called upon the people not to give money to the old government.
They confiscated the money of the old governi:ient (the railwaymen's strike committees in the South) and used it for the needs of the new government, the people's government.
Yes, these were undoubtedly embryos of a new, of a people's .
gover~ment, .
o~­ if you will-of a revolutionary go_vernmen~.
In i:s social-p~ht1cal character it was, in embryo, the dictatorship of .
he revolut10nary elements of the people.
You are surprised, Mr.
Blank and Mr.
Kiesewetter? You do not see the 'reinforced guard,' which for the bourgeoisie is synonymous with dictatorship? We ha.
ve ~lready told you that you do not in the least understan~ the sc1ent1fic concept dictatorship.
We will explain it to.
yo~ in a mmute, bu; first w~ shall point to the third 'method' of action m the epoch of revo~ut1onary whirlwind': the employment of violence by the people against those who used ~iolence against the people.
"The organs of power we have described were the embryo of dictatorship, for this government recognised no other power, no law, no norm no matter from what source.
Unrestricted power, beyond the law, 'resting on force in the strictest sense of the word-this is dictatorship.
But the force upon which this new power rested and desired to rest was not the force of the bayonet seized by a handful of militarists, not the force of the 'police station,' not the force of money, or of a.
.
'ly of the old, estabfished institutions.
Nothing of the sort.
The new organs of the new power possessed neither weapons, nor money, nor old institutions.
Their force--can you imagine it, Mr.
Blank and Mr.
Kiesewetter?-was totally unlike the old in­ struments of force, totally unlike a 'reinforced guard,' if we leave out of account the reinforced guard of the people against oppression by the police and other organs of the old government.
"On what did this force rest? It rested on the masses of the people.
This is the fundamental distinction between this new power and all the former organs of the old power.
The latter were organs of power of the minority over the people, over the masses of workers and peasants.
The former were organs of power of the people, of the workers and peasants, over the minority, over a handful of police thugs, over a small group of privileged nobles and officials.
That is the distinction between a dictatorship over the people and a dic­ tatorship of the revolutionary people.
Keep this well in mind, Mr.
Blank and Mr.
Kiesewetter! The old power, as a dictatorship of the minority, could maintain itself only by the aid of police stratagems, only by preventing and diverting the masses from participating in the government, from controlling the government.
The old power persistently distrusted <the masses, feared the light, maintained itself by means of deception.
The new power, as a dictatorship of the overwhelming majority, could and did maintain itself only by winning the confidence of" the great masses, only by drawing, in the freest, broadest, and most energetic manner, all the masses into the work of government.
Nothing hidden, nothing secret, no regula­ tions, no formalities.
YOU are a Workingman? YOU wish to fight to liberate Russia from a handful of police thugs? Then you are our comrade.
Choose your delegate at once, immediately.
Choose as you think best.
We shall willingly and gladly accept hi~ as a full member of our Soviet of Workers' Deputies, of our Peasants' Com­ mittee, of our Soviet of Soldiers' Deputies, etc.
, etc.
It is a power that is open to all, that does everything in sight of the masses, that is accessible to the masses:;-that springs directly from the masses; new power, or rather its embryo, for the victory etf the old power very soon trampled upon the tender shoots of this new plant.
· "Perhaps, Mr.
Blank or Mr.
Kiesewetter, you will ask: Why 'dictatorship,' why 'violence'? Need an enormous mass use force against a mere handful? Can tens and hundreds of millions be dic­ tators over thousands, over tens of thousands? "These questions are usually put by those who see the term 'dictatorship' employed in a way that is new to them.
These people are accustomed only to police rule and only to police dictatorship.
The idea that there can be power without police, that there can be a non-police dictatorship seems strange to them.
You say that mil­ lions need not use force against thousands, but you are mistaken, precisely because you do not observe this phenomenon in its pro­ cess of development.
You forget that the new power does not fall from heaven, but springs up and grows side by side with the old power, in opposition to the old power, in conflict with it.
Without the employment of violence against the users of violence who pos­ sess the weapons and organs of power, it is impossible to liberate the people from these oppressors.
"Here is a very simple example for you, Mr.
Blank and Mr.
Kiesewetter, which will help you to understand this piece of wisdom, which is so incomprehensible and so 'head-breaking' for the Cadet mind.
Imagine that A vramov is mutilating and torturing.
Spirido· nova.
* On Spiridonova's side, let us suppose, there were scores and hundreds of unarmed people; on Avramov's side, a handful of Cossacks.
What would the people have done if Spiridonova had been tortured, not in a dungeon, but in a more accessible place? They would have employed force against Avramov and his men.
Perhaps· they would have sacrificed several of their fighters, who would have been shot down by Avramov, but nevertheless, they would have forcibly disarmed Avramov and his Cossacks, in the course of which, probably, several of these men-if one may call them that-would have been killed on the spot, while the rest would have been put into some prison, in order to prevent them from perpetrating further outrages and to turn them over to a people'.
$ court.
see, Mr.
Blank and Mr.
Kiesewetter: when Avramov and his Cossacks torture Spiridonova, that is a military-police dictator­ ship over the people.
When the,revolutionary people (who are capable of fighting the oppressors and not merely of uttering exhortations, admonitions, expressions of regr'et or condemnation, of whining and grieving, who are not narrow-mindedly petty-hour· geois, but revolutionary) employ force against Avramov and his lik~that is a dictatorship of the revolutionary people~ It is a dictatorship, for ii: is the power of the people over the Avramovs, a power unrestricted by laws.
(A petty bourgeois would, perhaps, be opposed to forcibly wresting Spiridonova from the clutches of Avramov.
That would not be 'according to law,' he would say: is there a 'law' which permits the killing of Avramov? Have not cer­ tain ideologists of the petty bourgeoisie created the theory of resist not evil by violence?) The scientific concept 'dictatorship' means nothing more nor less than unrestricted power, absolutely unim­ peded by laws or regulations and resting directly upon force.
This is the meaning of the concept 'dictatorship' and nothing else.
Keep this well in mind, honourable Cadets! Further, in the example we have given we see a dictatorship precisely of the people, because the people, the mass of the population, having in an unorganised way, 'casually' gathered at a giveri spot, come on the scene themselves, administer justice themselves, exercise authority and create a new, revolutionary law.
Finally, it is a dictatorship of the revolu­ tionary people.
Why only of the revolutionary and not of all the people? Because among all the people, who are suffering constantly and most cruelly from the exploits of the Avramovs, there are some , who are physically wrecked and intimidated, some who are morally · wrecked, for-example, by the theory of resist not evil by violence,' or wrecked, not by theory, but by prejudices, habits and routine, indifferent people, the so-called man in the street, the philistine, who is more inclined to avoid a sharp struggle, to pass on the other side, or even to hide from it (so as not to get into trouble!).
That is why the dictatorship is not exercised by the whole people, but.
only by the revolutionary people, who, however, do not in the least fear the whole people, a~g disclose to them the reasons for their actions and for all the constituent parts of these actions, gladly the people, not only into the work of 'administering'_ the state, but also into power, into the "10rk of building up the state.
· "Thus, the simple example we have taken contains all the ele­ ments of the scientific concept 'dictatorship of the revolutionary people' as well as of the concept 'military-police dictatorship.
' From this simple example, which even a learned Cadet professor can understand, we can pass on to more complicated phenomena of social life.
"Revolution-in the narrow, direct sense of the word-is pre-cisely that period in the life of a people in which the century-old anger against the exploits of the Avramovs bursts forth in action, not in words; in the action of vast masses, not of single individuals.
The people wake up and rise to liberate themselves from ~he A vramovs.
The people free the countless Spiridonovas of Russian life from the Avramovs, employ force against the Avramovs, seize power over the Avramovs.
This, of course, does not happen so sim­ ply and so 'suddenly' as in the example we gave, which we simpli­ fied for the benefit of Professor Kiesewetter.
The people's struggle against the Avramovs, the struggle in the narrow, direct sense, this throwing-off of the Avramovs by the people drags on for months and years of 'revolutionary whirlwind;' This throwing-off of the Avramovs by the people is the real content of what is called the great Russian revolution.
Examined from the standpoint of the methods of historical creativeness, this throwing-off takes place in the forms which we described when we spoke about the revolution­ ary whirlwind, namely: seizure of political liberty by the people, i.
e.
, liberty that the Avramovs have prevented the people from enjoying; the creation by the people of a new, revolutionary pow~r, a power over the Avramovs, a power over the old, oppressive pohce regime; the employment of violence by the people against the A vramovs in order to remove, disarm, and render harmless all these mad dogs, all these Avramovs, Durnovos, Dubasovs, Mins,* etc.
, etc.
.
"Is it good that the people use such illegal, irregular, planless, and unsystematic methods of struggle as the seizure of liberty, the creatio~ of a new revolutionary power that is not formally recog· nised by anyone, that they employ force against the oppressors of people? Yes, it is very good.
It is the highest manifestation of the people's struggle for freedom.
It· marks the great times.
when the dreams of liberty of the best people of Russia are transformed into action, the action of the masses themselves, and not of indi­ vidual heroes.
This is as good as rthe crowd liberating (in our example) Spiridonova from the clutches of Avramov, forcibly disarming him and rendering him harmless.
"But this brings us to the central point of the secret thoughts and fears of the Cadets.
The Cadets are the ideologists of philis­ tines because in their views on politics, on the emancipation of all the people, on revolution, they adopt the point ot view of the man in the street who, in our example of the torture of Spiri­ donova by Avramov, would have restrained the crowd, would have advised them not to break the law, not to hurry in liberating the victim from the hands of the executioner who was acting in the name of the legal authorities.
Of course, in our example such a man in the street would be a downright moral pervert, but as applied to the whole of social life, the moral perversion of the petty bour­ geois, is, we repeat, by no means an individual but a social quality, conditioned, perhaps, by the prejudices of the bourgeois-philistine science of law which is firmly entrenched in his brain.
·X· "Why does Mr.
Blank take for granted that all Marxian prin­ ciples were forgotten in the period of the 'whirlwind'? Because he transforms Marxism into Brentano-ism and regards such 'prin­ ciples' as the seizure of freedom, as the creation of a revolutionary power, as the employment of force by the people as non-Marxian.
This viewpoint runs like a thread through the whole of Mr.
Blank's article, and not only through Mr.
Blank's writings but through those of all the Cadets, of all those who are now extolling Ple­ khanov for his love for the Cadets, of all the writers of the liberal and radical camp, including the Bernsteinian editors of Bez Zagla­ viya, *·* Prokopovich, Kuskova, and tutti quanti.
"Let us see how this viewpoint arose, and why it had to arise.
"It arose directly out of the Bernsteinian or, speaking in broader terms, the opportunist conception of West European Social~ Democracy.
Those errors -5£ this conception which the 'orthodox' in the West have been systematically exposing all along the line cover,' in another guise and on a different occasion.
The Bernsteinians have been accepting Marxism without its directly revolutionary side.
They regarded the parliamentary struggle, not as one of the means of struggle that was particularly appropriate in certain historical periods, but as the main and almost exclusive form of struggle, which made 'violence,' 'usurpation' and 'dictatorship' unnecessary.
This vulgar, petty-bourgeois distortion of Marxism is now being brought to Russia by the Blanks and other liberal extollers of Plekhanov.
They have become so accustomed to this distortion that they take it for granted that Marxian principles and ideas are forgotten in the period of revolutionary whirlwind.
"Why should such a viewpoint have arisen? Because it corre­ sponds in the most fundamental way to the class position and interests of the petty bourgeoisie.
The ideologist of 'purified' bour­ geois society recognises all the methods of struggle employed by Social-Democracy except those which the revolutionary people em­ ploy in the period of 'whirlwind,' and the employment of which revolutionary Social-Democracy approves and aids.
The interests of the bourgeoisie require the participation of the proletariat in the struggle against rthe autocracy; but only such participation as will not lead to the supremacy of the proletariat and the peasantry, only such participation as will not entirely abolish the old autocratic, feudal and police organs of power.
The bourgeoisie wants to pre­ serve these organs, but it wants to subject them to its own direct control.
It needs them to use against the proletariat, whose prole­ tarian struggle would be too greatly facilitated by the complete .
abolition of these organs.
That is why the interests of the bour­ geoisie as a class demand both a monarchy and an Upper Chamber; that is why they must prevent the establishment of the dictatorship of the revolutionary people.
Fight the autocracy!--the bourgeoisie says to the proletariat-but do not touch the old organs of power, for I need them.
Fight in a 'parliamentary way,' i.
e.
, within the limits I shall prescribe to you in agreement with the monarchy; fight with the aid of organisations, not with organisations like general strike committees,* Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Depu­ ties, etc.
, but with such as ·are· recognised, restricted, and rendered 17 "Hence it is clear why the bourgeoisie speaks about the period of 'whirlwind' with scorn, contempt, rage and hatred, and why it speaks about the period of constitutionalism upheld by Dubasov * · with ecstasy, rapture, with infinite philistine infatuation .
.
.
· for reaction.
The constant and immutable quality of the Cadets is a striving to gain th!') support of the people and fear of their rev.
olutionary activity.
_ .
_ "It is clear also· why th~ bourgeoisie fears a-repetition of the 'whirlwind' worse than the plague, why it ignores and hushes up the elements of the new revolutionary crisis, why it supports con­ stitutional illusions and spreads them among the people.
"Now ':Ve have fully explained why Mr.
Blank and his ilk de­ clare that all Marxian principles and ideas were forgotten in the period of 'whirlwind.
' Like all petty bourgeois, Mr.
Blank recog­ nises Marxism without its revolutionary side, he recognises Social­ Democratic methods of struggle·.
without the most revolutionary aud directly revolutionary methods.
· "Mr.
Blank's attitude to the period of the 'whirlwind' is ex­ tremely characteristic as an illustration of bourgeois lack of under­ standing of proletarian movements, of bourgeois fear of sharp and determined fighting, of bpurgeois hatred for all manifestations of s~arp,_ revolutio~ary-in the strict sense of the term of solving social­ h1stoncal questions-methods which break up the old institutions.
Mr.
Blank has betrayed himself, he has betrayed all his bourgeois narrow-mindedness at one stroke.
He heard and read that the Social­ Democrats had made 'mistakes' in the period of whirlwind and he haste~ed to conclude from this and to declare with an aplomb ' brookm~ no appeal, bu~ without any proof, that all the 'principles' of Marxism (about which he hasn't the slightest conception) had been forgotten.
In regard to these 'mistakes' we would ask: has there ever ~een a period in the development of the working class movement, m the development of Social-Democracy, in which mis­ takes of one sort or another have not been made; in which-there has ~ot been som~ deviati2_n or o~er either to the Right or to the Left· Is not the history of the parliamentary period· of the struggle minded bourgeois throughout the world regard as the impassable limit-full of such mistakes? If Mr.
Blank were not such an abso· lute ignoramus on questions of socialism, he would easily recall the cases of Miihlberger, Diihring, the question of the Dampfersub· vention, * the 'Young' Socialists;** Bernstein and many, niany others.
But Mr.
Blank does not think that a study of the real course of development of Social-Democracy is important.
All he-wants to do is to belittle the sweep of the proletarian struggle in order .
to · exalt the bourgeois poverty of his own Cadet Party.
--"Indeed, if we examine the matter from the point of view of the deviation of Social-Democracy from its usual 'normal' course, we shall see that in this respect, too, the period of 'revolutionary whirlwind' exhibits not a lesser, but greater consolidation and ideOlogical unity of Social-Democracy, compared with ··other · periods.
The tactics in the epoch of the 'whirlwind' did not separate the two wings of Social-Democracy, but brought them closer.
to one· another.
Instead of the former disagreements there was una· nimity of views 'on the question of the armed uprising.
Social­ Democrats of both factions worked in the Soviets of Workers' De­ puties, ill these· peculiar organs of the embryonic revolutionary power; they drew the soldiers and peasants i,nto these Soviets.
and issued revolutionary manifestoes in conjunction with the petty­ bourgeois revolutionary parties.
The former disputes of the pre.
revolutionary epoch were replaced by solidarity on· practical ques­ tions.
The upsurge of the revolutionary wave thrust disagreements aside, compelled acceptance of fighting tactics; thrust aside the Duma question, put the question of insurrection on the order of the day, brought Social-Democracy and revolutionary bourgeois de~ocracy closer together for direct arid Immediate work.
In Sevemy Golds, 1 the Mensheviks jointly with the Bolsheviks called fur a strike and insurrection; called upon the workers to continue the struggle until they had captured power~ The revolutionary situation itself sug­ gested the practical slogans.

The point is that in their analysis of the characteristics of this or that period (irrespective of our preferences or our sympathies) Mr.

unscrupu­ lously distort the truth.
The point is that it is precisely the revolu­ tionary periods that are distinguished for their greater breadth, greater wealth, greater intelligence, greater and more systematic activity, greater audacity and vividness of historical creativeness compared with periods of philistine, Cadet, reformist progress.

They regard the in· activity of the suppressed, downtrodden masses as the triumph of the 'systematic' activity of -the bureaucrats and the bourgeoisie.
They shout about the disappearance of sense and reason, when the picking to pieces of parliamentary bills by all sorts of bureaucrats and liberal 'penny-a-liners' gives way to a period of direct political activity by the 'common people,' who in their simple way directly and immediately destroy the organs of oppression of the people, seize power, appropriate for themselves what was considered to be • the property of all sorts of plunderers of the people-in a word, precisely when the sense and reason of millions of downtrodden 1 The North Star.

October 20; 1920 ·· PART II THE FUNDAMENTAL TASKS OF THE PARTY AFTER THE SEIZURE OF POWER BY THE PROLETARIAT January-June 1918 J THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE'S COMMISSARS Report Delivered to the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets, _ Januar.
y 24 [11], 1918 * COMRADES! On behalf of the Council of People's Commissars I must submit to you a report of its activities for the two months and fifteen days that have elapsed since the establishment of the Soviet power and the Soviet government in Russia.
Two months and fifteen days-this is only five days more than the preceding workers' government lasted, the government that ruled over a whole country, or over the exploiters and the capital­ ists, viz.
, the government of ithe Paris workers in .
the epoch of the Paris Commune of 1871.
We must first of all remember this workers' go:vernmerit, we must throw our minds back to the past and compare it with the Soviet government that was formed on November 7 [October 25].
And if we compare the preceding dictatorship of the proletariat with the present one we shall see at once what enormous progress the international working class movement has made, and in what an immeasurably more favourable position the Soviet government in Russia finds itself, notwithstanding the incredibly complicated conditions and circumstances of war and ruin in which it has to work.
Retaining power for two months and ten days, the workers of Paris, who for the first time in history established the Commune, which was the embryo of Soviet government, perished at the hands of the French Cadets, Mensheviks and Right Socialist-Revolution­ ary Kaledinites.
.
.
.
The French workers had to pay an unpre­ cedentedly heavy price for the first experience of workers' govern-26$ ment, of the significance and purpose of which the overwhelming majority of the peasants in France were ignorant.
We find ourselves in immeasurably more favourable circum­ stances because the Russian soldiers, workers and peasants were able to create an apparatus which informed the whole world of its methods of struggle, viz.
, the Soviet government.
This is what primarily alters the position of the Russian workers and peasants in comparison wirth the rule of the proletariat of Paris.
They .
had no apparatus, the country did not understand them; we were able immediately to rely on the Soviet government, and that is why we never doubted that the Soviet government enjoyed the sympathy and the warmest and most devoted support of the overwhelming majority of the masses, and that, for that reason, the Soviet govern­ ment was invincible.
Those who were sceptical of the Soviet government and fre­ quently, ·either consciously or unconsciously, sold and betrayed it for co1npromise with the capifalists ·arid the 'imperialists, raised a deafening clamour about the rule of the proletariat alone not being able to maintain itself i:n Russia.
As if any Bolshevik, or any ad­ herent of the Bolsheviks, forgot for a moment that in Russia only a· government ·that managed to· organise the working class and the majority of the peasantry, all the toiling and exploited classes, in a single, inseparably inter-connected force fighting against the · landlords and the bourgeoisie, could remain in power for -any length of time.
We never doubted· that only the ·alliance of the workers and th-e poorest peasants, the semi-proletarians mentioned in our Party programme, could, in Russia, embrace the majority of-the popula­ tion and ensure firm support for the government.
And after Novem­ ber 7 [October 25] we were able immediately, in the course· of several weeks, to overcome all difficulties and establish a govern­ ment on the basis of this firm alliance.
Yes, comrades! When the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, in its old form-when the peasants did not yet understand who in this party were real advocates of socialism-put forward the slogan of equal land tenure without caring who was to carry out this slogan­ in alliance with the bourgeoisie or-not-we said that it was a fraud.
· with it, which has realised th-at it is a bubble,-claimed that it could introduce equal land tenure in alliance with the bourgeoisie; that : was the fraud they perpetrated.
And when, in the greatest moment in the life of the nation, the Russian revolution presented an ex--ample of collaboration between the toiling masses and the bour­ geoisie, when the war was ruining the people and dooming millions to death from starvation, and when its consequences showed what compromise means in practice, when the Soviets themselves ex­ perienced this and felt it after having passed through the school of compromise, it became obvious that there was a sound, virile and great socialist core in the teachings of those who wanted to unite the toiling section of ·the peasantry with the great Socialist move­ ment of the workers of the whole world.
And as soon as this question presented itself to the peasantry as a clear and distinct practical question, something happened of which no one had any doubt, as has now been -proved by the peasant Soviets and Congresses: when the time came to introduce socialism in practice, the peasants obtained the opportunity to see clearly these two main political lines, i.
e.
, alliance with the bour­ geoisie, or alliance with the toiling masses; they then realised that the party which expressed the real strivings-and interests-of the peasantry was the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party .
.
.
.
And when we concluded our government alliance with this party, we, from .
the very outset, arranged it so that this alliance rested on the clearest and most obvious principles.
If the peasantry of Russia .
want 'to socialise the land in alliance with the workers who will nationalise the banks and establish workers' control, then they are • o.
ur loyal colleagues, our most loyal and valuable allies.
Comrades, not ·a single Socialist would refuse to admit the· obvious truth that between socialism and capitalism there lies a long, more or less difficult transitional period of the diCtatorship of the proletariat, and that the forms this period will take will be determined to a large extent by whether small proprietorship or big proprietorship, whether petty culture or large-scale culture predominates.
It goes without saying that the transition to socialism in Esthonia, that small country in which the whole population is literate, and which consists of large agricultural enterprises, cannot be the same as the transition to socialism in Russia, which is mainly a petty-bourgeois country.
This must be taken into account.
Every .
intelligent Socialist will agree that socialism cannot be imposed upon the peasantry by force and that we can rely only upon the force of example and on the masses of the peasants assim­ ilating living experience~ How would the peasantry prefer to pass to socialism? This is the prac:tical problem .
which now .
confronts the Russian peasants.
How can they support the Socialist proletariat and begin the transition to socialism? And the peasants have al­ ready started this transitioll[ and we have complete confidence m them.
The alliance we concluded with the Left Socialist-Revolution­ aries is built on a firm basis and is growing stronger and stronger every day.
At first we on the Council of People's Commissars feared that factional struggles would hinder the work; but now, after the experience of two months of joint work, I must sar definitely that on the majority of questions we arrived at unanimots deCisions .
.
.
.
We know that only when experience has shown the peasants the kind of exchange 1 rthere must be between town and country will they themselves, from below, on the basis of their own experi­ ence, establish this exchange.
On the other hand, the experience of the civil war has demonstrated to the representatives of the peas­ antry that there is no other road to socialism except the dictator­ ship of the proletariat and the ruthless suppression of the rule of the exploiters.
Comrades, every time we touch upon this theme, at the present assembly, or ·on the Central Executive Committee, I, from time to time, hear from the Right side of this assembly the exclamation: "Dictator!" Yes, "when we were Socialists" we all recognised the dictatorship of the proletariat; rthey even wrote about it in their programmes, they were angry about the widespread prejudice that it was possible to persuade the population, to prove to it, that the toiling masses ought not to be exploited, that this was sinful and disgraceful, and that, wh~l1 this was done, we would achieve heaven 1 J.

cd; on earth.
No, this utopian prejudice was smashed in theory long ago, and now our task i_s to smash it in practice.
We must not depict socialism as if Messieurs the Socialists will bring it to us on a plate all nicely dressed.
Tha\ will never happen.
Not a single problem of the class struggle has ever been solved in history except by violence.
When violence is exercised by the toil­ ers, by the masses of the exploited against the exploiters-then we are for it .
.
.
and we are not in the least disturbed by the howls of those who consciously or unconsciously side with the bourgeoisie, or who are so frightened, so downtrodden by its rule, that they are flung into consternation at the sight of this unprecedented, acute class· struggle, shed bitter tears, forget all their premises and demand that we perform the impossible, that we Socialists achieve complete victory without fighting against the exploiters and with­ out suppressing their resistance.
As far back as the summer of 1917 Messieurs the exploiters understood that this was "the last fight we must face," and that if the Soviets came into power the last bulwark of the bourgeoisie, their principal instrument for the suppression of the toiling masses would be torn out of their hands.
That is why the October Revolution commenced this systematic and unswerving struggle to compel the exploiters to cease their resistance and to become reconciled to the thought, however difficult that may be for even the best of them, that the rule of the exploiting classes has been abolished forever, that from now on the simple muzhik will give the orders and that they must obey, however un­ pleasant that may be.
This will entail many difficulties, sacrifices and mistakes; this work is new, unprecedented in history and cannot be studied in books.
It goes without saying that this is the greatest and most difficult transition that has ever occurred in history; but there was no other way to make this great transition.
And the fact that a Soviet government has been established in Russia has shown that it is the revoh,itionary masses who are richest of all in revvlutiona:ry experience--when millions come to the assistance of a fow score of Party people-that the masses themselves practically take their exploiter!i by the throat.
That is why civil war has acquired predominance in Russia at the present time.
Against us is advanced the slogan: "Away with civil war!" I heard this shouted by the representatives of the Right of the so-called "Constituent Assembly.
" Away with civil war .
.
.
.
What does that mean? Civil war against whom? Against the Kor· nilovs, Kerenskys and Ryabushinskys who are spending millions to bribe tramps and bureaucrats? Against the saboteurs who, con­ sciously or unconsciously, are accepting these bribes? Undoubtedly, among the latter there are ignorant people who accept these bribes unconsciously, because they cannot imagine how the old bourgeois system can he destroyed and why it should he destroyed and an entirely new, socialist society built up on its ruins.
Undoubtedly there are people like that, but does that alter the position? That is why the representatives of the propertied classes are staking their all, that is why this is the last and decisive battle for them, and they stick at nothing in their efforts to smash the Soviet government.
Does not the whole history of Socialism, and particular· ly of French Socialism, which is-so rich in revolutionary sfriving, show that when the toilers themselves take power in their hands the ruling classes resort to incredible crimes and shooting when it is a matter of protecting their money-hags.
* When these people talk to us about civil war we answer them with ridicule; but when they carry their slogans among the student youth we say-you are deceiving them! The class struggle did not accidentally assume its latest form in which the exploited class takes all the means of government in its hands in order to completely destroy its class enemy, the hour­ .
geoisie, in order to sweep from the land of Russia not only the bureaucrats, hut also the landlords, as the Russian peasants in several gubernias did.
We are told that the sabotage with which the bureaucrats and the landlords met the Council of People's Commissars is an indica­ tion of their unwillingness to assisr socialism;** as if it were not clear that the whole of this gang of capitalists and swindlers, tramps and saboteurs, represent a single gang corrupted by the bourgeoisie and resisting the rule of the toilers.
Of course, those who thought that it was possible to leap convince the majority of the population that socialism could be achieved through the medium of the Constituent Assembly, those who be­ lieved in this bourgeois-democratic fable, can go on quietly believ­ ing it, hut let them not complain if life destroys this fable.
Those who have understood what -class· struggle means, who know what the sabotage organised by the bureaucrats means, know that itis impossible to.
jUIIlp straight into socialism.
Representatives -of the bourgeoisie, capitalists, have remained, who hope to restore their rule and.
who defend their money-hags; tramps have re­ mained, a stratum ·of corrupt people who are absolutely down­ trodden by capitalism and who are unable to rise to the level of the idea of the proletarian struggle.
Office employees, bureaucrats have remained, who believe that it is in the interests· of society to protect the old order.
How can anyone imagine that the victory of socialism can come about except by the complete collapse of these strata, except by the destruction of the Russian· and European bour­ geoisie? Do you think the· Ryahushinskys do not understand their class interests? It is they who are paying the saboteurs not to work for us.
Are they disunited? Are they not operating in conjunction with the French, British and American capitalists in buying up securities? It remains to he seen whether they will get anything out of these transactions.
Will not the heaps of securities they are now buying up turn out to he useless heaps of scrap paper? That is why, comrades, our reply to all the reproaches and ac­ cusations hurled against us of employing terror, dictatorship, civil war, although we are far from having resorted to real terror, be­ cause we are stronger than they-we have the Soviets, it will be sufficient if we nationalise the banks and confiscate their property in order to compel them to submit-our reply to all these charges of instigating civil war is: yes, we have openly proclaimed that which no other government has been able to .
proclaim.
The first government in the world that can afford to speak openly of civil war is the government of the masses of the workers, peasants and soldiers.
Yes, we have started-and we are waging civil war against the exploiters.
The more straightfor~ardly _we say this, the more quickly will this wat conie to an end, the more quickly will all the government is fighting for the real, vital cause of all the toilers.
Co~nrades, I do not think we shall achieve victory in this strug­ gle qmckly, but we are very rich in experience: we have managed to achieve a great deal in the course of two months.
We experienced the attempt of Kerensky to launch an attack against the Soviet gov­ ernment and-the complete collapse of this attempt; .
.
.
we experi­ enced the organisation of the rule of the Ukrainian Kerenskys-the struggle has not yet ended there, but anyone who has watched the struggle, who has heard at least a few truthful reports from the representatives of the Soviet government, will realise that the bour­ geois elements of the Ukrainian Rada are living their last days.
There cannot he the slightest doubt about the victory of the Soviet government, of the Ukrainian People's Republic, over the Ukrainian bourgeois Rada.
''"* .
As for the struggle against Kaledin ""·**-here, indeed, every­ thmg rests on the basis of rthe exploitation of the toilers on the bas~s of the bourgeois dictatorship, that is, if the oppositio~ to the Soviet government has any sort of social basis.
The Peasants' Con­ gress'"**;• has clearly demonstrated that Kaledin's cause is hope­ less; the masses of the toilers are against him.
The experience of the Sov~et gover~m~nt, propaganda by deeds, and the example of the Sovwt orgamsat10ns are having their effect, and Kaledin's in­ ternal strongh~ld in the Don region is collapsing, not so much externally as mternally .
.
That is why, looking at the civil war front in Russia we can · say w~th complete conviction: here the victory of the Sovie~ govern­ ment is complete and absolutely assured.
And, comrades, this vic­ t~ry of the Soviet government is being achieved by the fact that nght from the outset the Soviet government began to realise the a~e-long asp~rations of Socialism, while consis·tently and deter­ mmedly relymg on the masses and considering its duty to be to ro~se t~e most _oppressed and downtr<:idden strata of society to ~ctive life, to raise them to the level of socialist creativeness.
That Is why the old army, the army of the barracks, of the parade ground and .
of the torture of soldiers, has retreated into the limbo of the Permit me to relate an incident that occurred to me.
I was in the train on the Finnish Railway and I overheard a conversation between several Finns and an old woman.
I could not take part in the conversation because I cannot speak Finnish.
But one of the Finns turned to me and said: "Do you know the curious thing this old woman said? She said, 'now there is no need to fear the man with the gun.
I was in the woods one day and I met a man with a gun and instead of taking the firewood I had collected from me, he helped me to collect some more.
'" When I heard that, I said to myself: let the hundreds of news­ papers, no matter what they call themselves-Socialist, near-Social­ ist, etc.
-let hundreds of extremely loud voices shout at us, "dic­ tators,'' "violators," and similar epithets.
We know now that another voice is rising from among the masses; these masses say to them" selves: now we need not be afraid of the man with the gun because he protects the toilers and will he ruthless in suppressing the rule of the exploiters.
This is what the people have realised, and that is why the agitation that simple and uneducated people are carrying on when they relate how the Red Guards are turning their might against the exploiters-that is why this agitation is invincible.
It will spread among millions and tens of millions, and will firmly create that which the French Commune of the nineteenth century began to create, but created for only a very short time because it was wrecked by the bourgeoisie-it will create a socialist Red Army, what we Sociaiists have always striven for, viz.
, the general arming of the people.
It will create new cadres of.
the Red Guard, which will enable us to train the masses of the toilers for the armed struggle.
· Formerly it was said that Russia could not fight because she had no officers; hut we must not forget what these very bourgeois of­ ficers said as they observed the workers :fighting against Kerensky and Kaledin; They said: "The technical equipment of the Red Guards is worthless, hut if these people had a little traii:iing they would have an invincible army.
" Because for the first time in the history of the world struggle elements have penetrated the army 18 guided by the idea of the struggle for the emancipation of the ex­ ploited.
And when the work we have commenced will be completed, the Russian Soviet Republic will be invincible.
Comrades, the road.
which the Soviet government has traversed in regard to the socialist army has also been traversed in regard to another instrument of the ruling classes, a still more subtle, a still more complicated instrument, viz.
, the bourgeois courts, which pre­ tended to maintain order,but which, as a.
matter of fact, were a blind, subtle instrument for the ruthless suppression of the exploited, and an instrument for protecting the interests of the money-bags.
The Soviet government acted as it was commanded to act by all the proletarian revolutions; it immediately threw the old court on the scrap-heap.
Let them cry that we are not reforming the old court but that we immediately threw the old coud on the scrap-heap.
* By that we paved the way for a real people's court, and not so much by the force of repression as by the exa~ple of the masses, the au­ thority of the toilers, without formalities-that is what transforms the court from an instrument of exploitation into an instrument of education on the firm foundations of socialist society.
There is no doubt whatever that we cannot attain such a society all at once.
These, then, are the main ,steps the Soviet government has taken along the road indicated by the experience of all the great people's revolutions throughout the world.
There has not been a single revolution in which the masses of the toilers did not take some steps along this road in order to set up a new state.
Unfortunately, they only began to do this, but were not able to finish, they were not able to create the new type of state.
We have created it-we have already established a Socialist Republic of Soviets.
I have no illusions about the fact that we have only just entered the period of transition to socialism, that we have not yet reached socialism.
But if you say that our state is a Socialist Republic of Soviets, you will be right.
You will be as right as those who say that many Western bourgeois republics are democratic republics although everybody knows that not one of even the most democratic of these republics is completely democratic.
They grant scraps of democracy, they cut off tiny bits of the rights of the exploiters, but the toiling masses are as much oppressed as they are everywhere else.
Nevertheless, we say that the bourgeois system is represen:ed by the old monarchies as well as by the constitutional republics.
And so in our case now.
We are very far from having completed even the transitional period from capitalism to socialisU:.
~e h~ve never consoled ourselves with the hope that we could fimsh it with­ out the aid of the international proletariat.
We never had any illu­ sions on that score, and we know how difficult is the road that leads from capitalism to socialism; but it is our duty to say that o~r Soviet Republic is a socialist republic because we have taken this road and our words will not be empty words.
We have initiated a number of measures to undermine the rule of the capitalists.
We know that the activities of all _our i?st~tutions •hould be combined by a single principle, and this prmc1ple we ~xpress in thB' words: "Russia is declared to be a Socialist Republic of Soviets.
" This will be the truth, which rests on what we must do and have already begun to do, this will be the best unification of all our activities, the proclamation of our programme, a call to the toilers and the exploited of all countries who either .
do.
not _know what socialism is, or, what is worse, believe that socialism_ is the Chernov-Tseretelli hodge-podge of bourgeois reforms which we have tasted and tried during the ten months of the revolution and found to be an adulteration, but not socialism.
And that is why "free" England and France did all they pos~ibly could during the ten months of our revolution to prevent a smgle copy of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolu:iona:y newspapers from entering their countries.
They had to act m this way because they saw that the masses of the workers and peasants in all co_untries instinctively understood what the Russian workers were domg.
At every meeting news about the Russian revolution and the ~logan of Soviet government was hailed with loud applause.
The to~lers and the masses of the exploited everywhere have already come mto con­ flict with their party leaders.
The old leaders of Socialism are not yet dead and buried as Chkheidze and Tseretelli are in Russia, but they are already done for in all countries of the world, they are already moribund.
As against the old bourgeois system there now stands a new 18* e~ploited classes, which are breaking down the old bourgeois bar· ners.
New forms of st~te have been i::reated, which make it possible to suppress the exploiters, to crush this insignificant handful who are strong because of yesterday's money-bags and yesterday's store of knowl:dge.
They-the professors, teachers and engineers-trans­ fo~m their _knowledge into an instrument for the exploitation of the to:lers, saymg: I want my knowledge to serve the bourgeoisie, other­ wise I r~fuse to work.
,.
• .
B~t their power has been broken by the ~vorke_rs and peasantl:l revolut10n, and against them is rising a state m whi_ch the _masses themselves freely elect their representatives.
It is precisely at the present time that we can say that we really posse_s~ an organisation of government which clearly indicates the tra?siti~n to the complete abolition of government, of the state.
This_ will be possible when every trace of exploitation has been abohshed, i.
e.
, in socialist society.
~ow I will briefly deal with the measures which the socialist Soviet government of Russia has initiated.
One of the first measures adopted for the purpose, not only of wiping the Russian landlord from th~ ~ace of the earth, but also of eradicating the rule of the bourgeois_ie_ and the ?ossibility of capital oppressing millions and tens of mill~ons of toilers, was the nationalisation of the banks.
The banks are unportant centres of modern capitalist economy.
They collect enormous wealth and distribute it over an enormous area of the country; they are the nerve centres of capitalist life.
They are subtl~ and intricate organisations, which grew up in the course of ~entunes; and against them were hurled the first blows of the ~oviet government which at first encountered desperate resistance m the State Bank.
But this resistance did not deter the Soviet govern­ m:nt.
We succeeded in the main thing, in organising the State Bank· this main thing is in the hands of the workers and peasants.
Afte; ~ese f~ndamental measures, which still require a lot of working out m detail,_ we proceeded to lay our hands on the private banks.
* We d~d not proceed in the way the compromisers would no doubt have advised us to do, viz.
, first wait until the Constituent Assembly was c_onvened, then perhaps __ draft a bill and introduce it in the Constituent Assembly and by that inform Messieurs the bourgeoisie haps draw them into our company, and then make state laws-that would be a "state act.
" .
•• That would have been the annulment of socialism.
We acted quite simply: not fearing the reproaches of the "educated" people, or rather of the uneducated supporters of the bourgeoisie who were trading in the remnants of their knowledge, we said: we have armed workers and peasants at our disposal.
This morning they must occupy all the private banks .
.
.
.
After they have done that, after power is in our hands, only after this, we will discuss what measures to adopt.
In the morning the banks were occupied and in the ~vening the Central Executive Committee issued a decree: "The banks are declared to be national property"-the nationalisation, the socialisa­ tion of banking, its transfer to the Soviet government, took place.
There is not a man among us whq imagines that an intricate and subtle apparatus like banking, which grew out ofthe capitalist system of economy in the course of centuries, could be broken or transformed in a few days.
We never said that it could.
And when scientists, or alleged scientists, shook their heads and prophesied, we said: you can prophesy what you like.
We know only one road for the proletarian revolution, and that is, to occupy the enemy's positions-to learn to rule by experience, from our mistakes.
We do not in the least belittle the difficulties in our path, but we have done the main thing.
The source of the distribution of capitalist wealth has been undermined.
After all this, the annulment of the national debt, throwing off the :financial yoke, was a very easy mat­ ter.
* The confiscation of the factories, after workers' control had been introduced, was also very easy.
When we were accused of breaking up production into separate departments by introducing workers' control, we brushed aside this nonsense.
In introducing workers' control,** we knew that it would take some time before it spread to the whole of Russia, but we wanted to show that we recognise only one road-changes from below; we wanted the work· ers themselves to draw up, from below, the new principles of econ· omic conditions.
Not a ·little time wili be required for this.
· From workers' control we passed on to the creation of a Supreme • 1 !I ! I National Economy.
This measure alone, in conjunction with the nationalisation of the banks and railways which will be carried out within a few days, will enable us to work to build up a new socialist economy.
We know perfectly well the difficulties that confront us in this work; but we assert that only those who set to work to carry out this task and who rely on the experience and the instincts of the masses of the toilers are real Socialists.
The masses will commit many mistakes, but the main thing has been done.
They know that when they appeal to the Soviet government they will get nothing hut support against the ,exploiters.
There was not a single measure intended for the purpose of easing their work that was not wholly and entirely supported by the Soviet government.
The Soviet government does not know everything and cannot deal with every­ thing in time, and very often it is confronted with difficult tasks.
Very often delegations of workers and peasants come to rthe Soviet government and ask what to do with such and such a piece of land, for example.
And frequently I myself have felt embarrassment when I saw that they had no very definite views.
And I said to them: you are the government, do as you please, take all you want, we will support you, but ,take care of production, see that production is useful.
Take up useful work, you will make mistakes, but you will learn.
And the workers have already begun to learn; they have already begun to fight against the saboteurs; People have trans­ formed education into a fence which hinders the advance of the toilers; this fence will be pulled down.
Undoubtedly, the war is corrupting people in the rear and at the front, people who are working on war supplies are being paid far above the rates, all the shirkers who tried to keep out of the war, the tramp and semi-tramp elements who are imbued with but one desire, to "snatch" something and clear out, are being drawn into the war industries.
We are now being blamed for the fact that in many places the workers' government has drawn up measures for the temporary closing down of factories for several weeks and months.
But these elements are the worst that have remained of the old capitalist system and bring with them all the old evils· these we must kick out, remove, and put in the factories all the best' prole­ tarian elements and form them into nuclei of future socialist Russia, have heard these complaints and threats, but we have remamed calm, knowing that now we have a court to which ~e can ~ppeal.
That court is the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers Deputies.
Its word cannot be gainsaid, and we will always rely upon ~t.
_ Capitalism deliberately splits up the workers m order.
to rally an insignificant handful of the upper stratum of the wor~m~ class around the bourgeoisie.
Conflicts with this stratum are mevitable.
We shall not achieve socialism w~thout a struggle.
But we are ready to fight, we have started the fight and we shall b~ing th~s fight before the apparatus that is called the Soviet.
If we bnng this fight before the court of the Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputi~s .
every problem will be easily solved.
For however strong the pnv1leged group of workers may be, when they are brought before the court of the representatives of all the workers, such a court, I repeat, cannot be gainsaid.
This sort of regulation is only just heg_innin~.
The workers and peasants have not yet sufficient confidence m their own strength; owing to age-long tradition they are accustom~d to waiting for orders from above.
They have not yet fully appreciated the fact that the proletariat is the ruling class and that elements have arisen from their ranks who are frightened and downtrodden and who imagine that they must pass through the des~icabl~ s~hool of the bouro·eoisie.
This most despicable of bourgeois pre1ud1ces has remained alive longer than all the rest, but it will die, di~ out com­ pletely.
And we are convinced that with every step the Soviet govern­ ment takes a larger and larger number of people will arise who have completely thrown off the old bourgeois prejudice that simple workers and peasants cannot administer the state.
They can and will learn to do so if they set to work and administer! The organisational task that will confront us is to train ~cade:;s and organisers from the ranks of the masses.
This enormous, g1gant1c · t k is now on the order of the day.
We could not dream of fulfilling as fil .
this task if we did not have the Soviet government, a tenng ap-paratus for promoting people.
.
.
.
Not only have we a state law on control, we have somethmg far more valuable, viz.
, attempts on the part of the proletariat to by which whole branches of industry will be managed by the workers.
Such an agreement is being drawn up, and is almost completed, between the Leather Workers' Union and the All-Russian Leather Manufacturers' Association *; and I attach very special importance to these agreements.
They show that the workers are becoming imbued with the consciousness of their strength.
Comrades, I have not in my report dealt with particularly pain­ ful and difficult questions, such as the.
question of peace and the food supply, because these questions are special items on the agenda and will be discussed separately.
The aim I set myself in making this brief report was to depict in rthe way it appe~rs to me and to the whole of the Council of People's Commissars the history of all that we have experienced during the past two and a half months, the correlation of class forces that has taken place in this new period of the Russian revolu­ tion, how the new state was built up, and what special tasks con­ front it.
Russia has entered the right road tow~rds the achievement of socialism, viz.
, the nationalisation of the banks and the transfer of the land entirely to the masses of the toilers.
We are perfectly well aware ~f the difficultie~ that.
lie ahead; but we are convinced, by comparmg our revolut10n with previous revolutions that we will achieve enormous sucoesses, and that we are on the ~oad that will lead us to complete victory.
And by our side will march the masses of the more advanced countries, whi~h have been disunited by a predatory war, and the ~orkers of which have passed through a longer period of training m democracy.
When people depict the difficulties of our task when we are told that the victory of socialism is possible only on a' world scale, we regard this merely as an attempt, a particularly hopeless ~ttempt, on the part of the bourgeoisie and of its voluntary and mvoluntary adherents to distort the irrefutable truth.
Of course th~ final victory of socialism in a single country is impossible.
Ou; umt o~ workers and peasants which is supporting the Soviet govern, ment is .
only _one of the units of the great world army; which at present is split up by the World War; but it is striving for unitv ,, ment of a report about· our revolution, every name,· with loud and sympathetic cheers, because it knows that in Russia the comn:on cause is being pursued, viz.
, the cause of the revolt of the proletar~at, the international socialist revolution.
A living example, gettmg down to the work in some single country is more effective than manifestoes and conferences; this is what inflames the masses of the toilers in all countries.
The strike of October 1905 *-the first steps of the victorious revolution-immediately spread to Western Europe and then, in 1905, called forth the movement of the Austrian wor~ers.
Already at that time we had a practical illustration of the value of the example of revolution, of the example of action by the w~rke~s in a single country.
Today we see that the socialist revolut10n IS maturing very rapidly in all countries of the world.
Although we make mistakes and blunders and meet obstacles in our path, our example influences them, unites them; they ·say: we shall march together and conquer, come what may.
Marx and Engels, the great founders of socialism, watched the development of the labour movement and the growth of the world socialist revolution for a number of decades and they saw clearly that the transition from capitalism to socialism would be accom· panied by prolonged birth pangs, a long period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the break-up of all that belongs to the old syst~m, the ruthless destruction of all forms of capitalism, the co-operation of the workers of all countries who must combine their efforts in order to ensure final victory.
And they said that at the end of the nineteenth century "the French will commence, and the Germans will finish"~the Fr.
ench will commence, because in the course of decades of revolution they acquired that fearless initiative in revolu­ tionary action that made them the vanguard of the socialist revolu-tion.
Today we see a different combination of the forces of interna· tional Socialism.
We say that it is easier for the movement to start in those countries which are not exploiting countries, which have no opportunities for robbing easily, and are ~ot .
able to bribe the.
u?per stratum of their workers.
The alleged-Sociahst, nearly all mm1ster-plish anything, and they lack firm foundations.
We have seen the example of Italy; during the past ,few days we witnessed the heroic struggle of the Austrian workers against the predatory imperialists.
The pirates may succeed in holding up the movement for a time, but they cannot stop it altogether, it is invincible.
The Soviet Repub­ lic will serve as an example for a long time to come.
Our Socialist Republic of Soviets will stand firmly, li~e a beacon of international Socialism and as an example to all the masses of the toilers.
Over there, there is· fighting, war, bloodshed, the sacrifice of millions of people, capitalist exploitation; here, there is the pursuit of a real peace policy, and the Socialist Republic of Soviets.
Things have turned out differently from what Marx and Engels expected.
History has given us, the Russian toiling and exploited classes, the honourable role of vanguard of the international social­ ist revolution; and itoday we see clearly how far the development of the revolution will go.
The Russians commenced; the Germans, the French and the English will finish, and socialism will be victorious.

· WAR AND PEACE Report Delivered to the Seventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), March 7, 1918* A POLITICAL report might consist of an enumeration of the measures taken by the Central Committee; but what is urgently needed at the present time is not such a report, but an outline of our revolution_ as a whole.
Only a report of this kind can serve as a truly Marx~an basis for all our decisions.
We must review the whole precedrng course of development of the revolution and ascertain why the course of its further development has changed.
Changes have oc­ curred in our revolution that will have enormous significance for the international revolution.
I refer to the October Revolution.
The first successes .
of the February Revolution were due to the fact that the proletariat was followed, not only by the masses of the rural population, but also by the bourgeoisie.
Hence ithe easy victory over tsarism, which we failed to achieve in 1905.
The unprompted, spontaneous creation of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies in the February Revolution was a repetition of the experience of 1905-we had to proclaim the principle of Soviet government.
The masses learned the tasks of the revolution from rtheir own experience of the struggle.
The.
events of May 3-4 [April 20-21] were a peculiar combination of demonstrations and of something in the nature of armed rebellion.
** This was enough to cause the fall of rthe bour­ geois government.
A long period of compromise commenced, t~e logical consequence of the very nature of the petty-bourgeois government which had come into power.
The J~ly events *H' could not yet achieve the dictatorship of the proletariat-the ma~ses were not yet prepared for it.
That is why not one of the respo~s1~le organisations called upon them to establish it.
But as a reconno1trrng operation in the enemy's camp, the July events were of enormous 283 and subsequent events served as practical lessons and made possible the October victory.
The mis­ take committed by those who even in October desired to divide power was that they did not con~ect the October victory with the July days, with the offensive,** with Kornilov, etc.
, etc.
which caused the vast masses to realise that the Soviet government had become inevitable.
Then followed our triumphal procession through­ out Russia, accompanied by the universal desire for peace.
We know that we would not have achieved peace by a one-sided withdrawal from the war.
We pointed to this even at the April Conference.
1 In the period from May [April] to November [October], the sol­ diers clearly realised that the policy of compromise was prolonging the war and was leading to the wild and senseless attempts of the imperialists to start an offensive and to get still more entangled in a war that would last for years.
That was the reason why it was necessary at all costs to adopt as quickly as possible an active policy of peace, why it was necessary to establish the Soviet govern­ ment, and utterly abolish landlordism.
You know that the latter was maintained not only by Kerensky but also by Avksentyev 2 who even went so far as to order the arrest of the members of the Land Committees.
This policy, the slogan of "Power to the Soviets," which we instilled into the minds of the broad masses of the people, en­ abled us, in October, to achieve victory so easily in St.
Petersburg, and transformed the last months of the Russian revolution into one continuous triumphal procession.
Civil war became a fact.
The thing we foretold in the beginning of the revolution, and even in the beginning of the war, and which considerable sections of Socialist circles treated sceptically and even with ridicule, viz.
, the transformation of the imperialist war into civil war, actually took place on November 7 [October 25], 1917, in one of the largest and most backward of the belligerent countries.
In this civil war the overwhelming majority of the popu· .

on our side, and that is why victory was achieved with such extraordinary ease.
_ The troops who abandoned the front carried w~th t~em wherever they went tlie maximum of revolutionary determmat10n to put ~n end to compromise; and the compromising elements, the White Guards, the sons of the landlords, were found to have lost all sup­ port among the population.
Gradually, as the broad ~asses of the people and of the military units that were sent agamst us c~me over to the side of the Bolsheviks, this war became transformed .
m~o a victorious triumphal procession of ~he revolution.
We saw this rn Petrograd, on the Gatchina front,1 where the Cossac~s, whom Ker­ ensky and Krasnov tried to lead against the Red .
capitals, w~vered, we saw this later in Moscow, in Orenburg and m the Ukrame.
A wave of civil war swept over the whole of Russia: and everywhere we achieved victory with extraordinary ease precisely because the fruit had ripened, because the masses had already gone through the experience of compromise with the bourgeoisie.
The slog~n ":All Power to the Soviets," which the masses had tested by long h1stoncal experience, had become part of their flesh and blood.
That is why in the first months after November 7 [October 25], t.
t iumphal proces-1917, the Russian revolution was a con muous r .
~.
sion.
As a result of this continuous triumphal process10n the d1f· ficulties which the socialist revolution immediately enco~ntered, and could not but encounter, were forgotten, were pushed mto t~e background.
One of the fundamental differences between ~ourgeo1s revolution and socialist revolution is that for the b?urgeo1s .
rev?lu­ tion, which arises out of feudalism, new economic org~msations gradually are created iµ the womb of the old order, .
which gr~d­ ually change all aspects of feudal society.
Bourgeois revolut10n was confronted by only one task, viz.
, to sweep.
awa~, to destroy all the fetters of the preceding society.
By fulfilling this task every bourgeois revolution fulfills all that is required of it; it accelerates the growth of capitalism.
The socialist revolution is in an altogether different position .
The more backward the country which, owing to the zigzags of t See note to p.
272.
*-Ed.
history, had to start the socialist revolution, the more difficult is it for it to pass from the old capitalist relations to socialist relations.
To the ~asks of d:str_uction, new ta~ks are added, incredibly difficult tasks, viz.
, o~gamsat10nal tasks.
Had not the popular creative spirit of ~he Russian revolution, which had gone through the great ex­ penence of 1905, given rise to the Soviets as early as March TFeb­ ruary] 1917, they could not under any circumstances have captured power.
in November [October], because success depended entirely on the existence of ready-made organisational forms of a movement em­ bracing millions.
These ready-made forms were the Soviets and that .
is why those brilliant successes, that continuous triumphal pro­ cess10n that .
W.
e had, awaited us in the political sphere; the new forms of political power were already available and all we had to do ~as, by passing a few decrees, to transform the power of the Sovrnts from the embryonic state in which it was in the first months of the revolution into a legally recognised form which has become established as the Russian state, i.
e.
, the Russian Soviet Republic.
It was born at one stroke; it was born so easily because in March [February] 1917 the masses created the Soviets even before any party had manage~ to proclaim this slogan.
It was the creative spirit of the people, which had passed through the hitter experience of 1905 and had been made wise by it, that gave rise to this form of proletarian power.
The task of achieving victory over the internal enemy was an extremely easy one.
The task of creating the political power was an extremely easy one because the masses had created the skeleton of this new po'fer.
The Republic of Soviets was born at one stroke.
But two exceedingly difficult tasks remained the fulfilme.
nt of which could not possibly be the triumphal proce~sion we had m the first months of our revolution-we had no doubt what­ ever that the socialist revolution would be later confronted with enormously difficult tasks.
.
First, there were the tasks of internal organisation which con­ front e_very socialist revolution.
The difference between socialist revolut10n and bourgeois revolution lies precisely in the fact that the.
latter has .
ready at hand the forms of capitalist relationships, while the SoVIet power-the proletarian power~does not inherit ready-made relationships, if· we leave out of account the most de-veloped forms of capitalism which, strictly speaking, affected only a small stn1tum of industry and hardly touched agriculture.
The organisation of accounting, of the control of large enter.
prises, the transformation of the whole of the state economic mechanism into a single, huge machine, into an economic organism that will work in such a way as to enable hundreds of millions of people to be guided by a single plan-such was the enormous organisational task that rested on our shoulders.
Under the present conditions of labour, this task could not possibly be carried out by the "hurrah" methods by which we were able to fulfil the tasks of the civil war.
The very nature of the task prevented a solution by these methods.
We achieved an easy victory over our Kaledinites and created the Soviet Republic in the face of a resistance that was not even worth serious consideration; such a course of events was predetermined by the whole of the preceding objective development; all we had to do was to say the last word and to change the signboard, i.
e.
, to take down the sign: "The Soviet exists as a trade union organisation," and put up instead the sign: "The Soviet is the sole form of state power.
" But the situation was altogether different in regard to organisational tasks.
In this we encountered enormous difficulties.
It immediately became clear to everyone who cared to ponder over the tasks of our revolution that only by long and severe self-disci­ pline would it be possible to combat the disintegration that the war had caused in capitalist society, that only by extraordinarily long and persisl;ent efforts could we overcome this disintegration and conquer those growing elements of it which regarded the revolution as a means of discarding the old fetters and of getting as much for themselves as they possibly could.
The appearance of a large num­ ber of such elements was inevitable in a petty-bourgeois country at a time of incredible ruin, and the fight against these elements that is ahead of us will be a hundred times more difficult, it will be a fight that promises no striking positions, and we have only just started this fight.
We are only at the first stage of this struggle.
Severe trials await us.
The objective situation precludes any idea of limiting ourselves to triumphal processions with flying banners such as we had in fighting against the Kaledinites.
Anyone who attempted to apply these methods of struggle to the organisational tasks that to be utterly bankrupt as a politician, as .
a Socialist, as an active worker in the socialist revolution.
· ! And the same fate awaited several of our young comrades who' were carried away by the first triumphal processions of the revolu­ tion, when the second enormous difficulty confronting the revolu­ tion arose, viz.
, the international question.
The reason we achieved such an easy victory over Kerensky's gangs, why we so easily set up our government and without the slightest difficulty passed the decrees on the socialisation of the land and on workers' control of 1 industry, the reason we achieved all this so easily was that a for­ tunate combination of circumstances protected us for a short time from international imperialism.
International imperialism, with its mighty capital, its highly organised military technique, which is a real force, a real fortress of international capital, could not under any circumstances, on any condition, live side by side with the Soviet Republic because of its objective position and because of the econ­ omic interests .
of the capitalist class which are embodied in it-it could not because of commercial connections and international fin­ ancial relations.
In this sphere a conflict is inevitable.
Here lies the greatest difficulty of the Russian revolution, its great historical problem, viz.
, the necessity of solving international problems, the necessity of calling forth an international revolution, of traversing the path from our strictly national revolution to the world revolution.
This task confronts us with all its incredible difficulties.
I repeat, many of our young friends who regard themselves as Lefts have begun to forget the most important thing, viz.
, why in the course of the weeks and months of the great triumph after October we were able so easily to pass from triumph to triumph.
And yet this was only due to the fact that a special combination of international cir­ cumstances temporarily protected us from imperialism.
It had other things to think about besides us.
And it seemed to us that we too had other things to think about besides imperialism.
Individual imperial­ ists had no time to ·bother with us, because the whole of the great social, political and military might of contemporary world imperial­ ism was torn by internecine war into two groups.
The imperialist pirates who were involved iii this struggle had gone to such lengths, were at such death grips with each other, that neither of these groups was able to concentrate serious forces against the Russian revolu­ tion.
It is paradoxical, but it is true, that our revolution broke out in October, at such a fortunate moment, when unprecedented disaster was afflicting the overwhelming majority of the imperialist c_oun­ tries in the form of the destruction of millions of human bemgs, when the war was exhausting the nations by unprecedented disasters, when in the fourth year of the war the belligerent countries had reached an impasse, had reached the crossroads, when the objective question arose: can the nations which have been reduced to sue? a state continue to fight? It was only the fact that our revolut10n broke out at this fortunate moment, when neither of the two o-icrantic groups of pirates was able immediately to fling itself on ~h: other, or combine against us, it was only this situation in international political and economic relations that enable_d ou.
r revolution to take advantage of the situation and march rn this brilliant triumphal procession in European Rus:::ia, to sp~ead t_o Finland and begin the conquest of the Caucasus and Rumama.
This alone explains the appearance in the leading circles of our Party of Party workers, intellectual super-men, who allowed the~selves to be carried away by these triumphal processions and who said: we can easily smash international imperialism; over there, there will also be triumphal processions, over there, there will be no real dif­ ficulties.
The whole thing is explained by the divergence in the objective position of the Russian revolution which only temporarily took advantage of the difficulties of international imperialism;.
the engine that was moving against us temporarily got stuck, like a railway engine, rushing along towards a small wheel-barrow on the rails which it would smash into splinters if it reached it, suddenly gets stuck-and the engine got stuck because two groups of pirates were in conflict.
Here and there the revolutionary movement grew, but in all the imperialist countries without exception it was still mostly in the initial stage.
Its rate of development was entirely dif­ ferent from that in our country.
Anyone who has carefully thought over the economic prerequisites of the socialist revolution in Europe cannot but be clear on the point that in Europe it will be immeasur­ ably more difficult to start, whereas it was immeasurably easier for 19 tion than it will be over there.
This objective situation caused us to experience an extraordinarily diffipult, sharp turn in history.
From the continuous triumphal procession on our internal front, against our counter-revolution, against the enemies of the Soviet government in October, November and December, we had to pass to collisions with real international imperialism, in its real hostility towards us.
From the period of triumphal ·processions we had to pass to the period of an extraordinarily difficult and severe position, which could not be brushed aside with words, with brilliant slogans­ however pleasant that would have been-because in our disturbed country we had incredibly weary masses who had reached a state in which they could not possibly go on fighting; they had been so utterly broken up by three years of agonising war that they were rendered utterly useless from a military point of view.
Even before the October Revolution we saw representatives of the masses of the soldiers, not members of the Bolshevik Party, who did not fear to tell the whole bourgeoisie the truth that the Russian· army refused to fight.
This state of the army gave rise to a gigantic crisis.
A small-peasant country, disorganised by war, reduced to an incredi­ ble state and placed in an extremely difficult condition; we have no army, but we have to continue to live side by side with a pirate armed to the teeth, a pirate who has remained and will remain a pirate and, of course, cannot be moved by agitation in favour of peace without annexations and indemnities.
A tame and domesticated animal lay side by side with a tiger and tried to persuade it to con­ clude a peace without annexations and indemnities, whereas such a peace could only be attained by attacking the tiger.
The upper stratum of our Party-intellectuals and a section of the workers' organisations-tried to brush this prospect aside primarily with phrases and excuses, such as: it must not be like that.
This peace was too horrible a prospect; to think that we, who up to now have marched in open battle with flying colours and stormed the enemy's positions with "hurrahs," should now yield and adopt these hu­ miliating terms.
Never! We are proud revolutionaries, we declare above all: "The Germans cannot attack.
" This was the first excuse-with which these people consoled them-position· in the midst of organisational work of extraordmary dif­ ficulty .
:Ve shall have to suffer a number of.
huU:iliating defeats.
Of course if we take the position on a world h1stoncal scale, there can be no 'doubt that if our revolution remains alone, if there are no revolutionary movements in other countries, our.
position wil.
l be hopeless.
When the Bolshevik Party alone took this ~atter entirely into its own hands we were convinced that the revolut10n was matur­ ing in all countries and that in the end-but not in the beginning­ no matter what difficulties we experienced, no matter what defeats were in store for us, the international socialist rev~l~tio~ wo.
uld come-because it is coming; would ripen-because it Is npenmg.
I repeat, our salvation from all these difficulties is an all•Europ~an revolution.
Taking this absolutely abstract truth as our starti~g point, and being guided by it, we must see to it tha~ i~ ~oes not m time become a phrase, because every abstract truth, if it is accep:ed without analysis, becomes a phrase.
If you say that every ~tnke bears within itself the hydra of revolution, and he who_ fails to understand this is no Socialist, you are right.
Yes, every stnke b~ars within itself the socialist revolution.
But if you say that every g1v~n strike is an immediate step towards the socialist revolution, you will be uttering empty phrases.
We have heard these phrases.
"every blessed time on this very same spot" so often that we are sick and f d f them and the workers have rejected these anarchist phrases.

·1 lf Undoubtedly, clear as it is that every strike contams wit m 1 ~e the hydra of socialist revolution, it is equ.

clear that the assertl?n that every strike can develop into revolut10n is utter nons~nse.
~lnle it is indisputable that all the difficulties of our revolut10n will be overcome only when the world socialist revolution matures, and it is maturing everywhere--it is absolutely absurd to de~lare that we must conceal every concrete difficulty of our revolut10n today nd say: "I stake everything on the international socialist move-a l I 1 " "L.

from Western 19* few months, whereas scores of years are required for its triumph in Western Europe.
Thus, applying the old method of solving the prob· lem of the struggle by triumphal processions to the new historical period which has set in, and which has confronted us not with a r~tten little Kerensky and a Kornilov, hut with an futernational ?irate-~he i~perialism of Germany, where the revolution is ripen­ mg hut Is obv10usly not quite ripe-is a useless gamble.
The asser­ tion that the enemy would not dare attack the revolution was such a gamble.
The situation at the time of the Brest-Litovsk negotiations wa.
s n?t yet such as to compel us to adopt any peace terms.
The objective correlation of forces was such that obtaining a respite was not enough.
The Brest-Litovsk negotiations had to show that the G~rmans w~uld atta~k, that German society was not so pregnant with revolut10n that it could give birth to it at once, and we cannot blame the German imperialists for not having by their conduct pre· pared for the outbreak, or, as our young friends who regard them­ selves as Lefts say, for the position in which the Germans could not attack.
When we tell them that we have no army, that we were com­ pelled to demobilise-we were compelled to do so, although we did not forget that a tiger was lying beside our tame, domestic aninial­ they.

Although we were compelled to de­ mob1~1se w~ d~d n?t f~rget that it was impossible to stop the war by one side sticking Its bayonet in the ground.

not a smgle organisation in our Party opposed this de­ mob1hsation? Have we gone mad? Not in the least Offi t B lsh .

After October this became obvious to everybody who was willmg to .
see the facts, willing to see the unpleasant, bitter reality and not hide, or pull his cap over his eyes, and make shift with proud phr~ses.
We ha~e.
no.
army, we cannot hold it.
The best thing we can do Is to demobilise 1t as quickly as possible.
This is the sick ~art.
of the organism, which has suffered incredible torture and mu­ tilati~n as the result of tne privations of war, into which it entered techmcally unprepared, and from which it has emerged in such a hundreds of resolutions we have said quite frankly, we said it even in the first period of the Russian revolution: "We are drowning in blood, we cannot go on fighting.
" We could have postponed the end of the war artificially, we could have committed the frauds Kerensky committed, 1 we could have postponed the end for a few weeks, but objective reality forced a path for itself.
This is the sick part of the Russian body politic, which can no longer bear the burden of this war.
The quicker-we demobilise it the quicker will it become ab­ sorbed among those parts that are not so sick and the quicker will the country he prepared for new, severe trials.
That is what we felt when we unanimously, without the slightest protest, adopted the decision-which was absurd from the point of view of foreign events-to demobilise the army.
It was the proper step to take.
We said that it was a frivolous illusion to believe that we could hold the army.
The more quickly we demobilise the army, the more quickly will the social organism as a whole recover.
That is why the revolu­ tionary phrase: "The Germans cannot attack," from which followed the other phrase: "We can declare the state of war at an end.
Neither war nor the signing of peace," was such a profound mistake, such a hitter overestimation of events.
But suppose the Germans do at­ tack? "No, they cannot attack.
" Have you the right to stake, not the fate of the international revolution, but the concrete quesion: will you not be accomplices of German imperialism at the decisive mo­ ment? But we, who since October 1917 have become defencists, who have recognised the principle of defence of the fadierland, we all know that we have broken with imperialism, not in words but in deeds: we destroyed the secret treaties, vanquished the bour­ geoisie in our own country and proposed an open honourable peace so that all the nations might see what our intentions are.
How can people who seriously accept the point of view of defending the Soviet Republic agree to a gamble which has already brought forth bitter fruit? And this is a fact, because the severe crisis which our Party is now experiencing owi:n.

The· guarantee that we will not break our neck on this question lies in the fact that instead of applying the old method of settling factional disagreements, the old method of issuing an enormous quantity of literature, of discussions and plenty of splits, instead of this old method, events have brought our people a new method of learning things.
This method is testing ·everything with facts, with events, with the lessons of world history.
You say that the Germans cannot attack.
The logic of your tactics is that we can declare the state of war to be at an end.
History taught you a lesson, it dispersed this illusion.
Yes, the German revolution is growing, but not as fast as we would like it, not as fast as Russian intelleotuals would like it, not at the rate our history developed in Ootober-when we entered any town we liked, proclaimed the Soviet government, and within a few days nine-tenths of the workers came over to our side.
The German revolution has the misfortune of not moving so quickly.
What do you think: must we reckon with the revolution, or must the revolution reckon with us? You would like the revolution to reckon with you.
But history has taught you a lesson.
It is a lesson, beoause it is the absolute truth that without a German revolution we are doomed-perhaps not in Petrograd, not in Moscow, but in Vladi­ vostok, in more remote places to which perhaps we shall have to retreat, and the distance to which is greater than the distance from Petrograd to Moscow.
At all events, under all conceivable vicissi­ tudes, if the German revolution does not come, we are doomed.
Nevertheless, this does noif: i_n the least shake our conviction that we must be able to bear the most difficult position without a fan­ faronade.
The revolution will .
not come as quickly as we expected.
History has proved this, and we must be able to take this as a fact we must he able to reckon with the fact that the world socialist ;evolutio~ cap.

od the truth, viz.
, that if we have no army, and a wild· beast is lying beside us, we will have to sign a burdensome, humiliating peace treaty.
That is inevitable until the birth of the revolution, until your army recovers, until you allow the men to return home.
Until then the invalid will .
not recover.
· And we will not be able to capture the German wild beast by shouting "hur­ rah!"; we will not throw him off as easily as we threw off Kerensky and Kornilov.
This is the lesson that the masses learned without the excuses that those who desire to evade bitter reality try to bring them.
At first a continuous triumphal procession in October and November-then, suddenly, the Russian revolution is defeated within several weeks by the German pirate; the Russian revolution is prepared to adopt the terms of a predatory treaty.
Yes, the turns of history are very sharp.
All such turns affect us severely.
When, in 1907, we signed the incredibly shameful internal treaty with Stolypin, when we were compelled to pass through the pig-sty of the Stolypin Duma and undertook obligations by signing monarchist documents, .
we experienced on a small scale what we are experienc­ ing now.
* At that time, people who belonged to the best vanguard of the revolution said (and they too had not the slightest doubt that they were right), "we are proud revolutionaries, we believe in the Russian ~evolution, we will ~ever .
enter legal Stolypin institutions.
" But you will.
The life of the masses, history; are stronger than your protesta· tions.
If you won't go, history will compel you to do so.
These were very Left people aµd after the first turn in history nothing remained l)f them as a faction but smoke.
** If we managed to remain revolu­ tionaries, managed to work under terrible conditions and emerge from them, we will be able to do so now, because· it is not our capric~, it is objective inevitability created ill an utterly ruined country, ~ecausi;i in spite of OJ.

' I' I,' you told fairy tales to children in which the cock and the cat did not converse in human language they would not be interested.
The same thing happe~s when you tell the people that civil war will break o'ut in Germany and at the same time you promise that instead of a collision with imperialism we will have an inter­ national revolution in the field.
The people will say that you are deceiving them.
By that you are overcoming the difficulties with which history has confronted us only in your minds, in your desires.
It will be a good thing if the German proletariat will be able to at­ tack.
But have you measured, have you discovered the instrume11t with which to determine whether the German revolution will break out on such and such a day? No, you have not, and we have not.
You are staking everything on this card.
If the revolution breaks out, everything is saved.
Of course! But if it does not turn out as we de­ sire, if it takes it into its head not to achieve victory tomorrow­ what then? Then the masses will say ·to you: you behaved like egoists-you staked everything on a .
fortunate turn of events that did not take place, you have proved to be unfit for the situation that actually arose in place of an international revolution, which will inevitably come, but which has not ripened yet.
A period has set in of severe defeats, inflicted by imperialism, armed to the teeth, upon a country which has demobilised its army, which had to demobilise.
The thing I foretold has come to pass: instead of the Brest-Litovsk Peace we have received a much more humiliating peace, and the blame for this rests upon those who re­ fused to accept the former peace.
We knew that through the fault of the army we wern concluding peace with imperialism.
We sat at the same table with Hoffmann 1 and not with Liebknecht-and by that we assisted the German revolution.
But now you are assisting German imperialism, because you have surrendered wealth amount­ ·ing to millions-guns and shells-and anybody who had seen the incredibly painful state of the army could have foretold this.
Every conscientious man who came from the front said that had the Germans made the slightest attack we would have perished inevit­ ably.
We fell a prey to the enemy within a few days.

Having learned this lesson, we shall overcome our split, our crisis, however severe the disease may be, because an immeasurably more reliable ally will come to our assistance, viz.
, the world revolution.
When they talk to us about ratifying this Tilsit Peace, * this in­ credible peace, more humiliating and predatory than the Brest Peace, I say: certainly, yes.
We must do this because we look at things from the point of view of the masses.
Any attempt to apply the tactics of October-November in a single country-this triumphant period of the revolution-to apply them with the aid of our fantasy to the progress of events in the world revolution, is doomed to failure.
\X!hen it is said that respite is a fantasy, when the newspaper called the Kommunist-from the word "Commune," I suppose--when this paper fills column after column in the attempt to refute the respite theory, I say: I have known quite a lot of factional conflicts and splits and so I have a great deal of experience; but I must say that it is clear to me that the disease will not be cured by the old method of factional Party splits, because it will be healed by life first.
Life is marching forward very quickly.
In this respect it is operating mag-__ -­ nificently.
History is driving its locomotive with such speed that before the editors of the Kommunist get out their next number the majority of the workers in Petrograd will have begun to be dis­ appointed in its ideas, because life is showing that respite is a fact.
We are now signing a peace treaty, we have a respite, we are taking advantage of it to defend our fatherland better-because had we been at war we would have had an army fleeing in panic which would have had to be held up, and which our comrades cannot and could not hold up, because war is more powerful than sermons, more powerful than ten thousand arguments.
Since they did not under­ stand the objective situation they could not hold up the army, and .
cannot do so.
This sick army infected the whole organism, and an­ other incredible defeat was inflicted upon us, German imperialism struck another blow at the revolution, a severe bfow, because we frivolously deprived ourselves of machine-guns under the blows of imperialism.
Meanwhile, we shall take advantage of this respite to urge the people to unite, to fight, to say to the Russian workers and _peasants: "Crea,te self-discipline, strict discipline,.
otherwise you will h~ve to lie under the German jackboot as you are lying now, a~ to create an army capable, not of flight, but of withstanding the severest trials.
" It is inevitable, because the German revolution has not yet broken out, and we have no guarantee that it will break out tomorrow.
That is why the respite theory, which is totally rejected in the flood of articles in the Kommunist, is advanced by life itself.
Every­ one can see that the respite is a fact, that everyone is taking ad­ vantage of it.
We believed that we would lose Petro grad in a few days when the advancing German troops were only a few marches away from it, and when our best sailors and the Putilov workers* notwithstanding all their enthusiasm, were isolated, when incredibie chaos and panic broke out, which compelled our troops to flee right up to Gatchina, and when we had cases when positions were re­ captured that had never been lost.
For example, a telegraph opera­ tor arrived at the station, sat down at the apparatus and wired: "No Germans in sight.
We have occupied the station.
" A few hours later I received a telephone communication from the Commissariat of Ways of Communication informing me: "We have occupied the next station.
We are approaching Y amburg.
No Germans in sight.
Telegraph operator at his post.
" That is the kind of thing we had.
This is the real history of the eleven days' war.
It was described to us by sailors and Putilov workers, who ought to be brought to the Con~:s~ of Sov.
iets.
Let them tell the truth.
It is a frightfully bitter, hum1hatmg, pamful truth, but it is a hundred times more useful it is understood by the Russian people.
' I leave it to others to dream about the international revolution in the field, that it will come.
Everything will come in due time· hut for the time being, set to work to create self-discipline, obe;, come what may, so that we can have exemplary order, so that the :vorkers may learn to :fight for at least one hour in twenty-four.
This JS n;i~ch more difficult than writing beautiful fairy tales.
This is the ~os1tion.
today; by that you will help the German revolution, the m.
ternat10nal revolution.
We do not know how many days the respite will las~, ~ut we hav~ g?t it.
~ e must demobilise the army as quickly a~ p~ss1b1e, hec~use it i:;,; a si-ck organ; meanwhile1 we win i+siiist th\:l f children can fail to understand that in an epoch like the present, when a long painful period of emancipa­ tion is setting in, which has only just created and raised the Soviet power three stages of its development-only children can fail to understand that in this case there must be a long, circumspect strug­ gle.
The disgraceful peace treaty is rousing rebellion, but when a comrade from the Kommunist talks about war he appeals to senti­ ment and forgets that the people were "seeing red," were clenching their fists with rage.
What do they 1 say? "A class conscious rev­ olutionary will never stand this, will never submit to such a dis­ grace.
" Their newspaper bears the title Kommunist, but it should bear the title Szlachta 2 because it looks at things from the point of view of· one of the szlachta, who said, dying in a beautiful pose with his sword in his hand: "Peace is disgraceful, war is honour· able.
" They argue from the point of view of the szlachta; I argue from the point of view of the peasant.
If I accept peace when the army is in flight, and cannot hut be in flight without losing thousands of men, I accept it in order to prevent things from getting worse.
Is the treaty shameful? Every serious peasant and worker will say I am right, because they under­ stand that peace is a means of f';athering strength.
History knows the case-I have referred to it more than once-history knows the -case of the liberation of the Germans from Napoleon after the Peace of Tilsit; I deliberately called the peace the Peace of Tilsit altho_ugh we did not agree to the terms that were contained in th~.
t treaty, viz.
, that we give an obligation to lend our troops to assist the victor to conquer other nations--things like that have happened before, and will happen to us if we continue to place our hopes on the international revolution in the field.
Take care that history does not reduce us to this form of military slavery.
Until the socialist revolution is victorious in all countries th.
ere is a danger that the Soviet Republic may be reduced to slavery.
In Tilsit, Napoleon compelled the Germans to accept disgraceful peace terms.
The situ­ ation at that time was that peace was signed several times, The 1 I.

ing the peace treaty, and the present Hoffmann will hunt us for the same reason.
Only we shall take care that he does not catch us soon.
The last war has been a bitter, painful, but serious lesson for the Russian people.
It taught them to organise, to become disciplined, to obey, to create a discipline that will be exemplary discipline.
Learn discipline from the Germans; if we do not, we, as a people, are doomed, we shall live in eternal slavery.
This is the way history has proceeded, and no other way.
History suggests that peace is a respite for another war, war is a method of obtaining a somewhat better or somewhat worse peace.
At Brest the relation of forces corresponded to a peace dictated by the victor, but it was not a humiliating peace.
The relation of forces at Pskov corresponded to a disgraceful, more humiliating peace; and in Petrograd and Moscow, at the next stage, a peace four times more hum,iliating will be dictated to us.
We will not say that the Soviet power is only a form, as our young Moscow friends have said, we will not say that the content can be sacrificed for this or that rev­ olutionary principle.
We will say: let the Russian people understand that they must become disciplined and organised, and then they will he able to withstand all the Tilsit peace treaties.
The whole history of wars for liberation shows that when these wars embraced large masses liberation came very quickly.
We say: since history marches f.
o~ward in this way, we will have to abandon peace for war, and this may happen within the next few days.
Every man must be prepared.
I have not the slightest shadow of doubt that the Germans are preparing near N arva, if it is true that it has not been taken as all the newspapers say; not in Narva, hut near Narva, not in Pskov, hu_t neat ~skov, the Germans are collecting their regular army, their railways, m order, at the next jump, to capture Petrograd.
And this beast c_an jump very wel_l.
He has proved that.
He will jump again.
There is not a shadow of doubt about that.
That is why we must be prepared, we must he able, not to brag, but to take advantage of eve~ a sin~le day of respite, because we can take advantage of one day s respite to evacuate Petrograd, the capture of which will cause incredible suffering to hundreds of thousands of our proletarians.
I say again that I am ready-to sign, and that I consider it my duty order to gain at least a few days in which to evacuate Petrograd, because by this I will alleviate the sufferings of the workers,, who otherwise may fall under the yoke of the Germans; by that I facili­ tate the removal from Petrograd of all the materials, gun powder, etc.
, which we need, because I am a defencist, because I stand for preparing an army even in the most remote rear where our present, demobilised, sick army is recuperating.
We do not know how long the respite will last-we will try to take advantage of the situation.
Perhaps the respite will be a long one, perhaps it will last only a few days.
Anything may happen, no one knows, or can know, because all the big powers are bound, restricted, compelled to fight on several fronts.
Hoffmann's be­ haviour is determined first by the fact that he must smash the Soviet Republic; secondly, that he has to wage war on a number of fronts, and thirdly, that the revolution in Germany is maturing, is growing, and Hoffmann knows this, he cannot, as some assert, take Petrograd and Moscow this very minute.
But he may do so tomorrow, that is -~­ quite possible.
I repeat that at a moment when the army is obviously sick, when we are taking advantage of every moment, come what may, to get at least one day's respite, we say that every serious rev· olutionary who has contacts with the masses and who knows what war is, what the masses are, must discipline the masses, must heal them; must try to rouse them for a new war-every such revolution-ary will admit that we are right, will admit that we were right in signing any disgraceful peace, because it is in the interests of the proletarian revolution and the regeneration of Russia, because it will help to get rid of the sick limb.
As every sensible man will un· derstand, by signing this peace treaty we do not put a stop to our workers' revolution; everyone will understand that by concluding peace with the Germans we do not stop rendering military aid; we are sending arms to the Finns, but not military units which proved to be unfit.
Perhaps we will accept war; perhaps tomorrow we will sur· render even Moscow and then pass to the offensive: if a change takes place in the mood of the people, which change is maturing, for which perhaps much time is required, but which will come, move our army.
against the enemy.
I am compelled to accept the harshest peace terms because I cannot say to myself that this time has arrived.
When !he time of regeneration arrives everyone will realise it, will see that the Russian is no fool; they will see and understand that for the time being we must refrain, that this slogan must be carried through--and this is the main task of our Party Congress and of the Congress of Soviets.
We must learn to work on a new path.
That is much more difficult, hut it is by no means hopeless.
It will not break the Soviet ~ower !f we do not break it ourselves by senseless gambling.
The trme will come when the people will say: we will not permit our­ selves to be tortured any longer.
But this will happen if we do not allow ourselves to be drawn into thfa adventure and are able to work under severe conditions and under the humiliating treaty we signed the other day, because war alone, or a peace treaty alone, cannot s?lve such a historical crisis.
Because of its monarchical organisa­ t10n, the German people was hound in 1807 when it sicrned its Peace of Tilsit after several humiliating peace treaties, whi~h were transformed into respites for new humiliations and new infringe­ ments.
The Soviet organisation of the masses makes· our task easier.
We should have hut one slogan-seriously learn the art of war p~t the ra~lways in order.
To wage a socialist revolutionary wa: without railways would he the most sinister treachery.
We "must create order, and we must create the whole of that energy and the whole of that might which all that is best in the revolution will create.
Take ad~an:age even of an hour's respite if it is given you, in order to mamtam contact with the remote rear and there create new arm!es.
Abandon illusions for which life has punished you and will pumsh !ou more severely in the future.
An epoch of severe defeats is loommg up before us, it has set in, we must be able to reckon with ~t, we m~~t he prepared for persistent work in conditions of illegality, m condit10ns of downright slavery to the Germans; it is no use glossing this over; it is really a Peace of Tilsit.
If we are able to act in this way, then, in spite of defeat, we shall he able to say with ab­ solute certainty-victory will he ours.
SPEECH IN REPLY TO THE DEBATE ON THE REPORT ON WAR AND PEACE Delivered to the Seventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks}, March 8, 1918 COMRADES, permit me first of all to make a few remarks of relatively minor importance; to start from the end.
At the end of his speech, Comrade Bukharin went so far as to compare us with Petlura.
1 If he thinks such a comparison can be made, how can he remain in the same party with us? Is it not a phrase? Of course, i£ the situation had really been as he described it, we would not have been members of the same party.
The very fact that we are together shows that we are nine-tenths in agreement with Bukharin.
It is true that he added a few revolutionary phrases about our wanting to betray the Ukraine,.
I am sure it is not worth discussing such obvious nonsense.
I will revert to Comrade Ryazanov.
Here, too, I want to observe that just as something which happens once in ten years by way of exception merely proves the rule, so he, accidentally, happened to give utter­ ance to a serious phrase.
He said that Lenin is yielding space in order to gain time.
That is almost a philosophical argument.
This time, it is true, Comrade Ryazanov gave utterance to a very seriou!S phrase which contains the whole essence of the case; I want to yield space to the actual victor in order to gain time.
That is the whok point, and the only point.
All the rest is mere talk: need for rev­ olutionary war, rousing the peasantry, etc.
When Comrade Bukha­ rin argues that there can be no two opinions about the possibility of war and says: "Ask any military man'.
' (I wrote down what he said), since he puts the question in that way and suggests that we should ask any military man, then my reply to him is: I have asked "any 1 Leader of the Ukrainian nationalists who, with the aid of the Ger­ mans, overthrew the Soviet government in the Ukraine in 1918 and , set up the government of the so·c·alled Rada.
-Ed.
20 305 and he proved to he a French officer with whom I conversed.
This French officer, looking at me angrily; of cours&­ didn't I sell Russia to the German~?-said: "I am a royalist, I am a supporter of a monarchy even ill France, I stand for the defeat of Germany, don't think that I am a supporter of the Soviet govern­ ment"-how could I think so, seeing that he was a monarchist?­ "hut I was in favour of your signing the treaty at Brest because that was necessary.
" There you have your ''ask any military man.
" A military man had to say what I said: we ought to have signed the treaty at Brest.
And if now it logically follows from Comrade Bu­ kharin's speech that our disagreements have diminished consider­ ably, it is because his friends have concealed the main point of our disagreements.
When Comrade Bukharin now comes forwar"d and roundly abuses us for having demoralised the masses, he is absolutely right, only he is roundly abusing himself, and not us.
Who caused all the mess on the Central Committee? You, Comrade Bukharin.
Truth will prevail, no matter how much noise you make: we in our own com­ radely circle, we at our own congress have nothing to conceal and we must speak the truth.
And the truth is that there were three trends on the Central Committee.
On February 17 Lomov a~d Bukharin abstained from voting.
* I asked that the record of the voting he typed in many copies so that every member of the Party could go to the secretariat if he so desired and see the voting-the historical voting of February 3 [January 21] which shows that they wavered; we did not waver in the least, we said: "We will accept peace at Brest-you will not get a better one-in order to prepare for a rev­ olutionary war.
" We have already gained five days in which to evacuate Petrograd.
Now a manifesto has been issued by Krylenko and Podvoisky, who are not among the L().
fts, and whom Bukharin treated with derision when he said that we are "shovin()" forward" Krylenko, as i£ we had invented what Krylenko report:d.
We ab­ solutely agree; that is exactly the position; the military men con­ firmed what I said, and you put forward the excuse that the Germans will not attack.
Can this situation be compared with October, when it was not a matter of technique? No.
If you want to reckon with facts, then reckon with the fact that our disagreement arose ah out advantageous to do so.
When Comrade BuKharm com~e11c~d h.

very much.
I reply unhes1tatmgl!• it i~ possible-but now we must accept peace: There is no contrad1c· tion here at all.
--After these brief remarks_ I.
will reply in detail to the other speakers.
I must make an exception in regard to Radek.
~ut there was another speech, that by Comrade Uritsky.
What else did he say except "Canossa," ·•· "treachery," "you retreated," "you a~~p:ed yourselves"? What does all this mean? Is not all your cnt1c1sm taken from the Left Socialist-Revolutionary newspaper? Com:ade Bubnov read to us a declaration submitted to the Central Committee by members of the Central Committee who regard themselves as being extremely Left, and who presented a perfect example of what -demonstrating before the whole world means: "The conduct of the Central Committee strikes a blow at the international proletariat.
" Is this not a phrase? "Demonstrate our impotence to the whole world!" How do w~ demonstrate this? By offering to conclude peace? By the fact that the army fled? Have we ~ot proved that by starting war against Germany now, and not acceptmg the Brest !ea~e, we would have demonstrated to the 'ivorld that our army is srck and refuses to go into battle? It is absurd for Comrade Bubnov to assert that we alone caused this wavering.
The wavering was caused by the fact that our army was sick.
We had to give it a respite some time or other.
Had you pursued a correct strategy we would have had a month's respite, but as you pursued a wrong strategy, we had only five days' respite-and even that is good.
The history of war shows t~at s~met~mes e:en a few days are enouah to stop an army that is fleemg m pamc.
Whoever re­ fuses to :ign a diabolical peace now is a man of phrases and not a strategist.
That is the whole trouble.
When members of the Central Committee write to me: "Demonstration of impotence," "treachery," it is the most pernicious, piffii:r% inia~til~ phrase~ mongering.
We demonstrated impotence when we tned to n~ht; when it was impossible to demonstrate, when an attack agamst us was irnwitable.
As for the Pskov peasants, we shall invite 20* are ~reating them, in order to create the mentality with which a soldier who has fallen sick with panic may recover and say: "Yes, n~w I understand that.
t~s is not the war that the Bolsheviks pro­ m1s~d to put a s~op to, it is a new war, which the Germans are waging agamst the Soviet government.
" Then recovery will set in.
But you put a qu~stio~ to us that cannot he answered.
No one knows how long the respite will last.
· Now I z_nust deal with the position taken up by Comrade Trotsky.
'Y'e.
must discern two aspects in his activities: when he started nego.
tia.
ho~s at Brest and ~ade excellent use of them for the purpose of ag1tat10n, we ~ere all m agr_eement with him.
He quoted here a part of a conversat10n he had with me; but I will add that it had been arranged between us that we would hold out until the Germans presented us with an ultimatum and that when the ultimatum was presented, we would yield.
The Germans fooled us: out of the seven days they stole five.
In so far as Trotsky's tactics were directed to­ wards playing for time, they were correct; they became wrong when ~e state of war was declared to be at an end, but peace was not signed.
I very definitely proposed that peace be signed.
We could not get a better peace than the Brest~Litovsk Peace.
It is clear to everyone that we coul~ have obtained a month's respite, that we wou!d not have l?st.
Smee history has proved this, it is not w~rth .
ta!kmg about agam; but it is ridiculous for Bukharin to say: "Life w1_ll prove that we were right.
" I was right, because I wrote about this.
as far back as 1915: "We must prepare to wao-e wa·r 1"t 1· · · bl · · · .
o , s mev-1ta e, it Is commg, it will come.
" 1 But we ought to have accepted peace ~nd not bragged for nothing.
The very fact that war will come made it all the more necessary for us to accept peace· now at all events, we are facilitating the evacuation of Petrogr~d w~ h facilitated it.
~~iS is ~ fact.
When Comrade Trotsky puts 'for~ar~v: new demand: P~om1se not to conclude peace with Vinnichenko," I say: under no circumstances will I give such a pledge.
If the con­ gr~ss g~ve ~uch a pledge, neither I, nor a single one of those who thmk w1tli me would accept any responsibility for it.
It would inean 1 See "A Few Theses" (Th.
esi"s 11) · s z · .
m e ected Works, that instead of having a clear line of manceuvring-retreating when it is possible, sometimes attacking-we would tie our hands again with a formal decision.
In war you must never tie your hands with considerations of forrriality.
It is ridiculous not to know the history of war, not to know that a treaty is a means of gaining strength; I have already referred to the history of Russia.
Some people child­ ishly think that by concluding peace we sold ourselves to the devil, we went to hell.
This is positively ridiculous, because the history of war shows as clearly as clear can be that the signing of a treaty after defeat is a means of gaining strength.
Cases have occurred in history when war followed on war, but we have forgotten all this; we see the old war becoming transformed into .
.
.
.
1 Tie your han,ds with considerations of formality forever· if you like, but then sur· render your responsible posts to the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries.
We will not take responsibility for this.
There is not the slightest shadow of a desire for a split in this.
I am convinced that life will teach you.
March 12 is not very far off, and you will receive a large quantity of material.
* Comrade Trotsky says that this will be treachery in the fullest sense of the word.
I assert that this is a totally wrong point of view.
In order to prove this concretely, I will quote an example: two men are walking together and are attacked by ten men; one fights, the.
other runs away-that is treachery.
But suppose there are two armies, each a hundred thousand strong, and these two armies are opposed by five armies.
One army is surrounded by a force _of two hundred thousand.
The other army ought to come to its assistance, but it knows that a force of three hundred thousand is ranged in such a position that if it advances to the assistance of the first army it will be caught in a trap.
Should it go to the assistance of the other army? No, it should not.
That would not be treachery, it would not be cowardice: the mere increase in numbers changed all concepts, every military man knows that-no personal concepts are involved here.
By acting in this way, I preserved my army.
Let the other army be captured; I will reinforce mine, I have allies, I will wait until these allies join me.
This is the only line of reasoning one can adopt.
t Seyei:al W\ff~S omitted from th!l steno~aphic report.
--Ed • considerations, nothing hut phrases can result.
Politics cannot he conducted in this way; , .
We have done all that could he d~ne.
By signing the peace treaty we saved Petrograd, if only for a few days (don't let the secretaries or the stenographers think of putting this down).
The treaty orders us to withdraw our troops from Finland, the troops are obviously useless, but we are not prohibited from sending arms to Finland.
If Petrograd had fallen a few days ago, there would have been panic in the city and we would not have been able to remove anything; hut during the five days we assisted our Finnish comrades-I will not say how mµch,.
they know that themselves.
The talk about our having betrayed Finland is infantile phrase­ mongering.
We actl,l,ally helped her by retreating from the Germans in time.
Russia will not perish if Petrograd falls, Bukharin is a thousand times right when he says that; but if we manreuvred in the Bukharin way; we would ruin a good revolution.
We have betrayed neither Finland nor the Ukraine.
Not a single class Conscious worker will accuse us of having done that; we are rendering all the assistance we can.
We have not taken a single good man out of the forces and will not do so.
If you say that Hoffmann will catch us, you are right.
0£ course he can, I have no doubt about that; but how many days it will take him to do it he does not know, and nobody knows.
Moreover, your argument that he will catch us is an argument that concerns the political relation of forces about which I will speak later on.
' Having explained why I cannot possibly accept Trotsky's pro­ posal-we cannot conduct politics in this way-I must say that Radek has presented an example of the extent to which the comrades at.
this congress have abandoned phrases, which Uritsky, however, ~till.
adheres to.
I ca~no~, possih~y accuse Radek of phrasemongering m h1~ speech.
He said: There 1s not a shadow of treachery, there is no disgrace, because it is clear that you retreated· in the face of superior military forces.
" This appraisal sma~hes Trotsky's position completely.
When Radek said: "Clenching our teeth, we must pre­ pare ~ur forces," he ~as rig_ht-I subscribe to this entirely: without hrnl$ging, prep~:rn mth clenched teeth.
olutionary ~ar will come, there is no disagreerr:e~t among us ab?ut that.
The disagreement is about the Peace of T1ls1t, should we sign it or not? .
The worst thing of all is that the army is sick, and that is "'hy the Central Committee should have a single firm line ~nd not disagreements, or a middle line, which Comrade Bukharm also supported.
I do not paint the respite in rosy colours.
No one knows how long the respite will last.
I do not ~now.
The e~o:1s made to force me to say how Iona the respite will last are ridiculous.
By keeping possession of th: main railway lines we are helpi~g the Ukraine and Finland.
We are taking advantage of the respite by manreuvring and retreating.
It is no longer possible to tell the German workers that the Russians are capricious, because it is clear now that German· Japanese imperialism is advancing, and this will he clear to every· body.
Besides wanting to strangle the Bolsh.
eviks, the Ger.
man~ want to strangle the West; everything has got mixed up, and m this new war we will have to learn, and we must learn how to manreuvre.
In regard to Comrade Bukharin's speech I want t~ say that when he lacks an anrument he takes something from Untsky and says: "You have bee~ utterly disgraced.
" No argument is required for this: if we have been disgraced, then we ought to have collected our papers and fled; but although we have been disgraced: I d_o not think our positions have been shaken.
Comrade Bukharm tned to analyse the class basis of our positions, but instead of doing·that he told us a story about a deceased Moscow economist.
When they found some connection between our tactics and bagman profiteer­ ing,1 by God, it was ridiculous; they forgot that the attitude of a class as a whole-of a class and not of bagmen-shows that the Rus­ sian bourgeoisie and all its hangers-on-the Dyelo N_aroda-.

THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT* THE INTERNATIONAL PosrTION OF THE RussrAN SovrnT REPUBLIC A-.
"!D THE FUNDAMENTAL TASKS OF THE SOCIALIST REVOLUTION THANKS to the peace which has been achieved-notwithstanding its bu~densome character and its instability-the Russian Soviet Re­ public is enabled for a certain time to concentrate its efforts on the most important and most difficult aspect of.
the socialist revolution, viz.
, the organisational task.
This task was clearly and definitely presented to all the toilers and the oppressed masses in the fourth section £Part 4) of the resolution adopted at the Extraordinary Congress of Soviets in Mos­ cow on March 16, 1918,** in the very section (or part) which speaks of the discipline of the toilers and of the ruthless struggle against chaos and disorganisation.
Of course, the peace achieved by the Russian Soviet Republic i;-; unstable not because it is now thinking of resuming military operations; apart from bourgeois counter-revolutionaries and their henchmen (the Mensheviks and uthers) not a s,ingle sane politician thinks of doing that.
The instability of the peace is due to the fact that in the imperialist states bordering on Russia on the West and the East, which command enormous military forces, the military party, te1i1pted by the momentary weakness of Russia and egged on by capitalists who hate socialism and are eager for plunder, may secure supremacy at any moment.
Under these circumstances the only real, not paper guarantee of peace we have is the antagonism between the imperialist states, which has reached extreme limits, and which manifests itself· on the one hand in the resumption of the imperialist butchery of the peoples in the West, and on the other hand in the extreme intensific cation of the imperialist rivalry between Japan and America for ;:;upremacy in the Pacific and on the Pacific coast, 313 It goes without saying that, protected by such an unreliable guard, our Soviet Socialist Republic is in -an extremely unstable and certainly critical international position.
All efforts must be exerted to the very utmost to take advantage of the respite which has been given us by the combination of circumstances in order that the very severe wounds that the war has inflicted upon the whole of the social organism of Russia may be healed and that the economic revival of the country, without which a real improvement in the power of defence of the country is inconceivable, may be brought about.
It goes Without saying also that we shall be able to render serious assistance to the socialist revolution in the West which has been delayed for a number.
of reasons, only to the ext~nt that we are able to fulfil the organisational task that confronts us.
A fundamental condition for the successful fulfilment of the primary organisational task that confronts us is that the political leaders of the people; i.
e.
, the members of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and all the class conscious representatives of the masses of the toilers, shall fully appreciate the fundamental dif­ ference between previous bourgeois revolutions and the present socialist revolution in this respect.
In bourgeois revolutions, the principal task of the masses of the toilers.
was to fulfil the negative or destructive work of abolishing feu~ahsm, monarchy and medirevalism.
The positive, or creative work of organising the new society was carried out by the property­ owning bourgeois minority of the population.
And the latter carried out this task relatively easily, notwithstanding the resistance of the workers and the poorest peasants, not only because the resistance of the.
masses t~at were exploited by capital was then extremely weak owmg to their scattered character and ignorance, but also because th~ fund~ment.
al organising force of anarchically-constructed capi.
tahst society 1s the spontaneously expanding national and inter­ national market.
-In· every so_cialist revolution-and consequently in the socialist revolution in .
Ru.
ssia which we started on November 7 [October 25], 1917-th~ prmc1pal task of t~ proletariat,· and of the poorest peas-11ntry which it leads, is thi:i of the goods required for the existence of tens of millions of people.
Such a revolution can be successfully carried out only if the major­ ity of the population, and primarily the majority of the toilers, display independent historical creative spirit.
Only if the proletar­ iat and the poorest peasantry display sufficient class consciousness, devotion to ideals, self-sacrifice and perseverance will the victory of the socialist revolution be assured.
By creating a new Soviet type of state, which gives the opportunity to all the toilers and the masses of the oppressed fo take an active part in the independent building up of a new society, we solved only a small part of this difficult problem.
The principal difficulty lies in the economic sphere, viz.
, the introduction of the strict and universal accounting and control of the production and distribution of goods, raising the productiv­ ity of labour and socialising production ~n actual practice.
* * * The development of the Bolshevik Party, which today is the gov­ erning party in Russia, very strikingly indicates the nature of the historical change we are now passing through, which represents the pe~uliar feature of the present political situation and which calls for a new orientation of the Soviet government, i.
e.
, for a new pre­ sentation of new tasks.
The first task of every party of the future is to convince the majority of the people that its programme and tactics are correct.
This task :;;tood in the forefront under tsarism as well as in the period of the Chernovs' and Tseretellis' compromise with the Kerenskys and Kishkins.
This task has now been fulfilled in the main (of course, it is not completely fulfilled, and it can never be completely fulfilled), for, as the recent Congress of Soviets in Moscow 1 in­ controvertibly showed, the majority of the workers and peasants of Russia are obviously on the side of the Bolsheviks.
The -second task that confronted our ·Party was to capture political power and to suppress the resistance ofthe exploiters.

11 ! has this task been fulfilled completely, and it cannot be ignored because the monarchists and Cadets and their henchmen and hang· ers-on, the Mensheviks and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, are continuing their efforts to unite for the purpose of overthrowing the Soviet government.
But in the main the task of suppressing the resistance of the exploiters was fulfilled in the period from Novem· her 7 [October 25], 1917, to (approximately) February 1918, or to the surrender of Bogayevsky.
1 A third task is now coming to the front as the immediate task and one which represents the peculiar feature of the present situa· lion, viz.
, the task of organising the administration of Russia.
Of course, this task arose and we carried it out on the very next day after November 7 [October 25], 1917.
But up to now, while the resistance of the exploiters still took the form of open civil war, the task of administration could not have become the main, the central task.
.
Now it has become the' main and central task.
We, the Bolshevik Party, have convinced Russia.
We have won Russia from the rich for the poor, from the exploiters for the toilers.
Now we must administer Russia.
And the peculiar feature of the present situation, the difficulty, lies in understanding the specifrc character of the transition from the principal task of convincing the people and of suppressing the exploiters by military force to the principal task of administration.
For the first time in history a Socialist party has managed, in main outline, to fulfil the task of winning power and of suppressing the exploiters, and has managed to approach very close to the task of administration.
We must prove worthy executors of this most difficult (and most grateful) task of the socialist revolution.
We must ponder over the fact that in addition to being able to convince people, in addition to being able to conquer in civil war, it is neces­ sary to be able to do practical organisational work in order that the administration may be successful.
It is a very difficult task, because .
it is a matter of organising in a new way the most deep-rooted, the economic foundations of life of tens 11nd tens of millions of people.

(in the principal and main outlines) will it be poss~bl~ to say th.
at Russia has become not only a Soviet, but also a Sociahst Repubhc.
THE GENERAL SLOGAN OF THE MOMENT The objective situation outlined above, which was created by the severe and unstable peace, the terrible state of ruin, the un­ employment and starvation we inherited from the war and the r~le of the bourgeoisie (represented by Kerensky and the Menshev1ks and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries who supported run:), all this inevitably caused extreme weariness and even exhaust10n among the broad masses of the toilers.
These masses imperalively demand­ and cannot but demand-a respite.
The task of restoring the pro­ ductive forces destroyed by the war and the mismanagement of the bourgeoisie comes to the front, viz.
, the healing of the wou~ds inflicted by the war, by the defeats in the war, by the profiteermg of the bourgeoisie and its attempts to restore the rule of the ~x­ ploiters;; the economic revival of the country; the durable -mam­ tenance of elementary order.
It may seem paradoxical, but in view of the objective-conditions enumerated above, it is absolutely certain that at the present moment the Soviet government can ensure the transition tb socialism only if these very elementary and most ele­ mentary problems of maintaining public order can be solved prac­ tically in spite of the opposition of the bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks ~.
nd the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries.
In view of the concrete and specific features of the present situation, and in view of the existence of the Soviet ·government with its land socialisation law, workers' control law, etc.
, the practical solution of these elementary prob­ lems and the overcoming of the organisational difficulties of the first steps towards socialism represent two sides of the same medal.
Introduce accurate and conscientious accounting -of money, man­ age economically, do not be lazy, do not steal, observe the strictest discipline during work-it is precisely such slogans, which were justly scorned by the revolutionary proletariat when the bourgeoisie concealed its rule as an exploiting class by these commandments, that now, after the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, are becoming .

Clearly is an immeasurably higher one than the· pr d" revolutions we will find that at the present momeut we are approxi­ mately at the level reached in 1793 and 1871.
* We can he legitimat~ ly proud of having risen to this level, and i_n one respect we have certain! y advanced somewhat further, namely : w_e have decreed and introduced in the whole of Russia the highest type of state-the Soviet state.
But under no circumstances can we rest content .
-with what we have achieved, because we have only just started the transi­ tion to socialism, we have not yet done the most dec:isive thing in this respect.
_ .
The most decisive thing is the organisation of the strictest and nation-wide accounting and control of production and of the distri­ bution of goods.
And yet, we have not yet introduced accounting and control in those enterprises and in those branches and sides of economy which we have confiscated from the bourgeoisie; and without this there can be no thought of creating the second and equally important material condition for the introduction of social· ism, viz.
, increasing the productivity of labour on a national scale.
That is why the task of the present moment could not be defined in the simple formula: continue .
the offensive against capital.
Although we have certainly not utterly routed capital and although it is certainly necessary to continue the offensive against this enemy of the toilers, such a definition would be inexact, would not be con­ crete, would not take into account the peculiar feature of the present situation in which, in order that the future offensive may be success­ ful, it is necessary to "halt" the offensive for the time being.
This can be explained by comparing our position in the war against capital with the position of a victorious army that has cap­ tured, say, a half or two-thirds of the enemy's territory and is com­ pelled to halt in order to collect its forces, to replenish its supplies of munitions, repair and reinforce the lines of communication, build up new bases, call up new reserves, etc.
The cessation of the offensive of a victorious army under such conditions is necessary precisely in order that the remaining part of the enemy's territory may be won, i.
e.
, in order that complete victory may be achieved.
Those who have failed to understand that the objective state of affairs at the present capital have failed to understand_anything at all about the present political situation.
It goes without saying that we can speak about the "cessation" of the offensive 'against capital only in quotati~XJ.
marks, i.
e.
, only metaphorically.
In ordinary war, a general order can be issued-to stop the offensive; the advance can actually be stopped.
In the war against capital, however, the advance cannot be stopped, and there can be no thought of our abandoning the further expropriation of capital.
What we are discussing is the shifting of the centre of gravitJ' of our economic and political work.
Up to now measures for the direct expropriation of the exprop~ia­ tors were in the forefront.
Now the organisation of accounting and control in those branches of economy in which the capitalists have already been expropriated, and in all other branches of economy, is in the forefront.
If we continued to expropriate capital at the same rate at which we have been doing _up to now, we would certainly suffer defeat, because our work of organising proletarian accounting and control has obviously-:--obviously to every thinking person-lagged behind t_he work of directly "expropriating the expropriators.
" If we now concentrate all our efforts on· the organisation of accounting and control, we shall be able to solve this problem, we shall be able to make u~ for lost time, we shall win our "campaign" against capital.
.
But is not the admission that it is necessary to make up for lost time tantamount to admitting that we have committed an error? Not in t~e least.
We will again quote our military example.
If it is possible to defeat and push back the enemy merely with detach­ ments of light cavalry, it should be done.
But if this can be done successfully only up to a certain limit, then it is quite conceivable that when th.
is limit has been-reached, it will be necessary to call ~p heavy.
artil.
lery.
I:1 admitting that it is now necessary to make up for lost time, ui callmg up heavy artillery, we do not admit that the successful cavalry attack was a mistake.
Frequently, the lackeys of the bourgeoisie reproach us for having ~a~nched a "Red Guard" attack on capital.
The reproach is absurd: Jt is worthy of the lackeys of the money-bags, because at one 'time the "Red Guard" attack on capital was absolutely dictated by cir-( Gegechkori i~ putting -up such resistance even_ now) ,· Duto_v.
and Bogayevsky.
Military resistance cannot be broken except by ~mh:ary means and the Red Guards fought in the noble and great h1stoncal cause 'of emancipating the -toilers and the exploited from the yoke of the exploiters.
.
.
Secondly, we could not at that_time put th; method of a.
drrunis-tration in the forefront in place ot the methoas of suppress10n,.
b~­ cause the art of administration is not an art that one is born t~, it is acquired by experience.
At that time we lacked that exp.
er~enc~; now we have it.
Thirdly, at that time we could not have sp.
eciahsts m the various fields of knowledge and technique at our disposal be­ cause those specialists were either fighting in th.
e_ ranks of the Bogayevskys, or were still able to put up systematic and stubborn passive resistance in the form of sabotage.
Now we have broken the sabotage.
The "Red Guard" attack on capital ~.
as succe~sful, was victorious ·because we vanquished both the nnhtary re.
s1stance of capital a~d the sabotaging resistance of capital.
Does that mean that a "Red Guard" attack on capital is always appropriate, in all circumstances, that we have no other mea~s of fighting capital? It would be childish to think t~at.
We ach1ev~d victory with the aid of light cavalry, but we also nav: heavy artil­ lery.
We achieved victory by methods ~f.
sup~ress10n; we .
can achieve victory also by methods of admm1strat10n.
We must ~e able to change our methods of fighting the enemy in accordance with the changes in the situation.
We will not for a moment cease our "Red Guard" suppression of Messieurs the Savinkovs and -Gegech­ koris and all other landlord and bourgeois counter-revolutionaries.
But we will not be so foolish as to put "Red Guard" methods in the forefront at a time when the epoch when Red Guard attacks were necessary has, in the main, drawn to a close (and to a successful close) , and when the epoch of utilising bourgeois specialists by the proletarian state power for the purpose of reploughing the soil in order to prevent the growth of any bourgeoisie is knocking at the door.
This js a peculiar epoch, or rather stage of development, and 21 order to utterly defeat capital, we must he able to adapt the forms of our struggle to the peculiar conditions of this stage.
Without the guidance of specialists in the various fields of knowledge, technology and experience, the transition to socialism will be impossible, because socialism calls for the class conscious and mass advance to greater productivity of labour compared with capitalism, and on the basis achieved by capitalism.
Socialism must achieve this advance in its own way, bv its own methods-or to speak more concretely, by Soviet ~eth;ds.
And the specialists'.
in View of the environment of the social life which made them special.
ists, are, in the main, bourgeois.
Had our proletariat, after capturing power, quickly solved the problem of accounting, control and organisation on a national scale (which was impossible owing to the war and the backwardness of Russia), we, after breaking the sabotage, would have completely subordinated these bourgeois spe­ cialists to ourselves by means of universal accounting and control.
Owing to the considerable "delay" in introducing accounting and control generally, we, although we have managed to vanquish sabotage, have not yet created the conditions which would place the bourgeois specialists at our disposal.
The vast majority of the saboteurs are "coming into our service," but the best organisers and the biggest specialists can be utilised by the state either in the old way, in the bourgeois way (i.
e.
, for high salaries), or in the new way, in the proletarian way (i.
e.
, by creating the conditions of na­ tional accounting and control from below, which would inevitably and automatically subordinate the specialists and enlist them for our work).
Now we have had to resort to the old bourgeois method and to agree to pay a very high price for the "services" of the biggest hourge?is spe.
cialists.
All those who are familiar with the subject appreciate this, but not all ponder over the significance of the measure that has been adopted by the proletarian state.
Clearly, such a measure is a compromise, a departure from the principles of the Paris Commune* and of every proletarian state, which call for the reduction of all salaries to the level of the wages of the average worker, which call for a struggle against careerism, not offens1~e ~gainst capital (for capital is not a sum of money, but a defi~1te social relation) ; it is also a step backward on the part of o~r social­ ist Soviet government, which from the very outset proclaimed and pursued the policy of reducing high salaries to the level of the wages of the average worker.
Of course, l:he lackeys of the bourgeoisie, particularly the s~all fry, such as the Mensheviks, the Novaya Zhizn-ists an_d the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, will giggle over our confess10n t~at ~e are taking a step backward.
But we can afford to ignore the~r gig· gling.
We must study the peculiar features of_the extrem~ly difficult and new path to socialism without concealmg our nnstakes and weaknesses and we must try in good time to do what has been left undone.
T~ conceal from the masses the fact that the enlistment of bonrgeois specialists by means of extremely high salaries is a retreat from the principles of the Paris Commune would be ta~t~mount to sinking to the level of bourgeois politicians and to ~ece1vmg the masses.
Openly explaining how and why we took this s:ep back­ ward.
and then publicly discussing what means are available ~or maki~g up for lost time, means educating the mas~es and le~n~mg from experience together with the masses how to bu~ld ~p s~ciahs1:i· There is hardly a single victorious military campaign m history m which the victor did not commit certain mistakes, suffer temporary defeat and temporarily retreat in some things an~ in so~e ~lace~.
The "campaign" which we have undertaken ~gamst c~~1tahsm is a million times more difficult than the most difficult nnhtary cam-paio-n and it will be silly and disgraceful to fall into despondency ;:i ' because of a single and partial retreat.
We will now discuss the question from the practical point of view.
Let us suppose that the Russian Soviet Republic required one thousand first class scientists and specialists in various fields of knowledge, technology and practical experience for the ~urpose of guiding the labour of the people with a view to securmg the S'Jeediest possible economic revival of the country.
Let us assume l " fhfi "d" £ also that we will have to pay these stars o t e rst magmtu e -o course the majority of those who shout loudest about the corruption 21• -25,00b rubles per annum each.
Let us assume that this sum (25,000,000 rubles) will have to be doubled (assu~ing that we have to pay bonuses for the parficulariy successful and rapid fol.
:&lment of the most important of the organisational and technical tasks), or even quadrupled (assuming that we have to enlist several hundred more ·exacting foreign specialists).
The question is, would the expenditure of fifty or a hundred million rubles per annum by the Soviet Republic for the purpose.
of reorganising the labour of the people according to the last word in science and technology be excessive or too heavy? Of course not.
The overwhelming major­ ity of the class conscious workers and peasants will approve of thl.
s expenditure because they know from practical experience that our backwardness causes us to lose billions, and that we have not yet reached that degree of organisation, accounting and control which calls forth the mass and voluntary participation of the "luminaries" of the bourgeois intelligentsia in our work.
It goes without saying that this question has another aspect.
The corrupting influence of high salaries upon the Soviet govern­ ment (the more SO that the rapidity with which the revolution OC· curred could not but attract a certain number of adventurers and rogues who, together with a number of untalented or dishonest commissars, would very much like to become "star" embezzlers of state funds) and upon the masses of the workers is indisputable.
But every thinking and honest worker and poor peasant will agree, will admit, that we cannot immediately rid ourselves of the bad heritage of capitalism, and that we can liberate the Soviet Republic from the duty of paying a "tribute" o,f fifty million or one hundred million rubles per annum (a tribute for our own backwardness in organising nation-wide accounting and control from below) only by organising ourselves, by tightening up discipline in our own ranks, by purging our ranks of ail those who are "guarding the ~eritage of capitalism," who "observe the traditions of capitalism," i.
e.
, of loafers, idlers and embezzlers of state funds (now all the land, all the factories and all the railways are the "state funds" of the Soviet Republic) .
If Oro-anise become disciplined, to pull themselves up, to create strong b ' h .
' .
labour discipline in the course of one year, t en ma years time we h 11 throw o:ff this "tribute," which can be reduced even before s a h" · that .
.
• in exact proportion to the successes we ac ieve m our workers' and peasants' labour discipline and organisation.
The sooner we workers and peasants learn to acquire the best labour discipline and the highest technique of labour, using the bourgeois specialists for this purpose, the sooner sha_ll _we liberate ourselves from the duty of paying tribute to the specialists.
Our work of organising nation-wide accounting and control.
of production and distribution under the guidance of the p~o~etanat has lagged very much behind our work of directly expropnatmg ~he expropriators.
This postulate is fundamental for the understandmg of the specific features of the present situation and of the tasks.
of the Soviet government that emerged from it.
The centre of ~rav.
ity 0{ our struggle against the bourgeoisie is shifting to.
the orgamsat~on o{ such accounting and control.
OnlJ if we take this as our startmg point will it be possible properly to determine the im:nedi~t: tasks of economic and financial policy in the sphere of nationahsmg the banks, monopolising.
foreign trade, the state control of money cir­ culation the introduction of a property and income tax satisfactory from th~ proletarian point of view, and the introduction of com· pulsory labour service.
We are extremely late with socialist changes in these spheres· (very; very important spheres), and we are late precisely because accounting and control are insufficiently organised in general.
It goes without saying that this is one of the most difficult ~asks we have to fulfil, and in vi.
ew of the ruin caused by the war, it can be fulfilled only over a long peri.
od of tim~; but we must net forget that it is precisely here that the bourgeoisie-and particularly the numerous petty and peasant bourgeoisie-is putting up the most serious fight, disrupting the control that has already.

present time is precisely the preparatory organisational work that will finally consolidate our gains and that is necessary in order to prepare for the operation of "surrounding" capital and compelling it to "surrender.
" We ought to begin introducing compulsory labour service immediately, hut we ought to do so more gradually and cir· cumspectly, testing every step by practical experience, and, of course, taking the first step by introducing r:ompulsory labour service for the rich.
The introduction of labour and consumers' budget books 1 for every bourgeois, including every rural bourgeois, would be an important step towards completely "surrounding" the enemy and towards the creation of real, popular accounting and control of the production and distribution of goods.
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STRUGGLE FOR NATION·WIDE ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL The state, which for centuries has been an organ of oppression and robbery of the people, has left us a heritage of mass hatred and suspicion of everything that is connected with the state.
It is very difficult to overcome this, and only a Soviet government can do it.
But even a Soviet government will require plenty of time and enormous perseverance.
This "heritage" particularly affects the question of accounting and control-the fundamental problem facing the socialist revolution on the morrow of the overthrow of the bourgeoisie.
A certain amount of time will inevitably pass before the masses, who for the first time feel free after the overthrow of the landlords and the bourgeoisie, will understand-not from books, but from their own, Soviet experience-will understand and feel that without all-sided state accounting and control of production and distribution of goods, the power of the toilers, the freedom of the toilers, cannot be maintained, and that a return to the yoke of capitalism is.
inevitable.
All the habits and traditions of the bourgeoisie, and of the petty bourgeoisie in particular, also run counter to state ·control, and 1 Books in which are recorded the work the holder has performed and the amount of rations he has received.

it is now being particularly clearly demonstrated to us how correct is the Marxian postulate that anarch· ism and anarcho-syndicalism are 'bourgeois trends, that they irre­ concilably contradict socialism, proletarian dictatorship and com· munism.
The fight to instill into the minds of the masses the idea of Soviet state control and accounting, and to carry out this idea in practice; the fight to break with the cursed past, which taught the people to regard the gaining of bread.
and clothes as a "private" matter, as buying and selling, as a transaction "which concerns only myself"-is a great fight of world-historical significance, a fight between socialist consciousness and bourgeois-anarchist spontaneity.
We _have passed a workers' control law, hut this law is only just begmning to.
be applied and is only just barely beginning to pen­ etrate the mmds of the broad masses of the proletariat.
In our agitation we do not sufficiently explain that lack of accounting in the production and distribution of goods means the death of the rudiments of socialism, means the embezzlement of state funds­ for all property belongs to the Treasury, and the Treasury is the Soviet government, the government of the majority of the toilers-we do not explain that carelessness in accounting and control is downright aiding and abetting the German and the Rus· sian ~omilovs who can overthrow the power of the toilers only if we fail to master the task of accounting and control and who, with the aid of the muzhik bourgeoisie, with the aid of the Cadets the Menshevik~ .
and the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, are "watching" us and wa1tmg for an opportune moment fo attack us.
Nor do the advanced workers and peasants think and speak about this sufficient· ly.
And until workers' control has become a fact, until the advanced workers have organised and carried out a victorious and ruthle-ss crusade against the -viola.
tors of this control, or against those who are careless in matters of control, it will he impossible to pass from ~he fi~st step (from workers' control) to the second step, to social­ ism' i.

Capitalism left us a heritage of ·mass organisations which can facilitate our transition :o the mass accounting ,and control of the distribution of goo~s,.
viz.
, the con· sumers' co-operative societies.
In Russia these societies are not so well developed as in the advanced countries, nevertheless, they h~ve over ten million members.
The Consumers' Co-ollerative Society Law,* passed the other day, is an extremely remarkable phenome· non, which strikingly illustrates the peculiar position and the tasks of the Soviet Socialist Republic at the present moment.
.
The decree represents an agreement with the b~ur.
geois ?o­ operative societies and the workers' co-operative societies which still adhere to the bourgeois point of view.
The agreement, or com· promise, lies firstly in that the representatives of the institutions mentioned not only took part in discussing the decree, but actually obtained the right to a deciding vote; for the parts of the decree which were strongly opposed by these institutions wer~ dropped.
Secondly, in essence the compromise lies in that the ~oviet gove~n­ ment has.
abandoned the principle of no entrance fees m co-operative societies (which is the only consistently proletarian principle) and also the principle of uniting the whole of the populat~on in a give? locality in a single co-operative society.
In retre~tmg from this principle, which alone is a socialist pr.
inciple an? which co~:espo~ds to the task of abolishing classes, the nght was given to the workmg class co-operative societies" (which in this case call themselves "class" societies only because they subordinate themselves to the class interests of the bourgeoisie) to continue to exist.
Finally, the Soviet government's proposal to expel the bourgeoisie entirely from the management boards of the co-operative societies was also con· siderably modified, and the bar to membership of management boards was extended only to owners of private capitalist commercial and industrial enterprises.
-.
.
.
· Had· the proletariat, operating through the Soviet government, managed to organise accounting and control on a nation.
al scale, of such control, it would not have been necessary to enter into such compromises.
Through the ~oo~ departments of the Soviets, through the Soviet supply organ-1satior:s, we ';ould ~ave organised ihe population into a single co­ operative society guided by the proletariat-without the assistance of t?e bourgeois co-operative societies, without making any con­ cess10n to the purely bourgeois principle which induces the workers' co-oper~tive s~ci~ties _to remain workers' societies side by side with hourg~o1s so?1e:ies, z~stead of subordinating these bourgeois co­ operat1v~ societies entirely to themselves, merging the two together and takmg t~e management of the society and the supervision of the consumption of the rich in their own hands.
_In_ concluding_ such an agreement with the bourge~is co-operative societies, the Soviet government concretely defined its tactical tasks and its ~eculiar ~~thods of operation in the present stage of develop· ment'.
viz.
, b~ guidmg the bourgeois elements, utilising them, making certam partial concessions to them, we create the conditions for further ~rogress that will he slower than we at first anticipated, but sur.
er, ~1th better bases and lines of communication and better con­ sohdat10n of the positions which have been won.
The Soviets can (and sho':ld) now measure their successes in the field of socialist const~uct10n, among other things, by extremely clear, simple and practical standards, viz.
, in how many communes or villages, or blocks of houses, etc.
, co-operative societies have been organised and :o what extent their development has reached the point of em'.

RAISING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF LABOUR In every socialist revolution, after the proletariat has solved the probl~m.
of capturing power, and to the extent that the task of ex­ propnatmg t~e expropriators has been carried out in the main, there_ necessar:ly comes to the forefront the fundamental task of creatmg a social system that is superior to capitalism viz ra1• • th d .
.
f .
' .
, sing e pro uctivrt~ o labour, and in this connection (and for this purpose) securmg better organisation of labour.
Our Soviet .
ernment is precisely in the p·osition in which, thanks to the vic~:;y becomes immediately clear that while it is possible to get control of the central government in a few days, while it is possible to suppress the military resistance and sabotage of the exploiters even in ~if­ ferent parts of a great country in a few weeks, the permanent solution of the problem of raising the productivity of labour requires, at all events (particularly after a terrible and ruinous war), several years.
The protracted nature of the work is certainly dictated by objective circumstances.
.
.
The raising of the productivity of labour first of all requires that the material basis of large-scale industry shall be assured, viz.
, the development of the production of fuel, iron, the engineering and chemical industries.
The Russian Soviet Republic is in the favourable position of having at its command, even after the Brest­ Litovsk Peace, enormous reserves of ore (in the Urals), fuel in Western Siberia (coal), in the Caucasus and the South-East (oil), in the midlands (peat), enormous timber reserves, water power, raw materials for the chemical industry (Karabugaz), etc.
The development of these natural resources by methods of modern tech­ nology lays the basis for the unprecedented progress of productive forces.
Another condition for raising the productivity of labour is, first, the raising of the educational and cultural level of the masses of the population.
This is taking place extremely rapidly, which those who are blinded by bourgeois routine are unable to see; they are unable to understand what an urge towards light and initiative is now developing among the "lower ranks" of the people thanks to the, Soviet organisation.
Secondly, a condition for economic re­ vival is the raising of the discipline of the toilers, their skill, their dexterity, increasing the intensity of labour and improving its organisation.
In this respect things are par.
ticularly bad and even hopeless if we are to believe those who allow themselves to be frightened by the bourgeoisie or by those who ate serving the bourgeoisie for their own ends.
These people do not understand that there has not been, nor could there be, a revolution in which the supporters of the old raise a howl about chaos, anarchy, etc.
Naturaily, among the masses who have only just thrown off an unprecedentedly savage yoke there is deep and widesi;iread seething and ferment, the working out of new principles of labour discipline is a very pro.
, tracted process, and this process could not even start until complete victory had been achieved over the landlords and the bourgeoisie~ But without in the h·ast dropping into the despair, very often pretended, which is spread by the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois in­ tellectuals (who have despaired of retaining their old privileges), we must under no circumstances conceal an obvious evil.
On the contrary, we shall expose it· and intensify the Soviet methods of combating it, because the victory of socialism is inconceivable with· out the victory of proletarian conscious discipline over spontaneous petty-bourgeois anarchy-this real guarantee of a possible restora· tion of Kerenskyism and Kornilovism.
The more class conscious vanguard of the Russian proletariat has already set itself the task of t'aising labour discipline.
For ex­ ample, the Central Committee of the Metal Workers' Union and the Central Council of Trade Unions have begun to draft the necessary measures ~nd decrees.
* This work must be supported and pushed forward with all speed.
We must raise the question of piece work and.
apply and test it in practice; we must raise the question of ap~ plymg much of what is scientific and progressive in the Taylor system, we must make wages correspond to the total amount of goods turned out, or to the amount 0£ work done by the railways, the water transport system, etc.

on of competition, and on the other hand the application of coerc10n, so that the slo· gan "dictatorship of the proletariat" shall not be desecrated by the practice of a jelly-fish proletarian government.
THE ORGANISATION OF COMPETITION Among the absurdities which the bourgeoisi~ a:e fond of spre~d­ ing about socialism is the argument that Socialists deny t~e .
im­ portance of competition.
As a matter of fact, it is only socialism, which, by abolishing classes, and cons~quently, by abolishing the enslavement of the masses, for the first time opens the way fo: com­ petition on a really mass scale.
And it is precisely the-Soviet o~­ ganisation, in passing from the formal democracy of the bo~rgeo~s republic to the real participation of the masses ?~ the toilers m administration, that for the first time puts compet1t10n on a bro~d basis.
It is much easier to organise this in the political field th~n m the economic field; but for the success of socialism, it is precisely the latter that is important.
.
.
.
Take for example, a means of organising competition like publicit;.
The bourgeois republic ensures publicity ~nly formal~y; as a matter of fact, it subordinates the press to capital, entertams the "mob" with sensational political trash, conceals what takes place in the workshops, in commercial transactions, contracts, etc.
, with a veil of "commercial secrets," which protect "the sacred right of.
pro· perty.
" The Soviet government has abolished commercial s~crets; it has entered a new path; but we have done hardly anythmg to .
I ous bourgeois press, we must syste!Ilatically set to work to create a pres~ that will not entertain and° fool the masses with political sensat10ns and trivialities, but which will bring the questions of ev~ryday economics before the court of the people and assist in the serious st~dy of these qu:stions.
Every factory, every village, is a producers and consumers commune, whose right and duty it is to app~y the general S~viet !aws in their own way ("in their own way," not m the sense of v10latmg them, but in the sense that they can ap­ ?ly them in v~rious fori:ns).
an~ to solve the problems of accounting m t~e ~roduc~10n and distribution of goods in their own way.
Under capitalism, this was the "private affair" of the individuaf capitalist, landlor~ and kulak.
Under the Soviet state, it is not a private affair, but an important affair of state.
And we have ~ot yet started on the enormous, difficult, b~t grate­ _ful task of ?rgamsing competition between communes, of introduc­ mg accountrng and publicity in the process of the production of bre~d, clothes and other things, of transforming dry, dead bureau­ cratic accounts_ int.

ly be exceedmgly restricted, and only those who are imbued with petty-bourgeois illusions can dream of "cor­ r~cting'' capitalism by the force of example of good institu­ tions.

In and make them popular so that the toilers themselves may gradually learn to understand and see how long it is necessary to work, how much time can be al­ lowed for rest, so that the comparison of the business results of the various communes may become a matter of general interest and study, and that the most outstanding communes may be rewarded immediately (by reducing the working day to a certain extent, raising wages, placing a larger amount of cultural or resthetic facili­ ties, or other values, at their disposal, etc.
).
When a new class comes forward on the historical arena as the leader and guide of society, a period of strong "tossing," shocks, struggle and storm, a period of uncertain steps, experiments, waver­ ing, hesitation in regard to the selection of new methods correspond­ ing to the new objective circumstances, is inevitable.
The dying feudal nobility avenged themselves on the bourgeoisie which van­ quished them and took their place, not only by conspiracies and at­ tempts at rebellion and restoration, but also by pouring ridicule upon the lack of skill, the clumsiness and the mistakes of the "up­ starts" and the "insolent" who dared to take hold of the "sacred helm" of state without the centuries of training which the princes, barons, nobles and dignitaries had had, in exactly the same way as the Kornilovs and Kerenskys, the Gotzes and Martovs and the whole of that fraternity of heroes of bourgeois swindling or bour­ geois scepticism avenge themselves on the working class of Russia for having "dared" to take power.
Of course, not weeks, but long months and years are required in order that the new social class, and the class which up to now has been oppressed and crushed by poverty and ignorance at that, may master its new position, look around, organise its work and promote its organisers.
It goes without saying that the Party which led the revolutionary proletariat could not acquire the experience and habits of large organisational undertakings embracing mil­ lions and tens of millions of citizens; the remoulding of the old, almost exclusively agitators' habits is a very long process.
But there is nothing impossible in this, and as soon as the necessity for a change is clearly appreciated, as soon ·as there is firm determina-.
' !.
! gn~at _and dijli_cult_ aim,_ we.
shall achiev(l it.
There is a11 enormou~ amount of organising talent among the "people," i.
e.
, the workers and the peasants who do not expfoit the labour of others.
Capital crushed these talented people in thousands; it killed them and threw them on the scrap-heap.
We are not yet able to find them, promote them, encourage them, and put them on their feet.
But we will learn to do so if we set about it with revolutionary enthusiasm, without which there can be no victorious revolutions.
No profound and mighty popular movement has ever occurred in history without scum rising to the top, without adventurers and rogues, boasters and shouters attaching themselves to the inexperi­ enced novices, without senseless fuss, confusion, aimless bustling, without individual "leaders" trying to deal with twenty matters at once and not finishing any one of them.
Let the pups of bourgeois society, from Belorussov to Martov, squeal and yelp about the chips that are flying while the old tree is being cut down.
What else are pups for if not to yelp at the proletarian elephant? Let them yelp.
We shall go our road and try as carefully and as patiently as pos­ sible to test and discover real organisers, people with sober minds and a practical outlook, people who combine loyalty to socialism with ability without fuss (and in spite of fuss and noise) to or­ ganise the strongly welded and harmonious joint work of a large number of people within the framework of Soviet organisation.
Only such people, after testing them a score of times, by moving them from the simplest tasks to the most difficult, should he pro­ moted to the responsible posts of leaders of the people's labour, leaders of administration.
We have not yet learned to do this, but we shall learn to do so.

o are hopelessly stupid or who have obstinately decided to turn t~eir backs on the truth can be under any misapprehension c?ncernmg this.
Either .
the dictatorship of Kornilov (if we take h1~ as the Russian type of bourgeois Cavaignac) , or the dictato:ship of the proletariat-there is no other choice for a cou_ntry which has gone through an extremely rapid development with extremely sh~rp turns and amidst terrible chaos rreated by one· of the most terrible wars in history.
All solutions that offer a middle path are either an attempt on the part of the bourgeoisie to deceive the people-for the.

at they need Kornilov-or are an expression of the stupidity of the petty­ hourgeois democrats, of the Chernovs, Tseretellis and .
Martovs; and of their chatter about the unity of democracy, the d1ctatorsh1p of democracy, the general democratic front, and similar nonsense.
Those whom the progress of the Russian revolution of 1917-18 has not taught that a middle course is impossible are hopeless: .
On the other hand, it is not difficult to see that in every transit1~n from capitalism to socialism, dictatorship.
is neces~arr for two mam reasons, or along two main channels.
Fust, capitalism.
cannot be defeated and eradicated without the rut.
.
hless suppress10n of the resistance of the exploiters, who cannot at once be deprived of their wealth, of their superiority of organisation and knowledge, and con· sequently for a fairly long period will inevitably try.
to overthrow the hated rule of the poor; secondly, a great revolut10n, and a so· cialist revolution in particular, even if there were no external war, is inconceivable without internal war, i.
e.
, civil war, which is ev~n more destructive than external war, and implies thousands and 22 ~1w~l:ier, jpiplies a stat~ of ~xtre:me indi;:finiteriess, lack of ~qui· hbnum and chaos.
And of couu~e, all the elements of disintegration of the old so~iety, which are inevitably very numerous and con· nected °.
1~inly with the petty bourgeoisie (because it is the petty bourgeoisie that every war and every crisis ruins first) cannot hut "reveal themselves" in such periods of profound change.
And these elements of disintegration cannot "reveal themselves" other· 'vise ~han in the increase of crime: hoohganism, corruption, pro· fiteermg and outrages of every kind.
We must have time and an iron hand to put these down.
.
· There has not been a single great revolution in history in which ~he people did not instinctively realise this and did.
not reveal sav· mg firmness by shooting thieves on the spot.
The misfortune of previous_ revolutions has been that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, which sustained them in their state of tension and gave them the strength ruthlessly to suppress the elements of disin· tegration, did not last long.
The social, i.
e.
, the class reason for this ephemeral character of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses was ~he weakness of the proletariat, which alone is able (if it is su~cie~tly Ii.
umer~us, class conscious and disciplined) to win over to its side the ma1ority of the toilers and exploited (the majority of th~ poor, to speak more simply and popularly) and retain power sufficiently long to enable it utterly to suppress all the exploiters as well as all the elements of disintegration.
It w.
as t~is historical experience of all revolutions, it was this world-h~stor~c~l~e~onomic and political-lesson that Marx con­ fi~med m.
gwmg his short, sharp, concise and striking formula: · ~ictatorship of the proletariat.
And the fact that the Russian revolu­ tion set to work .
to f~lfil this world-historical task correctly has been proved by the victorious progress of the Soviet organisations among all t~e peoples and tongues of Russia.
For Soviet government is no~hmg more nor less than the organisational form of the dictator~ s~ip of the proletariat, the dictatorship of the advanced class which rai~es tens and tens of millfons of toilers and exploited-.
:V.
ho by th~ir own experience leanrto regard the disciplined and class con· sc10us vanguard of the proletariat as their reliable leader-to a ~-But dictatorship is_ a big wnrd, _and ~bi_g_-words should not be thrown about carelessly.
Dictatorship is iron rule, government that is revolutionarily bold, quick and ruthless in suppressing the ex· ploiters as well as hooligans.
But our government is too soft, very often it is more like jelly than iron.
We must not forget for a mo· ment that the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements are.
fighting against the Soviet go_vernment in two ways: on the one hand, they are operating from outside, by the methods of the Savinkovs, Gotzes, Gegechkoriis and Ko~nilovs, by conspiracies and rebellions, and by their fiJthy "ideological" reflection, the flood of lies and slander in the Cadet, Right Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik press; on the other hand, these elements operate from within and take· advan­ tage of every element of disintegratiOn, of every weakness, in order to bribe, to _increase indiscipline, laxity.
and chaos.
The nearer we approa~h the complete military _suppression of the bourgeoisie, the more dangerous.
the ·elements of pettY,bourgeois anarchy become.
And the fight against these elements cannot be waged solely with the aid of propaganda a~d agitation, solely by organising competition and by choosing C)rga:nisers.
The struggle roust also be waged by means of coercion.
· In proporti_qn_ as the fundamental task of the government be-comes, not military .

Jn this respect also the -revolutionary mas.
ses after November 7 [October 25], 1917, entered the right path and demonstratedthe virility of the revolution by setting up their own workers' and peasants' courts, even before the decrees dissolv· ing the bourgeois bureaucratic juridical apparatus were passed.
But our revolutionary and people's courts are extremely, incredibly weak.
One feels that we have not yet changed the people's attitude towards the courts as towards something official and alien, an atti­ tude inherited from the yoke of the landlords and of the bourgeoisie.
It is not yet sufficiently realised that the court is an organ which en: lists the who-le of the poor i:h the work of state administration (for the work of the courts is' one of the functions of state administration), 22* appreciation of the simple and sent time are hunger :n~rmc1pa 1 misfortunes of Russia at the pre­ be overcome by spurts b tunelmpboymllen.

ent.
Here and there, among Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, a positively hooligan agitation, i.
e.
, agitation appealing to bad instincts and to the small proprietor's striving to "grab all he can," has been developed against the dictatorship decree.
The question has become one of really enormous significance: first, the question of principle, viz.
, is the appointment of individual persons, dictators with unlimited powers, in general compatible with the fundamental principles of Soviet government? Secondly, what relation has this case-this precedent, if you will-to the special tasks of the govern­ ment in the present concrete situation? We must deal very atten­ tively with both these questions.
The irrefutable experience of history has shown that in the his­ tory of revolutionary movements the dictatorship of individual persons was very often the vehicle, the channel of the dictatorship of the revolutionary classes.
Undoubtedly, the dictatorship of in­ dividual persons was compatible with bourgeois democracy~ But at this point in their abuse of the Soviet government, the bourgeoisie, as well as their petty-bourgeois henchmen, always display remark· able legerdemain: on the one hand, they declare the Soviet govern­ ment to he something absurd and anarchistically savage, and they carefully evade all our historical examples and theoretical argu­ ments which prove that the Soviets are a higher form of democracy, and even more, the beginning of the socialist form of democracy; on the other hand, they demand of us a higher democracy than bourgeois democracy and say: personal dictatorship is absolutely incompatible with your, Bolshevik (i.
e.
, not bourgeois, but socialist) Soviet democracy.
These are very poor arguments.
If we are not anarchists, we must admit that the state, i.
e.
, coercion, is necessary for the transition from capitalism to socialism.
The form of coercion -is determined by the degree of development of the given revolutionary class, and also by special circumstances, such as, for example, the heritage of a long and reactionary war and the forms of resistance put up by the bourgeoisie or the petty bourgeoisie.
Hence, there is absolutely­ no contradiction in principle between Soviet (i.
e.

Take the psychology of the average rank-and-file representative of the toiling and exploited masses; compare it with the objective, material conditions of his social life.
Before the October Revolution he did not see any real effort on the part of the propertied exploiting classes to make any real sacrifice for him, to do anything for his benefit.
He did not see any attempt to give him land, liberty and peace that had been repeatedly promised him, any sacrifice of "Great Power" interests and of the interests of Great Power secret treaties, sacrifice of capital and profits.
He saw this only after November 7 [October 25], 1917, when he took this himself by force, and had to defend what he had taken by force from the Kerenskys, the Gotzes, the Gegechkoris, Dutovs and Kornilovs.
Naturally, for a certain time; all his attention, all his thoughts, all his efforts, were concentrated on taking his breath, on unbending his back, on look-ing around, on taking the benefits of life which were immediately __ _ accessible and which the overthrown exploiters had never given him.
Of course, a certain amount of time was.
required to enable the rank-and-file representative of the masses not only to see for him-self, not only to become convinced, but also to feeLthat it was not good simply to "take," to grab things, that this leads to increased chaos and ruin, to the return of the Kornilovs.
The corresponding change in the conditions of life (and consequently in the psycholo-gy) of the rank-and-file toiling masses is only just beginning.
And our task, the task of the Communist Party, which is the class con­ scious expression of the .
strivings of the exploited for emancipation, is to appreciate this change, -to understand that it is necessary, to take the lead of the exhausted masses who are wearily seeking a way.
out and lead them along the true path, along the path of labour dis­ cipline, along the path of co-ordinating the task of holding meetings and discussing the conditions of, lah_our with the task of unquestion-.

efl, more often of the malicious spite, of the bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks, the Novaya Zhizn-ists, who see only the chaos, the confusion and the outbursts of small-proprietor egoism.
But without holding meetings the masses of the oppressed could never pass from the compulsory discipline of the exploiters to class conscious, voluntary discipline.
Holding meetings is the real democracy of the toilers, it is their way of unbending their backs, their awakening-to new life, their first step along the road which they themselves have cleared of reptiles (the exploiters, the imperialists, the landlords and capitalists) and which they want to learn to lay down themselves, in their own way, for themselves, on the principles of their own "Soviet" and not alien, not aristocratic, not bourgeois rule.
The October victory of the toilers over the exploiters was required, a whole historical period was required in which the toilers themselves could first of all discuss the new conditions of life and the new tasks, in order to make possible the durable transition to superior forms of labour discipline, to the intelligent appreciation of the necessity of the dictatorship of the proletariat, to unquestioning obedience to the orders of individual representatives of the Soviet government during work time.
This transition has now commenced.
We have successfully fulfilled the first task of the revolution; we have seen how the masses of the toilers created the fundamental condition for its success: unity of effort against the exploiters in order to overthrow them.
Stages like that of October 1905, March [l<'ebruary] and November [October] 1917 are of world-historical significance.
-We have successfolly fulfilled the second task of the revolution: to awaken, to raise precisely those social "lower ranks" whom the exploiters had pushed down, and who only after November 7 [Oc.
tober 25], 1917, obtained the freedom to overthrow the exploiters and to look around and organise things in their own way.

Such are the principal distinguishing features of the democracy which is being applied in Russia, 'which is a higher type of dem· ocracy, a rupture with the bourgeois distortion of democracy, its transition to socialist democracy and to the conditions in which the state can begin to wither away.
It goes without saying that the elements of petty-bourgeois dis· organisation (which must inevitably manifest itself to some extent in every proletarian revolution, and which manifests itself particularly in our revolution, owing to the petty-bourgeois character of our country, its backwardness and the consequences of a reactionary war) cannot but leave their impress upon the Soviets.
We must work tirelessly t~ develop the organisation of the Soviets and of the Soviet government.
There is a petty-bourgeois tendency to transform the members of the Soviets into "Members of Parliament," or into bureaucrats.
This must be combated by drawing all the members of the Soviets into the practical work of administra· lion.
In many places the departments of the Soviets are gradually becoming merged with the Commissariats.
Our aim is to draw the whole of the poor into the practical work of administratl.
on, and every step that is taken in this direction-the more varied they are, the better-should he carefully registered, studied, systematised, tested by wider experience and passed into law.
Our aim is to ensure that every toiler, after having finished his eight hours' "lesson" in productive labour, shall perform state duties gratis: the transition to this is a particularly difficult one, but this transition alone can guarantee the final consolidation of socialism.
Naturally, the novelty and difficulty of the change give rise to an abundance of steps taken, as it were, gropingly, to an abundance of mistakes and vacillations­ without this, rapid progress is impossible.
The reason why the present position seems peculiar to many of those who would like to be regarded as Socialists is that they have been accustomed to con­ trasting capitalism fo socialism abstractly and that they profoundly put bet_ween th~ two the word: "leap" (some of them, recalling frag· rnents of what they have read of Engels' writings, still more pro· foundly add the phrase: "l~ap Who hut who have never .
k h .
h "l ,, seriously understood it, have never stopp~d to thm .
t at Y · eap the teachers of socialism meant changes m world history, and that leaps of this kind extended over periods of ten years and even more.
Naturally, in such times, the notorious "intelligentsia" provide an infinite number of mourners of the dead.
Some mourn .
o~er .
the Constituent Assembly, others mourn over bourgeois disc1phne, others again mourn over the capitalist system, _still others mo~rn over the cultured landlord, and still others agam mourn over 1m· perial grandeur, etc.
, etc.
The real interest of the epoch of great leaps lies in that the abundance of fragments of the old, which sometimes.
accu~ulate much more rapidly than the rudiments (not always 1mme~iately discernible) of the new, calls for the ability to discern what 1s most important in the line or chain of development.
Historical mome~ts arise wheri the most important thing for the success of the revolution is to heap up as large a quantity of the fragments as possible, i.
e.
, to blow up as many of the old institutions as possible; _moments arise when enough has been blown up and the next task 1s to per­ form the "prosaic" (for the petty-bourgeois revolutionary, the "boring") work of clearing away the fragments; and moments ar~se when the careful nursing of the rudiments of the new system, which are growing .
out of the.
wrecl.
<age on a soil which a~ yet has been badly cleared of rubble, is the most important thing.
It is not sufficient to he a rev9lutionary and an adherent of socialism, or a communist in general, One must he able at each parti­ cular moment to find that special link in the chain which one must grasp with an one's might iii order to hold .
the whole chain, and to make lasting preparations for the transition to the next link; the order of the links their form, the manner in which they are linked together, thei~· difference from each other in the historical chain of events, are not as simple and· not as senseless as those in an· ordinary_ chain·made hy a s:inith.
.
.
The fight against the bureaucratic distorti6n of the Soviet organ~ isation is mad~ secure by the firmiiess of the connection between the Soviets and the "people," meaning by that the toilers and exploitedi I i and by the flexibility and elasticity of this connection.
Even in the most democratic capitalist republics in the world, the poor never regard the bourgeois parliament as "their own" institution.
But the Soviets are "their own" and not alien institutions to the masses of workers and peasants.
The contemporary "Social-Democrats" of the Scheidemann or, what is almost the same thing, of the Martov type, are repelled by the Soviets, and they are drawn towards the respectable bourgeois parliament, or to the Constituent Assembly as much as Turgenyev, sixty years ago, was drawn towards a mod­ erate monarchist and aristocratic Constitution and was repelled by the muzhik democracy of Dohrolubov and Chernyshevsky.
It is precisely the closeness of the Soviets to the "people," to the toilers, that creates the special forms of recall and control from be­ low which must he most zealously developed now.
For example, the Councils of People's Education, as periodical conferences of Soviet electors and their delegates called to discuss and control the activ­ ities of the Soviet authorities in a given field, are deserving of full sympathy and support.
Nothing would he sillier than to transform the Soviets into something congealed and self-contained.
The more resolutely we now have to stand for a ruthlessly firm government, for the dictatorship of individual persons, in definite processes of work, in definite aspects of purely executive functions, the more varied must he the forms and methods of control from below in order to counteract every shadow of possibility of distorting the Soviet power, in order repeatedly and tirelessly to weed out bureau· cracy.
CONCLUSION An extraordinarily difficult and dangerous situation in inter­ national affairs; the necessity of manreuvring and retreating; a period of waiting for new outbreaks of the revolution which is maturing in the West at a painfully slow pace; within the country a period of slow construction and ruthless "tightening up," of pro­ longed and persistent struggle' waged by stern, proletarian discipline against the menacing element of petty-bourgeois laxity and anarchy is the link in the historical chain of events which we must grasp with all our might in order to he able to cope with the tasks that confront us hefore passing to the next link which is attracting us by its parti­ cular brightness, the brightness of the victory of the international proletarian revolution.
Try to compare the slogans that arise from the specific conditions of the present stage, viz.
, manreuvre, retreat, wait, build slowly, ruthlessly tighten up, sternly discipline, smash laxity-with the ordinary everyday concept "revolutionary.
" Is it surprising that when certain "revolutionaries" hear this they are filled with noble indignation and begin to "thunder" abuse at us for forgetting the traditions of the October Revolution, for com­ promising with the bourgeois specialists, for compromising with the bourgeoisie, for being petty bourgeois, reformists, etc.
, etc.
? The misfortune of these sorry "revolutionaries" is that even those who are prompted by the best motives in the world and are absolute­ ly loyal to the cause of socialism fail to understand the particular, and "particularly unpleasant," state that a backward country, which has been tortured by a reactionary and disastrous war and which began the socialist revolution long before the more advanced coun­ tries, has to pass through; they lack stamina in the difficult moments of a difficult transition.
Naturally, it is the "Left Socialist-Revolu­ tionaries" who are acting as an "official" opposition of this kind against our Party.
Of course, there are and always will be individu­ al exceptions in groups and class types.
But social types remain.
In the land in which the small-proprietor population greatly pre­ dominates over the purely proletarian population, the difference between the proletarian revolutionary and petty-bourgeois revolu­ tionary will inevitably make itself felt, and from time to time will make itself very sharply felt.
The petty-bourgeois revolutionary wavers and vacillates at every turn of events; he is an ardent rev· olutionary in March 1917 and praises "coalitions" in May, hates the Bolsheviks (or laments over their "adventurism") in July and runs away fr~m them in fear at the end of October, supports them in December, and finally in March and April 1918 such types, more often than not, turn up their noses contemptuously and say: p:ra(J· d.

Fits of hysteria are of no of th~ pr~letar~at~e need Is the steady march of the iron battalions March-April 1918 "LEFT-WING" CHILDISHNESS AND PETTY-BOURGEOIS MENTALITY* THE publication by a small group of-"Left Communists" of their journal, Kommunist (No.
1, April 20, 1918), and their "theses," afford striking confirmation of the views advanced by the present writer in his pamphlet: The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Govern_­ ment.
One could not wish for better confirmation, in politic-al liter· ature, of the utter naivete of the defence of petty-bourgeois laxity that is sometimes concealed by "Left" slogans.
It will be useful and necessary to deal with the arguments of the "Left Communists," because they are characteristic of the period we are passing through: they bring out in extraordinary relief the negative side, the "high point" of this period; they are instructive, because the people we are dealing with are the best of those who fail to understand the present period, people who by their knowledge and loyaity stand far, far above the ordinary representatives of the same mistaken views, viz.
, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries.
c I The "Left Communist" group has presented its "Theses on the Present Situation" as a political magnitude, or as a group claiming to play a political role.
It is a good Marxian custom to give a con­ nected and complete exposition of the principles underlying one's views and tactics.
And this good Marxian custom has helped to reveal the mistake committed by our "Lefts," because the mere at­ tempt to argue and not to declaim lays bare the unsoundness of their arguments.
The first thing that strikes one is the abundance of allusions, hints and evasions with regard to the old question as to whether it was right to conclude the Brest-Litovsk Treaty.
The "Lefts" did not dare put the question straightforwardly.
They flounder about 351 plead that "on the one hand" it may be so, but "on the other hand" it may not, their thoughts wander, over all and sundry subjects, trying all the time not to see that they are defeating themselves.
The "Lefts" are very careful to quote the figures: "twelve votes at the Party congress against peace, twenty-eight votes in favour," but they modestly refrain from mentioning that of the hundreds of votes cast at the meeting of the Bolshevik fraction of the Con<>ress of Soviets they obtained less than one-tenth.
They invent~d a "theory" that the peace policy was carried by "the war-weary and ~eclassed elements," while "the workers and peasants of the south­ ern regions, where there was greater vitality in economic life and the supply of bread was more assured," were opposed to peace .
.
.
.
Who can help laughing at such a statement? Not a word about the voting at the All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviet.
sin favour of peace, not a word about the social and class character of the typically petty-bourgeois and declassed political conglomeration in Russia w~o were opposed to peace (the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Par­ ty).
In a purely childish manner, by means of amusing "scientific" explanations, they try to conceal their own bankruptcy,· to conceal the facts, the mere catalogue of which would prove that it was pre­ cisely the declassed intellectual Party "tops" and leaders who opposed.
the peace with slogans couched in revolutionary petty­ bourgeo1s phrases, while it was precisely the masses of workers and exploited peasants who carried the vote for peace.
Nevertheless, in spite of all these declarations and evasions of the "Lefts" on the question of peace and war, the plain and manifest truth manages to come to light.
The authors of the theses are com­ pelled to admit that: "Th~ con?lu_sion of pe~ce has for the _time being weakened the attempts ?f the imperialists to bring about an mternational settlement" (this is i~acc~rately f?rmula~ed by the "Lefts," but this is not the place to deal with maccur~cies) ·.
.
The conclusion of peace has already caused the conflict between the 1mperiahst powers to become more acute.
" Now this .
is a fact.
Here is something that has decisive signi­ ~cance.
That is why the opp_g,nerits of peace were actually playthings m the hands of the imperialists, and fell into the trap laid for them.
braces several countries and is strong enough to overcome inter­ national imperialism, it is the bounden duty of the Socialists, who have conquereJ in one· country (especially a backward one) , not to accept battle against the giants of imperialism.
Their duty is to try to avoid war, to wait until the conflicts between the imperialists weaken them still more, and bring the revolution in other countries still nearer.
Our "Lefts" did not understand this simple truth in January, February and March.
Even now they are afraid of ad­ mitting it openly.
But it comes to light through all their confused reasoning like: "on the one hand it is impossible not to agree, on the other hand one must admit.
" In their theses the "Lefts" write: "During the coming spring and summer the collapse must begin of the · imperialist system which a victory for German imperialism in the.
present phase of the war can only postpone, but which will for that reason express itself in more acute forms.
" This formulation is still more childishly inaccurate, despite its scientific pretensions.
It is natural for children to understand science to mean that it can determine in what year, spring, summer, autumn and winter the "collapse must begin.
" These are absurd efforts to ascertain what cannot be ascertained.
No serious politician will ever say when this or that collapse of a "system" "must begin" (the more so that the collapse of the system has already begun, and it is now a question of the moment of the outbreak in particular countries) .
But an incontrovertible truth forces its way through this childishly helpless formula, viz.
, the outbreak of revolution in more advanced countries is nearer now, a month after the "respite" which followed the conclusion of peace, than it was a month or six weeks ago.
Hence? Hence those who were in favour of peace and who inculcated into the minds of the lovers of ostentation that one must be able to calculate the relation of forces and not help the imperialists by making the war against socialism easier for them, while socialism is still weak, and when the chances of the war are manifestly against socialism, were right, and have been proved right by the course of events.
23 selves "proletarian" Communists, although there is very little that is.
proletarian about them and very much that is petty-bourgeois-are incapable of giving thought to the relation of forces, the calculation.
of the relation of forces.
This is the main point in Marxism and· Marxian tactics, but they disdainfully brush aside the "main point"· with "proud" phrases such as: "That the masses have become firmly imbued with an inactive 'peacr.
mentality' is an objective fact of the political moment.
" · What a gem! After three years of most agonising and reaction­ ary war, the people, thanks to the Soviet government and the cor­ .
rectness of its tactics, which never became blurred in mere phrase­ mongering, obtained a very very brief, insecure and far from suf· ficient respite; butthe "Left" intellectual striplings, with the magni­ ·ficehce of a self-infatuated Narcissus, profoundly declare: "That the masses [???] have become firmly imbued with an inactive [ ! ! ! ? ? ? ] peace mentality.
" Was I not right when I said at the Party congress that the paper or journal of the "Lefts" ought to have.
been called not Kommunist but Szlachta? Could a Communist with the slightest understanding of the mentality and conditions of life of the toiling and exploited masses descend to the point of view of the typical declassed petty-bourgeois intellectual with the mental outlook of a noble who considers that a "peace mentality" is "inactive" and the brandishing of a card· board sword is "activity"? For our "Lefts" merely brandish a card· board sword when they ignore the universally known fact-of which the war in the Ukraine has served as an additional proof­ that a country which had been utterly exhausted by three years of butchery is incapable of continuing the fight without a respite; and · that war, if it cannot be organised on a national scale, often creates a mentality of disintegration peculiar to petty proprietors, instead of the iron discipline of the proletariat; Every page of the Kommu· nist shows that our "Lefts" have no conception of iron proletarian discipline and how it is achieved; that they are thoroughly imbued with the mentaiity of the declassed petty-bourgeois intellectual.
But perhaps all these phrases of the "Lefts" about war are merely childish ebullitions, which, moreover, concern the past, and therefore have not a shadow of political ·significance? This is the argument some people put up in defence of our "Lefts.
" But this argument is unsound.
Anyone aspiring to political leadership must be able to think out political problems; the lack of this ability con­ verts the "Lefts" into characterless preachers of a policy of vacilla­ tion, which objectively can have only one effect, viz.
, by their vacillation the "Lefts" are helping the imperialists.
to provoke the Russian Soviet Republic into a dearly disadvantageous war; they are helping the imperialists to draw us into a snare.
Listen to this: .
" .
.
.
The Russian workers' revolution cannot 'save itself' by abandoning the policy of world revolution, by continually avoiding battle and yielding to the pressure of international capital, by making 'concessions to home capital.
' "From this point of view it is necessary to adopt a determined class international policy, which will unite international revolutionary propaganda by word and deed, and to strengthen the organic connection with inter· natfonal socialism and not with the international bourgeoisie .
.
.
.
" I shall deal separately with the thrusts at home policy contained in this passage.
But examine this riot of phrasemongering mixed with actual timidity in the sphere of foreign policy.
What tactics are binding at the present time on all who do not wish to be tools of imperialist provocation, and who do not wish to walk into the snare? Every politician must give a clear, straightforward reply to this question.
Our Party's reply is well known.
A1t the present moment we must retreat, we must avoid battle.
Our "Lefts" dare not contradict this and shoot into the air: "A determined class inter­ national policy"!! This is deceiving the masses.
If you want to fight now, say so openly.
If you do not wish to retreat now, say so openly.
Otherwise, in your objective role, you are a tool of imperialist provocation.
And your subjeotive "mentality" is that of a frenzied petty bourgeois who swaggers and blusters, but knows perfectly well that the pro­ letarian is right in retreating and in trying to retreat in an organised way, that the proletarian is right in arguing that as we lack strength we must retreat (before Western and Eastern imperialism) even 23* -------as far as the Urals, for in this lies the only chance of playing for time while the revolution in the West matures, the revolution which is not "bound" (notwithstanding the twaddle of the "Lefts") to begin in "spring or summer," but which is approaching nearer and becoming more probable every month.
The "Lefts" have no policy of their "oW11.
" They dare not declare that retreat at the present moment is unnecessary.
They twist and turn, play with words, substitute the question of "continuously" avoiding battle for the question of avoiding battle at the present moment.
They blow bubbles, such as: "international revolutionary propaganda by-deed"! ! ! What does this mean? It can only mean one of two things: either it is mere "Nozdrev­ ism"* or it means an aggressive war to overthrow international imperialism.
Such nonsense cannot be uttered openly, and that is wliy the "Left" Communists are obliged to take refuge from the derision of every politically conscious proletarian behind high­ sounciing and empty phrases.
They hope.
the inattentive reader will not notice the real meaning of the phrase "international revolution­ ary propaganda by deed.
" The flaunting of.
high:sounding phrases is characteristic of the declassed petty-bourgeois intelligentsia.
The organised proletarian Communists will certainly punish this "habit" with nothing less than derision and expulsion from all responsible posts.
The masses must be told the bitter truth simply, clearly and straightforwardly: it is possible, and even probable, that the militarist party will again get the upper hand in Germany (that is, they will immediately com­ mence an offensive against us); and that Germany together with Japan, b'y official agreement or tacit understanding, will divide and strangle us.
Our tactics, if we do not want to listen to loud-mouthed fools, must be to wait, procrastinate, avoid battle, retreat.
If we shake off the shouters and "pull ourselves together," create genuinely iron, genuinely proletarian, genuinely Communist discipline, we shall have a real chance of gaining many months.
And then by retreating, even (if the worst comes to the worst) to the Urals, we shall make it easier for our allies (the ~_!!.
ternational proletariat) to come to our aid, to "cover" (to use a sporting term) the distance between the beginning of revolutionary outbreaks and revolution.
and such alone, are the tactics which can strengthen the links between one temporarily isolated sectipn of international socialism and the other sections.
But truth to tell, all that your arguments lead to, dear "Left Communists," is the "strengthening of the organic connection" between one high-sounding phrase and another.
A bad sort of "o;rganic connection," this! And I shall enlighten you, my amiable friends, as to why such disaster overtook you.
It is because you devote more effort to learn­ ing by heart and committing to memory revolutionary slogans than to thinking them out.
This leads you to write "the defence of the socialist fatherland" in quotation marks, which no doubt is meant to signify irony, but which really proves that you are muddleheads.
You are accustomed to regard "defencism" as something base and despicable; you have learned this and committed it to memory.
You have learned this by heart so thoroughly that some of you have begun talking nonsense to the effect that "defence of the fatherland" in an imperialist epoch is impermissible (as a matter of fact, it is impermissible in an imperialist, reactionary war, waged by the bourgeoisie).
But you have not thought out why and.
when "de­ fencism" is abominable.
To recognise defence of one's fatherland means recognising the legitimacy and justice of war .
.
Legitimacy and justice from what point of view? Only from the point of view of the socialist prole­ tariat and its struggle for emancipation.
We do not recognise any other point of view.
1£ war is waged by the exploiting class with the object of strengthening its class rule, such a war is a criminal war, and "defencism" in such a war is a base betrayal of socialism.
If war is waged by the proletariat after it has conquered the hour· geoisie in its own country, and is waged with the object of strength· ening and extending socialism, such a war is legitimate and "holy.
" We have been "defencists" since N.
ovemb_er 7 [October 25], 1917.
I have said this more than once very definitely, and you dare not deny this.
It is precisely in the interests of "strengthening con­ nections" with international socialism that we are duty bound to defend our socialist fatherland.
It is those who would treat the d~· fence of the country in which the proletariat has already achieved victory frivolously who destroy the connections with international we did not adopt a frivolous attitude towards defence of the father· land in an imperialist war; we opposed such defence on principle.
Since we have become the representatives of the ruling class, which has begun to organise socialism, we demand that all adopt a serious attitude towards defence of the country.
And adopting a serious attitude towards defence of the country means preparing thoroughly for it, and strictly calculating the relation of forces.
If our forces are obviously small, the best means of defence is retreat into the interior of the country.
Whoever regards this as an artificial formula, made up to suit the needs of the moment, is advised to read old Clause· witz, one of the greatest authorities on military matters, concerning the lessons of history to be learned in this connection.
The "Left Communists," however, do not give the slightest indication that they understand the significance of the question of the relation of forces.
When we were opposed to defencism on principle we were justified in holding up to ridicule those who wanted to "save" their fatherland, ostensibly in the interests of socialism.
When we gained the right to be proletarian defencists the whole question was radical­ ly altered.
It became our duty to calculate with the utmost accuracy the different forces involved, to weigh with the utmost care the chances of our ally (the international proletariat) being able to come to our aid.
It is in the interest of capital to destroy its enemy (the revolutionary proletariat) bit by hit, before the workers in all countries have united (actually united, i.
e.
, by .
beginning the revolution).
It is in our interest to do all that is possible to take advantage of the slightest opportunity to postpone the decisive battle until the moment (or "till after") the revolutionary ranks of the single, great, international army have been united.
III We will pass to the misfortunes of our "Left" Communists in the sphere of home policy.
It is difficult to read phrases such as the following in the theses on the present situation without smiling.
" .
.
.
The systematic use of the remaining means of production is con· _ceivable only if a most determTned policy of socialisation is pursued" .
.
.
"not capitulation to the bourgeoiSie and its servile petty-bourgeois Dear "Left Communists," how determined they are; but how little judgment they display! What do they mean by pursuing "a determined policy of socialisation"? · One may or may not be determined on the question of national­ isation or confiscation.
Brit the whole point-is that even the greatest possible "determination" is not enough to pass /tom nationalisation and confiscation to socialisation.
The misfortune of our "Lefts" ·is that by their naive, childish combination of words: "Most deter­ mined policy of socialisation" they reveal their utter failure to understand the crux of the question, the crux of the "present" situa­ tion.
The misfortune of our "Lefts" is that they have missed the essence of the ''present situation," viz.
, the transition fr.
om confisca­ tion (the carrying out of which requires above all a determined policy) to socialisation (the carrying out of which requires a different quality in the revolutionary).
Yesterday, the main task of the moment was, as determinedly as possihle, to nationalise, confiscate, beat down and crush the bour­ geoisie, and break .
down sabotage.
Today, only a blind man could fail to see that we have nationalised, confiscated, beaten down and broken more rt:han we have been able to keep count of.
And the dif­ .
ference between socialisation and simple confiscation lies precisely in the fact that confiscation can be carried out by means of "deter· mination" alone, without the ability to count up and distribute properly, whereas socialisation cannot be brought about without this ability: The historical service we have rendered is that yesterday ·we were determined (and will be tomorrow) in confiscating, in beating down the bourgeoisie, in breaking down sabotage.
To write about this today, in "Theses on the Present Situation," is to face the past, and to fail to understand the transition to the future.
"The complete break-down of sabotage!" What a task they have found! Our saboteurs are quite sufficiently "broken.
" What we lack is something quite different.
We lack the proper calculation of which saboteurs to set to work, and where to place thein; we l;:1ck the organisation of our own forces for supervision1 one Bol-cumstances to flaunt such phrases as "the most determined" policy of "socialisation,'' "beating down," and "complete break-down" is just beating the air.
It is usual for the petty-bourgeois revolutionary not to understand that beating down:, breaking down and the like is not enough for socialism.
It is sufficient for a small proprietor who is enraged against the big proprietor, but no proletarian revolu· tionary would fall into such error.
If the words we have quoted provoke -a smile, the following discovery made by the "Left Communists" will provoke nothing short .
of Homeric laughter.
According to them, under the "Right Bolshevik deviation" the Soviet Republic is threatened with "evolution in the direction of state capitalism.
" They have really frightened us this time! And with what zeal these "Left Communists" repeat this threatening revelation in their theses and articles.
.
.
.
It has never occurred to them that state capitalism would be an advance on the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic.
If we introduced state capitalism in approximately six months' time, we would achieve a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become· invincible in our country.
I can imagine with what noble indignation a "Left Com­ munist" will recoil from these words, and what "deadly criticism" he will unfold to the workers against the "Right Bolshevik devia­ tion.
" What! The transition to state capitalism in the Soviet Social­ ist Republic a step forward? Isn't this the betrayal of socialism? This is precisely where the root of the economic mistake of the "Left Communists" lies.
And that is why we must deal with this point in greater detail.
In the first place, the "Left Communists" do not exactly under· stand the nature of the transition from capitalism to socialism which gives us the right and the grounds on which to call our country· the Socialist Republic of Soviets.
Secondly, they reveal their petty-bourgeois character precisely in not recognising the petty-bourgeois element as the principal enemy of socialism in our cwntry.
· I Soviet state and the bourgeois state.
Let us examine these three points.
No one, I think, in studying the question of the economics of Russia, has denied their transitional character.
Nor, I think, has any Communist denied that the term Socialist Soviet Republic implies the determination of the Soviet government to achieve the transition to socialism, and not that the new economic order is a socialist order.
But what does the word "transition" mean? Does it not mean, as applied to economics, that the present order contains elements, particles, pieces 0£ both capitalism and socialism? Everyone will admit that it does.
But not all who admit.
this take the trouble to consider the precise nature of the elements that constitute the various social-economic forms which exist in Russia at the present time.
And this is the crux of the question.
Let us enumerate these elements: 1) patriarchal, i.
e.
, to a con­ siderable extent natural, self-sufficing peasant economy; 2) small­ commodity production (this includes the majority of those peasants who sell their grain); 3) private capitalism; 4) state capitalism, and 5) socialism.
Russia is so vast and so varied thnt all these different types of social-economic forms are intermingled.
This is what constitutes the peculiar feature of the situation.
The question arises: what elements preponderate? Clearly, in a small-peasant country, the preponderating element must be the petty-bourgeois element, nor can it be otherwise, for the majority and the great majority of the tillers of the soil are small-commodity producers.
Hence, the shell of state capitalism (grain monopoly, state-controlled producers and traders, bourgeois co-operators) is pierced, now in one place, now in another, by profiteers, and the chief object of profiteering is grain .
.
It is precisely in this field that the struggle is mainly proceeding.
Between what elements is this struggle being waged, if we are.
to speak in terms of economic categories such as "state capitallsm"? Between the fourth and the fifth in the order in which I have just with socialism; it is the petty bourgeoisie plus private capitalism fighting against both state capitalism and socialism.
The petty bourgeoisie oppose every kind of state interference, regulation and control, whether it be state capitalist or state socialist.
This is an absolutely incontrovertible fact of our-reality, ·the failure to understand· which lies at the root of the economic mistake of the "Left Communists.
" The profiteer; the trade marauder, the dis­ rupt-er of monopoly-these are our principal "internal" enemies, the enemies of the economic enactments of the Soviet government.
A hundred· and twenty, five years ago it might nave been excusable for the French petty bourgeois, the most ardent and sincere of revolutionaries, to endeavour to crush the profiteer by executing a few of the "chosen" ones and by thunderous-.
declamations; but today the purely rhetorical attitude to this question assumed by some Left Socialist-Revolutionaries can rouse nothing but disgust and revulsion in an intelligent revolutionary.
We know perfectly well that the economic basis of profiteering is the small proprietors, who are unusually widespread in Russia, and private capitalism, of which every petty bourgeois is an ··agent.
We know that the million tentacles of this petty-bourgeois hydra encircle first one and then another section of the working class, that instead of state monopoly profiteering forces its way through all the pores of our social and economic' organism.
· Those who fail to see this show by theiT blindness that they are capti;es to petty-bourgeois prejudices.
This is precisely the case with our "Left Communists," who in words (and of course in their deepest convictions) are merciless enemies of the petty bourgeoisie, while in fact they help only the petty bourgeoisie, serve only this stratum, express only its point of view by fighting, in April 1918! !­ against •.
.
"state capitalism.
" Beating the air! The petty bourgeois has money put away, several thousands gained by "honest" and especially by dishonest means, <luring the war.
This is the economic type, the characteristic type, that serves as the basis of profiteering and private capitalism.
Money is a cer· tincat(;l entitling the possessor to receive social wealth; and a tificate conceal it from the "state.
" They do not believe m soCiahsm ' · and "si"t tight" until the proletarian storm blows or communism, over.
Either we subordinate this petty bourgeoisie to our c?ntrol and accounting (we can do this if we organise the poor, that_ i_s, the ajority of the population or semi-proletariat, round the politically :nscious proletarian vanguard), or they will overthrow ou: work· ers' government as surely and as inevita~ly as the revolution was overthrown by the Napoleons and Cavaignacs who.
sp:ang from this very soil of small ownership.
This is ~ow the que~t10n ~tands.
The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries alone fail to see this P,~ai~ _an~ evident truth through their mist of phrases about the to~h~g peasantry; but who· takes these phrasemongering Left Socialist· Revolutionaries seriously? The petty bourgeoisie, hoarding their thousa~ds, are the en­ emies of state capitalism.
They want to use their thousands for ·themselves, against.
the poor, in the teeth of all state _co.
ntrol.
And the sum total of these thousands, amounting to many b1lhons, forms the basi~, of the profiteering which is disrupting our socialist con­ struction.
Let us suppose that a given number of workers produce in a certain number of days goods to the value of, say, 1000.
Sup.
pose ' further that of this total 200 is lost to us as a result ' ' .

Every politically consc~ous worker will say: if better order and organisation could be obtamed at the price of 300 I would willingly give ~00 instead of 200 out of the 1000 for it will be easy under the Soviet government to reduce this "tribute" to 100 or to 50 later on, when order and organisation are established and the pE;tty-bourgeois disruption of state monopoly is finally stopped.
.
.
This simple illustration in figures-which I have deliberately simplified.
to the utmost in order to make .
it _absofotely c_le~r­ explains the present correlation of state capitalism and socialism.
The workers hold political power; they have every legal oppo~un· ity of "taking" the whole thousand, i.

It is not even worth while arguing with a Left Socialist-Revolutionary.
It is enough to point to him a " I · I ,, · s a repu s1ve e~amp e of a wind-~ag.
But the "Left Communists" must be argued w~th, heca~se the errmg ones are Marxists, and an analysis of their mistake w1ll·help the working class to find the true road.
IV To elucidate the question still more, let us first of all take the m?st concrete example of state capitalism.
Everybody knows wh t th·s exam I · It · G -a • P e is.
is ermany.
Here we have "the last word" in modern large-scale capitalist technique and planned organisation, subordinated to Junker-bourgeois imperialism.
* Cross out the words in italics, and, in place of the militarist, Junker-bourgeois imperial­ ist state, put a state, but of a different social type, of a different class content-a Soviet, that is, a proletarian state, and you will have the sum total of the conditions necessary for socialism.
Socialism is inconceivable without large-scale capitalist tech­ nique based on the last word of modern science; it is inconceivable without planned state organisation which subjects tens of millions of people to the strictest observance of a single standard in pro­ duction and distribution.
We Marxists have always insisted on this, and it is not worth while wasting two seconds talking to-people who do not understand even this (anarchists and a good half of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries).
At the same time socialism is inconceivable unless the prole­ tariat is the ruler of the state.
This also is A B C.
And history (which nobody, except Menshevik blockheads of the first rank, ever expected to bring about "complete" socialism smoothly,· gently, easily and simply) took such an original course that it "brought forth" in 1918 two unconnected halves of socialism existing side by side like two future chickens in the single shell of international imperialism.
In 1918 Germany and Russia w~re the embodiment of the most striking material realisation of the economic; the produc­ tive, the social-economic conditions for socialism,-on the one hand, and the political conditions, on the other.
A successful proletarian revolution in Germany would· im­ mediately and very easily have shattered the shell of imperialism (which, unfortunately, is made· of the best steel, and hence cannot be broken by the efforts of any and every _ •.
chicken), it would have brought about the victory of world socialism for certain, with­ out any difficulty, or with slight difficulty-if, of course, by "dif­ ficulty" we mean difficult on a world-historical scale, and not in the philistine-circle sense.
While the revolution in Germany is slow in "coming forth," our task is to study the state capitalism of the Germans, to spare no effort in copying it and not shrink from adQ.
pting rf,ictatoriaJ meth­ ods to hasten the copying of it.
Our task is to do this even more 1 hastened the copying of Western culture by barbarian Russia, and he did not hesitate to use barbarous methods in fighting against barbarism.
If ther'e are anarchists and Left So­ cialist-R.
evolutionaries (I suddenly recall the speeches of Karelin and Ge on the C.
E.

) who indulge in Narcissus-like reflections and say that it is unbecoming for us, revolutionaries, to "take lessons" from German imperialism, there is only one thing we can say in reply to this: the revolution would perish irrevocably (and deservedly), if we took these people seriously.
At present, petty-bourgeois capitalism prevails in Russia, and it is one and the same road that leads from it to large-scale state capital­ ism and to socialism, through one and the same intermediary station called "national accounting an& control of production and distri­ bution.
" Those who fail to understand this are committing an un­ pardonable mistake in economics.
·Eitfier they do not know the facts· of reality, do not see what actually exists and are unable to look the truth in the face; or they confine themselves to abstractly com" paring "capitalism" with "socialism" and fail to study the concrete forms and stages of the transition that is taking place in our coun­ try.
Let it be said in parenthesis that this is the very theoretical mistake which misled the best people in the N ovaya Zhizn and V peryod camp.
The worst and the mediocre of these, owing to their stupidity and spinelessness, drag at the tail of the bourgeoisie, of whom they stand in awe.
The best of them failed to understand that it was not without reason that the teachers of socialism spoke of a whole period of transition from capitalism to socialism and em­ phasised the "prolonged birth pangs" of the new social order .
.
Arid this new order is an abstraction which can come into being only by passing through a series of varied, imperfect, concrete attempts to create this or that socialist state.

capitalists to the workers in England would have been assured at that time owiiig to the fol­ lowing circumstances: 1) the absolute preponderance of workers, i.
e.
, proletarians, in the population owing to the absence of a peasantry (in England in the 'seventies there was every hope of an extremely rapid spread of socialism among agricultural labourers); 2) the excellent organisation of the proletariat in trade unions (England was at that time the leading country in the world in this respect) ; 3) the comparatively high level of culture of the proletariat which had been trained by centuries of development of political liberty; 4) the old habit of the well-organised English capitalists of settling political and economic questions by com­ promise-at that time the English capitalists were better organised than the capitalists of any country in the world (this superiority has now passed to Germany).
These were the circumstances which at that time gave rise to the idea that the peaceful subjugation of the English capitalists by the workers was possible.
In Soviet Russia, at the present time, this subjugation is assured by certain premises of fundamental significance (the victory in October and the suppression, from October to February, of the armed and sabotaging resistance of the capitalists) .
But instead of the absolute preponderance of workers, that is, of proletarians in the population, and a high degree of organisation among them, the important factor of victory in Russia was the support the prole­ tarians received from the poorest and quickly pauperised peasantry.
Finally, we have neither a high degree of culture nor the habit of compromise.

There i~ still too little of that ruthlessness which is indispensable for the success of socialism, not because we lack determination, we have sufficient determination, but because we do not know how to capture quickly enough a sufficient num­ ber of profiteers, marauders and capitalists-the people who infringe the enactments of the Soviets.

.
Bukharin is a well-educated Marxian economist.
Hence he remembered that Marx was profoundly right when he taught the workers the importance of preserving the organisation of large­ scale production precisely for the purpose of facilitating the transi­ tion to socialism and that (as an exception, and England was then an exception) the idea was conceivable of paying the capitalists well, of buying them off, if the circumstances were such as to com­ pel the capitalists to submit peacefully and to come over to socialism in a cultured and organised fashion, provided they were bought off.
But Bukharin fell into error because he did not study sufficiently the concrete peculiarity of the situation in Russia at the present time -an exceptional situation.
We, the Russian proletariat, are in advance of England or Germany as regards our political order, as regards the strength of the political power of the workers; but we are behind the most backward West European country as regards well-organised state capitalism, as regards our level of culture and the degree of material and productive preparedness for the "intro­ duction" of socialism.
Is it not clear that the peculiar nature of the present situation creates the need for a peculiar type of "buying off" which the workers should offer to the most cultured, the most skilled, the most capable organisers among the capitalists who are ready to enter the service of the Soviet government and to help honestly in organising "state" industry on the largest possible scale? Is it not clear that in such a peculiar situation we must make every effort to avoid two mistakes, both of which are of petty-bourgeois establishing accounting and control! In the second place, the courts are not sufficiently firm.
Instead of sentencing people who take bribes to be shot, they sentence them to six months' imprisonment.
These defects have the sai:ne social root: the influences of petty-bourgei:Jis laxity and anarchy.
dare that since there is a discrepancy between our economic or~es and our political forces, it "follows" that we should ~ot ha_ve seized power.
Such an argument can be advanced only by a man ma muf· fler" who forgets that there will always be such a "discrepa~cy," that it always exists in the development of nature as well as m the _de­ velopment of society, that only by a series of attempts-ea~h ~f whic.
h, taken by itself, will be one-sided, will suffer from certam m~onsis­ tencies-will complete socia,lism be created by the revolutionary co-operation of the proletariat of all countries.

On the other hand, it would be an obvious mistake to give free rein to shouters and phrasemongers, who allow themselves to be attracted by "dazzling revolutionism" but who are incapable of sustained, thoughtful and deliberate revolutionar!.
work which takes into account the most difficult stages of transitwn.
Fortunately, the history of the development of therevol_utionary parties and of the struggle Bolshevism waged against them i has left us a heritage of sharply defined types; of these, the Left Socialist· Revolutionaries and Anarchists are striking examples of bad revo­ lutionaries.
They are now shouting-shouting hysterically, shouting themselves hoarse--against the "compromise" of the "Right Bolshe­ viks.
" But they are incapable of thinking why "compromi:e" is bad, and why "compromise" has been justly condemned by history and the course of the revolution.
Compromise in Kerensky's time surrendered.

The compromise of a section o~ the Bolsheviks in October-November 1917* either feared the seizure of power by the proletariat or wished to share power equall~, ~ot only with "unreliable fellow travellers" like the Left Sociahst­ Revolutionaries, but also with the enemy, with the Chernovist: ~ and the Mensheviks, who would inevitably have hindered us 1~ fundamental matters, such as the dissolution of the Constituent As­ sembly, the ruthless suppression of the Bogayevskys, the complete 1 Mensheviks Socialist-Revolutionaries and Anarchists.

Now power has been seized, retained and consolidated in the hands of a single party, the party °'f the proletariat, even without the "unreliable fellow travellers.
" To speak of compromise at the present time when there is no question, and can be none, of sharing power, of renouncing the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, is merely to repeat, parrot-fashion, words which have been learned by heart, but not understood.
To describe as "compro­ mise" the fact that, having arrived at a situation when we can and must rule the country, we try to win over to our side, not grudging the cost, the most cultured elements capitalism has trained, to take them into out service against small-proprietor disintegra.
tion­ calling this compromise reveals a total incapacity to think out the economic problems of socialist construction.
Therefore, while it is to Comrade Bukharin's credit that on the C.

he "felt ashamed" of the "service" rendered him by Karelin and Ge, nevertheless, as far as the "Left Communist" trend is concerned, the references to their political comrades-in-arms still serve as a serious warning.
Take for example the Znamya Truda,1 the organ of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, of April 25 1918 which proudly declares: -' ' .
"The present position of our party coincides with that of another trend rn Bolshevism (Bukharin, Pokrovsky and others).
" Or take the Menshevik J!peryod of the same date which con­ tains, among other articles, the following "thesis" dra~ up by the well-known Menshevik Isuv: .
"Lacking a ~enuinely proletari_an character from the very outset, the policy of the Soviet government has lately pursued a still more undisguised cou;se of.

On the pretext of nationalising industry, a policy_ of establishrng_ rndustnal trusts is being pursued; on the pretext of resto_rmg the _productive forces of the country, attempts are being made to abolis~ the e1gh_t-~ou_r d_ay, to i_ntroduce piece work and the Taylor system, bla~klists and victlm1sat10n.
This policy threatens to deprive the proletariat of its most important economic gains and to make it a victim of the un· restricted exploitation of the bourgeoisie.

Magnificent, is it not? Kerensky's friends, who, together with him, conducted ·an imperialist war for the sake of the secret treaties, who promised annexations to the Russian capitalists, the colleagues of Tseretelli, who, on June 22 [9], threatened to disarm the workers;1 the Lie­ berdans who screen the rule of the bourgeoisie with high-sound­ ing phrases-these-these are the people who accuse the Soviet government of "compromising'' with the bourgeoisie, of "establish­ ing trusts" (that is of establishing "state capitalism"!), of introduc· ing the Taylor system! Indeed, the Bolsheviks ought to present Isuv with a medal, and his thesis ought to be placed in every workers' club and union, as an example of the provocative utterances of the bourgeoisie.
The work­ ers know these Lieberdans, Tseretellis and Isuvs very well now.
They know them from experience, and it would be very useful in­ deed for the workers to ponder over the reason why such lackeys of the bourgeolsie should incite the workers to resist the Taylor system and the "establishment of trusts.
" Class conscious workers will carefully compare the thesis of Isuv, the friend of Messi~urs the Lieberdans and the Tseretellis, with the following thesis of the "Left Communists.
" "The introduction of labour discipline in connection with the restoration of capitalist management of industry cannot really increase the productivity of labour, but it will diminish the class initiative, activity and organisation of the proletariat.
It threatens to enslave .
the working class; it .
will rouse discontent among the backward elements as well as among the vanguard of the proletariat.
In order to ·introduce this systeni.
in the face of the hatred prevailing at present among the proletariat against the 'capitalist saboteurs,' the Communist Party would have to rely· on the petty bour­ geoisie, as against the workers, and in this way would ruin itself as the party of the proletariat.

) This is the most striking proof of the fact that the "Lefts" have fallen into the trap, have allowed themselves to be provoked by the Jsuvs and the other Judases of capitalism.
It serves as a good lesson for the workers, who know that it is precisely the vangnard of the proletariat which stands for· the introduction of labour disc.
ipline and that it is precisely the petty bourgeoisie which is doing its utmost to disrupt this discipline.

.
"In connection with the restoration of capitalist management"­ such are the words with which the "Left Communists" hope to defend themselves! A perfectly useless defence, because, in the first place, in placing "management" in the hands of capitalists the Soviet government appoints workers' commissars, or workers' committees, who will watch every step of the manager, -who will learn from his experience in management, who will not only have the right to appeal against his orders, but to secure his removal through the organs of the Soviet government.
In the second place, "manage­ ment" is entrusted to capitalists only in regard to executive functions while at work, the conditions of which are determined by the Soviet government, by whom they may be abolished or revised.
In the third place, management is entrusted by the Soviet government to capitalists not as capitalists, but as highly-paid specialist-technicians or organisers.
And the workers know very well that ninety-nine per cent of the organisers and first-class technicians of really large-scale and giant enterprises, trusts or other establishments belong to the cap­ italist class.
But it is precisely these people whom we, the proletarian party, must appoint to direct the labour process and the organisation of production, for there are no other people who have practical ex­ perience in this business; for the workers, having emerged from the infancy in which they could be misled by Left phrases or petty.
bourgeois loose thinking, are advancing towards socialism through the capitalist management of trusts, through gigantic machine in­ dustry, through enterprises having a turnover of several millions per annum-only through such a system of production and such enterprises.
The workers are not petty bourgeois.
They are not afraid of large-scale "state capitalism," they prize it as their proletarwn weapon which their government, the Soviet government, will use against small-proprietor disintegration and disorganisation.
This is incomprehensible only to the declassed and consequent­ ly thoroughly petty-bourgeois intelligentsia, typified among the "Left Commun.
ists" by Ossi~ky, when he writes in their journa,J; I l I teach them, or make rank-and-file workers out of them, we are going to learn from them.
" (Kommunist, No.
1, p.
14, col.
2:) The attempted irony in this phrase is aimed at my words: "Learn socialism from the organisers of trusts.
" · Ossinsky thinks this is funny.
He wants to make "rank-and-file workers" out of the organisers of the trusts.
If this had been written by a man of the age of which the poet wrote: "Fifteen years, not more? .
.
.
"-there would have been nothing surprising about it.
But it is somewhat strange to hear such things from a Marxist who has learned that socialism is impossible unless it makes use of the achievements of the technique and culture create.
d by large-scale capitalism.
Not a trace of Marxism is to be found in this.
No.
Only those who understand that it is impossible to create or introduce socialism without learning from the .
organisers of trusts are worthy of the name of Communists.
For socialism is not a fig­ ment of the imagination; it is the assimilation and application by the proletarian vanguard, after it has seized power, of what has been created by the trusts.
We, the party of the proletariat, have no other way of acquiring the ability to organise large-scale production of the trust type, as trusts, except by acquiring it from the first-class capitalist specialists.
We have nothing to teach them, unless we undertake the childish task of "teaching" the bourgeois intelligentsia socialism.
We must not teach them, but expropriate them (as is being done in Russia "determinedly" enough), break their sabotage, subordinate them as a stratum or.
group to the Soviet.
government.
· We, on the other.
hand, if we are not Communists of infantile age and infantile understanding, must learn from them; for the party of the proletariat and its vanguard have no experience of independent work in organising giant enterprises which serve the needs of scores of millions of people.
And the best workers in Russia have realised this.
They have begun to learn from the capitalist organisers, the engineer-directors and the specialist technicians.
They have begun rto learn steadily and cautiously with easy things, gradually passin$ on to the more ties.
But the textile, tobacco and leather workers are not afraid of state capitalism or of "learning fro:m the organisers of trusts" as the declassed petty-bourgeois intelligentsia are.
These workers in the leading enterprises of the type of Glavkozha and of Centrotextil 1 take their place by the side of the capitalists, learn from them, estab­ lish trusts, establish "state capitalism" which under the Soviet gov­ ernment represents the threshold of socialism, the condition of its permanent victory.
This work of the most advanced workers of Russia, together with their work of introducing labour discipline, has gone on and is proceeding quietly, unobtrusively, Without the noise and fuss so necessary to some "Lefts.
" It is proceeding very cautiously and gradually, taking into account the lessons of practical experience.
This hard work, the work of learning practically how to build up large-scale production is the guarantee that we are on the right road, the guarantee that the class conscious workers in Russia are carrying on the struggle against small-proprietor anarchy, against petty-bourgeois indiscipline 2-the guarantee of the victory ot com­ munism.
VI Two remarks in conclusion.
In arguing with the "Left Communists" on April 4 1918 ( ;r • ' · Kommunist, No.
1, p.
4, footnote), I bluntly put it to them: "Ex.
plain why you are dissatisfied with the Railway Decree; submit your amendments to it.

I "Left Communists," the Railway Decree should be altered or amended.
1 The "Left Communists" stand condemned by their own silence.
They did nothing but attack the Railway Decree with all sorts of insinuations (pp.
8 and 16 of No.
1), but gave no articulate answer to the question: "How .
should the Decree be amended if it is wrong?" No comment is needed.
The class conscious workers will call such "criticism" of the Railway Decree (which is a typipal example of our line of action, the line of firmness, the line of dictatorship, the line of proletarian discipline) either ''Isuvian" criticism or empty phrasemongering.
Second remark.
The first issue of Kommunist contained a very flattering review by Comrade Bukharin of my pamphlet The State and Revolution.
But however much I value the opinion of people like Bukharin, my conscience compels me to say that the character of the review reveals a sad and significant fact.
Bukharin regards the tasks of the proletarian dictatorship from the point of view of the past and not of the future.
Bukharin noted and emphasised that which may be common in the point of view of the proletarian and that of the petty-bourgeois reYolutionary on the question of the state.
But Bukharin "failed to note" the very thing that distinguishes the one from the other.
Bukharin noted and emphasised the fact that the old state ma­ chine must be "smashed" and "blffwn up," that the bourgeoisie must be "strangled to death," and so on.
2 The petty bourgeois in a frenzy may also want as much.
And this, in the main, is what our revolution did between October 1917 and February 1918.
But in my pamphlet I also mention what even the most revolu­ tionary petty bourgeois cannot want, but what every class conscious worker does want-what our revolution has not yet accompliehed.
But on this problem, the problem of tomorrow, Bukharin said nothing.
· · · And I have every reason not to be silent on this point.

tion to the problems of tomorrow, and not of yesterday, and, in the second place, my pamphlet was written before the Bolsheviks seized power, when it was impossible to entertain the Bolsheviks with vulgar, petty-bourgeois arguments such as: "Yes, of course, after seizing power, they begin to sing about discipline.

SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE ALL-RUSSIAN CONGRESS OF REPRESENTATIVES OF FINANCE DEPARTMENTS OF THE SOVIETS May 18, 1918 * (Brief Newspaper Report} LENIN began his speech by stating that the financial position of the country was undoubtedly critical.
In the course of the socialist trans· formation of society, he said, it is necessary to overcome a number of difficulties which often seem insurmountable.
But the tasks are such that they are worth taking trouble over and for the sake of them it is worth giving final battle to the bourgeoisie.
You know better than anyone else, said Lenin, the difficulties that have to be overcome in the transition from general assumptions and decrees to everyday life.
The work ahead will be very difficult because the resistance of the propertied classes will be desperate.
But the difficulties that lie ahead of us will be more than compensated for when we succeed in overcoming the resistance of the bourgeoisie and in subordinating it to the control of the Soviet government.
We must not forget that every radical reform we undertake will be doomed to failure unless we achieve success in our financial policy~ Success in this field will determine the success of the enormous work we have planned to transform society on socialist lines.
The fundamental financial tasks which the Soviet government has outlined must be immediately taken up, and consultation with you, people with practical experience, will only help to "make the changes we have planned something more than mere declarations.
We must at all cost achieve lasting :financial reform.
In the name of the Council of People's Commissars I submit for your considera· tion the taslq; which emerged from the numerous consi;iltations a,nd a12 Financial centralisation.
The speaker expressed the opinion that the complete separation of the localitie~ from the centre was quite natural.
He regarded this as the expression of the natural hatred and abhorrence the people felt towards the old system of centralisa­ tion that existed under the autocracy.
But the people, by their own experience, would come to rthe conclusion that democratic centralisa­ tion is necessary, because without it, it will be impossible to carry out the financial reforms which will give every citizen bread and a cultured life.
No matter how great the state of ruin may be when a local Soviet proceeds to create an independent republic, we must not fall into despair, for these difficulties are merely growing pains, which ;ire quite natural during the transition from tsarist Russia to the Russia of united Soviet organisations.
Introduction of an income and property tax.
I would ask you to take up this question as early as possible.
You know that all Social­ ists are opposed to indirect taxation, because the only proper system of taxation from the Socialist point of view is the graduated income an~ property tax.
" As I have said already, the resistance of the prop­ ertied classes will be desperate when this tax is introduced.
At present, thanks to their connections and the various dirty tricks they play, including bribery, they manage to evade this tax.
but we must adopt all measures to prevent them from doing so.
, We have outlined a number of measures in this field, the ground has been cleared for the foundations, for the edifice, but the founda­ tions have not yet been laid because some time is required to find the necessary workers to do it.
The time for this is now approaching.
The question of the income tax is such that mere decrees are in­ adequate for its introduction; practical measures and experience are required.
" i .
We are of the opinion that a monthly system of collecting the mcome tax must be adopted.
All measures must be taken to collect the income tax each month from persons obtaining incomes from the Treasury by deducting the tax from their salaries.
The income tax must be coltected from everybody without ex-ception, because managing with the aid of the printing press, as we have been doing up to now, can be justified only as a temporary expedient.
This transitional period has now come to an end, and we ~ust introduce the graduated property tax with very frequent collections.
I would ask you to work out this measure in a detailed and practical manner, and to draw up definite plans which we could quickly em­ body in decrees and instructions.
Referring to the question of contributions, Lenin said: I am not at all opposed to contributions, because I understand perfectly well that the proletariat could not dispense with them in the first period.
It is a proper measure for the transitional author­ ities to impose.
But the transitional period has now come to an end and we are about to introduce the centralised collection of a gradu­ ated income tax with very frequent collections.
Undoubtedly, the bourgeoisie will exert every effort to evade our laws and will resort to petty deception.
· We shall combat this in order completely to undermine the remnants of the bourgeoisie.
The introduction of compulsory labour service and raising of labour discipline.
The old capitalism, based on free trade and com· petition, has been greatly undermined by the war throughout Europe.
The war led to the introduction of compulsory labour service for the population in many countries.
In actual fact, however, it turned out that compulsory labour service was introduced only for the poor, because the rich could easily evade it.
We must introduce compulsory labour service primarily not for the poor, who even without that have brought sufficient sacrifices to the altar of war, but for the rich, who amassed wealth out of the war.
It is from this measure that we must start.
We must introduce workers' budget-tax books primarily for the rich· in order that it may be seen what share of work each performs for the purpose of saving his country.
Supervision will be exercised by the local Soviets.
In regard to the poor, this measure is at present superfluous, because they have quite enough work to do as it is; moreover, the trade unions are adopting all measures to increase productivity and to raise labour discipline.
serve as a preparatory measure for transferring the burden of tax­ ation to the rich, who, in fairness, should bear it.
The substitution of a new currencr for the present currency.
One of the results of the war has been an abundance of paper currency in all countries.
In the transition to socialism it is necessary to sub­ stitute other tokens of claim upon public wealth for the present money tokens.
Money, paper tokens-that which is now called money-has a corrupting influence and is _dangerous because the bourgeoisie, hoarding stocks of these paper tokens, remain in econ­ omic power.
We must take immediate measures t0 counteract this.
These measures are the introduction of the strictest registration of the amount of paper tokens in circulation by completely substi­ tuting new money for the present money.
Undoubtedly, great econ· omic and political difficulties lie in the path of introducing this measure.
Itcalls for careful prepar:ation, and we have already started on these preparations.
We shall fix a very short period of time during which everyone must declare the amount of money in his possession and receive new money in exchange for it.
If the sum is a small one, he will get a ruble for a ruble.
If the sum exceeds the fixed limit, he will get only a part.
Undoubtedly, this measure will meet with the strong resist­ ance, not only of the bourgeoisie, but also of our peasants who have become rich as a result of the war, and who have buried bottles filled with paper money in the ground.
We shall come face to face with the class enemy.
The struggle will be a severe one but a fruitful one.
There is no doubt among us.
about our having to take up the burden of the struggle, because it is necessary· and inevitable.
An enormous amount of preparatory work is required for the purpose of carrying out this measure: it is necessary to draw up a form of declaration, propaganda must be carried on in the local­ ities, the date on which the old money is to be exchanged for the new must be fixed, etc.
But we shall do all this.
This is the last and decisive battle with the bourgeoisie which will enable us to pay the debts to foreign capital-until the hour of the social revolution strikes in the West-and to carry out the necessary economic re­ forms in the country.
in which he expressed the conviction that the measures he had enumerated would meet with the sympathy of all those who held culture and the gains of the revolution dear, were greeted with loud and prolonged applause.
LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE CONFERENCE OF REPRESEN­ TATIVES OF NATIONALISED ENTERPRISES May 18, 1918 * HAVING heard the communication of the comrades elected by the workers' delegation at the conference of representatives of large metal works, and bearing in mind the resolution adopted by the conference, I am able to say that in my opinion the Council of People's Commissars will certainly be unanimously in favour of immediate nationalisation if the conference will exert every effort to secure planned and systematic organisation of work and in­ creased productivity.
Hence, it is desirable that the conference: 1) Immediately elect a Provisional Council to prepare for the amalgamation of the works; 2) Authorise the Central Committee of the Metal Workers' Union, in agreement with the Supreme Council of National Econ­ omy, to change their form and to add members to this Provisional Council for the purpose of transforming it into a Management Board of a single union (or amalgamation) of all the nationalised works; 3) Approve, or by means of a resolution legalise the factory ·regulations, on the model of the Briansk regulations, for the purpose of creating strict labour discipline; 4) Nominate candidates from among specialists, engineers and organisers of large-scale produc­ tion, for the purpose of participating in the management, or author­ ise the Supreme Council of National Economy to seek for and 8,p­ point such; 5) It is desirable that workers from the best organised works, or those having most experience in managing large-scale production, shall be sent (by the Provisional Council or by the Central Committee of the Metal Workers' Union) to assist in proper­ ly organising affairs at the less successful works; 6) By keeping the 384 materials and the productivity of labour, we must achieve, and we can achieve, enormous econom­ ies in raw materials and labour.
I think that if the conference and the bodies it sets up work ener­ getically, it will be possible for the Council of People's Commissars to pass the nationalisation decree within the next few days.
25 SPEECH DELIVERED AT THE FIRST CONGRESS OF COUN-CILS OF NATIONAL ECONOMY, MAY 26, 1918 ;c­ CoMRADEs, permit me first of all to greet the Congress of Councils of National Economy in the name of the Council of People's Com­ missars.
Comrades, upon the Supreme Council of National Economy now devolves a most difficult, but a most grateful task.
There is not the slightest doubt that the further the gains of the October Revolu­ tion progress, the more profound the change which it commenced becomes, the more firmly the gains of the socialist revolution become established and the socialist system becomes consolidated, the greater and higher will become the role of the Councils of National Economy, which alone of all the state institutions are destined to occupy a permanent place.
And this place will become all the more durable the more closely we approach the establishment of the socialist system and the less need there will be for a purely admin­ istrative apparatus, for an apparatus which is solely engaged in administration.
After the resistance of the exploiters has been finally broken, after the toilers have learned to organise socialist produc­ tion, this apparatus of administration in the proper, strict, narrow sense of the word, this apparatus of the old state, is doomed to die; while the apparatus of the type of the Supreme Council of National Economy is destined to grow, to develop and become strong, and to perform all the main activities of organised society.
That is why comrades, when I look back on the experience of our Supreme Council of National Economy and of the local Coun­ cils, with the activities of which it is closely and_ inseparably con­ nected, I think that in spite of much that is unfinished, incomplete, and unorganised, there is not the slightest ground for pessimistic conclusions.
For the task which the Supreme Council of National Economy sets itself, and the"Task which all the regional and local Very often-of course, from our point of view, perhaps too often­ the proverb "measure your cloth seven times before you cut it" is not applied.
Unfortunately, things are not so simple in regard to the organisation of economy on socialist lines as they are expressed in that proverb.
With the transition of all power-this time not only political and not even mainly political, but economic power, that is, power that affects the most deep-seated foundations of every­ day human existence--to a new class, and moreover to a class which for the first time in the history of humanity is the leader of the overwhelming majority of the population, of the whole mass of toilers and of the exploited-our tasks become more complicated.
It goes without saying that in view of the supreme importance and the supreme difficulty of the organisational tasks that confront us, when we must organise the most deep-seated foundations of the human existence of hundreds of millions of people on entirely new lines, it is impossible to proceed according to the proverb "measure your cloth seven times before you cut it.
" Indeed, we are not in a position to measure a thing innumerable times and then cut out and fix what has been finally measured and fitted.
We must build our economic edifice in the process of the work, trying out this or that institution, watching their work, testing them by the collective common experience of the toilers, and, above all, by the results of their work.
We must do this in the process of the work, and, moreover, in the midst of desperate struggles and the furious resistance of the exploiters, who become the more furious the nearer we come to the time when we can pull out the last bad teeth of capitalist exploitation.
It goes without saying that if even in a short space of time we have again and again to alter types, regulations and organs of administration in various branches of national economy, there is nothing in this that can give grounds for pessimism, although, of course, it may give considerable grounds for angry outbursts on the part of the bourgeoisie and Messieurs the exploiters, whose finest sentiments have been wounded.
Of course, those who take too close and too direct a part in this work do not find it 25* the rules, the norms and the laws of administration, say, of the Chief Water Board, three times; the pleasure obtained from work of this kind cannot be very great.
But if we abstract our­ selves somewhat from the direct unpleasantness of too frequent alteration of decrees, and if we look somewhat niore deeply and further into the enormous world-historical task that the Russian proletariat has to carry out with the aid of its as yet inadequate forces, it will become immediately clear that even a more frequent alteration and testing by experiment of various systems of ad­ ministration and various forms of discipline is inevitable.
In such a gigantic task, we could never claim, and not a single sensible Socialist who has ever written on the prospects of the future ever thought, that we could revise the forms of organisation of the new society according to a predetermined pattern, and at one stroke.
All we knew, all that the best experts on capitalist society, the best minds who foresaw the development of capitalist society, could tell us at all precisely was that this transformation was historically in­ evitable and would proceed along a certain main line, that private ownership of the means of production had been doomed by history, that it would burst, that the exploiters would inevitably be expro­ priated.
This was established with scientific precision, and we knew this when we grasped the banner of socialism, when we declared ourselves to be Socialists, when we formed Socialist parties, when we transformed society.
We knew this when we took power for the purpose of proceeding with socialist reorganisation; but we could not know the form this transformation would take, or the rate of development of the concrete reorganisation.
Collective experience, the experience of millions alone can give us decisive guidance in this respect; because, for the purposes of our task, for the purpose of building socia1ism, the experience of the hundreds and hundreds of thousands· who constitute the upper strata which have made his­ tory up to now in landlord society and in capitalist society was insufficient.
We cannot proceed in this way precisely because we rely on joint experience, on the experience of millions of toilers.
That is why we know that the work of organisation, which is the main and fundamental task of the Soviets, will inevitably entail a vast number of experiments, -a: vast number of steps, a vast her of alterations, a vast number of difficulties, particularly in regard to the question as to how to put people in their proper places; because we have no experience of this, here we have to devise every step ourselves, and the more serious the mistakes we make on this path, the more the certainty will grow that with every increase in the membership of the trade unions, with every addition­ al thousand, with every additional hundred thousand that come over from the camp of the toilers, of the exploited who have hitherto lived according to tradition and habit, inil:o the camp of the builders of Soviet organisations, the numh·er of people who answer to the re· quirements of the tasks and who will organise the work on proper lines wiJl grow.
Take one of the secondary tasks that the Supreme Council of National Economy particularly comes up against, the task of utilising bourgeois specialists.
We all know, at least those who stand on the basis of science and socialism know, that this task can be fulfilled only when and to the extent that intermitional cap­ italism has developed the material and technical prerequisites of labour organised on an enormous scale and based on the framework of science, and hence on the training of enormous cadres of scienti­ fically educated specialists.
We know that without this socialism is impossible.
If we peruse the works of those Socialists who have observed the development of capitalism during the last half cen· tury, and who again and again came to the conclusion that social-, ism is inevitable, we will find that all of them without exception pointed out that socialism alone would liberate science from its bourgeois fetters, from its enslavement to capitalism, from it;; slavery to the interests of frightful capitalist greed.
Socialism alone will make possible the wide expansion of social production and distribution on scientific lines and their actual subordination to the aim of easing the lives of the toilers and of improving their con­ ditions to the utmost extent.
Socialism alone can achieve this.
We know that it must achieve this, and in the understanding of this truth lies the difficulty and the strength of Mar:Xism.
We must achieve this while relying on elements which are op­ posed to it, because the bigger capital becomes the more the bour­ geoisie suppresses the workers.
Nnw that power is in the hands of the proletariat and the poo.
r peasants and the government is setting itself tasks with the support of these masses, we have to achieve these socialist changes with the help of bourgeois specialists who have been trained in bourgeois society, who know no other condi­ tions, who cannot conceive of any otHer social system.
Hence, even in those cases when these people are absolutely sincere and loyal to their work they are filled with thousands of bourgeois prejudices, they are connected by thousands of invisible ties with bourgeois society, which is dying and decaying and is therefore putting up furious resistance.
We cannot conceal these .
difficulties of the tasks and achievements from ourselves.
Of all the socialist authors who have written about this, I cannot recall the work of a single one, nor am I aware of the opinion of a single prominent Socialist pn future socialist society, which pointed to this concrete practical difficulty that would confront the working class when it took power, when it set itself the task of transforming the sum total of the rich, his­ torically inevitable and necessary store of culture and knowledge and technique from an instrument of capitalism into an instrument of socialism.
It is easy to do this in a general formula, in abstract contrasts; but in the struggle against capitalism, which does not die all at once but puts up increasingly furious resistance the closer death approaches, this task is one that calls for tremendous effort.
Experiments in this field, the repeated rectification of partial mis­ takes are inevitable because it is impossible, in this or that sphere of national economy, to transform specialists from servants of capitalism into the servants of the toiling masses, into their advisers, all at once.
The fact that we cannot do this all at once should not give rise to the slightest pessimism, because the task which we have set ourselves is a task of world-historical difficulty and significance.
We do not shut our eyes to the fact that in a single country, even if it were a much less backward country than Russia, even if we were living amidst better conditions than those prevailing after four years of unprecedented, painful, severe and ruinous war, we could not carry out the socialist revolution completely, solely by our own efforts.
He who turns away from the socialist revolution now taking place in Russia and points to the obvious lack of forces is like the conservative "man in a muffier" who cannot see further than his nose, who forgets that not a single historical change of any im-ber of cases.
Forces grow in the process of the struggle, m the course of the growth of the revolution.
When a country has taken the path of profound change it is to the credit of that country and the party of the working class which achieved victory in that country, that t1iey have taken up in a practical manner the tasks that were formerly raised abstractly, theoretically.
This experience will never be !or­ gotten.
The experience which the workers now united in trade umons and local organisations are acquiring in the practical work of organising the whole of production on a national sca~e cannot be lost no matter what vicissitudes the Russian revolut10n and the inte~national socialist revolution may pass through.
It has gone into history as a gain of socialism and on it the future international revolution will erect its socialist edifice.
Permit me to mention another problem, perhaps the most dif­ ficult problem that the Supreme Council of National Economy has now to solve in a practical manner, that is, the problem of labour discipline.
Properly speaking, in mentioning this problem, we ought to admit and emphasise with satisfaction that it was precisely the trade unions-their largest organisations, namely, the Central Com­ mittee of the Metal Workers' Union and the All-Russian Council of Trade Unions, the supreme trade union body, which unites mil­ lions of toilers-which were the first to set to work independently to solve this problem; and this problem is of world-historical im­ portance.
In order to understand it we must abstract ourselves from those partial minor failures, from the incredible difficulties which, if taken separately, seem to be insurmountable.
We must rise to a higher level and survey the historical change of systems of social economy.
Only from this angle will it be possible to appreciate the immensity of the task which we have undertaken.
Only then will it be possible to appreciate the enormous significance of the fact that on this occasion, the most advanced representatives of society, namely, the toiling and exploited masses, are, on their own initiative, setting to work to solve the problem which hitherto, in feudal Russia, up to 1861, was solved by a handful of landlords who regarded it as their special function.
At that time it was their function to create national connections and discipline.
We know how the feudal land-credible torments of penal servitude for the majority of the people.
Recall the transition from serfdom to bourgeois economy.
From all that you have witnessed-although the majority of you could not have witnessed it-and from all that you have .
learned from the older generation, you know how comparatively easy, historically, was the transition to the new bourgeois economy after 1861, the transition from the old feudal discipline of the stick, from the dis­ cipline of senseless, arrogant and brutal insqlt and violence against the person, to bourgeois discipline, to the discipline of starvation, io so-called free hire, which in fact was the discipline of capitalist slavery.
This was because mankind passed from one exploiter to another; because one minority of plunderers and exploiters of the labour of the people gave way to another minority who were also plunderers and exploiters of the labour of the people; because the landlords gave way to the capitalists, one minority gave way to another minority, while the broad masses of the toilers and the exploited classes were oppressed.
And even this change from one _exploiter's discipline to another exploiter's discipline took years, if not ~ecades, of effort; it extended over a transition period of years, if not decades.
During this period the old feudal landlords quite sincerely believed that everything was going to rack and ruin that it was impossible to manage the country without serfdom; whil; the new capitalist master encountered practical difficulties at every step a_nd g~ve up his enterprise in disgust.
The material sign, the material evidence of the difficulties of this transition was the fact that Russia at that time imported machinery from abroad in order to e_mploy the best equipment, and it turned out that no people were available to handle these machines, and there were no managers .
.
And all over_ Russia one could see excellent machinery lying around unused, so difficult was the transition from the old feudal discipline to the new bourgeois capitalist discipline.
· .
And so, comrades, if you look at the matter from this angle, you will not allow yourselves to be misled by those people, by those ?lasses, by th~ bourgeoisie and their hangers-on, whose sole task is to sow pamc, to cause despondency, to cause complete despon­ dency concerning the whole of-our work, to make it appear to be I as if there was ever in the world, in history, a single really great revo'lution in which there was no corruption, no loss of discipline, no painful steps of experiment when the masses were creating a ne~ discipline.
We must not forget that this is the first time that this preliminary turning point in history has been reached, when a new discipline, labour discipline, the discipline of comradely contact, Soviet discipline, is being created by millions of toilers· and ex­ ploited.
We do not claim, nor do we expect quick successes in this field.
We know that this task will take up an entire historical epoch.
We have begun this historical epcch, an epoch in which we are breaking up the discipline of capitalist society in a country which is still bourgeois, and we are proud of the fact that all the class conscious workers, absolutely all the toiling peasants are every­ where helping this destruction; an epoch in which the masses volun­ tarily, on their ,own initiative, are becoming imbued with the con­ viction that they must-not on instructions from above, but on the instructions of their own living experience-change this discipline which is based on the exploitation and slavery of the toilers into the new discipline of united labour, the discipline of the united organ­ ised workers and toiling peasants of the whole of Russia, of a land with a population of scores of millions, over a hundred million.
This is a task of enormous difficulty, but it is a grateful one, because only when we have fulfilled it in practice shall we have driven the last nail into the coffin of capitalist society which we are burying.
THE FOURTH CONFERENCE OF TRADE UNIONS AND FACTORY COMMITTEES OF MOSCOW REPORT ON THE PRESENT SITUATION, JUNE 27, 1918 * COMRADES, you all know, of course, of the great disaster that has befallen our country, namely, famine.
Before discussing the meas­ ures to be adopted to combat this disaster, which has now become ' more acute than ever, we must first of all discuss its main causes.
In discussing this question we must say and bear in mind that this disaster has not only befallen Russia, but all, even the most cul-tured, advanced and civilised countries.
.
, In Russia, where th~ overwhelming majority of the peasantry were disunited and oppressed by the yoke of the tsars, the landlords and capitalists, famine more than once affected whole regions of our agrarian country in past decades.
And it has affected us par­ ticularly now, during the revolution.
But this disaster reigns also in the West European countries.
Many of these countries have not known what famine is for decades and even centuries, so highly was agriculture developed there, and to such an extent were those European countries which could not produce a sufficient supply of grain of their own assured of an enormous quantity of imported grain.
But now, in the twentieth century, side by side with still greater progress in technology, side by side with wonderful inven­ tions, side by side with the wide application of machinery and eleCtricity, of modern internal combustion engines in agriculture, side by side with all this we now see this same disaster of famine advancing upon the people in all European countries without exception.
It would seem that with civilisation, with culture, the countries are once again returning to primitive barbarism, are again experiencing a situation when morals deteriorate and people become savage in the struggle fur a crust of bread.
What has caused majority of them? We all know that it ~as caused.
by the impenahst war by the war which has been torturmg humamty for four years, the 'war which has already cost the peoples more, far more tha~ ten million young lives, the war which was called forth ~y the ~vance of the capitalists, the war which is being waged to decide which of the great robbers-the British or the German~shall rule the world, acquire colonies and strangle the small nat10ns.
This war, which has affected almost the whole of the glo?e, which has destroyed not less than ten million lives, ~ot ~ountm.
g the millions of maimed, crippled and sick, the war which, m addi­ tion, has torn millions of the healthiest and best forces from produc­ tive labour-this war has reduced humanity to a state of absolute barbarism.
What numerous Socialist writers foresaw as the worst, most painful and severest end of capitalism has come to pass.
They said: capitalist society based on the private ownership of the land, the factories and tools by a handful of capitalists, of monopolists, will be transformed into socialist society, which alone is capable h " .
·1· d " " It d" .
of putting an end to war, because t e c1v1 ise , cu ure .
cap:· talist world is heading for unprecedented bankruptcy, which is capable of undermining and will inevitably und.
ermine all t~e foundations of cultured life.
I repeat, we see famme not only m Russia but in the most cultured, advanced countries, like Germany, where 'the productivity of labour is incomparably greater, which can supply the world with more than a sufficiency of technical ap­ pliances, and which, still maintaining free intercourse with remote countries, can supply her population with food.
The f~mine the:e is better "organised," it is spread over a longer penod than m Russia, but it is famine nevertheless, still more severe and more painful than here.
Capitalism has l~d to such a severe and painful disaster that it is now perfectly clear to all that the present war cannot end without a number of severe and very bloody revolutions, of which the Russian revolution was only the first, only the be­ ginning.
You have now received news to the effect that in Vienna, for example, Councils of Workers' Deputies have been established for the second time,'k and for the second time the toiling population have come out on an almost general mass strike.
We hear that in cities like Berlin, which up to now have been models of capitalist order, culture and civilisation, it is becoming dangerous to go out into the street after dark, because, in spite of the very severe measures and the very strict guard that is kept, the war and famine have reduced people to such a state of absolute savagery, have led to such anarchy, have roused such anger, that not merely the sale, but downright looting, an actual war for a crust of bread, is becoming the order of the day in all cultured civilised countries.
Hence, comrades, since a painful and difficult situation has been created in our country as a consequence of -the famine, we must explain to the few but nevertheless still existing absolutely blind and ignorant people the fundamental and principal causes of the famine.
We can still meet people in our country who argue in this way: under the tsar we had bread; the revolution came and there is no bread.
Naturally, it is quite possible that for some old village women the development of history during the past ten years is summed up entirely by the fact that formerly there was bread and now there is none.
This is comprehensible, because famine is a disaster which sweeps away all other questions, which takes its place at the cornerstone, and overshadows everything else.
But it goes without saying that our task, the task of the class conscious workers, is to explain to the broad masses, to explain to all the rep­ resentatives of the toiling masses in town and country the principal cause of the famine; for unless we explain this we shall not be able to create a proper attitude either among ourselves or among the representatives of the toiling masses, we shall not be able to create a proper understanding of its harmfulness and we shall not be able to create that firm determination and temper that is required to combat this disaster.
If we remember that this disaster was caused by the imperialist war, that today even the richest countries are experiencing unprecedented hunger and that the over­ whelming majority of the toiling masses are suffering incredible torture; if we remember that for four years already this imperialist war has been compelling the workers of the various countries to shed their blood for the benefit of the greedy capitalists, and if we remember that the longer the war lasts, the fewer become the ways gigantic, immense forces will have to be set moving.
The war has lasted nearly four years.
Russia came out of the war, and owing to the fact that she came out of the war alone she found herself between two gangs of imperialist pirates, each of which is clutching at her, strangling her and taking advantage of her temporary defencelessness and disarmament.
The war has al­ ready lasted four years.
The German imperialist pirates have achieved a number of victories and continue to deceive their work­ ers, a section of whom, bribed by the bourgeoisie, have deserted to the side of the German imperialists and continue to repeat the despicable lie about the defence of the fatherland when as a matter of fact the German soldiers are defending the selfish predatory interests of the German capitalists who promised them that Germany will bring peace and prosperity.
Actually we see that the more extensive Germany's victories become the more the hopelessness of her position becomes revealed.
When the violent exploiters' Brest Peace, a peace based upon violence and the oppression of peoples, was signed, Germany, the German capitalists boasted that they would give the workers bread and peace.
But now they are reducing the.
bread ration in Germany.
It is universally admitted that the food campaign in the rich Ukraine was a failure.
* In Austria the situation has reached a stage of hunger riots, of national mass outbursts of anger,1 because the more Ger­ many is victorious the clearer it becomes to all, even to many representatives of the big bourgeoisie in Germany, that the war is hopeless.
They are beginning to realise that even if the Germans are able to maintain their resistance on the Western front it will not bring the end of the war a bit nearer but will create another enslaved country which will have to he occupied by German troops and make it necessary to continue the war; and this will lead to the disintegration of the German army, which is being transformed from an army into gangs of looters violating alien.
peoples, unarmed peoples, and extracting from the country the last remnants of food supplies and raw materials in the face of the tremendous resistance 1 See note to p.

------------England and America, which are far more developed t~an she ~_s, which have greater productive forces,' which find the time to dis­ patch tens of thousands of the best new forces to Europe, and to transform all their machines, factories and works into instruments of destruction.
The war is receiving fresh fuel, and that means that every year, nay every month, sees the further extension of this "":a~.
There is no other way out of this war except ~evolution, except c1v1l war, except the transformation of the war between ca~italists for profits, for the distribution of the loot, for the strangulat10n of sm.
all countries, into a war of the oppressed against the oppressors, which is the only war which always accompanies not only war but every serious revolutioti in history; it is the only war that is legitimate and just, a holy war from the point of view of the interests of the toilers, of the oppressed and of the exploited masses.
Without euch a war there can be no liberation from imperialist slavery.
We must be perfectly clear in our minds about the new disasters that civil war brings for every country.
The more cultured a country is the more serious will be these disasters.
Let us picture to ourselves a country equipped with machinery and railways in which civil war is raging, and this civil war cuts off communication between the various parts of the country.
Picture to yourselves the condition of regions which for tens of years have been accustomed to living by the interchange of manufactured goods and you will understand that every civil war brings fresh disasters, which the great Socialists foresaw.
The imperialists are dooming the working class to disaster, s!lffering and extinction.
Burdensome and painful as all this may be for the whole of mankind, it is becoming clearer and clearer every day to the new socialist society that the imperialists will not be able to put an end to the war which they started; other classes will end it-the working class, which in all countries is becoming more and more active every day, which is expressing its anger and indigna­ tion and which, irrespective of sentiments and moods, the force of circumstances is compelling to overthrow the rule of the capitalists.
We in Russia, which is particularly affected by the disaster of famine, are passing through a-period more difficult than has ever den of the Russian revolution lies in that it was much easier for the Russian revolutionary working class to start than it was for the West European classes, but it is much more difficult for us to con­ tinue.
It is more difficult to start revolutions in West European countries because there the revolutionary proletariat is opposed ·by the highest minds of culture, while the working class is in a state of cultural slavery.
Meanwhile, by the very force of our international position, we must pass through an incredibly difficult time, and we representa­ tives of the toiling masses, we workers, class conscious workers, in all our agitation and propaganda, in every speech we deliver, in every appeal we issue, in our talks in the factories and at every meeting with peasants, must explain that the disaster that has be­ fallen us is an international disaster and that there is no other way out of it except international revolution.
Since we must pass through such a painful period in which we temporarily stand alone, we must exert all our efforts to bear the difficulties of this period staunchly, knowing that in the last analysis we are not alone, that the disaster which we are experiencing is creeping upon every Euro­ pean country, and that not one of these countries will be able to extricate itself from it except by a series of revolutions.
Russia has been afflicted by famine which has been made more acute by the fact that the violent peace has deprived her of the most fertile grain-bearing gubernias, and it has also been made more acute by the fact that the old food campaign is drawing to a close.
We still have several weeks to go before the next harvest, which is undoubtedly a rich one; and these few weeks will be a very difficult period of transition which, being a difficult one generally, is ren­ dered still more acute by the fact that in Russia the deposed exploit­ ing classes of landlords and capitalists are doing all they can, are exerting every effort, to restore their power.
This is one of the main reasons why it is precisely the grain-bearing gubernias of Siberia which are cut off from us as a result of the Czecho-S!ovak ri:mtiny.

ants, that they do not want to fight against Russia and against the Russian Soviet government, that they'only want to make their way by force of arms to the frontier.
But at their head stand yesterday's generals, landlords and capitalists who are financed with Anglo­ French money and enjoy the support of Russian social-traitors who have deserted to the side of the bourgeoisie.
The whole of this gang is taking advantage of the famine to make another attempt to restore the landlords and the capitalists to power.
Comrades, the experience of our revolution confirms the correctness of the words which always distinguish the representatives of sci­ entific socialism, Marx and his followers, from the utopian social­ ists, from the petty-bourgeois socialists, from the socialist intel­ lectuals and from the socialist dreamers.
The intellectual dreamers, the petty-bourgeois socialists, thought, and perhaps still think, dream, that it is possible to introduce socialism by persuasion.
They think that the majority of the people.
will be convinced, and when they become convinced the minority will obey; that the majority will vote and socialism will be introduced.
No, the world is not built so happily; the exploiters, the brutal landlords, the capitalist class are not amenable to persuasion.
The socialist revolution con· firms what everybody has seen-the furious resistance of the exploiters.
The stronger the pressure of the oppressed classes be­ comes, the nearer they come to overthrowing all oppression, all exploitation, the more determinedly the oppressed peasantry and the oppressed workers display initiative, the more furious does ·the resistance of the exploiters become.
We are passing through a very severe and very painful period of transition from capitalism to socialism, a period which will inevitably be a very long one in all countries because, I repeat, the oppressors retaliate to every success achieved by the oppressed class by fresh attempts at resistance, by attempts to overthrow the power of the oppressed class.
The Czecho-Slovak mutiny, which is obvious­ ly being supported by Anglo-French imperialism in the pursuit of its policy of overthrowing the Soviet government, illustrates what this resistance can be.
we see-'how this mutiny is arly well; every one of you sees this in the factories) who are not enlightened socialists and cannot be such because they have to .
slave in the factories and they have neither the time nor the opportunity to become socialists.
It goes without saying that these people begin to sympathise when they see the workers rising in the factory, when they see that these workers obtain the opportunity to learn the art of managing factories-a difficult and hard task in which mistakes are inevitable, but which is the only task in which the workers can at last realise their constant striving to make the machines, the fac­ tories, the works, the best of modern technique, the best achieve­ ments of humanity serve not purposes of exploitation, but the purpose of improving and easing the lives of the overwhelming majority.
But when they see the imperialist pirates in the West, in the North and in the East taking advantage of Russia's defenceless· ness to crush her soul, and since they do not know what the situation in the labour movement is in other countries, of course they are guided by despair.
Nor can it be otherwise.
It would be ridiculous to expect and foolish to think that capitalist society based on ex· ploitation could at one stroke create the complete appreciation and understanding of the need for socialism.
This cannot· be.
This ap­ preciation comes only at the end of the struggle which has to be waged in this painful period, in which one revolution has broken out before the rest and gets no assistance from the others, and when famine approaches.
Naturally, certain strata of the toilers are in­ evitably overcome by despair and indignation and turn away in disgust from everything.
Naturally, the counter-revolutionaries, the landlords and capitalists, and their protectors and henchmen, take advantage of this situation for the purpose of launching attack after attack upon the socialist government.
We see what this has led to in all the towns where no assistance was given by foreign bayonets.
We know that it was possible to defeat the Soviet government only when those people who had shouted so much about defending the fatherland and about their patriotism revealed their capitalist nature and concluded agree· ments, one day with the German bayonets in order jointly with them 26 to massacre the Ukrainian Bolsheviks, the next day with the Turkish bayonets in order to march against the Bolsheviks, the day after t~at with the Czecho-Slovak bayonets in order to overthrow the Soviet government and massacre the Bolsheviks in Samara.
Foreign.
aid alone, the aid of foreign bayonets alone, the betrayal of Russia to Japanese German and Turkish bayonets alone, have up to now given so:Ue show of success to those.
who have compromised with the capitalists and the landlords.
But we know that when rebell.
ions of this sort ·broke out as a result of the starvation and the despair of the masses in districts where the aid of foreign bayonets could not be obtained, as was the case in Saratov, Koslov and Tambov, the rule of the landlords, the capitalists and their friends who camou­ flaged themselves with the beautiful slogans of the Constituent ~s­ sembly lasted not more than days, if not hours.
The ~urther th~ umts of the Soviet army were from the centre temporarily occupied by the counter-revolution, the more determined was the movement among the urban workers, the more these workers and peasants displayed initiative in marching to the aid of Saratov, Penza and Koslov and in immediately overthrowing the rule of the counter­ revolution which had been established.
Comrades, if you examine these events from the point of view of all that is taking place in world history, if you bear in mind that your task, our common task, is to explain to ourselves and to explain to the masses that these great disasters have not befallen us accidentally, but first as a result of the imperialist war, and secondly as a result of the furious resistance of the landlords, the capitalists and the exploiters, if we are clear about this we can be certain that, however difficult it may be, the full appreciation of this will sink deeper and deeper into the minds of the broad masses and we shall succeed in creating discipline, in overcoming the indisci­ pline in our factories, and in helping the people to live through this painful and particularly difficult period, which perhaps will last the month or two, the few weeks that still remain until the new · harvest.
You know that as a consequence of the Czecho-Slovak counter­ revolutionary mutiny which has cut us off from Siberia, as a· con­ sequence of the continuous-unrest in the South, and as a consequence hut it goes without saying that the more difficult the position of the country in which famine is approaching, the more determined and firm must be the measures that we adopt to combat this famine.
One of the principal measures to combat the famine is the establish­ ment of the grain monopoly.
In this connection you will know per­ fectly well from your own experience that the kulaks, the rich, are raising a howl against the grain monopoly at every step.
This can be understood,.
because in those places where the grain monopoly was temporarily abolished, as Skoropadsky abolished it in Kiev, profiteering reached unprecedented dimensions, there the price of a pood 1 of grain rose to two hundred rubles.
Naturally, when there is a shortage of goods without which it is impossible to live, the owners of such goods can become rich, prices rise to unprecedented heights.
Naturally, the horror, the panic created by the fear of death from starvation forced prices up to unprecedented heights, and in Kiev they had to think of restoring the monopoly.
Here in Russia, long ago, even before the Bolsheviks came into power, notwith­ standing the wealth of grain that Russia possessed, the government became convinced of the necessity of introducing the grain mono­ poly.
Only those who are absolutely ignorant, or who have deliber­ ately sold themselves to the interests of the money-hags, can be opposed to it.
But, comrades, when we speak of the grain monopoly we must think of the enormous difficulties of realisation that are contained in this phrase.
It is quite easy to say grain monopoly, but we must ponder over what this phrase means.
It means that all surplus grain belongs to the state; it means that every single pood of grain over and above that required by the peasant for his farm, over and above that requir~d to maintain his family and cattle and for sowing, that every extra pood of grain must be taken by the state.
How is this to be done? The state must fix prices; every surplus pood of grain must be found and brought in.
How can the peasant, whose mind has been stultified for hundreds of years, who has been robbed and beaten to stupefaction by the landlords and ~apitalists who never allowed hi:rri to eat his fill, how can this peasant learn to appreciate .
1 One pood equals about 36 pounds.

a few weeks or a few months what the grain monopoly means? How can millions of people who up to now have kn01n1 the state only by its oppression, its violence, by the tyranny_ and robbery of the government_ officials, how can these peasants, living in remot~ villages and doomed to ruin, be made to understand what the rule of the workers and peasants means, be made to understand that power is in the hands of the poor, that to hoard grain, that to possess surplus grain and not hand it over to the state is a crime, and that those who hoard surplus grain are robbers, exploiters and guilty of causing terrible starvation among the workers of Petro­ grad, Moscow, etc.
? How can the peasant understand these things considering that up to now he has been kept in ignorance and that the only thing he was concerned with in the village was to sell his grain? How can he understand these things? It is not surprising that when we examine this question more closely, from the point of view of practical life, we realise what an enormously difficult task it is to introduce a grain monopoly in a country in which tsarism and the landlords held the majority of the peasants in ignorance, in a country in which the peasantry have sown grain on their own land for the first time in many centuries.
But the more difficult this task is, the greater it appears to be after close and careful study, the more clearly must we say to our­ selves what we have always said, namely, that the emancipation of the workers must be the work of the workers themselves.
We.
have always said: the emancipation of the toilers from oppression cannot be brought from outside; the toilers themselves, by their struggle, by their movement, by their agitation must learn to solve the new historical problem; and the more difficult, the greater, the more responsible the new historical problem is, the larger must be the number of those enlisted for the purpose of taking an independent part in solving it.
No class consciousness, no organisation is re­ quired to sell grain to a merchant, to a trader.
To do that one must live as the bourgeoisie has ordered.
One must merely be an obedient slave and picture to oneself and admit that the world as built bv the bourgeoisie is magnificent.
But in order to overcome capitali~t .
::haos, in order to introduce the_grain monopoly, in order to ensure that every surplus pood of grain is transferred to the state, pro-There are such people in the Russian countryside.
A maionty of the peasants belong to the category of Llie very poor and poor peasants who are not in a position to trade in g~ain surpluses a~d become robbers hoarding perhaps hundreds oi poods of gram while others are starving.
But today, the situation is that a peasant will perhaps call himself a toiling peasant (some people like this term very much) ; but if such a peasant has by his own labour, even without the aid of hired labour, gathered hundreds of poods of grain and calculates that if he .
holds this grain he will be able to s~~l it to a profiteer, or to a starvmg urban worker who has co~e w1tn his starving family, not for six rubles per pood but for two hundred rubles, such a peasant, who hoards hundreds of poods of grain in order to raise the price and get even a hundred rubles a pood, cannot be called a toiling peasant, he becomes transformed into an exploiter, into worse than a TObber.
What must we do under these circumstances? Whom can we rely upon in our struggle? We -know that the Soviet revolution and the Soviet government differ from other revolutions and other governments not only by the fact that they have overthrown the power of the landlords and the capitalists, that they have destroyed the feudal state, the autocracy, but also by the fact that the masses have rebelled against all the officials and created a new state in which power must belong to the workers and peasants, not only must, but already belongs to them.
In t~is state there are no police, no officials and no standing army which had been kept in barracks for many years isolated from the people and :trained to shoot the people.
We place arms in the hands of the workers and peasants who must learn the art of war.
There are units who give way to tempta­ tion vice and crime because they are not separated as by a Chinese wall from the world of oppression, from the world of starvation, in which the well-fed trv to enrich themselves because they are well­ fed.
That is why very ~ften we see detachments of class conscious workers leaving Petrograd and Moscow and on reaching the district to which they were sent going astray and becoming criminals.
We see the J/01,ugeoisie ~~§lpping th!'Jir h~nds i11 (lelight itnd filling thfl private capitalists would behave!" No, thank you, Messieurs the bourgeoisie! You will not frighten us.
You know very well that recovery from the misfortunes -and ulcers of the capitalist world will not come all at once.
And we know that recovery will come only in the midst of struggle; we will expose every incident of this kind, not to provide material for the counter-revolutionary Mensheviks and Cadets to smile and gloat over, but in order to teach the broad masses of the people.
Since our detachments do not fulfil their duties properly, give us more loyal and class conscious detachments far exceeding the number of those who gave way to temptation.
These must be organised and educated; non-class-conscious, exploited and starving toilers must be united around every class conscious worker.
The rural poor must be roused, educated and shown that the Soviet government will do all it possibly can to help them, so as to carry out the grain monopoly.
And so, when we approached this task, when the Soviet government definitely raised these questions, it said: comrades, workers, organ­ ise, organise food detachments, combat every case in which these detachments show that they are not equal to their duties, organise more strongly and rectify your mistakes, organise the village poor around yourselves! The kulaks lmow that their last hour has struck, that their enemy is advancing not merely with sermons, words and phrases, but with the organised village poor; and if we succeed in organising the village poor we shall vanquish the kulaks.
The kulaks know that the hour of the last, most determined, most des­ perate battle for socialism is approaching.
This struggle seems to he only a struggle for bread, hul as a matter of fact it is a struggle for socialjsm.
H the workers learn to solve these problems independent­ ly-for no one will come to their aid-if they learn to unite the village poor around themselves, they will achieve victory, they will have bread and the proper distribution of bread, thev wiH even have the proper distribution of labour, because by distributing labour properly we sh<tll be supreme fo all spheres Qf Jqbour! in ?Il sph~rn!'! o F industry.
· · at six rubles per pood, but they sell grain to a poor peasant neighbour at three rubles per pood and say to him: "You can go to a profit­ eer and sell at forty rubles per pood.
Our interests are the san:e; we must unite against the state which is robbing us.
It wants to ~IVe us six rubles per pood; here, take three poods, you can make_ sixty rubles.
you need not worry about h.
ow much I make, that is my business.
" .
I know that on these grounds armed conflicts with the peasants repeatedly occur, while the enemies of the Soviet government gl~at over it and snigger, and exert every effort to overthrow the Soviet government.
But we say: "That is because the food detachments that were sent were not sufficiently class conscious; but the lar~er the detachments were the more frequently we had c~ses-:nd t~is hap­ pened repeatedly-when the peasants gave their gram without a single case of violence, because class conscious ~orkers understand that their main strength lies, not in violence, but m the fact that they are the representatives of the organised and ~nlightened poor where­ as in the rural districts there is a mass of i~oran~e, th~ poor are not enlightened.
If the latter are approached m an i~telhgent n_ian­ ner, if they are told in plain language, without bookish _words, m ~ plain human way, that in Petrograd and Moscow'.
and m ~cores o uyezds where people are starving, where typhus ~s spreadmg as a result of famine, that tens of thousands of Russ~an peasant~ and workers are dying of starvation, that it was the :ich who un1ustly hoarded grain and made profit out of the starvat10n of the peop~e, it will be possible to organise the Roor and get the surplus _gram ollected not bv violence but by the organisation of the village ;oor.
I frequen~ly receive complaints about the kulaks from com~ rades who have gone to the villages with food ~etachments and who have fought against the counter-revolution.
I w1~l quote an exa:ple of which I have a particularly lively recollect10n because I hvard it yesterday, of something that occurred in the Ebtz Uyezd.
In that uyezd a Soviet of Workers' Deputies was set up, and there are a forge number of class conscious workers and poor peasants there.
Thanks to th.
is, j~ wais possible to consolidate the pow~r qf ~h~ poo:i:.
what.
But what they said was confirmed by comrades who had been sent especially from Moscow to other gubernias.
They said that the manner in which they had organised their work in Eletz was only to be welcomed, and confirmed the fact that in Russia there were uyezds where the Soviets were equal to their tasks and had suc­ ceeded in completely removing the kulaks and exploiters from the Soviets, in organising the toilers, in organising the poor.
Let those who use their wealth for profit clear out of the Soviet state organ-J isations! After they had expelled the kulaks they went to the town of Eletz, a trading town.
They did not wait for a decree to introduce the grain monopoly but remembered that the Soviets represent a · government that is close to the people and that every person, if he is a revolutionary, if he is a socialist and is really on the side of the • toilers, must act quickly and decisively.
They organised all the workers and poor peasants and formed so many detachments that searches were made all over Eletz.
They allowed only the trusted and responsible leaders of the detachments to enter the houses.
Not a single person of whom they were not certain was allowed to enter the houses, for they knew how often vacillation occurs and that nothing disgraces the Soviet government so much as these cases of robbery committed by unworthy representatives and servants of the Soviet government.
They succeeded in collecting a huge quantity of surplus grain and there was not a single house in commercial Eletz in which the bourgeoisie could make any profit by profiteering.
Of course, I know that it is much easier to do this in a small town than in a city like Moscow, but it must not be forgotten that not a · single uyezd town possesses the proletarian forces that Moscow has .
.
In Tambov, recently, the counter-revolution was victorious for I several hours.
It even published one issue of a Menshevik and Right ;ociahf"st-ReCvolut~itonartyAnewspbalperf whihch called for the convoca-• , , 10n o a ons 1 uen ssem y, or t e overthrow of the Soviet government and declared that the victory of the new government was permanent.
But Red Army men and peasants arrived from the sur­ roµrn:Ji!),~ country and in one day nia-a gubernia of enormous dimensions.
Its northern uyezds are in the non-agricultural zone, but its southern uyezds are extra· ordinarily fertile.
There they gather very big harvests and there are many peasants who have surpl.
us grain.
There one must be able to act energetically and have a particularly firm and clear apprecia· tion of the necessity of relying on the poor peasants in order to fight the kulaks.
There the kulaks are hostile to eYery sort of workers' and peasants' government and our people must wait for the assistance of the Petrograd and Moscow workers who, on every occasion, armed with the weapon of organisation, expel the kulaks from the Soviets, organise the poor and jointly with the local peasants ac· quire experience in fighting for the state monopoly of grain, ex­ perience in organising the rural poor and urban toilers in such a way as will guarantee us final and complete victory.
I quoted these examples to illustrate the food situation, comrades, because it seems to me that from the point of view of the toilers, for us, for the work· ers, it is not the statistical estimate of the amount of grain, of how ___ _ many million poods we can obtain that is important for the char· acterisation of the fight against the kulaks for bread.
I leave it to the food specialists to draw up these statistics.
I must say that if we succeed in securing the surplus grain from the gubernias ad· jacent to the Moscow non-agricultural zone and from fertile Siberia, right now, during the few severe weeks that remain until the new harvest, we shall have enough grain to save the non-agricultural gubernias from starvation.
In order to do that we must organise a still larger number of class conscious, advanced workers.
This was the.
main lesson to be learner:l from all preceding revolutions, and it is the main lesson to be learned from our revolution.
The better we are organised, the more widely good organisation manifests itself, the more the workers in the factories and works understand that their strength lies entirely in their organisation and in that of the village poor, the more certain shall we be of victory in the struggle against famine and in the struggle for socialism.
For, I repeat, our task is not to invent a new form of government but to roµse, to edl!cate and to organise every :representative of the villagG not be difficult for a few class conscious urban workers, Petrograd and Moscow workers, to explain, even in remote villages, that it is unjust to hoard grain, to profiteer in grain, to use it for making vodka, when hundreds of thousands a're dying in Moscow.
In order to do that, the workers of Petrograd and Moscow, and partic­ ularly you, comrades, the representatives of the most varied trades, factories and works, must thoroughly understand that no one will come to your assistance, that from other classi;es you can expect, not assistants but enemies, that the Soviet government has no loyal intelligentsia at its service.
The intelligentsia~are using their ex­ perience and knowledge--the highest human achievement-in the service of the exploiters, and are doing all they can to prevent our gaining victory over the exploiters; but even if hundreds of thous­ ands die of starvation, that will not break the resistance of the toilers.
We have no one to depend upon but the class with which we achieved the revolution and with which we shall overcome the very greatest difficulties, cross the very difficult zone that lies ahead of " us--and that is the factory workers, the urban and rural proletariat, who speak to each other in a language they all understand, who in town and country will vanquish all our enemies-·the kulaks and the rich.
But in order to achieve this we must remember the fundamental postulate of the socialist revolution which the workers so often for­ get, and that is, that in order to make a socialist revolution, in order to bring it about, in order to liberate the people from oppression, it is necessary immediately to abolish classes; the most class con­ scious and organised workers must take power in their hands.
The workers must become the.
ruling class in the state.
That is the truth which the majority of you have read in The Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels, which was written more than seventy years ago, and which has been translated into all languages and circulated in all countries.
Everywhere the truth has been revealed that in order to vanquish the capitalists it is necessary during the struggle against exploitation, while it is still dark, while people do not yet believe in the new system, that the organised urban factory workers become ~he ruling clas!'(, When.
you gather tog!:lther in your you, in your faetory committees; merely concern yoursel".
es with workers' technical ~r purely financial interests.
The workers and the oppressed classes have managed to seize power more than once, but never· have they been able to retain it.
For this purpose it is not only necessary for the workers to be able to rise in heroic struggle and overthrow ex· ploitation; they must also be able to organise, to maintain discipline, to be staunch, to calmly discuss affairs when everything is tottering, wh<';.
n you are being attacked, when innumerable stupid rumours are being spread-it is at such a time that the factory committees, which in all things are closely connected with the vast masses, are faced with the great political task of becoming primarily an organ of administration of political life.
The fundamental political problem that faces the Soviet government is that of securing the proper dis­ tribution of grain.
Although Eletz succeeded in bridling the local bourgeoisie, it is much more difficult to do this in Moscow; but here we hav~ incomparably better organisation, and here you can easily find tens of thousands of honest people whom your Party and your trade unions will supply and answer for, who will be able to lead the detachments with every certainty that they will remain ideol­ ogically loyal in spite of all difficulties, in spite of all temptatiOns and in spite of the torments of hunger.
No other class could under­ take this task at the present time, no other class would be able to lead the people who often fall into despair; there is no other class but the urban factory proletariat that can do this.
your factory committees must cease to be merely factory committees, they.
must become the fundamental state nuclei of the ruling class.
Your organ­ isation, your solidarity, your energy will determine whether we shall hold out in this severe transitional period as staunchly as a Soviet government should hold out.
Take up this work yourselves, take it up from every side, expose abuses every day.
Rectify every mistake that is committed with your own experience-many mis­ takes are committed today because the working class is still inexpe· rienced, hut the important thing is that it should itself take up this work mid rectify its own mistakes.
If we act.
in this way, if every revolution in the world-then we shall achieve socialism for the whole world! SPEECH IN REPLY TO THE DEBATE ON THE PRESENT SITUATION JUNE 28, 1918 Comrades, permit me first of all to deal with several of the pro­ positions advanced in opposition to me by the co-reporter Paderin.
From the stenographic report I note that he said: "We must do everything possible to enable primarily the English and Ger~an proletariat to come out against their oppressors.
What must be done for this? Is it our business to help these oppressors? By rousing enmity among ourselves, by destroying and weakening the coun­ try, we infinitely strengthen the position of the imperialists, British, French and German; who in the last resort will unite in order to strangle the working class of Russia.
" This argument shows how irresolute the Mensheviks were in their struggle against and in their opposition to imperialist war, because the argument I have just quoted can only be understood when it comes from the lips of a ~an w~o cal~s ~imself a defencist, who entirely takes up the posi­ t10n of impenahsm, of a man who justifies imperialist war and who rJ:!peats the bourgeois lie that in such a war the workers defend their fatherland.
If, indeed, one adopts the point of view that the work­ ers must not destroy and weaken the country during such a war it is tantamount to calling upon the workers to defend the fatherla~d in an .
imperia~ist war: And you know what the Bolshevik government, w~1ch considered its first duty to be to publish, to expose and to pillory the secret treaties, has done.
* You know that the Allies waged a war for.
the s~ke of t?e secret treaties and that the Kerensky government, which existed with the aid and support of the Menshe­ viks and the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, not only did not annul the s:cret treaties, but did not even publish them; you know that the Russian people waged the war for the sake of these secret treaties which promised the Russian landlords and capitalists, in the event of vic~ory, Constantinople, the Dardanelles, Lvov, Galicia and Arme11ia.
If Wf: ::!dopt the point of view of the tolerate these secret treaties? As loncr as we tolerated the secret treaties, as long as we tolerated the rul~ of the bourgeoisie in Russia,-we fostered the chauvinistic conviction in the minds of the German workers that there were no class conscious workers in Russia, that everyone in Russia supported imperialism and that Russia was pursuing a war for the purpose of plundering Austria and Turkey.
But the very opposite is the case.
The workers' and peasants' government has done more than any other government in the world to weaken the German imperialists, to tear the German wor.
kers away from them, because when the secret treaties were published and exposed to the world, even the German chauvinists, -even the German defencists, even those work­ ers who supported their government, had to admit in their news· paper V orwarts, their central organ, that "this is an act of a socialist government, a genuinely revolutionary act.
" They had to admit this because not a single imperialist government involved in the war did this; ours was the only government that denounced the secret treaties.
Of course, at the back of every German worker's mind, no mat· ter how cowed, downtrodden or bribed by the imperialists he may be, then~ is the thought: "Has not our government secret treaties?" [A voice: "Tell us about the Black Sea Heet.
"] All right, I will tell you about it, although it has nothing to do with the subject.
At the back of every German worker's mind there is the thought: "If the Russian workers have gone to the lengths of denouncing the secret treaties, has not the German government secret treaties?" VI/hen the Brest negotiations commenced Comrade Trotsky's ex­ posures reached the whole world.
Did not this policy rouse in an enemy country engaged in a terrible imperialist war with other governments, not anger, but the sympathy of the masses of the peo­ ple? The only government to do that was our government.
Our revolution succeeded in rousing a great revolutionary movement during war time in an enemy country merely by the fact that we denounced the secret treaties, by the fact that we said: "We will not be deterred by any danger.
" H we know, if we say, and not merely say, but mean it, that international revolution is the only salva­ tion from international war, from the imperialist massacre of the standing all difficulties and all dangers.
And when we took this.
­ path for the first time in history, in Germany, in the most imperial­ istic and most disciplined country, in the midst of war, a mass strike broke out and flared up in January.
* Of course, there are people who believe that the revolution can break out in a foreign country to order, by agreement.
These people are either mad or they are provocateurs.
We have experienced two revolutions during the past twelve years.
We know that revolutl.
ons cannot he made to order; or by agreement; they break out when tens of millions of people come to the conclusion that it is impossible to live in the old way any longer.
We know what difficulties accompanied the birth of the revolution in 1905 and in 1917, and we never expected revo­ lution to_ break oµt in other countries at one stroke, as a result of a single appeal.
The fact that revolution is beginning to grow in Germany and in Austria is a tribute to the great service rendered by the Russian October Revolution.
We read in the newspapers today that in Vienna, where the bread ration is smaller than ours, where the plunder of the Ukraine can bring no relief, where the popula­ tion says that it has never before experienced such horrors of starva­ tion, a Council of Workers' Deputies has sprung up.
In Vienna general strikes are breaking out again.
And we say to ourselves: This is the second step, this is the second proof that when the Russian workers denounced the im­ perialist secret treaties, when they expelled their bourgeoisie, they acted as consistent class conscious worker-internationalists, they facilitated the growth of the revolution in Germany and in Austria in.
a way that no other revolution in the world has ever done in a hostile country which was in a state of war and in which bitter feeling ran high.
To forecast when the revolution will break out, to promise that it will come tomorrow, would be deceiving you.
You remember, particularly those of you who experienced both Russian revolu­ tions, that no one in November 1904 could guarantee that within two months a hundred thousand St.
Petersburg workers would march to the Winter Palace and start the great revolution.
0 Recall December 1916.
How could w.
e guarantee that within lutions, know and realise that the progress of the revolution can· not be foretold and that revolution cannot be called forth.
We can only work for the revolution.
If you work consistently, if you work devotedly, if this work is linked up with the interests o~ the op· pressed masses who represent the .
majority, revol~tion ~111 come; but where how at what moment, frolll what unmediate cause, cannot be 'foretold.
That is why we shall never take the liberty of deceiving the masses by saying: "The German workers will help us tomorrow, they will blow up their Kaiser the day after to­ morrow.
" We have no right to say such things.
Our position is made difficult by the fact that the Russian revolu· tion proved to be ahead of other revolutions; but the fact that we are not alone is proved by the news that reaches us ne~rly every day th~t the best German Social-Democrats are expressmg themselves m favour of the Bolsheviks; that the Bolsheviks are being supported in the open German press by Clara Zetkin and also by Franz Meh-___ _ ring, who in a number of articles showed the German workers that the Bolsheviks alone properly understood what socialism is.
Re­ cently a Social-Democrat named Hoschka definitely stated in the Wiirttemberg Landtag that he regarded the Bolsheviks as models of consistency in the pursuit of a correct revolutionary policy.
Do you think that such statements do not find an echo among scores, hundreds and thousands of German workers who associate them· selves with them almost before they are uttered? When affairs in Germany have reached the stage of the formation of Councils of Workers' Deputies and of a second mass strike, we can say without the least exaggeration, without the least self-deception, that this marks the beginning of the revolution.
* We say very definitely: Our policy and our path was a correct policy and a correct path; we helped the Austrian and the German workers to regard them· selves, not as enemies strangling the Russian workers in the interests of the Kaiser, in the interests of the German capitalists, but as brothers of the Russian workers who are performing the same rev-olutionary work as they are.
.

· · I would also like to mention a passage in Paderin's speech which, incides with the idea expressed by the preceding speaker.
This is the passage: "We now see that civil war is going on within the work­ ing class.
Can we permit this to go oh?" You see therefore that civil war is described as war within the working class or as war against the peasants, as the preceding speaker described it.
We know perfecily well that Loth descriptions are wrong.
The civil war in Russia is the war waged by the workers and the poor peas­ ants against the landlo~ds and the capitalists.
This war is being prolonged and protracted because the Russian landlords and capi­ talists were vanquished in October and November with relatively small losses, were vanquished by the enthusiasm of the masses of the people amidst conditions in which it became immed!ately clear to them that the people would not support them.
Things reached the stage that even in the Don region where there is the largest number of rich Cossacks who live by exploiting wage labour, where the hopes of the counter-revolution were brightest, even there, Bogayevsky, the leader of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, then publicly admitted: "Ours is a lost cause because even in our region the majority of the population are on the side of the Bolsheviks.
" That was the position, that was how the landlords and capitalists lost their counter-revolutionary game in October and November.
That was the result of their adventure when they tried to or­ ganise the Junkers, the officers, the sons of landlords and capitalists into a White Guard to fight the workers' and peasants' revolution.
And now, as you know--read today's newspapers-the Czecho­ Slovak adventurers are operating with the financial assistance of th0 Anglo-French capitalists who are bribing troops for the pur­ pose of dragging us into the war again.
You have read what the Czecho-Slovaks said in Samara.
They said: "We shall join Dutov and Semyonov and compel the workers of Russia and the Russian people once again to fight against Germany side by side with Eng­ land and France.
We shall restore those secret treaties and fling you once again, for another four years perhaps, into this imperial­ ist war in alliance with the bourgeoisie.
" But instead of that we are now waging war against our bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie of all countries, and it is solely-due to the fact that we are waging the workers of one belligerent country see that in the other belligerent country close connections are being estab­ lished between the workers and the bourgeoisie it splits the workers up according to nation and unites them with their respective ~o~r­ geoisies.
This is a great evil, it means the collapse of the socialist revolution it means the collapse and doom of the whole Inter-.
, national.
In 1914 the International was wrecked because the workers of all countries united with the bourgeoisie in their respective coun­ tries and split their own ranks.
Now, this split is being h~aled.
Per­ haps you have read that ill England recently the Scottish school teacher and trade unionist MacLean was sentenced for a second time to five years' imprisonment-the first time he was sentenced to eighteen months-for exposing the rea~ .
obj.
ects ~f .
the war and speaking about the criminal nature of Bnt1sh impenahs~.
When he was released there was already a representative of the Soviet govern­ ment in England, Litvinov, who immediately apl?oint.
ed MacLea_n Consul, a representative of the Soviet Russian F'eaera°:ve Repub~1c in England, and the Scottish workers greeted this appornt~ent with enthusiasm.
The British government has for the second time com­ menced to persecute MacLean and this time not only as a Scottish school teacher but also as Consul of the Federative Soviet Repub­ lic.
MacLean is in prison because he came out openly as the repre­ sentative of our government; we have never seen this man, he is the beloved leader of the Scottish workers, he has never belonged to our Party, but we joined with him; the Russian and Scottish workers united against the British government in spite of the fact that the latter buys Czecho-Slovaks and is pursuing a furious poli?y to drag the Russian republic into the war.
This is proof that ~:!1 all countries, irrespective of their position in the war-in Germany which is fighting against us, in England which is trying to ~~ab Bagdad and completely strangle Turkey-the workers are umtmg with the Russian Bolsheviks, with the Russian Bolshevik revolution.
The speaker whose speech I have quoted said that workers and peasants are waging a civil war against workers an~ peasant~; we know perfectly well that this is not true.
The workmg class IS 27 I I I .
1 thing.
From 1871 to 1914, for almost half a century, the German working class served as a model of socialist.
organisation for the whole world.
We know that it had a' party with a membership oI a million, that it created trade unions with a membership of two, three and four millions; nevertheless, in the course of this half century hundreds of thousands of German workers were united in Catholic trade unions which stood staunchly for the priests, for the church and for the Kaiser.
Who were the real representatives of the working class? Was it the huge German Social-Democratic Party and the trade unions, or the hundreds of thousands of Catholic workers? The working class, which comprises the overwhelming majority of the class conscious, advanced thinking workers is one thing, while a single factory, a single district, a few groups of work­ ers who still remain on the side of the bourgeoisie, are another thing.
The overwhelming majority of the working class of Russia­ this is shown by the elections to the Soviets, the factory committees and conferences-ninety-nine per cent are on the side of the Sov­ iet government, knowing that this government is waging war against the bourgeoisie, against the kulaks and not against the peasants and workers.
This is altogether different.
If there is an insignificant group of workers still in slavish dependence upon the bourgeoisie we do not wage war against it but against the bourgeoisie.
If those insigni­ ficant groups which are still in alliance with the bourgeoisie get hurt in the process they have only themselves to blame.
A question was sent to me in writing: it reads as follows: "Why <C1re counter-revolutionary newspapers still published?" One of the reasons is that there are elements among the printefs who are bribed by the bourgeoisie [commotion, cries: "It is not true.
"] You can shout as much as you like, but you will not prevent me from telling the tr~th, which all the workers know and which I have just begun to explam.
When a worker attaches importance to the high wages he gets for working for the bourgeois press, when he says: "I want to preserve my high wages by helping the bourgeoisie to purvey poison, to poison the minds of the people," then I say it is as if these workers were bribed by the ho-urgeoisie, not in the sense that any have spoken about the English workers when the latter concluded an alliance with their capit'alists.
All of you who have read trade union literature know that there are not only trade unions in Eng­ land, but also alliances between the workers and capitalists in a par­ ticular industry for the purpose of raising prices and of robbing everybody else.
All Marxists, all Socialists of all countries point the finger of scorn at these cases and, beginning with Marx and Engels, say that there are workers who, owing to their ignorance and pursuit of their craft interests, allow themselves to be bribed by the bourgeoisie.
They sold their birthright, their right to the socialist revolution, by entering into an alliance w:lth their capitalists against the overwhelming majority of ~he workers and the op­ pressed toilers in their own country, against their own class.
The same thing is happening here; When certain groups of workers say: "The fact that the stuff we print is opium, poison, spreads lies and provocation, has nothing to do with us.
We get high wages and we don't care a hang for anybody else,"-we will denounce them.
In our literature we have always said and we say openly: "Such work­ ers are abandoning the working class and deserting to the side of the bourgeoisie.
" .
Comrades, I will in a moment deal with the questions that have been put to me; but first of all, so as not to forget, I will reply to the question about the Black Sea fleet that seems to have been put for the purpose of exposing us.
Let me tell you that the man who was operating there was Comrade Raskolnikov whom the Moscow and Petrograd workers know very well because of the agitation and.
Party work he has carried on.
Comrade Raskolnikov himself will tell you how he agitated in favour of destroying the fleet rather than al­ low the German troops to use it for the purpose of attacking Novo­ rossiisk.
That was the situation iii regard to the Black Sea fleet; and the People's Commissars Stalin, Shlyapnikov and Raskolnikov will arrive in Moscow soon and tell us all about it.
You will see therefore that ours was the only policy which, like the Brest Peace policy, caused us many misfortunes, but which enabled the Soviet government and the workers' socialist revolution to hold their ban­ ner aloft before the workers of all countries.
H today the number 27* Germany who are abandoning the old prejudices about the Bolsheviks, and who understand that our policy is correct, is growing, it is due to the tactics we have been pursuing since the Brest Treaty.
' Of the questions that were sent up to mE I will deal with the second one .
on the transportation of grain.
Certain workers ask: "Why do you prohibit individual workers from bringing grain into the town when it is for the use of their own families?" The reply is a simple one.
Just think what would happen if the thousands of poods that are necessary for a given locality, for a given factory, for a given district, or for a given street were carried by thousands of people.
If we allowed this the food supply organisations would begin to break down entii:ely.
We do not blame the man, tormented ~Y.
hunger, who travels into the country to get bread and procures it m whatever way he can, but we say: "We do not exist as a workers' and peasants' government for the purpose of legalising and en­ couraging disintegration and ruin.
" A government is not required for this purpose.
It is required for the purpose of uniting and or­ ganising the class conscious in order to combat lack of class con­ sciousness.
Vie cannot blame those >'lho owing to their lack of class consciousness throw up everything, close their eyes to everything, and try to save themselves by procuring grain in whatever way the~ can, but we can blame Party people who, while advocating the gram monopoly, do not sufficiently foster class consciousness and so!ida~ity in action.
Yes, the struggle against the bagman, against the private transportation of grain is a very difficult one because .
i_t is a struggle against ignorance, against lack of class consciousness against the lack of organisation of the broad masses; but we shall never aba~don this struggle.
Every time food-collecting campaigns are orgamsed we shall call for proletarian socialist methods of combating famine: having united.
together, let us replace the de­ teriorated food detachments by new forces, by fresher, stronger, more honest, more class conscious and tried men, and we shall collect the same amount of grain, the same thousands of poods that are collected individually by two hundred persons, each carrying fifteen· poods, each raisi.
ng prices and increasing profiteerino-.
We shall unite these two hundred persons, we shall create a strong0 com-we do not succeed in doing this at the first attempt we shall repeat our efforts; we shall try to induce the clas::; conscious workers in every factory to delegate larger numbers of more reliable people for the purpose of combating profiteeri°:g, ~nd we are sure that the class consciousness, discipline and orgamsation of the workers :will in the last resort withstand all severe t1'ials.
When people will have become convinced by their own experience that individual bagmen cannot help to save hundreds of thousands from starvation we will see the victory of the cause of organisation and class consciousness, and by united action we shall orgaI!.
ise the fight against famine and secure the proper distribution of grain.
I am asked: "Why is not the monopoly of manufactured goods, which are ?S necessary as grain, introduced?" My reply i~: "The Soviet government is adopting all measures_ to this end.
" You know that there is a tendency to organise, to amalgamate the textile fac­ tories, the textile industry.
You know that the majority 0£ the people in the leading bodies of this organisation are workers, you know that the Soviet government is preparing to nationalise all branches of industry; you know that the difficulties that confront us in this are enormous and that much effort will be required to do all this in an organised manner.
* We are not setting to work on this task in the way governments which rely on bureaucrats do.
It is quite easy to manage affairs in that way: let one man receive 400 rubles per month; let another get more, a thousand rubles per month­ our business is to o-ive orders and the others must obey.
That is how all bourgeois ~ountries are administered; they hire officials at high salaries, they hire the sons of the bourgeoisie and entrust the administration to them.
The Soviet Republic cannot be administered in this way.
We have no officials to manage and guide the work of amalgamating all the textile factories, of registering all their pro­ perty and stocks, of introducing a monopoly of all articles of pri­ mary necessity and of properly distributing them.
We call upon the workers to do this work; we call upon the representatives of the Textile Workers' Union and sav to them: "You -must be the ma­ jority on the leading body of tlie Central Textile Board, and yo1i are the majority on it, in the same way as you are the majority on the leading bodies of the Supreme Covncil of N ~t!onal Eco· nomy.
Comrades, workers, take up this very important state task yourselves.
We know that it is much more difficult than appointing efficient officials, but we know also that there is no other way of do­ ing it.
" Power must be placed in the'hands of the working class, and the advanced workers must, in spite of all difficulties, learn from their own bitter experience, from the work of their own hands, how all articles, all textile goods, should be distributed in the interests of the toilers.
Hence, the Soviet government is doing _all it possibly can in the present circumstances to introduce a state monopoly and to fix prices .
.
It is doing it through the medium of the workers, in conjunc­ tion with the workers; it gives them the majority on the management boards, and in every leading centre, as for example ora the Supreme Council of National Economy; the amalgamated meta~ works, or su­ gar factories which were nationalised in a few weeks.
This is a diffi­ cult road, but, I repeat, we cannot avoid difficulties in the task of transferring the workers, who have been accustomed and have been trained by the bourgeoisie for hundreds of years merely to slavish­ ly carry out its orders, to a new position, the task of making them feel that they are the government.
We are the owners of industry, we are the owners of the grain, we are the owners of all the wealth of the country.
Only when this has deeply penetrated the minds of the working class, when, by their own experience, by their own efforts, they increase their forces tenfold, will all the difficulties of the socialist revolution be overcome.
I conclude by once again appealing to this facto1y committee conference.
In the city of Moscow the difficulties are particularly great because it is an enormous centre of trade and profiteering in which, for many years, tens of thousands of people have obtained ' their livelihood by trade and profiteering.
Here the difficulties are particularly great, but here there are forces that no small town in the country possesses.
Let the workers' organisations, let the factory committees remember and firmly take into consideration what pres­ ent events and the famine that has affected the toilers of Russia teach.
New organisations, broader organisations of class conscious and advanced workers alone can save the revolution and prevent the restoration of the rule 6f the landlords and capitalists.
Class conscious workers are now in the majority, but it is not enough; they must take a greater part in general state work.
In Moscow .
we have hosts of cases of profiteers gambling on the famine, makmg profit out of the famine, breaking the state grain monopoly, of the rich having everything they desire.
In Moscow there ar.
e 8,000 members of the Communist Party.
In Moscow the trade umons can delegate 20 000 to 30 000 men and women whom they can vouch for, who will b'e reliable' and staunch exponents of proletarian policy.
Unite them create hundreds and thousands of detachments, fight the food pr~blem, search the whole of the rich population and you will secure what you need.
.
.
.
In my report I told you what successes were achie~ed m .
th:s sphere in the town of Eletz; but it is more difficult to achieve this m Moscow.
I said that Eletz was a well-organised town.
There are many towns that are much worse organised because this is a very difficult matter because it is not a matter of a shortage of arms­ we have any a:nount of them-the difficulty lies in appointing hun· dreds and thousands of reliable workers to responsible posts, work­ ers who understand that they are not working in their local cause but in the cause of the whole of Russia, who are capable of stick­ ing at their posts as representatives of the whole class, of organis­ ing the work according to a definite and systematic plan, of car~-y­ ing out orders, of carrying out the decisions of the Moscow Sov~et, of the Moscow organisations representing the whole of prole~an~n Moscow.
The whole difficulty lies in organising the proletariat, m training it to become more class conscious than it has been up to now.
Look at the Petrograd elections.
You will see that althou~h famine is raging there even worse than in Moscow and still greater misfortunes have befallen it, the loyalty to the w~rkers' ~ev· ·olution is growing, organisation and solidarity are mcreasmg, and you will say to yourselves: ·:simultaneously with the growth.
of ;the disasters that have befallen us the determination of the workmg class to overcome these difficulties is growing also.
Take this path, increase your efforts, put thousands of new detachments on this path to help to solve the food problem, and we, relying on your support, >l'ill overcome the f:;tmiµe (lrn;l secyre proper distribution.

Appearing on the morrow of the October Revolution in Russia and explaining as it does the path of development of the proletarian revolution and of the state of the proletarian dictatorship created by this revolution, this pamphlet has been and remains a fundamental work for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union which guides the dictatorship of the proletariat and socialist con­ struction in the U.
S.

It is also a fundamental work for the Communist Parties in all the capitalist countries, for the international revolutionary proletariat in its struggle for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
In the history of the struggle for the revolutionary theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism, this pamphlet is the direct continuation of the struggle against Right opportunist and "L~ft" anarchist distortions of Marxism which was begun by Marx and Engels and was unceasingly waged by Lenin and the Bolshevik Party from the very birth of Bolshevism.
Marx and Engels hammered out their doctrine in the struggle against liberalism and petty-bourgeois reformism (Lassalleanism, etc.
) and against anarchism (Proudhonism, Bakuninism, etc.
), against "bloodthirsty radicalism," as Engels called it, and also against other "Left" trends which were merely the reverse side of petty-bourgeois narrow-mindedness, which likewise carried bourgeois influences among the proletariat, but in other forms.
They were equally ruthless in their attacks upon the opportunist theories of the state, upon the lack of understanding and repudiation of the dictatorship of the proletariat by the successors of Lassalleanism, namely, the reformists in the ranks of the Socialist parties in the West which were fonned during their lifeiime.
After their death, with the development of reformism in the So­ cialist parties affiliated to the Second International, this distortion of revolu­ tionary Marxism and its renunciation assumed wide proportions as early as the end of the nineteenth century and affected growing circles of theo­ reticians and practical workers in the Second International (Bernsteinism, etc.
) .

t e ussian Party were guilty is ort10ns o arxism on the question of the state, and in their Pyatakov group.
In essence they arrived at the anarchist method of presenting the question of the state.
This was already revealed when they and the Polish and German "Left radicals" defended their anti-Marxian positions on the national and colonial questions.
(See Lenin, Selected Works, Volume V, "Im­ perialism and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination.
") They rejected the slogan of the right of nations to self-determination; they asserted that this slogan could not be adopted by the proletarian party under capitaHsm and was superfluous under socialism, thus completely leaving out of account the transition period from capitalism to socialism, the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the period of the existence of the proletarian state, which cannot be built up unless the right of nations to self-determination is rec­ ognised and applied.
This anarchist approach to the question of the state was very definitely expressed by Comrade Bukharin in 1916 in the magazine, The Youth International, in an article signed "Nota Bene" in which he identified the Marxian attitude towards the state with the anarchist attitude towards the state.
He asserted that, like the anarchists, the Marxists were on principle opposed to the state in general, that Marxists and anarchists equally set themselves the task of "blowing up" the state.
By asserting this he 1) denied the Marxian doctrine that it was necessary for the proletariat, after having broken up the state machine of the bourgeoisie, to create for the transition period from capitalism to socialism a new proletarian state, in other words he denied the need for the proletarian dictatorship and 2) he obscured the difference in principle between the anarchist "blowing up" of the bourgeois state and the Marxian destruction of this state, the "smashing," "breaking" of the state machine of the bourgeoisie: Lenin, in an article entitled "The Youth International" (see Selected Works, Volume V), attacked Bukharin's anarchist views on the question of the state and revolution and promised to deal further with the subject in a special article.
At the same time the editorial board of the magazine Sbomik Sotsial-Demokrata, of which Lenin was chief, rejected an article by Bukharin on the theory of the imperialist state, in which he enunciated his anarchist point·· of view.
After Lenin's death, Bukharin published this article in the magazine, Revolyutsiya Prava (Revolution in Law), No.
1, 1925, to which he appended a footnote stating: "The reader will readily see that I did not commit the mistake that was attri­ buted to me, because I distinctly saw the need for the dictatorship of the proletariat; on the other hand it will be seen from Ilyich's [Lenin's] note that he was wrong in his attitude towards the postulate of blowing up the state (the bourgeois state, of course) and confused this question with the question of the withering away of the dictatorship of the proletariat •.
•• After studying the question, Ilyich arrived at the same conclusion about blowing up the state.
" It is quite obvious from this footnote that in accusing Lenin of being "wrong" in his attitude towards the question of "blowing up" the state, mg up of confuse the anarchist "blowi ,, "f " h old posit10n.

oted at length from Lenin's notebooks on the struggle against Comrade Bukharin's anarchist views on the state.
In these notes Lenin wrote: "What distinguishes us from the anarchists is(") the use of the state now and (;3) during the proletarian revolution ('the dic­ tatorship of the proletariat')-points of extreme and immediate importance in practice.
(But it is these very points that Bukharin forgot!) "What distinguishes us from the opportunists is the more profound, 'more permanent' truths regarding ( wx) the temporary nature of the state , ([3[3) the harm of 'twaddle' about it now, ( rr) the not entirely state character of the dictatorship of the proletariat' ( oo) the contradiction between the state and freedom, (<<\the more correct idea (conception, programme-term) 'community' fo place of state, (/;/;) the 'smashing' (zerbrechen) of the bureaucratic-military machine.
It must not be forgotten also that the out­ spoken opportunists in Germany (Bernstein, Kolb, etc.
) directly repudiate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the official programme and Kautsky indirectly repudiate it, ignoring it in their day-to-day agitation and tolerating the renegacy of Kolb and Co.
"In August 1916, Bukharin was written to: 'allow your ideas regarding the state to mature.
' Without, however, allowing them to mature he broke into print as 'Nota Bene' and in such a way that, instead of unmasking the Kautskyists, he helped them by his errors! ! .
.
.
And yet, in essence, Bukharin is nearer to the truth than Kautsky.
" (Quoted by Stalin in his speech on the Right deviation, Leninism, Vol.
II.
) Writing to Comrade Kollontai on the same subject on March 2 [Feb­ ruary 17], 1917, Lenin wrote: "I am preparing (I have the material nearly ready) an article on the question of the attitude of Marxism towards the state.
I have arrived at conclusions that are sharper against Kautsky than against Bukharin (have you seen his 'Nota Bene' in The Youth International.
, No.
6, and Sbomik Sotsial.
-Demokrata, No.
2?).
The ques6on is one of supreme importance.
Bukharin is much better than Kautsky, but Bukharin's mistakes may kill this 'good cause' in the fight against Kautskyism.
" Thus, Bukharin's anarchist position and his anarchist criticism of op­ portunism on the question of the state only helped the Kautskyan vulgari­ sation and emasculation of Marxism and thus caused enormous harm in the struggle against Kautskyism.
As may be seen from the extract from the letter to Comrade Kollontai quoted above, Lenin had "the material nearly ready" for his work on the question "of the attitude of Marxism towards the state.
" This work was The State and Revolution.
The materials for this were the notebooks on "Marxism and the State" referred to above.
The February Revolution for a time prevented Lenin from completing the book.
He was only able to do so after the July days of 1917.
The Kerensky government had issued an order for Lenin's· arrest and so he went into hiding in a hut in the middle of a field in the village of Razliv, on the Finnish border.
There he asked for the materials to be sent to him and resumed his work.
Later he continued write six chapters and to begin on the seventh, which was to have dealt with the experience of the Revolution of 1905 and the February Revolution of 1917.
The work was interrupted by the unfolding of the October Revolution.

** The monopoly of powerful capitalist combines, trusts and syndi­ cates, headed and directed by finance capital (industrial capital merged with hank capital) through the hanks, is one of the most important and charac· teristic features of imperialism.
In his work, Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, Lenin says: "If it were necessary to give the briefest possible definition of imperialism, we should have to say that imperialism is the monopoly stage of capitalism.
" (Our italics.
-Ed.
) During the period of the World War this monopoly capitalism which characterises the epoch of imperialism was transformed into state-monopoly capitalism.
A distinction must he drawn between state capitalism under the proletarian state and state capitalism under the bourgeois state.
Under the proletarian state, state capitalism is private capitalism (e.
g.
, enterprises leased from the state by private persons, concessions, etc.
) regulated by the proletarian government in the interests of the proletariat.
(See "'Left-Wing' Childishness and Petty­ Bourgeois Mentality," chaps.
III and IV, in this volume.
) Under the bourgeois state it means that capitalist enterprises, or even whole branches of economy, are owned by the bourgeois state, or, in other words, by the bourgeoisie as a class, or else it is private capitalist industry, agriculture or commerce regulated by the bourgeois state in the interests of the bourgeoisie.
During the imperialist war the interests of the bourgeoisie in the belligerent coun­ tries demanded such regulation and standardisation of capitalist production and distribution for the purpose of subordinating them to the interests of "national defence" and the "fight to a finish" for the predatory aims pursued by the imperialist bourgeoisie in the belligerent countries.
It is this regula­ tion of production and distribution that Lenin here calls "the process of transformation of monopoly capitalism into state monopoly capitalism.
" Lenin repeatedly pointed to this "process of transformation" in a number of his previously written works.
For example, in an article entitled "The Turn in World Politics," written in· January 1917, he wrote: " .
.
• world capitalism, which .
.
.
in the beginning of the twentieth century grew into monopoly capitalism, i.
e.
, imperialism, made a considerable stride forward during the war, not only towards the greater concentration of finance capital, but also towards transformation into state capitalism.
'' (Collected W arks, Vol.
XIX.
) And the symptoms of this considerable stride, he thought, was the adoption of state regulation of national economy.
In the same article he wrote: "The extent to which modern society has ripened for the transition to socialism has been revealed by the war, during which the exertion of all the efforts of the nation called for the regulation of the economic life of more than fifty million people by one centre.

* The great German philosopher Hegel, who developed, the.
dial~c· f al method was an idealist.
It was Marx who converted Hegel s dialectics i~~o materiallst dialectics, "put it right side up" (Marx? ~n his .
preface to C ·t l y 1 I said it was "standing on its head") and, Jomtly with Engels, api a , o • , y l XI ) B · created dialectical materialism.
(See Selected W arks, o ·.
· eing an idealist in general, Hegel remained an idealist in his doctrme of the state.
According to his theory man is innately moral.
Man d~es not create mor:U· , ity; it exists independently of him in his g_eneral.
consc10us~ess as a sp~~1~~ moral law.
This law, in its turn, is the mamfestauon of the a~solute sp1nt, of "absolute reason," which lies at the base of the whole umverse and· d~­ mands the unconditional obedience of all.
The state is the produ~t of.
this moral law, its supreme consummation.
The moral idea, which exists.
inde­ pendently of man, is concretely realised in the state.
Hence, a~cordmg to Hegel, the state must not be regarded as the instrument of the mterests of individual persons, social organisations or classes.
.
.
Hegel's conception of the state was opposed to the bourgeois doctnne of the state propounded before him by Jean Jacques Rousseau, who reg.
arded the state as the product of the "social contract" which was t~e expressrnn ~f the totality of the wills of all the individual members of society.
Rou~sea.
u s theory of the state lacked the class conception of the state as ~he orgamsa:10n of the ruling class; nevertheless, for his time it was a revoluuonary doctrme, for it taught that the state was man's creatio~ and could be _changed by man.
According to Hegel's theory of the state this was not possible,.
~ecause, ac· cording to Hegel, the state is the product of th,~ absolute s?:n;; ab~olute reason, the expression, the manifestation of the absolute spint, which is beyond the sphere of man's influence.

* As will be.
seen from the passages Lenin quotes, by "self-acting armed organisation" Engels meant primitive tribal society in which all.
the members capable of bearing arms did so.
In so far as there v.
:as no.
pnvate property, no class division and no antagonism be~ween the pnvate _mterests of the individual members of the tribe and the mterests of the tnbe as a whole the arming of all the members of the tribe was possible.
In a society which' is divided into classes of oppressors and oppressed and which has a state as the organisation of the class rule of the oppressor~, the place of the "self-acting armed organisation" is taken by "special bodies of armed men," a standing army, a police force, etc.
, which serve as instruments for ~he armed protection of the rule of the oppressing classes and for the suppression of· the oppressed classes.

·' 28 turies in France (Louis XIV, XV and XVI) immediately preceded the French Revolution of 1789.
The commercial and industrial bourgeoisie, which devel­ oped within the framework of feudal' society, steadily became economicaily and politically stronger.
Although living by means of the feudal exploitation of the peasants, the feudal Iitndlords themselves often became financiiaily de­ pendent upon the growing bourgeoisie.
At a definite stage of development a certain equilibrium set in between the forces of the bourgeois class and the feudal landlord class.
The bourgeoisie was not yet strong enough to seize power, while the feudal landlords, having become economically weak, were not able to rule independently.
The state power, which in essence was a feudal landlord power, was compelled to heed the persistent demands of the bourgeoisie and to satisfy them within certain limits in order to protect the interests of its class, namely, the feudal landlords.
At the same time, the king, who was merely the largest feudal landlord in the country, relied on the feudal landlord class in bringing pressure to bear upon the bourgeoisie, particularly in regard to squeezing money out of them for the purpose of maintaining the state apparatus.
When, however, he desired to resist the efforts of the feudal landlords to restrict his power he relied upon the bour­ geoisie.
It was this position of the absolute monarchy that served as the external reason for the argument that the state stood above the conflicting classes and intervened in the struggle between therri only for the purpose of conciliating them.
As a matter of fact, the absolute monarchy was the state of the decaying feudal class.
As soon as the bourgeoisie became strong enough it overthrew the absolute monarchy and established its own clas·s state (the Great French Revolution of 1789-94), PAGE 20.
* Engels here refers to the Social-Democratic Party of Germany which at that time was the strongest unit in the international labour move­ ment.
PAGE 25.
* A striking example of the betrayal ·of the interests of the toiling classes by the alleged Socialists, who were in fact petty-bourgeois democrats, in 1848 and in 1871, is that of Louis Blanc.
In 1917, Lenin wrote: "The French Socialist, Louis Blanc, gained deplorable fame in the Revolution of 1848 by changing from the position of the class struggle to the position of petty­ bourgeois illusions, adorned with alleged 'Socialist' phraseology, but in reality serving to strengthen the influence of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat.
Louis Blanc expected aid from the bourgeoisie; he hoped, and aroused the hope in others, that the bourgeoisie could aid the workers in.
'organising labour'-this vague term having been supposed to express 'Socialist strivings.
' " (See Collected Works; Vol.
XX, "In Louis Blanc's Footsteps.
") Louis Blanc failed to understand the class character of the state and denied that the prole, tariat must wage a revolutionary struggle for power.
By "socialism" he meant the organisation of public workshops in all branches of indu~try working class, quite peacefully these workshops, he b.
eheved, wou le to re lace the capitalist "competitive sys­ and without a re;o~ut1onary st~gg ;kers' ;ssociations.

* Th~ Revolution of February 1848 in France placed power in the :•ands of the.
liberal republican section of the bourgeoisie.
The characteristic eatur_e o~ this revolution was that the working class for the first time came out with _its own class demands.
This revealed t4e enormous extent to which t~e :workm.
g class had grown, and served as a signal for the ·bourgeoisie of t e Immediate danger that threatened its.

That is why the immed··t task the f h r l<1 e 1 • governme~t o t e 1beral bourgeoisie set itself was to crush the revo ~trnnary working class.
This it succeeded in doing in the brutal su _ pre~sion of the June uprising of the working class in Paris against the bou~­ gems government.
But the growing anger of the workers after the June massacr~ warned the bourgeoisie that the im:::riediate danger to the bourgeois _system a~ not been removed.

" (The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte, chap.
Vil.
) The election of Louis Bona­ parte as president was but the first step towards the establishment of the monarchy: the interests of the big bourgeoisie, the desire to crush the working class, the desire to introduce class terror against the working class and the revolutionary section of the peasantry which was in a state of rebellion, called for the reinforcement of the "strong government.
" On December 2, 1851, Louis Bonaparte, with the aid of the army, and with the consent of the bourgeoisie itself, which had elected him as president, brought about a coup d'etat, dissolved the Legislative Assembly and proclaimed his period of presidency to be extended for ten years.
After the coup d'etat, amidst undisguised class terror against the working class, Bonaparte proclaimed him· self Emperor Napoleon III.
Thus the Second Empire came into being, which lasted until September 1870.
PAGE 2i.
* * The legitimist monarchy of Louis XVIII and Charles X in France lasted from 1815 to 1830.
After the fall of Napoleon I the feudal landlords who had been banished after the Revolution of 1789 were restored to power with the aid of the reactionary governments of Europe, and with them the --~---­ old Bourbon dynasty-was also restored.
This was the epoch of White terror and the annulment of the reforms brought about by the Great Revolution.
But during the period of restoration the legitimist monarchy could not abolish the fundamental social and economic changes brought about by the revolution; they could not restore the feudal relationships in the rural distric.
ts or the guild system in the towns.
The policy of this monarchy, however, was sub-ordinated to the interests of the feudal landlords who had been overthrown by the Great Revolution.
Incidentally, as compensation for the losses caused them by the revolution, they received a grant of one billion francs.
During these years the upper stratum, the aristocracy, as it were, of the bourgeoisie, was allowed to share power under c·ertain conditions.
The constitution, "granted" from above, and the protection of national industry secured the support of this upper stratum of the bourgeoisie for the monarchy.
But in-dustrial capitalism began to make rapid headway in France, and the bour-geoisie, and, ·of course, its upper stratum, became strong enough to take power entirely in its own hands; this put them in opposition to the Bourbon monarchy.
The implacable hatred of the peasantry towards the landlords, the growing poverty among the urban artisans and proletarians, the oppos:ition of the petty bourgeoisie which was being ruined by capitalism, and, finally, the conflict between the industrial bourgeoisie and the existing regime-all made another revolution inevitable in France.
This revolution broke out in July 1830 and w11s the ex:press:ion of the :protest of the broad masses a~ainst .
m 1793.
The government troops were defeated by the people Charles X fled and Tthe "legitimist monarch('· gave way to the bourgeois mo~archy.
.
.
~he July m~narchy, as it was called, existed from 1830 to 1848.
As a matter of fact, It was only a section of the bourgeoisie, the financial aristoc­ racy, t~at rul~d under this monarchy.
These were the "hankers, stock-brokers and railway kmgs and a section of the landowners who joined them: owners of ?oal _mi~;s, iron ~ines and forests" (Marx).
Louis Philippe, the "bour­ g.
eo1s king, came mto power by the will of capital.
During the revolu­ trnn of July 1830, victory was torn out of the hands of the masses of the people.
owing t? their weak state of organisation· and to the treachery of the repu?hcan ~ectrnn of the bourgeoisie.
Under the reign of the July monarchy ;he mdustnal revolut!on was completed in France; during the 'forties the .
actory 3:1d the machme became established in French industry.
A consider· able sectrnn of the peasantry was in the power of the usurers.
Soon a severe struggle .
broke o~~ between the industrial a11d financial bourgeoisie for pre­ ference m e;xplo1tmg the workers and the masses of the peasants.
The em­ p~oyer,s reqmred th~ extensive proletarianisation of the peasantry, its divorce­ ment ~rom the land; the usurers and bankers dreamed of tying the peasants to their small plots of land.
The petty bourgeoisie was driven from power and only the rich property.
owners enjoyed the franchise.
All this gave rise t·~ .
a number of antagonisms in the country which served to create the con· d1t10~s for ~other revolution.
During this period the proletariat acquired considerable importance.
Owing to the growth of factory indu5try the reign of the ~uly r:ionarchy saw the growth of the labour movemeni.
In 1847 the antagomsms m the country had matured sufficiently for another revolution a~d the latter became inevitable.
The fate of the July monarchy was deter· mmed by the Revolution of February 1848 (see preceding note).

violent revolution to the Continent of Europe, i.
e.
, conceives of Eng, land and America being the exceptions to the rule, Marx also indicated this possibility for England and Holland in a speech he delivered at the Hague in 1874.
In his pamphlet, The Peasant Question in France and GermMy, Engels mentions Marx's statement that "it would be advantageons for the proletariat to ransom themselves from the whole of this gang," i.
e.
, buy out the land, the factories and other means of production from the bourgeoisie.
Jn addition to the passage in The State and Revolution here commented on, an explanation of Marx's opinion in regard to this question will also be found in " 'Left-Wing' Childishness and Petty-Bourgeois Mentality," in this volume.
In both cases Lenin shows that the reasons which induced Marx to believe that a p~aceful transition of power and the means of production to the proletariat was possible in England are no longer valid.
At the Fif­ teenth Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Comrade Stalin dealt with this question twice.
He said: "The limitation or exception which Marx· conceived of in the case of England and America was valid as long as there was no developed imperialism and developed bureaucracy.
in those countries.
In Lenin's opinion this limitation no longer applies in the new conditions of monopoly capitalism, when militarism and bureaucracy have developed in England and America no less, if not more, than on ·the Continent of Europe.
Therefore, violent revqlution, the dictatorship of the proletariat, is an inevitable condition of the advance towards socialism in all imperialist countries without exceptio rl.
That is why the opportunists of all countries, in clutching at the conditional limitation which Marx conceived of, and in opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat, are defending not M arxi~m, but their own ·cause.
Lenin arrived at this conclusion because he was able to distinguish between the letter of Marxism and the sub· stance of Marxism; he regarded :Marxism, not as a dogma, but as a guide to action.
" PAGE 42.
* Eduard Bernstein was a prominent opportunist in the pre-war period, a social-chauvinist during the war ·and a soeial-fascist after it.
In 1897 he wrote a series· of articles for the theoretical organ of the German Social-Democratic Party, Neue Zeit, entitled "Problems of Socialism," which in a slightly revised form were afterwards published in book form under the title The Premises of Socialism a:nd the Tasks of Social-Democracy.
In these articles he "criticised" Marxism like an agent of the bourgeoisie hi the labour movement and repudiated the fundamentals of Marxism.
For the growth and intensification of the contradictions· of capitalism he substituted the subsiding of the struggle and collaboration between the proletariat and formation of capitalist society by means of the collaboration of classes on the basis of bourgeois democracy and the peaceful evolution of capitalism into socialism.
On these grounds he cl,emanded that the Social-Democratic Party be converted from a party of the proletariat into an inter-class party of social reform, i.
e.
, in effect, into a liberal-bourgeois party.
In these articles he "exercised his talents in repeating the vulgar bourgeois jeers" at the "pri~itive democracy" of Marx and Engels.
The editorial hoard of the Neue Zeit, of which Kautsky was the head, not only accepted Bernstein's articles, hut even published them without any comment.
Later on, Kautsky belatedly criticised Bernstein; hut on a number of questions, particularly on the funda­ mental questions of the revolutionary theory of Marxism, namely, the ques­ tions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the need for the proletariat breaking up the bourgeois state machine, his "criticism" was "not an argu­ ment against Bernstein, hut in essence a concession to him, a surrender· to opportunism.
" (See chap.
VI, sec.
2.
) Subsequently, the verbal criticism and condemnation of Bernstein and Bernsteinism by Kautsky and the leaders of the German Social-Democratic Party and of the Second International were accompanied by increasing concessions to Bernsteinism and by the adaptation of "orthodoxy".
to opportunism.
As Comrade Stalin has said: " .
.
.
the opportunists adapted themselves to the bourgeoisie; as for the 'or­ thodox' they adapted themselves to the opportunists .
.
.
.
As a result, oppor­ tunism dominated; because the links between the policy of the bourgeoisie and the policy of the 'orthodox' were joined.
" (Stalin, Leninism, Vol.
I, "Foundations of Leninism.
") From the nineties of the last century onward, Lenin consistently fought against Bernstein and his adherents Vollmar, David, Herz and Co.
and against opportunism generally in the Social-Democratic .
Party of Germany and in the Second International.
In 1900-03, und~r Lenin's leadership, Iskra and Zarya were the only consistent fighters against the Bernsteinians and their Russian followers, the Economists.
And the only party which from its formation in 1903 consistently pursued a course towards rupture with the opportunists in Russia and in the whole of the Second International (includ­ ing the Centrist Kautskyists) was the Bolshevik Party.

* Proudhon, the "founder of anarchism," as Lenin calls him later on, preached under the guise of socialism the return from capitalism to small production, thus expressing the reactionary utopian strivings of the petty l::ourgeoisie.
He was of the opinion that the working class could be eman­ cipated by ensuring for every worker the individual ownership of the means of production and the product of his labour.

* The Anti-Socialist Law was in operation in Germany for twelve years, from 1878 to 1890.
The law.
was passed for the purpose of sup­ pressing the labour: .
movement in.
Germany which was making tremendous headway.
The law deprived the working class and its party of political rights.
It empowered the police to close down.
the trade unions and all other work­ ers' associations and to suppress all publications which "in a form menacing the public peace, and particularly the harmony between the various classes of the population serve Social-Democratic, socialist or communist aims which have for their object the undermining of the foundations of the .
exist~ ing state ·and social system.
" It also empowered the police to prohibit meetings, the collection of funds for Social-Democratic purposes, etc.
Persons convicted of violating this law were liable to imprisonment.
It authorised the police to deport offenders; and the central authorities were empowered to declare a state of siege in vari-ous towns and localities if they considered it necessary.
At first the .
operation of the law was limited to two and a half· years, but on the demand of the government its operation was prolonged several times by the Reichstag and so it continued until 1890.
It is calculated that during the operation of the law 1,300 periodical and other publications and 332 workers' organisations were suppressed.
Over 900 persons were de­ ported and no less than 1,500 were tried and sentenced to imprisonment.
The actual number of persons who suffered penalties of various kinds was certainly much larger.
In spite of all this, the law failed to break the la­ bour movement in Germany and the Social-Democratic Party continued to grow and gain in strength.
It adapted itself tp the semi-legal conditions of exiEtence and transferred the publication of its central organ and held its congresses abroad.
When the law was finally repealed, the Social-Democratic Party trebled its vote at the elections (from 500,000 to 1,500,000); the mem­ herehip of the trade unions increased fourfold (from 50,000 to 200,000) and the number of journals published greatly increased.
But while the Party grew and gained in strength as a result of the twelve years' struggle under the Anti-Socialist Law; opportunism and conciliation with opportunism be­ came deep-rooted among the leading circles of the Party as a result of the fact that they had adapted themselves to legality within the restricted possi• hilities of the Anti-Socialist Law.
Marx and Engels, and after Marx's death Engels alone, waged an unceasing stmggle against this opportunism and conciliation and watched every step in the activities of the Party and its leaders.
The correspondence of Marx and Engels with the leaders of the Party in the period 1879-91 was largely devoted to this.
-~f England, separate laws were passed for that country, as is done for Scot-land to this day.

* The Constitution of 1791, cr(lated by the Great French Revo~u­ t" on put in the place of the old centralised bureaucratic apparatu~ extensi~e !~cal self-government based on the electoral principle, although with certam limitations of the franchise for those who owned no property.
~he country::~ divided into departments, arrondissements and commune~ (r.
e.
, urban .
.
rural municipalities).
Every town and rural commune h~~ its ~lected mumc1-"l ·1 and governing bodies for the larger admmistrative areas were pa COUnci , , ·.
d ' Jn also elected.
All these local governing bodies enioye extensive powers.
particular, the police were under their jurisdiction and when necessary they had the right to call for the aid of regular troops.
The central ?overnm~nt did not appoint any of its representatives to these local governmg ~odies.
Legislative powers were concentrated in a single Cham~er of Peop~e 5 Re­ presentatives.
There were repeated struggles on the quest~on of the nghts of the local government bodies in the period of the revolut10n, ,but the syste~ remained in force until the coup d'etat of the 18th Brumaire, 1799, when power passed into the hands of the Consuls, with Napoleon Bonaparte as (according to the new calendar adopted after the Revolution), drawn up by Napoleon, while preserving the outward form of a republic, con· centrated dictatorial power in the hands of the First Consul.
The elected local government bodies were abolished and iii their place prefects were appointed who were subordinate to the First Consul.
The arrondissement and muni­ cipal councils were reduced to the position of the prefects' offices.
All the local administrators, including the judges, were appointed by the First Con· sul, as were also the Ministers and the officers of the army and navy.
The First Consul alone had the right to initiate legislation.
The two Legislative Cham­ bers, the Tribunat and the Corps Legislatif, W!'Jre appointed by the Senatte Con~ervateur, which in its turn was appointed by the First Consul.
In 1802, when Napoleon was proclaimed -Consul for life, his dictatorial powers were still further increased.
Thus, after the coup d'etat of the 18th Brumaire, in place of the principle of decentralisation that prevailed during the repub· lie, the strict bureaucratic centralisation of the whole apparatus of ad­ ministration was introduced and the apparatus was subordinated to the First Consul who exercised dictatorial powers.
The bureaucratic cen­ tralised administration corresponded to the interests of the bourgeoisie which feared that the masses of the people would again rise in revolu­ tion and which dreamed of establishing a strong government that would ensure the stability of the bourgeois order.
The principle of electing public bodies appeared to be dangerous to the bourgeoisie because this would have strengthened the forces of the opponents of the bourgeoisie among the masses.
The principle of bureaucratic centralised administration was preserved in France throughout the nineteenth century and, combining itself with the "democratic" republic, it exists in a modified form to this day.

* Bund, i.
e.
, Federation.
Switzerland is a federation of twenty-two cantons.
According to the constituti_on each canton is a sovereign state; but in proportion as large-scale capitalism developed in Switzerland the inde· pendence of the canton, to which Engels refers, diminished.
The Constitution of 1848 gave the central government considerable powers over the cantons, but even this constitution did not satisfy the growing industrial and financial­ commercial bourgeoisie which strove to achieve the greater economic unity of the country.
In 1872 the bourgeoisie took a referendum on a proposed cen· tralised constitution, but it was rejected, mainly by the votes of the peas­ antry.
In 1874 another draft of a constitution was submitted to a referen­ dum which also contained the principle of centralised government, but which was worded in a more cautious form.
This draft was carried and is in force to this day.
After the adoption of the.
Constitution of 1874, the striving for cim­ tralisation, which reflected the development of industrial and finance capital, found expression in the adoption of numerous amendments to the constitu· tion, all tending to increase the powers of the Federal Government over the c1mtons, particularly in re~ard ~o ecc;momic questiom;.
or the Cadets, as they were called, with Milyukov at their head, demanded the erre<t of Lenin and the suppression of Pravda.
After the events of July 16 and 17, the counter-revolution gained the upper hand and began to break up the Bolshevik organisations.
On the night of July 17, the Junkers (students of the Military Academy) wrecked the offices of Prav~a, and on July l~ and 19 they wrecked the printing offices of the paper, which had b~en eqmpped with the aid of funds collected by the Petrograd workers, and killed a work· er named Voynov who had removed the copies of Listok Pr~vdy which had been printed.
On July 28, the Minister for War, Kerensky, issued an order for the closing of Pravda, and of Okopnara Pravd~ (Trench Trut~), the organ of the military organisation of the Riga Commiu:e of the Lettish So­ cial-Democratic Party.
This order was issued on the basis of a decree.
of the Provisional Government passed on July 26 authorising the Minister for War to "close periodical publications which incite to disobedience of.
~he orders of the military authorities, which incite to non-fulfilment of rmht~ dut! and which contain appeals for violence and chi! war, the responsible edi­ tors to be prosecuted in the prescribed order.
" After a brief interruption the publication of the central organ of the Bolshevik Party was resumed under di:fferent titles (The Worker and Soldier, The Proletarian, The Worker), the name being changed each time the Kerensky government suppressed the paper under the preceding title.
The reference which Lenin makes to his article in Pravda, No.
68, of June 10 [May 28], 1917, is to the article "One Question of Principle.
" (See Collected Works, Vol.
XX.
) In this article Lenin mentions the very passage from Engels quoted in the text and exposes the gross infringements of democ­ racy by the "Socialist" Ministers (the Mensheviks Tseretelli and Skobelev) during the conflict between the Kronstadt Soviet and the Provis~onal Gov­ ernment over the question of electing officials.
The Kronstadt SoVJet refused to accept the Commissar for Kronstadt appointed by the Provisional Gov­ ernment.
TsereteI!i and Skobelev, whom the Provisional Government had sent to Kronstadt to settle the question, forced upon the Kronstadt Soviet a "compromise" resolution which proposed that in the future the Com:nissar elected by the Soviet be endorsed by the Provisional Go;:ern~e~t.
,, T~1s.
was only one of the many infringements of democracy by the Socialist Mm1sters to the detriment of the interests of the workers, sailors and soldiers, only one of the steps towards counter-revolution which, together with their party, they definitely took after the July days.
It was part of the service they were rendering to the counter-revolution.
PAGE 69.
* The Bolsheviks had arranged for a peaceful demonstration to take place on June 23 [10], 1917, to protest against the policy of continuing.
the war pursued by the Provisional Government.
The First Congress of Soviets, which was then in session, and in which the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolu­ tionaries were in the majority, banned the demonstration.
Tseretelli, a pro· demanded that the workers be disarmed.
He said: "The Bolsheviks must be combated not ~ith words, not with resolutions; they must be deprived of all the techuicai u:eans in their possession.
" This "historical and hysterical" speech, as Lenin described it in another place, clearly demonstrated that the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries had deserted to the camp of the counter-revolution and it signalled the beginning of the open offensive against the working class.
Lenin compared the role of Tseretelli in demanding the disa1ming of the workers to that of the French General Cavaignap, Minister for War after the February Revolution of 1848 in France, who brutally suppressed the rebellion of the Paris workers in June of that year.
PAGE 70~* The cause of the "shameful collapse" of German Social-Democ­ racy in 1914, i.
e-, its utter betrayal of socialism and its desertion to the side of the bourgeoisie in the imperialist war, was the growth and final victory of opportunism.
This victory had been complete even before the war, but it manifested itself with the utmost clarity in the very first days of .
the war when at the meeting of the Reichstag on August 4, 1914, the Social-Demo­ cratic deputies voted for the war credits.
In the name of the Social-Democra­ tic fraction, Haase read a declaration which ended with the words: "We shall vote for the required credits.
" There were differences of opinion within the fraction on this question, however; 78 of the deputies were in favour of vot­ ing for the credits while 14 (Karl Liebkuecht and others) were opposed to doing so.
The Ininority, however, was prohibited from making its own de­ claration in the Reichstag, "and even Karl Liebkuecht, that tireless fighter ag'linst militarism, obeying Party discipline, submitted to this prohibition.
" On the second vote of war credits in the Reichstag on December 2 in the same year, Liebknecht, alone of all the Social-Democratic deputies, voted against the credits.

* From the very beginning of the World War, Plekhanov adopted a Right social-chauvinist position.
He declared that tsarism was waging a just war and au interview with him was published in the Italian press in which he justified "Russia's war of liberation against Germany's striving to convert her into her colony" and urged the desirability of the defeat of Germany.
At the same time he justified the social-chauvinist conduct of the leaders of the German Social-Democratic Party.
Declaring that it was '.
'un­ pleasant to shake the hand [of the German Social-Democrats] .
that reeks of the blood of the innocently killed," he nevertheless proposed that they be granted an "amnesty.
" He wrote: "It would be quite in place here to sub­ ordinate the heart to reason.
For the sake of the great cause of the Interna­ tional even a belated declaration must be taken into consideration.
" The prominent leaders of anarchism mentioned by Lenin acted in the same "Plekhanovist" way from ·the very outbreak of the war.
PAGE us:* Lenin's p~mphlet The Proletarian Revolution and the .
Rene­ gade Kautsky was written in October-November 1918 and published at the end of that year as a reply to a pamphlet.
by Kautsky entitled .
The Dictator­ ship of the Proletariat, in which he made a counter-revolutionary attack on the dictatorship· of the proletariat and on the proletarian revolution in Russia, which had established this dictatorship.
In the present pamphlet Lenin replies to Kautsky, denounces him as a renegade from· Marxism and, utterly exposing the counter-revolutionary nature of his attack, further develops in a more concrete manner the fundamental ideas he enunciated in his previous work on the proletarian revolution and the.
proletarian dictatorship, The State and Revolution (in this volume).
Analysing the stages which the revolution in Russia had passed through, Lenin in this pamphlet makes a theoretical analysis of the various problems that were brought to the front in the course of the class struggle in the first country to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.
In this· analysis, Lenin devotes special attention to the problem of bourgeois and proletarian democracy and links it up very closely with the problem of class relation­ ships in the proletarian revolution.
At a time when an immediate revo­ lutionary situation was maturing in Germany and when broad.
strata of the workino-class still harboured illusions about the revolutionary character ·of the So~ial-Democrats in general and of Kautsky in particular, .
the latter, by substituting the idea .
of "pure;' democracy, by whieh was meant bourgeois democracy, for the Marxian doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat, for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie and from the necessity of_ the proletariat establishin" its own class dictatorship by armed force.
Lenin reveal_s the " .
k' utter futility and the counter-revolutionary nature of Kauts y s attempt to refute the doctrine of the violent proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, which he, Lenin, had developed in his book, The State and Revolution, on the basis of the works of the founders of Marxism.
Lenin shows why it is wrong to speak about democracy "in general" and about "pure" democracy, why one must speak about bourgeois democracy and proletarian democracy.
He shows also that the Social-Democrats, in defending "pure" democracy, were really defending the bourgeois state, and that in doing so they strove to prove that the proletariat must not use violence against its class enemies.
He exposes the totally anti-Marxian character of Kautsky's arguments about democracy in general and dictator· ship in general, of his contrasting the one with the other, and proclaiming bourgeois democracy to be democracy for all.
Kautsky asserted that there could be no democracy under a dictatorship, and hence that there was no democracy under the proletarian dictatorship in Russia.
As a matter of fact the dictatorship of the proletariat, by abolishing bourgeois democracy and' the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie which lay concealed behind it, establishes proletarian democracy, democracy "for the poor," in place of democracy "for the rich.
" According to Kautsky, Marx never recognised that it was necessary for the proletariat to establish its own class dictator· ship.
He argued that the term "dictatorship of the proletariat" used by Marx in a number of his works was an accidental slip of the pen, which should be interpreted to mean "universal democracy" and formal equality.
Lenin, in this pamphlet, utilising the rich experience of the class struggle, shows that there can be no equality between the exploited and the exploiter.
Kautsky, in his admiration for the formal equality that exists under bour­ geois "universal" democracy, refused to see its reverse side-the dictator­ ship of the bourgeoisie.
He obscured the core of the question of the class struggle of the proletariat, namely, the question of the proletarian dictator­ ship.
He denied the most important thing-the necessity of waging the struggle until the dictatorship of the proletariat is established.
Kautsky transformed Marx into an advocate of the peaceful evolution of capitalism into socialism, utterly distorting his revolutionary theory.
He conceived the possibility of the proletariat achieving victory by winning a majority in par­ liament and totally rejected the only real path of transition of power to the working class, viz.
, violent revolution.
Lenin's striking exposure of this counter-revolutionary theory by means of evidence brought from the international experience of the proletarian class struggle, and primarily from the experience of the revolution in Russia, was of exceptional significance at a _ _!ime when in Western Europe class battles were assuming increasing dimensions and intensity.
Lenin revealed the form of democracy:_ the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie has bourgeois, formal dem· ocracy, whereas the dictatorship of the proletariat has proletarian democracy.
He showed that the rule of the proletariat is incompatible with the preserva­ tion of bourgeois democracy, which is only a form of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and an instrument for the suppression of the proletariat and of all the toilers in the interests of the bourgeoisie.
Lenin quotes striking examples to illustrate how in Russia, in the very first months after the October Revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat introduced genuine democracy for the overwhelming majority of the population-proletarian, Soviet democracy.
Simultaneously, he exposes the real, i.
e.
, the counter· revolutionary meaning of ·Kautsky's defence of the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, whom he, Kautsky, tried to palm off as real social­ ists.
He shows that ·the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary parties were enemies of the revolutioR, that they displayed activity only in fighting against it.
The Bolshevik Party was the only party that fought for the socialist revolution, for the dictatorship of the proletariat and, hence, for proletarian .
democracy, i.
e.
, democracy for the broad masses of the toilers.
The present pamphlet is really a direct continuation ot Lenin's work The State and Revolution.
It enriches the doctrine of the proletarian revolution and of the dictatorship of the proletariat with a number of.
new theoret­ ical propositions which logically followed from the experience of the proletar­ ian dictatorship in Russia already accumulated at the time it was written.
PAGE ll5.
** Struvism (from the name of P.
Struve, the so-called Russian legal Marxist; for further particulars see note to p.
456* in Selected Works, Vol.
I) and Brentano-ism (from the name of the German professor Brentano) were theories which took from Marxism its admission that capitalism was progressive compared with feudalism and semi-feudalism, but rejected the essence of Marxism-the class struggle of the proletariat for the establish­ ment of its dictatorship, the necessity and inevitability of the proletarian revolution and of the proletarian dictatorship.
Plekhanov was already slip­ ping into Struvism even before the imperialist war, and during the war he used it as grounds for justifying his social-chauvinist position.
He was fond of repeating the proposition-which was absolutely correct for pre-war Russia-that Russia was suffering not so much from· the development of capitalism as from the inadequate development of capitalism; but he drew utterly non-Marxist conclusions from it.
He argued that the sole task of the proletariat in the bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1905-07 in Russia was to remove the obstacles to the development of capitalism.
Thus he saw only the tasks that confronted the bourgeoisie and failed to see the indepen-· dent class aims of the proletariat in this revolution.
He denied· that the proletariat had any independent tasks, and opposed these tasks as for­ mulated by Lenin and the Bolsheviks in their slogan "the revolutionary-29 tion of which would ensure the possibility of passing from· the bourgeois­ deniocratic revolution to the socialist revolutiOn i=ediately after the over­ throw of tsarism.
Plekhanov was of the opinion that in the bourgeois-demo­ cratic revolution the proletariat should not take up any special class tasks that would run counter to the tasks of the bourgeoisie, that all the prole­ tariat should do was to support the bourgeoisie, push it forward, enter into an agreement or bloc with it, but not to frighten it away from the revolu­ tion and not to break up the united front with it by employing the tactics and the slogans advocated by the Bolsheviks.
On the outbreak of the imperialist war, Plekhanov adopted a pronounced social-chauvinist position, and one of the principal arguments he advanced in support of this position of defending tsarist Russia was his old argument that Russia did noi suffer so much from the development of capitalism as from its inadequate develop· ment.
The defeat of Russia by Germany, he argued, would lead to the economic enslavement of Russia, to the retarding -of the development of Russi® capitaUsm, whereas the proletariat was interested in the development of capitalism in its country, for it alone paved the way to socialism.
Hence, the proletariat should have gone to war in defence of tsarist Russia.
He rejected the argument th_at the war was an imperialist war, and he rejected the special tasks which confronted the proletariat of all the belligerent countries in the midst of the growing revolutionary crisis caused by the war, namely, the tasks formulated by Lenin in his slogan "transform the imperialist war into civil war.
" Just as in the conditions of the 1905-07 Revolution, so also in the conditions of the imperialist war, plekhanov rejected the special class tasks which· confronted .
the Russian .
proletariat at that time; namely, through the bourgeois-democratic revolution to pas~ immediately to the socialist revolution, and in this way turn the country from the capital­ ist path of development to the socialist path~ Plekhanov, like Struve and th.
e Struvists in the.
nineties of the last century, allowed the progressive character of capitalist· development to obliterate the class tasks of the proletariat.
And just as Struve with his iilleged Marxism found himself in the camp of the bourgeoisie, so Plekhanov, by distorting, vulgarlsing and emasculating Marxism, found himself in the camp of the bourgeoisie in the period of the war.

Lenin here refers to Kautsky's book The Road to Power, published in 1909, which deals with the question of the political revolution of the proletariat.
In it Kautsky argued that in the new epoch of war and revolution that was approaching the proletariat could "win and firmly maintain political power.
" He spoke of the struggle for power as a ''noble struggle" and of· the winning of power as a "magnificent victory.
" In· one of the chapters ·of this pamphlet, he even mentioned "the slogan of the dictatorship of the proleta:dat," which was advanced by Marx and.
Engels, the slogan of "the political sovereignty of the proletariat as the sole a genuine Marxist.
As Lenin says, even in this, one of the relatively good books written by Kautsky in the pre-war period, and one which dealt with the proletariat's "road to power," "the special features of the proletarian revq.
lution are obscured.
" Hence this pamphlet served only as another link in the chain of Kautsky's literary pronouncements, by means of which he prepared for himself the "loop-hole" for the complete surrender of his positions and for sinking to the level of "pure and despicable opportunism" and to the "renunciation of revolution in deeds while recognising it in words" which Lenin pointed to during Kautsky's.
controversy with Pannekoek in 1912 (see end of last chapter in The State and Revolution, in this volume).

*-* This refers to the -French petty-bourgeois Social"Democratic Party led by Ledru-Rollin, which acted a~ the Left opposition in the Consti­ tuent Assembly in France in 1848.
The majority in the Assembly consisted of Monarchists.
The Social-Democratic Party relied for support upon the urban petty bourgeoisie, a section of the peasantry and certain section;s of the proletariat which had not yet abandoned their petty-bourgeois illusions and foolishly believed that it was possible to realise "the right to work" under capitalism and to emancipate the workers from capitalist bondage by means of free credits, etc.
In the political sphere, the Social-Democratic Party de­ manded "the sovereignty of the people," i.
e.
, a democratic republic and universal suffrage.
It was in favour of state intervention in economic rela­ tionships and of the introduction of a progressive income tax.
This Social­ Democratic Party did not, however, demand the socialisation of the means of production.
A class analysis and an appreciation _of the activities of this party are given by Marx in his Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte and The Class Struggles in France in 1848-1851.

* The Jesuits were a militant order of Catholics, known as the 29* the sixteenth century by the soldier and priest, Ignatius Loyola, for the purpose of fighting for the protection of the Catholic religion and of the power of the Pope and the · Catholic Church.
The Jesuits carried out the Bloody Inquisition in the Catholic Church, and the history of their order is a history of murder, plunder, tor· ture and the stake.
After the discovery of America, the Spaniards and Portuguese subjugated the native population with fire and sword.
The perse· cution of the Indians in South America was particularly cruel.
The popu· lation fled to the forests, and when the Jesuit missionaries visited the country at the end of the sixteenth century they found the formerly flourishing land in a state of utter ruin.
The Jesuits decided to· "tame the natives" by other means.
They allowed the population a certain amount of liberty, hut they compelled them all, without exception, to till the land and to work in the service of their "benefactors.
" For two days in the week the Indians were allowed to work for themselves, and for the rest of the week they presented their labour as a "gift to God," i.
e.
, to the Jesuits.
Reactionary European publicists described this system as "the communism of the Jesuits in Paraguay.
" What this "communism" amounted to was that the Jesuits and their Order became rich and the Indians were transformed into their serfs.
The Jesuit colonies existed· in South America up to the middle of the eighteenth century.

n all "democracies of the world," Lenin means the revolutionary oppositions in the Socialist parties affiliated to the Second International, which were formed in a number of countries at the time of the imperialist war.
Such a group, for example, was the International group, later known as the Spartacus League, which was led by Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in Germany.
These groups did not "despicably betray socialism," and did not go over to the side of "their" bourgeoisie, but fought against it, fought against the war, and against open and concealed (Centrist) opportunism.
They were not, however, sufficiently consistent in their internationalism and in their struggle against social-chauv· inism; they hesitated to break off all connections with the Second Inter­ national, and on a number of questions (for example, on the national-colonial question) they took up an anti-Marxian and semi-Menshevik position.
The Bolshevik Party, led by Lenin, was the only party that was thoroughly con­ sistent in its revolutionary and internationalist position, and, while supporting these groups in their fight against the Second International" and uniting them under its leadership in what was known as the Zimmerwald Left, it combated their inconsistencies and their "Left" opportunist, semi-Menshevik .

This campaign was supported by the Socialist-Revolutionaries.

* The elections to the State Dumas, under the tear, were con· ducted on a class basis, the electors being divided into separate categories, or curiae, each curia being given a certain number of deputies, so apportioned as to give the landlords and capitalists an overwhelming majority.
The workers were put in a separate curia.
During the elections to the Second Duma, the workers' curia elected twenty-three deputies-twelve Mensheviks and eleven Bolsheviks.
Later, the law passed by Stolypin on June 16, 1907, allowed only :six deputies for the workers' curia.
By a special clause in this act, the working class electors in the Moscow, St.
Petersburg, Kostroma, Vladimir, Kharkov and Ekaterinoslav gubernias were grouped in a separate curia.
In each of these gubernias, the workers elected their delegates to the gubernia electoral college, which consisted of the delegates of all the curiae, and this college was obliged by the law to elect one workers' deputy.
In the other gubernias of the country this law did not apply, and it was almost impossible for the workers to secure the election of any of their deputies.
During the elections to the Third and Fourth Dumas, the Bolsheviks managed to secure the election of their candidates in all six of the gubernia electoral colleges.
The Bolsheviks utilised the Dumas as a platform from which they exposed and attacked the reactionary policy of the tsarist government and the bourgeois parties, and called the attention of the masses of the toilers to the tasks of the struggle of the proletariat.

** As soon as it came into power, the Soviet government published the secret treaties r:included between the tsarist and Provisional governments and the Allies, and thus exposed the true objects for which the war was being waged.
During the peace negotiations with Germany, the Soviet gov· ernment published in full the text of the speeches delivered on both sides and also the documents connected with the negotiations, and emphasised its hostility to the secret diplomacy of the bourgeoisie.

* The first Soviet of Workers' Deputies was formed in lvanovo· Voznesensk during a strike in the summer of 1905.
During the general strike in October 1905, Soviets of Workers' Deputies were formed in a number of other important industrial centres.
Frequently, the strike committees were transformed into Soviets.
The leading role among the Soviets in 1905 was played by the St.
Petersburg Soviet, the influence of which was nation-wide.
The Moscow Soviet also played a very important part by leading the Decem­ ber movement in Moscow in that year.
It declared a general strike and trans­ formed it into an armed uprising.
The Bolsheviks fought the Mensheviks on the question of the role :m.

* The slogan "All power to the Constituent Assembly" was ad­ vanced by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in March 1917 but as a matter of fact, they and the bourgeoisie did all they could to p~t off the convocation of the Constituent Assembly.
After the October Revolution, which transferred power to the Soviets, this slogan became nothing more nor less than the slogan of the bourgeois counter-revolution, because the transfer of power to the Constituent Assembly would then have meant the overthrow of the power of the Soviets and the liquidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
During the Civil War of 1918-20, this slogan served to rally all the counter-revolutionary elements.
PAGE 158.
* By "revolutionary democracy" the Mensheviks and the Socialist­ Revolutionaries meant.
their own parties and the Soviets, in which, in the period from March to August 1917, they were in the majority.
The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries tried to reconcile the existence of the Soviets with the existence of a "democratic," i.
e.
, parliamentary, and therefore bourgeois state power.
In their opinion the Soviets were to serve as "talking shops" and to have no power whatever.
With their chatter about "revolutionary democracy" at a time when it was necessary to mobilise the working class and all the toilers for the struggle against the rule of the capitalists and for the rule of the Soviets, the Mensheviks served the bour­ geoisie, disorganised the working class and the peasantry, fought with all their might against the Soviets taking power, and disintegrated them.
In July 1917, the Soviets, under their leadership, had ceased to represent the real relationship of class forces in the country and to serve as the real re­ presentative of the masses of the workers and soldiers, who were now follow­ ing the lead of the Bolsheviks.
As Lenin said, they had become "a fig-leaf of the counter-revolution.
" In an article entitled "Firm Revolutionary Power" (Collected Works, Vol.
XX), Lenin says: "When one speaks · o~ 'rev?lution,' of the 'revolutionary people,' of 'revolutionary democracy,' etc.
, nme tlnies out of ten it is a lie or self-deception.
" The lie consisted in the fact that .
in scattering phrases like "democracy," "revolution" and "revolu­ tionary democracy," the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries glossed over the class character of the Soviets and of the bourgeois state and obscured the fact that it is impossible for the Soviets, as organs of the proletariat and of the toiling masses led by the former, to live peacefully side by side whh the bourgeois state when the proletariat and the toiling masses are conscious of their interests.
Lenin replied to these phrases about "revolutionary democracy" in the following "'words: "Gentlemen heroes of the phrase! Gentlemen knights of revolution~ry grandiloquence! Socialism implies a distinction between capitalist cf!!mocracy and proletarian democracy, between Phrases.

* The Democratic Conference was convened by the Kerensky government after the Kornilov mutiny for the purpose of restoring the prestige of the Provisional Government.
The Conference took place in Petrograd and lasted from September 27 to October 5.
It consisted of repre­ sentatives of the Zemstvos, co-operative societies and certain other public or­ ganisations, of the trade unions and of the Soviets.
The representatives of the Soviets were in an insignificant minority at the Conference.
The Democratic Conference elected a Provisional Council of the Republic, which became known as the "Pre-parliament.
" The purpose of this Council, after re­ presentatives of the bourgeoisie-the so-called property qualification elements -had been added to it, was to serve as a representative organ until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly.
This Council, however, enio1ed no .
prestige whatever.
The government ignored its decisions as well as the decisions of the Democratic Conference.
It merely wished to utilise the Conference and the Pre-parliament as a pretext for putting off the convocation of the Constituent Assembly.
In a letter addressed to the.
Central Committee, the Petrograd Committee and the Moscow Committee .
of the Party, Lenin wrote: "The Democratic Conference repJ1esents not a majority of the revolu­ tionary people, but only the compromising upper stratum of the petty bour­ geoisie .
.
.
.
the Democratic Conference is decei"ing the pea.

* After the insurrection in Paris on March 18, 1871, the bourgeois government of Thiers fled to Versailles and there began to organise its forces for the purpose of crushing the Paris Commune, At first they tried to persuade Bismarck to occupy Paris, which was then besieged by the Prussian troops.
But Bismarck refused, and thereby compelled the Versaillese, who at that time had no forces of their own with which to fight the Paris Commune, to agree readily to the harsh peace terms which he imposed upon France.
The Versaillese had to agree to a somewhat different bargain than the one they desired in order to secure Bismarck's assistance in suppressing the Paris Commune.
Marx describes the bargain concluded between the French bourgeoisie and Bismarck in the following terms: "These termp included a shortening of the intervals in which the war indemnity w11s to be paid and the continued occupation of the Paris forts by Prussian troops until Bismarck should feel satisfied with the state of ,things• in France; Prussi.

He pledged his good faith by making payment of the first instalment of the indemnity dependent on the 'pacification' of Paris.
" (Marx, The Civil War in-F ranee, part IV.
) Thanh to this bargain with Bismarck the Versaillese government, headed by Thiers, obtained the armed forces ~vith which to invade Paris and crush the revolution.

** In 1918-19, the Ataman of the Orenburg Cossacks, Dutov, waged a counter-revolutionary war in the South Urals and the Trans-Volga reginns.
Dutov actively supported the Kolchak counter-revolution and co-ordinated his military operations with the Kolchak generals.
After the Kolchak forces were compelled to retreat to Siberia, Dutov managed to hold on to his positions in Orenburg and cut off Turkestan from the rest of the Soviet Republic.
After the Red Army captured Orenburg, the Dutov forces were routed.
In 1918 General Krasnov waged a counter-revolutionary war against the Soviet government in the region of the River Don, where he was defeated in 1919.
~fter this defeat, the general leadership of the counter-revolu1ionary · struggle m the South passed to General Denikin.

* The_ Czecho-Siovak counter-revolutionary war agaimt the Soviet Re­ publ'.
c was organi~ed by the governments of England and France in 1918.
Prev10us to that, m the summer of 1917, the Provisional Government had formed ~n army consisting of Czecho-Siovak prisoners of war for the purpose of figh~mg the Germans on the Russian Western front.
In, 1918, after the Brest-Litovsk Peace had been concluded between the German and Soviet gov~rnments, the Commander of the Czecho-Siovak forces declared that they d~sired to be transferred to France.
To this the Council of People's Com­ missars agreed.

* During the Great French Revolution of i789-94, power first passed into the hands of the big liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie, then into the hands of the more revolutionary strata of the middle bourgeoisie, and later into the hands of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie, represented by the J acobins.
At the time the latter were in power, the revolutionary government was -obliged to organise its forces to repel the intervention of the feudal-monarchist st.
ates of Europe and to wage a revolutionary war against them.
1:1\l old French army, which had been organised for the purpose of protectmg the feudal monarchy and the landlords, and which was officered by members of the nobility, was, of course, useless for the purpose of waging a revolutionary war.
The Jacobins had to organise a new army with officers drawn from the democratic strata of society; political commissars were appointed to the various units to represent the central government; extensive political ______________­ educational work was carried on in the army, particularly in regard to supply-ing newspapers, etc.
Strong in the fact that it was really the army of the rev-olution, this army proved invincible in the struggles against the feudal-monarchist states of Europe.

* The Christian-Anarchists were a trend which criticised the state, the official church, private property and the whole of the capitalist order, but denied the necessity of waging a political or any other kind of struggle against the system, and particularly denied the necessity of resorting to violence.
Their motto was "resist not evil by violence.
" They were of the opinion that it was possible to change the state of things by Christian conduct and by self-perfection.
The celebrated Russian writer, Leo Tolstoy, was the principal theoretician of Christian-Anarchism, particularly in Russia.
Tolstoy­ ism found adherents mainly amorig the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia.
It was a reflection of the immaturity of the revolutionary protest of the peasantry.
It was only by overcoming sentiments of this kind that the peasantry could come out as· a revolutionary force in the Russian revolution.
Lenin gives a class characterisation of the teachings of Tolstoy in his articles: "L.
Tolstoy as the Mirror of the Russian Revolution" and "L.
Tolstoy and His Epoch.

* This refers to the occupation by the German troops of Finland, the Ukraine, Latvia and Esthonia in the beginning of 1918.
In Jiinuacy and f ~brm1ry l9J81 fiµI!!ml was in the ~ip of +evolution.
The in.
sµr~!lnt work· troops came to the assistance of the Finnish bourgeois government and helped to crush the revolution.
In the Ukraine, the petty-bourgeois nationalist supporters of Petlura, with the aid of G.
erman troops, overthrew the Soviet government, which had not yet managed to consolidate itself; and later the German militarists overthrew the government of the nationalists, the so­ called Rada, and· established in its place the Black Hundred government of the Hetnian Skoropadsk.
y.
In Latvia and Esthonia the German troops of occupation, after overthrowing the Soviets, drove the labour movement under­ ground and organised the counter-revolutionary forces of these countries.
Lenin, in speaking of the betrayal of the Russian and international revolution by the German proletariat, means the objectively reactionary role which the German workers and peasants in soldiers' uniform had to play in the districts occupied by the Germans owing to the fact that the Social-Democrats concealed the true nature of the imperial government from the workers and did all they could to retard the development of the revolutionary labour move­ ment in Germany.
PAGE 185.
* Lenin here refers to an article by Karl Kautsky entitled "The Driv­ ing Forces and the Prospects of the Revolution," written in 1906.
At that time Kautsky took up a Centrist position in the struggle between Bolshevism and Menshevism, but in this article he temporarily inclined towards Bolshevism in the 'interpretation of the Russian Revolution of 1905-07 and its driving forces.
He characterised this revolution, as "not a bourgeois" and "not a socialist" revolution, but a revolution in which the bourgeoisie was not the driving force and could not take power; nor could the proletariat done achieve victory without the assistance of the peasantry, which is the ally of.
the proletariat in this revolution.
Lenin regarded this temporary inclination of Kautsky towards the Bolshevik view of the Russian revolution as a victory for Bolshevism, and he utilised it in the articles he wrote in his controversies with the Mensheviks.
PAGE 186.
* Lenin here refers to the explanation of the tasks of the prole­ tariat in the revolution, which he so strikingly summed up in his pamphlet The Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution in the following words: "The proletariat must carry out to the end the democratic revolution, and in this unite to itself the masses of the peasantry, in order to crush by force the resistMce of the autocracy and to paralyse the instability of the bour­ geoisie.
The proletariat must accomplish the socialist r.
evolution and in this unite to itself the mass of the semi-proletarian elements of the population, in order to crush by force the resistance of the bourgeoisie and to paralyse the instability of the peasantry__ and petty bourgeoisie.

** Evidently, Lenin here·refers to an article written by Marx: at the end of 1848 entitled "The Bourgeoisie and Counter-Revolution" ("The Balance Sheet of the Prussian Revolution"), in which he compares the role of the bourgeoisie in the German revolution of 1848 with that of the English bourgeoisie in the Cromwellian revolution of 1648 and of the French bour­ geoisie in the Great French Revolution of 1789.
In this article Marx says: "The March Revolution in Prussia" (i.
e.
, ~he Revolution of 1848.
-Ed.
) "must not be confused with the English Revolution of 1648, or with the French Revolution of 1789.
In these two last mentioned revolutions," he continues, "the bourgeoisie was the class which really stood at the head of the movement.
The proletariat and those sections of the urban population which did not belong to the bourgeoisie either had no interests apart from those of the bourgeoisie, or else did not yet represent an independently developed class, or section of a class.
Hence, where they opposed the bour­ geoisie, as for example in France in 1793 and 1794, they only fought for the realisation of the interests of the bourgeoisie, althougn they did not fight in the bourgeois manner .
.
.
.
" "Unlike the French bourgeoisie in 1789, the Prussian bourgeoisie was not the class which represented the · whole of modem society as against the representatives of the old society, the monarchy and the nobility.
It sank to the level of a sort of estate opposed to both the crown and the people, was in opposition to both of its opponents and irresolute towards each of them separately, because it saw both of them either before or behind it; from the very beginning, it was inclined to betray the people and to compromise with the crowned representatives of the old society, because it had already become part of the old society.

helm of the Prussian state after the March Revolution.
" If this is what the bourgeoisie of Prussia, the principal state in Gei:many at that time, was like in the Revolution of 1848, the bourgeoisie of the rest of Germany was no better.
This decrepit old man, cursed by all, ended by entering into a counter­ revolutionary bargain against the workers and peasants and helped to crush the revolution.
In his preface to the second edition of his Peasant War in Germany, Engels explains this bargain between the German bourgeoisie and the counter-revolution by the fact that at a certain point the bour­ geoisie ".
.
• begins to notice that this, its proletarian double, is outgrow­ ing it.
From that moment on, it loses the power for exclusive political domination; it looks round for allies with whom it shares its domination, .
.
• The German bourgeoisie was frightened not so much by the German as hy the French proletariat.
" In June 18~8, the proletariat of ·Paris made an attempt to seize power by armed forc.
e.
This attempt was crushed, but it showed the German bourgeoisie "what it had to expect.
'' And Engels goes on to say: "The German proletariat was just restless enough to make it clear that the seed of the same harvest had been sown in German soil also.
" In Russia in 1905, the proletariat wa,s much stronger and better organised than the German proletariat in 1848, and, moreover, it was led by the Bolshevik Party of the proletariat.
In the first Russian Revolution of 1905-07 the Russian bourgeoisie proved to be more decrepit, more inclined to conclude a bargain with the tsar, more counter-revolutionary than the German bourgeoisie in 1848.
It betrayed the Revolution of 1905-07, it entered into direct alliance with the tsar and the landlords, and when the workers and peasants (clothed in soldiers' uniforms) overthrew the auto· cracy in February 1917, it tried to restore the monarchy and put the Grand Duke Michael in the place of Nicholas.
Thus, in the bourgeois revolu­ tions in Germany in 1848 and in Russia in 1905-07 and February 1917, "to go no further than the bourgeoisie" meant going no further than concluding a bargain with the "crown," with tsansm, with the counter­ revolution.

* During the imperialist war, a Left wing led by Spiridonova, Kam­ kov and Natanson-Bobrov began to be formed in the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.
After the February Revolution, this Left wing opposed the coalition with the bourgeoisie and the imperialist foreign policy of the Provisional Government.
While remaining in their party, these Left Socialist-Revolu­ tionaries, as they were called, formed a separate faction, which pursued an independent line on a number of questions.
They did not have the cour­ age, however, to break off all connections with the Right Socialist-Revolu­ tionaries.
During the elections to the Constituent Assembly the Left Social­ ist-Revolutionary candidates ran on the same ticket as the Right Socialist· Revolutionaries.
At the Second Congress of Soviets, at the moment when power was seized by the Soviets, the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries left the Congress in protest; but the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries remained and elected their delegates to the Central Executive Committee.
They still feared, however, to break off all relations with the Right Socialist-Reva-.
lutionaries, and refused to appoint their representatives to the Council of People's Commissars.
Moreover, they demanded that the Bolsheviks form a "homogeneous Socialist government consisting of representatives of all Socialist parties.
" It was only in December 1917, after much wavering and hesitation,.
that the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries finally broke off all con· nections with the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and formed a separate party ~!101)'!1 a,s t):i~ l,~ff Soci~list-Jt~volution;iry farty (lnteniationalists); A~ their representatives to the Council of People's Commissars.
The Bolsheviks were in favour of forming a bloc with the Left Socialist-Revolut!onaries, because at that time they more or less consistently expressed the revolution· ary tendencies of the peasantry, its striving to consummate the bourgeois· democratic revolution, and were supported by the rural poor and the :waver­ ing middle peasants.
But, while expressing the revolutionary strivings of the peasantry, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in their _policy expressed the vacillations between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat that are character· istic of the petty bourgeoisie; and even when_ they were represent~d in the Soviet government they were in continuous conflict with the Bolsheviks.
Very sharp disagreements arose between the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviks at the time of the Brest-Litovsk Peace, in January and February 1918.
The former were opposed to the conclusion of peace and withdrew their representatives from the Council of People's Commissars.
In the summer of.
1918, to the disagreements on foreign policy were added disagreements on questions of economic construction (the Left So~ialist­ Revolutionaries were opposed to Lenin's economic plan advanced m the spring of 1918), on the question of the grain monopoly, on the grain pri~es policy, on the formation of Committees of Poor Peasants and on the sendmg oi workers' food detachments to the rural districts to obtain food for the towns.
' As the class struggle in the rural districts developed, the Left Social­ ist-Revolutionaries became the spokesmen of the kulaks, of the kulak counter-revolution that was developing in the rural districts against the so­ cialist revolution, against the dictatorship .
of the proletariat, and, fi~ally, they became the leaders of the kulak counter-revolution.
On July 6, 1918, they rose in armed rebellion in Moscow against the Soviet government.
Taking advantage of the fact that the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Alexan­ drovich was vice-presiden,t of the Cheka, two other Left Socialist-Revolution­ aries, Y.
Blumkin and N.
Andreyev, secured forged documents with which they gained admission to the German Embassy in Moscow, threw a bomb there and killed the Ge1kan Ambassador, Mirbach.
This was the signai for the Left Socialist-Revolutionary rebellion.
Having seized the central telegraph office, the Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Rev~lutio~ary Party on the night of July 6 sent telegrams all over the country, statmg: De­ tain all telegrams signed by Lenin, Trotsky and Sverdlov and all telegrams sent by counter-revolutionaries, Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, : Mensheviks, anarchists and all those who provoke the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries.
" In this wire the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries also proclaimed themselves the ruling party.
The Left Socialist-Revolutionary rebellion was doomed to failure from the very outset, for it found no support in the Red Army or among the workers of Moscow or any other part of the country.
The rebellion was crushed the very next day by the efforts of the masses of the Red Army and the workers.
After this a section of the Left Socialist-Re~olution­ aries went underground and continued to wage armed warfare agamst the and expressed themselves in favour of co·operating with the Bolsheviks.
This section broke up into two independent parties, the Narodnik-Communist Party and the Revolu'tionary Communist Party.
These parties did not exist long, however, and a considerable number of their members subsequently joined the Communist Party.

* Lenin here refers to the following passage in Marx's letter to K~gelmann of April 12, 1871: "If you look at the last chapter of my EYghteenth Brumaire you will find that I say ,that the next attempt of the French revolution will be no longer, as before, to transfer the bureaucratic military machine from one hand to another, but to smash it, and that is ~ssential for every real people's revolution on the Continent.
" (Letters to Dr.
Kugelmoon, p.
123.
) The last chapter of The Eighteenth Brumaire, to which Marx refers in this letter, shows what people's revolution he had in mind.
In this chapter Marx speaks of the smashing of .
the military.
bureaucratic state machine in connection with the possibility of a proletarian revolution in France supported by a-peasant "chorus," as the outcome of the inevitable overthrow of the.
monarchy of Napoleon III.

* During the rebellion of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow in July 1918, the Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolu~ tionary Party sent a telegram to the Left Socialist-Revolutionary, Muravyev, Co=ander-in-Chief of the Red Army fighting against the Czecho,Slovaks, informing him of the rebellion in Moscow and announcing that they had declared war on Germany.
Muravyev immediately issued an order to the troops to withdraw from this front and to march on Moscow, thus consider­ ably weakening the front against the Czecho-Slovaks.
Thanks to the Bol­ shevik Party leadership at the front, however, this order was not carried out, and Muravyev co=itted suicide.

* * The Land Committees were organised by the Order of the Prov­ isional Government of May 4, 1917, in the capital, in the gubernias, uyezds and volosts.
By setting up these committees, the Provisional Government hoped to pacify the peasants and to divert the growing peasant movement against the landlords into the channels of "voluntary agreements" between the peasants and the landlords, and thus avert the revolutionary solution of the agrarian problem by the complete abolition of landlordism.
In pursuit of this policy, the Land Committees were instructed to collect material and to draw up a scheme of-land reform to be submitted to the Constituent Assembly~ Meanwhile, the Provisional Government and the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary Parties, which joined it on May 6, 1917, declared that eyery attempt on the part ohhe peasants to solve the agrarian problem "independently," by revolutionary means, was harmful "to the cause of expedi· tions to the villages.
These measures, however, failed to pacify the country.

The growth of the revolutionary movement of the proletariat, which; under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, was marching towards the socialist revolution; the influence of the proletarian movement in the countryside; the Party's work among the masses of the soldiers and in the rural districts, and its advocacy t>f ·the slogan "alliance between the proleta•.
riat and the rural poor, and the i=ediate seizure of the land by the peasants and the placing of it at the disposal of the Soviets of Peasants' and Agri~ cultural Labourers' Deputies"; the fact that day_ after day the rural poor were joining the proletariat in increasing numbers ,and were securing i~•­ creasing influence in the peasant movement against the landlord~a¥ ·this led to the movement assuming more and more decisive forms.
Thus, proceed· ing u~der the hegemony of the revolutionary proletariat, this movement at.
the end of the su=er and in the autumn of 1917 assumed the form of genuine peasant uprisings in a number of gubernias, for example, in the Tambov, Voronezh, Tula, Kaluga, Ryazan and others.
Contrary to the e:xpec· tations of the Provisional Government and the Menshevik and ·Socialist' Revolutionary Parties, very often the Volost Land Committees took the lead in these peasant uprisings.
.
, During these uprisings the peasants took the harvest from the landlords fields and shared it among themselves; they wrecked the landlords' manor houses and divided up the property among themselves.
It should be noted that at that time prominent Right Socialist-Revolutionaries like Avksentyev and Semyon Maslov were members of the Kerensky government-Maslov hold­ ing the post of Minister for Agriculture-which sent reactionary mil:iTary forc~s to the rural districts to crush the peasant uprisings.
The leaders of the uprisings· were arrested, among them members of the Volost Land· Coin· mittees.

* Committees of Poor Peasants were instituted in the summer of 1918 in accordance with the decree of the All-Russian Central_ Executive Committee of July 11, 1918, when the Party and the Soviet government were organising the grain campaign against the kulaks.
These committees.
consisted of the poor strata of the rural population and their object was­ to unite the rural poor under the leadership of the proletariat, to fight against the kulaks, to develop the socialist revolution and strengthen the proletarian dictatorship in the rural districts.
Under the leadership of the working class and the Bolshevik Party, they were of enormous assistance in breaking the resistance of the kulaks to the socialist revolution, in preparing the ground for passing from the policy of neutralising the middle peasants to tha't of alliance between them and the proletariat, with the latter· still relying on the 1 I village poor, and in preparing for the reorganisation of the village Soviets, which often came under the influence of the kulaks, and transforming them into genuine organs of the proletarian dictatorship in the countryside.
These committees existed until the end of 1918; when they were replaced by newly elected village Soviets and V olost Executive Committees, in the elections of which the rural poor took a very active part.

* The Declaration of Rights of the Toiling and Exploited People was adopted at the Third Congress of Soviets in January 1918.
It is the fundamental thesis of the Soviet constitution.
The Declaration was drawn up by Lenin with the assistance of Stalin a~d Bukharin (for text see Selected Works, Vol.
VI).
It is a further development of Lenin's "Theses on the Constituent Assembly" (see Selected Works, Vol.
VI).
It was sub­ mitted to the Constituent Assembly on its opening on January 18, 1918, by the Chairman of the All-Russian Executive Committee of the Soviets, Y.
M.
Sverdlov, in the name of that body, but the Assembly refused to discuss it and thereby repudiated the October Revolution and the Soviet government, whereupon it was dissolved.

* In his work, Theories of Surplus Value (Vol.
II, chap.
II, "Ground Rent.
I.
Rodbertus"), Marx criticises the theory of rent advanced by the German economist Rodbertus.
Rodbertus "corrected" Ricardo and advanced the landowner as a participant.
in the creation of surplus value.
Marx says ironically that .
the origin of Rodbertus' theory of rent is to be explained by the fact that Rodbertus himself "is too much of the old Prussian landlord.
" Marx showed that, llven from the bourgeois point of view, the receivers of ground rent, i.
e.
, the landlords, are not essential participants in the capitalist process of production.
"The capitalist and the wage worker are the only participants and factors in production," says Marx.
The landlord is merely a participant in the distribution of the value of the finished product and receives part of it (part of the surplus value) in the form of ground rent.
This takes place owing to the "relationships of property in the forces of nature, which did not grow out of the capitalist method of production, but were inherited" from the preceding feudal society, in which the big landlords predominated.
Marx reveals the contradiction between private lan.
downership and the capitalist mode of production.
The ownership of land creates for the landlord privileges which "enable him to pocket part of the surplus labour, or surplus value; to the .
management of which, or creation of which, he makes no contribution .
.
That is why, in the event of collisions, the capitalist regards him as an excrescence, as a sybarite, as a parasitic ulcer on capitalist production, as a louse on his coat.
" Lenin's reference to Kautsky's "excellent MaFXian work on the agrarian question" is to a book entitled The Agrari-an Question, published in 1898.
written by Bukharin in the summer of 1918 while on a journey abroad for the purpose of establishing contacts with the Spartacus League.
These theses were distributed illegally in Germany by the Spartacus League.
Lenin refers particularly to point 24 of these theses, which stated: "Further, mention must be made of the complete alienation of the large estates.
The land and all minerals were declared to be public property.
Future tasks: the organisation of state agriculture, the collective cultivation of the former latifundia, the amalgamation of small farms into large units, and collective management (so-called agricultural communes, etc.
).

* On the night of November 9, 1918, news was received of a rev­ olution in Germany.
This was the first result in the West of the imperialist war and of the influence of the Russian October Revolution.
In the autumn of 1917, a mutiny broke out in the German naval fort at Kiel, but this was soon suppressed.
In, January 1918, a huge strike broke out in Germany in response to the declaration made by the Soviet delegation during the peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk, and in protest against the dragging out of the negotiations by the German government.
In 1918 the demand for peace and the revolutionary struggle against the German government united broad masses of the toilers in Germany.
In order to avert a revolution, the imperial government in October 1918 formed a cabinet in which it included several Social-Democrats who were followers of Scheidemann, the leader of the social-chauvinists.
All attempts to retard the development of the revolu­ tionary movement proved fruitless, however.
On November 1 a mutiny broke out in the fleet stationed at Kiel, which within a few days spread to Berlin and other important centres in Germany.
On November 9 Wilhelm abdicated and fled to Holland.
The revolution liberated Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, ,the leaders of the German Left wing, who had been flung into 30 the revolutionary workers and soldiers of Berlin proclaimed Germany a socialist republic.
A Council of Revolutionary Factory Delegates was formed, which soon after was transformed into a Soviet of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.
Soviets sprang up in a n.
umfier of other towns.
Karl Liebknecht and his group set before the revolutionary proletariat the task of fighting for a Soviet government.
But, on the one hand, the German Lefts, led by Liebknecht and Luxemburg, were far from being real Bolsheviks; they did not understand the strategy and tactics of Bolshevism and lacked the rev­ olutionary experience and firmness of the Bolsheviks Hence they com­ mitted a number of mistakes.
On the other hand, their forces were weak and unorganised.
They had only just broken with the Social-Democrats and begun to form an independent Communist Party, the inaugural congress of which was held in December 1918.
For these reasons they were unable to lead the advanced revolutionary section of the German proletariat in a Bolshevik manner and take command of the movement as a whole.
The Scheidemannists and Kautskyans retained the predominant influence among the proletariat.
After the abdication of Wilhelm, power passed into the hands of the so-called Council of People's Deputies, which consisted of Scheide­ mannists and Independent Social-Democrats (Kautskyans), and after December 28 entirely of Scheidemannists.
The Council of People's Deputies fixed the elections for the National (Constituent) Assembly for January 17, 1919, on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage and secret ballot, i.
e.
, on the basis of bourgeois democracy.
On the eve of the elections, the Berlin workers rose in rebellion, but were suppressed by the Social-Demo­ cratic government after stubborn fighting between the workers and the government troops.
During this rebellion, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxem­ burg were arrested and brutally murdered.
The petty bourgeoisie, frightened by this rebellion, voted for the bourgeois parties which promised to restore order.
The bourgeois parties formed a government jointly with the Scheide­ mann Social-Democrats, and this government led the reactionary suppression of the labour movement.
The National Assembly was an ordinary bourgeois parliament serving as a screen for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
PAGE 216.
* Anton Menger, a bourgeois professor of law in Vienna, wrote a number of works, such as A New Doctrine of the State (1903), The Right to the Full Product of Labour, Civil Law a:nd the Propertyless Classes of the P()pulation, A New Doctrine of Morality (1905), etc.
, etc.
, in which he developed his theory of "a people's labour state," which in essence in no way differed from ordinary bourgeois democracy.
Menger was one of the most important forerunners of the petty-bourgeois "Jurist Socialists," who devel­ oped the theory of the peaceful, "legal" evolution of capitalism into socialist society by means of the "democratisation of the politically and economically coercive adopted by the German Social-Democratic Party at its Congress in Gotha in 1875.
It was borrowed from Lassalle and hi:s followers, with whom the German Marxists, or Eisenachers, as they were called, united at that time.
This slogan served as a substitute for the Marxian idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat and was very severely criticised by Marx in his letter to Bracke of May 5, 1875, and also by Engels in his letter to Behel of March 18-28, 1875.
See Marx's Critique of the Catha Programme.
Lenin deals with this slogan in detail in chaps.
I and JV of The State and Revolution, in this volume.

* The article " 'Democracy' and Dictatorship," published in Pravda, No.
2, January 3, 1919, was written by Lenin in the period when a revolutionary situation prevailed in Germany and Austria at the end of 1918.
Beginning with the November days in 1918, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses of the workers in Germany and Austria continued to grow, but the majority of the workers were under the influence of the Social-Democrats who had long before betrayed the cause of socialism.
The leadership of the majority of the workers was either in the hands of the Scheidemannists who were determined not to allow the struggle for the proletarian dictator­ ship to develop and to suppress the proletarian revolution, or in the hands of the Centrist Kautskyans (the "Independent" Social-Democrats) who, by word and deed, helped the Scheidemannists and echoed them in preaching "pure," i.
e.
, bourgeois democracy which served to turn the masses of the workers from the struggle for the proletarian dictatorship.
The only party that set the masses of the workers in town and country the task of fighting for the dictatorship of the proletariat in the form of Soviets was the Com­ munist Party of Germany led by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.
But this party had only just been formed; it was far from being a genuine Bolshevik party, it committed a number of "Left" mistakes and was still weak and unable to direct the movement as a whole.
In this article Lenin shows the unity of the Social-Democrats of both shades (Scheidemannists and Kautskyans) in defending the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and fighting against the dictatorship of the proletariat.
PAGE 223.
* Lenin's theses and report _on "Bourgeois Democracy and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" submitted to the First Congress of the Communist International (March 2-6, 1919) very distinctly dissociate the fundamental principles of revolutionary Marxism-Leninism from all pseudo· Marxian views on the fundamental question of ·the proletarian revolution, namely, the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
The First Congress of the .
Communist International was held in the period of great class battles all over the world.
In all countries the proletariat was waging an offensive against the capitalist system and the bourgeois state.
On the 30* the Soviets as the form of organisation of their offensive operations.
But the young Communist Parties which had only just been formed, which had not yet expanded into mass organisations, had not yet become Bolshevised and had not yet acquired .
Sufficient fighting experience, were not in a position to exercise their leadership over the broad mass movement.
Owing to this, an important role in the leadership of the mass movement was played by various alleged "Left" Kautskyan groups in the Social-Demo­ cratic parties.
They preached to the proletariat that it was necessary to preserve "pure" democracy and tried to persuade it that it was possible to combine the latter with Soviets, and in this way disarmed the proletariat in the struggle against bourgeois democracy, i:e.
, in the struggle against the rule of the bourgeoisie and for the rule of the Soviets.
This alleged "Left" position was most strikingly revealed among the German Kautskyans who at that time were organised in the Independent Social-Democratic Party led by Kautsky, Hilferding and Co.
Lenin criticises the position of these "Independents" in detail in the present theses.
The main object of these theses was to show the antithesis between bourgeois democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat, between the bour­ geois state and the proletarian, Soviet state.
The theses concentrated attention upon the fundamental questio~ of the proletarian revolution, viz.
, the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Soviet power as the form of this dictatorship, and on combating the false hopes the masses of the workers in the West placed in bourgeois parliamentarism and bourgeois democracy.
On the basis of a distinct interpretation of the nature of the class tasks of the proletariat in the socialist revolution, the division between the adherents oi the Communist International and its opponents became still wider.
PAGE 228.
* Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, the leaders of the German proletariat, were arrested in January 1919, during the rebellion of the Berlin workers and soldiers against the Social-Democratic government.
On the way to prison they were brutally murdered by the oflicero who had charge of them.
The murderers were tried by court-martial, but were acquitted.
The responsibility for this murder and for the acquittal of the murderers rested entirely upon the Social-Democrats.
PAGE 229.
* For a long time Switzerland was regarded as the freest of bourgeois countries.
Owing to the peasant character of the population, the comparatively slow development of the rule of large-scale industrial and bank capital, the relatively slight centralisation of the administration.
and the lack of a strong administrative apparatus as a result of this, formal bourgeois liberties are enjoyed most fully in that country.
Before and during the war, Switzerland was a haven of refuge for political emigrants, who were exempt from the operation of the extradition law, hut in 1919, when the revolutionary movement in Switz~J,:land itself assumed menacing proportions Federation has the right to expel from its territory aliens who are a menace to the internal.
·or external safety of Switzerland.
" In this way the Swiss bourgeoisie tried to get rid of the revolutionary emigrants who took an active part in the Swiss labour movement.
PAGE 230.
* Democracy in the republics of ancient Greece was democracy for the slave-owners.
The National Assembly, the organ of the democratic government which decided the affairs of state, con~isted exclusively of "free­ men" who constituted a minority of the populatron.
Among the freemen there dominated the big owners of land and slaves.
Slaves, and also the inhabitants of conquered territories, enjoyed no right whatever to take part in the adlninistration of the state.
Democracy in the cities of the Middle Ages was a form of municipal gov­ ernment exercised by the merchant and handicraft guildsmen.
In this case also formal democracy was merely a cloak to conceal the rule of the rich burghers.
.
Democracy in developed bourgeois countries differs from precedm~ forms of democracy owing to the fact that under the former the formal rr.
g~t to take part in the administration of the state is" ~njoye~ by nearly_ all c1t~zens.
Thus, under bourgeois democracy formal equality achieves the.
w1.
dest dim_en­ sions.
Actually, however, this democracy serves to protect capitalist exploita­ tion it serves as a cloak to conceal the rule of the bourgeoisie.
Under bour­ geois democracy it is big capital that rules.
· While proclaiming democratic liberties-free speech, freedom of assembly, free press, etc.
-the bourgeoisie knows that the broad masses of the toilers cannot enjoy these liberties be­ cause the necessary requirements for it-premises, printing offices, etc.
-are the private property of the capitalists.
Bourgeois liberties, bourgeois democrac'.
, are simply a means of deceiving the toiling masses.
In actual fact bourgeois democracy is merely democracy for the rich minority, democracy for the capitalists.
• Thus although its forms have changed, democracy has been and is democra~y for the ruling minority of the population and an .
inst:ument for the oppression of the exploited majority.
~uly after the pro~eta:ian revolu­ tion and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletarrat m the form of a Soviet republic, are the broad masses of the toilers really bro~ght into the work of administering the state.
Proletarian democracy alone is demo­ cracy for the toiling majority of the population.
PAGE 231.
* In January 1918, a general political strike broke out in Germany.
At the very beginning of the strike workers' ~oviets (Rate~ were elec~ed.
The role of these first German Soviets was restncted to leadmg the stnke move­ ment and when the strike came to an end their activities ceased.
In the ]Je~nning of November l918 a new moveI!J.
ent for the form11tion of Soviets the centre of the revolutionary movement in the navy and m the towns on the Baltic coast.
During the rebellion in Kiel the Sailors' and Soldiers' Council became the real power in the town and in the fleet; it controlled the police, the food supplies, etc.
At that time also power in Hamburg passed into the hands of the Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.
_ Under the influence of the rebellion in Kiel a Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies was elected in Bremen and Council:;, of Soldiers' Deputies were elected in Liibeck and Brunsbiittel.
On Novem­ ?er 5, 1918, a general strike started in Berlin and in other industrial cities 1n Germany.
At first the centre of the movement was the Berlin Council of revolutionary representatives of big factories which very soon was trans· forme~ into the Berlin Council of Workers' Deputies.
Following Berlin, Councils of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies began to spring up in all indus­ trial cities.
The development of the activities of the Soviets inevitably brought them into conflict with the existing state apparatus.
That is why the govern­ mental Social-Democrats, who stood for a bourgeois parliamentary state, did all they possibly could to prevent the role of the Soviets from increasing.
The Independents (Kautskyans) tried to combine parliamentarism with the Soviet system.
The Spartacus League (which later became the Communist Party of Germany) alone put up a real fight to transfer power to the Soviets.
Owing to the strong influence exercised by the Social-Democrats and the weakness of the Communist organisations, the leading role in the Soviets was taken by the Right Social-Democrats and the Independents.
Under their leadership the congresses of the German Soviets were held, the First Con­ gress in December 1918, and the Second Congress in April 1919.
The Com­ munist Party of Germany failed to capture the Soviets from the German Mensheviks in the way the Russian Bolshevik Party captured the Soviets in Russia from the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in 1917.
The German Soviets were not transformed into organs of rebellion and for the seizure of power by the proletariat.
They expired without becoming organs of the proletarian dictatorship.
PAGE 231.
** Shop Stewards' Committees were formed by the revolutionary workers in Great Britain during the imperialist World War.
During the war the British trade unions, adopting the position of social-patriotism, proclaimed a class truce and abandoned the strike struggle in order not to hamper the bourgeoisie in the pursuit of the war.
The revolutionary elements in the trade union movement, however, were opposed to this peace with the bourgeoisie and organised strikes in defence of the workers' interests.
These strikes were led by the Shop Stewards' Committees and Workers' Councils which functioned independently of and in opposition to the official trade 1mion bodies.
In many places the Shop Stewards' Committees were under Communist influence.
After the--October Revolution in Russia the idea of fqrmin~ a system of Shop Stewards' Committees throu~hout the elements of the British working class.
Communist influence, however, was very weak in the labour movement at that time, whereas the influence of the anti-Communist parties like the Labour Party and the Independent Labour Party was very strong.
The result '\Yas that Soviets were not formed in Great Britain.
PAGE 234.
* The Berne Conference of the Second International took place in February 1919, and was the first international socialist conference to be called after the war.
It was convened for the purpose of restoring the Second lnternationai.
Ninety-eight delegates were present from various countries, including representatives of the Kautskyan Centrists.
Delegates of the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, with Kautsky at their head, were also present.
The conference bore a strongly marked chauvinist character and wholly adhered to the position of serving the imperialist bourgeoisie in the fight against the proletarian revolution.
It tried to fix responsibility for the war and granted "mutual amnesty" to both belligerent sides and to the Socialist Parties of both sides.
On the colonial question it adopted a resolution moved by Ka]ltsky in which the exploitation of the colonies hy the imperialists was declared to be inevitable and only needed mitigation.
On the question of labour protection laws the conference decided to take part in a conference that was to be ·convened by the capitalists and the governments of the Entente.
It was· only owing to the protest of the opposition group (numbering twenty delegates) that this conference rejected a resolution moved by Kautsky, Bernstein and the re­ presentatives of the Russian Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, con­ demning the proletarian revolution and by that openly taking the side of imperialist intervention and internal counter-revolution in Soviet Russia.
PAGE 236.
* In the period from March to July 1917, the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries had an overwhelming majority in the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.
This was the case also at the First All' Russian Congress of Soviets at which the Bolsheviks had only 103 delegates out of 709,.
i.
e.
, only 13 per cent.
But already at that time the overwhelming majority of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries no longer reflected the real relation of influence of these parties and that of the Bolsheviks among the masses of workers and soldiers.
Long before the July days the Bolsheviks had been making enormous strides in winning over the proletariat and the soldiers.
This was reflected in the demonstration in Petrograd on April 21, and it was manifested on an enormous scale in the great demon­ stration of June 18, at the very time the First Congress of Soviets was in session.
This demonstration was organised under the slogans of the Bol­ sheviks: Thus, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries began to lose their leadership in the Soviets before the July days.
After the July days, the country, and very quickly captured the Soviets of Workers' and· Soldiers' Deput~es.
As the Mensheviks lost their; power in the Soviets, they ceased to praise them as organs of "revolutionary democracy.
" · PAGE 239.
* In advancing the slogan of "Peasant Soviets;" the German Social· Pemocrats _and Scheidemannists pursued the very definite object of opposing the revolutionary labour movement by Peasant Soviets led by the rich farmers and in this way preserving their own influence in the rural districts.
As i: known, the main strategic slogan of the Bolsheviks in Russia in the period from th: Febru~ry Revolution to the October Revolution was the slogan of the .
dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasants, from which logic­ ally followed the unification of the rural labourers and poor peasants with the urban proletariat.
With this end in view, Lenin, as far back as April 1917, set the task of organising Soviets of Agricultural Labourers and Poor Peas­ ants,_ and .
.
l_ater ag~cultural labourers' unions.
As Lenin says, the German Com­ mumsts, m advancmg the slogan of Soviets of Agricultural Labourers and Poor Peasants as against the Scheidemann slogan of "Peasant Soviets," followed the same.
path as.
that pursued by the Russian Bolshevik Party in the fight for the dictatorship of the proletariat.

* * * Lenin here refers to the Decree on the Land adopted by the Sec· ond Congress of Soviets on November 8 [October 26], ]917, i.
e.
, on the very next da! after the October Revolution.
The Decree abolished the private ownership of large estates without compensation and placed these estates as we!~ a~ the lands of the· tsar, the monasteries and the churches, with all their hve_ and dead stock, and buildings, at the disposal of the V olost La~d Committees and U~ezd Soviets of Peasants' Deputies.
Thus, the desires of the peasants which had been expressed in numerous Instructions to their representatives elected at peasant meetings and Soviets, viz.
, that the_ land be tal:en from the landlords and transferred to the peasants for the1~ use, were immediately satisfied.
For the purpose of guiding the intro­ ductrn~ of the_ agrarian reform, Point 4 of the Decree on the Land provided model mstructions th.

Like all Lenin's works on the dictatorship of the proletariat, it was directed against Russian and international, tacit and avowed Centrist reformism which renounced the core of Marxism, viz.
, its "doctrine of the revolutionary dictatorship in general and the dictatorship of the proletariat in particular.
" It shows that from its very inception Bolshevism always made this the key­ stone of its principles and that long ago it began to develop the doctrine of the dictatorship on the basis of the experience of the international revo­ lutionary movement in general, and of the Russian Revolution of 1905-07 in particular.
PAGE 241.
* * In the programme of the Russian Social-Democratic Party adopted at the Second Party Congress in April 1903, the question of the dictatorship of the proletariat was formulated as follows: "Having substituted the social ownership of the means of production and exchange for private ownership, and having introduced the planned organisation of the social production pro­ cess in order to ensure the well-being and all-sided development of all the members of society, the proletarian social revolution will abolish the division of society into classes and thereby emancipate the whole of oppressed human­ ity, for it will put an end to all forms of exploitation of one section of society by another.
A necessary condition for this social revolution is the dictator­ ship of the proletariat, i.
e.
, the conquest by the proletariat of such political power as will enable it to suppress all resistance on the part of the exploiters.

* This refers to the German Revolution of 1848.
In March 1848, a rebellion broke out in Berlin, then the capital of Prussia, which was the largest of the German states.
It failed, however, to overthrow the mon­ archy, but it compelled the king of Prussia to promise "freedom" and to convene a parliament.
At the same time the new Ministry was formed which included two representatives of the liberal bourgeoisie, Camphausen and Hansemann.
Camphausen became head of the Ministry.
Marx described Camphausen's "March Ministry" as the Ministry of the "big bourgeoisie.
" And what the German big bourgeoisie and the German bourgeoisie in general represented at that time can be seen from Marx's characterisation of them quoted in explanatory note to p.
186** in this volume.
It was in­ capable of "acting in a dictatorial manner" but was only capable of strik­ ing a bargain with the counter-revolution and of betraying the revolution that was being made by the workers and peasants.
In the same issue of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung to which Lenin refers, Marx wrote: "The people permitted the formation of a Ministry of the big bourgeoisie, and the big bourgeoisie, anti-revolutionary as of old, out of fear of the people, i.
e.
, out .
of fear of the workers and the democratic burghers, concluded a defensive and offensive alliance with reaction.
" Reaction triumphed, first in Prus.
sia (as early as November 1848) and later over the whole of Germany, with the direct assistance of the bourgeoisie and particularly with the assistance of, fir·st, the bourgeois Ministry of Camphausen and later of the Hansemann and subsequent Ministries.

* * The resolution on the provisional revolutionary government ad­ opted at the Third Congress of the R.
S.

P.
in 1905 stated: "Subject to the relation of forces, and other factors which cannot be exactly determined beforehand, representatives of our Party may participate in the provisional revolutionary government for the purpose of ruthlessly combating all counter­ revolutionary attempts and of defending the independent interests of the working class.
" Irrespective of whether the participation of Social-Democrats in the provisional revolutionary government would prove possible or not, the resolution urged the necessity of "permanent pressure being brought to bear upon the provisional government by the armed proletariat led by Social-Democracy, for the purpose of defending, consolidating and extend­ ing the gains of the revolution.
" (Selected Works, Vol III, p.
47.
) Thus, it clearly emphasised the necessity of demanding of the provisional rev­ olutionary government that it wage an active, ruthless &truggle against counter-revolution-the necessity--of dictatorship.
By a provisional govern­ ment in which the party of the proletariat could participate, the resolution I I l I of the Bolsheviks meant a government d the revolutionary democratic dictatorship of the working class and the peasantry.
(Cf.
"The Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolution" and "Social-Democracy and the Provisional Revolutionary Government," in Selected W arks, Vol.
III.
) The resolution adopted by the Ivienshevik Conference, which was held simultaneously with the Third Congress of the Party, started out from an entirely different posit-ion.
In the opinion of the Mensheviks, who at that time were opposed to participation in a provisional revolutionary government, such a government would only be a bourgeois government and "would not only have to push revolutionary development further forward in regulating the mutual struggle of the conflicting classes of the emancipated nation, but also to fight against those of its factors which threaten the foundations of the capitalist regime.
" Unlike the resolution of the Bolsheviks, the Menshe­ vik resolution did not contain a single word about the need for a ruthless struggle against counter-revolution.
Hence, the Mensheviks restricted the functions of the provisional government, and consequently the functions of the revolution to the establishment and protection of the capitalist system.
A detailed' analysis of the Menshevik resolution on the provisional revo­ lutionary government and the arguments for the resolution of the Bolsheviks are given in Lenin's work The Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in th_e Demo­ cratic Revolution in Selected W arks, Vol.
III.

*** Marx here refers to the Frankfort National Assembly, which was convened after the revolution in Germany in March 1848 for the purpose of drawing up a constitution for the whole of Germany.
In the main, the Assembly consisted of state officials of the pre-revolutionary period and of representatives of the bourgeoisie.
Among_ the deputies there were many university professors, which gave Marx cause for ironically calling the Fr_ank­ fort Assembly a "learned assembly.
" The majority in the Assembly consisted of the liberal bourgeoisie who betrayed all the traits of cowardice in the face of reaction, fear of the revolutionary movement of the workers and peasants and treachery towards this movement, and of bargaining with the crown f~r which the German bourgeoisie of that time was distinguished.
(See note to p.

" In bis pamphlet The Two Tactics of Social­ Democracy in the Democratic Revolution (Selected W arks, Vol.

, the deputies of the National Assembly.

] utt~red fine words adopted all" sorts of democratic 'decisions,' 'constituted' all kmds of libertie~ while in reality they left power in the hands of the king and failed to or"anise an armed struggle against the armed forces at the dis­ posal of the" king.
And while the Frankfort Osvobozhdeniye-ists were prat­ tling, the king bided his time, consolidated his military forces, and the counter-revolution, relying on real force, utterly routed the democrats with all their beautiful 'decisions.

* P.
Struve (then a Cadet) opposed "violence from the Left" and "the strike committees of the revolutionary parties" in an article entitled "Two Strike Committees" published in No.
3 of the Cadet journal Polyar­ naya Zvezda (The North Star) of January 12, 1906.
[December 30, 1905].
This article, as it were, served as the reply of the Cadets to the December armed insurrection in Moscow.
Expressing indignation at the "violence from the Left," Struve in this article accuses the revolutionary parties of damag­ ing and undermining the cause of the revolution by this violence.
In refer­ ring to the translation of the word "dictatorship" by the words "reinforced guard" Lenin had in mind the speech delivered by the Cadet professor A.
Kiesewetter at a meeting in Moscow in February 1906.
Replying to the Social-Democratic speakers, Kiesewetter said, among other things: "How­ ever much they may try to soften the meaning of the word 'dictatorship' of the proletariat, they cannot do so.
Dictatorship is a Latin word which in Russian means 'chrezvichainaya okhrana' (reinforced guard) and wherever else one may be tempted with this, it is not in Moscow.
" Thus, already in 1906, the Cadet professor placed dictatorship on a par with the worst expression of the tsarist police regime with its okhrana (secret police) and gendarmerie.

* The "Bulygin Duma" was the name given to the legislative­ advisory State Duma that was to have been set up in accordance with the law drafted by the then Minister for the Interior, Bulygin, and promulgated on August 19 [6], 1905, but which was prevented by the October general strike.
This legislative-advisory body was to have served as a new bureau­ cratic accessory to the bureaucratic State Council.
The elections to this Duma were to have been based on a very high property qualification, as a consequence of which, as Lenin said, it could have been only "an advisory assembly of representatives of the landlords and the big bourgeoisie, elected under the supervision and with the aid of the lackeys of the absolutist government on the basis of an electoral system so indirect, with so many reactionary rank and property ·qualifications, that it is a downright mockery of the idea of popular representation.
'' (Selected Works, Vol.
III, P-319.
) The Bolsheviks declared an active boycott of the Bulygin Duma, whereas the Mensheviks adopted the confused opportunist position of: I) taking advantage of the elections in order to bring pressure upon the electors to induce them to elect supporters of a democratic representative body and 2) organising unofficial elections for the purpose of creating local "revolu­ tionary self-governing bodies," and subsequently a Constituent Assembly.

*** By "constitution" Lenin means the tsar's manifesto of October 17, 1905, which was promulgated as a result of the October general strike and which promised the convocation of a popular representative assembly and the granting of the franchise to the workers, and also the new law on the State Duma and the elections for it issued by Witte (in place of the Bulygin law referred to above) during the armed insurrection in Moscow.

* Lenin here refers to an actual historical fact.
Maria Spirido­ nova, a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, was arrested in 1905 on the charge of assassinating a government official named Luzhenovsky, who was in charge of operations in suppressing the peasant movement in the Tambov Gubernia.
While under arrest Spiridonova was brutally tortured by the Cossack officer Avramov, who was afterwards assassinated by the.
Socialist-Revolutionaries.
PAGE 255.
* Lenin here refers to the active servants of the tsarist regime during the 1905 Revolution.
The case of Avramov is explained in the preced­ ing note.
Durnovo, Minister for the Interior in the Witte Cabinet, was the official who directed all the operations for suppressing the 1905 Revolu­ tion.
Admiral Dubasov was an extreme reactionary who suppressed the peasant uprisings in a number of gubernias.
While Governor-General of Moscow he acquired special notoriety for his suppression of the December armed insurrection in Moscow and by his organisation of punitive expeditions which shot workers without trial.
Min, commander of the Semyonov Life Guard regiment, was in direct charge of the troops which suppressed the December uprising in Moscow and gave the order "take no prisoners," i.
e.
, to shoot on the spot all the revolutionary workers who fell into the hands of the soldiers.

* Lenin here ridicules the cringing before bourgeois laws which is characteristic of all philistines, and which is supported by bourgeois science.
Bourgeois.
science of law does not explain the social roots of the laws which are in operation, nor does it reveal the class interests which these laws serve.
Its object is merely to interpret the letter of these laws, not to criticise them.
At the same time, bourgeois science worships laws which protect the interests of the propertied classes.
These laws are sacred for it; and it condemns every action which infringes or exceeds the bound­ aries of bourgeois law and order.
Hence, in the main, bourgeois science of law serves the purpose of fixing in the minds of the ordinary person the prejudice that the laws of the bourgeois state and the social system which these laws protect are immutable.

* General strike committees were formed in 1905 in the big indus­ trial centres for the purpose of uniting the strike movement in all the enter­ prises in the given town or district.
It was under their leadership that the great wave of general political strikes spread.
As a rule, these general strike committees arose before the Soviets of Workers' Deputies and, as was the case in Ivanovo-Voznesensk, for example, they served as the basis for the creation of these Soviets.

* This refers to the period of the first Witte State Duma (in 1906-see note on p.
527 in Selected Works, Vol.
III) when the Cadets enthusiastically praised "the constitution (save the mark)" as Lenin ex­ pressed it, and spread illusions about this State Duma being a parliament, when as a matter of fact it was only an advisory body under the tsar's govern­ ment.
In the same pamphlet which Lenin here refers to-"The Victory of the Cadets and the Tasks of the Workers' Party"-he wrote: ·'The special features of the present situation in the Russian revolution are precisely that the objective conditions bring to the forefront the decisive extra-parliament­ ary struggle for parliamentarism, and therefore, in such a situation, nothing is more harmful and dangerous than constitutional illusions and playing at parliamentarism.

* The steamship subsidy.
The question of subsidising steamship companies which maintained intercourse with East Asia, Australia and Africa gave rise to a very acute internal party struggle in the ranks of the German Social-Democratic Party in 1885.
·In demanding a vote of 4,400,000 marks for the purpose of these subsidies, the German government pursued the aim of exploiting the colonial and semi-colonial countries, of widening Germany's sphere of influence in them.
To vote for these subsidies meant supporting the colonial policy of the German bourgeoisie and the plunder of the oppressed nations in the colonies and semi-colonies.
The majority of the members of the Sociai-Democratic fraction in the German Reichstag, as well as the whole of the Right wing of the German Social-Democratic Party which had already grown up at that time, adopted this opportunist position of supporting the colonial policy of the bourgeoisie.
The minority in the fraction, however, supported by the central organ of the party, the Sozial­ demokrat, which was then published in Switzerland (this was the period of the Anti-Socialist Law in Germany), started a struggle against this opportun­ ist position.
The energetic intervention of Engels led to the victory of the minority; the Reichstag fraction as a whole was compelled to vote against the steamship subsidies.
The-struggle within the Reichstag fraction and of it, that Engels, not for the first time, raised the question of the need for pursuing a course towards a split from this Right wing.
In his letter to Sorge of June 3, 1885, he wrote: "Concerning your parliamentarians, you had the same correct presentiment as I had-on the question of the debates on the steamship subsidies; they revealed colossal philistine appetites.
Things almost reached a split, which now, while the Anti-Socialist Law is in opera­ tion, would be undesirable.
But as soon as we in Germany get a little elbow room, a split will of course take place, and then it will be only useful.
" (Our italics.
) In his letter to Behel in July of the same year, he very severely attacked Wilhelm Liebknecht, who at that time played the role of a conciliator in the internal party struggle.
Engels again wrote that a split from the opportunists was inevitable and necessary.
Expressing irony at the expense of Wilhelm Liebknecht, he wrote: "In the whole of this business [Liebknecht] is playing the comic role of the hen who hatched ducklings: he wanted to hatch 'educated' Socialists, but lo, only philistines emerged from the eggs.
.
.
.
The only result that will come of all this will be that the party will realise that two trends exist within it, of which one gives direction to the masses and the other gives direction to the so-called leaders, and that these two trends are diverging more and more.
By this the sub­ sequent split will be prepared, and this is very good.
" (Our italics.
) As is well known, after Marx and Engels, the consietent Marxist Bolsheviks, __ ____-­ headed by Lenin, were the only ones to continue and carry out the line for a split, for a rupture with the opportunists in Russia, in the German Social-Democratic Party, and in the whole of the Second Inter­ national.

** The "Young" Socialists were a "Left" opportunist trend in the German Social-Democratic Party which began to take shape during the period of operation of the Anti-Socialist Law (1878-90) and which made itself felt particularly as an opposition group within the party in the begin­ ning of the 1890's.
Fostered by the growth of Right opportunism in the German Social-Democratic Party, and opposing it, this "Left" oppositio.

Mueller, the brothers Wille and others) was itself a typical representative of petty-bourgeois revolutionariness drifting into anarchism similar to that of the otzovists, ultimatumists and V peryod-ists in Russia in the period of reaction.
Engels, continuing the fight on two fronts which he and Marx had waged, while scourging Right opportunism in the German Social-Democratic Party and conciliation with this opportunism in the leading circles of the party, at the same time sharply attacked the "Left" opportunism, the anarchist tendencies and revolutionary phrase­ mongering of the "Young" Socialists.
Subsequently, this group was expelled from the party and some of them drifted into anarchism, while others drifted into Right opportunism.

* The Third Congress of Soviets took place in Petrograd on Jan­ uary 23-31 D0-18], 1918, following the dispersion of the Right Socialist­ Revolutionary Constituent Assembly which rejected the October Revolution and the Soviet government and was in its turn rejected by the masses of the workers and peasants (see "Theses on the Constituent Assembly" and the speech and decree on its dissolution, and also.
the explanatory notes to them, in Selected Works, Vol.
VI).
The Congress of Soviets met at the end of the first stage of the proletarian revolution, which, as Lenin said, was "a continuous triumphal procession.
" The congress served to consolidate the victory of the revolution for the period, to define the tasks of the Soviet government for the immediate future.
At the time of the Third Congress of Soviets the international situation of Soviet Russia was that she was emerging from the imperialist war, but had not yet entirely emerged.
It was necessary, at the price of extremely costly concessions, to purchase a respite, to take cover against the advancing forces of German imperialism (Entente imperialism was not yet able to throw its forces directly into the effort to suppress the Soviet government), and to set to work to restore national economy, to create the foundation for socialist economy and to strengthen the defence of the country.
The peace negotiations with Germany that were proceeding at the time of the Third Congress of Soviets served this purpose.
At this time, as a result of the influence of the revolution in Russia and the extreme suffering .
caused by the imperialist war, the revolutionary temper of the masses in the capitalist countries rose to a high pitch, and this found expression in Germany, in January 1918, in a series of strikes and uprisings under the slogan of Soviet government.
This increased the chances of Soviet Russia obtaining a respite.
The relation of class forces within the country was obviously in favour of the revolution.
In the principal and decisive centres the proletariat had broken the resistance of the deposed ruling classes and had successfully completed the first stage of the Civil War.
In the Ukraine, Kuban, the Don, in Siberia and in the 'Far East, the Red Guards had routed the White Guard forces and were marching forward victoriously, thanks to the universal support they obtained from the workers and the rural poor.
In addition to the overthrow of the rule of the landlords and of all the remnants of tsarism and feudalism in the rural districts, considerable successes had already been achieved in the fulfilment of the fundamental socialist tasks of the revolution.
In his report Lenin described the results of the economic policy of the proletariat during the three months of its dictatorship as an enormous "step _f2rward to socialism.
" Having captured order to proceed with its work of socialist construction the proletariat needed a certain period in whic~ to accumulate.
organisational experience in the management of industry.
D~ring this period of transition .
the proletarian government intended to ut_ilise the experience of those capitalists who were willing to_ come to some agree_­ ment with the proletaria"n dictatorship.
This explains why the nationalisa_­ .
tion of the banks and ·the nationalisation of _industry_ were pre.
ceded by the decree on.
workers' control of industry.
Workers' control of industry (see note to p.
277**) served as a mighty instrllinent for the education ~nd train­ ing of the ~orking class for the management of industry, and it.
created the prerequisites for the transition to_ the latter.
On December 14 [l], 1917, the Supreme Council of National Economy was already formed.
In the words of Lenin, this body was.
to serve in economics "as a fighting orga:1 for .
the .
struggle against the landlords and capitalists just as the Council of People's Commissars is in politics.
" At that time.
the nation~lis_ation of industry w.
as not yet being.
carried out in a planned manner; It took t~e form of a series of measures against the .
capitalists who refused to silbnnt to the decrees.
of the proletarian state.
The nationalisation of the ban1:'s was .
brought about on .
December 27 [14], and on February 8_ [January 2~], 1918, the capital of the private banks was confiscated (see note to P· ~76···) · Lenin regarded the nationalisation of the .
banks and the introduction of workers' control of industry as "the first step towards.
socialism.
" .
.
··Simultaneously ~ith these measures, the proletariat broke up the ?Id state machine of the exploiters and created a new type of state power which was of world-historical significance, viz.
, the .
Soviet prol_etarian state.
_ .
.
.
In fhe · niidst ~f fierce .
struggles, and overcoming the _resistance and sabotag_e of the deposed class~s, the masses of the workers learned to administe_r.
the state.
It was necessary to do everything to encourage.
and develop ~e iniJiati~e of the proletariat in building the new organs of the .
proletarian powe;: ~nd.
to assist· it in overconiing the old prejudice .
that only the former rttling ~lasses can administer .
the state.
Lenin regarded this task as one of the most important tasks, and dealt with the manner in which it .
'_Vas ~o b~ fulfilled in his speeches at the Third Congress of_ Soviets, and m his utte~ances before and after it.
Thus, in his artii;le.
"How to Organise Com­ petition" ·he wrote: "We must at all costs_ smash the old, stupid, savage, de_spicable and disgusting prejudice that only the so-i;:alled 'upp~r classes,'.
only the rich, or those who have passed thn;mgh the scho()l ()f th.

1 I, period of work of the Soviet government and indicates the path on which the further consolidation of the proletarian dictatorship could be achieved, but also because it indicates the forms and the conditfons of the transition from capitalism to socialism.
In this report Lenin raised and solved a number of important problems of the transition period, such as: formulating the reasons of the necessity for a transition period from capitalism to socialism; the difficulties of this transition to socialism and the class struggle that must be waged in the process; the role of violence and terror; democracy and dictatorship; the alliance between the proletariat and the.
masses of the peasantry; the significance of the new type of state; the forms of the transition of the small peasants to socialism; and the final victory of socialism.
The Third Congress served as a striking demonstration of the victory of Bolshevik ideas.
Out of a total of 1,046 delegates with decisive and consultative votes, 61 per cent were Bolsheviks.
The items on the agenda at the congress were as follows: 1) Report of the Central Executive Committee (Y.
M.
Sverdlov), 2) Declaration of Rights of the Toiling and Exploited People, 3) Report of the Council of People's Commissars (Lenin), 4) Report on War and Peace, 5) Report on the Federative Soviet Republic and on the National Question (Stalin), 6) Election of the Central Executive Committee.
The results of the congress confirmed the fact that "the Soviet power is not an invention, not a Party trick, but the result of the development of life itself, the result of the spontaneous moulding of the world revolution.

* Throughout the history of the revolutionary labour movement the intensification of the class struggle of the proletariat against the bour­ geoisie, and every attempt on the part of the proletariat to take power, was always accompanied by terrible crimes against the workers and the shooting down of workers, i.
e.
, by the mass terror of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat.
In the history of the French labour movement, to which Lenin refers here, the orgy of brutal White terror let loose to suppress the June uprising of the workers of Paris in 1848 and the suppression of the Paris Commune in 1871, when nearly 35,000 workers were exterminated and about 50,000 were imprisoned and sent to penal servitude, were outstanding.
Mass White terror, carried out by the hand of the German Social-Democratic Party and its "bloodhound" Noske, accompanied the suppression of the uprising of the Berlin workers in January 1918, and White terror, also carried out by the hand of the Social-Democrats, accompanied the suppression of the revolutionary proletariat of Germany (particularly in the Ruhr) when, after having with its own forces liquidated the attempted.
monarchist coup in the spring of 1921, it tried to wage a struggle for a Soviet government in Germany.
Terror also rag~ during the suppression of wherever the bourgeoisie and the landlords, assisted by the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries and by foreign interventionist forces, succeeded,.
even if only for a very brief period, in overthrowing the Soviet government, and wherever the White Guards ruled.
Every Communist they captured was tortured to death; tens of thousands of workers and peasants were shot, beaten with ramrods and thrown into filthy dungeons, their wives and daughters were raped, whole villages were razed to the ground and brutal pogroms against the Jews were organised.
White terror did not cease in the capitalist countries even after the period of revolutionary struggles of 1919-23.
According to the returns of the Central Committee of the International Labour Defence from 1925 to 1929 the number of victims of White terror (sentenced to death, murdered, tortured, maimed, wounded) steadily grew from 120,167 in 1925 to 367,479 in 1929.
With the outbreak of the world economic crisis in 1929, the revival of the revolutionary movement and the growth of the revolutionary crisis in a number of capitalist countries, White terror increased to unprecedented dimensions and raged with particular fury in those countries where the fas­ cists came into power or were coming into power.
Not long ago Poland occupied first place among the countries in which White terror rages; now her place has been taken by fascist Germany.
The Hitler terror against the revolutionary proletariat of Germany, and against the Communist Party which is leading it, can only be compared with the White Guard terror during the Civil War in Russia.
PAGE 270.
* * The sabotage of government officials and officials in rural and urban administrative bodies, as well as of the office employees of private capitalist enterprises (banks, syndicates, river transport, private railways) which passed into the hands of the new proletarian state, began immediately after the October Revolution and assumed a variety of forms (strikes, refusal to obey the orders of the Soviet government, leaving work without permission).
It was carried out by the bourgeoisie through the medium of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who were the actual organisers of it.
It spread to all categories of officials and office employees, including the technical intelligentsia, teachers, professors, doctors, etc.
Owing to the generous financial support it received from the capitalists (the bankers and manufactur· ers) and the landlords, it continued persistently and on a fairly wide scale during the first three or four months after the October Revolution, but finally it was broken by the power of the proletarian dictatorship.
In the period of the Civil War of 1918-20, sabotage, as a form of· re· sistance of the deposed classes to the dictatorship of the proletariat, accompanied by the organisation of armed fighting, was superseded by the armed struggle against the Soviet government and the organisation of counter· revolutionary plots in the Soviet rear.
In the final stages of the period of-31 * of the New Economic Policy (1927-30), sabotage was revived in a new form, in the form of wrecking by bourgeois specialists on the socialist con­ struction front; and this was accompanied by the general intensification of· the class struggle and resistance of the capitalist elements in the country to the socialist offensive of the proletariat, as well as by an increase in international imperialist strivings directed against the U.

* Kerensky fled from Petrograd to Pskov even before the Winter Palace was occupied by the Bolshevik forces on November 7 [October 25], 1917.
He thought it would be possible to move the t_roops at the front against the Bolsheviks; but the troops refused to march against them.
The ouly support he found was that of General Krasnov, the Commander-in-Chief of the Third Cavalry Corps consisting of Cossacks.
On November 10 [October 28], Krasnov occupied Gatchina.
On November 12 [October 30], the battle of Pulkovo took place in which the Cossacks suffered heavy losses.
An armistice was concluded which the Bolsheviks· took advantage of to carry on agitation among the Cossacks with the result that the latter refused to continue the advance.
On November 14 [1] a delegation from the Soviet High Command arrived in Gatchina and demanded the cessation of military opera­ tions and the surrender of Kerensky.
Kerensky managed to escape, but Krasnov was arrested.

* * The Central Rada of the Ukraine, which consisted of Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and other petty-bourgeois nationalist groups; was· formed ai a· congress of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois national organisations held in Kiev in April 1917.
Soon after the October ·Revolution; the Rada adopted the so-called "Third Edict," which proclaimed the Ukraine to be an Independent People's Republic headed by a Rada and a General Secretariat.
The General Secretariat of the Rada immediately took up a sharply hostile attitude towards the Soviets.
In Kiev, the Rada disarmed the Red Guards,· arrested the most active Soviet workers and began to unite a11 the anti-Bolshevik forces.
It allowed the Cossack forces to pass through Ukrainian territory to join General Kaledin on the Don, and in this way it helped the latter in his struggle against the Soviets.

*** The counter-revolutionary action of that period was that of General Kaledin.
In June 1917 General Kaledin became Ataman of the Don Cossacks.
In November of that year he commenced military operations against the Soviet· government in the Don.
For this purpose he organised the· Cossack troops and relied· on the aid of the "volunteer" forces of General Alexeyev.
Against him were the forces of the Red Guards ~nd Cossa~k troops from the front which had joined them.
The fight agamst Ka:Iedrn lasted until January 1918 and ended in his defeat.
On January 29, 1918, after the defeat of Ka:Iedin, the White Guard Cossack government was dissolved and Kaledin committed suicide.
His assistant, General Bogayevsky (the president of the diss(}lved Cossack government) made an effort to.
continue the struggle, but he too was defeated and on March 4 he ~urren­ dered to the Chief of the SoViet Cossack forces, Golubev.
Together with the iauer, however, he turned against the Soviet government and began.
to prepare for a fresh offensive against the Soviets.
He was soon captured by the Red Guards, however, and on April 14 he was shot.

* The democratisation of the army was started .
with the issu~ -0f the celebrated Order No.
1 issued by the Petrograd Soviet of Workers and Soldiers' Deputies on March 14 [l]; 1917.
In· accordance with this order, committees were formed in all.
units of the army; the army was ation to officers by soldiers when off duty were abolished.
From th.
e point of view of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who were then the leaders of the Soviets, one of the principa-1 aims of this democratisation was to restore the fighting fitness of the army in the imperialist war.
That is why they tried to restrict the democratisation of the army demanded by Order No.
1 within limits that would serve the interests of what they called "defending the revolution," which in fact meant protecting the interests of the bourgeoisie in the imperialist war, and which would not in any way affect the position and rights of the old counter-revolutionary officers and the High Command of the army.
But even this sort of democratisation ran counter to the principles upon which the tsarist army was based, and upon which all capitalist armies are based, and it created favourable soil for revolutionary work in the army.
That is why the bourgeoisie and the officers in the army were hostile to this democratisation, because, in their opinion, it led to the "disintegration" of the army.
As soon as the first signs of Bolshevik influence in the army were observed at the front and in the rear, the Provisional Government adopted measures to restrict the operation of Order No.
1.
This was the purpose of the government's Declaration of Rights of the Soldiers.
But Guchkov, the Minister for War, refused to sanction this declaration on the grounds that it did not sufficiently restrict the "liberty" of the soldier, and it was signed by the subsequent Coalition Government under Kerensky.
Also in the interests of "defending the revolu· tion," i.

, of protecting the interests of the bourgeoisie, the govern­ ment after the July days went to the length of restoring the death penalty at the front.
The object of these measures was to restore the old discipline of the stick in the army.
On the other hand, from the very first, the elected army .
organisations which were formed on the basis of Order No.
1 were packed with Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and repre­ sentatives of the officers; and while the composition of the lower army organisations changed to a more or less ·degree .
in proportion as Bolshevik influence developed in the army and the masses of the soldiers became revolutionary, the higher organisations assumed an increasingly counter­ revolutionary character, and during the October Revolution, as well as im­ mediately after it, they served as strongholds of the counter-revolutionary officers and bases for their operations against the proletarian revolution.
Naturally, such a situation in the army could not be tolerated.
It was im­ possible to dissolve the old army as long as the country was involved in imperialist war and until a· new Red Army had been formed.
Hence, it was necessary to break the resistance of the old counter-revolutionary generalS mul officers and to destroy their strongholds, viz.
, the higher army organi­ sations.
For this purpose a new democratisation of the army, to which Lenin refers in his report, was required.
This was carried out by the decree of the Council of People's Commissars of December 29 [16], 1917, which introduced the principle of election of officers, including the commander: ' .

** The slogan of workers' controf of social production -and ·consumption was one of the most important Bolshevik slogans and had-been formulated in Lenin's famous "April Theses" in 19i7.
Lenfo explained tlie significance of workers' control in particular detail in his pamphlet The Threatening Catastrophe and How To Fight It.
Speaking of the lundainental and principal means of preventing economic catastrophe and-famine, Lenin wrote: "This means is control, supervision, accounting, state regulation, the establishment of a correct distribution of labour forces in the production and distribution of products, husbanding the resources of the people, ·elimination of anr waste of forces, the utmost economy.
Control, supervision, accounting-this· is the first word in the fight against catastrophe and famine.
" (Collected Works, Vol.
XXI.
) Among the most important meas­ ures that were to accompany the introduction of workers' control, Lenin then proposed the following: 1) The nationalisation of the banks 2) The nationalisation of the sugar, coal, oil and metallurgical syndi: cates, 3) The abolition of commercial secrets, 4) The compulsocy amalga­ mation of manufacturers, merchants, etc.
, into syndicates and 5) The compulsory amalgamation of the population ·in consumers' co-operative societies.
Lenin regarded the fundamental condition for.
effective workers' control to be political power in the hOJnds of the proletariat.
Thus, workers' control was one of tl1e slogans of the proletarian revolution and in this revolution it was to serve as.
a transitional measure towards the socialisation of production, towards transferring industry from the hands of the capital­ ists to.
the.
hands.
of the.
proletarian state, and the transformation of private 9apitalist _trade into the state and co-operative organisation '?£ exchange and : distribution, the forms of which were to be determined in the -subsequent progress of the revolution in accordance with the concrete conditions of the class struggle and -of socialist construction.
-Soon after the-October Revolution, on November 27 [14], 1917, the All­ RuEsian Central Executive Committee adopted, and later put into operation, a .
decree on workers' control which was based on Lenin's draft of this decree.
For the text of this draft see Lenin's "Draft Statutes on Work­ .
"rs' Control" in Selected W arks, Vol.
VI and the explanatory notes thereto.
The capitalists expressed -very grea_t hostility to the decree on I: -.
-I the Petrograd ManufactU:rers' Association on December 6 [_November 23], 1917, employers were advised to close their e:qterprises in the event of a demand being -ma_de for the introduction of workers' control.

this committee were given to Soviet organisations.
In the beginning of A_prll an order, signed by Lenin, was sent to all the Soviets urging the necessity of reorganising the local committees for the leather industry in such a way as to give two-thirds of the seats on these committees to the workers and one-third to the employers.

* The strike of October 1905, which was carried out under the slogan of the overthrow of tsarism, began with the Moscow railway strike at the end of September.
Within a few days the strike affected the whole of Moscow, spread to St.
Petersburg and other towns, and developed into a general strike.
All over the country the employees in all industrial enter-prises, the railways, the post and telegraph, etc.
, went on strike.
Offic~als ___ _ in state institutions, doctors, engineers, and lawyers also went on stnke.
The strike ended after the promulgation of the tsar's Manifesto of October 30 [17], 1905, .
which promised liberty and the convocation of a State Duma for "legislative" work on .

* The Seventh Congress of the Party took place on March 6-8, 1918, and was convened for the purpose of discussing a very important question-of international politics, viz.
, Soviet Rus.
sia's withdrawal from the war and the -conclusion of peace with Germany.
The only other question discussed at this congress was the question of the revision of the Party programme.
.
The Second Congress of" Soviets, which was held on the ~or;ow of the victorv of the_ October Revolution, adopted the_ Decr-ee on Pea£e proposed by L~nin (for Lenin's report-on this decree.
see· Selected Works,.
Vol.
VI).
.
This decree contained an appeal to the peoples and _ g-0vernments cof the belligerent countries proposing immediate.
negotiations for :peace.
The Council of People's· Commissars published this de~ree and took all measures to bring about the opening of peace negotiations, The Entente governments ignored the proposal of the Soviet government.
Germany alone agreed to open peace negotiations.
These negotiations began on December 22 [9], 1917, and continued with interruptions until March 3, 1918, when the Brest­ Llt.

Party and almost caused a split.
Lenin, and those who supported the position he outlined in his "Report on War and Peace" at the Seventh Party Congress, \\rere obliged to wage a fierce,struggle in the Party in favour of concluding peace before his point of view prevailed.
The fight against Lenin's position on this question was waged by the so-called "Left" Com­ munists led by N.
Bukharin, who was their political leader, theoretician and inspirer; and they waged this struggle also in the Soviets where they worked hand in hand with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries.
In the Party, the "Left" Communists controlled the Moscow Regional Bureau and the Moscow arid Petrograd Committees of the Party, · and they utilised the apparatus, the forces, and the finances of these organisations for the purpose of waging a furious factional struggle.
On January 10, 1918 [December 28, 1917], the Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party passed a resolution demanding the cessation of peace negotia­ tions with imperialist Germany and also the rupture of all diplomatic re­ lations "with all the diplomatic pirates of all countries.
" At the end of January 1918, both the Moscow and Petrograd Committees protested against the peace negotiations and demanded their cessation.
In opposition to Lenin's view that it was necessary immediately to conclude peace with Germany even on the harshest terms for the sake of preserving the dictator­ ~hip of the proletariat in Soviet Russia as the hearth of the international revolution, of obtaining a "respite" in which to prepare for the further ~truggle for this dictatorship and of fulfilling its internal and international tasks, Lenin's opponents either put forward the demand for an immediate .
revolutionary war or Trotsky's formula: "We otop the war, we do not con­ clude peace, we demobilise the army.
" At a joint conference of the Central Committee and the delegates at the Third All-Russian Coil.
gress of Soviets, 32 delegates voted in favour of a revolutionary war, 16 voted for the Trotskyist position, and 15 voted for Lenin's point of view.
It is true that of all the delegates present only one, Comrade Stukov, voted for an immediate rupture of negotiations.
On January 24 [11] the Central Committee, by a majority of 9 against 7, ad~pted Trotsky's formula.
On the morning of February 18, when it trans­ pired that the Germans were advancing, 6 members of the Central Committee voted in favour of a proposal to send a telegram to the German headquarters agreeing to conclude peace, while 7 voted against.
It was only on the evening of February 18 that Lenin's point of view prevailed: 7 voted in favour of sending the telegram, 5 voted against, and 1 abstained.
On February 23 the Central Committee discussed the new proposals of the German government.
Lenin, Stalin, Zinoviev, Stassova, Sverdlov, Sokolnikov and Smilga were in favour of accepting them, while Bubnov, Uritsky, Bukharin and Lomov were opposed.
Trotsky, Krestinsky, Dzerzhinsky and Joffe abstained from voting.
Thus, by a relative majority of 7 against 4, with 4 abstaining, a decision was adopted to resume negotiations with Germany on the basis of the latter's new proposals.
This decision of the Central Committee did not help to abate the differences.
The "Lefts" with all their energy and persistence pursued a policy of disrupting this decision.
The Moscow Regional Bureau of t~e Party, at its meeting on February 24, expressed "its lack of confidence m the Central Committee in view of its political line and composition" and declared that "it will at the first opportunity insist on the election of a new Central Committee.
" The resolution of the Bureau concluded with the state­ ment that "it was of the opinion that a split in the Party was .
hardly to be avoided in the near future.
" The "Left" members of the Central Committee, at the meeting of the latter held on February 23, declared that the~ "re­ signed from all responsible Soviet and Party posts and reserved the liberty to carry on agitation within the Party and outside of it.
" But even before the Seventh Congress of the Party (March 1918) a number of organisations which had formerly supported the proposal of the "Lefts'.
' expressed themselves in favour of the line of the Central Committee.
On March 3 the Soviet delegation in Brest-Litovsk signed the peace treaty and on March 4 the Moscow City Conference of the Party, by a vote of 64 against 52, adopted a resolution supporting the signing of ~he Br~st Peace Treaty passed a vote of confidence in the Central Committee, mstructed its del~gates to the Seventh Congress to support Party unity.
a~d condem~ed the attempt of the "Lefts" to cause a split.
On March 7 a s1m1lar resolutron was adopted by the Petrograd Party Conierence and by a number of Petro-grad District Party Conferences.

Lenin's report on war and peace at the Seventh Party Congress ;'~s decisive.
By an overwhelming majority the Party CoI.
J.
gress adopted Lenm s point of view, and shortly after, the Fourth Extraordinary Congress of Soviets, also on the report of Lenin, ratified the peace treaty.
But even after th:se two congr·esses, right up to the summer of 1918, the "Left" Commun~sts continued their policy of opposing the Leninist Party line, not only on th.
e question of peace, but also on a number of fundamental questions of sociali:t construction.
(See article: "'Left-Wing' Childishness and Petty-Bourge01s Mentality" and note to p.
351* in this volume.
) And in this also Bukharin acted as their leader and theoretician.
In this new period of the struggle against the Party the "Left" -Commun­ ists again entered into a bloc with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in the Soviets and thus more than ever corroborated the class characterisation which Lenin gave of them as those expressing the strivings and waverings of the petty bourgeois driven to a frenzy by the horrors of war.
The acuteness and protracted nature of the "Lefts' " differences with the Party are to be explained by the fact that the "Lefts," like typi~al "frenzie~" petty bourgeois, took as their starting point the petty-bourge01s opportumst appraisal of the important problems of the proletarian· revolution.
.
, .
.
Notwithstanding their verbal revolutionariness, the "Lefts" adopted the the question of building socialism in a single country.
They were of the opinion that .
it was impossible for Soviet Russia to build socialism with its own forces un­ aided by the victorious· proletariat of the West.
For example, Ossinsky wrote: "Only the intervention of international Socialism, only the assistance of the workers who are at a higher stage of development, can create an absolute revival of Russian economy.
· There is ·no other way out, and only by trans­ .
forming .
.
.
the civil war into a world civil war can we achieve the respite that we need.
" These pronouncements by the "Lefts" were in fact simply a repetition of those of Trotsky, who, fully in accordance with his theory of .
permanent revolution declared at the Seventh Party Congress: "A certain disparity has beco~e revealed, the roots of which lie very deep: the backwardness of our country: .
.
.
It [the revolution.
-Ed.
], at the very first stage of it~ development, has not obtained the necessary support.
.
.
.
O~ly a European revolution can save us in the full sense of the word.
" Bukharin said that the socialist revolution could "either come.
to a stand­ still or spread out, because it is not developing in a corked bottle.
" In opposition to the Party line and in complete agreement with Trotsky­ ism, the "Left" Communists asserted that the socialist revolution in Soviet Russia could develop only in the event of a victory of the proletariat in the West, that only this victory could create the possibilities of socialist con­ struction in Soviet Russia and that in the event of .
the world revolution being ·delayed, Soviet.
Russia was doomed.
· Regarding the effort to obtain a respite as a departure from the funda­ mental principles of internationalism, the "Lefts" were totally incapable of understanding the relation between the Russian revolution and the world revolution.
In their d"eclaration to the Central Committee they wrote that agreei,ng to peace "pushes the Russian revolution out of the course of the international movement.
" They were of the opinion that the only way in which international obligations could be fulfilled was by an immediate ,)ffensive against the world bourgeoisie.
Jointly with the Trotskyists, and .
in opposition to Lenin and the Party, they denied the enormous importance for the development of the world revolution of preserving the proletarian dfotatorship in· Soviet Russia by concluding peace with Germany and thus obtaining a respite.
Having slipped into this nationally restricted conception of the role and significance of the proletarian revolution and of the prole­ tarian dictatorship in Sovi~t Russia, the Moscow "Lefts" were prepared to take the risk of having the Soviet power destroyed by the bayonets of German imperialism; for in their opinion peace with German imperialism was a shameful bargain with the imperialists which deprived the Soviet power of all revolutionary significance, made it "purely formal" and there­ fore superfluous.
This is exactly what the Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party, in a memorandum acco!Ilifanying the vote of no confidence in the Central Committee referred to above, wrote: "In the interests of the inter: The "Left" Communists recognised only one method of action toward the imperialists, viz.
, direct attack; they refused to take.
into account the forces of the proletarian revolution.
They did not understand that " ••.
only expedient resistance to reaction serves the revolution.
" (Lenin.
) The "Lefts" denied that it was permissible for the proletariat to enter into compromises and to manreuvre.
In opposition to Lenin and the Party, they failed to under~ stand that there are compromises and "compromises," that it is possible and necessary to make great sacrifices in territory ·and material if the task of preserving the base of the world revolution, i.
e.
, the Land of the Soviets, demands it; and they failed to understand that to rush into a fight without having forces means aiding the imperialists who are interested in smashing the dictatorship of the proletariat.
In essence, the position Trot>ky took up on the question of signing.
the Brest Peace did not differ in any way from that of the "Left" Commumsts.
In essence his adventurist formula "We stop the war, but we do not con­ clude peac~" was also a "Left" repudiation of peace on the grounds that it meant compromising with the imperialists.
Moreover, even when at last voting in favour of accepting the German peace terms he said that if the Germans demanded the surrender of the Ukraine it would be.
necessary.
to declare a revolutionary war against them.
Like the .
"Left" Communists, Tiotsky denied that it was possible to agree to any sacrifice, however severe, in order to preserve the proletarian dictatorship.
.
In effect both the "Left" Communists and Trotsky expressed the.
same Menshevik ~oint of view on the question of the character and perspectives of the Russian revolution.
Under the cloak of extreme "revolutionary" phraseology they tried to impose upon the Party a policy that could only have led to the doom of the proletarian dictatorship.

soldiers took place in Petrograd and Moscow to protest against the note sent to the Allied governments by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Milyukov, in which ·he informed the Allied governments that the Provisional Government adhered to the treaties concerning the objects of the war concluded by the tsarist government with Great Britain and France.

*** The July events were the events of July 16-18 [July 3-5 old style], 1917, when in connection with the temporary resignation of the Constitutional-"Ali Power to the So~iets," and called upon the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets to take political power.
For two days armed mass demonstra­ tions took place in Petrograd.
The demonstrations wei;e of a peaceful character, but the Provisional Government called out troops which fired on the demonstrators, and this led to armed conflicts.
On the evening of July 18, counter-revolutionary military units arrived in Petrograd from the front and suppressed the movement.
House to house searches were made, many Bolsheviks were arrested, and the editorial and printing offices of Pravda were wrecked.
The July days were followed by a period of the actual counter-revolutionary dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
This dictatorship was exercised through the medium of the military clique operating under the protection of the Kerensky government and "the leaders of the Soviets and of the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties headed by Tseretelli and Chernov," who, as Lenin said at the time, "had definitely betrayed the cause of the revolution by placing it in the hands of the counter-revolution­ aries and transforming themselves, their parties and the Soviets into fig.
leaves for the counter-revolution.
" (Collected Works, Vol.
XXI, "The Political Situation.
") The July days marked the turning point in the revolution; they marked the end of the dual power and of the "peaceful" period of the revolution.
From that moment the immediate task became to prepare the Party, the workers and the masses of the soldiers for the violent seizure of power by the proletariat, for the armed uprising.
In this connection the treachery of the Soviets, which were then led by the Iv[ensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, their transformation into "fig-leaves" of the bour­ geois counter-revolution, led to the Bolsheviks temporarily withdrawing the slogan "All Power to the Soviets" until the Bolshevik Party had won the Soviets and transformed them into organs of the struggle for the power of the proletariat, into organs of insurrection.
For Lenin's appraisal of the July events and the political situation that arose after them, see the article "On Slogans" in Selected Works, Vol.

* By-the Kornilov affair is meant the attempt to bring about a bourgeois counter-revolution for the purpose of establishing the military dictatorship of General Kornilov.
The plot to bring about this counter­ revolution was organised by the tsarist generals led by Kornilov; at that time Commander-in-Chief of the forces, the Constitutional-Democratic Party, and the upper stratum of the commercial and industrial bourgeoisie.
The plot failed owing to the fact that the Bolshevik Party succeeded in widely mobilising against it the masses of the workers and soldiers, which, in turn, caused the compromising petty bourgeoisie, led by Kerensky, to waver.
The military units which Kornilov withdrew from the front in order to attack Petrograd (the Cossack Corps and the so-called Savage Division) never reached Petrograd; they became demoraiised on the way.
Under the pressure of the and arrest him (soon after Kornilov escaped).

* * This refers to the July offensive on the Russian Western and Southwestern front undertaken by the Coalition Provisional Government in July 1917 in the effort to bring the imperialist war to a victorious conclusion.
In this they received the unreserved support of the Mensheviks and Socialist­ Revolutionaries who were represented in the government.
Kerensky made a special tour of the front and at meetings of the soldiers tried.
to persuade them to take up the offensive.
The offensive was started on July 1.
The first days of the offensive were successful, but then followed a disastrous retreat; the army suffered enormous_ losses in killed, wounded and prisoners.
This "offensive," and its results, gave a tremendous impetus to the rapid revolu­ tionisation of the masses at the front and in the rear, and particularly to the July demonstrations in Petrograd referred to in note to p.

* Trotsky did not sign the peace treaty on February 10, 1918, !mt announced that the Soviet government was withdrawing from the war and declared the state of war with Germany at an end.
In this he was prompted by the utterly adventurist position he took up that the Germans could not attack.
Nevertheless, on February 18, the German army took the-~~­ offensive, which continued until March 2.
During that period the German troops, without encountering·any resistance, occupied Dvinsk, Minsk, Polotsk, Rezhitza, Orsha, Wolmar, Wenden, Hopsal, Pskov, Dorpat, Reval, Borissov and Narva.
They occupied the towns and railway stations with small units of 60, 100 and 200 men.
They captured a large quantity of provisions, equipment, shells, artillery, etc.
After this offensive the German imperialists dictated peace conditions that were far more harsh than those they had offered before.

* On June 16 [3], 1907, the tsarist government, headed by the Prime Minister, Stolypin, dispersed the Second State Duma, arrested and tried the Social-Democratic members of the Duma, and issued a new electoral law which greatly reduced the rate of representation of the working class and the peasants, which was very restricted even under the preceding electoral law.
The dispersion of the Second Duma marked a further stage in the government's determined attack upon all the gains of the Revolution of 1905-1907, and it was accompanied by unprecedented terror against all the Party, trade union and educational organisations of the working class.
Lenin, recognising the temporary defeat of the revolution, insisted upon a change in the methods of the struggle against tsarism for the purpose of preparing.
for a fresh revival of the revolution.
In opposition to the "Lefts" (the otzov­ ists, ultimatumists and V peryod-ists; see note to p.

* This refers to the Fourth Extraordinary Congtess of Soviets which wa~ to have opened in Moscow on -March 12, 1918, but which opened on March 14 and lasted until March 16.
There were present" alfogether 1,172 delegates with decisive votes and 80 delegates with consultative votes.
Of these; 814 were Bolsheviks, 238 Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, 14 Anarchists, 24· Men· sheviks, 16 Internationalist-Social-Demo_crats, 24 -Maximalists and 15 Right Socialist-Revolutionaries.
The congress -discussed only two questions: l) the ratification of the Brest-Litovs~ Peace and 2) the transfer of the capital to Moscow.
Peace was ratified on March· 15.
by 784 votes against 261, and ll5 abstaining.
Among the latter were ·the "Left" Communists:.

In this the emigre Russian bourgeoisie tried to play oh patriotic sentiments, and they set uj:J a howl about the Bolsheviks betraying and selling Russia to the Ger­ mans.
The petty-bourgeois parties such as the Dyelo Naroda-ists (i.
e.
, the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries who published a new_spaper called Dyelo Naroda-The People's Cause), the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Right Mensheviks and the "Left" variety of M,enshevism known as the N ova:ya Zhizn-ists, from the newspaper which they published, Novaya Zh_izn (New Life), and who called themselves Internationalist-Social-Democrats, all echoed the protests of the emigre bourgeoisie.
The "Left" Communists, in fighting against the Party on the question of peace, and themselves expressing the vacillations of the "frenzied" petty bourgeois, dropped into the arguments of the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties.
Lenin repeatedly pointed to the solidarity between the "Left" Communists and the petty-bourgeois and bour­ geois parties.
}[e wrote: "In their theses" (i.
e.
, the theses of the "Left" Com­ munists) "as well as in the theses of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, we see, primarily, the same thing that we see in the camp of the Rights, in the camp of the bourgeoisie, from Milyukov to Martov.

* The article; "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," was written in March-April 1918 and published in lzvestiya of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, No.
85, on April 28, 1918.
In it Lenin develops the plan of socialist construction which in Russian Soviet literature is known as "Lenin's economic j:Jlan of the spring of 1918.
" It is from this point of view that all the tasks which Lenin outlines in this article are "immediate," i.
e.
, tasks that logically follow from the specific features of the situation which Lenin indicates in his article, and particularly from the "precarious" respite obtained as a result of the Brest-Litovsk Peace.
In drawing up his economic plan Lenin set the task of utilising this respite for the purpose of marching further forward towards creating the necessary prerequisites for the transi­ tion to socialism, viz.
, the organisation of the administration of the country and its economy, the organisation of production and distribution, national accounting and control of production and distribution, the development of self-discipline and socialist competition among the toilers, the combination of proletarian Soviet democracy with individual management in industry, the utilisation of bourgeois specialists and capitalists in the organisation of production and distribution, etc.
He gave the reasons for and expressed these tasks in very concrete forms on the basis of a strict calculation of the peculiar features of Russia at that time and of the specific situation then prevailing, and on the basis of a Marxian application to these conditions of the teachings of scientific communism concerning the transitional period and paths to socialism.
In this respect, all the pcilnts that he deals with in this article are directly linked up with the tasks indicated at the Third Congre.
ss of Soviets (see Lenin's "Report to the Third All-Russian Congress of Soviets, January 24 [11], 1918 [The Activities of the Council of People's Commissars]'~ in.
this volume, in which, as in the present article, he points to the orgamsatwnal task of the revolution as one which had already come up on the order of the day).
The saine tasks are indicated at the Fourth Congress of So:iet~ at which in a resolutio,n on the Brest-Litovsk Peace proposed by Lenm ,see note t~ p.
313* '''), the organisational tasks of the revolution are very ~trongly and persistently emphas!sed.
Lenin's reports and proposals at the Thir_d and Fourth Congresses of Soviets link up his "economic plan of the sprmg of 1918" with the plan of transitional measures, with the programme of the proletarian revolution in Russia, which Lenin outlined even before the Oc­ tober Revolution (see "The Tasks of the Proletariat in the Present Revolu­ tion" "The Tasks of the Proletariat in Our Revolution," "The Aims of the Rev~lution" and "Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?" in Selected W arks, Vol.
VI), and which began to be put into operation in the revolu_tionary measures of the October Revolution and immediately afterwards.
It rs suffi­ cient to recall the fact that even in 1917 Lenin placed the organisation of -accounting and control of production and distribution (i.
e.
, the very point which lay at ·the basis of his "economic plan of the spring of 1918") .
at.
the basis of the programme of the revolution as a transitional measu:~ to sociali7m, as a measure which was to lead to the creation of the prereqmsrtes of social­ ism.
The difference was that in 1918 the organisation of accounting and control of production and distribution was presented in a number of new concrete forms corresponding to the conditions prevailing in the spring of that year.
It would be quite wrong, however, to regard the article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" merely from the point of view of the tasks dictated by the application of the programme of the proletarian revolutio~ to the conditions prevailing in the spring of 1918.
In 1921, when the trans1· tion from War Communism to the New Economic Policy, or N.
E.
P.
, as it was generally known, was taking place, Lenin more than once _emphasis~d the fact that, in effect, the New Economic Policy was the old policy; and m doing so he referred to the policy he had proposed in the spring of 1~18 in this article and in the resolution adopted on his report by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on April 29, 1918.
He did not .
mean by this, of course that the New Economic Policy was literally the same as the policy outlined 'in this and other of his articles and speeches in defence of his proposals.
It could not be literally the same because the conditions i~ 1921 differed in many respects from the conditions in the spring of 1918, rf only for the reason that between 1918 and 1921 lies the period of War Commun· ism, which resulted in a number of achievements in socialist construction, in a number of class changes (for example, the raising of large masses of the poor peasantry to the position of middle peasants), in an immeasurably g~eater amount of economic ruin, and in the interruption of economic re­ lations between town and country.
In essence, however, the policies were 32* --------class struggle against the bourgeoisie of the transitional :Period and against the petty-bourgeois element runs equally through Lenin's S:Peeches and articles on the New Economic Policy in 191!1 and his speeches and articles on economic policy in ihe s:Pring of 1918.
This is particularly the case in the present article and in " 'Left-Wing' Childishness and Petty­ Bourgeois Mentality," also in this volume.
Both in the spring of 1918 and in the spring of 1921 there is the same emphasis on the struggle against the petty-bourgeois element as the "principal enemy" in the given period; there is the same denial of the possibility at the given moment of a direct transition to socialism, and emphasis is laid on the need for a number of transitional measures and means of economic construction, particularly state capita/,ism under the proletarian state as a weapon in the struggle against the bourgeoisie and against the petty-bourgeois element, and as a higher form of economy compared with non-state-regulated private capital­ ism and with small production.
Lenin does not employ the term "state capitalism" in this article, but the "national accounting and control" of capitalist industry, to which he refers, is precisely state capitalism.
In his "Report on the Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" at the April session of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (Collected Works, Vol.
XXII), and in his article "'Left-Wing' Childishness and Petty-Bourgeois Mentality," in this volume, he employs the term "state capitalism" in defending his economic :Plan against the "Left", Socialist-Revolutionaries and "Left" Communists.
A number of the fundamental points of the economic policy of the spring of 1918 and of the first stages of the New Economic Policy are undoubtedly similar.
It is therefore not surprising that in presenting his arguments in favour of the New Economic Policy in his pamphlet The Food Tax (Selected Works, Vol.
IX), he reproduces a considerable part of his article " 'Left-Wing' Childishness and Petty-Bourgeois Mentality," and this is precisely the part in which, in fighting against "Left" Communism, he gives the theoretical grounds for the economic policy of the spring of 191S.
It goes without saying, however, that the concrete forms of the measures proposed in the spring of 1918 differed from those of the spring of 1921.
For example, the policy of state capitalism under the proletarian state which was pursued in the spring of 1918 in relation to the capitalist enterprises not yet nationalised assumes the form of concessions in 1921 (see Lenin's "Speech Delivered at a Meeting of Nuclei Secretaries of the Moscow Organisation of the R.
C.
P.
, November 26, 1920," in Selected Works, Vol.
VIII) and the leasing to capitalists of enterprises in the now entirely national­ ised industries.
Hence, in this respect, state capitalism under the proletarian state assumed new forms.
In the spring of 1918, the national accounting and control of the distribution of products was carried out by establishing control .
over the co-operative societies, whi.
Q.
h were then entirely bourgeois and packed with Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.
In 1921, however; it was In 1921 the Soviet government itself re-organised the co-operative societies on a: voluntary basis, but in the conditions that prevailed in the first stages of the New Economi.
c Policy they inevitably contained ("chemically produced") capitalist as well as Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary elements.
How­ ever, accounting and control in 1918 and the state regulation of the activities of the co-operative societies (state co-operative capitalism, as Lenin called it then) in 1921 pursued the same aim according to Lenin's plan, viz.
, the organisation of the whole of the population in co-operative societies which, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and with the land and the means of production in the hands of the proletarian state, is already socialism.
Lenin laid equal emphasis on this in 1918, 1921 and 1923.
.
These examples are sufficient to show what was common to the New Economic Policy of 1921 and the policy of.
the spring of 1918, which Lenin outlined in this article, and what connects the two.
But it is riot sufficient to point to.
what is common to both in order to understand ~he e.
normous significance of this article.
If the reader peruses it at all carefully he will readily see that a number of fundamental propositions developed in it are being applied by the Party and the Soviet government at the present stage of socialist construction in the U.
S.
S.
R.
, i.
e.
, in the period when the foundations of socialist economy .
have already been laid, when the country has "entered the period of socialism," when, from the period of transitional stages ~osocial­ ism it has, on a number of sectors of construction (particularly .
in the rural districts, where the.
victory of collective farming has been .
achieved), _passed to the "period of directly expanded socialist construction along the whole_ front.
" (Stalin.
) It is precisely in this period that "national accounting and control of production and distribution" assumes a new and most· striking form.
It assumes the form of planned construction of socialism carried out by the masses themselves under the leadership of the Party and its local organi­ sations in the factories; the plan of construction is brought to the knowledge of even the smallest industrial unit (to the.
workers at each machine in the factory, to every single worker.
in the Soviet farms and farmer in the collective farms).
It is precisely in this period that the necessity, which Lenin emphasis~i in this article, of fighting to raise the productivity of labour acquires.
special importance.
This fight to raise the productivity of labour is expressed in the Party slogan, which has been adopted by the vast masses of the·workers; of mastering modern techniqrie'and of ruthlessly fighting against loitering and for stern labour discipline alorig the whole front of socialist constructicm, .
One· ef the greatest implements for raising the productivity oflabciur and for stimulat­ ing the fulfilment of the plans of the Party and of the Soviet government along the ~whole front, in town and countey, in the factories, in the Soviet farms· and collective farms.
is the fulfilment of Lenin's behest regarding socialist· com­ &>etitioll.
, Sc.
cialist competition has -de¥e:l.
9;ped on .
an enormou~ scale in the government.
In this socialist competition and particularly in its higher form, shock brigade work, is expressed the "activity and self-sacrifice, the enthusiasm and initiative of the vast masses of the workers and collective farmers" (Stalin) and the "colossal energy developed by them in conjunction with the engineering and technical forces" without which it would have been impossible to achieve the results of the First Five-Year Plan and to carry out the tasks of the Second Five-Year Plan.
At · the same time this socialist competition and shock brigade work was one of the highest manifestations of the development of proletarian democracy.
It is precisely at the present time that broad proletarian democracy, i.
e.
, the enlistment of the broad masses of the workers and peasants (primarily those in collective farms) in the work of administering the state and of manag­ ing industry, combined with individual management and individual res­ ponsibility in management, has produced such splendid results as the achievements of the First Five-Year Plan and of the first years of the Second 'Five-Year Plan.
Lenin outlined his "economic plan of the spring of 1918" in his article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" in the light of the principles of the socialist reconstruction of society, and these principles are finding increasingly striking expression in real life in proportion as the Soviet Union is approaching the complete state of class­ less socialist society.
And it is precisely for this reason that the fundamental ideas contained in "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" are applied in real life on such a wide scale and in such a forceful and striking manner at the present stage of socialist construction in the Soviet Union.
Such is the historical, theoreticat and modern practical significance of Lenin's "Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government.
" Actually, this work was Lenin's written report for the session of the All­ Russian Central Executive Committee held in April 1918.
At this session he proposed that his report be taken as read, and he devoted his speech to replying to the criticism that was levelled against the fundamental pro­ positions in that report by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and "Left" Communists.
In the course of this speech he devoted particular attention to.
the "Left" Communists who at that time, in spite of their defeat on the question of the Brest-Litovsk Peace, had not yet by far laid down their arms in their factional struggle against Lenin's leadership and the Leninist line of the Party (see note to p.
351 *).
In spite of the resistance of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and of the "Left" Communists, the Leninist line was victorious also on the questions of socialist construction.
In parti­ cular, at its meeting of April 29, 1918, the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, after hearing Lenin's report, adopted his "Theses on the Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government," which contained all the main points of the article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Governmenf' just on the ratification of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty.
The part of the resolution to which Lenin refers reads as follows: "The congress most urgently submits to all workers, soldiers and peasants, to all the toilers and oppressed masses, the most im­ portant, immediate and necessary task of the present moment, viz .
• to in­ crease the activity and self-discipline of the toilers, to create everywhere strong and symmetrical organisations embracing as far as possible the whole of the production and distribution of products, to ruthlessly combat the_ chaos, disorganisation and ruin which were the historically inevitable heritage of the torturous war, but which at the same time are a prim¥Y obstacle to the cause of the final victory of socialism and the consolidation of the foundations of socialist society.
" .

* By saying "at the present moment" (March-April 1918) "we are approximately at the level reached in 1793 and 1871" Lenin meant, on the one hand, the level reached by the Paris Commune in 1871 in regard to breaking up the state machine of the bourgeoisie, the establishment of the first dictatorship of the proletariat ever to be set up, and the creation of the first model of a state of a new proletarian type.
On the other hand, he meant the level reached by the revolutionary di<;tatorship of the petty bourgeoisie represented by the J acobins during the French_ Re­ volution of 1789-93 in regard to the destruction of the remnants of feudal, ism.
Lenin makes this twofold comparison because the October socialist revolution in Soviet Russia, in establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, in breaking the state machine of the bourgeoisie and develop_ing the socialist transformation of the whole national economy, at the same time, "by the way, in passing," fulfilled the hitherto unfulfilled tasks of the bourgeois­ democratic revolution, among these being the abolition of the remnants of serfdom.
PAGE 322.
* Lenin here refers to the decree of the Paris Commune of April 2, 1871, which read as follows: "Whereas, high public positions, owing to their being hitherto highly paid positions, have been the object of universal aspiration and were granted as posts of honour; "Whereas, in a real democratic republic there can be no sinecures or extremely high salaries; "The Paris Commune decrees: "That the salaries of the public officials of the Commune shall not ex, ceed 6,000 francs per annum.
" Following Marx, Lenin attached great importance t_o this decree.
because it was one of the practical manifestations of the "breaking up of the sta,te .
apparatus of the bourgeoisie'' .
and of the creation of a new proletarian,_ S~l!-~e·: operative societies and to workers' co-operative societies which retained the bourgeois point of view: their representatiyes were actually given the right to vote on the issuing of the Decree; membership of the co-operative societies on a voluntary basis and the payment of membership dues was preserved; "working class" co-operative societies which, in fact, retained the bourgeois point of view were preserved; the proposal of the Soviet government to expel the bourgeoisie from the management bodies of the co-operative societies was applied only to owners of private capitalist com, mercial and industrial enterprises, and even then with certain modifications in regard to those "who, after ceasing their trading activities, revealed them­ selves as useful co-operators.
" In the ~eriod of the Civil War which followed after the Brest respite, the concessions made to the co-operative societies in April 1918 were gradually withdrawn.
On March 20, 1919, a decree was issued making it compulsory for the whole of the population to join co-operative societies without the payment of membership dues, and ordering the creation of a single All-Russian consumers' co-operative society with a single centre of management.
At the end of 1919 the opinion recorded in the decisions of the Party adopted on June 18 and October 17, 1919, that it was necessary to create a single centralised consumers' co-operative apparatus and to secure a Communist majority in it, received universal recognition and be­ came predominant in the Russian Communist P<1rty.
However it was found im~os~ible to capture the central and loca,l apparatus of the co-operative societies, and the Party had once again to raise the question of the CO· operative societies at the Ninth Party Congress in 1920.

* ~enin refers to the Statutes on Labour Discipline drawn up by the All-Russian Central Council of Trade Unions.
In these Statutes it is declared that one of the main causes of the decline in the productivity of labour was "the absence of all industrial discipline.
" The Statutes indicated a.
~u~ber of practical measures for the purpose of improving labour disciph~e; such as: the introduction of a card system for registering the productivity of each worker; the introduction of factory regulations in every en~erprise~ the establishment of rate of output bureaux for the purpose of ~ng the rate of output of each worker, and the payment of bonuses for mcreased productivity.

* This refers to the decree issued by the Council of People's C~mm1ssars on.
the centralisation of railway management, the protection of railroads an.
d mcreasing their carrying capacity, published in Izvestiya of ~he All-Russian :entral Executive Committee on March 26, 1918.
It was called ~0rth by the senous state ,pf the ti;anspo,rt system which threatened t-0 bring J about the collapse of the already severely shaken economy of the country.
At that time the Commissariat of Ways of Communication had at its disposal about 650,000 cars and 20,000 locomotives.
Even at the end of 1917 the number of locomotives and cars out of repair ·had reached the enormous figure of 30 per cent of the total; and the rapid increase in the per cent of locomotives out of repair was particularly marked.
For instance, at the beginning of 1916 the number of locomotives out of repair was 16.
8 per cent of the total, whereas at the beginning of 1917 it was 16.
5 per cent, in April 1917, 17.
2 per cent, and by April 1, 1918, it reached 38.
5 per cent.
Stocks of fuel catastrophically declined.
In 1916 these stocks amounted to 50,000,000 poods (60 poods equal one ton).
On January 1, 1918, they amounted to 9,000,000 poods and on April 1, 1918, to 5,400,000 poods.
As a result of all this the carrying capacity of the railways rapidly declined.
The introduction of iron labour discipline was an absolutely necessary prerequisite for the improvement of the condition of the transport system.
It was for the purpose of creating this discipline that the decree on the reorganisation of the management of the railways was issued.
The main point of this decree was the introduction of individual management and the strict centralisation of the management of transport.
The following are several points of the decree: " .
.
.
5.
No federal, regional or other local Soviet organisation h(ls the right to interfere in transport affairs in view of the fact that although the railways pass through definite territories, they are .
by their very nature extra-territorial, for they serve .
the needs of the whole republic.
All federal, regional and other local Soviet organisations must render every assistance to the railway workers, including armed assistance in the.
event of· any attempt on the part of any organisations to refuse to.
submit to the present decree.
" .
.
.
6.
Every local, district or regional railway centre· shall elect from its midst a worker who is most active and loyal to the Soviet government and has a knowledge of railway affairs, who shall be placed at the head of its centre in the capacity of administrative-technical exec­ utive responsible to the People's Commissar of Ways of Communication.
This person shall be the embodiment of the whole of the dictatorial power of the proletariat in the given railway centre.
"The appointment of such a person shall be endorsed by the People's Commissar of Ways of Communication .
.
•• •• This decree on the management of the railways was severely criticised by the petty-bourgeois parties as well as by the "Left" .
Communists.
The main point that united these opponents was their petty-bourgeois attitude towards labour discipline and individual management.
·Jn particular, the "Left" .
C.
omnmni:its failed to .
understand the importance of either of these in· the struggle against economic ruin and for socialist construction, and they regarded this decree as a reversion from the "commune state" to bureaucratic administ;ratio».
Jn their.
"The.
se~ _on the Ptese»t Situation" ably develop in the direction of bureaucratic centralism, the domination of various commissars, depriving the local Soviets of independence and the actual abandonment of the 'commune state,' i.
e.
, the type of administration from below.
Numerous facts go to show that there are already definite tendencies in this direction (the decree on the administration of the rail­ ways, the articles by Latsis, etc.
).
" In this and similar pronouncements, the "Left" Communists were the expression of the petty-bourgeois element, the struggle against which was one of the most important tasks of the time.
PAGE 351.
* The article "'Left-Wing' Childishness and Petty-Bourgeois Mentality" was written in the beginning of May .
1918 and published in Pravda, Nos.
88-90 of May 9-11, 1918.
It rounds off a series of written and verbal pronouncements by Lenin against the "Left:' Communists headed by Bukharin, who at that time represented a separate factional group within the Party.
Starting their struggle against Lenin's leadershio and the Lenin­ ist line of the Party on the question of the Brest-Litovsk P~ace (see note to p.
283*), they began to act a:s a definite factional group after the acceptance by the Central Committee on February 23, 1918, of the ultimatum of the German government.
At the next session of the Central Committee on February 24, the prominent "Left" Communists handed in a statemen~ to the effect that they resigned from "responsible Party and Soviet posts.
" At first they postponed their actual resignation until the Seventh Congress of the Party, but they resigned on March 3, immediately after the Soviet delegation signed the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty.
On 'February 24, the Mos­ cow Regional Bureau of the Party, which was then in the hands of the "Left" Communists, adopted the resolution mentioned in note-to p.
283, * expressing no confidence in the Central Committee and refusing to submit to its decision of February 23 concerning the acceptance of the German peace terms.
In a memorandum accompanying this resolution they threatened to split the Party.
Taking advantage of the leading position they held on the Moscow Regional Bureau of the R.
C.
P.
, the "Left" Communists published their own factional organ, Kommunist, in the name of the Bureau.
The first issue appeared on April 20, 1918.
At the Seventh Congress of the Party and at the Fourth, Extraordinary Congress of Soviets, which ratified the Brest-Litovsk Peace, the "Left" Communists came out as a definitely organised faction, and notwithstanding th_e direct instructions of the Cen­ tral Committee to the contrary, they made their own "declaration of the group of_ Communists (Bolsheviks) who are opposed to the conclusion of peace.
" After the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty was definitely signed and ratified by the Fourth Congress of Soviets, the "Left" Communists still further intensified their factional struggle.
The Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party was actually transformed into their factional centre.
It issued instructions to the local groups of "Left" Communists, it called conferences of "Lefts" (two such conferences areknown to have taken place, one in th~-;'Left" Communists opposed Lenin's economic policy as outlined in his article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" (in this volume) and in his Theses, which were adopted by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on April 29, 1918.
As against Lenin's line they advanced their own "Theses on the Present Situation," to which Lenin refers at the beginning of this article.
Just as they did during their struggle against the conclusion of the Brest-Litovsk Peace, the "Left" Communists in these Theses accused the Leninist line of the Central Committee of the Party and the enormous majority of the members of the Party of being Right opportunist .
.
Having, willy-nilly, to reconcile themselves to the fact that peace had been signed, they argued that "the rnaj "rity of the soldiers' and peasants' organisations" accepted the peace because the latter consisted of repre• sentatives of the "backward masses of declassed soldiers" and also of the "declassed strata of the proletariat" and the "emaciated" (owing to the war, the failure of the harvest, the food difficulties, and the dislocation of indus, try) sections of the peasantry.
Thus, they regarded the line of Lenin, of the Central Committee and of the Party as a whole on the question of the Brest· Litovsk Peace as nothing more nor less than an expression of opportunism, of .
dragging at the tail of the weary and demoralised strata of the prole­ tariat and peasantry.
Regarding the results of the conclusion of peace with German imperialism as extremely fatal and as having a demoralising effect upon the international revolutionary movement and on the internal situation in the country, the "Left" Communists in their Theses speak of the "diminution of class activity and the increased declassing of the proletariat"; and they go to the length of saying that "in connection with the growing class rapprochement between the proletariat and the poor peasantry (who, after peace was signed under pressure o·f their demands and influence, must be;come the bulwark of the Soviet power), the tendency to divert the major­ ity of the Communist Party, and the Soviet power guided by it, into the ch(Cflnels of petty-bourgeois policy of a new type becomes quite possible.
" (Thesis 9, our italics.
) Thus, from the point of view of the "Left" Commun­ ists, the "rapprochement between the proletariat and the poor peasantry," the transformation of the poor peasants into a "bulwark of the Soviet power," i.

, what for Bolshevism had long been one of the fundamental slogans of the proletarian revolution ("joining with the rural poor" and "relying on them") threatened to divert the majority of the Party "into the channels of petty-bourgeois policy," into the channels of Right opportunism.
In their opinion, the Right deviation was already manifested in the sphere of inter­ nal politics in the verf methods of creating the extremely necessary condi, tions for the transition to socialism which Lenin outlined in his "Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" (although in their Theses they ·do -not Bay a word about Lenin) ~nd :particularly in those forms of state capitalism in the introduction of individual management in industry, and even in "in­ stilling discipline under the guise of 'self-discipline.
' " (Thesis 11.
) They declared that "the path, taken as a whole, a~ well as the tendency to deviate to this path, are extremely dangerous" because they lead to "petty-bourgeois conditions" and hence, in the final analysis, to the restoration of capitalism.
(Thesis 12.
) This false appraisal of the Leninist line of policy of the Party as well as the position the "Left" Communists occupied in the period of the Brest-Litovsk Peace (see note to p.
283*), followed logically from the view they held, in common with Trotsky, that socialism cquld not be built in a sin­ gle country and that without an immediate victory of the proletarian revolu­ tion in other countries a reversion to capitalism was inevitable.
In the conclu­ sion of their Theses they onceagain, as in the period of their struggle against the Brest-Litovsk Peace, threatened to split the Party.
In Thesis 15 they wrote: "The proletarian Communists" (this is what the "Lefts" called them­ selves) "define their attitude towards the majority of the Party as that of a Left wing of the Party and of the vanguard of the Russian proletariat, which preserves complete unity with the Party to the extent that the policy of the majority does not create an unavoidable split within the ranks of the proletariat itself.
'' (Our italics.
) · Declaring that they would render "every assistauce" to the Soviet government .
at the present moment "by taking part in it," the "Lefts" made the following reservation: "This participation is possible only on the basis of a definite political programme that will prevent the Soviet power and the majority of the Party from deviating to the fatal path of petty-bourgeois politics.
In the event of such a deviation, the Left wing of the Party will be obliged to take up the position of a businesslike and responsible proletarian opposition.
" The "Left" Communists tried to draw up such a programme, but as Lenin shows in the present article it consisted of nothing but general revolutionary phrases, suspended in the air, as it were, and having no basis in the objective conditions of the historical situation then prevailing.
This was the schismatic factional document which the "Left" Communists opposed to Lenin's plan of transitional measures to socialism, and which was published in No.
1 of Kommunist.
The intensification of the factional work of the "Left" Communists led to the decision of the Central Committee instructing Lenin to oppose them, and Lenin did so in his report on "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" at the April session of the All-Russian Central Executive Com­ mittee (see note to p.
313*) and in the present article.
Repeating the main arguments against the position of the "Left" Communists developed in previous articles and speeches in connection with the Brest Peace (see "Report on War and Peace at the Seventh Congress of the Russian Com­ munist Party [Bolsheviks]" and "Speech in Reply to the Debate" on this report in this volume), Lenin enlarges and gives the grounds for these a:rgmnents.
.
Summing up aill the ·di&agreementJJ with ithe Co=unists accused Lenin, the Central Committee and the Party as a whole of being Right opportunists and claimed to be the real revolutionary wing of the Party.
Lenin, in his article, shows that in fact they were revolutionary phrasemongers, that their "Left" revolution­ ary phrases did not take into account either the real relation of class forces in the country or the totality of the specific features of the situation at the time, and that therefore their "revolutionary" phrases and slogans in fact concealed real petty-bourgeois mentality, the real kinship of their position (on the question of the Brest-Litovsk Peace and on questions of internal policy) not only with the position of the petty-bourgeois Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party, but also with that of the direct hangers-on of the bourgeoi~ie, the Men­ sheviks and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries.
The "Left" Commumsts declared themselves to be the true representatives of the revolutionary proletariat.
Lenin shows (again using the example of their position on the question of the Brest­ Litovsk Peace and ·on questions of internal policy) that they were in fact re­ presentatives of petty-bourgeois vacillation, of the petty-bourgeois element, the expression ofthe striving of the petty bourgeois "driven to a frenzy by the hor­ rors of the imperialist war," and that this was precisely the source of the vapidity of their revolutionary phrases, of the closeness and kinship of their position with that of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.
The "Left" Communists asserted that they and not the majority of the Party were serv­ ing the cause of really developing the proletarian revolution in Soviet Russia and the world revolution.
Lenin shows that in fact their petty-bour­ geois mentality led them to serve the bourgeoisie, ·that objectively, owing to the kinship of their position with that of the petty-bourgeois parties, they were, to a certain extent, linking up with the bourgeois counter-revolution represented by Milyukov and Co.
, for example on the question of the Brest­ Litovsk Peace, by repeating what the Milyukovs had been howling about.
This characterisation of the "Left" Communists runs like a red thread through all Lenin's pronouncements against them.
Lenin had applied a similar characterisation before this to the "Left" trends known as otzovists, ultimatumists and Vperyod-ists in the period of reaction after the Revolu­ tion of 1905-07 (see note top.
296**), and in the main it was later applied to the "Left" Communists in the West (see Selected Works, Vol.
X, "'Left­ Wing' Communism, an Infantil~ Disorder") ; and this characterisation was applicable to the so-called "Left" trends and trendlets, groups and grouplets in the C.
P.
S.
U.
and other Communist Parties.
This characterisation fully applied to the "Left" so-called "new opposition" (1925-26), and to the Trotsky­ Zinoviev bloc (1926-27), which drifted into the camp of the bourgeois counter­ revolution and actually became its vanguard.
It also fully applied to the semi-Trotskyist "Leftism" of 1928-30, this smallest and least influential "Left" trend in the C.
P.
S.
U.
which, through the medium of the Right-Leftist double­ dealing bloc of the Syrtsov and Lominadze groups, btmame a link in the with bourgeois counter-revolution.
After the severe blows delivered against th"'.
m by the Party headed by Lenin at the end of April and beginning of May 1918, the "Left" Commun­ ist factional group rapidly declined and lost the last remnants of its influence in the ranks of the Party_ and of the working class.
Even in this article Lenin is fully justified in referring to it as a "small group," to such an extent had it dwindled after its defeat at the Seventh Congress of the Party and at the Fourth, Extraordinary Congress of Soviets, notwithstanding the factional work it had been carrying on.
On May 15, the Moscow Regional Con· ference of the Party adopted Lenin's Theses "On the Present Situation," and the "Lefts" thus lost their stronghold in the Moscow Regional Bureau.
Soon after they lost their second stronghold, the Urals Regional Committee.
They still made attempts to continue their factional struggle; they demanded that a special congress of the Party be converred, again threatened a split, etc.
; but these were the last efforts of the dying opposition.
By the end of the summer of 1918 the majority of the "Lefts" confessed their errors and dissolved their faction.
It must be said, however, that many of the "Left" Communists subsequently joined new opposition groups, particularly the Group of Democratic Centralism of 1920-21 and the Trotskyist opposition of 1923-24 and 1926-28.
The significance of the article " 'Left-Wing' Childishness and Petty-Bour· geois Mentality" is by no means confined to the enormous role it played in causing the dissolution of the "Left" Communist faction and as an indispens· able theoretical weapon in the hands of the C.
P.
S.
U.
and of the Communist International in the fight against "Left" Communism.
On the basis of the struggle against "Left" Communism, this article gives the profound theoretical foundation of the plan of socialist construction outlined in Lenin's "Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government.
" Even in 1921 it served as the finished theoretical basis for the transition to the New Economic Policy (in note to p.
313* it was pointed out that Lenin used this article for this purpose in his pamphlet The Food Tax, for which see Selected Works, Vol.
lX).
By its analysis of the social-economic systems existing in the country and of the fundamental economic and class antagonisms prevailing in it (Part III), it provided the theoretical basis for the Party's policy in sociali§t construction and for the class struggle against the bourgeoisie and the petty-bourgeois element for the whole of the epoch of transition.

* The main and characteristiQ.
Jeature of the class struggle in Ger· many during many ·decades of the nineteenth century was the fact that the France and England, and disturbed by the labour movement in its own country, submitted to the leadership of the .
T unkers (landlords) who, in pursuit of their own interests, remained at the head of the state, but grad­ ually adapted the latter to the requirements of capitalist development and of the bourgeoisie.
In 1871 the Bismarck government, which was a Junker government, succeeded in bringing about the unification of Gei:many in a single empire.
This unification was called forth by the reqmrements of capitalist development.
A bloc was formed between the Junkers and the bourgeoisie; and this bloc was possible because the Jwnker class was gra~­ ually being drawn into capitalist production and itself assumed a bourgeois hue.
· Engels wrote: "The Junkers are a landlord class only to the extent that they largely allow their _land to be cultivated by .
tenant farmers; over and above that they are often owners of distilleries and beet-sugar refineries.
" Subsequently, with the development of German imperialism, the big landlords became directors of banks, joint stock companies, etc.
Thus, a gradual merg· ing of the interests of the J wnkers and the bourgeoisie took place.
This put its impress on the economics and politics of imperialist Germany of the twentieth century, which Lenin here characterises as "Junker-bourgeois imperialism.
" PAGE 371.
* By "the compromise of a section of the Bolsheviks in October­ November 1917" Lenin means the position taken up at that time by a group of Rights headed by Kamenev, Zinoviev and Rykov.
This position found expression in: I) the notorious strike-breaking conduct of Kamenev and Zinoviev on the eve of the October Revolution; 2) their conduct immediately after the October Revolution, when they insisted that the Soviet government be made up of representatives "of all Socialist parties" includ· ing the Narodni-Socialists, who in fact were semi-Cadets; 3) the conduct of Kamenev, Zinoviev, Ryazanov and Larin, who, contrary to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party, persisted in advocating this point of view during the negotiations concerning the composition of the government conducted with .
the representatives of other parties at the meetings of the All-Russian Central Executive .
Committee, and also at the meetings of the Bolshevik fraction of the latter; and 4) after the Central Committee of the Party had presented an ultimatum to the Rights in this connection, the resignation of Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov, Milyutin, Ryazanov, Larin,.
Nogin, Teodorovich and others from their responsible posts on the Central Com­ mittee and in the Soviet government.
The same policy was pursued by this group later on, in December of that year, at the meetings of !the Bolshevik fraction of the Constituent Assembly at which, also contrary to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Party, they urged that the Socialist-Revolutionary Constituent Assembly be preserved and that a "combined type of state" consisting of bourgeois democracy and the Soviets be established.
The whole position taken up by the Rights in October-Russia alone, and from their striving at all costs to restrict the revolution within bourgeois-democratic limits.
This point of view was expressed by Kame­ nev as early as April 1917 in his speeches in opposition to Lenin's April Theses, and in the speeches of the Rights (Kamenev, Rykov and others) at the All-Russian April Conference of the Party.
These Menshevik-Trotskyist posi­ tions, as well as their lack of principle, their unscrupulousness in the choice of means, their adventurism and duplicity, of which they made a sy~tem, led Kamenev and Zinoviev through the "new" Leningrad opposition of 1926 to the Trotskyist bloc of 1926:27, with its counter-revolutionary demonstrations against the Party and the Soviet government.
Subsequently Kamenev and Zinoviev sank to the role of organisers and leaders of illegal counter-revolu­ tionary groups-the "Leningrad Centre," which committed the vile assassin­ ation of Comrade Kirov, and the "Moscow Centre"-became organisers and leaders of individual terrorism.
against leaders of the Party, acting in direct contact with the agents of capitalist governments.

One of the central points discussed at the Congress of Represen­ tatives of Finance Departments of the local Soviets, at which Lenin delivered this speech, was the question of the introduction of an income and property tax.
The necessity for this measure was called forth by the very severe financial position of the country.
In the first half of 1918 revenues amounted to 3,294,000,000 rubles, while expenditures amounted to 20,~80,000,000 rubles, not counting expenditure on the maintenance of the commissariats, the Supreme Council of National Economy, and the rail­ ways.
Emphasising that "in the first period the proletariat could not dispense with contributions," i.
e.
, imposition of levies on the bourgeoisie, Lenin considered it necessary in the spring of 1918, in -connection with his plan of creating the prerequisites for the transition to socialism, outlined in his ar.
ticle .
"The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" (in this volume), to pass from the system _of contributions to obtaining revenues by means of an income tax.
The "Left" Communists could not-understand the need for this change and believed that the abandonment ol.
.
contributions was a turn to the Right, I l for Finance, Gukovsky, at a meeting of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee who in the main supported Lenin's financial proposals.
Dur­ ing the d~bate on this report BuK.
harin declared that Guk?vsky's prop~sals meant renunciation of the line the Party had been pursumg all the time.
And yet it was precisely from the point of view of the struggle against the class enemy that the introduction of an income and property tax was the most correct thing to do at that time.
Lenin dealt with this question in his speech to the delegates of the congress and emphasi~ed the significa~ce in principle of an income and pi:operty tax as a weapon m the fight agamst the bourgeoisie.

* In April 1918 a plan called the "Meshchersky plan'.
' was bei~g discussed by the .
Council of People's Commissars and by the Soviet economic organisations.
This was a plan to combine the principal iro~, and steel enterprises in Russia into a single enterprise, the shares of which-were to be distributed between the manufacturers and the state.
Meshchersky was a big capitalist manufacturer at that time.
On April 18 the Council of Peo~~e's Commissars finally rejected the "Meshchersky plan" and adopted a dec1s10n to nationalise the iron and steel and engineering industries.
On May 12-18 a c~nference of representatives of nationalised enterprises was held for the purpose of discussing the questions connected with the nationalisation ~f the large enterprises such as the Sormovo Works, Kolomna Works, Baltic Works etc.
, and it is to this conference that Lenin's letter was addressed.
The c~n:ference passed a resolution in favour of the nationalisation of the iron and steel works and elected a proYisional committee for the purpose of organising the combined state iron and steel works.
However, there were differences of opinion on this question at the conference.
For example, Professor Grinevetsky, a violent opponent of the Soviet system of economy, demanded the adoption of the "Meshchersky plan," while a number ?f engineers attending the conference abstained from voting.
Subsequently, m the course of the wreckers' trial in 1930, it was disclosed that Meshchersky, in conjunction with a large group of ex-manufacturers, had adopted a num­ ber of measures for the purpose of paralysing the work of the nationalised industry.

Mental­ ity m this volume).
Instead of submitting to the decrees of the Soviet go~ernment, they began to organise civil war against the victorious prole­ ~ar~~t, under t~e leade~ship and with the assistance of Anglo-French imper­ ialism.
That rs why, rnr the sphere of national economy the task was to acc_elerate the transition from the policy of "workers' accou~ting and control " ~hich allowed controlled capitalists to take part in the mana"ement ~f rndustry on the basis of state capitalism under the proletarian st:te to the -workers' manage~ent ?f industry, by steadily nationalising industry' branch by branch, startmg with the most important.
On this question the First Congress of Councils of National Economy at which Lenin delivered this speech resolved: "In the sphere of the organisation of production it is necess~ry t?.

" Up to that tu~ie, the.
ba~ks, water transport, the sugar industry and a number of enter­ ~nses, pnnc1pally those abandoned bY.
the capitalists, had been nationalised.
in.
every enterprise that passed into the possession of the state, two-thirds of the management was appointed either by the Regional or the All-Russian Councils of Na~ionaI Economy.
Half the number of candidates for these posts ~ere nommated either by the Regional or the All-Russian Executive Committees of the trade un~ons.
One-third of the members of the manage­ ment board.
of each enterpnse was elected for six months by the members of tr~de umons employed in the particular enterprise.
An obligatory rule was tn~t ?~e-t~ird of the management board of the.
enterprise shall consist of ~pec1ahsis rrom the ranks of the technical and commercial staff.
The ~·e~10nal :iranagement boards of the nationalised industries were elected at Jomt reg10n~l conferences of re.
presentatives of factory management boards and of regional committees of tra-de unions, and were endorsed by the of National Economy.
The central management boards of the nationalised enterprises were elected at joint All-Russian conferences of factory_ manage­ ment boards and of All-Russian E:x;ecutive Committees of trade umons, and were endorsed by the Supreme Council of National Economy.
The Supreme Council of National Economy consisted of ten representatives of the All­ Russian Central Executive Committee, thirty representatives of All-Russian industrial unions, twenty representatives of Regional Councils of National Economy, two representatives of the co-operative societies, and one represen­ tative each of the Commissariats of Food, Ways of Communication, Labour, Agriculture, Finance, and Trade and Industry.
The Supreme Council of National Economy was the supreme economic body in the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
, and as the economic organ of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee was_ responsible to the latter and to the Council of People's Commissars.
The function of the Supreme Council of National Economy and of its local organs was to organise the whole of production, distribution and the financ­ ing of national economy.
The wider the nationalisation of industry was to be introduced, the more important and responsible was to be the role of the Supreme Council of Natir,nal Economy as the organiser and builder of large-scale socidist industry, which is the foundation of socialism.
In greeting the First Congress of Councils of National Economy, Lenin starts his speech with an explanation of the role of the Supreme Council of National Economy and of its local organs as the organisers of -socialist ·economy, as organs which, even in their rudimentary form, are the prototype of the organs of management of national economy in socialist society.
Emphasising the enormous importance of the organisational tasks confronting the Supreme Council of National Economy and the local Councils of National Economy, Lenin, in complete accord with the fundamental line concerning the socialist sector of national economy as laid down in his article "The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government" (in this volume), calls the attention of the congress particularly to the necessity of utilising bourgeois specialists and to the development of labour discipline.
In concluding his speech he warned the delegates not to allow them· selves "to be misled by those people, hy those classes, by the bourgeoisie .
.
.
whose sole task is to sow panic, to cause despondency, to cause complete despondency concerning the whole of our work, to make it appear to be hope­ less.
" Incidentally:, Lenin had in mind here the "Left" Communists who were then still attacking the Party line, although this was their last attack.
On the question of the economic situation and economic policy that was before the congress, the "Left" Communists put up Ossinsky as a co-reporter to oppose the main report.
All the principles he enunciated on questions of economic policy were a repetition of tbose contained in the platform of the "Left" Communisti;;, which Lenin criticised in his article " 'Left-Wing' 83* industrial apparatus is so dislocated that every sensible man must admit that international intervention is necessary to restore it.
" "The only way to restore the productive forces of our cou~try and of the whole world is to stop the war in all parts of the world m the way we stopped it in Russia, i.
e.
, overthrow the power ?£ finan~e ca~ital in ~II countries; if this is done, then, with the energetic mternat10n~l mterventlon of the world proletariat, the wounds inflicted by the war will be healed.
From this a practical conclusion must be drawn.
We cannot indulge in rosy dreams about being able to do anything with the aid of our own internal, domestic resources, by demobilising the army, and by.
organisational .
work.
" Thus, according to Ossinsky, unless the assistance of the victorious world proletariat was obtained the dictatorship of the proletariat in Soviet Russia was doomed either t~ fall .
or to degenerate.
This panicky speech strikingly confirmed the kinship of the fundamental principles of the "Left" Communists with those of Men­ shevism and its other variety, Trotskyism, for it copied the Trotskyist theory that the building of socialism in the U.
S.
S.
R.
was imuoesible without a victory of the proletariat in the West; and it anticipated Trotsky's chatter of 1926-28 about the degeneration of the Soviet power.
It was against such criticism of-the Party line on the part of the Mensheviks Socialist­ Revolutionaries and "Left" Communists that Lenin, in his spee~h warned the delegates at this congress.

* The Conference of Moscow Trade Unions and Factory Committees of June 27-28, 1918, at which this "Report on the Present Situation" was made was held at one of the most acute moments in the history of the Soviet power.
The Civil War had entered into the second stage of its developm~nt ;-vh~n the Anglo-French imperialists were taking a direct and leading part lil It.
The Czecho-Slovak mutiny organised by the French Mission with the aid of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in May 1918 enabled the counter-revolutionary forces to be concentrated along the whole lene:th of the S_iberian Railway.
Under their protection a Socialist-Revolution;ry­ Menshev1k government was set up in Samara, a Siberian government was set up in Siberia, Ataman Dutov again app.
eared in Orenburg, and Ataman Sem~onov in Trans-Baikal.
The Japanese, who at the end of July occupied Vladivostok and Nikolsk-Ussuriisk, were in command of the Far East.
In the Far North the British were in command, and in the beginning of August they occupied Archangel and Murmansk.
In the course of March-April the Germans occupied the Ukraine and Donbas.
Under their protection the Volunteer Army of Krasnov and Denikin consolidated itself and devel­ oped.
In July-August the Soviet power in the Kuban, on the Terek and in Daghestan was broken.
With the direct assistance at first of Kaiser Germany and Turkey, and later of the Entente, the Mensheviks came into power in i l ~·, ~-\.

The Land of the Soviets was surrounded by a close ring of counter­ revolutionary rebellions and military fronts, and was cut off from the impor­ tant sources of food (the Ukraine, Kuban, Siberia), o,f raw materials, coal, iron ore (Donbas), and from the oil sources of Baku and Grozny.
Industry and transport were in a state of crisis and the food crisis was particularly acute.
Famine was marching against the towns, against the working class, against the as yet unconsolidated Red Army, which ~as created in the fire ,,of the struggle against the counter-revolution, and famme threatened to disrupt the struggle for the proletarian dictatorship on the fronts of the raging Civil War.
It is to this di~aster of famine that Lenin devoted his report.
In it he calls upon the working class to fight ~he famine, to organise workers' food detachments for the purpose of puttmg the state grain monopoly into actual operation, for the purpose of sequ,ester­ ing, with the aid of the rural poor, the grain from the rural kulaks, arid for the purpose of confiscating.
the stocks of grain from the urb~n bourgeoisie.
Indeed, the food front at that time was one of the fronts m the Civil War.
The fight for bread was a fight against the counter-revolu­ tion and for the dictatorship of the proletariat, for socialism.
Lenin devoted enormous attention to the struggle for bread throughout the period of the dictatorship of the proletariat during his lifetime precisely as a strn.
ggle for socialism; and in that period of raging civil war with which we are now dealing, the attention he paid to the struggle for br~d was positively exceptional.
The report now under review is only one of Lenin's reports, speeches, articles, and letters on this subject.
_In Selected Works Vol.
VIII the reader will find another speeial report by Lenin on the fight against the famine, a telegram and letters to the workers about organising this fight in · the same stage of the Civil War with which the present report deals, and other letters and articles by Lenin on the same subject dealing with other periods.

* The unceasing imperialist war, the econoipic ruin caused by it the acute food situation and the influence of the Octoher Revolution in Russia all gave rise, in the beginning of 1918, to a broad movement of the toilers of Austria-Hungary under the slogan of "Bread and Peace.
" In January 1918 strikes broke out in Vienna, Briin:n, Cracow, Budapest and other towns.
· In Vienna and Budapest, Soviets of Workers' 'Deputies were set up.
Only with the aid of the Austrian Social-Democrats was the govern­ ment able to suppress the strikes and disperse the Soviets.

* The German troops occupied the Ukraine mainly for the purpose of obtaining food supplies.
According to the first treaty concluded with the Ukrainian Rada, the latter undertook to supply Germany with 980,000 tons of grain; and by a supplementary agreement it undertook to deliver of butter, fats, etc.
The Rada could not fulfil this undertaking.
The government of Skoropadsky, which succeeded the Rada could do no m Tl G T ' ore.
.
1e ern:a~ m1 ita? command then resorted to requisitions and to the send-mg of military umts to the rural districts to sequester the food.
These mea~~res failed, however, and only 9,132 carloads of grain were obtained.
The mcessant guerrilla war carried on by the workers and neasants a number of uprisings of the population, and the increase of r;volution,ary ~erme~t ~mong the German occupational troops themselves;· prevented German imperialism from plundering the food of the Ukraine.

* The demand for the publication of the secret treatie~ in order ~o provide docurnenta1 proof of the real character and aims of the imperial­ rnt war was advanced by the Bolsheviks immediately after the February Revolution.
In his "Draft Theses of March 30 [17], 1917," Len,in wrote that the Provisional Government "is keeping secret the predatory treaties made by tsarism with England, France, Italy, Japan, etc.
It wants to conceal from the people the truth about its war programme and the fact that it is for war, for victory over Gennany" (Collected Works, Vol.
XX).
The fight the Bolsheviks waged for the publication of the secret treaties and the refusal of the Provisional Government and the Mensheviks and Socialist­ Revolutionaries who supported it helped the masses to understand that the war was continuing to be waged for the annexation of new territories and for the oppression of new nationalities.
1 ~he publi~ation of the secret treaties began soon after the October Rev­ o.
ution, notwithstanding the protests of the ambassadors of the "Allied" pow_ers.
As became evident after the publication of the secret treaties,· the tsarist government counted on obtaining as a result of the war Constantin-.
ople and the Dardanelles Straits, and the regions of Trebizond.

** This refers to the events of January 22 [9], 1905, which are regarded as the beginning of the Russian Revolution of 1905-07.
On and led by the priest, Father Gapon, march~d unanned, carrying icons and sacred banners, to the Winter Palace to petition the tsar to improve the conditions of life of the working class and to grant political 'liberty.
The demonstrators were· shot down by troops which had been called out before­ hand.
About 3,000 persons were killed and injured.
The -events of January 22 [9] revealed even to the most backward workers that if they wanted to achieve any improvement in their condition,s they would have to fight to overthrow the tsarist autocracy.

* Lenin's forecast was very soon confirmed by events.
At the end of October and beginning of Noveinber 1918 the revolution overthrew the monarchy in Austria-Hungary, which, in the prnce.

* Lenin raised the question of nationalising the large industrial combines and syndicates as early as April 1917 (see "The Tasks of the Proiet~riat in Our Revolution" in Selected Works, Vol.
VI).
He was of the opinion that in addition to the nationalisation of the banks, this was a measure which was dictated by the economic state of the country and which the proletariat had to introduce after laking power; and that only in an extreme case was the proletariat to confine itself for a time to the introduc­ tion of immediate workers' control of the syndicates and banks.
In his pamphlet The Threatening Catastrophe and How To Fight It he developed the idea of nationalising large-scale industry in greater detail.
(See Collected Works, Vol.
XXI, and also the article "The Aims of the Revolution" in Selec­ ted Works, Vol.
VI.
) He was of the opinion that it would be possible im­ mediately to nationalise only the more centralised branches of industry such as the oil, coal, iron and steel and sugar industries.
In regard .
to the other branches of industry, he thought that workers' control should first be intro­ duced as a transitional measure to nationalisation.
After the October Revolution the actual nationalisation of industry proceeded in the following way.
In retaliation to the refusal of the capital­ ists to fulfil the orders of the Soviet government soon after the October Revo­ lution the following large enterprises were nationalised: in the Urals-the Bogoslav, Sim, and Kishtim enterprises; in the Donbas--the Russo-Baltic Iron and Steel Company, and in Petrograd--the Putilov, Neva and Sestroretsk Works, the 1880 Company and the Electric Transmission Company.
The mines, the Baku oilwells and the iron and steel industry in the south of Russia, but this was prevente!l by the occupation of the Ukraine by the Germans.
In May the remnants of the sugar industry were nationalised and in June the oil industry was nationalised.
In the middle of June a group of large engineering and iron and steel works, such as the Sormovo-Kolomna Works (six works) and the group cf large chemic;! works belonging to Ushkov and Co.
were nationalised.
By the middle of 1918 the government had in its possession 80 per cent of the mines and works in the Urals, and 50 per cent of all the metal-working enterprises in Russia.
The -further nationalisation of industry was greatly accelerated by the Civil War which flared up in the beginning of 1918 · and by the necessity, in view of this, of economically disarming the bourgeoisie.
On June 28 a decree was issued on the nationalisa­ tion cf the medium and large industrial enterprises which affected over 2,000 enterprises.
After the issue of this decree the process of nationalisation pro­ ceeded so rapidly that by the end of 1<;20 from 70 to 80 per cent of the scheduled industries were nationalised.
-The process of nationalisation was completed after the issue of the Decree of November 29, 1920, on the nationalisation of all small industrial enter­ prises with mechanical driving power employing more than five workers, and those without mechanical driving power employing more than ten workers.
