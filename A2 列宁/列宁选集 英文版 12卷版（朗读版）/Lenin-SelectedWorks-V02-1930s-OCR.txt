491 PREFACE Volume II of the Selected Works of Lenin covers the period from 1900 to 1904 inclusive.
During these five years Lenin wrote some of his most important works, in which he form’ ulated the programme, the tactics and the organisational prin­ ciples of revolutionary Social-Democracy.
The initial period of the history of Russian Social-Democracy ended at about the turn of the century.
Lenin divided this period into the following subdivisions: 1) approximately from 1884 to 1894, the period of “the rise and consolidation of the theory’ and programme of Social-Democracy”; 2) the period from 1894 to 1898, in which Social-Democracy appears “as a social move­ ment, as a rising of the masses of the people and as a political party,” and 3) the period from 1897 to 1898, which was a pe­ riod of “dispersion, dissolution and vacillation” in the ranks of Social-Democracy, and the period of the determined struggle against this “dispersion and dissolution” that was waged by the revolutionary Marxists.
The fight culminated in the rise and growth of the Iskraist trend in Russian Social-Democracy which ushered in the Iskra period in the history of the Party.
It was in this period that Bolshevism took shape.
At the Second Congress of the Party it was already, to use Lenin's words, “a school of political thought, a political party.
” The Second Congress of the Party and the period following it was marked by the struggle between the majority and the minority which was in fact the struggle between the two tenden­ cies in Russian Social-Democracy, namely, the proletarian rev­ olutionary tendency and the petty-bourgeois reformist tendency.
The contents of the present volume are grouped in two sections; the first covers the Iskra period, and the second, the Xi period of the Party Congress and the struggle between the ma­ jority and the minority.
The former period begins with the rise and growth of Iskra and the work of the /sfcra-ists in Russia.
Iskra was founded in 1900, the end of what Lenin classified as the third transitional period (see Volume I), a period particularly marked by “dis­ persion” and “vacillation.
” Together with Zarya, Iskra from the very outset took the high road of political struggle for revolutionary Marxism, for the Party.
Lenin comes forward as the leader of the orthodox (subsequently the Bolshevik) wing of the Party, and the ideas of Leninism become the banner round which all the revolutionary elements in the Social-Democratic movement rally in the fight.
The writings of this period include What Is To Be Done? (1902), a work of genius and of the greatest importance.
It condenses all the Zsfera-isl ideas, and presents a number of generalisations of the revolutionary experience of Social-Demo­ cratic work, an experience which was to acquire the greatest significance not only for the development of Bolshevism in Rus­ sia, but for the Communist Parties abroad as well.
In champion­ ing the idea of a monolithic, centralised party armed with a revolutionary theory, Lenin concentrates his attack on Econ-omism, the main opportunist trend in Russian Social-Democracy at that time.
He puts forward the slogan of organising a centralised nucleus of professional revolutionaries as the neces­ sary condition for the abandonment of primitive methods and khvostism^ i.
e.
, dragging at the tail of the movement instead of leading it, and for raising the Party’s work to a higher level.
What Is To Be Done? develops and carries further the fight for the Party which Iskra started from the outset Lenin describes it as an “epitome of Iskra-ist tactics, and of Iskra's organisa­ tional policy in 1901-02,” Besides a number of articles written by Lenin in these years which appeared in Iskra, the present volume contains works that appeared in Zarya, the theoretical organ of revolutionär)" Social-Democracy, viz.
, The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism (1901), The Agrarian Programme of Russian, Social-Democracy (1902) and the popular pamphlet To the Rural Poor (1902), which expounded and gave the grounds for the agrarian programme of the Party in connection with its general programme and which was extremely important in popularising the programme of the Party among the masses of the workers.
Part II of this volume covers the period of the Second Con­ gress and of the split in the R.

The exceptional im­ portance of this period in the history of the Party is a matter of common knowledge.
It was then that the subsequent develop­ ment of the revolutionary and the reformist wings of the Social-Democratic movement in Russia was determined and Bolshevism took shape.
It was precisely in this period that the line of Lenin and the Bolsheviks for a “rupture, for a split with op­ portunism, here, in the Russian Social-Democratic Party, and over there, in the Second International” (Stalin), became quite clearly defined, a line, which, starting with the formation of the Bolshevik Party, led to the final organisational rupture with the opportunists in Russia at the Prague Conference in 1912, to the final rupture with the Second International at the be­ ginning of the wrar, and the formation of the Third, Communist International in 1919.
In the course of the fierce fight against opportunism in its new form of Menshevism, and of the “con-ciliationism” which appeared at the end of 1903 and the begin­ ning of 1904, Lenin wrote a number of articles and pamphlets including: An Account of the Second Congress of the R.

to the Sec­ ond Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democrats Abroad (1903); One Step Forward, Two Steps Back (1904) ; The Zemstvo Campaign and “Iskra’s” Plan (1904).
Lenin’s fight against the organisational opportunism of the Mensheviks developed into a fight against their opportunism in tactical questions, which became apparent on the eve of the Revolution of 1905.
Thus, the period after the Second Congress forms, as it were, a transition period to the fight for revolution­ ary Bolshevik tactics in that revolution, for armed insurrection and for the revolutionary-democratic dictatorship of the prolet­ ariat and the peasantry.
In summing up his writings for the first twelve years of his literary activity, in the Preface to the symposium Twelve Years, that is to say, for a period which roughly corresponds to the one covered by Volumes I and II of Selected Works, and speak­ ing of the stubborn fight against the opportunist Right wing of the Russian Social-Democratic movement which the Party had to wage (and which was primarily the work of Lenin himself), Lenin says: “When we look back at the struggle between the two tenden­ cies in Russian Marxism and in Russian Social-Democracy dur­ ing these twelve years (1895-1907) the conclusion forces itself upon us that ‘legal Marxism,’ ‘Economism,’ and ‘Menshevism’ are different manifestations of the same historical tendency.
The ‘legal Marxism’ of Struve (1894), and the like, was the reflec­ tion of Marxism in bourgeois literature.
‘Economism,’ as a dis­ tinct tendency in the Social-Democratic movement in 1897 and the following years, in reality put into practice the pro­ gramme of the bourgeois liberal 'Credo*1: economic struggle for the workers—political struggle for the liberals.
Menshevism is not merely a tendency in literature, not merely a tendency in Social-Democratic work; it is an organised faction, which, dur­ ing the first period of the Russian revolution (1905-07), pur­ sued a distinct policy which virtually subordinated the pro­ letariat to bourgeois liberalism” The present volume covers the period that is covered by Volumes II and III of the Collected Works of Lenin.
It is obvious that a considerable part of his writings of this period had to be omitted.
This includes a number of articles on subjects that are treated in works contained in the present volume, a considerable number of articles published in Iskra, and of letters and notes referring to the period of the split after the Second Congress of the R.

PART I THE FIGHT FOR THE VANGUARD PARTY.
TACTICS, ORGANISATION AND PROGRAMME 1 Lenin 11 DECLARATION BY THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF ISKRA In undertaking the publication of a political newspaper, Iskra* we consider it necessary to say a few words about our aims and what we understand our tasks to be.
We are passing through an extremely important period in the history of the Russian labour movement and of Russian Social-Democracy.
The past few years have been marked by an astonishingly rapid spread of Social-Democratic ideas among our intelligentsia, and coming forward to meet tins tendency of social ideas is the movement of the industrial proletariat, which arose independently, and which is beginning to unite and to fight against its oppressors, is beginning eagerly to strive towards socialism.
Circles of workers and Social-Democratic intelligentsia are springing up everywhere; local agitation leaflets are beginning to be distributed, the demand for Social-Demo­ cratic literature is increasing and is far outstripping the supply, while the intensified persecution by the government is powerless to restrain this movement.
The prisons and the places of exile are filled to overflowing.
Hardly a month goes by without our hearing of Socialists being “discovered” in all parts of Russia, of the capture of literature-carriers, and the confiscation of literature and printing presses—but the movement goes on and grows, spreads to a wider area, penetrates more and more deep­ ly into the working class, and attracts increasing public at­ tention to itself.
The entire economic development of Russia, the history of the development of social ideas in Russia and of the Russian revolutionary movement serve as a guarantee that the Russian Social-Democratic labour movement will grow and ultimately surmount all the obstacles that confront it.
On the other hand, the principal feature of our movement, and one which has become particularly marked in recent times, is its state of disunity and its primitive character—if one may 3 r »o express it.
Local circles spring up and function independently of one another and (what is particularly important) even of circles which have functioned and now function simultaneously in the same district.
Traditions are not established and con­ tinuity is not maintained; the local literature entirely reflects this disunity and lack of contact with what Russian Social-Democracy lias already created.
This state of disunity runs counter to the requirements called forth by the strength and breadth of the movement, and this, in our opinion, marks a critical moment in its history.
In the movement itself the need is strongly felt for consolidation and for definite form and organisation; and yet many active Social-Democrats still fail to realise the need for the movement pass­ ing to a higher form.
On the contrary, among wide circles an ideological wavering is observed, an absorption in the fashionable “criticism of Marxism” and “Bernsteinism,” in spreading the news of the so-called “Economist” tendency and, what is inseparably connected with it, the effort to keep the movement at its lowest stage, an effort to push into the back­ ground the task of forming a revolutionary" party to lead the struggle at the head of the whole people.
Il is a facl that such an ideological wavering is observed among Russian Social-Democrats, that narrow practical work carried on without a theor­ etical conception of the movement as a whole threatens to divert the movement to a false path.
No one who has direct knowledge of the state of affairs in the majority of our organ­ isations has any doubt whatever on that score.
Moreover, liter­ ary productions exist which confirm this.
It is sufficient to mention the Credo which has already evoked legitimate protest, the Special Supplement to Rabochaya Mysl (September 1899),* which brought out in such bold relief the tendency with which Rabochaya Mysl is thoroughly imbued, and, finally, the Mani­ festo of the St.
Petersburg Self-Emancipation of the Working -Class group,** drawn up in the spirit of this very Economism.
The assertions made by Rabocheyc Dyelo to the effect that the Credo merely represents the opinions of individuals, that the tendency represented by Rabochaya Mysl reflects merely the con-fusion of mind and the tactlessness of its editors, and not a spe­ cial tendency in the progress of the Russian labour movement, are absolutely untrue.
* Simultaneously with this, the works of authors whom the Heading public lias with more or less reason regarded up to now as the prominent representatives of “legal Marxism” more and more reveal a turn towards views approaching those of bour­ geois apologists.
As a result of all this, we have the confusion and anarchy which enabled tlie ex-Marxist, or, to speak more correctly, the ex-Socialist, Bernstein, in recounting his successes, to declare unchallenged in the press that the majority of Social-Democrats active in Russia were his followers.
We do not desire to exaggerate the danger of the situation, but it would be immeasurably more harmful to shut our eyes to it.
That is why we welcome with all our heart the decision of the Emancipation of Labour group to resume its literary activity and commence a systematic struggle against the at­ tempts to distort and vulgarise Social-Democracy.
The practical conclusion to be drawn from all this is as fol­ lows: we Russian Social-Democrats must combine and direct all our efforts towards the formation of a strong party that will fight under the united banner of revolutionary Social-Democracy.
This is precisely the task that was outlined by the Congress in 1898, at which the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was formed, and which published its Manifesto.
We regard ourselves as members of this Party; we entirely agree with the fundamental ideas contained in the Manifesto, and attach extreme importance to it as a public declaration of its aims.
Consequently, for us, as members of the Party, the question as to what our immediate and direct tasks are presents itself as follows: what plan of activity must we adopt in order to revive the Party on the firmest possible basis? Hie reply usually given to this question is that it is neces­ sary to elect a central Party institution once more and to in­ struct that body to resume the publication of the Party organ.
But in the confused period through which we are now passing such a simple method is hardly expedient.
To establish and consolidate the Party means establishing and consolidating unity among all Russian Social-Democrats, and, for the reasons indicated above, such unity cannot be brought about by decree; it cannot be brought about by, let us say, a meeting of representatives passing a resolution.
Definite work must be done to bring it about.
In the first place, it is nec­ essary to bring about unity of ideas which will remove the differ­ ences of opinion and confusion that—we will be frank—reign among Russian Social-Democrats at the present lime.
This unity of ideas must be fortified by a unified Party programme.
Secondly, an organisation must be set up especially for the purpose of maintaining contact among all the centres of the movement, for supplying complete and timely information about the movement, and for regularly distributing the periodical press to all parts of Russia.
Only when we have built such an organisation, only when we have created a Russian socialist mailing system, wdll the permanent existence of the Party be assured, only then will it become a real factor and, con­ sequently, a mighty political force.
To the first half of this task, i.
e.
, creating a common literature, consistent in principle and capable of ideologically uniting revolutionary Social-Dem­ ocracy, we intend to devote our efforts, for we regard this as one of the pressing tasks of the present-day movement and a necessary preliminary measure towards the resumption of Party activity.
As we have already said, the intellectual unity of Russian Social-Democrats has still to be established, and in order to achieve this it is necessary, in our opinion, to have an open and thorough discussion of the fundamental principles and tactical questions raised by the present-day Economists, Bemsteinists and 4‘critics.
” Before we can unite, and in order that we may unite, we must first of all firmly and definitely draw’ the lines of demarcation.
Otherwise, our unity will be merely a fictitious unity, which will conceal the prevailing confusion and prevent its complete elimination.
Naturally, therefore, we do not intend to utilise our publication merely as a storehouse for various views.
On the contrary, we shall conduct it along the lines of a strictly defined tendency.
Tliis tendency can be expressed by the word Marxism, and there is hardly need to add that we stand for the consistent development of the ideas of Marx and Engels, and utterly reject the half-way, vague and opportunistic emendations which have now become so fashionable as a result of the legerdemain of Ed.
Bernstein, P.
Struve and many others.
But while discussing all questions from our own definite point of view, we shall not rule out of our columns polemics between comrades.
Open polemics within the sight and hearing of all Russian Social-Democrats and class conscious workers are neces­ sary and desirable, in order to explain the profound differences that exist, to obtain a comprehensive discussion of disputed ques­ tions, and to combat the extremes into which the representatives, not only of various views, but also of various localities or vari­ ous “crafts” in the revolutionary movement inevitably fall.
As has already been stated, we also consider one of the drawbacks of the present-day movement to be the absence of open polemics among those holding avowedly differing views, an effort to con­ ceal the differences that exist over extremely serious questions.
We shall not enumerate in detail all the questions and themes included in the programme of our publication, for this pro­ gramme automatically emerges from the general conception of what a political newspaper, published under present conditions, should be.
We shall exert even* effort to persuade every Russian oom-rade to regard our publication as his own.
as one to which every group should communicate information concerning the movement, in which to relate its experiences, express its views, its literature requirements, its opinions on Social-Denio cratic publications, in fact to make it the medium through which it can share with the other groups the contribution it makes to tliv movement and what it receives from it.
Only in this way will it be possible to establish a genuinely all-Russian organ of Social-Democracy.
Only such an organ will be capable of lead­ ing the movement onto the high road of the political struggle.
“Push out the framework and broaden the content of our propa­ ganda, agitational and organisational activity”—these words uttered by P.
B.
Axelrod must serve as our slogan defining the activities of Russian Social-Democrats in the immediate future, and we adopt this slogan in the programme of our organ.
We appeal not only to Socialists and class conscious work­ ers; we also call upon all those who are oppressed by the pres­ ent political system.
We place the columns of our publication at their disposal in order that they may expose all the abomina­ tions of the Russian autocracy.
Those who regard Social-Democracy as an organisation serv­ ing exclusively the spontaneous struggle of the proletariat may remain satisfied with merely local agitation and “pure and simple” labour literature.
We do not regard Social-Democracy in this way; we regard it as a revolutionary party, inseparably linked up with the labour movement and directed against ab­ solutism.
Only when organised in such a party' will the pro­ letariat—the most revolutionary class in modem Russia—be in a position to fulfil the historical task that confronts it, namely, to unite under its banner all the democratic elements in the country and to crown the stubborn fight waged by a number of generations that have perished in the past with the final triumph over the hated regime.
« * » The size of the newspaper will range from one to two printed signatures.

We have been promised contributions by a number of prom­ inent representatives of international Social-Democracy, the close co-operation of the Emancipation of Labour group (G.

THE URGENT TASKS OF OUR MOVEMENT1 Russian Social-Democracy has more than once declared that the immediate political tasks of a Russian labour party should be to overthrow the autocracy and to secure political liberty.
This was declared more than fifteen years ago by the repre­ sentatives of Russian Social-Democracy—the members of the Emancipation of Labour group.
Lt was declared two and a half years ago by the representatives of the Russian Social-Democratic organisations, which in the spring of 1898 founded the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.
In spite of re­ peated declarations, however, the question of the political tasks of Social-Democracy in Russia is now again coming to the fore.
Many representatives of our movement express doubt as to the efficacy of the above-mentioned solution of the problem.
It is claimed that the economic struggle is of predominant import­ ance; the political tasks of the proletariat are placed in the background, narrowed down and restricted.
It is even stated that the talk about forming an independent labour party in Russia is merely an imitation of others, that the workers ought to con­ duct only the economic struggle and leave politics to the in­ telligentsia in alliance with the liberals.
The latest confession of faith (the notorious Credo), recently published, amounts practically to a declaration that the Russian proletariat is still a minor, and to a complete rejection of the Social-Demo­ cratic programme.
Rabochaya Mysl (more particularly in its Special Supplement) takes practically the same attitude.
Rus­ sian Social-Democracy is passing through a period of vacilla­ tion and doubt which amounts to self-negation.
On the one hand, the labour movement is being torn away from socialism.

—Ed.
9 9 the workers are being helped to earn* on the economic struggle, but nothing is done to explain to them the socialist aims and the political tasks of the movement as a whole.
On the other hand, socialism is being torn away from the labour movement; once again Russian Socialists are beginning to talk more and more about the fight against the government having to be car­ ried on entirely by the intelligentsia, because the workers are confining themselves only to the economic struggle.
In our opinion, three circumstances have prepared the ground for this sad state of affairs.
First, in the beginning of their activity, Russian Social-Democrats restricted themselves merely to work in propaganda circles.
When we took up the work of agitation among the masses we were not always able to restrain ourselves from going to the other extreme.
Secondly, in die beginning of our activity we often had to fight for our right of existence against the Narodovolists,1 who by ‘‘politics” under­ stood activity isolated from the labour movement and who re­ duced politics exclusively to struggle by means of conspiracies.
In rejecting this sort of politics, the Social-Democrats went to the extreme of pushing politics entirely into the background.
Thirdly, in working isolatedly.
in small, local workers’ circles, the Social-Democrats did not devote sufficient attention to or­ ganising a revolutionary part)' which would combine all the activities of the local groups and make it possible to organise the revolutionary work on proper lines.
The predominance of isolated work is naturally connected with the predominance of the economic struggle.
The above-mentioned circumstances caused all attention to be concentrated upon one ride of the movement only.
The “Econ­ omist” tendency (that is, if we can speak of it as a “tendency”) has attempted to elevate this one-si dedness to a theory, and has tried to utilise for this purpose the now fashionable Bernsteinism, and fashionable “criticism of Marxism.
” which is introducing old bourgeois ideas under a new flag.
These attempts alone have given rise to the danger of the weakening of the connection 1 People’s Will Party, early Russian Socialists who fought against tsarism by means of terrorism.
—Ed, Eng.
ed.
between the Russian labour movement and Russian Social-Dem­ ocracy, which is the vanguard in the struggle for political lib­ erty.
The most urgent task of our movement is to strengthen this connection.
Social-Democracy is a combination of the labour movement with socialism.
Its task is not passively to serve the labour movement at each of its separate stages, but to rep resent the interests of the movement as a whole, to point out to this move-Xnent its ultimate aims and its political tasks, and to protect its political and ideological independence.
Isolated from Social-Democracy, the labour movement becomes petty and inevitably becomes bourgeois: in conducting only the economic struggle, the working class loses its political independence; it becomes the tail of other parties and runs counter to the great slogan: "The emancipation of the workers must be the task of the workers themselves.
” In every country there has been a period in which the labour movement existed separately from the socialist movement, each going its ow*n road; and in every country this state of isolation weakened both the socialist move­ ment and the labour movement Only the combination of social­ ism with the labour movement in each country created a dur­ able basis for both the one and the other.
But in each country this combination of socialism with the labour movement took place historically, was brought about in a special way, in ac­ cordance with the conditions prevailing at the time in each country.
In Russia, the necessity for combining socialism with the labour movement was proclaimed in theory long ago but it is only now being put into practice.
The process of com­ bining the two movements is an extremely difficult one, and there is therefore nothing surprising in the fact that it is ac­ companied by vacillations and doubts.
What lesson should we learn from the past? The whole history of Russian socialism has so brought it about that the most urgent task of the day is to fighit against the autocratic government to win political liberty.
Our social­ ist movement has concentrated, so to speak, on the struggle against the autocracy.
On the other hand, history has shown that the isolation of socialist thought from the advanced re­ presentatives of the working classes is greater in Russia than in other countries, and that as long as this isolation continues the revolutionary movement in Russia is doomed to impotence.
From this automatically emerges the task which Russian Social-Dem­ ocracy is destined to fulfil: to imbue the masses of the proletar­ iat with the ideas of socialism and with political consciousness, and to organise a revolutionary party closely connected with the spontaneous labour movement Russian Social-Democracy has already done much in this direction, but much more still re­ mains to be done.
With the growth of the movement the field of activity for Social-Democrats is becoming much wider; the work is becoming more varied, an increasing number of Party workers are concentrating their efforts upon the fulfillment of various special tasks which the daily needs of propaganda and agitation bring to the fore.
This circumstance is absolutely legitimate and inevitable, but efforts must be exerted to prevent these special activities and special methods in the struggle from becoming ends in themselves and to prevent preparatory work from being raised to the level of the main and sole work.
To assist the political development and the political organ­ isation of the working class is our principal and fundamental task.
Those who push this task into die background, who refuse to subordinate to it all the special tasks and mediods of the struggle, are straying onto the wrong path and are causing seri­ ous harm to the movement.
And this task is pushed into the back­ ground, first, by those who call revolutionaries to the struggle against the government through the medium of circles of con­ spirators isolated from the labour movement and, secondly, by those who restrict the content and scope of political propaganda, agitation and organisation, who think the workers ought to be treated to politics only in exceptional moments of their lives, only on festive occasions, those who so sedulously substitute for the political struggle against the autocracy demands for partial con­ cessions from the autocracy, and are little concerned with raising the demand for separate concessions into a systematic and de­ termined struggle of the revolutionary party against the autocracy.
"Organise!” is the appeal Rabochaya My si repeats to the workers in a thousand different sharps and flats, and this appeal is taken up by all the adherents of the Economist tendency.
We.
of course, wholly endorse this appeal but we unconditionally add to it: organise, not only in benefit societies, strike funds and workers’ circles, but organise also in a political party, organise for the determined struggle against the autocratic government, and against the whole of capitalist society.
Unless the proletariat organises in this way, it will never rise to the Iveights of class conscious struggle; unless the workers organ­ ise in this way, the labour movement is doomed to impotence.
.
Merely with the aid of funds and circles and benefit societies, the working class will never ta able to fulfil its great historic mission: to emancipate itself and the whole of the Russian people from political and economic slavery.
Not a single class in history has achieved power without producing its political leaders, its prominent representatives able to organise a move­ ment and lead it.
And the Russian working class has already shown that it can produce such men: the struggle which has de­ veloped so widely during the past five or six years has revealed the great potential revolutionary power of the working class; it has shown that the most ruthless government persecution does not diminish but.
on the contrary, increases the number of workers who strive towards socialism, towards political con­ sciousness and towards the political struggle.
The congress which our comrades held in 1898 quite correctly defined our tasks and did not merely repeat other people’s words, did not merely express the “enthusiasm” of the “intelligentsia.
” We must set to work resolutely to fulfil these tasks, we must raise the ques­ tion of defining the programme, organisation and tactics of the Party.
We have already explained our views on the fundamental postulates of our programme and, of course, this is not the place to develop them in detail.
We propose to devote a series of articles in ensuing numbers to questions of organisation.
This is one of the sorest questions confronting us.
In this respect, we lag considerably behind the old workers in the Rus­ sian revolutionary movement.
We must frankly admit this de­ feet, and exert all ouir efforts to dievise methods of greater secrecy in our work, to conduct systematic propaganda explain­ ing the proper methods of conducting the work, proper methods of deceiving the gendarmes and of avoiding the snares of the police.
We must train people who will devote to the revolu­ tion not only their spare evenings, but the whole of their lives; we must build up an organisation large enough to be able to introduce strict division of labour in the various forms of our work.
Finally, with regard to the question of tactics, we intend to confine ourselves here to the following: Social-Democracy does not tie its hands, it does not restrict its activities to some preconceived plan or method of political struggle; it recognises all methods of struggle, as long as they correspond to the forces at the disposal of the Party and facilitate the achievement of the greatest results possible under the given conditions.
If we have a strongly organised party, a single strike may grow into a political demonstration, into a political victory over the government.
If we have a strongly organised party, a rebellion in a single locality may flare up into a victorious revolution.
We must bear in mind that the fight against the government for certain demands, the gain of certain concessions, are merely slight skirmishes with the enemy, slight skirmishes of outposts, but that the decisive battle still lies ahead.
Before us, in all its strength, towers the fortress of the enemy from which a hail of shells and bullets pours down upon us, mowing down our best warriors.
We must capture this fortress, and we shall capture it if we combine all the forces of the awakening proletariat with all the forces of the Russian rev­ olutionaries irtfo a single party that will attract all that is virile and honest in Russia.
Only then will be fulfilled the prophecy of die great Russian worker-revolutionary, Peter Alexeyev: “The muscular arms of millions of workers will be raised, and the yoke of despotism, that is guarded by soldiers* bayonets, will be smashed to atoms!” December 1900.
WHERE TO BEGIN? The question “what is to be done?” has been very prominent before the Russian Social-Democrats in the past few years.
It is not a matter of choosing the path we are to travel (as was the case at the end of the ’eighties and the beginning of the ’nineties), but of the practical measures and the methods we must adopt on a certain path.
What we have in mind is a system and plan of practical activity.
It must be confessed that the question of the character of the struggle and die means by which it is to be carried on—which is a fundamental ques­ tion for a practical party—still remains unsettled and still gives rise to serious differences which reveal a deplorable un­ certainty and ideological wavering.
On the one hand, the “Econ­ omist” tendency, which strives to curtail and restrict the work of political organisation and agitation, is not dead yet by any means.
On the other hand, the tendency of unprincipled eclec­ ticism, masquerading in the guise of every new “idea” and in­ capable of distinguishing between the requirements of the mo­ ment and the permanent needs of the movement as a whole, still proudly raises its head.
As is well known, such a tendency has entrenched itself in Rabocheye Dyelo.
The latest statement of “principles” published by that paper—a sensational article bearing the bombastic title, “A Historical Turn”* (Listok Rabochevo Dyela, No.
6)—strongly confirms our opinion of it.
Only yesterday, we flirted with Economism, expressed our in­ dignation at the severe condemnation of Rabochaya My si.
and “modified” the Plekhanov presentation of the question of fight­ ing against the autocracy; but today we quote the words of Lieb­ knecht: “If circumstances change within twenty-four hours then tactics must be changed within twenty-four hours”; now we talk about a “strong fighting organisation” for the direct attack upon 15 and storming of the autocracy; about “extensive revolutionary, political [how strongly this is worded: revolutionary and polit­ ical!] agitation among the masses”; about “unceasing calls for street protests”; about “organising street demonstrations of a sharply [sic/] expressed political character,” etc.
, etc.
We might have expressed satisfaction at Rabocheye Dyelo having so readily understood the programme we advocated in the very first number of Iskra.
viz.
, establishing a strongly organised party for the purpose of winning, not only a few concessions, but the very fortress of the autocracy; but the ab­ sence of anything like a fixed point of view in Rabocheye Dyelo spoils all our pleasure.
Rabocheye Dyelo takes Liebknecht's name in vain, of course.
Tactics in carrying on agitation on some special question, or in relation to some detail of Party organisation, may be changed within twenty-four hours; but views as to whether a militant organisation and political agitation among the masses are neces­ sary, necessary at all times and absolutely necessary, cannot be changed in twenty-four hours, or even in twenty-four months for that matter—except by those who have no fixed ideas on anything.
It is absurd to refer to changed circumstances and changing periods.
Work for the establishment of a fighting organisation and for carrying on political agitation must be carried on under all circumstances, no matter how “drab and peaceful” the times may be, and no matter how low the “de­ pression of revolutionary spirit” has sunk.
More than that, it is precisely in such conditions and in such periods that this work is particularly required; for it would be too late to start building such an organisation in the midst of uprisings and outbreaks.
The organisation must be ready to develop its activ­ ity at any moment.
“Change tactics in twenty-four hours!” In order to change tactics it is necessary first of all to have tac­ tics, and without a strong organisation, tested in the political struggle carried on under all circumstances and in all periods, there can be no talk of a systematic plan of activity, enlightened by firm principles and unswervingly carried out, which alone is worthy of being called tactics.
Think of it! We are now told that the ‘"historical moment” has confronted our Party with the “absolutely new” question of—terror!* Yesterday the “absolute­ ly new” question was the question of political organisation and agitation; today it is the question of terror! Does it not sound strange to hear people with such short memories arguing about radical changes in tactics? Fortunately, Rabocheye Dyelo is wrong.
The question of ter­ ror is certainly not a new one, and it will be sufficient briefly to recall the long-established views of Russian Social-Democracy on this question to prove it.
We have never rejected terror on principle, nor can we do so.
Terror is a form of military operation that may be usefully applied, or may even be essential in certain moments of the battle, under certain conditions, and when the troops are in a certain condition.
The point is, however, that terror is now advocated, not as one of the operations the army in the field must carry out in close connection and in complete harmony with the whole system of fighting, but as an individual attack, completely separated from any army whatever.
In view of the absence of a central revolutionary organisation, terror cannot be anything but that.
That is why we declare that under pres­ ent circumstances such a method of fighting is inopportune and inexpedient; it will distract the most active fighters from their present tasks, which are more important from the standpoint of the interests of the whole movement, and will disrupt, not the government forces, but the revolutionary forces.
Recall recent events.
** Before our very eyes, broad masses of the urban workers and the urban “common people” rushed into battle, but the revolutionaries lacked a staff of leaders and organisers.
Would not the departure of the most energetic revolutionaries to take up the work of terror under circumstances like these weaken die fighting detachments upon which alone serious hopes can be placed? Would it not threaten to break the contacts that exist between the revolutionary organisations and the disunited, discontented masses, who are expressing protest, and who are ready for the fight, but who are weak simply because they are disunited? And these contacts are the only guarantee of our 2 Lenin ll success.
We would not for one moment assent that individual strokes of heroism are of no importance al all.
But it is our duty to utter a strong warning against devoting all attention to terror, against regarding it as the principal method of strug­ gle, as so many at the present time are inclined to do.
Terror can never become the regular means of warfare; at best, it can only be of use as one of the methods of a final onslaught.
The question is, can we, at the present time, issue the call to storm the fortress? Apparently Rabocheye Dyelo thinks we can.
At all events, it exclaims: “Form into storming columns!” But this is merely a display of excessive zeal.
Our military forces mainly consist of volunteers and rebels.
We have only a few detachments of regular troops, and even these are not mobil­ ised, not linked up with each other, and not trained to form into any kind of military column, let alone a storming column.
Under such circumstances, anyone capable of taking a general view of the conditions of our struggle, without losing sight of them at every “turn” in the historical progress of events, must clearly understand that at the present time our slogan cannot be “Storm the fortress,” but should be “Organise properly the siege of the enemy fortress.
” In other words, the immediate task of our Party is not to call up our available forces for an im­ mediate attack, but to call for the establishment of a revolution­ ary organisation capable of combining all the forces and of leading the movement not only in name but in deed, i.
e.
, an organisation that will be ready at any moment to support every protest and every outbreak, and to utilise these for the purpose of increasing and strengthening the military forces fit for the decisive battle.
The events of February and March have taught us such a thorough lesson that it is hardly likely that objection will be raised to the above conclusion on principle.
But we are not called upon at the present moment to settle the question in principle, but in practice.
We must not only be clear in our minds as to the kind of organisation we must have and the kind of work we must do; we must also draw up a definite plan of organisation that will enable us to set to work to build it from all sides.
In view of the urgency and importance of the ques­ tion, we have taken it upon ourselves to submit to our com­ rades die outlines of such a plan, which is described in greater detail in a pamphlet now in preparation for the press.
In our opinion, the starling point of all our activities, the first practical step towards ci eating the organisation we desire, the thread that will guide us in unswervingly developing, deep­ ening and expanding that organisation, is the establishment of an ail-Russian political newspaper'.
A paper is what we need above all; without it we camiot systematically carry on that extensive and theoretically sound propaganda and agitation which is the principal and constant duly of the Social-Demo­ crats in general, and the essential task of the present moment in particular, when interest in politics and in questions of so­ cialism has been aroused among the widest sections of die population.
Never before has the need been so strongly felt for supplementing individual agitation in the form of personal in­ fluence, local lealiets, pamphlets, etc.
, with general and re­ gularly conducted agitation, such as can be carried on only with die assistance of a periodical press.
It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the frequency and regularity of publication (and distribution) of the paper would serve as an exact measure of the extent to which that primary and most essential branch of our military activities has been firmly estab­ lished.
Moreover, tlie paper must be an all-Kussian paper.
Unless we are able to exercise united influence upon the popula­ tion and upon the government with the aid of the printed word, it will be utopian to think of combining other more complex, difficult, but more determined forms of exercising influence.
Our movement, intellectually as well as practically and organisation­ ally, suffers most of all from being scattered, from the fact dial the vast majority of Social-Democrats are almost entirely im­ mersed in purely local work, which narrows their horizon, limits their activities and affects their conspiratorial skill and train­ ing.
It is in this state of disintegration that we must seek the deepest roots of the instability and vacillation to which I re­ ferred above.
The first step towards removing this defect, and 2* transforming several local movements into a united all-Russian movement, is the establishment of a national all-Russian news­ paper.
Finally, it is a political paper we need.
Without a polit­ ical organ, a political movement deserving that name is incon­ ceivable in modern Europe.
Without such a paper it will be absolutely impassible -to fulfil our task, namely, to concentrate all the elements of political discontent and protest, and with them fertilize the revolutionary movement of the proletariat.
The first step we have already accomplished.
We have aroused in the working class a passion for “economic,” factory ex­ posures.
We have now to take the second step: to arouse in every section of the population that is at all enlightened a pas­ sion for political exposures.
We must not allow ourselves to be discouraged by the fact that the voice of political exposure is still feeble, rare and timid.
This is not because of a general submission to political despotism, but because those who are able and ready to expose have no tribune from which to speak, because there is no audience to listen eagerly to, and approve of, what the orators say, and because the latter do not see any­ where among the people forces to whom it would be worth while directing their complaint against the “omnipotent” Rus­ sian government.
But now all this is changing with enormous rapidity.
Such a force now exists—the revolutionary proletariat It has demonstrated its readiness, not only to listen to and to support an appeal for a political struggle, but to fight boldly in that struggle.
We are now in a position, and it is our duty, to set up a tribune for the national exposure of the tsarist gov­ ernment.
That tribune must be a Social-Democratic paper.
The Russian working class, unlike other classes and strata of Rus­ sian society, betrays a constant desire for political knowledge; it demands illegal literature, not only during periods of un­ usual unrest, but at all times.
Given that mass demand, given the training of experienced revolutionary leaders which has already begun, and given the great concentration of the work­ ing class, which makes it the real master in the working class quarters of large towns, in factory settlements and small in­ dustrial towns, the establishment of a political paper is a thing quite within the powers of the proletariat Through the medium of the proletariat, the paper will penetrate to the urban petty bourgeoisie and to the village handicraftsmen and peasants, and । will thus become a real, popular political paper.
But the role of a paper is not confined solely to the spread­ ing of ideas, to political education and to attracting political allies.
A paper is not merely a collective propagandist and col­ lective agitator, it is also a collective organiser.
In this respect, it can be compared to the scaffolding erected around a building in construction; it marks the contours of the structure and facilitates communication between the builders, permitting them to distribute the work and to view the common results achieved by their organised labour.
With the aid of, and around, a paper, there will automatically develop an organisation that will en­ gage, not only in local activities, but also in regular, general work; it will teach its members carefully to watch political events, to estimate their importance and their influence on the various sections of the population, and to devise suitable meth­ ods of influencing these events through the revolutionary party.
The mere technical problem of procuring a regular supply of material for the newspaper and its regular distribution will make it necessary to create a network of agents of a united party, who will be in close contact with each other, will be acquainted with the general situation, will be accustomed to ful­ filling the detailed functions of the national (all-Russian) work, and Who will test their strength in the organisation of various kinds of revolutionary activities.
This network of agents1 will form the skeleton of the organisation we need, namely, one that is sufficiently large to embrace the whole country; sufficicnt-1 It is understood, of course, that these agents can act successfully only if they work in close conjunction with the local committees (groups or circles) of our Party.
Indeed, the whole plan we have sketched can he curried out only with the most active support of the committees, which have already made more than one attempt to achieve a united party, and which, I am certain, sooner or later, and in one form or another, will (ichieve that unity.
ly wide and many-sided to effect a strict and detailed division of labour; sufficiently tried and tempered unswervingly to carry out its own work under all circumstances, at all “turns” and in unexpected contingencies; sufficiently flexible to be able to avoid open battle against the overwhelming and concentrated forces of the enemy, and yet able to take advantage of the clum­ siness of the enemy and aittack him at a time and place where he least expects attack.
Today we are faced with the com­ paratively simple task of supporting students demonstrating in the streets of large towns; tomorrow, perhaps, we shall be faced with a more difficult task, as for instance, supporting a move­ ment of the unemployed in some locality or other.
The day after tomorrow, perhaps, we may have to be ready at our posts, to take a revolutionary part in some peasants’ revolt.
Today we must take advantage of the strained political situation created by the government’s attack upon the Zemstvo.
Tomorrow, we may have to support the indignation of the population against the outbreaks of some tsarist bashi-bazuk.
and help, by boycott, agitation, demonstration, etc.
, to teach him such a lesson as will compel him to beat an open retreat.
This degree of military preparedness can be created only by the constant activity of a regular anny.
If we unite our forces for conducting a common paper, that work will prepare and bring forward, not only the most competent propagandists, but also the most skilled organ­ isers and the most talented political Partv leaders, who will be able at the right moment to issue the call for the decisive battle, and will be capable of leading that battle.
In conclusion, we desire to say a few words in order to avoid possible misunderstandings.
We have spoken continually about systematic and methodical preparation, but we had no desire in the least to suggest that the autocracy may fall only as a result of a properly prepared siege or organised attack.
Such a view would be stupid and doctrinaire.
On the contrary, it is quite possible, and historically far more probable, that the autocracy will fall under the pressure of one of those sponta­ neous outbursts or unforeseen political complications which con-stanlly tin eaten it from all sides.
But no political party, if it desires to avoid adventurist tactics, can base its activities on expectations of such outbursts and complications.
We must pro­ ceed along our road and steadily carry out our systematic work, and the less we rely on the unexpected, the less likely are we to be taken by surprise by a “historical turn.

” (From a letter by Lassalle to Marx, dated June 24, 1352) WHAT IS TO BE DONE?1 PREFACE According to the author’s original plan, the present pamphlet was intended for the purpose of developing in greater detail the ideas that were expressed in the article “Where to Begin?”2 (Iskra, No.
4, May 1901.
) First of all, we must apologise to the reader for this belated fulfilment of the promise made in that article (and repeated in reply to many private enquiries and letters).
One of the reasons for this belatedness was the attempt to combine all the Social-Democratic organisations abroad, which was undertaken in June last (1901).
* Natural­ ly, one wanted to wait and see the results of this attempt, for had it been successful it would perhaps have been neces­ sary to explain Iskra's views on organisation from another point of view.
In any case, such success promised to put an end very quickly to the existence of two separate tendencies in Russian Social-Democracy.
As the reader knows, the attempt failed, and, as we shall try to show further on, failure was inevitable after the new turn Rabocheye Dyelo took, in its issue No.
10, towards Economism.
It was found to be absolutely necessary to commence a determined fight against this diffused, ill-defined, but very persistent tendency, which could have sprung up in many diverse forms.
Accordingly, the original plan of the pamphlet was changed and considerably enlarged.
Its main theme wras to have been the three questions presented in the article, “Where to Begin?,” viz.
, the character and the principal content of our political agitation, our organisational tasks, and the plan for setting up, simultaneously, and from xThe pamphlet JFhat h To Be Done? is given in this volume in the text as revised by the author for the 1908 edition.

all sides, a militant, all-Russian organisation.
These ques­ tions have long engaged the mind of the author, and he tried to raise them in Rabochaya Gazcta at the time one of the unsuccessful attempts was made to revive that paper.
(C/.
chap.
V.
) But the original plan to confine this pamphlet to these three questions and to express our views as far as possible hi a positive form without or almost without entering into polemics proved quite impracticable for two reasons.
One was that Economism proved to be more virile than we had supposed (we employ the term Economism in the broad sense as it was explained in Iskra, No.
12, December 1901, in an article en­ titled “A Conversation with Defenders of Economism,” which was a synopsis, as it were, of the present pamphlet).
It became unquestionably clear that the differences regarding the solution of the three problems mentioned were to be ex­ plained to a much greater degree by the fundamental antagon­ ism between the two tendencies in Russian Social-Democracy than by differences over details.
The second reason was that the astonishment displayed by the Economists concerning the views we expressed in Iskra revealed quite clearly that we often speak in different tongues, and therefore cannot come to any under­ standing without going over the whole argument ab ovo1; that it was necessary to attempt in the simplest possible style, il­ lustrated by numerous and concrete examples, systematically “to clear up" all the fundamental points of difference with all die Economists.
I resolved to make this attempt to “clear up” these paints, fully realising that it would greatly increase the size of the pamphlet and delay its publication, but I saw no other way of fulfilling the promise I made in the article “Where to Begin?” In apologising for the belated publication of the pamphlet, I also must apologise for its numerous literary short­ comings.
I had to work under great pressure, and frequently had to interrupt the writing of it for other work.
The examination of the three questions mentioned above still comprises the main theme of this pamphlet, but I had to start out with the examination of two other, more general questions, 1 Literally ufrom the egg”; from the beginning.
—Ed, viz.
, why is aii “innocent” and “natural” slogan like “free­ dom of criticism” a genuine fighting watchword for us? And why can we not agree on even so important a ques­ tion as the role of Social-Democracy in relation to the spontaneous mass movement? Furthermore, the exposition of our views on the character and the content of political agitation developed into an explanation of the difference between trade union politics and Social-Democratic politics, and the exposi­ tion of our views on organisational tasks developed into an ex­ planation of the difference between primitive methods, which satisfy the Economists, and an organisation of revolutionaries, which in our opinion is essential.
Moreover, I insist on the “plan” for a national political newspaper, the more so because of the weakness of the arguments that were levelled against it, and because the question that I put in the article “Where to Be­ gin?” as to how we can set to work simultaneously, from all sides, to establish the organisation we require was never really answered.
Finally, in the concluding part of this pamphlet I hope to prove that we did all we could to avoid a decisive rupture with the Economists, but ithat the rupture proved in­ evitable; that Rabocheye Dyelo acquired special, “historical,” if you will, significance not so much because it expressed con­ sistent Economism, but because it fully and strikingly expressed the confusion and vacillation that mark a whole period in the history of Russian Social-Democracy, and that, therefore, the polemics with Rabocheye Dyelo, which at first sight may seem excessively detailed, also acquire significance; for we can make no progress until we have completely liquidated this period.

I DOGMATISM AND “FREEDOM OF CRITICISM’* A.
What is “Freedom of Criticism”? “Freedom of criticism,” this undoubtedly is the most fashion­ able slogan at the present time, and the one most frequently employed in the controversies between the Socialists and demo­ crats of all countries.
At first sight, no tiling would appear to be more strange than the solemn appeals by one of the parties to the dispute for freedom of criticism.
Can it be that some of the advanced parties have raised their voices against the con­ stitutional law of the majority of European countries which guarantees freedom to science and scientific investigation? “Something must be wrong here,” an onlooker, who has not yet fully appreciated the nature of the disagreements among the controversialists, will say when he hears tliis fashionable slogan repeated at every cross-road.
“Evidently this slogan is one of the conventional phrases which, like a nickname, becomes leg-itimatised by use, and becomes almost a common noun,” he will conclude.
In fact, it is no secret that two separate tendencies have been formed in international Social-Democracy.
1 The fight between 1 Incidentally, this perhaps is the only occasion in the history of modern socialism in which controversies between various tendencies within the socialist movement have grown from national into international contro­ versies; and this is extremely encouraging.
Formerly, the disputes between the LasaUeans and tie Eisenachers.
between the Guesdists and the Pos-sibilists, between the Fabians and the Social-Democrats, and between the Narodovolists and the Social-Democrats, remained purely national disputes, reflected purely national features and proceeded, as it were, on different planes.
Al the present time (this is quite evident now), the English Fabi­ ans, the French Ministerialists, the German Bernstcinists (revisionists— Ed.
), and the Russian “critics”—all belong to the same family, all extol each ether, learn from each other, and are rallying their forces against 30 these tendencies now flares up in a bright flame, and now dies down and smoulders under the ashes of imposing “resolutions for an armistice.
” What this “new” tendency, which adopts a “critical” altitude towards “obsolete doctrinaire” Marxism, re­ presents has been stated with sufficient precision by Bernstein, and demonstrated by Millerand.
** SociabDemocracy must change from a party of the social revolution into a democratic parly of social reforms.
Bernstein has surrounded this political demand with a whole battery of symmetrically arranged “new” arguments and reasonings.
The possibility of putting socialism on a scientific basis and of prov­ ing that it is necessary and inevitable from the point of view of the materialist conception of history was denied, as also were the facts of growing impoverishment and proletarianisation and the intensification of capitalist contradictions.
Tlie very concep­ tion, “ultimate aim," was declared to lie unsound, and the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat was absolutely rejected.
It was denied that there is any difference in principle between liberalism and socialism.
The theory of the class struggle was rejected on the grounds that it could not be applied to a strictly democratic society, governed according to the will of the major­ ity, etc.
Thus, the demand for a definite change from revolutionary Social-Democracy to bourgeois social-reformism was accompanied by a no less definite turn towards bourgeois criticism of all the fundamental ideas of Marxism.
As this criticism of Marxism has been going on for a long time now, from the political plat­ form, from university -chairs, in numerous pamphlets and in a number of scientific works, as the younger generation of the educated classes has been systematically trained for decades on this criticism, it is not surprising that the “new, critical” tendency in Social-Democracy should spring up, all complete, like Minerva from the head of Jupiter.
The content of this new “doctrinaire” Marxism.
* Perhaps in this first really international battle with socialist opportunism, international revolutionary Social-Democracy will become sufficiently strengthened to put an end to the political reaction that has long reigned in Europe.
tendency did not have to grow and develop, it was transferred bodily from bourgeois literature to (socialist literature.
To proceed.
If Bernstein’s theoretical criticism and political yearnings are still obscure to anyone, the French have taken the trouble to demonstrate the “new method.
” In this instance, also, France has justified its old reputation as the country in which “more than anywhere else, the historical class struggles were each time fought out to a decision .
.
.
” (Engels, in his intro­ duction to Marx’s The Eighteenth Brumaire.
) The French Social­ ists have begun, not to theorise, but to act.
The more developed democratic political conditions in France have permitted them to put Bernsteinism into practice immediately, with all its con­ sequences.
Millerand has provided an excellent example of practical Bernsteinism; not without reason did Bernstein and Vollmar rush so zealously to defend and praise him! Indeed, if Social-Democracy, in essence, is merely a reformist party, and must be bold enough to admit this openly, then not only has a Socialist the right to join a bourgeois cabinet, it is even his duty always to strive to do so.
If democracy, in essence, means the abolition of class domination, then why should not a Socialist minister charm the whole bourgeois world by orations on class co-operation? Why should he not remain in the cabinet even after the shooting down of workers by gendarmes has exposed, for the hundredth and thousandth time, the real nature of the democratic co-operation of classes? Why should he not person­ ally take part in welcoming the tsar, for whom the French So­ cialists now have no other sobriquet than “Hero of the Knout, Gallows and Banishment” (knottier, pejideur et deportateur) ? And the reward for this utter humiliation and self-degradation of socialism in the face of the whole world, for the corruption of the socialist consciousness of the working class—the only basis that can guarantee our victory—the reward for this is im­ posing plans for niggardly reforms, so niggardly in fact that much more has been obtained from bourgeois governments! He who does not deliberately close his eyes cannot fail to see that the new “critical” tendency in socialism is nothing more nor less than a new species of opportunism.
And if we judge people not by the brilliant uniforms they deck themselves in, not by die imposing appellations they give themselves, but by their actions, and by what they actually advocate, it will be clear that “freedom of criticism” means freedom for an opportunistic tendency in Social-Democracy, the freedom to convert Social-Democracy into a democratic reformist party, the freedom to in­ troduce bourgeois ideas and bourgeois elements into socialism.
“Freedom” is a grand word, but under the banner of free trade the most predatory wars were conducted; under the ban­ ner of free labour, the toilers were robbed.
The modern use of the term “freedom of criticism” contains the same inherent falsehood.
Those who are really convinced that they have ad­ vanced science would demand, not freedom for the new views to continue side by side with -the old, but the substitution of the new views for the old.
The cry “Long live freedom of criticism,” that is heard today, too strongly calls to mind the fable of the empty barrel.
* We are marching in a compact group along a precipitous and difficult path, firmly holding each other by the hand.
We are surrounded on all sides by enemies, and are under their almost constant fire.
We have combined voluntarily, precisely for the purpose of fighting the enemy, and not to retreat into the adja­ cent marsh, the inhabitants of which, from the very outset, have reproached us with having separated ourselves into an exclusive group and with having chosen the path of struggle instead of the path of conciliation.
And now several among us begin to cry out: let us go into this marsh! And when we begin to shame them, they retort: how conservative you are! Are you not ashamed to deny us the right to invite you to take a better road! Oh yes, gentlemen! You are free not only to invite us, hut to go yourselves wherever you will, even into the marsh.
In fact, we think that the mansh is your proper place, and we are prepared to render you every assistance to get there.
Only let go of our hands, don’t clutch at us and don’t besmirch the grand word “freedom”; for we too are “free” to go where we please, free not only to fight against the marsh, but also against those who are turning towards the marsh.

The New Advocates of “Freedom of Criticism” Now, this slogan (“freedom of criticism”) is solemnly ad­ vanced in No.
10 of Rabocheye Dyelo, the organ of the League of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, not as a theoretical postu­ late, but as a political demand, as a reply to the question: “is it possible to unite the Social-Democratic organisations operating abroad?”—“in order that unity may be durable, there must be freedom of criticism.
” (P.
36.
) From this statement two very definite conclusions must be drawn: 1) that Rabocheye Dyelo has taken the opportunist tend­ ency in international Social-Democracy under its wing; and 2) that Rabocheye Dyelo demands freedom for opportunism in Russian Social-Democracy.
We shall examine these conclusions.
Rabocheye Dyelo is “particularly” displeased with Iskra's and Zarya's “inclination to predict a rupture between the Mountain and the Gironde in international Social-Democracy.
” 1 “Generally speaking,” writes Krichevsky, editor of Rabocheye Dyelo, “this talk about the Mountain and the Gironde that is heard in the ranks of Social-Democracy represents a shallow historical analogy, which looks strange when it cumes from the pen of a Marxist.
The Mountain and the Gironde did not represent two different temperaments, or intellectual tend­ encies, as ideologist historians may think, but two different classes or strata—the middle bourgeoisie on the one hand, and the petty bourgeoisie and the proletariat on the other.
In the modern socialist movement, how­ ever, there is no conflict of class interests; the socialist movement in its entirety, all of its diverse forms [B.

] that has secured the rapid spread of Bernsteinism? And what is most important—on what does our author base his opinion that even “the most pronounced Bernsteinists” stand on the basis of the class struggle for the political and economic emancipa­ tion of the proletariat? No one knows.
This determined defence of the most pronounced Bernsteinists is not supported by any kind of argument whatever.
Apparently, the author believes that if he repeats what the pronounced Bernsteinists say about them­ selves, his assertion requires no proof.
But can anything more “shallow” be imagined than an opinion of a whole tendency that is based on nothing more than what the representatives of that tendency say about themselves? Can anything more shallow be imagined than the subsequent “homily” about the two differ­ ent and even diametrically opposite types, or paths, of Party development? (Rabocheye Dyelo, pp.
34-35.
) The German So­ cial-Democrats, you see, recognise complete freedom of criticism, but the French do not, and it is precisely the latter that present an example of the “harmfulness of intolerance.
” To which we reply that the very example B.
Krichevsky quotes proves that those who regard history literally from the Ilovay­ sky* point of view sometimes describe themselves as Marxists.
There is no need whatever, in explaining the unity of the Ger­ man Socialist Party and the dismembered state of the French Socialist Party, to search for the special features in the history of the respective countries, to compare the conditions of mili­ tary semi-absolutism in the one country with republican parlia­ mentarism in the other, or to analyse the effects of the Paris Commune and the effects of the Anti-Social ist Law in Ger­ many**; to compare the economic life and economic develop­ ment of the -two countries, or recall that “the unexampled growth of German Social-Democracy” was accompanied by a strenuous struggle, unexampled in the history of socialism, not only against mistaken theories (Mühlberger, Dühring,1 the So-1 At the time Engels hurled his attack against Diihring, many represent­ atives of German Social-Democracy inclined towards the latter’s views, and accusations of acerbity, intolerance, uncomradely polemics, etc.
, were even publicly hurled at Engels at the Party congress.
At the Congress of 1877, Most, and hia supporters, moved a resolution to prohibit the 3* cialists of the Chair*), but also against mistaken 'tactics (Lassalle), etc.
, etc.
All that is superfluous! The French quarrel among themselves because they are intolerant; the Germans are united because they are good boys.
And observe, this piece of matchless profundity is intended to “refute” the fact which is a complete answer to the defence of Bernsteinism.
The question as to whether the Bemsteinists do stand on the basis of the class struggle of the proletariat can be completely and irrevocably answered only by historical experience.
Consequently, the example of France is the most important one in this respect, because France is the only coun­ try in which the Bemsteinists attempted to stand independently, on their own feet, with the warm approval of their German colleagues (and partly also of the Russian opportunists).

)** The reference to the “intolerance” of the French, apart from its “historical” signi­ ficance (in the Nozdrev sense***), turns out to be merely an attempt to obscure a very unpleasant fact with angry invectives.
But we are not even prepared to make a present of the Ger­ mans to B.
Krichevsky and to the numerous other champions of “freedom of criticism.
” The “most pronounced Bemsteinists” are still tolerated in the ranks of the German Party only be­ cause they submit to the Hanover resolution, which emphatically rejected Bernstein’s “amendments,” and to the Lübeck resolu­ tion, which, notwithstanding the diplomatic terms in which it is couched, contains a direct warning to Bernstein.
**** It is a de­ batable point, from the standpoint of the interests of the German Party, whether diplomacy was appropriate and whether, in this case, a bad peace is better than a good quarrel; in short, publication of Engels’ articles in Vorwärts because “they do not interest the overwhelming majority of the readers,” and Vahlteich declared that the publication of these articles had caused great damage to the Party, that Duhring had also rendered services to Social-Democracy: “We must utilise everyone in the interest of the Party; let the professors en­ gage in polemics if they care to do so, but Vorwärts is not the place in which to conduct them.
” (Vorwärts, No.

) Here wre have another example of the defence of “freedom of criticism,” and it would do our legal critics and illegal opportunists, who love so much to quote examples from the Germans, a deal of good to ponder over it! opinions may differ in regard to the expediency, or not, of the methods employed to reject Bernsteinism, but one cannot fail to see the fact that the German Party did reject Bernsteinism on two occasions.
Therefore, to think that the German example en­ dorses the thesis: “The most pronounced Bernsteinists stand on the basis of the proletarian class struggle, for its economic and political emancipation,” means failing absolutely to understand what is going on before one’s eyes.
More than that.
As we have already observed, Rabocheye Dyelo comes before Russian Social-Democracy, demands “free­ dom of criticism,” and defends Bernsteinism.
Apparently it came to the conclusion that we were unfair to our “critics” and Bernsteinists.
To whom were we unfair, when and how? What was the unfairness? About this not a word.
Rabocheye Dyelo does not name a single Russian critic or Bernsteinist! All that is left for us to do is to make one of two possible suppositions: first, that the unfairly treated party is none other than Raboch-eye Dyelo itself (and that is confirmed by the fact that, in the two articles in No.
10, reference is made only to the insults hurled at Rabocheye Dyelo by Zarya and Iskra).
If that is the case, how is the strange fact to be explained that Raboch­ eye Dyelo, which always vehemently dissociates itself from Bern­ steinism, could not defend itself, without putting in a word on behalf of the “most pronounced Bernsteinists” and of freedom of criticism? The second supposition is that third persons have been treated unfairly.
If the second supposition is correct, then why are these persons not named? We see, therefore, that Rabocheye Dyelo is continuing to play die game of hide-and-seek that it has played (as we shall prove further on) ever since it commenced publication.
And note the first practical application of this greatly extolled “freedom of criticism.
” As a matter of fact, not only has it now been reduced to abstention from all criticism, but also to abstention from ex­ pressing independent views altogether.
The very Rabocheye Dye­ lo which avoids mentioning Russian Bernsteinism as if it were a secret disease (to use Starover’s* apt expression) proposes, for the treatment of this disease, to copy word for word the latest German prescription for the treatment of the German variety of the disease! Instead of freedom of criticism—slavish (worse: monkey-like) imitation! The very same social and polit­ ical content of modern international opportunism reveals itself in a variety of ways according to its national characteristics.
In one country the opportunists long ago came out under a separate flag, while in others they ignored theory and in practice conducted a radical-socialist policy.
In a third country, several members of the revolutionary party have deserted to the camp of opportunism and strive to achieve their aims not by an open struggle for principles and for new tactics, but by gradual, unobserved and, if one may so express it, unpunish­ able corruption of their Party.
In a fourth country again, sim­ ilar deserters employ the same methods in the gloom of political slavery, and with an extremely peculiar combination of “legal” with “illegal” activity, etc.
, etc.
To talk about freedom of critic­ ism and Bernsteinism as a condition for uniting the Russian Social-Democrats, and not to explain how Russian Bernsteinism has manifested itself, and what fruits it has borne, means talk­ ing for the purpose of saying nothing.
We shall try, if only in a few words, to say what Rabocheye Dyelo did not want to say (or perhaps did not even understand).
C.
Criticism in Russia The peculiar position of Russia in regard to the point we are examining is that the very beginning of the spontaneous labour movement on the one hand, and the change of progressive pub­ lic opinion towards Marxism on the other, was marked by the combination of obviously heterogeneous elements under a com­ mon flag for the purpose of fighting the common enemy (obsolete social and political views).
1 We refer to the heyday of “legal Marxism.
” Speaking generally, this was an extremely curious phenomenon that no one in the ’eighties or the begin­ ning of the ’nineties would have believed possible.
In a country ruled by an autocracy, in which the press is completely shackled, and in a period of intense political reaction in which even the 1 A reference to the Narodniki.
—Ed, tiniest outgrowth of political discontent and protest was sup­ pressed, the theory of revolutionary Marxism suddenly forces its way into the censored literature, written in ZEsopian1 language, but understood by the “interested.
” The government had accus­ tomed itself to regarding only the theory of (revolutionary) Narodnaya Volya-ism as dangerous, without observing its in­ ternal evolution, as is usually the case, and rejoicing at the criticism levelled against it no matter from what side it came.
Quite a considerable time elapsed (according to our Russian calculations) before the government realised what had happened and the unwieldy army of censors and gendarmes discovered the new enemy and flung itself upon him.
Meanwhile, Marxian books were published one after another, Marxian journals and newspapers were published, nearly everyone became a Marxist, Marxism was flattered, the Marxists were courted and the book publishers rejoiced at the extraordinary, ready sale of Marxian literature.
It was quite natural, therefore, that among the Marxian novices who were caught in this atmosphere, there should be more than one “author wTho got a swelled head.
.
.
We can now speak calmly of this period as of an event of the past.
It is no secret that the brief period in winch Marxism blossomed on the surface of our literature was called forth by the alliance between people of extreme and of extremely mod­ erate views.
* In point of fact, the latter were bourgeois demo­ crats; and this was the conclusion (so strikingly confirmed by their subsequent “critical” development) that intruded itself on the minds of certain persons even when the “alliance” was still intact.
2 That being the case, does not the responsibility for the subse­ quent “confusion” rest mainly upon the revolutionary Social-Democrats who entered into alliance 'with these future “critics”? This question, together with a reply in the affirmative, is some­ times heard from people with excessively rigid views.
But these 1 /e.

e/L] people are absolutely wrong.
Only those who have no self-reliance can fear to enter into temporary alliances even with unreliable people; not a single political party could exist with­ out entering into such alliances.
The combi nation with the “legal Marxists” was in its way the first really political alliance contracted by Russian Social-Democrats.
Thanks to this alliance, an astonishingly rapid victory was obtained over Narodism, and Marxian ideas (even though in a vulgarised form) became very widespread.
Moreover, the alliance was not concluded altogether without “conditions.
” The proof: the burning by the censor, in 1895, of the Marxian symposium, Materials on the Problem of the Economic Development of Russia.
If the literary agreement with the “legal Marxists” can be compared with a political alli­ ance, then that book can be compared with a political treaty.
The rupture, of course, did not occur because the “allies” proved to be bourgeois democrats.
On die contrary, the repre­ sentatives of the latter tendency were the natural and desirable allies of Social-Democracy in so far as its democratic tasks that were brought to the front .
by the prevailing situation in Russia were concerned.
But an essential condition for such an alliance must be complete liberty for Socialists to reveal to the working class that its interests are diametrically opposed to the interests of the bourgeoisie.
However, the Bernsteinian and “critical” tend­ ency, to which the majority of the “legal Marxists” turned, de­ prived the Socialists of this liberty and corrupted socialist con­ sciousness by vulgarising Marxism, by preaching the toning down of social antagonisms, by declaring the idea of the social revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat to be absurd, by restricting the labour movement and the class struggle to narrowr trade unionism and to a “realistic” struggle for petty, gradual reforms.
This was tantamount to the bourgeois demo­ crat’s denial of socialism’s right to independence and, conse­ quently, of its right to existence; in practice it meant a striving to convert the nascent labour movement into a tail of the lib­ erals.
Naturally, under such circumstances a rupture was necessary.
But the “peculiar” feature of Russia manifested itself in that this rupture simply meant the elimination of the Social-Demo­ crats from the most accessible and widespread “legal” literature.
The “ex-Marxists” who took up the flag of “criticism,” and who obtained almost a monopoly of the “criticism” of Marxism, en­ trenched themselves in this literature.
Catchwords like: “Against orthodoxy” and “Long live freedom of criticism” (now repeated by Rabocheye Dyelo) immediately l>coame the fashion, and the fact that neither the censor nor the gendarmes could resist this fashion is apparent from the publication of three Russian editions of Bennstein’s celebrated book (celebrated in the Hero­ stratus sense) and from the fact that the books by Bornstein, Prokopovich and others were recommended by Zubatov.
* (Iskra, No.

) Upon the Social-Democrats was now imposed a task that was difficult in itself, and made incredibly more difficult by purely external obstacles, viz», the task of fighting against the new tendency.
And this tendency did not confine itself to the sphere of literature.
The turn towards criticism was accompanied by the turn towards Economism that was taken by Social-Democratic practical workers.
The manner in which the contacts and mutual inter-depend­ ence of legal criticism and illegal Economism arose and grew is an interesting subject in itself, and may very well be treated in a special article.
It is sufficient to note here that these contacts undoubtedly existed.
The notoriety deservedly acquired by the Credo was due precisely to the frankness with which it formulated these contacts and laid down the fundamental polit­ ical tendencies of Economism.
viz», let the workers carry on the economic struggle (it would be more correct to say the trade union struggle, because the latter also embraces specifically la­ bour politics), and let the Marxian intelligentsia merge with the liberals for the political “struggle.
” Thus it turned out that trade union work “among the people” meant fulfilling the first part of this task, and legal criticism meant fulfilling the second part.
This statement proved to be such an excellent weapon against Economism that, had there been no Credo, it would have been worth inventing.
The Credo was not invented, but it was published without the consent and perhaps even against the will of its authors.
At all events the present writer, who was partly responsible for drag­ ging this new “programme'’ into the light of day,1 has heard complaints and reproaches to the effect that copies of the resume of their views which was dubbed the Credo were dis­ tributed and even published in the press together with the pro­ test! We refer to this episode because it reveals a very peculiar state of mind among our Economists, viz.
, a fear of publicity.
This is a feature of Economism generally, and not of the authors of the Credo alone.
It was revealed by that most outspoken and honest advocate of Economism, Rabochaya Mysl, and by Raboch-eye Dyelo (which was indignant over the publication of Econ­ omist documents in the Vademecum,*), as well as by the Kiev Committee, which two years ago refused to permit the publica­ tion of its profession de foi? together with a repudiation of it,1 and by many other individual representatives of Economism.
This fear of criticism displayed by the advocates of freedom of criticism cannot be attributed solely to craftiness (although no doubt craftiness has something to do with it: it would be unwise to expose the young and as yet puny movement to the enemies’ attack!).
No, the majority of the Economists quite sincerely disapprove (and by the very nature of Economism they must disapprove) of all theoretical controversies, factional disagreements, of broad political questions, of schemes for or­ ganising revolutionaries, etc.
“Leave all this sort of thing to the exiles abroad!” said a fairly consistent Economist to me one day, and thereby he expressed a very widespread (and purely trade unionist) view: our business, he said, is the labour movement, the labour organisations, here, in our localities; all the rest are 1 * 3 1 Reference is made here to the Protest Signed by the Seventeen against the Credo.

The question now arises: seeing what the peculiar features of Russian “criticism” and Russian Bernsteinism were, what should those who desired to oppose opportunism, in deeds and not merely in words, have done? First of all, they should have made efforts to resume the theoretical work that was only just begun in the period of “legal Marxism,” and that has now again fallen on the shoulders of the illegal workers.
Unless such work is undertaken the successful growth of die movement is impossible.
Secondly, they should have actively combated legal “criticism” that was greatly corrupting people’s minds.
Thirdly, they should have actively counteracted the confusion and vacillation prevailing in practical work, and should have exposed and repudiated every conscious or unconscious attempt to degrade our programme and tactics.
That Rabocheye Dyelo did none of these things is a well-known fact, and further on we shall deal with this well-known fact from various aspects.
At the moment, however, we desire merely to show what a glaring contradiction there is between the demand for “freedom of criticism” and the peculiar features of our native criticism and Russian Economism.
Indeed, glance at the text of the resolution by which the League of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad endorsed the point of view of Raboch-eve Dyelo.
“In the interests of the further ideological development of Social Dem­ ocracy, we recognise the freedom to criticise Social-Democratic theory in Party literature to be absolutely necessary' in so far as this criticism does not run counter to the class and revolutionary character of this theory.
” (Two Congresses, p.
10.
*) And what is the argument behind this resolution? The resolu­ tion “in its first part coincides with the resolution of the Lubeck Parly Congress on Bernstein.
.
.
In the simplicity of their souls the “Leaguers” failed to observe the testimonium pauper-tatis (certificate of poverty) they give themselves by this piece of imitativeness! , .
.
“But .
.
.
in its second part, it restricts freedom of criticism much more than did the Lubeck Party Con­ gress.
” So the league’s resolution was directed against Russian Bern-■steinism? If it was not, then the irefcrence to Lubeck is utterly absurd! But it is not true to say that it “restricts freedom of criticism.
” In passing their Hanover resolution, the Germans, point by point, rejected precisely the amendments proposed by Bernstein, while in their Lübeck resolution they cautioned Bern­ stein personally, and named him in the resolution.
Our “free” imitators, however, do not make a single reference to a single manifestation of Russian “criticism” and Russian Economism and in view of this omission, the bare reference to the class and revolutionary character of the theory leaves exceedingly wide scope for misinterpretation, particularly when the League refuses to identify “so-called Economism” with opportunism.
(Two Congresses.

) But all this en passant.
The important thing to note is that the opportunist attitude towards revolutionary Social-Democrats in Russia is the very opposite of that in Germany.
In Germany, as we know, revolutionary Social-Democrats are in favour of preserving what is: they stand in favour of the old programme and tactics which are universally known, and after many decades of experience have become clear in all their details.
The “critics” desire to introduce changes, and as these critics represent an insignificant minority, and as they are very shy and halting in their revisionist efforts, one can understand the motives of the majority in confining them* selves to the dry rejection of “innovations.
” In Russia, however, it is the critics and Economists who are in favour of preserving what is: the “critics” wish us to continue to regard them as Marxists, and to guarantee them the “freedom of criticism” which they enjoyed to the full (for, as a matter of fact, they never recognised any kind of Party ties,1 and, moreover, we 1 The absence of public Party ties and Party traditions by itself nrnrkq such a cardinal difference between Russia and Germany that it should have warned all sensible Socialists against being blindly imitative.
But here is an example of the lengths to which “freedom of criticism** goes in Russia.
Mr.
Bulgakov, the Russian critic, utters the following reprimand to the Austrian critic, Hertz: “Notwithstanding the independ-never had a generally recognised Party organ which could “re­ strict” freedom of criticism even by giving advice); the Econ­ omists want the revolutionaries to recognise the “competency of the present movement” (Rabocheye Dyelo, No.
10, p.
25), i.
e.
, to recognise the “legitimacy” of what exists; they do not want the “ideologists” to try to “divert” the movement from the path that “is determined by the interaction of material elements and material environment” (Letter published in Iskra, No.
12); they want recognition “for the only struggle that the workers can conduct under present conditions,” which in tiheir opinion is the struggle “which they are actually conducting at the pres­ ent time.
” (Special Supplement to Rabochaya My si, p.
14.
) We revolutionary Social-Democrats, on the contrary, are dis­ satisfied with this worshipping of spontaneity, i.
e.
, worshipping what is “at the present time”; we demand that the tactics that have prevailed in recent years be changed; we declare that “be­ fore we can unite, and in order that we may unite, we must first of all firmly and definitely draw the lines of demarcation.
” (See announcement of the publication of Iskra.
1) In a word, the Germans stand for what is and reject the changes; we demand changes, and reject subservience to and conciliation with what is.
This “little” difference our “free” copyists of German resolu­ tions failed to notice! D.
Engels on the Importance of the Theoretical Struggle “Dogmatism, doctrinairism,” “ossification of 'the Party—the inevitable retribution that follows the violent strait-lacing ot ence of his conclusions.
Hertz, on this point [on co-operative societies] apparently remains tied by the opinions of his party, and although he dis­ agrees with it in details, he dare not reject common principles.
” (Capi­ talism and Agriculture, Vol.

) The subject of a politically en­ slaved state, in which nine hundred and ninety-nine out of a thousand of the population are corrupted to the marrow of their bones by political subservience, and completely lack the conception of Party honour and Patty lies, superciliously reprimands a citizen of a constitutional state for being excessively “tied by the opinion of his party”! Our illegal organ­ isations have nothing else to do, of course, but draw up resolutions about freedom of criticism.

thought,” these are the enemies against which the knightly champions of “freedom of criticism” rise in arms in Rabocheye Dyelo, We are very glad that this question has been brought up and we would propose only to add to it another ques­ tion: Who are to be the judges? Before us lie two publishers’ announcements.
One, The Pro­ gramme of the Periodical Organ of the League of Russian So­ cial-Democrats—Rabocheye Dyelo (Reprint from No.
1 of Ra­ bocheye Dyelo), and the other, The Announcement of the Re­ sumption of Publication by the Emancipation of Labour Group * Both are dated 1899, when the “crisis of Marxism” had long since been discussed.
And what do we find? In the first produc­ tion, we would seek in vain for any manifestation or definite elucidation of the position the new organ intends to occupy on this question.
Of theoretical work and the urgent tasks that now confront it, not a word is said in this programme, nor in the supplements to it that wTere passed by the Third Congress of the League in 1901.
(Two Congresses, pp.
15-18.
) During the whole of this lime, the editorial board of Rabocheye Dyelo ignored theoretical questions, notwithstanding the fact that these ques­ tions were agitating the minds of Social-Democrats in all countries.
The other announcement, on the contrary, first of all points to the diminution of interest in theory observed in recent years, imperatively demands “vigilant attention to the theoretical as­ pect of the revolutionary movement of'the proletariat,” and calls for “ruthless criticism of the Bernsteinian and other anti-revolu-lionary tendencies” in our movement.
The issues of Zarya that have appeared show how this programme was carried out.
Thus we see that high-sounding phrases against the ossifica­ tion of thought, etc.
, conceal carelessness and helplessness in die development of theoretical ideas.
The case of the Russian Social-Democrats strikingly illustrates the fact observed in the whole of Europe (and long ago noted also by the German Marxists) that the notorious freedom of criticism implies, not the substitution of one theory for another, but freedom from any complete and thought-out theory; it implies eclecticism and absence of principle.
Those who are in the least acquainted with the actual state of our movement cannot but see that the spread of Marxism was accompanied by a certain lowering of theoretical standards.
Quite a number of people, with very little, and even totally lacking theoretical training, joined the move­ ment for the sake of its practical significance and its prac­ tical successes.
We can judge, therefore, how tactless Raboclceye Dyelo is when, with an air of invincibility, it quotes the state­ ment of Marx: “A single step of the real movement is more important than a dozen programmes.
” To repeat these words in the epoch of theoretical chaos is like wishing mourn­ ers at a funeral “many happy returns of the day.
” Moreover, these words of Marx are taken from his letter on the Gotha Programme,* in which he sharply condemns the eclecticism in the formulation of principles: If you must combine, Marx wrote to the Party leaders, then enter into agreements to satisfy the practical aims of the movement, but do not haggle over prin­ ciples, do not make “concessions” in theory.
This was Marx’s idea, and yet there are people among us who strive—in his name!—to belittle the significance of theory.
Without a revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement.
This cannot be insisted upon too strongly at a lime when the fashionable preaching of opportunism is combined with absorption in the narrowest forms of practical activity.
The importance of theory for Russian Social-Democrats is still greater for three reasons, which are often forgotten: The first is that our Party is only in the process of formation, its features are but just becoming outlined, and it has not yet completely settled its accounts with other tendencies in revolu­ tionary thought which threaten to divert the movement from the proper path.
Indeed, in very recent times we have observed (as Axelrod long ago warned the Economists would happen) a revival of non-Social-Democratic revolutionary tendencies.
Under such circumstances, what at first sight appears to be an “un­ important” mistake may give rise to most deplorable consequen­ ces, and only the short-sighted would consider factional disputes and strict distinction of shades to be inopportune and super­ fluous.
The fate of Russian Soci air Democracy for many, many years to come may be determined by the strengthening of one or the other “shade.
” The second reason is that the Social-Democratic movement is essentially an international movement.
This does not merely mean that we must combat national chauvinism.
It also means that a movement that is starting in a young country can be suc­ cessful only on the condition that it assimilates the experience of other countries.
In order to assimilate this experience, it is not sufficient merely to be acquainted with it, or simply to transcribe the latest resolutions.
A critical attitude is required towards this experience, and ability to subject it to independent tests.
Only those who realise how much the modern labour movement has grown in strength will understand what a reserve of theoretical forces and political (as well as revolutionary) experience is required to fulfil this task.
The third reason is that the national tasks of Russian Social-Democracy are such as have never confronted any other socialist party in the world.
Further on we shall deal with the political and organisational duties which the task of emancipating the whole people from the yoke of autocracy imposes upon us.
At the moment, we merely wish to state that the role of vanguard can be fulfilled only by a party that is guided by an advanced theory.
To understand what this means concretely, let the read­ er call to mind the predecessors of Russian Social-Democracy like Herzen, Belinsky, Chernyshevsky and the brilliant band of revolutionaries of the ’seventies; let him ponder over the world significance which Russian literature is now acquiring; let him .
.
.
Oh! But that is enough! Let us quote what Engels said in 1874 concerning the signifi­ cance of theory in the Social-Democratic movement.
Engels re­ cognises not two forms of the great struggle Social-Democracy is conducting (political and economic), as is the fashion among us, but three, adding to the first two the theoretical strug­ gle.
His recommendations to the German labour movement, which had become practically and politically strong, are so in­ structive from the point of view of present-day controversies that we hope the reader will forgive us for quoting a long passage from his Introduction to 77u? Peasant War in Germany, which long ago became a literary rarity.
“The German workers have two important advantages over those of the rest of Europe.
First, they belong to the most theoretical people of Europe; they have retained that sense of theory which the so-called ‘educated’ people of Germany have totally lost.
Without German philosophy which preceded it, particularly that of Hegel, German scicntilic socialism (the only scientific socialism that has ever existed) would never have come into existence.
Without a sense of theory among the workers, this scientific socialism would never have become part of their flesh and blood as it has.
What an immeasurable advantage this is may be seen, on the one hand, from the indifference of the English labour movement towards all theory, which is one of the chief reasons why it moves so slowly, in spite of the splendid organisation of the individual unions; on the other hand, from the mischief and confusion wrought by Proudhonism, in its original form among the French and Belgians, and in the further carica­ tured form at the hands of Bakunin, among the Spaniards and Italians.
“The second advantage is that, chronologically speaking, the Germans were almost the last to appear in the labour movement.
Just as German theoretical socialism will never forget that it rests on the shoulders of Saint-Simon, Fourier and Owen, tnrec men who, in spite of all their phantastic notions and utopianism, have their place among the most emi­ nent thinkers of all time, and whose genius anticipated innumerable truths the correctness of which can now be scientifically proved, so the practical German labour movement must never forget that it has developed on the shoulders of the English and French movements, that it was able simply to utilise their dearly-bought experience, and could now avoid their mis­ takes which in their time were mostly unavoidable.
Without the English trade unions and the French workers’ political struggle which came before, without the gigantic impulse given especially by the Paris Com­ mune, where would we now be? “It must be said to the credit of the German workers that they exploited the advantages of their situation with rare understanding.
For the first time in the history of the labour movement, the three sides of the strug­ gle, the theoretical, the political and the practical economic (resistance to the capitalists), are being conducted in harmony, co-ordination and in a planned way.
It is precisely in this, as it were, concentric attack, that the strength and invincibility of the German movement lies.
“It is due to this advantageous situation on the one hand, to the insular peculiarities of the English and to the forcible suppression of the French movements on the other, that the German workers tor the moment form the vanguard of the proletarian struggle.
How long events will allow them to occupy tliis post of honour cannot be foreseen.
But as long us they occupy it.
let us hope that they will discharge their duties in the proper manner.
To this end it will be necessary to redouble our energies in every sphere of struggle and agitation.
It is the specific duty of the leaders to gain an ever-cleurcr insight into all theoretical questions, to free them-4 Lenin II selves more and more from the influence of traditional phrases inherited from the old conception of the world, and constantly to keep in mind that socialism, having become a science, must be pursued as a science, i.
e,, it must be studied.
The task will be to spread with increased enthusi­ asm, among the masses of the workers, the ever-clearer insight thus ac­ quired, to knit together ever more firmly the organisation both of the Party and of the trade unions.
.
.
.
“If the German workers proceed in this way, they will not march ex­ actly at the head of the movement—it is not in the interests of the move­ ment that the workers of any one country should march at its head—but they will occupy an honourable place in the battle line, and they will stand armed for battle when either unexpectedly grave trials or momentous events demand heightened courage, heightened determination and power to act/' x Engels’ words proved prophetic.
Within a few years, the Ger­ man workers were subjected to severe trials in the form of the Anti-Socialist Law; but they were fully armed to meet the situa­ tion, and succeeded in emerging from it victoriously.
The Russian proletariat will have to undergo trials immeasur­ ably more severe; it will have to take up the fight against a monster, compared with which the Anti-Socialist Law in a con­ stitutional country is but a pigmy.
History has now confronted us with an immediate task which is more revolutionary than all the immediate tasks that confront the proletariat of any other country.
The fulfilment of this task, the destruction of the most powerful bulwark not only of European but also (it may now be said) of Asiatic reaction would place the Russian proletariat in the vanguard of the international revolutionary proletariat.
We are right in counting upon acquiring the honourable title already earned by our predecessors, the revolutionaries of the ’seventies, if we succeed in inspiring our movement—which is a thousand times wdder and deeper—with the same devoted de­ termination and vigour.
‘Third edition, Leipzig, 1875.
II THE SPONTANEITY OF THE MASSES AND THE CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS OF SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY We have said that our movement, much wider and deeper than the movement of the ’seventies, must be inspired with the same devoted determination and energy that inspired the movement at that time.
Indeed, no one, we think, has up to now doubted that the strength of the modern movement lies in the awaken­ ing of the masses (principally, the industrial proletariat), and that its weakness lies in the lack of consciousness and initiative among the revolutionary leaders.
However, a most astonishing discovery has been made re­ cently, which threatens to overthrow’ all the views that have hitherto prevailed on this question.
This discovery was made by Rabocheye Dyelo, which in its controversy with Iskra and Zarya did not confine itself to making objections on separate points, but tried to ascribe “general disagreements” to a more profound cause—to the “disagreement concerning the estimation of tire relative importance of the spontaneous and consciously ‘methodicar element” Rabocheye Dyelo" s indictment reads: “belittling the importance of the objective, or spontaneous, ele­ ment of development” 1 To this we say: if the controversy with Iskra and Zarya resulted in absolutely nothing more than caus­ ing Rabocheye Dyelo to lot upon these “general disagree­ ments,” that single result would give us considerable satisfac­ tion, so important is this thesis and so clearly does it illuminate the quintessence of the present-day theoretical and political dif­ ferences that exist among Russian Social-Democrats.
Thal is why the question of the relation betw’cen conscious-1 Rabocheye Dyelo, No.
10, 1901, pp.
17-18.
(R.
D.
’s italics.
) 51 <• ness and spontaneity is of such enormous general interest, and that is why this question must be dealt with in great detail.
A.
The Beginning of the Spontaneous Revival In the previous chapter we pointed out how universally ab­ sorbed the educated youth of Russia was in the theories of Marxism in the middle of the ’nineties.
The strikes that followed the famous St.
Petersburg industrial war of 1896 * assumed a similar wholesale character.
The fact that these strikes spread over the whole of Russia clearly showed how deep the reviving popular movement was, and if we must speak of the “spontaneous element” then, of course, we must admit that this strike move­ ment certainly bore a spontaneous character.
But there is a difference between spontaneity and spontaneity.
Strikes occurred in Russia in the ’seventies and in the ’sixties (and also in the first half of the nineteenth century), and these strikes were accompanied by the “spontaneous” destruction of machinery, etc.
Compared with these “riots” the strikes of the ’nineties might even be described as “conscious,” to such an extent do they mark the progress which the labour movement had made for that period.
This shows that the “spontaneous element,” in essence, represents nothing more nor less than consciousness in an embryonic form.
Even the primitive riots expressed the awakening of consciousness to a certain extent: the workers abandoned their age-long faith in the permanence of the system which oppressed them.
They began, I shall not say to under­ stand, but to sense the necessity for collective resistance, and definitely abandoned their slavish submission to their super­ iors.
But all this was more in the nature of outbursts of des­ peration and vengeance than of struggle, The strikes of the ’nineties revealed far greater flashes of consciousness: definite demands were pul forward, the time to strike was carefully chosen, known cases and examples in other places were dis­ cussed, etc.
While the riots were simply uprisings of the op­ pressed, the systematic strikes represented the class struggle in embryo, but only in embryo.
Taken by themselves, these strikes were simply trade union struggles, but not yet Social-Dem-ocratic struggles.
They testified to the awakening antagonisms between workers and employers, but the workers were not and could not be conscious of the irreconcilable antagonism of their interests to the whole of the modern political and social system, i.
e.
, it was not yet Social-Democratic consciousness.
In this sense, the strikes of the ’nineties, in spite of the enormous pro­ gress they represented as compared with the “riots,” represented a purely spontaneous movement.
We said that there could not yet be Social-Democratic con­ sciousness among the workers.
Tins consciousness could only be brought to them from without The history of all countries shows that the working class, exclusively by its own effort, is able to develop only trade union consciousness, i.
e.
, it may it­ self realise the necessity for combining in unions, for fighting against the employers and for striving to compel the govern­ ment to pass necessary labour legislation, etc.
1 The theory of socialism, however, grew out of the philosophic, historical and economic theories that were elaborated by the educated repre­ sentatives of the propertied classes, the intellectuals.
According to their social status, the founders of modern scientific social­ ism, Marx and Engels, themselves belonged to the bourgeois intelligentsia.
Similarly, in Russia, the theoretical doctrine of Social-Democracy arose quite independently of the spontaneous growth of the labour movement; it arose as a natural and in­ evitable outcome of the development of ideas among the rev­ olutionary socialist intelligentsia.
At the time of which we are speaking, i.
e.
, the middle of the ’nineties, this doctrine not only represented the completely formulated programme of the Eman­ cipation of Labour group, but had already won the adherence of the majority of the revolutionary youth in Russia.
Hence, simultaneously, we had the spontaneous awakening of the masses of the workers, the awakening to conscious life and struggle, as well as the revolutionary youth, armed with the 1 Trade unionism does not exclude “politics’* altogether, a® some im­ agine.
Trade unions have always conducted political (but not Social-Dem­ ocratic) agitation and struggle.
We shall deal with the difference between trade union politics and Social-Democratic politics in the next chapter, Social-Democratic theories, striving to reach the workers.
In this connection it is particularly important to state the oft-for­ gotten (and comparatively little-known) fact that the early Social-Democrats of that period zealously carried on economic agitation (being guided in this by the really useful instructions contained in the pamphlet On Agitation* that was still in manu­ script), but they did not regard this as their sole task.
On the contrary, from the very outset they brought forward the widest historical tasks of Russian Social-Democracy, and particularly the task of overthrowing the autocracy.
For example, the St.
Peters­ burg group of Social-Democrats, which formed the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class, towards the end of 1895, prepared the first number of the newspaper called Rabocheye Dyelo, This number was completely ready for the press when it was seized by the gendarmes who, on the night of December 8, 1895, raided the house of one of the members of the group, Anatole Alekseyevich Vaneyev,1 and so the original Rcbocheye Dyelo was not fated to see the light.
The leading article in this number (which perhaps in thirty years’ time some Russkaya Starina2 will discover in the archives of the Department of Police) described the historical tasks of the working class in Russia, of winch the achievement of political liberty is regarded as the most important.
This num­ ber also contained an article entitled “What Are Our Cabinet Ministers Thinking Of?” which dealt with the breaking up of the elementary education committees by the police.
In addition, there was some correspondence, from St.
Petersburg, as well as from other parts of Russia (for example, a let­ ter about the assault on the workers in the Yaroslav Gubernia).
Ulis, if we are not mistaken, “first attempt” of the Russian Social-Democrats of the ’nineties was not a narrow, lo­ cal, and certainly not an “economic” newspaper, but one that 1 A.

strove to unite the strike movement with the revolutionary movement against the autocracy, and to win all the victims of oppression and political and reactionary obscurantism over to the side of Social-Democracy.
No one in the slightest degree acquainted with the state of the movement at that period could doubt that such a paper would have been fully approved of by the workers of the capital and the revolution­ ary intelligentsia and would have had a wide circulation.
The failure of the enterprise merely showed -that the Social-Demo­ crats of that time were unable to meet the immediate require­ ments of the time owing to their lack of revolutionary experience and practical training.
The same thing must be said with re­ gard to the St.
Petersburg Rabochy Listok* and particularly with regard to Rabochaya Cazeta and the Manifesto of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party which was established in the spring of 1898.
Of course, we would not dream of blaming the Social-Democrats of that time for this unprepared­ ness.
But in order to obtain the benefit of die experi­ ence of that movement, and to learn practical lessons from it, we must thoroughly understand the causes and significance of this or that shortcoming.
For that reason it is extremely im­ portant to establish the fact that part (perhaps even a majority) of the Social-Democrats, operating in the period of 1895-98, quite justly considered it possible even then, at the very begin­ ning of the “spontaneous movement.

2 “Iskra, which adopts a hostile attitude towards the activities of the Social Democrats of the end of the ’nineties, ignores the fact that at that time the conditions for any other kind of work except fighting for petty demands were absent,” declare the Economists in their Letter to Russian SociaLDemocratic Organs.
(Iskra.
No.
12.
) The facts quoted above show that the statement about “absent conditions” is the very opposite of the truth.
Not only at the end, but even in the middle of the ’nineties, all the conditions existed for other work, besides fighting for petty demands, all the conditions—except sufficient training of the leaders.
Instead of frankly admitting our, the ideologists’, the leaders’, lack of sufficient training—the Economists try to throw the blame entirely upon the “absent conditions,” upon the influence of material environ­ ment which determines the road from which it will be impossible for any training of the majority of the revolutionaries, being quite a natural phenomenon, could not have aroused any particular fears.
Since the tasks were properly defined, since the energy existed for repeated attempts to fulfil these tasks, the temporary failures were not such a great misfortune.
Revolutionary ex­ perience and organisational skill are things that can be acquired provided the desire is there to acquire these qualities, provided the shortcomings are recognised—which in revolutionary activ­ ity is more than halfway towards removing them! It was a great misfortune, however, when this consciousness began to grow dim (it was very active among the workers of the group mentioned), when people appeared—and even Social-Democratic organs—who were prepared to regard shortcomings as virtues, who even tried to invent a theoretical basis for slavish cringing before spontaneity.
It is time to summarise this tendency, the substance of which is incorrectly and too narrowly described as “Economism.
” B.
Bowing to Spontaneity Rabochaya My si Before dealing with the literary manifestation of this subserv­ ience, we should like to mention the following characteristic fact (communicated to us from the above-mentioned source), which throws some light on the circumstances in which the two future conflicting tendencies in Russian Social-Democracy arose and grew among the comrades working in St.
Petersburg.
In the beginning of 1897, prior to their banishment, A.
A.
Vaneyev and several of his comrades attended a private meeting at which the “old” and “young” members of the League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class were gathered.
The con­ versation centred chiefly around the question of organisation, and particularly around the “rules for a workers’ benefit fund.
” which, in their final form, were published in Listok Rabotnika? No.
9-10, p.
46.
* Sharp differences were immediately re­ ideologist to divert the movement.
What is this but slavish cringing before spontaneity, the fact that the “ideologists” are enamoured of their own shortcomings? vealed between the “old” members (the “Decembrists.
” as the St.
Petersburg Social-Democrats jestingly called them1) and several of the “young” members (who subsequently took an active part in the work of Rabochaya Mysl), and a very heated discussion ensued.
The “young” members defended the main principles of the rules in the form in which they were published.
The “old” members said that this was not what was wanted, that first of all it was necessary to con­ solidate the League of Struggle into an organisation of rev­ olutionaries which should have control of all the various work­ ers* benefit funds, students’ propaganda circles, etc.
It goes without saying that the controversialists had no suspicion at that time that these disagreements were the beginning of a diver­ gence; on the contrary they regarded them as being of an isolated and casual nature.
But this fact shows that “Economism” did not arise and spread in Russia without a fighj on the part of the “old” Social-Democrats (the Economists of today are apt to forget this).
And if.
in the main, this struggle has not left “documentary” traces behind it, it is solely because the membership of the circles working at that time underwent such constant change that no continuity was established and, con­ sequently, differences were not recorded in any documents.
The appearance of Rabochaya My si brought Economism to the light of day, but not all at once.
We must picture to our­ selves concretely the conditions of the work and the short-lived character of the majority of the Russian circles (and only those who have experienced this can have any exact idea of it), in order to understand how much there was accidental in the suc­ cesses and failures of the new tendency in various towns, and why for a long time neither the advocates nor the opponents of this “new” tendency could make up their minds—indeed they had no opportunity to do so—as to whether this was really a new tendency or whether it was merely an expression of the lack of training of certain individuals.
For example, the first mimeographed copies of Rabochaya Mysl never reached the great 1 Because they, including Lenin, were arrested in December 1895.

), who, of course, did not fail zealously but'Un­ reasonably to extol the new paper, which was so different from the papers and the schemes for papers mentioned above.
1 And this leading article deserves to be dealt with in detail because it so strongly expresses the spirit of Rabochaya Mysl and Econom-ism generally.
After referring to the fact that the arm of the “blue-co at s” could never stop the progress of the labour movement, the lead­ ing article goes on to say: .
The virility of the labour movement is due to the fact that the workers themselves are at last taking their fate into their own hands, and out of the hands of the leaders,” and this fundamental thesis is then developed in greater detail.
As a matter of fact the leaders (i.
e.
, the Social-Democrats, the organisers of the League of Struggle) were, one might say, torn out of the hands of the workers by the police2; yet it is made to appear that the workers were fighting against the leaders, and eventually liberated themselves from their yoke! Instead of calling upon the workers to go forward to­ wards the consolidation of the revolutionary organisation and to the expansion of political activity, they began to call for a retreat to the purely trade union struggle.
They announced that “the economic basis of the movement is eclipsed by the effort never to forget the political idea,” and that the watchword for the movement was “Fight for an economic position” (!) or what is still better, “The workers for the workers.
” It was de-1 It should be stated in passing that the praise of Rabochaya Mysl in November 1898, when Economism had become fully defined, especially abroad, emanated from that same V.

) Catchwords like: “We must concentrate, not on the ‘cream’ of the workers, but on the ‘average* worker—the mass worker”; “Politics always obediently follow economics,”1 etc.
, etc.
, became the fashion, and exercised irresistible influence upon the masses of the youth who were attracted to the movement, but who, in the majority of cases, were acquainted only with legally expounded fragments of Marxism.

” (Leading article in Ra-bochaya Mysl, No, 1.
) Phrases like these have alwrays been the favourite weapons of the West European bourgeoisie, who, while hating socialism, strove (like the German “Sozial-Polit-iker” Hirsch) to transplant English trade unionism to their own soil and to preach to the workers that the purely trade union struggle is the struggle for themselves and for their child­ ren, and not the struggle for some kind of socialism for some future generation.
2 And now the “V.
V.
’s of Russian Social-Democracy” repeat these bourgeois phrases.
It is important at this point to note three circumstances, which will be useful to us in our further analysis of contemporary differences.
8 1 These quotations are taken from the leading article in the first num­ ber of Rabochirya Mysl already referred to.
One can iudge from this the decree of theoretical training possessed by these “V.

’s of Russian So­ cial-Democracy,** who kent repeating the crude vulgarisation of “economic materialism" at a time when the Marxists were earning on a literary war against the real V*.
V.
, who had long ago been dubbed “a past master of reactionary deeds," for holding similar views on the relation between pol­ itics and economics!’The Germans even have a special expression: Nur Gewerkschaftier, which means an advocate of the “pure and simple" trade union struggle.
8 We emphasise the word contemporary for the benefit of those who First of all, the overwhelming of consciousness by spontan­ eity, to which wc referred above, also took place spontaneously.
This may sound like a pun, but, alas, it is the bitter truth.
It did not take place as a result of an open struggle between Iwo diametrically opposed points of view, in which one gained the victory over the other; it occurred because an increasing num­ ber of “old” revolutionaries were “torn away” by the gen­ darmes and because increasing numbers of “young” “V.
V.
’s of Russian Social-Democracy” came upon the scene.
Every­ one, wrho I shall not say has participated in the contemporary Russian movement, hut who has at least breathed its at­ mosphere, knows perfectly well that this was so.
And the reason why we, nevertheless, strongly urge the reader to ponder over this universally known fact, and why we quote the facts, as an illustration, so to speak, about Rabocheye Dyelo as it first ap­ peared, and about the controversy between the “old” and the “young” at the beginning of 1897—is that certain persons are speculating on the public’s (or the very youthful youth’s) ignor­ ance of these facts, and are boasting of their “democracy.
” We shall return to this point further on.
Secondly, in the very first literary manifestation of Econom-ism, we observe the extremely curious and highly character­ istic phenomenon—for understanding the differences prevail­ ing among contemporary Social-Democrats—that the adherents of the “pure and simple” labour movement, the worshippers of the closest “organic” (the term used by Rabocheye Dyelo) contacts with the proletarian struggle, the opponents of the non­ labour intelligentsia (notwithstanding that it is a socialist in­ telligentsia) are compelled, in order to defend their positions, to resort to the arguments of the bourgeois “pure and simple” trade unionists.
This shows that from the very outset, Raboch* aya My si began unconsciously to carry out the programme of the Credo.
This shows (what the Rabocheye Dyelo cannot may pharisaically shrug their shoulders and say: it is easy enough to at­ tack Rabochaya Mvsl now.
but is not all this ancient history? Mulaio nomine de tc fabula narratur [change the name and the tale refers to you—Ed.

understand) that all subservience to the spontaneity of the la­ bour movement, all belittling of the role of “the conscious ele­ ment/’ of the role of Social-Democracy, means, whether one likes it or not, the growth of influence of bourgeois ideology among the workers.
All those who talk about “exaggerating the importance of ideology,”1 about exaggerating the role of the conscious elements,2 etc.
, imagine that the pure and simple labour movement can work out an independent ideology for itself, if only the workers “take their fate out of the hands of the leaders.
” But this is a profound mistake.
To supplement what has been said above, we shall quote the following pro­ foundly true and important utterances by Karl Kautsky on the new draft programme of the Austrian Social-Democratic Party’: “Many of our revisionist critics believe that Marx asserted that economic development and the class struggle create not only the conditions for so­ cialist production, but also, and directly, the consciousness [K.
K.
’s italics] of its necessity.
And these critics advance the argument that the most highly capitalistically developed country, England, is more remote than any other from this consciousness.
Judging from the draft, one might assume that the committee which drafted the Austrian programme shared this alleged orthodox-Marxian view which is thus refuted.
In the draft programme it is stated: ‘The more capitalist development increases the numbers of the proletariat, the more the proletariat is com­ pelled and becomes fit to fight against capitalism.
The proletariat becomes conscious of the possibility of and necessity for socialism/ etc.
In this connection socialist consciousness is represented as a necessary and direct result of the proletarian class struggle.
But this is absolutely un­ true.
Of course, socia’ism, as a theory, has its roots in modem economic relationships just as the class struggle of the proletariat has, and just as the latter emerges from the struggle against the capitalist-created poverty and misery of the masses.
But socialism and the class struggle arise side by side and not one out of the other; each arises under different conditions.
Modem socialist consciousness can arise only on the basis of profound scientific knowledge.
Indeed, modern economic science is as much a condition for socialist production as, say, modern technology, and the proletariat can create neither the one nor the other, no matter how much it may desire to do so; both arise out of the modem social process.
The vehicles of science are not the proletariat, but the bourgeois intelligentsia [K.
K.
’s italics]: it was in the minds of some members of this stratum that modern socialism originated, and it was they 1 Letter of the Economists, in Iskra, No.

The committee’s draft to which Kautsky refers was passed by the Vienna Congress at the end of last year in a slightly amended form.
who communicated it to the more intellectually developed proletarians who, in their turn, introduced it into the proletarian class struggle where conditions allow that to be done.
Thus socialist consciousness is some­ thing introduced into the proletarian class struggle from without (von Aussen Hineingetragenes), and not something that arose within it spon­ taneously (urwüchsig).
Accordingly, the old Hainfeld programme quite rightly stated that the task of Social-Democracy is to imbue the proletariat with the consciousness of its position and the consciousness of its tasks.
There would be no need for this if consciousness emerged of itself from the class struggle.
The new draft copied this proposition from the old pro-gramme, and attached it to the proposition mentioned above.
But this com­ pletely broke the line of thought.
.
.
.
” Since there can be no talk of an independent ideology being developed by the masses of the workers in the process of their movement1 the only choice is: either bourgeois or social­ ist ideology.
There is no middle course (for humanity has not created a “third” ideology, and, moreover, in a society tom by class antagonisms there can never be a non-class or above-class ideology).
Hence, to belittle socialist ideology in any way, to deviate from it in the slightest degree means strengthening bour­ geois ideology.
There is a lot of talk about spontaneity, but the spontaneous development of the labour movement leads to its becoming subordinated to bourgeois ideology, leads to its devel­ oping according to the programme of the Credo, for the spon­ taneous labour movement is pure and simple trade unionism, is Nu^Gewerkschaftlerci, and trade unionism means the ideo­ logical enslavement of the workers to the bourgeoisie.
Hence, our task, the task of Social-Democracy, is to combat spontaneity, 1 ’Phis does not mean, of course, that the workers have no part in creat­ ing auch an ideology.
But they take part not as workers, but as socialist theoreticians, like Proudhon and Weitling; in other words, they take part only to the extent that they arc able, more or less, to acquire the know­ ledge of their age and advance that knowledge.
And in order that work­ ingmen may be able to do this more often, efforts must be made to raise the level of the consciousness of the workers generally; care must be taken that the workers do not confine themselves to the artificially re­ stricted limits of ^literature for workers" but that they study general literature to an increasing degree.
It would be even more true to say “are not confined,” instead of “do not confine themselves,” because the workers themselves wish to read and do read all that is written for the intelligentsia and it is only a few (bad) intellectuals who believe that it is sufficient “for the workers,” to tell them a few things about factory conditions, and to repeat over and over again what has long been known.
to divert the labour movement from its spontaneous, trade unionist striving to go under the wing of the bourgeoisie, and to bring it under the wing of revolutionary Social-Democracy.
The phrases employed by the authors of the “economic” letter in Iskra, No.
12, about the efforts of the most inspired ideologists not being able to divert the labour movement from the path that is determined by the interaction of the material elements and the material environment, are tantamount to the abandonment of socialism, and if only the authors of this letter fearlessly thought out what they say to its logical conclusion, as every­ one who enters the arena of literary and public activity should do, they would have nothing to do but “fold their useless arms over their empty breasts” and .

.
leave the field of action to the Struves and Prokopoviches who are dragging the labour movement “along the line of least resistance,” i.
e.
, along the line of bourgeois trade unionism, or to the Zubatovs who are dragging it along the line of clerical and gendarme “ideology.
” Recall the example of Germany.
What wras the historical service Lassalle rendered to the German labour movement? It was that he diverted that movement from the path of trade uni­ onism and co-operation preached by the Progressives along which it had been travelling spontaneously (with the benign assistance of Schulzc-Delitzsche and those like him).
To fulfill a task like that it was necessary to do something altogether different from indulging in talk about belittling the spontaneous element, about the tactics-process and about the interaction between elements and environment, etc.
A desperate struggle against spontaneity had to be carried on, and only after such a struggle, extending over many years, was it possible to convert the working population of Berlin from a bulwark of the Progressive Party into one of the finest strongholds of Social-Democracy.
This fight is not finished even now (as those who learn the history of the Ger­ man movement from Prokopovich, and its philosophy from Struve, believe).
Even now the German working class is, so to speak, broken up into a number of ideologies.
A section of the workers is organised in Catholic and monarchist labour unions; another section is organised in the Hirsch-Duncker unions,* founded by the bourgeois worshippers of English trade unionism, while a third section is organised in Social-Demo­ cratic trade unions.
The latter is immeasurably more numerous than the rest, but Social-Democracy was able to achieve this superiority, and will be able to maintain it, only by unswerv­ ingly fighting against all other ideologies.
But why, the reader will ask, does the spontaneous movement, the movement along the line of least resistance, lead to the domination of bourgeois ideology? For the simple reason that bourgeois ideology is far older in origin than Social-Demo­ cratic ideology; because it is more fully developed and because it possesses immeasurably more opportunities for being dis­ tributed.
1 And the younger the socialist movement is in any given country, the more vigorously must it fight against all attempts to entrench non-socialist ideology, and the more strong­ ly must it warn the workers against those bad counsellors who shout against “exaggerating the conscious elements,” etc.
The authors of the economic letter, in unison with Rabocheye Dyelo, declaim against the intolerance that is characteristic of the in­ fancy of the movement.
To this we reply: yes, our movement is indeed in its infancy, and in order that it may grow up the more quickly, it must become infected with intolerance against all those who retard its growth by subservience to spontaneity.
Nothing is so ridiculous and harmful as pretending that we are “old hands” who have long ago experienced all the decisive episodes of the struggle! Thirdly, the first number of Rabochaya Mysl shows that the term “Economisni” (which, of course, we do not propose to xIt is often said: the working class spontaneously gravitates towards socialism.
This is perfectly true in the sense that socialist theory defines the causes of the misery of the working class more profoundly and more correctly than any other theory, and lor that reason the workers are able to appreciate it so easily, provided, however, that this theory does not step aside for spontaneity and provided it subordinates spontaneity to itself.
Usually this is taken for granted, but Rabocheye Dyelo forgets or distorts this obvious thing.
The working class spontaneously gravitates towards socialism, but the more widespread (and continuously revived in the moht diverse forms) bourgeois ideology spontaneously imposes itself upon the working class still more.
abandon because this nickname has more or less established itself) does not adequately convey the real character of the new tendency» Rabochaya Mysl does not altogether repudiate the political struggle: the rules for a workers’ benefit fund pub­ lished in Rabochaya Mysl, No.
1, contains a reference to fight­ ing against the government.
* Rabochaya Mysl believes, however, that “politics always obediently follow economics” (and Raboch­ eye Dyelo gives a variation of this thesis when, in its pro­ gramme, it asserts that “in Russia more than in any other country, the economic struggle is inseparable from the political struggle”).
If by politics is meant Social-Democratic politics, then the postulates advanced by Rabochaya Mysl and Rabocheye Dyelo are absolutely wrong.
The economic struggle of the workers is very often connected (although not inseparably) with bourgeois politics, clerical politics, etc.
, as we have already seen.
If by politics is meant trade union politics, i.
e.
, the com­ mon striving of all workers to secure from the government measures for the alleviation of the distress characteristic of their position, but which do not abolish that position, i.
e.
, which do not remove the subjection of labour to capital, then Rabocheye Dyelo’s postulate is correct.
That striving in­ deed is common to the British trade unionists, who are hostile to socialism, to the Catholic workers, to the “Zubatov” work­ ers, etc.
There are politics and politics.
Thus, we see that Ra­ bochaya Mysl does not so much deny the political struggle as bow to its spontaneity, to its lack of consciousness.
While fully recognising the political struggle (it would be more correct to say the political desires and demands of the workers), which arises spontaneously from the labour movement itself, it ab­ solutely refuses independently to work out a specifically Social-Democratic policy corresponding to the general tasks of social­ ism and to contemporary conditions in Russia.
Further on wre shall show that Rabocheye Dyelo commits the same error.
C.
The Self-Emancipation Group and “Rabocheye Dyelo” We have dealt at such length with the little-known and now almost forgotten leading article in the first number of Raboch-5 Lenin 11 aya Mysl because it was the first and most striking expies* sion of that general stream of thought which afterwards emerged into the light of day in innumerable streamlets.
V.
L was absolutely right when, in praising the first number and the leading article of Rabochaya Mysl, he said that it was written in a “sharp and provocative” style.
(Listok Rabotnika, No.
9-10, p.
49.
) Every man with convictions who thinks he has some­ thing new to say writes “provocatively” and expresses his views strongly.
Only those who are accustomed to sitting between two stools lack “provocativeness”; only such people are able to praise the provocativeness of Rabochaya Mysl one day, and at­ tack the ‘‘provocative polemics” of its opponents the next.
We shall not dwell on the Special Supplement to Rabochaya Mysl (further on we shall have occasion, on a number of points, to refer to this work, which expresses the ideas of the Econom­ ists more consistently than any other) but shall briefly mention the Manifesto of the Self-Emancipation of the Workers Group, (March 1899, reprinted in the London Nakanunye,1 No.
7, June 1899.
) The authors of this manifesto quite rightly say that “the workers of Russia are only just awakening, are only just looking around, and instinctively clutch at the first means of struggle that come to their hands.
” But from this cor­ rect observation, they draw the same incorrect conclusion that is drawn by Rabochaya Mysl, forgetting that instinct is that un­ consciousness (spontaneity) to the aid of which Socialists must come; that the “first means of struggle that come to their hands” will always be, in modern society, the trade union means of struggle, and the “first” ideology “that comes to hand” will be bourgeois (trade union) ideology.
Similarly, these authors do not “repudiate” politics, they merely say (merely!), repeating what was said by V.
V.
, that politics is the superstructure, and therefore, “political agitation must be the superstructure to the agitation carried on in favour of the economic struggle; it must arise on the basis of this struggle and follow behind it.
” As for Rabocheye Dyclo, it commenced its activity by “a de­ fence” of the Economists.
It uttered a downright falsehood in its *On the Eve.

In the controversy that flared up with Axelrod and Plekhanov over this falsehood, Rabocheye Dyelo was compelled to admit that “by expressing ignorance, it desired to defend all the younger Social-Democrats abroad from this unjust accusa­ tion” (Axelrod accused the Economists of having a limited outlook).
As a matter of fact this accusation was absolutely just, and Rabocheye Dyelo knows perfectly well that, among others, it applied to V.

We shall observe in passing that in this controversy Axelrod was absolutely right and Rabocheye Dyelo was absolutely wrong in their respective interpretations of my pamphlet The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats.
“ That pamphlet was written in 1897, before the appearance of Rabochaya Mysl when I thought, and rightly thought, that the original tendency of the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle, which I describe above, was the predom­ inant one.
At all events, that tendency was the predominant one until the middle of 1898.
Consequently, in its attempt to refute the existence and dangers of Economism, Rabocheye Dyelo had no right whatever to refer to a pamphlet which expressed views that were squeezed out by Economist views in St.
Peters­ burg in 1897-98.
But Rabocheye Dyelo not only “defended” the Economists— it itself constantly fell into fundamental Economist errors.
The cause of these errors is to be found in the ambiguity of the in­ terpretation given to the following thesis in Rabocheye Dyelo" s programme: “We consider that the most important phenomenon of Russian life, the one that will mostly determine the tasks [our italics] and the character of the literary activity of the ‘League,’ is the mass labour movement [Rabocheye Dyelo* s ital­ ics] that has arisen in recent years.
” That the mass movement is a most important phenomenon is a fact about which there can * The Contemporary Tasks and Tactics of the Russian Social-Democrats, Geneva, 1898.

be no dispute.
But the crux of the question is, what is the mean­ ing of the phrase: the labour movement will “determine the tasks”? It may be interpreted in one of two ways.
Either it means subservience to the spontaneity of this movement, i.
e.
, reducing the role of Social-Democracy to mere subservience to the labour movement as such (the interpretation given to it by Rabochaya My si, the Self-Emancipation group and other Econ­ omists) ; or it may mean that the mass movement puts before us new, theoretical, political and organisational tasks, far more complicated than those that might have satisfied us in the period before the rise of the mass movement.
Rabocheye Dyelo inclined and still inclines towards the first interpretation, for it said noth­ ing definitely about new tasks, but argued all the time as if the “mass movement” relieved us of the necessity of clearly appreciating and fulfilling the tasks it sets before us.
We need only point out that Rabocheye Dyelo considered that it was impossible to put the overthrow of the autocracy as the first task of the mass labour movement, and that it degraded this task (ostensibly in the interests of the mass movement) to the struggle for immediate political demands.
(Reply, p.
25.
) We shall pass over the article by B.
Krichevsky, the editor of Rabocheye Dyelo, entitled “The Economic and Political Struggle in the Russian Movement,” published in No.
7 of that paper, in which these very mistakes 1 are repeated, and take up Rabocheye Dyelo, No.
10.
1 The “stages theory,” or the theory of “timid zigzags” in the polit­ ical struggle, is expressed in this article approximately in the following way: “Political demands, which in their character are common to the whole of Russia, should, however, at first [this was written in August 1900!] correspond to the experience gained by the given stratum [sic! ] of workers in the economic struggle.
Only [!1 on the basis of this ex­ perience can and should political agitation be taken up,” etc.
(P.
11.
) On page 4, the author, protesting against what he regards as the ab­ solutely unfounded charge of Economist heresy, pathetically exclaims: “What Social-Democrat does not know that according to the theories of Marx and Engels the economic interests of various classes are the decisive factors in history, and, consequently, that the proletariat’s struggle for the defence of its economic interests must be of first-rate importance in its class development and struggle for emancipation?” (Our italics.
) The word “consequently” is absolutely out of place.
The fact that economic interests are a decisive factor does not in the least imply that the economic (i.

, We shall not, of course, enter in detail into the various ob­ jections raised by B.
Krichevsky and Martynov against Zarya and Iskra.
What interests us here solely is the theoretical posi­ tion taken up by Rabocheye Dyelo, No.
10.
For example, we shall not examine the literary curiosity—that Rabocheye Dyelo saw a “diametrical” contradiction between the proposition: “Social-Democracy does not tie its hands, it does not restrict its activ­ ities to some preconceived plan or method of political struggle; it recog­ nises all methods of struggle, as long as they correspond to the forces at the disposal of the Party.
.
.
.
” (Iskra, No.
1-2.
1) and the proposition: .
.
.
“without a strong organisation, tested in the political struggle car­ ried on under all circumstances and in all periods, there can be no talk of a systematic plan of activity, enlightened by firm principles and unswervingly carried out, which alone is worthy of being called tactics.
(Iskra, No.
4.
2) To confuse the recognition, in principle, of all means of strug­ gle, of all plans and methods, as long as they are expedient— with the necessity at a given political moment for being guided by a strictly adhered-to plan, if we are to talk of tactics, is tantamount to confusing the recognition by medical science of all kinds of treatment of diseases with the necessity for adopting a certain definite method of treatment for a given disease.
The point is, however, that Rabocheye Dyelo, while suffering from a disease which we have called subservience to spontaneity, refuses to recognise any “method of treatment” for that disease.
Hence, it made the remarkable discovery that “a tactics plan con-trade union) struggle must be the main factor, for the essential and “decisive” interests of classes can be satisfied only by radical political changes in general.
In particular the fundamental economic interests of the proletariat can be satisfied only by a political revolution that will substitute the dictatorship of the proletariat for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.
B.
Krichevsky repeats the arguments of the “V.
V/s of Russian Social-Democracy” (i.
e.
.
politics follow economics, etc.
) and the Bemsteinists of German Social-Democracy (for example, by arguments like these, Woltmann tried to prove that the workers must first of all acquire “economic power” before they can think about political revo­ lution).

tradicts the fundamental spirit of Marxism” (No.
10» p.
18), that tactics are “a process of growth of Party tasks, which grow with the Party.
” (P.
11, Rabocheye Dyelo’s italics.
) The latter remark has every chance of becoming a celebrated maxim» a permanent monument to the tendency of Rabocheye Dyelo.
To the question: whither? a leading organ replies: the movement is a process of alteration in the distance between starting point and destination of the movement.
This matchless example of pro-fundity is not merely a literary curiosity (if it were, it would not be worth dealing with at length), but the programme of the whole tendency, i.
e.
, the programme which R.
M.
(in the Special Supplement to Rabochaya Mysl) expressed in the words: “That struggle is desirable which is possible, and the struggle which is possible is the one that is going on at the given moment.
” It is the tendency of unbounded opportunism, which passively adapts itself to spontaneity.
“A tactics plan contradicts the fundamental spirit of Marx­ ism”! But this is a libel on Marxism; it is like the caricature of it that was presented to us by the Narodniki in their fight against us.
It means putting restraint on the initiative and energy of class conscious fighters, whereas Marxism, on the contrary, gives a gigantic impetus to the initiative and energy of Social-Democrats, opens up for them the widest perspectives and, if one may so express it.
places at their disposal the mighty force of millions and millions of workers “spontaneously” rising for the struggle.
The whole history of international Social-Dem­ ocracy seethes with plans advanced first by one and then by an­ other political leader; some confirming the far-sightedness and correct political and organisational insight of their authors and others revealing their short-sightedness and lack of political judgment.
At the time when Germany was at one of the most important turning points in its history, the time of the establishment of the Empire, the opening of the Reichstag and the granting of universal suffrage,* Liebknecht had one plan for Social-Democratic policy and work and Schweitzer had an­ other.
When the Anti-Socialist Law came down on the heads of the German Socialists» Most and Hasselmann had one plan, that is, to call for violence and terror; Hochberg, Schramm and (partly) Bernstein had another, which they began to preach to the Social-Democrats, somewhat as follows: they themselves had provoked the passing of the Anti-Socialist Law by being un­ reasonably bitter and revolutionary, and must now show that they deserve pardon by exemplary conduct.
There was yet a third plan proposed by those who paved the way for and carried out Hie publication of an illegal organ.
It is easy, of course, in retrospect, many years after the fight over the selection of the path to be followed has ended, and after history has pro­ nounced its verdict as to the expediency of the path selected, to utter profound maxims about the growth of Party tasks that grow with the Party.
But at a time of confusion.
1 when the Rus­ sian “critics” and Economists degrade Social-Democracy to the level of trade unionism, and when the terrorists are strongly advocating the adoption of a “tactics plan” that repeats the old mistakes, at such a time, to confine oneself to such profundities, means simply issuing oneself a “certificate of mental pov­ erty.
” At a time when many Russian Social-Democrats suffer from lack of initiative and energy, from a lack of “scope of polit­ ical propaganda, agitation and organisation,” 2 a lack of “plans” for a broader organisation of revolutionary work, at such a time, to say: “a tactics plan contradicts the fundamental spirit of Marxism,” not only means theoretically vulgarising Marx­ ism, but also practically dragging the Party backward.
Ra-bo ch eye Dyelo goes on sermonising: “The revolutionary Social-Democrat is only confronted by the task of accelerating objective development by his con«rimis work: it is not his task to obviate it or substitute his own subjective plans for this devel­ opment.
Iskra knows all this in theory.
But the enormous importance which Marxism Quite justly attaches to conscious revolutionary work causes it in practice, owing to its doctrinaire view of tactics, to belittle the significance of the objective or the spontaneous element of devel­ opment * (P.
18.
) * Ein Jahr der Verwirrung [A Year of Confusion] is the title Mehring gave to the chapter of his History of German Social-Democracy in which be describes the hesitancy and lack of determination displayed at first by the Socialists in selecting the “tactics plan’* for the new situation.

Another example of the extraordinary theoretical confusion worthy of V.
V.
and that fraternity.
We would ask our philo­ sopher: how may a deviser of subjective plans “belittle” object-tive development? Obviously by losing sight of the fact that this objective development creates or strengthens, destroys or weakens certain classes, strata, groups, nations, groups of na­ tions, etc.
, and in this way creates a definite international polit­ ical grouping of forces, determining the position of revolution­ ary parties, etc.
If the deviser of plans did that, his mistake would not be that he belittled the spontaneous element, but that he belittled the conscious element, for he would then show that he lacked the “consciousness” that would enable liim properly to understand objective development.
Hence, the very talk about “estimating the relative significance” {Rabocheye Dyelo's italics) of spontaneity and consciousness sufficiently reveals a complete lack of “consciousness.
” If certain “spontaneous elements of development” can be grasped at all by human understanding, then an incorrect estimation of them would be tantamount to “belittling the conscious clement.
” But if they cannot be grasped, then we cannot be aware of them, and therefore cannot speak of them.
What is B.
Krichevsky arguing about then? If he thinks that Iskra's “subjective plans” are erroneous (as he in fact declares them to be), then he ought to show what object­ ive facts are ignored in these plans, and then charge Iskra with a lack of consciousness for ignoring them, with, to use his own words, “belittling the conscious element.
” If, how­ ever, while being displeased with subjective plans he can bring forward no other argument than that of “belittling the spon­ taneous element” (!!) lie merely shows: 1) that he theoretically understands Marxism a Ia Kareyevs and Mikhailovskys, who have been sufficiently ridiculed by Beltov, and 2) that, practi­ cally, he is quite pleased with the “spontaneous elements of development” that have drawn our “legal Marxists” towards Bern-steinism and our Social-Democrats towards Economism, and that he is full of wrath against those who have determined at all costs to divert Russian Social-Democracy from the path of spon­ taneous development.
Rabocheye Dyelo accuses Iskra and Zarya of “setting up their programme against the movement, like a spirit hovering over die formless chaos?’ (P.
29.
) But what else is the function of So­ cial-Democracy if not to be a “spirit,” not only hovering over the spontaneous movement, but also raising the movement to the level of “its programme”? Surely, it is not its function to drag at die tail of the movement: at best, this would be of no service to the movement; at the worst, it would be very, very harmful.
Rabocheye Dyelo, however, not only follows this “tac­ tics-process,” but elevates it to a principle, so that it would be more correct to describe its tendency not as opportunism, but as khvostism (from the word khvost').
And it must be admitted that those who have determined always to follow behind the movement like a tail are absolutely and forever ensured against “belittling the spontaneous element of development.
” * ♦ * And so, we have become convinced that the fundamental error committed by the “new tendency” in Russian Social-Democracy lies in its subservience to spontaneity, and its failure to under­ stand that the spontaneity of the masses demands a mass of consciousness from us Social-Democrats.
The greater the spon­ taneous uprising of the masses, the more widespread the move­ ment becomes, so much the more rapidly grows the demand for greater consciousness in the theoretical, political and organisa­ tional w’ork of Social-Democracy.
The spontaneous rise of the masses in Russia proceeded (and continues) with such rapidity that the young untrained Social-Democrats proved unfitted for the gigantic tasks that confronted them.
This lack of training is our common misfortune, the mis­ fortune of all Russian Social-Democrats.
The rise of the mas»se? proceeded and spread uninterruptedly and continuously; it not only continued in the places it commenced in, but it spread to new localities and to new strata of the population (influenced by the labour movement, the ferment among the students, the intellectuals generally and even among the peasantry revived), lKhws( is the Russian word for tail.
—Ed, Eng.
ed.
Revolutionaries, however, lagged behind this rise of the masses both in their “theories” and in their practical activity; they failed to establish an uninterrupted organisation having con­ tinuity with the past, and capable of leading the whole move­ ment.
In chapter I, we proved that Rabocheye Dyelo degraded our theoretical tasks and that it “spontaneously” repeated the fashion­ able catchword “freedom of criticism”: that those who re­ peated this catchword lacked the “consciousness” to understand that the positions of the opportunist “critics” and the revolution­ aries, both in Germany and in Russia, are diametrically opposed to each other.
In the following chapters, we shall show how this subservience to spontaneity found expression in the sphere of the political tasks and the organisational work of Social-Democracy.
HI TRADE UNION POLITICS AND SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC POLITICS We shall start off again by praising Rabocheye Dyelo.
Martynov gave his article in No.
10 of Rabocheye Dyelo, on his differences with Iskra, the title ‘"Exposure Literature and the Proletarian Struggle.
” He formulated the substance of these differences as follows: “We cannot confine ourselves entirely to exposing the system that stands in its [the labour party’s] path of development.
We must also respond to the immediate and current interests of the proletariat.
” “.
• • Iskra .

is in fact the organ of revolutionary opposition that exposes the state of affairs in our country, particularly the political state of affairs.
.
.
.
We, however, work and shall continue to work for the cause of labour in close organic contact with the proletarian struggle.
” (P.
63.
) One cannot help being grateful to Martynov for this formula.
It is of outstanding general interest because substantially it em­ braces not only our disagreements with Rabocheye Dyelo, but the general disagreement between ourselves and the Economists concerning the political struggle.
We have already shown that the Economists do not altogether repudiate “politics,” but that they are constantly deviating from the Social-Democratic con­ ception of politics to the trade unionist conception.
Martynov deviates in exactly the same way, and we agree, therefore, to take his views as an example of Economist error on this question.
As we shall endeavour to prove, neither the authors of the Special Supplement to Rabochaya Mysl, nor the authors of the manifesto issued by the Self-Emancipation group, nor the authors of the economic letter published in Iskra, No.
12, will have any right to complain against this choice.
75 A.
Political Agitation and Its Restriction by the Economists Everyone knows that the spread and consolidation of the economic1 struggle of the Russian workers proceeded simultan­ eously with the creation of a “literature” exposing economic con­ ditions, i.
e.
, factory and industrial conditions.
These “leaflets” were devoted mainly to the exposure of factory conditions, and very soon a passion for exposures was roused among the work­ ers.
As soon as the workers realised that the Social-Democratic circles desired to and could supply them with a new kind of leaflet that told the whole truth about their poverty-stricken lives, about their excessive toil and their lack of rights, cor­ respondence began to pour in from the factories and workshops.
This “exposure literature” created a huge sensation not only in the particular factory dealt with, the conditions of which were exposed in a given leaflet, but in all the factories to which news had spread about the facts exposed.
And as the poverty and want among the workers in the various enterprises and in the various trades are pretty much the same, the “truth about the life of the workers” roused the admiration of all.
Even among the most backward workers, a veritable passion was roused to “go into print”—a noble passion for this rudimentary form of war against the whole of the modern social system which is based upon robbery and oppression.
And in the overwhelming majority of cases these “leaflets” were in truth a declaration of war, because the exposures had a terrifically rousing effect upon the workers; it stimulated them to put forward demands for the removal of the most glaring evils and roused in them a readi­ ness to support these demands with strikes.
Finally, the em­ ployers themselves wTere compelled to recognise the significance of these leaflets as a declaration of war, so much so that in a large number of cases they did not even wait for the outbreak 1 In order to avoid misunderstanding we would state that here and throughout this pamphlet, by economic struggle, we mean (in accord­ ance with the meaning of the term as it has become accepted among us) the “practical economic struggle” which Engels, in the passage quoted above, described as “resistance to capitalism,” and which in free countries is known as the trade union struggle.
of hostilities.
As is always the case, the mere publication of these exposures made them effective, and they acquired the significance of a strong moral force.
On more than one occasion, the mere appearance of a leaflet proved sufficient to secure the satisfaction of all or part of the demands put forward.
In a word, economic (factory) exposures have been and are an im­ portant lever in the economic struggle and they will continue to be such as long as capitalism, which creates the need for the workers to defend themselves, exists.
Even in the more advanced countries of Europe today, the exposure of the evils in some backward trade, or in some forgotten branch of domestic in­ dustry, serves as a starting point for the awakening of class consciousness, for the beginning of a trade union struggle, and for the spread of socialism.
1 Recently, the overwhelming majority of Russian Social-Demo­ crats were almost wholly engaged in this work of organising the exposure of factory conditions.
It is sufficient to refer to the columns of Rabochaya My si to judge to what extent they were engaged in it.
So much so, indeed, that they lost sight of the fact that -this, taken by itself, is not in essence Social-Democratic work, but merely trade union work.
As a matter of fact, these exposures merely dealt with the relations between the workers in a given trade and their immediate employers, 1 In the present chapter, we deal only with the political struggle, whether it is to be understood in its broader or narrower sense.
There­ fore, we refer only in passing, merely to point out a curiosity, to the accusation that Rabocheye Dyelo hurls against Iskra of being “too re­ strained” in regard to the economic struggle.
(Two Congresses, p.
27, rehashed by Martynov in his pamphlet Social-Democracy and the fork­ ing Class,) If those who make this accusation counted up in terms of hundredweights or reams, as they are so fond of doing, what has been said about the economic struggle in the industrial column of Iskra in one year’s issue, and compared this with the industrial columns of Rabocheye Dyelo and Rabochaya My si taken together, they would see that they lag very much behind even in this respect.
Apparently, the consciousness of this simple truth compels them to resort to argu­ ments which clearly reveal their confusion.
“Iskra,” they write, “willy-nilly [I] is compelled [!] to take note of the imperative demands of life and to publish at least [!! ] correspondence about the labour move­ ment.
” (Two Congresses, p.
27.
) Now this is really a crushing argu­ ment! and all that they achieved was that the vendors of labour power learned to sell their “commodity” on better terms and to fight the purchasers of labour power over a purely commercial deal.
These exposures could have served (if properly utilised by rev­ olutionaries) as a beginning and a constituent part of Social-Democratic activity, but they could also have led (and with sub­ servience to spontaneity inevitably had to lead) to a “pure and simple” trade union struggle and to a non-Social-Democratic labour movement.
Social-Democrats lead the struggle of the working class not only for better terms for the sale of labour power, but also for the abolition of the social system which compels the propertyless to sell themselves to the rich.
Social-Democracy represents the working class, not in relation to a given group of employers, but in its relation to all classes in modern society, to the state as an organised political force.
Hence, it not only follows that Social-Democrats must not con­ fine themselves entirely to the economic struggle; they must not even allow the organisation of economic exposures to become the predominant part of their activities.
We must actively take up the political education of the working class and the develop­ ment of its political consciousness.
Now, after Zarya and Iskra have made the first attack upon Economism “all are agreed” on this (although some agreed only nominally, as we shall soon prove).
The question now arises: what does political education mean? Is it sufficient to confine oneself to the propaganda of working class hostility to autocracy? Of course not.
It is not enough to explain to the workers that they are politically oppressed (no •more than it was to explain to them that their interests were antagonistic to the interests of the employers).
Advantage must be taken of every concrete example of this oppression for the purpose of agitation (in the same way that we began to use con­ crete examples of economic oppression for the purpose of agita­ tion).
And inasmuch as political oppression affects all sorts of classes in society, inasmuch as it manifests itself in various spheres of life and activity, in industrial life, civic life, in per­ sonal and family life, in religious life, scientific life, etc.
, etc.
, is it not evident that we shall not be fulfilling our task of de­ veloping the political consciousness of the workers if we do not undertake the organisation of the political exposure of auto­ cracy in all Us aspects? In order to carry on agitation around concrete examples of oppression, these examples must be exposed (just as it was necessary to expose factory evils in order to carry on economic agitation).
One would think that this was clear enough.
It turns out, however, that “all” are agreed that it is necessary to develop political consciousness, in all its aspects, only in words.
It turns out that Rabocheye Dyelo, for example, has not only failed to take up the task of organising (or to make a start in organ­ ising) all-sided political exposure, but is even trying to drag Iskra, which has undertaken tills task, away from it.
Listen to this: “The political struggle of the working class is merely [it is precisely not “merely”] a more developed, a wider and more effective form of economic struggle.
” (Programme of Rabocheye Dyelo, published in No.
1, p.
3.
) “The Social-Democrats are now confronted with the task of, as far as possible, giving the econ­ omic struggle itself a political character.
” (Martynov, Raboch­ eye Dyelo, No.
10, p.
42.
) “The economic struggle is the most widely applicable method of drawing the masses into active political struggle.
” (Resolution passed by the Congress of the League and “amendments” thereto, Two Congresses, pp.
11 and 17.
) As the reader will observe, all these postulates per­ meate Rabocheye Dyelo, from its very first number to the re­ cently issued “Instructions to the Editors,” and all of them evi­ dently express a single view regarding political agitation and the political struggle.
Examine this view from the standpoint of the opinion prevailing among all Economists, that political agitation must follow economic agitation.
Is it true that, in general,1 the 1 We say “in general/’ because Rabocheye Dyelo speaks of general principles and of the general tasks of the whole Party.
Undoubtedly, cases occur in practice, when politics must follow economics, but only Economists can say a thing like that in a resolution that was intended to apply to the whole of Russia.
Cases do occur when it is possible “right from the beginning” to carry on political agitation “exclusively on an economic basis”; and yet Rabocheye Dyelo went so far as to say that “there is no need for this whatever.
” (Two Congresses, p.
economic struggle “is the most widely applicable method” of drawing the masses into the political struggle? It is absolutely untrue.
All and sundry manifestations of police tyranny and autocratic outrage, in addition to the evils connected with the economic struggle, are equally “widely applicable” as a means of “drawing in” the masses.
The tyranny of the Zemsky Nacbal-niks,1 the flogging of the peasantry, the corruption of the officials, the conduct of the police towards the “common people” in the cities, the fight against tlie famine-stricken and the suppression of the popular striving towards enlightenment and knowledge, the extortion of taxes, the persecution of the religious sects, the harsh discipline in the army, the militarist conduct towards the students and the liberal intelligentsia—all these and a thousand other similar manifestations of tyranny, though not directly connected with the “economic” struggle, do they, in general, represent a less “widely applicable” method and subject for political agitation and for drawing the masses into the political struggle? The very opposite is the case.
Of all the innumerable cases in which the workers suffer (cither personally or those closely associated with them) from tyranny, violence and lack of rights, undoubtedly only a relatively few represent cases of police tyranny in the economic struggle as such.
Why then should we, beforehand, restrict the scope of political agitation by declaring only one of the methods to be “the most widely ap­ plicable,” when Social Democrats have other, generally speaking, not less “widely applicable” means? The League attaches significance to the fact that it replaced the phrase “most widely applicable method” by the phrase “a better method,” contained in one of the resolutions of the Fourth Congress of the Jewish Labour league (Bund).
* We confess that we find it difficult to say which of these resolutions 11.
) In the next chapter, we shall show that the tactics of the “poli­ ticians” and revolutionaries not only do not ignore the trade union tasks of Social-Democracy, but that, on the contrary, they alone can secure the consistent fulfilment of these tasks.
1 Officials, usually members of the nobility, who exercised administrative and judicial authority over the peasant population for the purpose of keeping them in subjection to the landlords.

is the better one.
In our opinion both are “worse” Both the League and the Bund fall into the error (partly, perhaps, un­ consciously, owing to the influence of tradition) of giving an economic, trade unionist interpretation to politics.
The fact that this error is expressed either by the word “better” or by the words “most widely applicable” makes no material difference whatever.
If the League had said that “political agitation on an economic basis” is the most widely applied (and not “applic­ able”) method it would have been right in regard to a certain period in the development of our Social-Democratic movement.
It would have been right in regard to the Economists and to many (if not the majority) of the practical workers of 1898-1901 who applied the method of political agitation (to the extent that they applied it at all) almost exclusively on an economic basis.
Political agitation on such lines was recognised and, as we have seen, even recommended by Rabochaya Mysl and by the Self-Emancipation group! Rabocheye Dyelo should have strong­ ly condemned the fact that useful economic agitation was accom­ panied by the harmful restriction of the political struggle, but instead of that, it declares the method most widely applied (by the Economists) to be the most widely applicable*.
What real concrete meaning does Martynov attach to the task of “giving the economic struggle itself a political character,” which he presents to Social-Democracy? The economic strug­ gle is the collective struggle of the workers against their employers for better terms in the sale of their labour power, for better conditions of life and labour.
This struggle is neces­ sarily a struggle according to trade, because conditions of labour differ very much in different trades, and, consequently, the fight to improve these conditions can only be conducted in respect of each trade (trade unions in the western countries, temporary trade associations and leaflets in Russia, etc.
).
Giving “the economic struggle itself a political character” means, therefore, striving to secure satisfaction for these trade demands, the im­ provement of conditions of labour in each separate trade by means of “legislative and administrative measures” (as Martynov ex­ presses it on the next page of his article, p.
43).
This is exactly 6 Lenin II what the trade unions do and always have done.
Read the works of the thoroughly scientific (and ‘'thoroughly” opportunist) Mr.
and Mrs.
Webb and you will find that the British trade unions long ago recognised, and have long carried out, the task of “giving the economic struggle itself a political character”; they have long been fighting for the right to strike, for the removal of all legal hindrances to the co-operative and trade union movement, for laws protecting women and children, for the im­ provement of conditions of labour by means of health and factory legislation, etc.
Thus, the pompous phrase “giving the economic struggle itself a political character,” which sounds so “terrifically” pro­ found and revolutionary, serves as a screen to conceal what is in fact the traditional striving to degrade Social-Democratic politics to the Ifcvel of trade union politics! On the pretext of rectifying Iskras onc-sidedness, which, it is alleged, places “the revolutionising of dogma higher than the revolutionising of life,” 1 we are presented with the struggle for economic reform as if it were something entirely new.
As a matter of fact, the phrase “giving the economic struggle itself a political charac­ ter” means nothing more than the struggle for economic reforms.
And Martynov himself might have come to this simple conclu­ sion had he only pondered over the significance of his own words.
“Our Party,” he says, turning his heaviest guns against Iskra, “could and should have presented concrete demands to the government for legis­ lative and administrative measures against economic exploitation, for the relief of unemployment, for the relief of the famine-stricken, etc.
” (Rabo­ cheye Dyclo, No.
10, pp.
4243.
) Concrete demands for measures—does not this mean demands for social reforms? And again we ask the impartial reader, do we slander the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists (may I be forgiven for 1 Rabocheye Dyelo, No.
10, p.
60.
This is the Martynov variation of the application to the present chaotic state of our movement of the thesis: “A step forward of the real movement is more important than a dozen programmes,” to which we have already referred above.
As a matter of fact, this is merely a translation into Russian of the notori­ ous Bemsteinian phrase: “The movement is everything, the ultimate aim !3 nothing.
” tliis clumsy expression!), when we declare them to be concealed Bernsteinists for advancing their thesis about the necessity of fighting for economic reforms as their point of disagreement with Iskra? Revolutionary Social-Democracy always included, and now includes, the fight for reforms in its activities.
But it utilises “economic” agitation for the purpose of presenting to the gov­ ernment, not only demands for all sorts of measures, but also (and primarily) the demand that it cease to be an autocratic government.
Moreover, it considers it to be its duty to present this demand to the government, not on the basis of the economic struggle alone, but on the basis of all manifestations of public and political life.
In a word, it subordinates the struggle for reforms to the revolutionary struggle for liberty and for social­ ism, as die part is subordinate to the whole.
Martynov, how­ ever, resuscitates the theory of stages in a new form, and strives to prescribe an exclusively economic, so to speak, path of de­ velopment for the political struggle.
By coming out at this mo­ ment, when the revolutionary movement is on the up-grade, with an alleged special “task” of fighting for reforms, he is dragging the Party backwards and is playing into the hands of both “economic” and liberal opportunism.
To proceed.
Shamefacedly hiding the struggle for reforms be­ hind the pompous thesis “giving the economic struggle itself a political character,” Martynov advanced, as if it ivere a special point, exclusively economic (in fact, exclusively factory) re-forms.
Why he did that, we do not knowr.
Perhaps it was due to carelessness? But if, indeed, he had something else besides “factory” reforms in mind, then the whole of his thesis, which we have just quoted.
loses all sense.
Perhaps he did it because he thought it possible and probable that the government would make “concessions” only in the economic sphere? 1 If that is what he thought, then it is a strange error.
Concessions are also 1P.

“Of course, when we advise the workers to present certain economic demands to the government, we do so because in the economic sphere, the autocratic government is compelled to agree to make certain concessions.
“ 6* possible and are made in the sphere of legislation concerning flogging, passports, land compensation payments, religious sects, the censorship, etc.
, etc.
“Economic” concessions (or pseudo­ concessions) are, of course, the cheapest and most advantageous concessions to make from the government’s point of view, be­ cause by these means it hopes to win the confidence of the masses of the workers.
For this very reason, we Social-Demo­ crats must under no circumstances create grounds for the belief (or the misunderstanding) that we attach greater value to econ­ omic reforms, or that we regard them as being particularly im­ portant, etc, “Such demands,” writes Martynov, concerning the concrete demands for legislative and administrative measures re­ ferred to above, “would not be merely a hollow sound, because, promising certain palpable results, they might be actively sup­ ported by the masses of the workers.
.
.
We are not Economists, oh no! We only cringe as slavishly before the “palpableness” of concrete results as do the Bernsteins, the Prokopoviches, the Struves, the R.
M.
’s, and tutti quantil We only wish to make it understood (with Narcissus Tuporylov1) that all that which “does not promise palpable results” is merely a “hollow sound.
” We are only trying to argue as if the masses of the workers were in­ capable (and had not already proved their capabilities, notwith­ standing those who ascribe their own philistinism to them) of actively supporting every protest against the autocracy even if it promises absolutely no palpable results whatever I “In addition to its immediate revolutionary significance, the economic struggle of the workers against the employers and the government V4 economic struggle against the government”!!] has also this significance: that it constantly brings the workers face to face with their own lack of political rights.

44.
) We quote this passage not in order to repeat what has already been said hundreds and thousands of times before, but in order to thank Martynov for this excellent new formula: “the workers’ economic struggle against the employers and the 1 The nom de plume adopted by J.

government.
” What a pearl! With what inimitable talent and skill in eliminating all partial disagreements and shades of dif­ ferences among Economists does this clear and concise postu­ late express the quintessence of Economism: from calling to the workers to join “in the political struggle which they carry on in the general interest, for the purpose of improving the conditions of all the workers,”1 continuing through the theory of stages, to the resolution of the Congress on the “most widely appli­ cable,” etc.
“Economic struggle against the government” is pre­ cisely trade union politics, which is very, very far from being Social-Democratic politics.

A Tale of How Martynov Rendered Plekhanov More Profound Martynov says: “Much water has flowed under the bridge since Plekhanov wrote this book.
” (Tasks of the Socialists in the Fight Against the Famine in Russia.
) “The Social-Democrats who for a decade led the economic struggle of the working class .
.
.
have failed as yet to lay down a broad theoretical basis for Party tactics.
This question has now come to the fore, and if we should wish to lay down such a theoretical basis we would certainly have considerably to deepen the principles of tactics that Plekhanov at one time developed.
.
.
.
We would now have to define the differences between propaganda and agitation differ­ ently from the way in which Plekhanov defined it.
[Martynov had just previously quoted the words of Plekhanov: “A propagandist presents many ideas to one or a few persons; an agitator presents only one or a few ideas, but he presents them to a mass of people.
1* 1 By propaganda we would understand the revolutionary elucidation of the whole of the present system or partial manifestations of it, irrespective of whether it is done in a form capable of being understood by individuals or by the broad masses.
By agitation, in the strict sense of the word fsic?], we would understand calling the masses to certain concrete actions that would facilitate the direct revolutionary intervention of the proletariat in social life.
** We congratulate Russian and international Social-Democracy on Martynov’s new, more strict and more profound terminology.
Up to now we thought (with Plekhanov, and with all the leaders of the international labour movement) that a propagandist, dealing with, say, the question of unemployment, must explain the capitalistic nature of crises, the reasons why crises are in-1 Rabochaya Mysl, Special Supplement, p.

evitable in modern society, must describe how present society must inevitably become transformed into socialist society, etc.
In a word, he must present “many ideas,” so many indeed that they will be understood as a whole only by a (comparatively) few persons.
An agitator, however, speaking on the same subject will take as an illustration a fact that is most widely known and outstanding among his audience, say, the death from starva­ tion of the family of an unemployed worker, the growing im­ poverishment, etc.
, and utilising this fact, which is known to all and sundry, will direct all his efforts to presenting a single idea to the “masses,” i.
e.
, the idea of the senseless contradiction be­ tween the increase of wealth and increase of poverty; he will strive to rouse discontent and indignation among the masses against this crying injustice, and leave a more complete ex­ planation of this contradiction to the propagandist.
Consequent­ ly, the propagandist operates chiefly by means of the printed word; the agitator operates with the living word.
The qualities that arc required of an agitator are not the same as the quali­ ties that are required of a propagandist.
Kautsky and Lafargue, for example, we call propagandists; Bebel and Guesde we call agitators.
To single out a third sphere, or third function, of practical activity, and to include in this third function “calling the masses to certain concrete actions,” is sheer nonsense, be­ cause the “call,” as a single act, either naturally and inevitably supplements the theoretical tract, propagandist pamphlet and agitational speech, or represents a purely executive function.
Take, for example, the struggle now being carried on by the German Social-Democrats against the grain duties.
The theoreti­ cians write works of research on »tariff policy and “call,” say, for a fight for commercial treaties and for free trade.
The propa­ gandist does the same thing in the periodical press, and the agitator does it in public speeches.
At the present time, the “con­ crete action” of the masses takes the form of signing petitions to the Reichstag against the raising of the grain duties.
The call for this action comes directly from the theoreticians, die propa­ gandists and the agitators, and, indirectly, from those workers who carry the petition lists to the factories and to private houses to get signatures.
According to the “Martynov terminolo­ gy/’ Kautsky and Bebel are both propagandists, while those who carry the petition lists around are agitators; is that not so? The German example recalled to my mind the German word Verballhornung, which literally translated means “to Ballhorn.
0 Johann Ballhorn, a Leipzig publisher of the sixteenth century, published a child’s reader in which, as was the custom, he in­ troduced a drawing of a cock; but this drawing, instead of portraying an ordinary cock with spurs, portrayed it without spurs and with a couple of eggs lying near it.
On the cover of this reader he printed the legend “Revised edition by Johann Ballhorn.
” Since that time the Germans describe any “revision” that is really a worsening as “Ballhorning.
” And watching Mar­ tynov’s attempts to render Plekhanov “more profound” involun­ tarily recalls Ballhorn to one’s mind.
.
.
.
Why did our Martynov “invent” this confusion? In order to illustrate how Iskra “devotes attention only to one side of the case, just as Plekhanov did a decade and a half ago.
” “Accord­ ing to Iskra, propagandist tasks force agitational tasks into the background, at least for the present.
” If we translate this last postulate from the language of Martynov into ordinary human language (because humanity has not yet managed to learn the newly invented terminology), we shall get the following: “Ac­ cording to Iskra, the tasks of political propaganda and political agitation force into the background the task of ‘presenting to the government concrete demands for legislative and adminis­ trative measures’ that promise certain palpable results” (or de­ mands for social reforms, that is, if we are permitted just once again to employ the old terminology of old humanity, which has not yet grown to Martynov’s level).
We suggest that the reader compare this thesis with the following tirade: **What astonishes us in these programmes [the programmes advanced by revolutionary Social-Democrats] is the constant stress that is laid upon the benefits of labour activity in parliament (non-existent in Russia) and the manner in which (thanks to their revolutionary nihilism) the importance of workers participating in the Government Advisory Commit­ tees on Factory Affairs (which do exist in Russia) .
.
.
or at least the importance of workers participating in municipal bodies is completely ignored.
.

.

Political Exposures and “Training in Revolutionary Activity” In advancing against Iskra his “theory” of “raising the act­ ivity of the masses of the workers,” Martynov, as a matter of fact, displayed a striving to diminish this activity, because he declared the very economic struggle before which all Econom­ ists grovel to be the preferable, the most important and “the most widely applicable” means of rousing this activity, and the widest field for it.
Ibis error is such a characteristic one, pre­ cisely because it is not peculiar to Martynov alone.
As a matter of fact, it is possible to “raise the activity of the masses of the workers” only provided this activity is not restricted entirely to “political agitation on an economic basis.
” And one of the fundamental conditions for the necessary expansion of political agitation is the organisation of all-sided political exposure.
In no other way can the masses be trained in political conscious­ ness and revolutionary activity except by means of such ex­ posures.
Hence, to conduct such activity is one of the most im­ portant functions of international Social-Democracy as a whole, for even the existence of political liberty does not remove the necessity for such exposures; it merely changes the sphere against which they are directed.
For example, the German Party is strengthening its position and spreading its influence, thanks particularly to the untiring energy with which it is conducting a campaign of political exposure.
Working class consciousness cannot be genuinely political consciousness unless the workers are trained to respond to all cases of tyranny, oppression, vio­ lence and abuse, no matter what class is affected.
Moreover, that response must be a Social-Democratic response, and not one from any other point of view.
The consciousness of the masses of the workers cannot be genuine class consciousness, unless the workers learn to observe from concrete, and above all from topical, political facts and events, every other social class and all the manifestations of the intellectual, ethical and polit­ ical life of these classes; unless they learn to apply practically the materialist analysis and the materialist estimate of all as­ pects of the life and activity of all classes, strata and groups of the population.
Those who concentrate the attention, observa­ tion and the consciousness of the working class exclusively, or even mainly, upon itself alone are not Social-Democrats; be­ cause, for its self-realisation the working class must not only have a theoretical • .
.
rather it would be more true to say .
♦ .
not so much a theoretical as a practical understanding, acquired through experience of political life, of the relationships between all the various classes of modern society.
That is why the idea preached by our Economists, that the economic struggle is the most widely applicable means of drawing the masses into the political movement, is so extremely harmful and extremely re­ actionary in practice.
In order to become a Social-Democrat, a workingman must have a clear picture in his mind of the economic nature and the social and political features of the landlord, of the priest, of the high state official and of the peas­ ant, of the student and of the tramp; he must know their strong and weak sides; he must understand all the catchwords and sophisms by which each class and each stratum camouflages its selfish strivings and its real “nature”; he must understand what interests certain institutions and certain laws reflect and how they reflect them.
This “clear picture” cannot be obtained from books.
It can be obtained only from living examples and from exposures, following hot after their occurrence, of what goes on around us at a given moment, of what is being dis­ cussed, in whispers perhaps, by each one in his own way, of the meaning of such and such events, of such and such statistics, of such and such court sentences, etc.
, etc.
, etc.
These universal political exposures are an essential and fundamental condition for training the masses in revolutionary activity.
Why is it that the Russian workers as yet display so little revolutionary activity in connection with the brutal way in which the police maltreat the people, in connection with the persecution of the religious sects, with the flogging of the peas­ antry, with the outrageous censorship, with the torture of sold­ iers, with the persecution of the most innocent cultural enter­ prises, etc.
? Is it because the “economic struggle” does not “stimulate” them to this, because such political activity does not “promise palpable results,” because it produces little that is “positive”? No.
To advance this argument, we repeat, is merely to shift the blame to the shoulders of others, to blame the masses of the workers for our own philistinism (also Bemsteinism).
We must blame ourselves, our remoteness from the mass move­ ment; we must blame ourselves for being unable as yet to org­ anise a sufficiently wide, striking and rapid exposure of these despicable outrages.
When we do that (and we must and can do it), the most backward worker will understand, or will feel, that the students and religious sects, the muzhiks and the au­ thors are being abused and outraged by the very same dark forces that are oppressing and crushing him at every step of his life, and, feeling that, he liimself will be filled with an ir­ resistible desire to respond to these things and then he will organise cat-calls against the censors one day, another day he will demonstrate outside the house of the provincial governor who has brutally suppressed a peasant uprising, another day he will teach a lesson to the gendarmes in surplices who are doing the work of the Holy Inquisition, etc.
As yet we have done very little, almost nothing, to hurl universal and fresh exposures among Hie masses of the workers.
Many of us as yet do not appreciate the bounden duty that rests upon us, but spon­ taneously follow in the wake of the “drab every-day struggle,” in the narrow confines of factory life.
Under such circumstances to say that “Iskra displays a tendency to belittle the significance of the forward march of the drab every-day struggle in com­ parison with the propaganda of brilliant and complete ideas” (Martynov, p.
61)—means dragging the Parly backward, de­ fending and glorifying our unpreparedness and backwardness.
As for calling the masses to action, that will come of itself immediately energetic political agitation, live and striking ex­ posures are set going.
To catch some criminal red-handed and immediately to brand him publicly will have far more effect than any number of "appeals”; the effect very often will be such as will make it impossible to tell exactly who it was that “appealed” to the crowd, and exactly who suggested this or that plan of demonstration, etc.
Calls for action, not in the general, but in the concrete sense of the term, can be made only at the place of action; only those who themselves go into action im­ mediately can make appeals for action.
And our business as Social-Democratic publicists is to deepen, to expand and in­ tensify political exposures and political agitation.
A word in passing about “calls to action.
” The only paper that prior to the spring events called upon the workers actively to intervene in a matter that certainly did not promise any palpable results for the workers, i.
e.
, the drafting of the students into the army, was Iskra.
Immediately after the publication of the order of January 11, on “drafting the 183 students into the army,” Iskra published an article about it (in its February is­ sue, No.
2), and before any demonstration was started openly called upon “the workers to go to the aid of the students,” called upon the “people” boldly to take up the government’s open challenge.
We ask: how is the remarkable fact to be explained that although he talks so much about “calls to action,” and even suggests “calls to action” as a special form of activity, Martynov said not a word about this call? Our Economists, including Rabocheye Dyelo, were successful because they pandered to the uneducated workers.
But the working class Social-Democrat, the working class revolution­ ary (and the number of that type is growing) will indignantly reject all this talk about fighting for demands “promising palp­ able results,” etc.
, because he will understand that this is only a variation of the old song about adding a kopek to the ruble.
Such a workingman will say to his counsellors of Rabochaya Mysl and Rabocheye Dyelox you are wasting your time, gentle­ men; you are interfering with excessive zeal in a job that we can manage ourselves, and you are neglecting your own duties.
It is silly of you to say that the Social-Democrats’ task is to give the economic struggle itself a political character, for that is only the beginning, it is not the main task that Social-Demo­ crats must fulfil.
All over the world, including Russia, the police themselves often give the economic struggle a political charac­ ter, and the workers themselves are beginning to understand whom the government supports.
1 The “economic struggle of the workers against the employers and the government,” about which you make as much fuss as if you had made a new discovery, is be­ ing carried on in all parts of Russia, even the most remote, by the workers themselves who have heard about strikes, but who have heard almost nothing about socialism.
The “activity” you want to stimulate among us workers, by advancing concrete demands promising palpable results, we are already displaying and in our every-day, petty trade union work we put forward concrete demands, very often without any assistance whatever from the intellectuals.
But such activity is not enough for us; we are not children to be fed on the sops of “economic” politics alone; we want to know everything that everybody else knows, we want to learn the details of all aspects of political life and to take part actively in every political event.
In order that we may do this, the intellectuals must talk to us less of what we already know, and tell us more about what we do not know and wdiat we can never learn from our factory and “economic” ex-1 The demand “to give the economic struggle itself a «political char­ acter” most strikingly expresses subservience to spontaneity in the sphere of political activity.
Very often the economic struggle spontaneously assumes a political character, that is to say, without the injection of the “revolutionary bacilli of the intelligentsia.
” without the intervention of the class conscious Social-Democrats.
For example, the economic strug­ gle of the British workers assumed a political character without the intervention of the Socialists.
The tasks of the Social-Democrats, how­ ever, are not exhausted by political agitation in the economic field; their task is to convert trade union politics into the Social-Democratic political struggle, to utilise the flashes of political consciousness which gleam in the minds of the workers during their economic struggles for the purpose of raising them to the level of Social-Democratic political consciousness.
The Martynovs, however, instead of raising and stimulat­ ing the spontaneously awakening political consciousness of the workers, bow down before spontaneity and repeat over and over again, until one is sick and tired of hearing it, that the economic struggle “stimulates” in the workers* minds thoughts about their own lack of political rights.
It is unfortunate, gentlemen, that the spontaneously awakening trade union political consciousness does not “stimulate” in your minds thoughts about your Social-Democratic tusks! perience, that is, you must give us political knowledge.
You intellectuals can acquire this knowledge, and it is your duty to bring us this knowledge in a hundred and a thousand times greater measure than you have done up to now; and you must bring us this knowledge, not only in the form of arguments, pamphlets and articles which sometimes—excuse our frank­ ness!—are very dull, but in the form of live exposures of what our government and our governing classes are doing at this very moment in all spheres of life.
Fulfil this duty with greater zeal, and talk less about ”increasing the activity of the masses of the workers' ’! We are far more active than you think, and we are quite able to support, by open street fighting, demands that do not promise any “palpable results” whatever! You cannot “in­ crease” our activity, because you yourselves are not sufficiently active.
Be less subservient to spontaneity, and think more about increasing your own activity, gentlemen! 1 1 To prove that this imaginary speech of a worker to an Economist is based on fact, we shall call two witnesses who undoubtedly have direct knowledge of the labour movement, and who can be least sus­ pected of being partial towards us “doctrinaires,” for one witness Is an Economist (who regards even Rabocheye Dy do as a political organ!), and the other is a terrorist The first witness is the author of a remark­ ably truthful and lively article entitled “The St Petersburg Labour Movement and the Practical Tasks of Social-Democracy,” published in Rabocheye Dyelo, No.

He divided the workers into the following categories: 1.
class conscious revolutionaries.
2.
intermediate stratum; 3.
the masses.
Now the intermediate stratum he says “is often more inter­ ested in questions of political life than in its own immediate economic in­ terests, the connection between which and the general social conditions it has long understood.

the younger and more sensitive section of the workers, less corrupted by the tavern and the church, who have hardly ever had the opportunity of read­ ing political literature, discusses political events in a rambling way and ponders deeply over the fragmentary news it gets about the student riots, etc.

What is There in Common Between Economise and Terrorism? In the last footnote we quoted the opinion of an Economist and of a non-Social-Democratic terrorist who, by chance, proved to be in agreement with him.
Speaking generally, however, be­ tween the two there is not an accidental, but a necessary, in­ herent connection, about which we shall have to speak further on, but which must be dealt with here in connection with the ques­ tion of training the masses in revolutionary activity.
The Econ­ omists and the modern terrorists spring from a common root, namely, subservience to spontaneity, which we dealt with in the preceding chapter as a general phenomenon, and which we shall now examine in relation to its effect upon political activity and the political struggle.
At first sight, our assertion may appear paradoxical, for the difference between these two appears to be so enormous: one stresses the “drab every-day struggle” and the other calls for the most self-sacrificing struggle of individuals.
But this is not a paradox.
The Economists and terrorists merely bow to different poles of spontaneity: the Economists bow to the spontaneity of the “pure and simple” labour movement, while the terrorists bow to the spontaneity of the passionate indignation of the intellectuals, who are either incapable of linking up the rev­ olutionary struggle with the labour movement, or lack the op­ portunity to do so.
It is very difficult indeed for those who have lost their belief, or who have never believed that this is possible, to find some other outlet for their indignation and revolutionary energy than terror.
Thus, both the forms of subservience to spon­ taneity we have mentioned are nothing more nor less than a be* ginning in the carrying out of the notorious Credo programme.
Let the workers carry on their “economic struggle against the employers and the government” (we apologise to the author of the Credo for expressing his views in Martynov’s words! But we think we have the right to do so because even the Credo says that in the economic struggle the workers “come up against the po­ litical regime”), and let the intellectuals conduct the political struggle by their own efforts—with the aid of terror, of course! This is an absolutely logical and inevitable conclusion which must be insisted upon—even though those who are beginning to carry out this programme did not themselves realise that it is inevitable.
Political activity has its logic quite apart from the consciousness of those who, with the best intentions, call either for terror or for giving the economic struggle itself a political character.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions, and, in tliis case, good intentions cannot save one from being spon­ taneously drawn “along the line of least resistance,” along the line of die purely bourgeois Credo programme.
Surely it is not an accident that many Russian liberals—avowed liberals and liberals who wear the mask of Marxism—wholeheartedly sym­ pathise with terror and strive to foster the spirit of terrorism that is running so high at the present time.
* The formation of the Svoboda Revolutionary Socialist group **—which was formed with the object of giving all pos­ sible assistance to the labour movement, but which included in its programme terror, and emancipation, so to speak, from So­ cial-Democracy—this fact once again confirmed the remarkable penetration of P.
B.
Axelrod who literally foretold these results of Social-Democratic wavering as far back as the end of 1897 (Modern Tasks and Modern Tactics), when he outlined his re­ markable “two prospects.
”*** All the subsequent disputes and disagreements among Russian Social-Democrats are contained, like a plant in the seed, in these two prospects.
1 1 Martynov “conceives of another, more realistic (?) dilemma” (Social-Democracy and the JT or king Class, p.
19): “Either SociahDemocracy undertakes the direct leadership of the economic struggle of the prole­ tariat and by that [11 transforms it into a revolutionary class strug­ gle.
.
.
” “by that,” i.
e.
, apparently die direct leadership of the econ­ omic struggle.
Can Martynov quote an example where the leadership of the industrial struggle alone has succeeded in transforming the trade union movement into a revolutionary class movement? Cannot he under­ stand that in order to “transform” we must undertake the “direct leadership” of all-sided political agitation? .
Or the other prospect: Social Democracy refrains from taking the leadership of the economic struggle of the workers and so .
.
.
clips its own wings.
.
.
.
” In Raboch-cye Dyelo's opinion, which we quoted above, Iskra “refrains.
” We have seen, however, that the latter does far more to lead the economic struggle than Rabocheyc Dyelo, but it does not confine itself to this, and does not curtail its political tasks for the sake of it.
From this point of view it will be clear that Rabocheye Dyelo> being unable to withstand the spontaneity of Economism, has been unable also to withstand the spontaneity of terrorism.
It would be interesting to note here the specific arguments that Svoboda advanced in defence of terrorism.
It “completely denies” the deterrent role of terrorism (The Regeneration of Revolutionism, p.
64), but instead stresses its “excitative signi­ ficance.
” This is characteristic, first, as representing one of the stages of the break-up and decay of the traditional (pre-Social-Democratic) cycle of ideas which insisted upon terrorism.
To admit now that the government cannot be “terrified,” and there­ fore disrupted, by terror, is tantamount to condemning terror as a system of struggle, as a sphere of activity sanctioned by the programme.
Secondly, it is still more characteristic as an ex­ ample of the failure to understand our immediate task of “train­ ing die masses in revolutionary activity.
” Svoboda advocates terror as a means of “exciting” the labour movement, and of giving it a “strong impetus.
” It is difficult to imagine an argu­ ment that disproves itself more than this one does! Are there not enough outrages committed in Russian life that a special “stimulant” has to be invented? On the other hand, is it not obvious that those who are not, and cannot be, roused to excite­ ment even by Russian tyranny will stand by “twiddling their thumbs” even while a handful of terrorists are engaged in single combat with the government? The fact is, however, that the masses of the workers are roused to a high pitch of excite­ ment by the outrages committed in Russian life, but we are un­ able to collect, if one may put it that way, and concentrate all these drops and streamlets of popular excitement, which are called forth by the conditions of Russian life to a far larger ex­ tent than we imagine, but which it is precisely necessary to com­ bine into a single gigantic flood.
That this can be accomplished is irrefutably proved by the enormous growth of the labour move­ ment, and the greed with which the workers devour political literature, to which we have already referred above.
Calls for terror and calls to give the economic struggle itself a political character are merely two different forms of evading the most pressing duty that now rests upon Russian revolutionaries, name­ ly, to organise all-sided political agitation.
Svoboda desires to substitute terror for agitation, openly admitting that “as soon as intensified and strenuous agitation is commenced among the masses its excitative function will be finished/’ (The Regener­ ation of Revolutionism, p.
68.
) This proves precisely that both the terrorists and the Economists underestimate the revolution­ ary activity of the masses, in spite of the striking evidence of the events that took place in the spring,1 and whereas one goes out in search of artificial “stimulants,” the other talks about “con­ crete demands.
” But both fail to devote sufficient attention to the development of their own activity in political agitation and org­ anisation of political exposures.
And no other work can serve as a substitute for this work either at the present time or at any other time.
E.
The Working Class as Champion of Democracy We have seen that the carrying on of wide political agitation, and consequently the organisation of all-sided political expo­ sures, is an absolutely necessary and paramount task of activity, that is, if that activity is to be truly Social-Democratic.
We ar­ rived at this conclusion solely on the grounds of the pressing needs of the working class for political knowledge and political training.
But this presentation of the question is too narrow, for it ignores the general democratic tasks of Social-Democracy in general, and of modern Russian Social-Democracy in particular.
In order to explain the situation more concretely we shall ap­ proach the subject from an aspect that is “nearer” to the Econ­ omist, namely, from the practical aspect.
“Everyone agrees” that it is necessary to develop the political consciousness of the working class.
But the question arises, how is that to be done? What must be done to bring this about? The economic struggle merely brings the workers “up against” questions concerning the attitude of the government towards the working class.
Con­ sequently, however much we may try to give the “economic 1 This refers to the big street demonstrations which commenced in the spring of 1901.

} 1 Lenin U struggle itself a political character” we shall never be able to develop the political consciousness of the workers (to the de­ gree of Social-Democratic consciousness) by confining ourselves to the economic struggle, for the limits of this task are too nar­ row.
The Martynov formula has some value for us, not because it illustrates Martynov’s ability to confuse things, but because it strikingly expresses the fundamental error that all the Econ­ omists commit, namely, their conviction that it is possible to develop the class political consciousness of the workers from within the economic struggle, so to speak, i.

, making the econ­ omic struggle the exclusive, or, at least, the main starting point, making the economic struggle the exclusive, or, at least, the main basis.
Such a view is radically wrong.
Piqued by our opposition to them, the Economists refuse to ponder deeply over the origins of these disagreements, with the result that we absolutely fail to understand each other.
It is as if we spoke in different tongues.
Class political consciousness can be brought to the workers only from without, that is, only outside of the economic struggle, outside of the sphere of relations between workers and employers.
The sphere from which alone it is possible to obtain this knowledge is the sphere of relationships between all the various classes and strata and the state and the government—the sphere of the interrelations between all the various classes.
For that reason, the reply to the question: wdiat must be done in or­ der to bring political knowledge to the workers? cannot he mere­ ly the one which, in the majority of cases, the practical work­ ers, especially those w'ho are inclined towards Economism, usually content themselves with, i.
e.
, “go among the workers.
” To bring political knowledge to the workers the Social-Dem­ ocrats must go among all classes of the population, must despatch units of their army in all directions.
We deliberately select this awkwrard formula, we deliberately express ourselves in a -simple, forcible way, not because we desine to indulge in paradoxes, but in order to “stimulate” the Economists to take up their tasks which they unpardonably ignore, to make them understand die difference between trade union and Social-Democratic politics, which they refuse to un­ derstand.
Therefore, we beg the /reader not to get excited, but to listen patiently to the end.
Take the type of Social-Democratic circle that has been most widespread during the past few years, and examine its work.
It has “contacts with the workers,” it issues leaflets—in which abuses in the factories, the government’s partiality towards the capitalists and the tyranny of the police are strongly con­ demned—and it rests content with this.
At meetings of workers the discussions never, or rarely, go beyond the limits of these subjects.
Lectures and discussions on the history of the revolu­ tionary movement, on questions of the home and foreign policy of our government, on questions of the economic evolution of Russia and of Europe, and the position of the various classes in modern society, etc.
, are extremely rare.
Of systematically ac­ quiring and extending contact with other classes of society, no one even dreams.
The ideal leader, as the majority of the mem­ bers of such circles picture him, is something more in the nature of a trade union secretary than a Socialist political leader.
Any trade union secretary, an English one for instance, helps the workers to conduct the economic struggle, helps to expose factory abuses, explains the injustice of the laws and of measures which hamper the freedom to strike and the freedom to picket (i.
e.
, to warn all and sundry that a strike is proceeding at a certain factory), explains the partiality of arbitration court judges who belong to the bourgeois classes, etc.
, etc.
In a word, every trade union secretary conducts and helps to conduct “the economic struggle against the employers and the government.
” It cannot be too strongly insisted that this is not enough to constitute So­ cial-Democracy.
The Social-Democrat’s ideal should not be a trade union secretary, but a tribune of the people, able to react to every manifestation of tyranny and oppression, no matter where it takes place, no mailer what stratum or class of the people it affects; he must be able to group all these manifest­ ations into a single picture of police violence and capitalist ex­ ploitation; he must be able to take advantage of every petty event in order to explain his socialistic convictions and his Social-Democratic demands to all, in order to explain to all and everyone the world-historic significance of the struggle for the emancipation of the proletariat.
Compare, for example, a leader like Robert Knight (the celebrated secretary and leader of the Boiler-Makers’ Society, one of the most powerful trade unions in England) with Wilhelm Liebknecht, and then take the con­ trasts that Martynov draws in his controversy with Iskra.
You will see—1 am running through Martynov’s article—that Robert Knight engaged more in “calling the masses to certain concrete actions,” while Liebknecht engaged more in ‘’the revolutionary explanation of the whole of modern society, or various mani­ festations of it”; that Robert Knight ‘‘formulated the immediate demands of the proletariat and pointed to the manner in which they can be achieved,” whereas W ilhelm Liebknecht, while doing this, “simultaneously guided the activities of various opposition strata,” “dictated to them a positive programme of action”1; that it was precisely Robert Knight who strove “as far as pos­ sible to give the economic struggle itself a political character” and was excellently able “to submit to the government concrete demands promising certain palpable results,” while Liebknecht engaged more in “one-sided exposures”; that Robert Knight at­ tached more significance to the “forward march of the drab, every-day struggle,” while Liebknecht attached more significance to the “propaganda of brilliant and finished ideas”; that Lieb­ knecht converted the paper he wras directing into “an organ of revolutionary opposition exposing the present system and par­ ticularly the political conditions which came into conflict with the interests of the most varied strata of the population,” where­ as Robert Knight “worked for the cause of labour in close or­ ganic contact with the proletarian struggle”—if by “close and organic contact” is meant the subservience to spontaneity which wc studied above from the example of Krichevsky and Marty­ nov—and “restricted the sphere of his influence,” convinced, of course, as is Martynov, that “by that he intensified that in­ 1 For example, during the Franco-Prussian War, Liebknecht dictated a programme oi action for the whole oj democracy—and thia was dune io an even greater extent by Marx and Engels in 1848, fluence.
” In a word, you will see that de facto Martynov re­ duces Social-Democracy to the level of trade unionism, and he does this, of course, not because he docs not desire the good of Social-Democracy, but simply because he is a little too much in a hurry to make Plekhanov more profound, instead of taking the trouble to understand him.
Let us return, however, to the elucidation of our thesis.
We said that a Social-Democrat, if he really believes it is necessary to develop the all-sided political consciousness of the proletari­ at, must “go among all classes of the people.
” This gives rise to the questions: How is this to be done? Have we enough forces to do this? Is there a base for such work among all the other classes? Will this not mean a retreat, or lead to a retreat, from the class point of view? We shall deal with these questions.
We must “go among all classes of the people” as theo­ reticians, as propagandists, as agitators and as organisers.
No one doubts that the theoretical work of Social-Demoorats should be directed towards studying all the features of the social and political position of the various classes.
But extremely little is done in this direction as compared with the work that is done in studying the features of factory life.
In the committees and circles, you will meet men who are immersed, say, in the study of some special branch of the metal industry, but you will hardly ever find members of organisations (obliged, as often happens, for some reason or other to give up practical work) especially engaged in the collection of material concerning some pressing question of social and political life which could serve as a means for conducting Social-Democratic work among other strata of the population.
In speaking of the lack of training of the majority of present-day leaders of the labour movement, we cannot refrain from mentioning the point about training in this connection also, for it too is bound up with the “economic” conception of “close organic contact with the proletarian strug­ gle.
” The principal thing, of course, is propaganda and agita­ tion among all strata of the people.
The West European So­ cial-Democrats find their work in this field facilitated by the calling of public meetings, to which all are free to go, and by the parliament, in which they speak to the representatives of all classes.
We have neither a parliament nor the freedom to call meetings, nevertheless we are able to arrange meetings of work­ ers who desire to listen to a Social-Democrat.
We must also find ways and means of calling meetings of representatives of all classes of the population that desire to listen to a democrat; for he who forgets that “the Communists support every revolution­ ary movement,” that we are obliged for that reason to expound and emphasise general democratic tasks before the whole people, without for a moment concealing our socialistic convictions, is not a Social-Democrat.
He who forgets his obligation to be in advance of everybody in bringing up, sharpening and solving every general democratic problem is not a Social-Democrat.
“But everybody agrees with this!”—the impatient reader will exclaim—and the new instructions given by the last Congress of the League to the editorial board of Rabochcye Dyelo say: “All events of social and political life that affect the proletariat either directly as a special class or as the vanguard of all the revolutionary forces in the struggle for freedom should serve as subjects for political propaganda and agitation.
” (Two Con­ gresses, p.
17, our italics.
) Yes.
these are very true and very good words and we would be satisfic'd if Rabochcye Dyelo un­ derstood them and if it refrained from saying in the next breath things that are the very opposite of them.
Ponder over the following piece of Martynov reasoning.
On page 4-0 he says that Iskras tactics of exposing abuses are one­ sided, that “however much we may spread distrust and hatred towards the government, we shall not achieve our aim until we have succeeded in developing sufficiently active social energy for its overthrow.
” This, it may be said in parenthesis, is the concern, with which we are already familiar, for increasing the activity of the masses, while at the same time striving to restrict one’s own activity.
This is not the point we are now discussing, however.
Martynov, therefore, speaks of revolutionary energy (“for overthrowing”).
But what conclusion does he arrive at? As in ordinary times, various social strata inevitably march separately.
‘Tn view of that, it is clear that we Social-Democrats cannot simul­ taneously guide the activities of various opposition strata, xve cannot dictate to them a positive programme of action, we cannot point out to them in what manner they can fight for their daily interests.
.
.
.
The liberal strata will themselves take care of the active struggle for their immediate interests and this struggle will bring them up against our political regime.
” (P.
41.
) Thus, having commenced by speaking of revolutionary energy, of the active struggle for the overthrow of die autocracy, Marty­ nov immediately turned towards trade union energy and active struggle for immediate interests! It goes without saying that we cannot guide the struggle of die students, liberals, etc.
, for their “immediate interests,” but this is not the point we are arguing about, most wordiy Economist! The point we are discussing is the possible and necessary participation of various social strata in the overthrow of the autocracy; not only are we able, but it is our duly, to guide these “activities of the various opposition strata” if we desire to be the “vanguard.
” Not only will the students and our liberals, etc.
, themselves take care of “the strug­ gle that will bring them up against our political regime”; the police and the officials of the autocratic government will see to this more than anyone else.
But if “we” desire to be advanced democrats, we must make it our business to stimulate in the minds of those who are dissatisfied only with university, or only with Zemstvo, etc.
, conditions the idea that the whole polit­ ical system is worthless.
We must take upon ourselves the task of organising a universal political struggle under the leadership of our Party in such a manner as to obtain all the support pos­ sible of all opposition strata for the struggle and for our Party.
We must train our Social-Democratic practical workers to be­ come political leaders, able to guide all the manifestations of this universal struggle, able at the right time to “dictate a posi­ tive programme of action” for the discontented students, for the discontented Zemstvo Councillors, for the discontented religious sects, for the offended elementary school teachers, etc.
, etc.
For that reason.
Martynov’s assertion—that “with regard to these, we can come forward merely in the negative role of exposers of abuses .
.
.
we can only [our italics] dissipate the hopes they have In various government commissions”—is absolutely wrong.
By saying this Martynov shows that he absolutely fails to under stand the role the revolutionary “vanguard” must really play.
If the reader bea^s this in mind, the real sense of the following concluding remarks by Martynov will be clear to him: “Iskra is the organ of the revolutionary opposition which exposes the abuses of our system, particularly political abuses, in so far as they affect the interests of the most diverse classes of the population.
We, however, are working and will continue to work for the cause of laboui in close organic contact with the nrolctarian struggle.
By restricting the sphere of our influence, we intensify that influence.
” The true sense of this conclusion is as follows: Iskra desires to elevate working class trade union politics (to which, owing to misunderstanding, lack of training, or by conviction, our practical workers frequently confine themselves) to Social-Demo­ cratic politics, whereas Rabocheye Dyelo desires to degrade So­ cial-Democratic politics «to trade union politics.
And while doing this, they assure the world that these two positions are “quite compatible in the common cause.
” O! Sanda simplicitas! To proceed.
Have we sufficient forces to be able to direct our propaganda and agitation among all classes of the population? Of course we have.
Our Economists are frequently inclined to deny this.
They lose sight of the gigantic progress our move­ ment has made from (approximately) 1894 to 1901.
Like real “khvostisfs” they frequently live in the distant past, in the period of the beginning of the movement.
At that time, indeed, we had astonishingly few forces, and it was perfectly natural and legitimate then to resolve to go exclusively among the workers, and severely condemn any deviation from this.
The whole task then was to consolidate our position in the working class.
At the present time, however, gigantic forces have been attracted to the movement; the best representatives of the young genera­ tion of the educated classes are coming over to us; all over the country there are people compelled to live in the provinces, who have taken part in the movement in the past and desire to do so now, who are gravitating towards Social-Democracy (in 1894 you could count the Social-Democrats on your fingers).
One of the principal political and organisational shortcomings of our movement is that we are unable to utilise all these forces and give them appropriate work (we shall deal with this in detail in the next chapter).
The overwhelming majority of these forces entirely lack the opportunity of “going among the workers,” so there are no grounds for fearing that we shall deflect forces from our main cause.
And in order to be able to provide the workers with real, universal and live polit­ ical knowledge, we must have “our own men,” Social-Demo­ crats, everywhere, among all social strata, and in all positions from which we can learn the inner springs of our state mechan­ ism.
Such men are required for propaganda and agitation, but in a still larger measure for organisation.
Is there scope for activity among all classes of the popula­ tion? Those who fail to see this also lag behind the spontaneous awakening of the masses as far as class consciousness is con­ cerned.
The labour movement has aroused and is continuing to arouse discontent in some, hopes for support for the opposition in others, and the consciousness of the intolcrablencss and in­ evitable downfall of autocracy in still others.
We would be “politicians” and Social-Democrats only in name (as very often happens), if we failed to realise that our task is to utilise every manifestation of discontent, and to collect and utilise every grain of even rudimentary protest.
This is quite anart from the fact that many millions of the peasantry, handicraftsmen, petty artisans, etc.
, always listen eagerly to the preachings of any Social-Democrat who is at all intelligent.
Is there a single class of the population in which no individuals, groups or circles are to be found who are discontented with the state of tvranny and.
therefore, accessible to the propaganda of Social-Democraits as the spokesmen of the most pressing general democratic needs? To those who desire to have a clear idea of what the political agitation of a Social-Dcmocrat among all classes and strata of the population should he like, we would point to political ex­ posures in the b'cad sense of the word as the principal (but of course not the sole) form of this agitation.
We must “arouse in every section of the population that is at all enlightened a passion for political exposure.
” I wrote in my article “Where to Begin?” (Iskra, No.
4, May 1901), with which I shall deal in greater detail later.
“We must not allow ourselves to be discouraged by the fact that the voice of political exposure is still feeble» rare and timid.
This is not because of a general submission to political despotism, but because those who are able and ready to expose have no tribune from which to speak, because there is no audience to listen eagerly to and approve of what the orators say, and because the latter do not see anywhere among the people forces to "whom it would be worth while directing their complaint against the ‘omnipotent* Russian government.
.
.
.
We are now in a position, and it is our duty, to set up a tribune for the national exposure of the tsarist government.
That tribune must be a Social-Democratic paper.
” 1 The ideal audience for these political exposures is the work­ ing class, which is first and foremost in need of universal and live political knowledge, which is most capable of converting this knowledge into active struggle, even if it does not promise “palpable results.
” The only platform from which public ex­ posures can be made is an all-Russian newspaper.
“Without a political organ, a political movement deserving that name is inconceivable in modern Europe.
” In this connection Russia must undoubtedly be included in modem Europe.
The press has long ago become a power in our country, otherwise the govern­ ment would not spend tens of thousands of rubles to bribe it, and to subsidise the Katkovs and Meshcherskys.
And it is no novelty in autocratic Russia for the underground press to break Hi rough the wall of censorship and compel the legal and con­ servative press to speak openly of it.
This was the case in the ’seventies and even in the ’fifties.
How much broader and deeper are now the strata of the people willing to read the illegal underground press, and to learn from it “how to live and how to die,” to use the expression of die worker who sent a letter to Iskra.
(No.
7.
) Political exposures are as much a declaration of war against the government as economic exposures are a dec­ laration of war against the employers.
And the wider and more powerful this campaign of exposure is, the more numerous and determined the social class, which has declared war in order to commence the war, will be, die greater will be the moral signi-1 Sec page 20 in this volume.

ficance of this declaration of war.
Hence, political exposures in themselves serve as a powerful instrument for disintegrating the system we oppose, the means for diverting from the enemy his casual or temporary allies, the means for spreading enmity and distrust among those who permanently share power with the autocracy.
Only a party that will organise real, public exposures can Become the vanguard of the revolutionary forces in our time.
The word “public” has a very profound meaning.
The overwhelming majority of the non-working class -exposers (and in order to become the vanguard, we must attract other classes) are sober politicians and coo! businessmen.
They know perfectly well how dangerous it is to “complain” even against a minor official, let alone against the “omnipotent” Russian government.
And they will come to us with their complaints only when they see that these complaints -really have -effect, and when they see that we represent a political force.
In order to become this political force in the eyes of outsiders, much persistent and stub­ born work is required to raise our own consciousness, initia­ tive and energy.
For this, it is not sufficient to stick the label “vanguard” on rearguard theory and practice.
But if we have to undertake the organisation of the real, public exposure of the government, in what way will the class character of our movement be expressed?—the over-zealous advocates of “close organic contact with the proletarian strug­ gle” will ask us.
The reply is: in that we Social-Democrats will organise these public exposures; in that all the questions that are brought up by the agitation will be explained in the spirit of Social-Democracy, without any concessions to deliberate or unconscious distortions of Marxism; in the fact that the Party will carry on this universal political agitation, uniting into one inseparable whole the pressure upon the government in the name of the whole people, the revolutionary training of the proletar­ iat—while preserving its political independence—the guidance of the economic struggle of the working class, the utilisation of all its spontaneous conflicts with its exploiters, which rouse and bring into our camp increasing numbers of -the proletariat.
But one of the characteristic features of Economism is its failure to understand this connection.
More than that—it fails to understand the identity of the most pressing needs of the proletariat (an all-sided political education through the medium of political agitation and political exposures) with the needs of the general democratic movement.
This lack of understanding i? not only expressed in “Martynovist” phrases, but also in the reference to tire class point of view which is identical in mean­ ing with these phrases.
The following, for example, is how the authors of the “economic” letter in No.
12 of Iskra expressed themselves.
1 “This fundamental drawback [overestimating ideology] is the cause of Iskra's inconsistency in regard to the question of the relations between Social-Democrats and various social classes and tendencies.
By a process of theoretical reasoning [and not by “the growth of Party tasks which grow together with the Party” 1, Iskra arrived at the conclusion that it was necessary immediately to take up the struggle against absolutism, but in all probability sensing the difficulty of this task for the workers in the present state of affairs [not only sensing, but knowing perfectly well that this problem would seem less difficult to the workers than to thoce Economist intellectuals who are concerned about little children, for the workers are prepared io fight even for demands which, to use the language of the never-to-be-forgotten Martynov, do not “promise palpable results’*] .
.
.
and lacking the patience to wait until the work­ ing class has accumulated forces for this struggle, Iskra begins to seek for allies in the ranks of the liberals and intelligentsia.
” Yes, yes, we have indeed lost all “patience” to “wait” for the blessed time that has long been promised us by the “concili­ ators,” when the Economists will stop throwing the blame for their own backwardness upon the workers, and stop justifying their own lack of energy by the alleged lack of forces among the workers.
We ask our Economists: what does “the working class accumulating forces for this struggle” mean? Is it not evident that it means the political training of the workers, revealing to 1 Lack of space has prevented us from replying in full, in Iskra, to this letter, which is extremely characteristic of the Economists.
We were very glad this letter appeared, for the charges brought acainst Iskra* that it did not maintain a consistent, class point of view, have reached us long ago from various sources, and we have been waiting for an ap­ propriate opportunity, or for a formulated expression of this fashionable charge, to reply to it.
And it is our habit to reply to attacks, not by de­ fence, but by counter attacks.
* them all the aspects of our despicable autocracy? And is it not clear that precisely for this work we need “allies in the ranks of the liberals and intelligentsia,” who are prepared to join us in the exposure of the political attack on the Zemstvo, on the teachers, on tihc statisticians, on the students, etc.
? Is this “cun ning mechanism” so difficult to understand after all? Has not P.
B.
Axelrod repeated to you over and over again since 1897: “The problem of the Russian Social-Democrats acquiring direct and indirect allies among the non-proletarian classes will be solved principally by the character of the propagandist activ­ ities conducted among the proletariat itself”? And Martynov and the other Economists continue to imagine that the workers must first accumulate forces (for trade union politics) “in the economic struggle against the employers and the government,” and then “go over” (we suppose from trade union “training for activity”) to Social-Democratic activity.
“.
.
.
In its quest,” continue the Economists, “Iskra not infrequently de­ parts from the class point of view, obscures class antagonisms and puts into the forefront the general character of the prevailing discontent with the government, notwithstanding the fact that the causes and the degree of this discontent vary very considerably among the ‘allies.
’ Such, for example, is Iskras attitude towards the Zemstvo.
.
.
Iskra, it is alleged, “promises the nobility, who are discontented with the government’s doles, the aid of the working class, but does not say a word about the class differences among these strata of the people.
” If the reader will turn to the series of ar­ ticles “The Autocracy and the Zemstvo” (Nos.
2 and 4 of Iskra), to which, in all probability, the author of the letter re­ fers, he will find that these articles 1 deal with the attitude of the government towards the “mild agitation of the feudal-bureau­ cratic Zemstvo,” and towards the “independent activity of even the propertied classes.
” In these articles it is stated that the workers cannot look on indifferently while the government is carrying on a fight against the Zemstvo, and the latter are called upon to give up making soft speeches, and to speak firmly and 1 And among these articles there was one (Iskra, No.
3) especially deal­ ing with the class antagonisms in the countryside.
[See “The Workers’ Party and the Peasantry” in this volume.
—Ed.
] resolutely when revolutionary Social-Democracy confronts the government in all its strength.
What there is in this that the authors of the letter do not agree with is not clear.
Do they think that the workers will ‘’not understand” the phrases ‘"propertied classes” and “feudal-bureaucratic Zemstvo”? Do they think that stimulating the Zemstvo to abandon soft speeches and to speak firmly and resolutely is “overestimating ideology”? Do they imagine that the workers can accumulate “forces” for the fight against absolutism if they know nothing about the attitude of absolutism towards the Zemstvo? All this remains unknown.
One thing alone is clear and that is that the authors of the letter have a very vague idea of what the political tasks of Social-Democracy are.
This is revealed still more clearly by their remark: “Such also [i.
e.
, also “obscures class antagon­ isms”] is Iskra’s attitude towards the student movement.
” In­ stead of calling upon the workers to declare by means of public demonstrations that the real centre of unbridled violence and outrage is not the students but the Russian government (Iskra, No.
2), wre should, no doubt, have inserted arguments in the spirit of Rabochaya My si.
And such ideas were expressed by Social-Democrats in the autumn of 1901, after the events of February and March,1 on the eve of a fresh revival of the student movement, which revealed that even in this sphere the “spon­ taneous” protest against the autocracy is “outstripping' the con­ scious Social-Democratic leadership of the movement.
The spon­ taneous striving of the workers to defend the students who were beaten up by the police and the Cossacks is outstripping the conscious activity of die Social-Democratic organisations.
“And yet in other articles,” continue the authors of the letter, “Iskra condemns all compromises, and defends, for example, the intolerant conduct of the Guesdists.
” We would advise those who usually so conceitedly and frivolously declare in connec­ tion with the disagreements existing among the contemporary Social-Democrats that the disagreements are unimportant and would not justify a split, to ponder very’ deeply over these words.
Is it possible for those wrho say that we have done 1 See explanatory note to page 17.
**—Ed, astonishingly little to explain the hostility of the autocracy to­ wards the various classes, and to inform the workers of the op­ position of the various strata of the population towards auto­ cracy, to work successfully in the same organisation with those who say that such work is “compromise”—evidently compromise with the theory of the “economic struggle against the employers and the government”? We urged the necessity of introducing the class struggle in the rural districts on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the emancipation of the peasantry (No.
3) and spoke of the ir­ reconcilability between the local government bodies and the auto­ cracy in connection with Witte’s secret memorandum.

) We attacked the feudal landlords and the government which served the latter on the occasion of the passing of the new law (No.
8), and welcomed the illegal Zemstvo congress that was held.
We urged the Zemstvo to stop making degrading petitions (No.
8), and to come out and fight.
We encouraged the students, who had begun to understand the need for the political struggle and to take up that struggle (No.
3) and, at the same time, we lashed out at the “barbarous lack of understanding” revealed by the adherents of the “purely student” movement, who called upon the students to abstain from taking part in the street demonstrations (No.
3, in connection with the manifesto issued by the executive committee of the Moscow students on February 25).
We exposed the “senseless dreams” and the “lying hypocrisy” of (he cunning liberals of Rossiya (No.

” (No.

”) We exposed the real significance of the programme of “state concern for the welfare of the workers,” and welcomed the “val­ uable admission” that “it is better by granting reforms from above to forestall the demand for such reforms from below, than to wait for those demands to be put forward.

Because by that lie drags Social-Democracy towards the “economic struggle against the employers and the government” but yields to liberalism, abandons the task of actively intervening in every “liberal” ques­ tion and of defining his own Social-Democratic attitude towards such questions.
F.
Again “Slanderers,” Again “Mystifiers” These polite expressions were uttered by Rabocheye Dyelo which in this way answers our charge that it “indirectly pre­ pared the ground for converting the labour movement into an instrument of bourgeois democracy.
” In its simplicity of heart Rabocheye Dyelo decided that this accusation was nothing more than a polemical sally, as if to say, these malicious doctrinaires can only think of saying unpleasant things about us; now what can be more unpleasant than being an instrument of bourgeois democracy? And so they print in heavy type a “refutation”: “nothing but downright slander” (Two Congresses), “mystifica­ tion,” “masquerade.
” Like Jupiter, Rabocheye Dyelo (although it has little resemblance to Jupiter) is angry because it is wrong, and proves by its hasty abuse that it is incapable of under­ standing its opponents’ mode of reasoning.
And yet, with only a little reflection it would have understood why all subservience to the spontaneity of the mass movement and any degrading of Social-Democratic politics to trade union politics mean precisely preparing the ground for converting the labour movement into an instrument of bourgeois democracy.
The spontaneous labour movement by itself is able to create (and inevitably will create) only trade unionism, and working class trade union politics are precisely working class bourgeois politics.
The fact that the working class participates in the political struggle and even in political revolution does not in itself make its politics Social-Democratic politics.
Rabocheye Dyelo imagines that bourgeois democracy in Rus­ sia is merely a “phantom.
”1 (Two Congresses.
) Happy people! Like the ostrich, they bury their heads in the sand, and imagine that everything around has disappeared.
A number of liberal publicists who month after month proclaimed to the world their triumph over the collapse and even disappearance of Marxism; a number of liberal newspapers (S.
Peter burgskiye Vyedomosti* Russkiye Vyedomosti and many others) wrhich encouraged the liberals who bring to the workers the Brentano conception of the class struggle * and the trade union conception of politics; the galaxy of critics of Marxism, whose real tendencies were so very well disclosed by the Credo and whose literary products alone circulate freely in Russia; the animation among revolu­ tionary non-Social-Democratic tendencies, particularly after the February and March events—all these, of course, are mere phantoms! All these, of course, have nothing at all to do with bourgeois democracy! Rabocheye Dyelo and the authors of the economic letter pub­ lished in Iskra, No.
12, should “ponder over the reason why the events in the spring excited such animation among the revolutionary non-SociaLDemocratic tendencies instead of increasing the authority and the prestige of Social-Democracy.
” The reason was that we failed to cope with our tasks.
The masses of the workers proved to be more active than we; we lacked adequately trained revolutionary leaders and organisers aware of the mood prevailing among all the opposition strata and able to march at the head of the movement, convert the spontaneous demonstrations into a political demonstration, 1 * * * * * * 8 1 Then follows a reference to the “concrete Russian conditions which fatalistically impel ihe labour movement onto the revolutionary path.
” But these people refuse to understand that the revolutionary path of the labour movement might not be a Social-Democratic path! When absolutism reigned in Western Europe, the entire West European bourgeoisie “im-peHed,” and deliberately impelled, the workers onto the path of rev­ olution.
We Social-Democrats, however, cannot be satisfied with that.
And if we, by any means whatever, degrade Social-Democratic politics to the level of spontaneous trade union politics, we, by that play into the hands of bourgeois democracy.

8 Lenin U broaden its political character, etc.
Under such circumstances, our backwardness will inevitably be utilised by the more mobile and more energetic non-Social-Democratic revolutionaries, and the workers, no matter how strenuously and self-sacrificing-ly they may fight the police and the troops, no matter how revolutionary they may act, will prove to be merely a force supporting these revolutionaries, the rearguard of bour­ geois democracy, and not the Social-Democratic vanguard.
Take, for example, the German Social-Democrats, whose weak sides alone our Economists desire to emulate.
Why is it that not a single political event takes place in Germany with­ out adding to the authority and prestige of Social-Democracy? Because Social-Democracy is always found to be in advance of all others in its revolutionary estimation of every event and in its champ ionship of every protest against tyranny.
It does not soothe itself by arguments about the econ­ omic struggle bringing the workers up against their own lack of rights, and about concrete conditions fatalistically impel­ ling the labour movement onto the path of revolution.
It in­ tervenes in every sphere and in every question of social and political life: in the matter of Wilhelm’s refusal to endorse a bourgeois progressive as city mayor (our Economists have not yet managed to convince the Germans that this in fact is a compromise with liberalism!); in the question of the law against the publication of “immoral” publications and pic­ tures; in the question of the government influencing the elec­ tion of professors, etc.
, etc.
Everywhere Social-Democracy is found to be ahead of all others, rousing political discon­ tent among all classes, rousing the sluggards, pushing on die laggards and providing a wealth of material for the develop­ ment of the political consciousness and political activity of the proletariat.
The result of all this is that even the avowed enemies of socialism are filled* with respect for this advanced political fighter, and sometimes an important document from bourgeois and even from bureaucratic and Court circles makes its way by some miraculous means into the editorial office of Vorwärts.
IV THE PRIMITIVENESS OF THE ECONOMISTS AND THE ORGANISATION OF REVOLUTIONARIES “Rabocheye Dyelo’s” assertions—which we have analysed— that the economic struggle is the most widely applicable means of political agitation and that our task now is to give the econo­ mic struggle itself a political character, etc.
, not only express a narrow view of our political tasks, but also of our organu national tasks.
The “economic struggle against the employers and the government” does not in the least require—and there­ fore such a struggle can never give rise to—an a!l-Russiau centralised organisation that will combine, in a general attack, all the numerous manifestations of political opposition, pro­ test and indignation, an organisation that will consist of pro­ fessional revolutionaries and be led by the real political lead­ ers of the whole of the people.
And this can be easily under­ stood.
The character of the organisation of every institution is naturally and inevitably determined by the character of the activ­ ity that institution conducts.
Consequently, Rabocheye Dyelo, by the above-analysed assertions, not only sanctifies and legit-imatises the narrowness of political activity, but also the nar­ rowness of organisational work.
And in this case also, as al­ ways, it is an organ whose consciousness yields to spontaneity.
And yet subservience to spontaneously rising forms of or­ ganisation, the lack of appreciation of the narrowness and primitiveness of our organisational work, of the degree to which we still work by “kustar1 methods” in this most important sphere, the lack of such appreciation, I say, is a very serious 1 Kustars—handicraftsmen employing primitive methods in their work— Ed.

•8 115 complaint from which our movement suffers.
It is not a com­ plaint that comes with decline, of course, it is a complaint that comes with growth.
But it is precisely at the present time, when the wave of spontaneous indignation is, as it were, wash­ ing over us, leaders and organisers of the movement, that a most irreconcilable struggle must be waged against all defence of sluggishness, against any legitimisation of restriction in tins matter, and it is particularly necessary to rouse in all those participating in the practical work, in all who are just thinking of taking it up, discontent with the primitive methods that prevail among us and an unshakable determination to get rid of them.
A.
What Are Primitive Methods? We shall try to answer this question by describing the act­ ivity of a typical Social-Democratic circle of the period of 1894-1901.
We have already referred to the manner in which the students became absorbed in Marxism at that period.
Of course, these students were not only, or even not so much, absorbed in Marxism as a theory, but as an answer to the question: “what is to be done?”; as a call to march against the enemy.
And these new warriors marched to battle with astonishingly primitive equipment and training.
In a vast num­ ber of cases, they had almost no equipment and absolutely no training.
They marched to war like peasants from the plough, snatching up a club.
A students’ circle having no contacts with the old members of the movement, no contacts with circles in other districts, or even in other parts of the same city (or with other schools), without the various sections of the revolutionary work being in any way organised, having no systematic plan of activity covering any length of time, es­ tablishes contacts with the workers and sets to work.
The circle gradually expands its propaganda and agitation; by its activ­ ities it wins the sympathies of a rather large circle of workers and of a certain section of the educated classes, which pro­ vides it with money and from which the “committee” recruits new groups of young people.
The charm which the committee (or the League of Struggle) exercises on the youth increases, its sphere of activity becomes wider and its activities ex­ pand quite spontaneously: the very people who a year or a few months previously had spoken at the gatherings of the students’ circle and discussed the question, “whither?”, who es­ tablished and maintained contacts with the workers, wrote and published leaflets, now establish contacts with other groups of revolutionaries, procure literature, set to work to establish a local newspaper, begin to talk about organising demonstrations and, finally, commence open hostilities (these open hostilities may, according to circumstances, take the form of the publica­ tion of the very first agitational leaflet, or the first newspaper, or of the organisation of the first demonstration).
And usually the first action ends in immediate and wholesale arrests.
Immediate and wholesale, precisely because these open hostilities were not the result of a systematic and carefully thought-out and gradual­ ly prepared plan for a prolonged and stubborn struggle, but simply the result of the spontaneous growth of traditional circle work; because, naturally, the police, in almost every case, knew the principal leaders of the local movement, for they had al­ ready “recommended” themselves to the police in their school­ days, and the latter only waited for a convenient moment to make their raid.
They gave the circle sufficient time to develop its work so that they might obtain a palpable corpus delicti^ and always allowed several of the persons known to them to re­ main at liberty in order to act as “decoys” (which, I believe, is the technical term used both by our people and by the gen­ darmes).
One cannot help comparing this kind of warfare with that conducted by a mob of peasants armed with clubs against modem troops.
One can only express astonishment at the virility displayed by the movement which expanded, grew and won victories in spite of the total lack of training among the fighters.
It is true that from the historical point of view, the primitiveness of equipment was not only inevitable at first, but even legitimate as one of the conditions for the wide re­ cruiting of fighters, but as soon as serious operations com-1 Offence within the meaning of the law.

menced (and they commenced in fact with the strikes in the summer of 1896), the defects in our fighting organisations made themselves felt to an increasing degree.
Thrown into con­ fusion at first and committing a number of mistakes (for ex­ ample, its appeal ito the public describing die misdeeds of die Socialists, or die deportation of the workers from die capital to the provincial industrial centres), the government very soon adapted itself to the new conditions of the struggle and man­ aged to place its perfectly equipped detachments of agents provocateurs, spies and gendarmés in the required places.
Raids became so frequent, affected such a vast number of people and cleared out the local circles so thoroughly that the masse? of die workers literally lost all their leaders, the movement assumed an incredibly sporadic character, and it became utterly impossible to establish continuity and coherence in the work.
The fact that the local active workers were hopelessly scattered, the casual manner in which the membership of the circles was recruited, the lack of training in and narrow outlook on theoretical, political and organisational questions were all the inevitable result of the conditions described above.
Things reached such a pass that in several places the workers, because of our lack of stamina and ability to maintain secrecy, began to lose faith in the intelligentsia and to avoid them: the intel­ lectuals, they said, are much too careless and lay tliemselves open to police raids! Anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the movement knows that these primitive methods at last began to be recog­ nised as a disease by all thinking Social-Democrats.
And in order that the reader who is not acquainted with the move­ ment may have no grounds for thinking that wTe are ‘Invent­ ing” a special stage or special disease of the movement, we shall refer once again to the witness we have already quoted.
No doubt we shall be excused for the length of the passage quoted: “While the gradual transition to wider practical activity,” writes B-----v in Rabocheye Dyelo, No.
6, “a transition which is closely connected with the general transitional period through which the Russian labour move­ ment if now passing, is a characteristic feature .
, .
there is, however, another and not less interesting feature in the general mechanism of the Russian workers* revolution.
We refer to the general lack of rev­ olutionary forces fit for action1 which is felt not only in St.
Petersburg, but throughout the whole of Russia.
With the general revival of the labour movement with the general development of the working masses, with the growing frequency of strikes, and with the mass labour strug­ gle becoming more and more open, which intensifies government per­ secution, arrests, deportation and exile, this lack of highly skilled revo­ lutionary forces is becoming more and more marked and, without a doubt, must affect the depth and the general character of the move­ ment.
Many strikes take plye without the revolutionary organisations exercising any strong and direct influence upon them.
.
.
.
A shortage of agitational leaflets and illegal literature is felt.
.
.
.
The workers* circles are left without agitators.
.
.
.
Simultaneously, there is a con­ stant shortage of funds.
In a word, the growth of the labour movement is outstripping the growth and development of the revolutionary organ­ isations.
The numerical strength of the active revolutionaries is too small to enable them to concentrate in their own hands all the influence exer­ cised upon the whole mass of labour now in a state of unrest, or to give this unrest even a shadow of symmetry and organisation.
.
.
.
Separate circles, individual revolutionaries, scattered, uncombined, do not represent a united, strong and disciplined organisation with the planned development of its parts.
.
.
.
** Admitting that the immediate organisation of fresh circles to take the place of those that have been broken up “merely proves the virility of the movement , .
.
but does not prove the existence of an adequate number of sufficiently fit revolu­ tionary workers,” the author concludes: “The lack of practical training among the Sl Petersburg revolution­ aries is seen in the results of their work.
The recent trials, especially that of the Self-Emancipation group and the Labour versus Capital group,* clearly showed that the young agitator, unacquainted with the details of the conditions of labour and, consequently, unacquainted with the con­ ditions under which agitation must be carried on in a given factory, ignorant of the principles of conspiracy, and understanding onjy the general principles of Social-Democracy [and it is questionable whether he understands thcml is able to carry on bis work for perhaps four, five or six months.
Then come arrests, which frequently lead to the break­ up of the whole organisation, or at all events, of part of it.
The ques­ tion arises, therefore, can the group conduct successful and fruitful activity if its existence is measured by months? Obviously, the defects of the existing organisations cannot be wholly ascribed to the transi­ tional period.
.
.
.
Obviously, the numerical and above all the qualitative strength of the organisations operating is not of little importance, and the fijrt task our Social-Democrats must undertake is effectively 10 com­ bine the organisations and make a strict selection of their membership*9 1 All italics ours-B.
Primitive Methods and Economism We must now deal with the question that has undoubtedly arisen in the mind of every reader.
Have these primitive methods, which are a complaint of growth affecting the whole of the movement, any connection with Economism, which is only one of the tendencies in Russian Social-Democracy? We think that they have.
The lack of practical training, the lack of ability to carry on organisational work is certainly common to us all.
including those who have stood unswervingly by the point of view of revolutionary Marxism from the very outset.
And, of course, no one can blame the practical workers for their lack of practical training.
But the term “primitive methods” embraces something more than mere lack of train­ ing: it means the restrictedness of revolutionary work gen­ erally, the failure to understand that a good organisation of revolutionaries cannot be built up on the basis of such re­ stricted work, and lastly—and most important—it means the attempts to justify this rcstrictedness and to elevate it to a spe­ cial “theory,” i.
e.
, subservience to spontaneity in this matter also.
As soon as such attempts were observed, it became cer­ tain that primitive methods are connected with Economism and that we shall never eliminate this restrictedness of our organi­ sational activity until we eliminate Economism generally (i.
e.
, the narrow conception of Marxian theory, of the role of Social-Democracy and of its political tasks).
And these attempts were revealed in a twofold direction.
Some began to say: the labour masses themselves have not yet brought forward the broad and militant tasks that the revolutionaries desire to “impose” upon them; they must continue for the time being to fight for im­ mediate political demands, to conduct “the economic struggle against the employers and the government”1 (and, naturally, corresponding to this struggle which is “easily understood” by the mass movement there must be an organisation that will be “easily understood” by the most untrained youth).
Others, far removed from “gradualness,” began to say: it is possible and *Rabochaya Mysl and Rabocheye Dyelo, especially the Reply to Plekh­ anov.
• necessary to “bring about a political revolution,” but this is no reason whatever for building a strong organisation of rev­ olutionaries to train the proletariat in the steadfast and stub­ born struggle.
All we need do is to snatch up our old friend, die “handy” wooden club.
Speaking without metaphor it means—we must organise a general strike,1 or we must stimulate the “spiritless” progress of the labour movement by means of “excitative terror.
”2 Both these tendencies, the opportunist and the “revolutionary,” bow to the pre­ vailing primitiveness; neither believes that it can be eliminated, neither understands our primary and mosit imperative practical task, namely, to establish an organisation of revolutionaries capable of maintaining the energy, the stability and continuity of the political struggle.
We have just quoted the words of B-----v: “The growth of the labour movement is outstripping the growth and development of the revolutionary organisations.
” This “valuable remark of a close observer” (Rabocheye Dyelo’s comment on B-----v’s ar­ ticle) has a twofold value for us.
It proves that we were right in our opinion that the principal cause of the present crisis in Russian Social-Democracy is that the leaders (“ideologists,” revolutionaries, Social-Democrats) lag behind the spontaneous rising of the masses.
It shows that all the arguments advanced bv the authors of the Economist letter in Iskra, No.

bv B.
Krichevsky and by Martynov, about the dangers of belittling the significance of the spontaneous elements, about the drab every-day struggle, about the tactics-process, etc.
, arc nothing more than a glorification and defence of primitive methods.
These people who cannot pronounce the word “theoretician” without a contemptuous grimace, who describe their genuflec­ tions to common lack of training and ignorance as “sensitive­ ness to life,” reveal in practice a failure to understand our most imnerative practical task.
To laggards they shout: Keep in step! Don’t run ahead! To people suffering from a lack of 1 See **Whn Will Bring About the Political Revolution in the sym­ posium nub!i<she<l in Russia, entitled The Proletarian Struggle.

energy and initiative in organisational work, from lack of “plans” for wide and bold organisational work, they shout about the “tactics-process”! The most serious sin we commit is that we degrade our political and organisational tasks to the level of the immediate, “palpable,” “concrete” interests of the every-day economic struggle; and yet they keep singing to us the old song: give the economic struggle itself a political char­ acter.
We say again: this kind of thing displays as much “sensitiveness to life” as was displayed by the hero in the popular fable who shouted to a passing funeral procession: many happy returns of the day! Recall the matchless, truly “Narcissus”-like superciliousness * with which these wiseacres lectured Plekhanov about the “work­ ers’ circles generally” (sic!) being “incapable of fulfilling pol­ itical tasks in the real and practical sense of the wTord, i.
e.
, in the sense of the expedient and successful practical struggle for polit­ ical demands.
” (Rabocheye Dyclo's Reply, p.
24.
) There are circles and circles, gentlemen! Circles of “kustars,” of course, are not capable of fulfilling political tasks and never will be, until they realise the primitiveness of their methods and aban­ don it.
If, besides this, these amateurs are enamoured of their primitive methods, and insist on writing the word “practical” in italics, and imagine that being practical demands that one’s tasks be degraded to the level of understanding of the most backward strata of the masses, then they are hopeless, of course, and certainly cannot fulfil general political tasks.
But circles or heroes like Alexeyev and Myshkin, Khalturin and Zhelyabov1 are able to fulfil political tasks in the genuine and most prac­ tical sense of the term because their passionate preaching meets with response among the spontaneously awakened masses, be­ cause their seething energy rouses a corresponding and sustained energy among the revolutionary class.
Plekhanov was a thousand times right not only when he pointed to this revolutionary class, not only when he proved that its spontaneous awakening was inevitable, but also when he set the “workers’ circles” a great and lofty political task.
But you refer to the mass 1 Famous revolutionaries of the ’seventies.

ed.
movement that has sprung up since that time in order to de­ grade this task, in order to curtail the energy and scope of ac­ tivity of the “workers’ circles.
” If you are not amateurs enam­ oured of your primitive methods, what are you then? You boast that you are practical, but you fail to see what every Russian practical worker knows, namely, the miracles that the energy, not only of circles, but even of individual persons is able to perform in the revolutionary cause.
Or do you think that our movements cannot produce heroes like those that were pro­ duced by the movement in the ’seventies? If so, why do you titink so? Because we lack training? But we are training our­ selves, will train ourselves, and we will be trained! Unfortu­ nately it is true that scum has formed on the surface of the stagnant waters of the “economic struggle against the employ­ ers and the government”; there are people among us who kneel in prayer to spontaneity, gazing with awe upon die “posteriors” of the Russian proletariat (as Plekhanov expresses it).
But we will rid ourselves of this scum.
The time has come when Rus­ sian revolutionaries, led by a genuinely revolutionary theory, relying upon the genuinely revolutionary and spontaneously aivakening class, can at last—at last!—rise to their full height and exert their giant strength to the utmost.
All that is required in order diat this may be so is that the masses of our practical workers, and the still larger masses of those who dream of doing practical work even while still at school, shall meet with scorn and ridicule any suggestion that may be made to de­ grade our political tasks and to restrict the scope of our or­ ganisational work.
And we shall achieve that, don’t you worry, gentlemen! .

But if the reader wishes to see the pearls of “Economist” passion for primitive methods, he must, of course, turn from the eclectic and vacillating Rabocheye Dyelo to the consistent and determined Rabochaya MysL In its Special Supplement, p.

wrote: “Now two words about the so-called revolutionary intelligentsia proper.
It is true that on more than one occasion it proved that it was quite prepared to ‘enter into determined battle with tsarism!* The unfor­ tunate thing, however, is that, ruthlessly persecuted by the political police, our revolutionary' intelligentsia imagined that the struggle with this political police was the political struggle with the autocracy.
That is why, to this day, it cannot understand ‘where the forces for the fight against the autocracy .
e to be obtained.
’ ” What matchless and magnificent contempt for the struggle with the police this worshipper (in the worst sense of the word) of the spontaneous movement displays, does he not? He is prepared to justify our inability to organise secretly by the argument that with the spontaneous growth of the mass move­ ment, it is not at all important for us to fight against the political police!! Not many would agree to subscribe to this monstrous conclusion; our defects in revolutionary organisation have become too urgent a matter to permit them to do that And if Martynov would refuse to subscribe to it, it would only be because he is unable, or lacks the courage, to think out his ideas to their logical conclusion.
Indeed, does the “task” of prompting the masses to put forward concrete demands promising palpable results call for special efforts to create a stable, cen­ tralised, militant organisation of revolutionaries? Cannot such a “task” be carried out even by masses who do not “struggle with the political police”? Moreover, can this task be ful­ filled unless, in addition to the few leaders, it is under­ taken by the workers (the overwhelming majority), who in fact are incapable of “fighting against the political police”? Such workers, average people of the masses, are capable of displaying enormous energy and self-sacrifice in strikes and in street battles with the police and troops, and are capable (in fact, are alone capable) of determining the w-hole outcome of our movement—but the struggle against the political police requires special qualities; it requires professional revolution­ aries.
And we must not only see to it that the masses “ad­ vance” concrete demands, but also that the masses of the work­ ers “advance” an increasing number of such professional rev­ olutionaries from their own ranks.
Thus we have reached the question of the relation between an organisation of professional revolutionaries and the pure and simple labour movement Al­ though this question has found little reflection in literature, it has greatly engaged us “politicians” in conversations and con­ troversies with those comrades who gravitate more or less to­ wards Economism.
It is a question that deserves special treat­ ment.
But before taking it up we shall deal with one other quotation in order to illustrate the position we hold in regard to the connection between primitiveness and Economism, In his Reply, N.
N.
wrote: “The Emancipation of Labour group demands direct struggle against the government without first considering where the material forces for this struggle are to be obtained, and without indicating ‘Me path of the strug­ gle ” Emphasising the last words, the author adds the follow­ ing footnote to the word “path”: “This cannot be explained by the conspiratorial aims pursued, because the programme does not refer to secret plotting but to a mass movement.
The masses cannot proceed by secret paths.
Can we conceive of a secret strike? Can we conceive of secret demonstrations and petitions?” (Vademecum, p.
59.
) Thus, the author approaches quite closely to the question of the “material forces” (organisers of strikes and demonstrations) and to the “paths” of the strug­ gle, but, nevertheless, is still in a state of consternation, be­ cause he “worships” the mass movement, i.
e.
, he regards it as something that relieves us of the necessity of carrying on rev­ olutionary activity and not as something that should embolden us and stimulate our revolutionary activity.
Secret strikes are impossible—for those who take a direct and immediate part in them, but a strike may remain (and in the majority of cases does remain) a “secret” to the masses of the Russian workers, because the government takes care to cut all communication between strikers, takes care to prevent all news of strikes from spreading.
Now here indeed is a special “struggle with the political police” required, a struggle that can never be con­ ducted by such large masses as usually take part in strike*.
Such a struggle must be organised, according to “all the rules of the art,” by people who are professionally engaged in rev­ olutionary activity.
The fact that the masses are spontaneously entering the movement does not make the organisation of this struggle less necessary.
On the contrary, it makes it more nec­ essary: for we Socialists would be failing in our duty' to the masses if we did not prevent the police from making a secret of (and if we did not ourselves sometimes secretly prepare) every strike and every demonstration.
A nd we shall succeed in doing this, precisely because the spontaneously awakening masses will also advance from their own ranks increasing num­ bers of ‘"professional revolutionaries'" (that is, if we are not so foolish as to advise the workers to keep on marking time).
C.
Organisation of Workers and Organisation of Revolutionaries It is only natural that a Social-Democrat, who conceives the political struggle as being identical with the ‘"economic strug­ gle against the employers and the government,” should con­ ceive of an “organisation of revolutionaries” as being more or less identical with an “organisation of workers.
” And this, in fact, is what actually happens; so that when we talk about organ­ isation, we literally talk in different longues.
I recall a conver­ sation I once had with a fairly consistent Economist, with whom I had not been previously acquainted.
We were discussing the pamphlet Who Will Make the Political Revolution? and we were very soon agreed that the principal defect in that brochure was that it ignored the question of organisation.
We were be­ ginning to think that we were in complete agreement with each other’—but as the conversation proceeded, it became clear that we were talking of different things.
My interlocutor accused the author of the brochure just mentioned of ignoring strike funds, mutual aid societies, etc.
; whereas I had in mind an organisa­ tion of revolutionaries as an essential factor in “making” the political revolution.
After that became clear, I hardly remem­ ber a single question of importance upon which I was in agree­ ment with that Economist! What was the source of our disagreement? The fact that on questions of organisation and politics the Economists are for­ ever lapsing from Social-Democracy into trade unionism.
The political struggle carried on by the Social-Democrats is far more extensive and complex than the economic struggle the workers carry on against the employers and ihe government Similarly (and indeed for that reason), the organisation of a revolutionary Social-Democratic Party must inevitably differ from the organisations of the workers designed for the latter struggle.
A workers’ organisation must in the first place be a trade organisation; secondly, it must be as wide as possible; and thirdly, it must be as public as conditions will allow (here, and further on, of course, I have only autocratic Russia in mind).
On the other hand, the organisations of revolutionaries must consist first and foremost of people whose profession is that of a revolutionary (that is why I speak of organisations of rev­ olutionaries, meaning revolutionary Social-Democrats).
In view of this common feature of the members of such an organisation, all distinctions as between workers and intellectuals, and certain­ ly distinctions of trade and profession, must be obliterated.
Such an organisation must of necessity be not too extensive and as secret as possible.
Let us examine this threefold distinction.
In countries where political liberty exists the distinction be­ tween a trade union and a political organisation is clear, as is the distinction between trade unions and Social-Democracy.
The relation of the latter to the former will naturally vary in each country according to historical, legal and other conditions—it may be more or less close or more or less complex (in our opinion it should be as close and simple as possible); but trade union organisations are certainly not in the least identical with the Social-Democratic Parly organisations in free countries.
In Russia, however, the yoke of autocracy appeals at first glance to obliterate all distinctions between a Social-Democratic organ­ isation and trade unions, because all workers’ associations and all circles arc prohibited, and because the principal manifesta­ tion and weapon of the workers’ economic struggle—the strike— is regarded as a criminal offence (and sometimes even as a pol­ itical offence!).
Conditions in our country, therefore, strongly “impel” the workers who are conducting the economic struggle to concern themselves with political questions.
They also “impel” the Social-Democrats to confuse trade unionism with Social-Democracy (and our Krichevskys, Martynovs and their like, while speaking enthusiastically of the first kind of “im­ pelling," fail to observe the “impelling" of the second kind).
Indeed, picture to yourselves the people who are immersed nine­ ty-nine per cent in “the economic struggle against the employers and die government.
" Some of them have never, during the whole course of their activity (four to six months), thought of the need for a more complex organisation of revolutionaries; others, perhaps, come across the fairly widely distributed Bern-steinian literature, from which they become convinced of the profound importance of the forward march of “the drab every­ day struggle.
” Still others are carried away, perhaps, by the seductive idea of showing the world a new example of “close and organic contact with the proletarian struggle"—contact be­ tween the trade union and Social-Democratic movements.
Such people would perhaps argue that the later a country enters into the arena of capitalism and, consequently, of the labour move­ ment, the more the Socialists in that country may take pail in, and support, the trade union movement, and the less reason is there for non-Social-Democratic trade unions.
So far, the argu­ ment is absolutely correct; unfortunately, however, some go beyond that and hint at the complete fusion of Social-Dem­ ocracy with trade unionism.
We shall soon see.
from the example of the rules of the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle, what a harmful effect these dreams have upon our plans of organ­ isation.
The workers’ organisations for carrying on the economic struggle should be trade union organisations; every Social-Democratic worker should, as far as possible, support and actively work inside these organisations.
That is true.
But it is not in the least in our interest to demand that only Social-Democrats be eligible for membership in the trade unions, for this would only restrict our influence over the masses.
Let every worker who understands the need for organisation in order to carry on the struggle against the employers and the govern­ ment join the trade unions.
The very objects of the trade unions would be unattainable unless they were exttemely wide organ­ isations.
The wider these organisations are, the wider our in­ fluence over them will be.
and this influence will be exercised not only through the “spontaneous” development of the economic struggle, but also by the direct and conscious effect the Socialist members of the union have on their comrades.
But a wide organisation cannot apply the methods of strict secrecy (since the latter demands far greater training than is required for the economic struggle).
How is the contradiction between the need for a large membership and the need for strictly secret methods to be reconciled? How are we to make the trade unions as public as possible? Generally speaking, there are perhaps only two ways to this end: either the trade unions become legal­ ised (which in some countries precedes the legalisation of the socialist and political unions), or the organisation is kept a secret one.
but so “free” and amorphous, lose as the Germans say, that the need for secret methods becomes almost negligible * as far as the bulk of the members is concerned.
The legalisation of the non-socialist and non-political labour unions in Russia has already begun, and there is no doubt that every advance our rapidly growing Social-Democratic working class movement makes will increase and encourage the attempts at legalisation.
These attempts proceed for the most part from supporters of the existing order, but they will proceed also from the workers themselves and from the liberal intellectuals.
The banner of legality has already been unfurled by the Vassilyevs and the Zubatovs.
Support has been promised by the Ozerovs and the Wormses, and followers of the new tendency are to be found among the workers.
Henceforth, we must reckon with this tendency.
How are we to reckon with it? There can be no two opinions about this among Social-Democrats.
We must constantly expose any part played in this movement by the Zubatovs and the Vassilyevs, the gendarmes and the priests, and explain to the workers what their real intentions are.
We must also expose the conciliatory, “harmonious” undertones that will be heard in the speeches delivered by liberal politicians at the legal meetings of the workers, irrespective of whether they proceed from an earnest conviction of the desirability of peaceful class col­ laboration, whether they proceed from a desire to curry favour with the employers, or are simply the result of 9 I-enin n clumsiness.
We must also warn the workers against the traps often set by the police, who at such open meetings and permit­ ted societies spy out the “hotheads” and who, through the medium of the legal organisations, endeavour to plant their agents pro­ vocateurs in the illegal organisations.
But while doing all this, we must not forget that in the long run the legalisation of the working class movement will be to our advantage, and not to that of tlie Zubatovs.
On the contrary, our campaign of exposure will help to separate the tares from the wheat.
What the tares are, we have already indicated.
By the wheat, we mean attracting the attention of still larger and more backward sections of the workers to social and political questions, and freeing ourselves, the revolutionaries, from func­ tions which are essentially legal (the distribution of legal books, mutual aid, etc.
), the development of which will inevitably provide us with an increasing quantity of material for agitation.
In this sense, wc may say, and we should say, to the Zubatovs and the Ozerovs: keep at it, gentlemen, do your best! When you place a trap in the path of the workers (either by way of direct provocation, or by the “honest” corruption of the workers with the aid of “Struve-ism”), we shall see to it that you are exposed.
But whenever you take a real step forward, even if it is timid and vacillating, we shall say: please continue! And the only step that can be a real step forward is a real, if small, extension of the workers’ field of action.
Every such extension will be to our advantage and will help to hasten the advent of legal societies, not of the kind in which agents provocateurs hunt for Socialists, but of the kind in which Socialists will hunt for adherents.
In a word, our task is to fight down the tares.
It is not our business to grow wheat in flower-pots.
By pulling up the tares, we clear the soil for the wheat.
And while the old-fashioned folk are tending their flower-pot crops, we must pre­ pare reapers, not only to cut down the tares of today, but also to reap the wheat of tomorrow.
Legalisation, therefore, will not solve the problem of creating a trade union organisation that will be as public and as exten­ sive as possible (but we would be extremely glad if the Zuba-tovs and the Ozerovs provided even a partial opportunity for such a solution—to which end we must fight them as strenu­ ously as possible!).
There only remains the path of secret trade union organisation; and ive must offer all possible as­ sistance to the workers, who (as we definitely know) have al­ ready adopted this path.
Trade union organisations may not only be of tremendous value in developing and consolidating the econ­ omic struggle, but may also become a very important auxiliary to political agitation and revolutionary organisation.
In order to achieve this purpose, and in order to guide the nascent trade union movement in the direction the Social-Democrats desire, we must first fully understand the foolishness of the plan of organisation with which the St Petersburg Economists have been occupying themselves for nearly five years.
Thal plan is described in the “Rules for a Workers* Benefit Fund” of July 1897 (Listok Rabotnika, No.
9-10, p.
46, in Rabochaya Mysl, No.
1), and also in the “Rules for a Trade Union Workers’ Organisation,” of October 1900.
(Special leaflet printed in St.
Petersburg and quoted in Iskra, No.
1.
) The fundamental error contained in both these sets of rules is that they give a detailed formulation of a wide workers’ organisation and confuse the latter with the organisation of revolutionaries.
Let us take the last-mentioned set of rules, since it is drawn up in greater de­ tail.
The body of it consists of fifty-two paragraphs.
Twenty-three paragraphs deal with structure, the method of conducting business and the competence of the “workers’ circles,” which are to be organised in every factory (“not more than ten per­ sons”) and which elect “central (factory) groups.
” “The central group,” says paragraph 2, “observes all that goes on in its factory or workshop and keeps a record of events.
” “The central group presents to the contributors a monthly report on the state of the funds” (par.
17), etc.
Ten paragraphs are devoted to tlie “district organisation,” and nineteen to the highly complex in­ terconnection between the Committee of the Workers’ Organisa­ tion and the Committee of the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle (delegates from each district and from the “executive groups”— “groups of propagandists, groups (or maintaining contact with the provinces and with the organisation abroad, and for man­ aging stores, publications and funds”).
Social-Democracy = “executive groups” in relation to the econ­ omic struggle of the workers! It would be difficult to find a more striking illustration than this of how the Economists’ ideas deviate from Social-Democracy to trade unionism, and how for­ eign to them is the idea that a Social-Democrat must concern himself first and foremost with an organisation of revolution­ aries, capable of guiding the whole proletarian struggle for emancipation.
To talk of “the political emancipation of the working class” and the struggle against “tsarist despotism,” and at the same time to draft rules like these, indicates a com­ plete failure to understand what the real political tasks of So­ cial Democracy are.
Not one of the fifty or so paragraphs reveals the slightest glimmer of understanding that it is necessary to conduct the widest possible political agitation among the masses, an agitation that deals with every phase of Russian absolutism and with every aspect of the various social classes in Russia.
Rules like these are of no use even for the achievement of trade union aims, let alone political aims, for that requires organisa­ tion according to trade, and yet the rules do not contain a single reference to this.
But most characteristic of all, perhaps, is the amazing top­ heaviness of the whole “system,” which attempts to bind every factory with the “committee” by a permanent string of uniform and ludicrously petty rules and a three-stage system of election.
Hemmed in by the narrow outlook of Economism, the mind is lost in details which positively reek of red tape and bureaucracy.
In practice, of course, three-fourths of the clauses are never applied; on the other hand, however, a “conspiratorial” organ­ isation of this kind, with its central group in each factory, makes it very easy for the gendarmes to carry out raids on a large scale.
Our Polish comrades have already passed through a similar phase in their own movement, when everybody was extremely enthusiastic about the extensive organisation of work­ ers’ funds; but these ideas were very quickly abandoned when it was found that such organisations only provided rich harvests for the gendarmes.
If we are out for wide workers’ organisa­ tions, and not for wide arrests, if it is not our purpose to pro­ vide satisfaction to the gendarmes, these organisations must re­ main absolutely loose.
But will they be able to function? Well, let us see what the functions are: .
to observe all that goes on in the factory and keep a record of events.
” (Par.
2 of the Rules.
) Do we need a special group for this? Could not the purpose be better served by correspondence conducted in the illegal papers and without setting up special groups? .
to lead the struggles of the workers for the improvement of their workshop conditions.
” (Par.
3 of the Rules.
) This, too, requires no special group.
Any agitator with any intelligence at all can gather what demands the workers want to advance in the course of ordinary conversation and transmit them to a narrow—not a wide—organisation of revolutionaries to be embodied in a leaflet.
.
.
to organise a fund .
.
.
to which contributions of two ko­ peks per ruble1 should be made” (par.
9) .
.
.
to present month­ ly reports to the contributors on the state of the funds (par.
17) .
.
.
to expel members who fail to pay their contributions (par.
10), and so forth.
Why, this is a very paradise for the police; for nothing would be easier than for them to penetrate into the ponderous secrecy of a “central factory fund,” confiscate the money and arrest the best members.
Would it not be simpler to issue one-kupek or two-kopek coupons bearing the official stamp of a well-known (very exclusive and very secret) organ­ isation.
or to make collections without coupons of any kind and to print reports in a certain agreed code in the illegal paper? The object would thereby be attained, but it would be a hundred times more difficult for the gendarmes to pick up clues.
I could go on analysing the rules, but I think that what has been said will suffice.
A small, compact core, consisting of reli­ able, experienced and hardened workers, with responsible agents in the principal districts and connected by all the rules of strict secrecy with the organisations of revolutionaries, can, with the wide support of the masses and without an elaborate organ­ isation, perform all the functions of a trade union organisation» 1 Of wages earned.

and perforin them, moreover, in the manner Social-Democrats desire.
Only in this way can we secure the consolidation and development of a Social-Democratic trade union movement, in spite of the gendarmes.
It may be objected that an organisation which is so loose that it is not even definitely formed, and which even has no enrolled and registered members, cannot be called an organisation at all.
That may very well be.
I am not cut for names.
But tins “or­ ganisation without members” can do everything that is required, and will, from the very outset, guarantee the closest contact be­ tween our future trade unions and socialism.
Only an incorrig­ ible utopian would want a wide organisation of workers, with elections, reports, universal suffrage, etc.
, under the autocracy.
The moral to be drawn from this is a simple one.
If we begin with the solid foundation of a strong organisation of revolutionaries, we can guarantee the stability of the movement as a whole and carry out the aims of both Social-Democracy and of trade unionism.
If, however, wre begin with a wide work­ ers’ organisation, supposed to he most “accessible” to the masses, when as a mailer of fact it will be most accessible, to the gendarmes and will make the revolutionaries most accessible to the police, we shall achieve the aims neither of Social-Dem­ ocracy nor of trade unionism; we shall not escape from our primitiveness, and because we constantly remain scattered and broken up, we shall make only the trade unions of the Zubatov and Ozerov type most accessible to the masses.
What, properly speaking, should be the functions of the or­ ganisation of revolutionaries? We shall deal wTith this in detail.
But first let us examine a very typical argument advanced by the terrorist, who (sad fate!) in this matter also is a next-door neighbour to the Economist.
Svoboda (No.
1), a journal pub­ lished for workers, contains an article entitled “Organisa­ tion,” the author of which tries to defend his friends, the Econ­ omist workers of Ivanovo-Voznesensk.
He writes: •‘It is bad thing when the crowd is mute and unenlightened, and when the movement does not proceed from the rank and file.
For in­ stance, the students of a university town have for their homes during the summer and other vacations and immediately the workers’ movement comes to a standstill.
.
.
.
Can a workers* movement which has to be pushed on from outside be a real force? Of course not! It has not yet learned to walk, it is still in leading strings.
So it is everywhere.
The students go off, and everything comes to a standstill.
As soon as the cream is skimmed—the milk turns sour.
If the ‘committee’ is arrested, everything comes to a standstill until a new one can be formed.
And one never knows what sort of committee will be set up next—it may be nothing like the former one.
The first preached one thing, the second may preach the very opposite.
The continuity between yesterday and tomorrow is broken, the experience of the past does not enlighten the future.
And all this is because no deep roots have been struck in the crowd; because, instead of having a hundred fools at work, we have a dozen wise men.
A dozen wise men can be caught up at a snap; but when the organisation embraces the crowd, everything will proceed from the crowd, and nobody, however zealous, can stop the cause.
” (P.
63.
) The facts are described correctly.
The above quotation pre­ sents a fairly good picture of our primitive methods.
But the conclusions drawn from it are worthy of Rabochaya My si both for their stupidity and their political tactlessness.
They represent the height of stupidity, because the author confuses the philosophical and social-historical question of the “depth” of the “roots” of the movement with the technical and organisa­ tional question of the best method of fighting the gendarmes.
They represent the height of political tactlessness, because the author, instead of appealing from tlie bad leaders to the good leaders, appeals from the leaders in general to the “crowd.
” This is as much an attempt to drag the movement back organisa­ tionally as the idea of substituting excitative terrorism for polit­ ical agitation is an attempt to drag it back politically.
Indeed, I am experiencing a veritable enibarras de richesses, and hardly know where to begin to disentangle the confusion Svoboda has introduced in this subject.
For the sake of clarity, I shall begin by quoting an example.
Take the Germans.
It will not be denied, I hope, that the German organisations embrace the crowd, that in Germany everything proceeds from the crowd, that the work­ ing class movement there has learned to walk.
Yet observe how this vast crowd of millions values its “dozen” tried political leaders, how firmly it clings to them! Members of the hostile parties in parliament often tease the Socialists by exclaiming: “Fine democrats you are indeed! Your movement is a working class movement only in name; as a matter of fact, it is the same clique of leaders that is always in evidence, Bebel and Lieb­ knecht, year in and year out, and that goes on for decades» Your deputies who are supposed to be elected from among the workers are more permanent than the officials appointed by the Emperor!*’ But the Germans only smile with contempt at these demagogic attempts to set the “crowd” against the “leaders,” to arouse bad and ambitious instincts in the former, and to rob the movement of its solidity and stability by undermining the con­ fidence of the masses in their “dozen wise men.
” The political ideas of the Germans have already developed sufficiently and they have acquired enough political experience to enable them to understand that without the “dozen” tried and talented lead­ ers (and -talented men are not born by the hundred), profession­ ally trained, schooled by long experience and working in perfect harmony, no class in modem society is capable of conducting a determined struggle.
The Germans have had demagogues in their ranks who have flattered the “hundred fools,” exalted them above the “dozen wise men,” extolled the “mighty fists” of the masses, and (like Most and Hasselmann) have spurred them on to reckless “revolutionary” action and sown distrust towards the firm and steadfast leaders.
It was only by stubborn­ ly and bitterly combating every element of demagogy within the socialist movement that German socialism managed to grow and become as strong as it is.
Our wiseacres, however, at the very moment when Russian Social-Democracy is passing through a crisis entirely due to our lack of sufficient numbers of trained, developed and experienced leaders to guide the spontaneous ferment of the masses, cry out with the profundity of fools, “it is a had thing when the movement does not proceed from tho rank and file.
” “A committee of students is no good, it is not stable.
” Quito true.
But the conclusion that should be drawn from this is that we must have a committee of professional revolutionaries and it docs not matter whether a student or a worker is capable of qualifying himself as a professional revolutionary.
The con­ clusion you draw, however, is that the working class movement must not be pushed on from outside! In your political inno» cencc you fail to observe that you are playing into the hands of our Economists and fostering our primitiveness.
I would like to ask, what is meant by the students “pushing on’* the workers? All it means is that the student brought to the worker the fragments of political knowledge he possesses, the crumbs of socialist ideas he has managed to acquire (for the principal in­ tellectual diet of the present-day student, “legal Marxism,” can furnish only the ABC, only the crumbs of knowledge).
There has never been too much of such “pushing on from outside,” on the contrary, so far there has been too little, all too little of it in our movement; we have been stewing in our own juice far too long; we have bowed far too slavishly before the spontane­ ous “economic struggle of the workers against the employers and the government.
” Wc professional revolutionaries must con­ tinue, and will continue, this kind of “pushing,” and a hundred times more forcibly than we have done hitherto.
The very fact that you select so despicable a phrase as “pushing on from out­ side”—a phrase which cannot but rouse in the workers (at least in the workers who are as ignorant as you yourselves arc) a sense of distrust towards all who bring them political know­ ledge and revolutionary experience from outside, and rouse in them an instinctive hostility to such people—proves that you are demagogues, and a demagogue is the worst enemy of the working class.
Oh! Don’t start howling about my “uncomradely methods” of controversy.
I have not the least intention of casting aspersions upon the purity of your intentions.
As I have already said, ona may become a demagogue out of sheer political innocence.
But I have shown that you have descended to demagogy, and I shall never tire of repeating that demagogues are the worst enemies of the working class, because they arouse bad instincts in the crowd, because the ignorant worker is unable to recognise his enemies in men who represent themselves, and sometimes sin­ cerely represent themselves, to be his friends.
They are the worst enemies of the working class, because in this period of disper­ sion and vacillation, when our movement is just beginning to take shape, nothing is easier than to employ demagogic methods to side-track the crowd, which can realise its mistake only by bitter experience.
That is why the slogan of the day for Russian Social-Democrats must be: determined opposition to Svoboda and Rabocheye Dyelo, both of which have sunk to die level of demagogy.
We shall return to this subject again? “A dozen wise men can be more easily caught than a hundred fools!” This wonderful truth (which the hundred fools will applaud) appears obvious only because in the very midst of the argument you have skipped from one question to another.
You began by talking, and continued to talk, of catching a “com­ mittee,” of catching an “organisation,” and now you skip to the question of getting hold of the “roots” of the movement in the “depths.
” The fact is, of course, that our movement cannot be caught precisely because it has hundreds and hundreds of thousands of roots deep down among the masses; but that is not the point we are discussing.
As far as “deep roots” are con­ cerned, we cannot be “caught” even now, in spite of all our primitiveness; but we all complain, and cannot but complain, that the organisations are caught, with the result that it is impossible .
to maintain continuity in the movement.
If you agree to discuss the question of catching the organisations and to stick to that question, then I assert that it is far more difficult to catch a dozen wise men than it is to catch a hundred fools.
And this position I shall defend no matter how much you instigate the crowd against me for my “anti-democratic” views, etc.
As I have already said, by “wise men,” in connection with organisa­ tion, I mean professional revolutionaries, irrespective of whether they are trained from among students or workingmen.
I assert: 1) that no movement can be durable without a stable organisa­ tion of leaders to maintain continuity; 2) that the more widely the masses are spontaneously drawn into the struggle and form the basis of the movement and participate in i*t, the more neces­ sary is it to have such an organisation, and the more stable must 1 For the moment we shall observe merely that our remarks on “push­ ing on from outside” and the other views on orcanisation expressed by Svoboda apply entirely, to all the Economists, including the adherents of Rabocheye Dyelo, for either they themselves have preached and defended such views on organisation, or have themselves drifted into them.
it be (for it is much easier for demagogues to side-track the more backward sections of the masses); 3) that the organisation must consist chiefly of persons engaged in revolutionary activ­ ities as a profession; 4) that in a country with an autocratic government, the more we restrict the membership of this organ­ isation to persons who are engaged in revolutionary activities as a profession and who have been professionally trained in the art of combating the political police, the more difficult will it be to catch the organisation, and 5) the wider will be the circle of men and women of the working class or of other classes of society able to join the movement and perform active work in it.
I invite our Economists, terrorists and “Economists-terrorists” 1 to confute these propositions.
At the moment, I shall deal only with the last two points.
The question as to whether it is easier to catch “a dozen wise men” or “a hundred fools” reduces itself to the question wc have considered above, namely, whether it is possible to have a mass organisation when the maintenance of strict secrecy is essential.
We can never give a mass organisation that degree of secrecy which is essential for the persistent and continuous struggle against the government.
But to concentrate all secret functions in the hands of as small a number of pro­ fessional revolutionaries as possible does not mean that the latter will “do the thinking for all” and that the crowd will not take an active part in the movement.
On the contrary, the crowd will advance from its ranks increasing numbers of professional revolutionaries, for it will know that it is not enough for a few students and workingmen, waging economic war, to gather 1 This latter term is perhaps more applicable to Svoboda than the former, for in an article entitled “The Regeneration of Revolutionism** it defends terrorism, while in the article at present under review it de­ fends Economism.
One might say of Svoboda that “it would if it could, but it can’t.
” Its.
wishes and intentions are excellent—but the result is utter confusion: and this is chiefly due to the fact that while Svoboda advocates continuity of organisation, it refuses to recognise the continuity of revolutionary thought and of Social-Democratic theory.
It wants to revive the professional revolutionary (“The Regeneration of Revolution-ism”), and t* that end proposes, first, excitative terrorism, and secondly, “the organisation of the average worker,” because he will be less likely to be “pushed on from outside.
” In other words, it proposes to pull the house down to use the timber for warming it.
together and form a “committee,” but that it takes years to train professional revolutionaries; the crowd will “think” not of primitive ways but of training professional revolutionaries.
The centralisation of the secret functions of the organisation does not mean the centralisation of all the functions of the movement.
The active participation of the broad masses in the dissemination of illegal literature will not diminish because a dozen professional revolutionaries centralise the secret part of tire work; on the contrary, it will increase tenfold.
Only in this way will the reading of illegal literature, the contribution to illegal literature and to some extent even the distribution of illegal literature almost cease to be secret work, for the police will soon come to realise the folly and futility of setting the whole judicial and administrative machine into motion to in­ tercept every copy of a publication that is being broadcast in thousands.
This applies not only to the press, but to every func­ tion of the movement, even to demonstrations.
The active and widespread participation of the masses will not suffer; on the contrary, it will benefit by the fact that a “dozen” experienced revolutionaries, no less professionally trained than the police, will centralise all the secret side of the work—prepare leaflets, work out approximate plans and appoint bodies of leaders for each urban district, for each factory district and for each educa­ tional institution, etc.
(I know that exception will be taken to my “undemocratic” views, but I shall reply to this altogether unintelligent objection later on.
) The centralisation of the more secret functions in an organisation of revolutionaries will not diminish, but rather increase the extent and the quality of the activity of a large number of other organisations intended for wide membership and which, therefore, can be as loose and as public as possible, for example, trade unions, workers’ circles for self-education and the reading of illegal literature, and so­ cialist and also democratic circles for all other sections of the population, etc.
, etc.
We must have as large a number as pos­ sible of such organisations having the widest possible variety of functions, but it is absurd and dangerous to confuse these with organisations of revolutionaries, to erase the line of demarcation between them, to dim still more the masses’ already incredibly hazy appreciation of the fact that in order to “serve” the mast* movement we must have people who will devote themselves ex­ clusively to Social-Democratic activities, and that such people must train themselves patiently and steadfastly to he profession­ al revolutionaries.
Aye, this appreciation has become incredibly dim.
The most grievous sin we have committed in regard to organisation is that by our primiliveness we have lowered the prestige of rev­ olutionaries in Russia, A man who is weak and vacillating on theoretical questions, who has a narrow outlook, who makes ex­ cuses for his own slackness on the ground that the masses are awakening spontaneously, who resembles a trade union secretary more than a people’s tribune, who is unable to conceive of a broad and bold plan, who is incapable of inspiring even his opponents with respect for himself, and who is inexperienced and clumsy in his own professional art—the art of combating the political po­ lice—such a man is not a revolutionary but a wretched amateur! Let no active worker take offence at these frank remarks, for as far as insufficient training is concerned, I apply them first and foremost to myself.
I used to work in a circle that set itself great and all-embracing tasks; and every member of that circle suffered to the point of torture from the realisation that we were proving ourselves to be amateurs at a moment in history when we might have been able to say, paraphrasing a well-known epigram: “Give us an organisation of revolutionaries, and we shall overturn the whole of Russia!” And the more I recall the burning sense of shame I then experienced, the more bitter are my feelings towards those pseudo-Social-Democrats whose teachings bring disgrace on the calling of a revolutionary, who fail to understand that our task is not to degrade the revolu­ tionaries to the level of an amateur, but to exalt the amateur to the level of a revolutionary.
D.
The Scope of Organisational Work We have already heard from B-----v about “the lack of revolu­ tionary forces fit for action which is felt not only in St.
Peters­ burg, but throughout the whole of Russia.
” No one, we suppose, will dispute this fact.
But the question is, how is it to be ex« plained? B-----v writes: “We shall not enter in detail into the historical causes of this phen­ omenon; we shall state merely that a society, demoralised by prolonged political reaction and split by past and present economic changes, advan­ ces from its own ranks an extremely small number of persons fit for revolutionary work; that the working class does advance from its own ranks revolutionary workers who to some extent reinforce the ranks of the illegal organisations, but that the number of such revolutionaries is inad­ equate to meet the requirements of the times.
This is more particularly the case because the worker engaged for eleven and a half hours a day in the factory is mainly able to fulfil the functions of an agitator; but propaganda and organisation, delivery and reproduction of illegal literature, issuing leaflets, etc.
, are duties which must necessarily fall mainly upon the shoulders of an extremely small intelligent force.
” (Rabocheye Dyelo, No.
6, pp.
38-39.
) There are many points in the above upon which we disagree with B------v, particularly with those points we have emphas« ised, and which most strikingly reveal that, although weary of our primitive methods (as every practical worker who thinks over the position would he), B-----v cannot find the way out of this” intolerable situation, because he is so ground down by Econ-omism.
It is not true to say that society advances few persons from its ranks fit for “work.
” It advances very many, but we are unable to make use of them all.
The critical, transitional state of our movement in this connection may be formulated as follows: there arc no people—yet there are enormous numbers of people.
There are enormous numbers of people, because the working class and the most diverse strata of society, year after year, advance from their ranks an increasing number of dis­ contented people who desire to protest, who are ready to render all the assistance they can in the fight against absolutism, the intolerableness of which is not yet recognised by all, but is nevertheless more and more acutely sensed by increasing masses of the people.
At the same time we have no people, because we have no leaders, no political leaders, we have no talented org­ anisers capable of organising extensive and at the same time uniform and harmonious work that would give employment to all forces, even the most inconsiderable.
“The growth and de­ velopment of revolutionary organisations” not only lag behind the growth of the labour movement, which even B-----v admits, but also behind the general democratic movement among all strata of the people (in passing, probably B------v would now admit this supplement to his conclusion).
The scope of revolu­ tionary work is too narrow compared with the breadth of the spontaneous basis of the movement.
It is too hemmed in by the wretched “economic struggle against the employers and the gov­ ernment” theory.
And yet, at the present time, not only Social-Democratic political agitators, but also Social-Democratic organ­ isers must “go among all classes of the population.
” 1 There is hardly a single practical worker who would have any doubt about the ability of Social-Democrats to distribute the thousand and one minute functions of their organisational work among the various representatives of the most varied classes.
Lack of specialisation is one of our most serious tech­ nical defects, about which B-----v justly and bitterly complains.
The smaller each separate “operation” in our common cause will be, the more people we shall find capable of carrying out such operations (people, who, in the majority of cases, are not capable of becoming professional revolutionaries), the more difficult will it be for the police to “catch” all these “detail workers,” and the more difficult will it lie for them .
to frame up, out of an arrest for some petty affair, a “case” that would justify the government’s expenditure on the “secret service.
” As for the number ready to help us, we have already referred in the pre­ vious chapter to the gigantic change that has taken place in this respect in the last five years or so.
On the other hand, in order to unite all these tiny fractions into one whole, in order, in breaking up functions, to avoid breaking up the movement, and in order to imbue those who carry out these minute functions with the conviction that their work is necessary and important, for without this they will never do the work,2 it is necessary 1 For example, in military circles an undoubted revival of the demo­ cratic spirit has recently been observed, partly as a consequence of the frequent street fights that now take place against “enemies” like work­ ers and students.
And as soon as our available forces permit, we must without fail devote serious attention to .
propaganda and agitation among soldiers and officers, and to the creation of “military organisations” af­ filiated to our Party.
’1 recall the story a comrade related to me of a factory inspector, who, desiring to help, and while in fact helping Social-Democracy, bitterly to have a strong organisation of tried revolutionaries.
The more secret such an organisation would be, the stronger and more widespread would be the confidence of the masses in the Party, and, as we know, m time of war, it is not only of great im­ portance to imbue one’s own army with confidence in its own strength, it is important also to convince the enemy and all neutral elements of this strength; friendly neutrality may some­ times decide the issue.
If such an organisation existed on a firm theoretical basis, and possessed a Social-Democratic journal, we would have no reason to fear that the movement would be di­ verted from its path by the numerous ‘‘outside” elements that are attracted to it.
(On the contrary, it is precisely at the present time, when primitive methods prevail among us, that many So­ cial-Democrats are observed to gravitate towards the Credo, and only imagine that they are Social-Democrats.
) In a word, spe­ cialisation necessarily presupposes centralisation, and in its turn imperatively calls for it.
But B-----v himself, who has so excellently described the ne­ cessity for specialisation, underestimates its importance, in our opinion, in the second part of the argument that we have quoted.
The number of working class revolutionaries is inade­ quate, he says.
This is absolutely true, and once again we as­ sert that the “valuable communication of a close observer” complained that he did not know whether the “information” he sent reached the proper revolutionary quarter; he did not know how much his help was really required, and what possibilities there were for utilis­ ing his small services.
Every practical worker, of course, knows of more than one case, similar to this, of our primitiveness depriving us of allies.
And these services, each “small” in itself, but incalculable when taken to­ gether, could be rendered to us by office employees and officials, not only in factories, but in the postal service, on the railways, in the Customs, among the nobility, among the clergy and every other walk of life, in­ cluding even the police service and the Court! Had we a real party, a real militant organisation of revolutionaries, w’e would not put the ques­ tion bluntly to every one of these “abettors,” we would not hasten in every single case to bring them right into the very heart of our “illegal­ ity,” but, on the contrary, we would husband them very carefully and would train people especially for such functions, bearing in mind the fact that many students could be of much greater service to the Party as “abettors”—officials—than as “short-term” revolutionaries.
But, I repeat, only an organisation that is already established and has no lack of active forces would have the right to apply such tactics.
fully confirms our view of the causes of the present crisis in Social-Democracy, and, consequently, confirms our view of the means for removing these causes.
Not only are revolutionaries lagging behind the spontaneous awakening of the masses gen­ erally, but even working class revolutionaries are lagging behind the spontaneous awakening of the working class masses.
And this fact most strikingly confirms, even from tlie “practical” point of view, not only the absurdity but even the political re-actionariness of the “pedagogics” to which we are so often treated when discussing our duties to the workers.
This fact proves that our very first and most imperative duty is to help to train working class revolutionaries who will be on the same level in regard to Parly activity as intellectual revolutionaries (we emphasise the words “in regard to Party activity,” because al­ though it is necessary, it is not so easy and not so imperative to bring the workers up to the level of intellectuals in other re­ spects).
Therefore, attention must be devoted principally to the task of raising the workers to the level of revolutionaries, and not to degrading ourselves to the level of the “labour masses” as the Economists wish to do, or necessarily to the level of the average worker, as Svoboda desires to do (and by this raises itself to the second grade of Economist “pedagogics”).
I am far from denying the necessity for popular literature for the workers, and especially popular (but, of course, not vulgar) literature for the especially backward workers.
But what annoys me is that pedagogics are constantly confused with questions of politics and organisation.
You, gentlemen, who are so much concerned about the “average worker,” as a matter of fact, rather insult the workers by your desire to talk down to them when discussing labour politics and labour organisation.
Talk about serious things in a serious manner; leave pedagogics to the pedagogues, and not to politicians and to organisers! Are there not advanced people, “average people,” and “masses,” among the intelligentsia? Does not everyone recognise that po­ pular literature is required also for the intelligentsia and is not such literature written? Just imagine someone, in an article on organising college or high-school students, repeating over 10 Lenin It and over again, as if he had made a new discovery, that first of all we must have an organisation of “average students.
” The author of such an article would rightly be laughed at.
He would be told: give us an organisational idea, if you have one, and we ourselves will settle the question as to which of us are “average,” as to who is higher and who is lower.
But if you have no organ­ isational ideas of your own, then all your chatter about “masses” and “average” is simply boring.
Try to understand that these questions about “politics” and “organisation” are so serious in themselves that they cannot be dealt with in any other but a serious way.
We can and must educate workers (and university and high-school students) so as to enable them to understand us when we speak to them about these questions; and when you do come to us to talk about these questions, give us real replies to -them, do not fall back on the “average,” or on the “masses”; don’t evade them by quoting adages or mere phrases.
1 In order to be fully prepared for his task, the working class revolutionary must also become a professional revolutionary.
Hence B-----v is wrong when he says that as the worker is engaged for eleven and a half hours a day in the factory, therefore, the brunt of all the other revolutionary functions (apart from agita­ tion) “must necessarily fall mainly upon the shoulders of an extremely small intellectual force.
” It need not “necessarily” be so.
It is so because we are backward, because we do not re­ cognise our duty to assist every capable worker to become a professional agitator, organiser, propagandist, literature distrib­ utor, etc.
, etc.
In this respect, we waste our strength in a posi­ tively shameful manner; we lack the ability to husband that which should be tended and reared with special care.
Look at the Germans: they have a hundred times more forces than 1 Svoboda, No.
1, p.
66, in the article “Organisation”: “The heavy tread of the army of labour will reinforce all the demands that will be advanced by Russian Labour”—Labour with a capital L, of course.
And this very author exclaims: “I am not in the least hostile towards the intelligentsia, but” (this is the very word, but, that Shchedrin translated as meaning: the ears never grow higher than the forehead!) “but it always fright­ fully annoys me when a man comes to me, utters beautiful and charming words and demands that they be accepted for their (his?) beauty and other virtues.
” (P.
62.
) Yes.
This ‘’always frightfully annoy»” me too.
we have.
But they understand perfectly well that the “aver­ age” does not too frequently promote really capable agitators, etc.
, from its ranks.
Hence they immediately try to place every capable workingman in such conditions as will enable him to develop and apply his abilities to the utmost: he is made a professional agitator, he is encouraged to widen the field of his activity, to spread it from one factory to the whole of his trade, from one locality to the whole country.
He acquires ex­ perience and dexterity in his profession, his outlook becomes wider, his knowledge increases, he observes the prominent polit­ ical leaders from other localities and other parties, he strives to rise to their level and combine within himself the knowledge of working class environment and freshness of socialist con­ victions with professional skill, without which the proletariat cannot carry on a stubborn struggle with the excellently trained enemy.
Only in this way can men of the stamp of Bebel and Auer be promoted from the ranks of the working class.
But what takes place very largely automatically in a politically free country must in Russia be done deliberately and systematically by our organisations.
A workingman agitator who is at all talented and “promising” must not be left to work eleven hours a day in a factory.
We must arrange that he be main­ tained by the Party, that he may in due time go underground, that he change the place of his activity, otherwise he will not enlarge his experience, he will not widen his outlook, and will not be able to stay in the fight against the gendarmes for at least a few years.
As the spontaneous rise of the working class masses becomes wider and deeper, they not only promote from their ranks an increasing number of talented agitators, but also of talented organisers, propagandists and “practical workers” in the best sense of the term (of whom there are so few among our intelligentsia who, in the majority of cases, are somewhat careless and sluggish in their habits, so characteristic of Rus­ sians).
When wc have detachments of specially trained working class revolutionaries who have gone through long years of pre­ paration (and, of course, revolutionaries “of all arms”), no political police in die world will be able to contend against them, for these detachments of men absolutely devoted and loyal to the revolution will themselves enjoy the absolute con­ fidence and devotion of the broad masses of the workers.
The sin we commit is that we do not sufficiently “stimulate” the workers to take this path, “common” to them and to the “intel­ lectuals,” of professional revolutionary training, and that we too frequently drag them back by our silly speeches about what “can be understood” by the masses of the workers, by the “average workers,” etc.
In this, as in other cases, the narrowness of our field of organisational work is without a doubt directly due (although the overwhelming majority of the Economists and the novices in practical work do not appreciate it) to the fact that we restrict our theories and our political tasks to a narrow field.
Subservience to spontaneity seems to inspire a fear of taking even one step away from what “can be understood” by the masses, a fear of rising too high above mere subservience to the immediate requirements of the masses.
Have no fear, gentle­ men! Remember tliat we stand so low on the plane of organ­ isation that the very idea that we could rise too high is absurd! E.
“Conspiiutive” Organisation and “Democracy” There are many people among us who are so sensitive to the “voice of life” that they fear it more than anything in the world and accuse those who adhere to the views here ex­ pounded of “Narodovolism,” of failing to understand “dem­ ocracy,” etc.
We must deal with these accusations, which, of course, have been echoed by Rabocheye Dyelo.
The writer of these lines knows very well that the St.
Peters­ burg Economists accused Rabochaya Gazeta of being Narodovol-ist (which is quite understandable when one compares it with Rabochaya My si).
We wrere not in the least surprised, there­ fore.
when, soon after the appearance of Iskra, a comrade in­ formed us that the Social-Democrats in the town of X describe Iskra as a Narodovolist journal.
We, of course, were flattered by this accusation.
What real Social-Democrat has not been ac­ cused by the Economists of being a Narodovolist? These accusalions are called forth by a twofold misunder­ standing.
First, the history of the revolutionary movement is so little known among us that the very idea of a militant centralised organisation which declares a determined war upon tsarism is described as Narodovolist.
But the magnificent org­ anisation that the revolutionaries had in the ’seventies, and which should serve us all as a model, was not formed by the Narodovolists but by the adherents of Zemlya i Volya,1 who split up into Chernoperedelisls1 2 and Narodovolisls.
Conse­ quently, to regard a militant revolutionary organisation as something specifically Narodovolist is absurd both historically and logically, because no revolutionary tendency, if it seriously thinks of fighting, can dispense with such an organisation.
But the mistake the Narodovolists committed was not that they strove to recruit to their organisation all the discontented, and to hurl this organisation into the decisive battle against the autocracy; on the contrary, that was their great historical merit.
Their mistake was that they relied on a theory which in sub­ stance was not a revolutionary theory at all, and they either did not know how, or circumstances did not permit them, to link up their movement inseparably with the class struggle that went on within developing capitalist society.
And only a gross failure to understand Marxism (or an “understanding” of it in the spirit of Struve-ism) could prompt the opinion that the rise of a mass, spontaneous labour movement relieves us of the duty of creating as good an organisation of revolution­ aries as Zemlya i Volya had in its time, and even an incom­ parably better one.
On the contrary, this movement imposes this duty upon us, because the spontaneous struggle of the proletariat will not become a genuine “class struggle” until it is led by a strong organisation of revolutionaries.
Secondly, many, including apparently B.
Krichevsky (Raboch-eye Dvelo>> No.

18), misunderstand the polemics that Social-Democrats have always waged against the “conspirative” 1Lund and Freedom,—Ed.

view of the political struggle.
We have always protested, and will, of course, continue to protest against restricting the polit­ ical struggle to conspiracies? But this does not, of course, mean that we deny the need for a strong revolutionary organisation.
And in the pamphlet mentioned in the preceding footnote, after the polemics against reducing the political struggle to a con­ spiracy, a description is given (as a Social-Democratic ideal) of an organisation so strong as to be able to “resort to rebel­ lion” and to “every other form of attack,” in order to “de­ liver a smashing blow against absolutism.
”1 2 * * * * * According to its form, a strong revolutionary organisation of that kind in an au­ tocratic country may also be described as a “conspirative” organ­ isation, because the French word “conspiration” means in Rus-sion “conspiracy,” and we must have the utmost conspiracy 8 for an organisation of that kind.
Secrecy is such a necessary con­ dition for such an organisation that all the other conditions (number and selection of members, functions, etc.
) must all be subordinated to it.
It would be extremely naive indeed, therefore, 1 Cf.

we shall give another illustration of the fact that Ra-bocheye Dyelo either does not understand what it is talking about, or changes its views “with every change in the wind.
” In No.
1 of Rabocheye Dyelo, we find the following passage in italics: “The sum and substance of the views expressed in this pamphlet coincide entirely with the editorial programme of *Rabocheye Dyelo.
9” (P.
142.
) Is that so.
indeed? Does the view that the mass movement must not he set the primary task of overthrowing the autocracy coincide with the views ex­ pressed in the pamnhlet.
The Tasks of Russian Social-Democrats? Do “the economic struggle against the employers and the government” theory and the stages theory coincide with the views expressed in that pamphlet? We leave it to the reader to judge whether an organ which understands the meaning of “coincidence” in this peculiar manner can have firm principles.
8 The Russian word for “conspiracy” is zagovor, which means “con­ spiracy” or “plot.
” But the word conspiratsiya, “conspiracy,” in Russian revolutionary literature usually means “secrecy.
” Hence, a conspirative organisation would be a secret organisation, but would not necessarily engage in plots.
Except in this case, when it was important to hring out the piny of words, the word “conspiratsiya” has heen rendered throughout the text as “secrecy,” and the word “conspirative” has been used only where the word zagovor was used in the text, as in the subtitle of this section.

to fear the accusation that we Social Democrats desire to create a conspirative organisation.
Such an accusation would be as flattering to every opponent of Economism as the accusation of being followers of Narodovolism would be.
Against us it will be argued: such a powerful and strictly secret organisation, which concentrates in its hands all the threads of secret activities, an organisation which of necessity must be a centralised organisation, may too easily throw itself into a premature attack, may thoughtlessly intensify the move­ ment before political discontent, the ferment and anger of the working class, etc.
, are sufficiently ripe for it To this we reply: speaking abstractly, it cannot be denied, of course, that a mil­ itant organisation may thoughtlessly commence a battle, which may end in defeat, which might have been avoided under other circumstances.
But we cannot confine ourselves to abstract rea­ soning on such a question, because every battle bears within itself the abstract possibility of defeat, and there is no other way of reducing this possibility than by organised preparation for battle.
If, however, we base our argument on the concrete conditions prevailing in Russia at the present time, wTe must come to the positive conclusion that a strong revolutionary organisation is absolutely necessary precisely for the purpose of giving firmness to the movement, and of safeguarding it against the possibility of its making premature attacks.
It is precisely at the present time, when no such organisation exists yet, and when the revolutionary movement is rapidly and spon­ taneously growing, that we already observe two opposite ex­ tremes (which, as is to be expected, “meet”), i.
e.
, absolutely unsound Economism and the preaching of moderation, and equally unsound “excitative terror,” which strives artificially to “call forth symptoms of its end in a movement which is devel­ oping and becoming strong, but which is as yet nearer to its beginning than to its end?’ (V.
Zasulich, in Zarya, No.
2-3, p.
353.
) And the example of Rabocheye Dyelo shows that there are already Social-Democrats who give way to both these ex­ tremes.
This is not surprising because, apart from otlier rea­ sons, the “economic struggle against the employers and the government” can never satisfy revolutionaries, and because op­ posite extremes will always arise here and there.
Only a cen­ tralised, militant organisation that consistently carries out a Social-Democratic policy, that satisfies, so to speak, all revolu­ tionary instincts and strivings, can safeguard the movement against making thoughtless attacks and prepare it for attacks that hold out the promise of success.
Il will be further argued against us that the views on organ­ isation here expounded contradict the “principles of democracy.
” Now while the first-mentioned accusation was of purely Rus­ sian origin, this one is of purely foreign origin.
And only an organisation abroad (the League of Russian Social-Democrats) would be capable of giving its editorial board instructions like the following: “Principles of Organisation.
In order to secure the successful develop­ ment and unification of Social-Democracy, broad democratic principles of Party organisation must be emphasised, developed and fought for; and this is particularly necessary in view of the anti-democratic tenden­ cies that have become revealed in the ranks of our Party.
” (Two Con-gresses, p.
18.
) We shall see how Rabochcye Dyelo fights against Iskras “anti-democratic tendencies” in the next chapter.
Here we shall examine more closely the “principle” that the Economists ad­ vance.
Everyone will probably agree that “broad democratic principles” presuppose the two following conditions: first, full publicity, and second, election to all functions.
It would be absurd to speak about democracy without publicity, that is, a publicity that extends beyond the circle of the member­ ship of the organisation.
We call the German Socialist Party a democratic organisation because all it does is done publicly; even its Party congresses are held in public.
But no one would call an organisation that is hidden from every one but its members by a veil of secrecy, a democratic organisation.
What is the use of advancing “broad democratic principles” when the fundamental condition for these principles cannot be fulfilled by a secret organisation? “Broad principles” turns out to be a resonant but hollow phrase.
More that that, this phrase proves that the urgent tasks in regard to organisation are totally mis-understood.
Everyone knows how great is the lack of secrecy among the “broad” masses of revolutionaries.
We have heard the bitter complaints of B------v on this score, and his absolutely just demand for a “strict selection of members.
” (Rabocheye Dyelo, No, 6, p.
42.
) And people who boast about their “sen­ sitiveness to life” come forward in a situation like this, and urge, not strict secrecy and a strict (and therefore more re­ stricted) selection of members but “broad democratic prin­ ciples”! This is what we call being absolutely wide of the mark.
Nor is the situation with regard to the second attribute of democracy, namely, the principle of election, any better.
In politically free countries, this condition is taken for granted.
“Membership of the Party is open to those who accept the principles of the Party programme, and render all the sup­ port they can to the Party”—says point 1 of the rules of the German Social-Democratic Party.
And as the political arena is as open to the public view as is the stage in a theatre, this acceptance or non-acceptance, support or opposition, is known to all from the press and public meetings.
Everyone knows that a certain political worker commenced in a certain way, passed through a certain evolution, behaved in difficult periods in a certain way and possesses certain qualities and, consequently, knowing all the facts of the case, every Party member can de­ cide for himself whether or not to elect this person for a certain Party office.
The general control (in the literal sense of the term) that the Party exercises over every act this person commits in the political field brings into existence an automat­ ically operating mechanism which brings about what in biol­ ogy is called “survival of the fittest.
” “Natural selection” of full publicity, the principle of election and general control pro­ vide the guarantee that, in the last analysis, every political worker will be “in his proper place,” will do the work for which he is best fitted by his strength and abilities, will feel the effects of his mistakes on himself, and prove before all the world his ability to recognise mistakes and to avoid them.
• Try to put this picture in the frame of our autocracy! Is it possible in Russia for all those “who accept the principles of the Party programme and render all the support they can to the Party” to control every action of the revolutionary working in secret? Is it possible for all the revolutionaries to elect one of their number to any particular office, when, in the very in­ terests of the work, he must conceal his identity from nine out of ten of these “all”? Ponder a little over the real mean­ ing of the high-sounding phrases that Rabocheye Dyelo gives utterance to, and you will realise that “broad democracy” in Party organisation, amidst the gloom of autocracy and the dom­ ination of gendarme selection, is nothing more than a useless and harmful toy.
It is a useless toy because, as a matter of fact, no revolutionary organisation has ever practised broad democracy, nor could it, however much it desired to do so.
It is a harmful toy because any attempt to practise the “broad democratic principles” will simply facilitate the work of the police in making big raids, it will perpetuate the prevail­ ing primitiveness, divert the thoughts of tire practical workers from the serious and imperative task of training themselves to become professional revolutionaries to that of drawing up detailed “paper” rules for election systems.
Only abroad, where very often people who have no opportunity of doing real live work gather together, can the “game of democracy” be played here and there, especially in small groups.
In order to show how improper Rabocheye Dyelo* s favourite trick is of advancing the implausible “principle” of democracy in revolutionary affairs, we shall again call a witness.
This witness, E.
Serebryakov, the editor of the London magazine, Nakanunye, has a tender feeling for Rabocheye Dyelo, and is filled with hatred against Plekhanov and the Piekhanovists.
In articles that it published on the split in the League of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, Nakanunye definitely took the side of Rabocheye Dyelo and poured a stream of despicable abuse upon Plekhanov.
But this only makes this wit­ ness all the more valuable for us on this question.
In No.
7 of Nakanunye (July 1899), in an article entitled “The Mani­ festo of the Self-Emancipation of the Workers Group,” E.
Ser­ ebryakov argues that it was “indecent” to talk about such things as “self-deception, priority and so-called Areopagus in a serious revolutionary movement.
” and inter alia wrote: “Myshkin, Rogachev, Zhelyabov, Mikhailov, Perovskaya, Figncr and others never regarded themselves as leaders, and no one ever elected or ap­ pointed them as such, although as a matter of fact, they were leaders because, in the propaganda period, as well as in the period of the fight against the government, they took the brunt of the work upon them­ selves, they went into the most dangerous places and their activities were the most fruitful.
Leadership came to them not because they wished it, but because the comrades surrounding them had confidence in their wisdom, their energy and loyally.
To be afraid of some kind of Areo­ pagus [if it is not feared, why write about it?] that would arbitrarily govern the movement is far too naive.
Who would obey it?” We ask the reader, in what way does “Areopagus” differ from “anti-democratic tendencies”? And is it not endent that Rabocheye Dyelo’s “plausible” organisational principle is equal­ ly naive and indecent; naive, because no one would obey “Areo­ pagus,” or people with “anti-democratic tendencies,” if “the comrades surrounding them had” no “confidence in their wis­ dom, energy and loyalty”; indecent, because it is a demagogic sally calculated to play on the conceit of some, on the ignorance of the actual state of our movement on the part of others, and on tire lack of training and ignorance of the history of the revolu­ tionary movement of still others.
The only serious organisa­ tional principle the active workers of our movement can accept if strict secrecy, strict selection of members and the training of professional revolutionaries.
If we possessed these qualities, something even more than “democracy” would be guaranteed to us, namely, complete, comradely, mutual confidence among revolutionaries.
And this is absolutely essential for us because in Russia it is useless thinking that democratic control can serve as a substitute for it.
It would be a great mistake to be­ lieve that because it is impossible to establish real “democratic” control, the members of the revolutionary organisation will re­ main altogether uncontrolled.
They have not the time to think about the toy forms of democracy (democracy within a close and compact body of comrades in which complete, mutual con­ Science prevails), but they have a lively sense of their respon­ sibility, because they know from experience that an organisa­ tion of real revolutionaries will stop at nothing to irid itself of an undesirable member.
Moreover, tliere is a fairly well-developed public opinion in Russian (and international) revolutionary circles which has a long history behind it, and which sternly and ruthlessly punishes every departure from the duties of comradeship (and does not “democracy,” real and not toy democracy, form a pari of the conception of comradeship?).
Take all this into consideration and you will realise t!ia>t all the talk and resolutions about “anti-democratic tendencies” has the fetid odour of the game of generals that is played abroad.
It must be observed also that the other source of this talk, i.
e.
, naivete, is likewise fostered by the confusion of ideas concern­ ing the meaning of democracy.
In Mr.
and Mrs.
Webb’s book on trade unionism,1 there is an interesting chapter entitled “Primi­ tive Democracy.
” In this chapter, the authors relate how, in the first period of existence of their unions, the British workers thought that it was an indispensable sign of democracy for all the members to do all the work of managing the unions; not only were all questions decided by the votes of all the members, but all the official duties were fulfilled by all Hie members in turn.
A long period of historical experience was required to teach these workers how absurd such a conception of democracy was and to make them understand the necessity for representative institutions on the one hand, and for full-time professional officials on the other.
Only after a number of oases of financial bankruptcy of trade unions occurred did the work­ ers realise that rates of contributions and benefits cannot be decided merely by a democratic vote, but must be based on the advice of insurance experts.
Let us take also Kautsky’s book on parliamentarism and legislation by the people.
There you will find that the conclusions drawn by the Marxian theoreti­ cian coincide with the lessons learned from many years of ex­ perience by the workers who organised “spontaneously.
” Kautsky strongly protests against Rittinghausen’s primitive conception of 'The History of Trade Unionism.

democracy; he ridicules those who in the name of democracy demand that “popular newspapers shall be directly edited by the people”; he shows the need for professional journalists, parliamentarians, etc.
, for the Social-Democratic leadership of the proletarian class struggle; he attacks the “socialism of anarchists and litterateurs” who in their “striving after effect” proclaim the principle that laws should be passed directly by die whole people, completely failing to understand that in modem society this principle can have only a relative appli­ cation.
Those who have carried on practical work in our movement know how widespread is the “primitive” conception of democ­ racy among the masses of the students and workers.
It is not surprising that this conception permeates rules of organisation and literature.
The Economists of the Bernstein persuasion in­ cluded in their rules the following: “§ 10.
All affairs affect­ ing the interests of the whole of the union organisation shall be decided by a majority vote of all its members.
” The Economists of the terrorist persuasion repeat after them: “The decisions of the committee must be circulated among all the circles and become effective only after this has been done.
” (Svoboda, No.
1, p.
67.
) Observe that this proposal for a widely applied referendum is advanced in addition to the demand that the whole of the organisation be organised on an elective basis! tfe would not, of course, on this account condemn practical workers who have had too few opportunities for studying the theory and practice of real democratic organisation.
But when Rabochoye Dyelo, which claims to play a leading role, confines itself, under such conditions, to resolutions about broad dem­ ocratic principles, how else can it be described than as a mere “striving after effect”? F.
Local and All-Russian Work Although the objections raised against the plan for an org­ anisation outlined here on the grounds of its undemocratic and conspirative character are totally unsound, nevertheless, a question still remains which is frequently put and which deserves detailed examination.
This is the question about the relations between local work and all-Russian work.
Fears are expressed that the formation of a centralised organisation would shift the centre of gravity from the former to the latter; that this would damage the movement, would weaken our contacts with the masses of the workers, and would weaken local agitation generally.
To these fears we reply that our movement in the past few years has suffered precisely from the fact that the local workers have been too absorbed in local work.
Hence it is absolutely necessary to shift the weight of the work some­ what from local work to national work.
This would not weaken, on the contrary, it would strengthen our ties and the continu­ ity of our local agitation.
Take the question of central and local journals.
I would ask the reader not to forget that we cite the publication of journals only as an example, illustrating an immeasurably broader, more widespread and varied revo­ lutionary activity.
In the first period of the mass movement (1896-98), an at­ tempt is made by local Party workers to publish an all-Russian journal, Rabcchaya Gazela, In the next period (1898-1900), the movement makes enormous strides, but the attention of the leaders is wholly absorbed by local publications.
If we count up all the local journals that were published, we shall find that on the average one paper per month was published.
1 Does this not illustrate our primitive ways? Does this not clearly show that our revolutionary organisation lags behind the spontaneous growth of the movement? If the same number of issues had been published, not by scattered local groups, but by a single organisation, we would not only have saved an enormous amount of effort, but we would have secured immeasurably greater sta­ bility and continuity in our work.
This simple calculation is very frequently lost sight of by those practical workers who work actively, almost exclusively, on local publications (un­ fortunately this is the case even now in the overwhelming ma-1See Report to the Paris Congress, p.
14.
* “From that time (18971 to the spring of 1900, thirty issues of various papers were published in vaiious places.
.
.
.
On an average, over one number per month was pub­ lished.
” jority of cases), as well as by the publicists who display an astonishing quixotism on this question.
The practical workers usually rest content with the argument that “it is difficult” for local workers to engage in the organisation of an all-Russian newspaper, and that local newspapers are better than no news­ papers at all.
1 The latter argument is, of course, perfectly just, and we shall not yield to any practical worker in our re­ cognition of the enormous importance and usefulness of local newspapers in general.
But this is not the point.
The point is, can we rid ourselves of the state of diffusion and primitiveness that is so strikingly expressed in the thirty numbers of local newspapers published throughout the whole of Russia in the course of two and a half years? Do not restrict yourselves to indisputable, but too general, statements about the usefulness of local newspapers generally; have the courage also openly to admit the defects that have been revealed by the experi­ ence of two and a half years.
This experience has shown that under the conditions in which we wTork, these local newspapers prove, in the majority of cases, to be unstable in their prin­ ciples, lacking in political significance, extremely costly in re­ gard to expenditure of revolutionary forces, and totally un­ satisfactory from a technical point of view (I have in mind, of course, not the technique of printing them, but the fre­ quency and regularity of publication).
These defects arc not accidental; they are the inevitable result of the diffusion which on the one hand explains the predominance of local newspapers in the period under review, and on the other hand is fostered by this predominance.
A separate local organisation is positively unable to maintain stability of principles in its newspaper and raise it to the level of a political organ; it is unable to collect and utilise sufficient material dealing with the whole of our political life.
While in politically free countries it is often argued in defence of numerous local newspapers that the cost of printing by local workers is low and that the local popula-1 This difficulty is more apparent than real.
As a matter of fact, there is not a single local circle that lacks the opportunity of taking up some function or other in connection with all-Russian work.
“Don’t say: I can’t; say: I won’t.
” lion can be kept more fully and quickly informed, experience has shown that in Russia this argument can be used against local newspapers.
In Russia, local newspapers prove to be ex­ cessively costly in regard to the expenditure of revolutionary forces, and appear very rarely, for the very simple reason that no matter how small its size, the publication of an illegal newspaper requires a large secret apparatus such as requires large factory production; for such an apparatus cannot be cre­ ated in a small, handicraft workshop.
Very frequently, the prim­ itiveness of the secret apparatus (every practical worker knows of numerous cases like this) enables the police to take advantage of the publication and distribution of one or two numbers to make mass arrests, which make such a clean sweep that it is necessary afterwards to start all over again.
A well-organised secret apparatus requires professionally well-trained revolution­ aries and proper division of labour, but neither of these re­ quirements can be met by separate local organisations, no mat­ ter how strong they may be at any given moment.
Not only are the general interests of our movement as a whole (train­ ing of the workers in consistent socialist and political prin­ ciples) better served by non-local newspapers, but so also are even specifically local interests.
This may seem paradoxical at first sight, but it has been proved up to the hilt by the two and a half years of experience to which we have already referred.
Everyone will agree that if all the local forces that were engaged in the publication of these thirty issues of newspapers had worked on a single newspaper, they could easily have pub­ lished sixty if not a hundred numbers and, consequently, would have more fully expressed all the specifically local features of the movement.
True, it is not an easy matter to attain such a high degree of organisation, but we must realise the need for it.
Every local circle must think about it, and work active­ ly to achieve it, without waiting to be pushed on from outside; and we must stop being tempted by the easiness and closer proximity of a local newspaper which, as our revolutionary experience has shown, proves to a large extent to be illusory.
And it is a had service indeed those publicists render to the practical work who, thinking they stand particularly close to the practical workers, fail to see this illusoriness, and make shift with the astonishingly cheap and astonishingly hollow argument: we must have local newspapers, we must have dis­ trict newspapers and we must have all-Russian newspapers.
Generally speaking, of course, all these are necessary, but when you undertake to solve a concrete organisational problem, surely you must take time and circumstances into consideration.
Is it not quixotic on the part of Svoboda (No.
1, p.
68), in a special article “dealing with the question of a newspaper" to write: “It seems to us that every locality, where any number of workers are collected, should have its own labour news­ paper; not a newspaper imported from somewhere or other, but its very own.
” If the publicist who wrote that refuses to think about the significance of his own words, then at least you, reader, think about it for him.
How many scores, if not hundreds, of “localities where any number of workers are collected” are there in Russia, and would it not be simply perpetuating our primitive methods if indeed every local organ­ isation set to work to publish its own newspaper? How this diffusion would facilitate the task of the gendarmes of fishing out—without any considerable effort at that—the local Party workers at the very beginning of their activity and preventing them from developing into real revolutionaries! A reader of an all-Russian newspaper, continues the author, would not find descriptions of the malpractices of the factory owners and the “details of factory life in other towns outside his district at all interesting.
” Rut “an inhabitant of Orel would not find it dull reading about Ore) affairs.
Each time he picked up his paper he wrould learn that some factory owner had been ‘caught* and another ‘exposed,’ and his spirits would begin to soar.
” (P.
69.
) Yes, yes, the spirit of the Orelian would begin to soar, but the thoughts of our publicist are also beginning to soar—too high.
He should have asked himself: is it right to concern oneself en­ tirely with defending the striving after petty reforms? We are second to none in our appreciation of the importance and necessity of factory exposures, but it must be borne in mind 11 Leriin H that we have reached a stage when St.
Petersburgians find it dull reading the St.
Petersburg correspondence of the St.
Peters­ burg Rabochaya My si.
Local factory exposures have always been and should always continue to be made through the med­ ium of leaflets, but we must raise the level of the newspaper, and not degrade it to the level of a factory leaflet.
We do not require ‘‘petty” exposures for our “newspaper.
” We require exposures of the important, typical evils of factory life, ex­ posures based on the most striking facts and capable of inter­ esting all workers and all leaders of the movement, capable of really enriching their knowledge, widening their outlook, and cf rousing new districts and new professional strata of the workers.
“Moreover, in a local newspaper, the malpractices of the fac­ tory officials and other authorities may be seized upon immedi­ ately, and they may be caught red-handed.
In the case of a gen­ eral newspaper, however, by the time the news reaches the paper and by the time they are published the facts will have been for­ gotten in the localities in which they occurred.
The reader, when he gets the paper, will say: ‘God knows when that happened!’” (Ibid.
) Exactly! God knows when it happened.
As we know from the source I have already quoted, during two and a half years, thirty issues of newspapers were published in six cities.
This, on die average, is one issue per city per half year.
And even if our frivolous publicist trebled his estimate of the pro­ ductivity of local work (which would be wrong in the case of an average city, because it is impossible to increase productivity to any extent by our primitive methods), we would still get only one issue every two months, i.
e.
, nothing at all like “catch­ ing them red-handed.
” It would be sufficient, however, to com­ bine a score or so of local organisations, and assign active functions to their delegates in organising a general newspaper, to enable us to “catch” over the whole of Russia, not petty, but really outstanding and typical evils once every fortnight No one who has any knowledge at all of the state of affairs in our organisations can have the slightest doubt about that.
It is quite absurd to talk about an illegal newspaper catching the enemy red-handed, that is, if we mean it seriously and not merely as a metaphor.
That can only be done ty a surrep­ titious leaflet, because an incident like that can only be of in­ terest for a matter of a day or two (lake, for example, the usual brief strikes, beatings in a factory, demonstrations, etc.
).
“The workers not only live in factories, they also live in the cities,” continues our author, rising from the particular to the general, with a strict consistency that would have done honour to Boris Krichevsky himself; and he refers to matters like city councils, city hospitals, city schools, and demands that labour newspapers should not ignore municipal affairs in general.
This demand is an excellent one in itself, but it serves as a remark­ able illustration of the empty abstraction which too frequently characterises discussions about local newspapers.
First of all, if indeed newspapers appeared “in every locality where any number of workers are collected” with such detailed informa­ tion on municipal affairs as Svoboda desires, it wrould, under our Russian conditions, inevitably degenerate into a striving for petty reforms, would lead to a weakening of the consciousness of the importance of an all-Russian revolutionary attack upon the tsarist autocracy, and would strengthen those extremely vi­ rile shoots of the tendency—not uprooted but rather temporarily suppressed—which has already become notorious as a result of the famous remark about revolutionaries who talk a great deal about non-existent parliaments and too little about existing city councils.
We say “inevitably” deliberately, in order to emphasise that Svoboda obviously does not want this but the contrary to happen.
But good intentions are not enough.
In order that municipal affairs may be dealt with in their proper perspective, in relation to the whole of our work, this perspective must first be clearly conceived; it must be firmly established, not only by argument, but by numerous examples, in order that it may ac­ quire the firmness of a tradition.
This is far from being the case with us yet.
And yet this must be done first, before wc can even think and talk about an extensive local press.
Secondly, in order to be able to write well and interestingly about municipal affairs, one must know these questions not only if from books.
And there are hardly any Social-Democrats any­ where in Russia who possess this knowledge.
In order to be able to write in newspapers (not in popular pamphlets) about municipal and state affairs, one must have fresh and multifarious material collected and worked up by able journal­ ists.
And in order to be able to collect and work up such material, we must have something more than the “primitive democracy” of a primitive circle, in which everybody does everything and all entertain one another by playing at ref­ erendums.
For this it is necessary to have a staff of expert writers, expert correspondents, an army of Social-Democratic reporters that has established contacts far and wide, able to penetrate into all sorts of “state secrets” (about which the Russian government official is so puffed up, but which he so easily blabs), find its way “behind the scenes,” an army of men and women whose “official duty” it must be to be ubiquitous and omniscient.
And we, the party that fights against all economic, political, social and national oppression, can and must find, collect, train, mobilise and set into motion such an army of omniscient people—but all this has yet to be done! Not only has not a single step been taken towards this in the overwhelming majority of localities, but in many cases the nec­ essity for doing it is not even realised.
Search our Social-Democratic press for lively and interesting articles, correspond­ ence, and exposures of our diplomatic, military, ecclesiastical, municipal, financial, etc.
, etc.
, affairs and malpractices! You will find almost nothing, or very little, about these things.
1 That 1 That is why even examples of exceptionally good local newspapers fully confirm our point of view.
For example, Yuzhny Rabachy [Southern Worker} is an excellent newspaper, and is altogether free from instability of principles.
But it has been unable to provide what it desired for the local movement, owing to the infrequency of its publication and to exten­ sive police raids.
What our Party most urgently requires, at the present time, viz.
, the presentation of the fundamental questions of the movement and wide political agitation, the local newspaper has been unable to satisfy.
And the material it has published exceptionally well, like the articles about the mine owners’ congress, unemployment, etc.
, was not strictly local ma­ terial, it was required for the whole of Russia, and not for the South alone.
No articles like that have appeared in any of our Social-Democratic newspapers.
is why “It always frightfully annoys me when a man comes to me and utters beautiful and charming fords’’ about the need for newspapers that will expose factory, municipal and govern­ ment evils “in every locality where any number of workers are collected”! The predominance of the local press over the central press may be either a symptom of poverty or a symptom of luxury.
Of poverty, when the movement has not yet developed the forces for large-scale production, and continues to flounder in primitive ways and in “the petty details of factory life.
” Of luxury, when the movement has already jully mastered the task of all-sided exposure and all-sided agitation and it becomes nec­ essary to publish numerous local newspapers in addition to the central organ.
Let each one decide for himself what the pre­ dominance of local newspapers implies at the present time.
I shall limit myself to a precise formulation of my own conclusion in order to avoid misunderstanding.
Hitherto, the majority of our local organisations have been thinking almost exclusively of local newspapers, and have devoted almost all their activ­ ities to these.
This is unsound—the very opposite should be the case.
The majority of the local organisations should think principally of the publication of an all-Russian newspaper, and devote their activities principally to it Until this is done, we shall never be able to establish a single newspaper capable, to any degree, of serving the movement with all-sided press agi­ tation.
When it is done, however, normal relations between the necessary central newspapers and the necessary local news­ papers will be established automatically.
• • • It would seem at first sight that the conclusion drawn con­ cerning the necessity for transferring the weight of effort from local work to all-Russian work does not apply to the sphere of the specifically economic struggle.
In this struggle, the im­ mediate enemy of the workers is the individual employer or group of employers, who are not bound by any organisation having even the remotest resemblance to the purely militant, strictly centralised organisation of the Russian government which is guided even in its jninutest details by a single will, and which is our immediate enemy in the political struggle.
But that is not the case.
As we have already pointed out many times, the economic struggle is a trade struggle, and for that reason it requires that the workers be organised according to trade and not only according to their place of employment.
And this organisation by trade becomes all the more impera­ tively necessary, the more rapidly our employers organise in all sorts of companies and syndicates.
Our state of diffusion and our primitiveness hinder this work of organisation, and in order that this work may be carried out we must have a single, all­ Russian organisation of revolutionaries capable of undertaking the leadership of the all-Russian trade unions.
We have already described above the type of organisation that is desired for this purpose, and now we shall add just a few words about this in connection with the question of our press.
Hardly anyone will doubt the necessity for every Social-Democratic newspaper having a special section devoted to the trade union (economic) struggle.
But the growth of the trade union movement compels us to think also about the trade union press.
It seems to us, however, that with rare exceptions it is not much use thinking of trade union newspapers in Russia at the present time; that would be a luxury, and in many places we cannot even obtain our daily bread.
The form of trade union press that would suit the conditions of our illegal work and is al­ ready called for at the present lime is the trade union pam­ phlet.
In these pamphlets, legal1 and illegal material should 1 Legal material is particularly important in this connection, but we have lagged behind, very much in our ability systematically to collect and utilise it.
It would not be an exaggeration to say that legal material alone would be sufficient for a trade union pamphlet, whereas illegal material alone would not he sufficient.
In illegal material collected from workers on questions like those dealt with in the publications of Raboch-aya Mysl, we waMe a lot of the efforts of revolutionaries (whose place in this work could very easily be taken by legal workers), and yet we never obtain good material because a worker who knows only a single department of a large factory, who knows the economic results but not the general conditions and standards of his work, cannot acquire the knowledge which is possessed by the office staff of a factory, by inspectors, be collected and grouped systematically, on conditions of la­ bour in a given trade, on the various conditions prevailing in the various parts of Russia, on the principal demands ad­ vanced by the workers in a given trade, on the defects of the laws in relation to that trade, on the outstanding cases of workers’ economic struggle in this trade, on the rudiments, the present state and the requirements of their trade union or­ ganisations, etc.
Such pamphlets would, in the first place, re­ lieve our Social-Democratic press of a mass of trade details that interest only the workers employed in the given trade; sec­ ondly, they would record the results of our experience in the trade union struggle, would preserve the material collected— which is now literally lost in a mass of leaflets and fragment­ ary correspondence—and would generalise this material.
Third­ ly, they could serve as material for the guidance of agitators, because conditions of labour change relatively slowly and the principal demands of the workers in a given trade hardly ever change (see, for example, the demands advanced by the weavers in the Moscow district in 1885 and in the St.
Petersburg dis­ trict in 1896); a compilation of these demands and needs might serve for years as an excellent handbook for agitators on economic questions-in backward localities or among back­ ward strata of the workers.
Examples of successful strikes, in­ formation about the higher standard of living, about better con­ ditions of labour in one district, would encourage the workers in other districts to take up the fight again and again.
Fourthly, having made a start in generalising the trade union struggle, and doctors, etc.
, and which is scattered in petty newspaper correspondence, and in special, industrial, medical.
Zemstvo and other publications.
I very distinctly remember my “first experiment,** which.
I would never like to repeat.
I spent many weeks “examining” 8 workingman who came to risit me, about the conditions prevailing in the enormous factory at which he was employed.
True, after great effort, I managed to obtain material for a description (of just one single factory!), but at the end of the interview the workingman would wipe the sweat from his brow, and say to me smilingly: “I would rather work overtime than reply to your questions!” The more energetically we carry on our revolutionary struggle, the more the government will be compelled to legalise a part of the “trade union” work, and by that relieve us of part of our burden.
having in this way strengthened the contacts between the Russian trade union movement and socialism, the Social-Democrats would at the same time see to it that our trade union work did not take up either too small or too large a part of our general Social-Democratic work.
A local organisation that is cut off from the organisations in other towns finds it very dif­ ficult, and sometimes almost impossible, to maintain a correct sense of proportion (and the example of Rabochaya Mysl shows what a monstrous exaggeration is sometimes made in the direction of trade unionism).
But an all-Russian organisation of revolutionaries, that stands undevialingly on the basis of Marxism, that leads the whole of the political struggle and possesses a staff of professional agitators, will never find it difficult to determine the proper proportion.
V THE “PLAN” FOR AN ALL-RUSSIAN POLITICAL NEWSPAPER “The most serious blunder Iskra committed in this connection,” writes B.
Krichevsky (Rabocheye Dyelo, No.
10, p.
30)—ac­ cusing us of betraying a tendency to “convert theory into a lifeless doctrine by isolating it from practice”—“was in promot­ ing its ‘plan’ for a general Party organisation” (i.
e.
, the article entitled “Where to Begin?”) and Martynov echoes this idea by declaring that “Iskra's tendency to belittle the forward march of the drab every-day struggle in comparison with the propaganda of brilliant and complete ideas .
.
.
was crowned by the plan for the organisation of a party that it advances in an article in No.
4, entitled ‘Where to Begin?’.
” (Ibid.
, p.
61.
) Finally, L.
Na­ dezhdin recently joined in the chorus of indignation against this “plan” (the quotation marks were meant to express sar­ casm).
In a pamphlet we have just received written by him, entitled The Eve of the Re volution (published by the Revolu­ tionary Socialist group, Svoboda, whose acquaintance we have already made), he declares: “To speak now of an organisation linked up with an all-Russian newspaper means propagating armchair ideas and armchair work” (p.
126), that it is a man­ ifestation of “literariness,” etc.
It does not surprise us that our terrorist agrees with the champions of the “forward march of the drab every-day strug­ gle,” because we have already traced the roots of this intimacy between them in the chapters on politics and organisation.
But we must here draw attention to the fact that L.
Nadezhdin is the only one who has conscientiously tried to understand the ideas expressed in an article he disliked, and has made an attempt to 169 reply to the point, whereas Rabocheye Dyelo has said nothing that is material to the subject, but has only tried to confuse the question by a whole series of indecent, demagogic sallies.
Unpleasant though the task may be, we must first spend some time in cleaning this Augean stable.
B.
1 Can a Newspaper Be a Collective Organiser? The main points in the article “Where to Begin?” deal pre­ cisely with this question, and reply to it in the affirmative.
As far as we know, the only attempt to examine this question and to prove that it must be answered in the negative was made by L.
Nadezhdin, whose argument wc reproduce in full: “.
.
.
The manner in which the question of the need for an all-Russian newspaper is presented in Iskra, No.
4.
pleases us very much, but we cannot agree that such a presentation fits in with the title of the article ‘Where to Begin?* Undoubtedly this is an extremely im­ portant matter, but neither a newspaper, nor a whole series of popular leaflets, nor a whole mountain of manifestoes, can serve as the basis for a militant organisation in revolutionary times.
We must Ret to work to build up strong political organisations in the localities.
We lack such organisations: we have been carrying on our work mainly among intel­ ligent workers, while the masses have been engaged almost exclusively in the economic struggle.
If wc do not build up strong political organ­ isations locally, what will be the use of even an excellently organised all-Russian newspaper? It will be a burning bush, burning without being consumed, and inflaming nobody.
Iskra thinks that as a matter of fact people will gather around it, and they will organise.
But they will find it more interesting to gather and organise around something more con­ crete' This something more concrete may be the extensive publication of local newspapers, the immediate setting to work to rally the forces of labour for demonstrations, constant work by local organisations among the unemployed (regularly distribute pamphlets and leaflets among them, convene meetings for them, cal! upon them to resist the government, etc.
).
We must organise live political work in the localities, and when the time comes to amalgamate on this real basis, it will not be an arti­ ficial, a paper amalgamation: it will not be by means of newspapers that such an amalgamation of local work into an all-Russian cause will be achieved!” (The Eve of the Revolution, p.
54.
) 1 Section A, entitled “Who Was Offended by the Article ‘Where to Begin?*,” is omitted from the present edition, as it consists exclusively of polemics against Rabocheye Dyelo and the Bund on the alleged at­ tempts of Iskra to “command.
” etc.
Tn this section it is stated inter alia that the Bund itself in 1898-99 invited the members of Iskra to revive the central organ of the Party and organise a “literary laboratory.
”—Ed, We have emphasised the passages in this eloquent tirade which most strikingly illustrate the author’s incorrect judg­ ment of our plan, and the incorrectness of the point of view, generally, that he opposes to that of Iskra.
Unless we build up strong political organisations in the localities—even an excel­ lently organised all-Russian newspaper will be of no avail.
Ab­ solutely true.
But the whole point is that there is no other way of training strong political organisations except through the medium of an all-Russian newspaper.
The author missed the most important statement Iskra made before it proceeded to ex­ plain its “plan”: that it was necessary “to call for the estab­ lishment of a revolutionary organisation, capable of combin­ ing all the forces and of leading the movement not only in name but in deed, i.
e.
, an organisation that will be ready al any moment to support every protest and every outbreak, and to utilise these for the purpose of increasing and strengthening the military forces required for decisive battle.
” After the February and March events, everyone will agree with this in principle, con-tiuues Iskra, but wre do not need a solution of this problem in principle; what we need is a practical solution of it; we must immediately bring forward a definite plan of construction in order that everyone may set to work to build from every side.
And now we are again being dragged away from a practical solution towards something that is correct in principle, indis­ putable and great, but absolutely inadequate and absolutely incomprehensible to the broad masses of workers, namely, to “build up strong political organisations”! This is not the point that is now being discussed, most worthy author! The point is, how to train and what training it should be! It is not true to say that “we have been carrying on our work mainly among intelligent workers, wrhile the masses have been engaged almost exclusively in the economic struggle.
” Presented in such a form, this postulate goes wrong on the point which Svoboda always goes wrong on and which is radically wrong, and that is, it sets up the intelligent workers in contrast to the “masses.
” Even the intelligent workers have been “engaged al­ most exclusively in the economic struggle” during the past few years.
Moreover, the masses will never learn to conduct the political struggle until we help to train leaders for this struggle, both from among the intelligent workers and from among the intellectuals; and such leaders can be trained solely by system­ atic and every-day appreciation of all aspects of our political life, of all attempts at protest and struggle on the part of vari­ ous classes and on various grounds.
Therefore, to talk about “building up political organisations” and at the same time to contrast a “paper organisation” of a political newspaper to “live political work in the localities” is simply ridiculous! Why, Iskra has adapted its “plan” for a newspaper to the “plan” for creat­ ing a “militant preparedness” to support the unemployed move­ ment, peasant revolts, discontent among the Zemstvo-ists.
“popu­ lar indignation against the reckless tsarist bashi-bazuks,” etc.
Everyone who is at all acquainted with the movement knows per­ fectly well that the majority of local organisations never even drcam of these things, that many of the prospects of “live polit­ ical work” here indicated have never been realised by a single organisation, that the attempt to call attention to the growth of discontent and protest among the Zemstvo intelligentsia rouses feelings of consternation and amazement in Nadezhdin (“Good Lord, is this newspaper intended for the Zemstvo-ists?”— Kanun^ p.
129), among the Economists (letter to Iskra, No.
12) and among many of the practical workers.
Under these circumstances, it is possible to “begin” only by stirring up peo­ ple to think about all these things, by stirring them up to sum­ marise and generalise all the signs of ferment and active struggle.
“Live political work” can be begun in our time, when Social-Democratic tasks are being degraded, exclusively by means of live political education, which is impossible unless we have a frequently issued and properly distributed all-Russian newspaper.
Those who regard Iskra's “plan” as a manifestation of “liter­ ariness” have totally failed to understand the substance of the plan, and imagine that what is suggested as the most suitable means for the present time is the ultimate goal.
These people 1 The Eve,—Ed, En%, ed, have not taken the trouble to study the two comparisons that were drawn to illustrate the plan proposed, Iskra wrote: the publication of an all-Russian political newspaper must be the main line that must guide us in our work of unswervingly dev­ eloping, deepening and expanding this organisation (i.
e.
, a rev­ olutionary organisation always prepared to support every pro­ test and every outbreak).
Pray tell me: when a bricklayer lays bricks in various parts of an enormous structure the like of which has never been seen before, is it “paper” work to use a line to help him find the correct place to put each brick, to in­ dicate to him the ultimate goal of the work as a whole, to enable him to use not only every brick but even every piece of brick which, joining with the bricks placed before and after it, forms a complete and all-embracing line? And are wTe not now passing through a period in our Party life when we have bricks and bricklayers, but lack the guiding line which all could see and follow? Let them shout that in stretching out the line, we desire to command.
Had we desired to command, gentlemen, we would have written on the title page, not “Iskra, No, 1” but “Raboch* ay a Cazeta, No.
3,” as we were invited to do by a number of comrades, and as we had a perfect right to do.
* But we did not do that.
We wished to have our hands free to conduct an irreconcilable struggle against all pseudo-Social-Democrats; we wanted our line, if properly laid, to be respected because it was correct, and not because it was carried out by an official organ.
“The question of combining local activity in central organs runs in n vicious circle,” L.
Nadezhdin tells us pedantically, “for this requires homo­ geneous elements, and this homogeneity can be created only by some­ thing that combines; but this combining element may be the product of strong local organisations which at the present time are not distin­ guished for their homogeneity.
” This truism is as hoary and indisputable as the one that says we must build up strong political organisations.
And it is equal­ ly barren.
Every question “runs in a vicious circle” because the whole of political life is an endless chain consisting of an infinite number of links.
The whole art of politics lies in finding the link that is least likely to be torn out of our hands, the one that is most important at the given moment, the one that guarantees the command of the whole chain, and having found it, in clinging to that link as tightly as possible.
If we possessed a staff of ex­ perienced bricklayers, who had learned to work so well together that they could dispense with a guiding line and could place their bricks exactly where they were required without one (and, speaking abstractly, this is by no means impossible), then per­ haps we might seize upon some other link.
But the unfortunate thing is that we have no experienced bricklayers trained to teamwork, that bricks are often laid where they are not needed at all, that they are not laid according to the general line, and are so scattered about that the enemy can shatter the structure as if it were made not of bricks but of sand.
Here is the other comparison: “A paper is not merely a collective propagandist and collective agitator, it is also a collective organiser.
In this respect it can be com­ pared to the scaffolding erected around a building in construction; it marks the contours of the structure and facilitates communication be­ tween the builders, permitting them to distribute the work and to view the common results achieved by their organised labour.
”1 Does this sound anything like the attempt of an armchair author to exaggerate his role? The scaffolding put up around a building is not required at all for habitation, it is made of the cheapest material, it is only put up temporarily, and as soon as the shell of the structure is completed, is destroyed.
As for the building up of revolutionary organisations, experience shows that sometimes they may be built without scaffolding—take the ’seventies for example.
But at the present time we cannot imagine that the building we require can be put up without scaffolding.
Nadezhdin disagrees with this, and says: “Iskra thinks that as a matter of fact people will gather around it, and they will or­ ganise.
But they will find it more interesting to gather and organise, around something more concrete^” So! So! “They will find it more interesting to gather around something more con-1 Martynov, quoting the first sentence in this passage in Rahocheye Dy do (No.

Crete.
.
.
There is a Russian proverb which says: “Don’t spit into the well, you may want to drink out of it” But thene are people who do not object to drinking from a well which has been spat into.
What despicable things our magnificent, legal “critics of Marxism” and illegal admirers of Rabochaya My si have said in the name of this—something more concrete! See how restricted our movement is by our own narrowness, lack of initiative and hesitation, and yet this is justified by the tradi-tional argument about finding it “more interesting to gather around something more concrete:” And Nadezhdin—who regards himself as being particularly sensitive to “life,” who so severely condemns “armchair” authors, who (with pretensions to being witty) charges Iskra with a weakness for seeing Economism everywhere, and who imagines that he stands far above this dis­ crimination between the “orthodox” and the “critics”—fails to see that with this sort of argument he is playing into the hands of the very narrowness with which he is so indignant and that he is drinking from a well that has actually been spat into! The sincerest indignation against narrowness, the most passionate desire to raise those who worship this narrowness from their knees, is insufficient if the indignant one is swept along without sail or rudder as “spontaneously” as the revolutionaries of the ’seventies, and clutches at such things as “excitative terror,” “agrarian terror,” “sounding the tocsin,” etc.
Glance at this some­ thing “more concrete” around which he thinks it will be “more interesting” to gather and organise: 1) local newspapers; 2) preparations for demonstrations; 3) work among the unem­ ployed.
It will be seen at the very first glance that all these have been seized upon at random in order to be able to say some­ thing, for however we may regard them, it would be absurd to see in them anything especially adapted for the purpose of “gathering and organising.
” This very Nadezhdin a few pages further on says: “It is lime we simply slated the fact that ex­ tremely petty work is being carried on in the localities, the com­ mittees are not doing a tenth of what they could do .
.
.
the com­ bining centres that we have at the present time are a pure fiction, they represent a sort of revolutionary bureaucracy, the members of which mutually appoint each other to the post of generals; and so it will continue until strong local organisations grow up.
” These remarks, while exaggerating the position somewhat, express many a bitter truth, but cannot Nadezhdin see the connection be­ tween the petty work carried on in the localities and the narrow outlook of the Party workers, the narrow scope of their activities, which is inevitable in view of the lack of training of the Party workers isolated in their local organisations? Has he, like the author of the article on organisation published in Svoboda, for­ gotten how the adoption of a broad local press (in 1898) was accompanied by a very strong intensification of Economism and “primitive methods”? Even if a broad local press could be es­ tablished at all satisfactorily (and we have shown above that it is impossible save in very exceptional cases)—even dien the lo­ cal organs could not ‘"gather and organise” all the revolutionary forces for a general attack upon the autocracy and for the leader­ ship of a united struggle.
Do not forget that we are here dis­ cussing only the “gathering.
” the organising significance of a newspaper, and we could put to Nadezhdin, who defends diffuse­ ness, the very question that he himself has already put ironical­ ly: “Has someone left us a legacy of 200,000 revolutionary organisers?” Furthermore, “preparations for demonstrations” cannot be opposed to Iskra s plan for the very reason that this plan includes the organisation of the widest possible demonstra­ tions as one of its aims; the point under discussion is the selec­ tion of the practical means.
On this point also Nadezhdin has become confused and has lost sight of the fact that only al­ ready “gathered and organised” forces can “prepare for” demon­ strations (which hitherto, in the overwhelming majority of cases, have taken place quite spontaneously) and we lack precisely the ability to gather and organise.
“Work among the unem­ ployed.
” Again the same confusion, for this too represents one of the military operations of mobilised forces and not a plan to mobilise the forces.
The extent to which Nadezhdin underesti­ mates the harm caused by our diffuseness, by our lack of “200,000 organisers,” can be seen from the following: many (including Nadezhdin) have reproached Iskra with the paucity of the news it gives about unemployment and with the casual nature of the correspondence it publishes about the most com­ mon affairs of rural life.
The reproach is justified, but Iskra is “guilty without sin.
” We strive to “stretch a line” even through the countryside, but there are almost no bricklayers there, and we are obliged to encourage everyone to send us information concerning even the most common facts, in the hope that this will increase the number of our contributors in this field and will train us all at least to select die really most outstanding facts.
But the material on which we can train is so scanty that unless we generalise it for the whole of Russia we shall have very little to train on at all.
No doubt one who possesses at least as much capability as an agitator, and as much knowledge of the life of the vagrant as apparently Nadezhdin does, could render priceless service to the movement by carrying on agitation among the unemployed—but such a one would be simply bury­ ing his talents if he failed to inform all Russian comrades of every step he took in his work, in order that others, who, in the mass, as yet lack the ability to undertake new kinds of work, might learn from his example.
Absolutely everybody now talks about the importance of unity, about the necessity for “gathering and organising,” but the ma­ jority of us lack a definite idea of where to begin and how to bring about this unification.
Probably everyone will agree that if we “unite,” say, die district circles in a given city, it will be necessary to have for this purpose common institutions, i.

, not merely a common title of “League” but genuinely common work, exchange of material, experience and forces, distribution of functions, not only in the given districts but in a whole city, according to special tasks.
Everyone will agree that a big secret apparatus will not pay its way (if one may employ a commercial expression) “with the resources” (in material and man power, of course) of a single district, and that a single district will not provide sufficient scope for a spe­ cialist to develop his talents.
But the same tiling applies to the unification of a number of cities, because even such a field, like a single locality, will prove, and has already proved in the his­ 12 Lenin ll tory of our Social-Democratic movement, to be too restricted: we have already proved this above, in connection with political agi­ tation and organisational work.
We must first and foremost widen the field, establish real contacts between the cities on the basis of regular, common work; for diffuseness restricts the activities of our people who are “stuck in a hole” (to use the expression employed by a correspondent to Iskra), not knowing what is hap­ pening in the world; they have no one to learn from, do not know how to obtain or to satisfy their desire to engage in broad activities.
And I continue to insist that we can start establish­ ing real contacts only with the aid of a common newspaper, as a single, regular, all-Russian enterprise, which will sum­ marise the results of all the diverse forms of activity and there­ by stimulate our people to march forward untiringly along all the innumerable paths which lead to revolution in the same way as all roads lead to Rome.
If w*e do not want unity in name only, we must arrange for every local circle immediately to assign, say, a fourth of its forces to active work for the common cause, and the newspaper will immediately convey to them the general design, dimensions and character of this cause, will indicate to them precisely the most serious defects of all­ Russian activity, where agitation is lacking and where contacts are weak, and point out which small wheel in the great general mechanism could be repaired or replaced by a better one.
A circle that has not yet commenced to work, which is only just seeking work, could then start, not like a craftsman in a small separate workshop unaware of the development that has taken place in “industry” before him, or of the methods of production prevailing in industry, but as a participant in an extensive en­ terprise that reflects the whole general revolutionary attack up­ on the autocracy.
And the more perfect the finish of each little wheel, the larger the number of detail workers working for the common cause, the closer will our network become and the less consternation will inevitable police raids call forth in the gen­ eral ranks.
The mere function of distributing a newspaper will help to establish real contacts (that is, if it is a newspaper worthy of the name, i.
e.
, if it is issued regularly, not once a month like a magazine, but four times a month).
At the present time, communication between cities on revolutionary business is an extreme rarity, and at all events the exception rather than the rule.
If we had a newspaper, however, such communication would become the rule and would secure, not only the distribu­ tion of the newspaper, of course, but also (and what is more important) an interchange of experience, of material, of forces and of resources.
The scope of organisational work would im­ mediately become ever so much wider and the success of a single locality would serve as a standing encouragement to further perfection and a desire to utilise the experience gained by com­ rades working in other parts of the country.
Local work would become far richer and more varied than it is now: political and economic exposures gathered from all over Russia would pro­ vide mental food for the workers of all trades and in all stages of development, would provide material and occasion for talks and readings on the most diverse subjects, which indeed will be suggested by hints in the legal press, by conversations in society and by “shamefaced” government communications.
Every outbreak, every demonstration, would be weighed and dis­ cussed in all its aspects all over Russia; it would stimulate a desire to catch up with the rest, a desire to excel (we Social­ ists do not by any means reject all rivalry or all “competi­ tion”!) and consciously to prepare for that which at first ap­ peared to spring up spontaneously, a desire to take advantage of the favourable conditions in a given district or at a given moment for modifying the plan of attack, etc.
At the same time, this revival of local work would render superfluous that des­ perate, “convulsive” exertion of all efforts and the risking of all men which every single demonstration or the publication of every single number of a local newspaper now entails.
In the first place the police would find it much more difficult to dig down to the “roots” because they would not know in what dis­ trict to seek for them.
Secondly, regular common work would train our people to regulate the force of a given attack in ac­ cordance with the strength of the forces of the given local detach-ment of the army (at the present time no one ever thinks of doing that, because in nine cases out of ten these attacks occur spontaneously), and would facilitate the “transport” from one place to another, not only of literature, but also of revolution­ ary forces.
In a great many cases, these forces at the present time shed their blood in the cause of restricted local work, but under the circumstances we are discussing, occasion would constantly arise for transferring a capable agitator or organiser from one end of the country to the other.
Beginning with short journeys on Party business at the Party’s expense, our people would become accustomed to being maintained by the Party, would become professional revolutionaries and would train themselves to be­ come real political leaders.
And if indeed we succeeded in reaching a point when all, or at least a considerable majority, of the local committees, local groups and circles actively took up work for the common cause we could, in the not distant future, establish a daily newspaper that would be regularly distributed in tens of thou­ sands of copies over the whole of Russia.
This newspaper would become a part of an enormous pair of smith’s bellows that would blow every spark of class struggle and popular indigna­ tion into a general conflagration.
Around what is in itself a very innocent and very small, but a regular and common cause, in the full sense of the word, an army of tried warriors would systematically gather and receive their training.
On the ladders and scaffolding of this general organisational structure there would soon ascend Social-Democratic Zhelyabovs from among our revolutionaries and Russian Bebels from among our work­ ers who would take their place at the head of the mobilised army and rouse the whole people to settle accounts with the shame and the curse of Russia.
That is what we ought to be dreaming about! * ♦ ♦ “We ought to he dreaming!” I wrote these words and became alarmed.
It seemed to me that I was sitting at a “unity congress” and that opposite me were the editors and contributors of Ra-bocheye Dyelo.
Comrade Martynov rises and, turning to me, says threateningly: “Permit me to enquire, has an autonomous editorial board the right to dream without first obtaining per­ mission of the Party committee?” He is followed by Comrade Krichevsky who (philosophically deepening Comrade Martynov who had long ago deepened Comrade Plekhanov) continues in the same strain even more threateningly: “I go further.
I ask, has a Marxist any right at all to dream, knowing that according to Marx man always sets himself achievable tasks and that tactics is a process of growth of tasks, which grow together with the Party?” The very thought of these menacing questions sends a cold shiver down my back and makes me wash for nothing but a place to conceal myself in.
I shall try to conceal myself behind* the back of Pisarev.
1 “There are differences and differences,” wrote Pisarev concerning the question of the difference between dreams and reality.
“My dream may run ahead of the natural progress of events or may fly off at a tangent in a direction in which no natural progress of events will ever proceed.
In the first case the dream will not cause any harm; it may even sup­ port and strengthen the efforts of toiling humanity.
There is nothing in such dreams that would distort or paralyse labour power.
On the contrary, if man were completely deprived of the ability to dream in this way, if he could never run ahead and mentally conceive, in an entire and completed picture, the results of the work he is only just commenc­ ing, then I cannot imagine what stimulus there would be to induce man to undertake and complete extensive and fatiguing work in the sphere of art, science and practical work.
.
.
.
Divergence between dreams and reality causes no harm if only the person dreaming believes seriously in his dream, if he attentively observes life, compares his observations with the airy castles he builds and if, generally speaking, he works con­ scientiously for the achievement of his phantasies.
If there is some con­ nection between dreams and life then all is well.
” Now of this kind of dreaming there is unfortunately too little in our movement.
And those most responsible for this are the ones who boast of their sober views, their “closeness” to the “concrete,” i.
e.
, the representatives of legal criticism and of il­ legal “khvostism.

What Type of Organisation Do We Require? From what has been said the reader will understand that our “tactics-plan” consists in rejecting an immediate call for the at­ tack, in demanding “a regular siege of the enemy fortress,” or in other words, in demanding that all efforts be directed to­ wards gathering, organising and mobilising permanent troops.
When we ridiculed Rabocheyc Dyelo for its leap from FxjMiom-ism to shouting for an attack (in Listok Rabochevo Dycla, No.
6, April 1901), it of course hurled accusations against us of be­ ing “doctrinaire,” of failing ito understand our revolutionary duty, of calling for caution, etc.
Of course we were not in the least surprised to hear these accusations coming from those who totally lack principles and who evade all arguments by refer­ ences to a profound “tactics-process,” any more than we were surprised by the fact that these accusations were repeated by Nadezhdin who in general has a supreme contempt for durable programmes and the fundamentals of tactics.
It is said that history never repeats itself.
But Nadezhdin is exerting every effort to cause it to repeat itself and he zealously imitates Tkachev1 in strongly condemning “revolutionary cultur-ism,” in shouting about “sounding the tocsin,” about a special “eve of the revolution point of view,” etc.
Apparently, he has forgotten the well-known epigram which says: if an orig­ inal historical event represents a tragedy, the copy of it is only a farce.
The attempt to seize power, after the ground for the attempt had been prepared by the preaching of Tkachev and carried out by means of the “terrifying” terror which did really terrify, was majestic.
1 2 hut the “excitative” terror of a little Tkachev is simply ridiculous and is particularly ridiculous when it is supplemented by the idea of an organisation of average workers.

“If Iskra would only emerge from its sphere of literariness,“ wrote Nadezhdin, “it would realise that these [the workingman’s letter to Iskra, No.
7, etc.
] arc symptoms of the fact that soon, very soon, the ‘attack” will commence, and to talk now [sic/] about organisations linked up with an all-Russian newspaper is simply to give utterance to armchair thoughts and to do armchair work.
” What unimaginable confusion this is: on the one hand ex­ citative terror and an “organisation of average workers” accompa­ nied by the opinion that it is “more interesting” to gather around something “more concrete” like a local newspaper—and on the other hand, to talk “now” about an all-Russian organisation means giving utterance to armchair thoughts, or, to speak more frankly and simply, “now” is already too late! But what about the “extensive organisation of local newpapers”—is it not too late for that, my dear L.
Nadezhdin? And compare this with Iskras point of view and tactics: excitative terror—is nonsense; to talk about an organisation of average workers and about the extensive organisation of local newspapers means opening the door wide for Economism.
We must speak about a single all-Russian organisation of revolutionaries, and it will never be too late to talk about that until the real, and not the paper, attack commences.
“Yes, as far as our situation in regard to organisation is concerned, it is far from brilliant,” continues Nadezhdin.
“Yes, Iskra is absolutely right when it says that the mass of our military forces consists of volunteers and insurgents.
.
.
.
You do very well in thus soberly presenting the state of our forces.
But why in doing so do you forget that the crowd is not ours, and, consequently, it will not ask us when to commence military operations, it will simply go and ‘rebel? .
.
.
When the crowd itself breaks out with its elemental destructive force it may overwhelm and crush the ‘regular troops’ among whom we had been preparing all the time to introduce extremely systematic organisation, but had never managed to do so.
” (Our italics.
) Astonishing logic! Precisely because the “crowd is not ours,” it is stupid and reprehensible to call for an “attack” this very minute, because an attack must be made by regular troops and not by a spontaneous outburst of the crowd.
It is precisely be­ cause ithe crowd may overwhelm and crush the regular troops that we must without fail “manage to keep up” with the spontane­ ous rise of the masses in our work of “introducing extreme­ ly systematic organisation” among ithe regular troops, for the more we “manage” to introduce organisation the more iprob-aible will it be that the regular troops will not be over­ whelmed by the crowd, but will take their place at the head of the crowd.
Nadezhdin is confused because he imagines that these systematically organised troops are engaged in something that isolates diem from the crowd, when as a matter of fact they are engaged exclusively in all-sided and all-embracing pol­ itical agitation, i.
e.
, precisely in work that brings them, into closer proximity to, and merges the elemental destructive force of the crowd with, the conscious destructive force of the organisa­ tion of revolutionaries.
You, gentlemen, merely wish to throw the blame for your sins on the shoulders of others.
For it is pre­ cisely the Svoboda group that includes terror in its programme and by that calls for an organisation of terrorists, and such an organisation would really prevent our troops from coming into proximity to the crowd which, unfortunately, is still not ours, and which, unfortunately, does not yet ask us, or rarely asks us when and how to commence military operations.
“We will miss the revolution itself,5’ continues Nadezhdin in his effort to scare Iskra, “in the same way as we missed recent events which hurled themselves upon us like a bolt from the blue.
” This sentence together with the one quoted above clearly demonstrates die absurdity of the “eve of the revolution point of view” invented by Svoboda.
1 To speak frankly, this special “point of view” amounts to this: it is too late “now” to discuss and prepare.
If that is the case, oh most worthy opponent of “literariness,” what was the use of writing a pamphlet of 132 pages on “questions of theory and tactics”? 2 Don’t you think it 1 The Eve of the Revolution, p.
62.
2 In his Review of Questions of Theory, L.
Nadezhdin made almost no contribution whatever to the discussion of questions of theory apart per­ haps from the following passage which appears to be a very peculiar one from the “eve of the revolution point of view”: “Bernsteinism, on the whole, is losing its acuteness for us at the present moment, as also is the question as to whether Mr.
Adamovich has proved that Mr.
Struve has already deserved dismissal, or on the contrary whether Mr.
Struve will refute Mr.
Adamovich and will refuse to resign—It really makes no difference, because the hour of the revolution has struck.
” (P.
110.
) One would have been more becoming for the “eve of the revolution point of view” to have issued 132,000 leaflets containing the brief call: “Kill them!”? Those who place national political agitation at the corner­ stone of their programme, their tactics and their organisational work as Iskra does, stand die least risk of missing the revolu­ tion.
The people who were engaged over the whole of Russia in weaving a network of organisations to be linked up with an all-Russian newspaper not only did not miss the spring events but, on the contrary, they enabled us to foretell them.
Nor did they miss the demonstrations that were described in Iskra, Nos.
13 and 14; on the contrary, they took part in those demon­ strations, clearly appreciating their duty to come to the aid of the spontaneously rising crowd and, at the same time, through the medium of the newspaper, they helped all the comrades in Russia to become more closely acquainted with these demonstra­ tions and to utilise their experience.
And if they live they will not miss the revolution which first and foremost will demand of us experience in agitation, ability to support (in a Social-Demo­ cratic manner) every protest, ability to direct the spontaneous movement, and to safeguard it from the mistakes of friends and the traps of enemies! This brings us to the final argument that compels us to in­ sist particularly upon a plan of organisation that shall be cen­ tred around an all-Russian newspaper, to be brought about by means of joint work for a common newspaper.
Only such a state of organisation will secure for the Social-Democratic milit­ ant organisation the necessary flexibility, i.
e,, the ability to adapt itself immediately to the most diverse and rapidly chang­ ing conditions of struggle, the ability, “on the one hand, to can hardly imagine a more striking illustration of L.
Nadezhdin's in­ finite disregard for theory.
We have proclaimed “the eve of the revolu­ tion,” therefore, “it really makes no difference” whether the orthodox Marxists will succeed in driving the critics from their positions or not!! And our wiseacre fails to see that it is precisely in the time of revolu­ tion that we stand in need of the results of our theoretical combats with the critics in order to be able resolutely to combat their practical positions! avoid open battle against the overwhelming and concentrated forces of the enemy, and, on the other, to take advantage of the clumsiness of the enemy and attack him at a time and place he least expects attack.
” 1 It would be a grievous error indeed to build up the Party organisation in the expectation only of out­ breaks and street fighting, or only upon the “forward march of the drab every-day struggle.
” We must always carry on our every-day work and always be prepared for everything, because very frequently it is almost impossible to foresee when periods of outbreaks will give way to periods of calm.
And even in those cases when it is possible to do so, it will not be possible to utilise this foresight for the purpose of reconstruct­ ing our organisation, because in an autocratic country these changes take place with astonishing rapidity and are some­ times due merely to a single night raid by the tsarisit janizaries.
And the revolution itself must not by any means be regarded as a single act (as Nadezhdin apparently imagines) but as a series of more or less powerful outbreaks rapidly alter­ nating with more or less intense calm.
For that reason, the principal content of the activity of our Party organisation, the focus of this activity should be, to carry on work that is pos­ sible and necessary in the period of the most powerful out­ breaks as well as in the period of complete calm, that is to say, work of political agitation linked up over the whole of Russia, that will enlighten all aspects of life and will be car­ 11skra^ No.
4, “Where to Begin?” “Revolutionary culturists, who do not accept the eve of the revolution point of view, are not in the least disturbed by the prospect of working for a long period of time” writes Nadezhdin.
(P.
62.
) On this we shall observe: unless we are able to devise /political tactics and an organisational plan based precisely upon calculations for work over a long period of time and at the same time, in the very process of this workt put our Party into readiness to spring to its post and fulfil its duty at the very first, even unexpected, call, as soon as the progress of events becomes accelerated, we shall prove to be but miserable political adventurers.
Only Nadezhdin, who began to de­ scribe himself as a Social-Democrat only yesterday, can forget that the aim of Social-Democracy is radically to transform the conditions of life of the whnle of humanity and that for that reason it is not permissible for Social-Democrats to be “disturbed” by the question of the duration of the work.
ried on among the broadest possible strata of the masses.
But this work cannot possibly be carried on in contemporary Russia without an all-Russian newspaper, issued very frequently.
An organisation that springs up spontaneously around this news­ paper, an organisation of collaborators of this paper (col­ laborators in the broad sense of the word, i.
e.
, all those work­ ing for it) will be ready for everything, from protecting the honour, the prestige and continuity of the Party in periods of acute revolutionary “depression,” to preparing for, commenc­ ing and carrying out the national armed insurrection.
Indeed, picture to yourselves a very ordinary occurrence with us—the complete discovery and arrest of our organisation in one or several localities.
In view of the fact that all the local organisations lack a single, common regular task, such raids frequently result in the interruption of our work for many months.
If, however, all the local organisations had one com­ mon task, then, in the event of a serious raid, two or three energetic persons could in the course of a few weeks establish new youth circles, which, as is well known, spring up very quickly even now, and link them up with the centre, and when this common task, which has been interrupted by the raid, is apparent to all, the new circles could spring up and link them­ selves up with it even more rapidly.
On the other hand, picture to yourselves a popular uprising.
Probably everyone will now agree that we must think of this uprising and prepare for it.
But how to prepare for it? Surely the Central Committee cannot appoint agents to go to all the districts for the purpose of preparing for the uprising! Even if we had a Central Committee it could achieve nothing by making such appointments, considering the conditions prevailing in contemporary Russia.
But a network of agents that would automatically be created in the course of establishing and distributing a common newspaper would not have to “sit around and wait” for the call to rebellion, but would carry on the regular work that would guarantee the highest prob­ ability of success in the event of a rebellion.
Such work would strengthen our contacts with the broadest strata of the masses of the workers and with all those strata who are dis­ contented with the autocracy, which is so important in the event of an uprising.
It is precisely such work that would help to cultivate the ability properly to estimate the general political situation and, consequently, the ability to select the proper moment for the uprising.
It is precisely such work that would train all local organisations to respond simultaneously to the same political questions, incidents and events that excite the whole of Russia, to react to these “events” in the most vigorous, uniform and expedient manner possible; for is not rebellion in essence the most vigorous, most uniform and most expedient “reaction” of the whole of the people to the conduct of the gov­ ernment? And finally, such work would train all revolutionary organisations all over Russia to-maintain the most continuous, and at »the same time the most secret, contact with each other, which would create real Party unity—for without such contacts it will be impossible collectively to discuss the plan of rebel­ lion and to take the necessary preparatory measures on the eve of it, which must be kept in the strictest secrecy.
In a word, the “plan for an all-Russian political newspaper” does not represent the fruits of the work of armchair workers, infected with dogmatism and literariness (as it seemed to those who failed to study it properly), on the contrary, it is a practical plan to begin immediately to prepare on all sides for the uprising, while at the same time never for a moment forgetting the ordinary, every-day work.
CONCLUSION The history of Russian Social-Democracy can be divided into three distinct periods: The first period covers about ten years, approximately the years 1884 to 1894.
This was the period of the rise and con­ solidation of the theory and programme of Social-Democracy.
The number of adherents of the new tendency in Russia could be counted in units.
Social-Democracy existed without a labour movement; it was, as it were, in its period of gestation.
The second period covers three or four years—1894-98.
In this period Social-Democracy’ appeared in the world as a social movement, as the rising of the masses of the people, as a polit­ ical party.
This is the period of its childhood and adolescence.
The fight against Narodism and going among the workers in­ fected the intelligentsia wholesale like an epidemic, and the workers were equally infected by strikes.
The movement made enormous strides.
The majority of the leaders were very young people who had by no means reached the “age of thirty-five” which to N.
Mikhailovsky appears to be a sort of natural borderline.
Owing to their youth, they proved to be untrained for practical work and they left the scene with aston­ ishing rapidity.
But in the majority of cases -the scope of their work was extremely wide.
Many of them began their revolu­ tionary thinking as Narodovolists.
Nearly all of them in theiir early youth enthusiastically worshipped the terrorist heroes.
It was a great w:rench to abandon the captivating impressions of these heroic traditions and it was accompanied by the breaking off of personal relationships with people who were determined to remain loyal to Narodnaya Volya and for whom the young Social-Democrats had profound respect.
The struggle compelled 189 them to educate themselves, to read the illegal literature of all tendencies and to study closely the questions of legal Narodism.
Trained in this struggle, Social-Democrats went into the labour movement without “for a moment” forgetting the theories of Marxism which illumined their path or the task of overthrow­ ing the autocracy.
The formation of the Party in the spring of 18981 was the most striking and at the same time the last act of the Social-Democrats in this period.
The third period, as we have seen, began in 1897 and defi­ nitely replaced the second period in 1898 (1898—?).
This was the period of dispersion, dissolution and vacillation.
In the period of adolescence the youth’s voice breaks.
And so, in this period, die voice of Russian Social-Democracy began to break, began to strike a false note—on the one hand, in the produc­ tions of Messrs.
Struve and Prokopovich, Bulgakov and Ber­ dyaev, on the other hand, in the productions of V.
I-----n and R.
M.
, B.
Krichevsky and Martynov.
But it was only the leaders who wandered about separately and went back; the movement it­ self continued to grow, and it advanced with enormous strides.
The proletarian struggle spread to new strata of the workers over the whole of Russia and at the same time indirectly stim­ ulated the revival of the democratic spirit among the students and among other strata of the population.
The consciousness of the leaders, however, yielded to the breadth and power of the spontaneous rising; among Social-Democrats, a different streak predominated—a streak of Party workers who had been trained almost exclusively on “legal Marxian” literature, and the more the spontaneity of the masses called for consciousness, the more the inadequacy of this literature was felt.
The leaders not only lagged behind in regard to theory (“freedom of criticism”) and practice (“primitiveness”), but even tried to justify their backwardness by all sorts of high-flown arguments.
Social-Democracy was degraded to the level of trade unionism in legal literature by the Brentano-ists and in illegal literature by the khvostists.
The programme of the Credo began to be put into 1 The First Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party was held in March of that year.

operation, especially when the “primitiveness” of the Social-Democrats caused a revival of non-Social-Democratic revolution­ ary tendencies.
And if the reader reproaches me for having dealt in exces­ sive detail with a certain Rabocheye Dyelo, I shall say to him in reply: Rabocheye Dyelo acquired “historical” significance because it most strikingly reflected the “spirit” of this third period.
1 It was not the consistent R.
M.
but the weathercock Krichevskys and Martynovs who could properly express the con­ fusion and vacillation, and the readiness to make concessions to “criticism,” to “Economism” and to terrorism.
It is not the lofty contempt for practical work displayed by the worshippers of the “absolute” that is characteristic of this period, but the com­ bination of pettifogging practice and utter disregard for theory.
It was not so much the downright rejection of “grand phrases” that the heroes of this period engaged in as in the vulgarisation of these phrases: scientific socialism ceased to be an integral revolutionary theory and became a hodge-podge idea “freely” diluted with the contents of every new German textbook that ap­ peared; the slogan “class struggle” did not impel them forward to wider and more strenuous activity but served as a soothing syrup, because the “economic struggle is inseparably linked up with the political struggle”; the idea of a party did not serve as a call for the creation of a militant organisation of revolution­ aries, but was used to justify some sort of a “revolutionary bu­ reaucracy” and infantile playing at “democratic” forms.
When this third period will come to an end and the fourth begin we do not know (at all events it is already heralded by many signs).
We are passing from the sphere of history to the sphere of the present and partly to the sphere of the future.
But we firmly believe that the fourth period will see the 11 could also reply with the German proverb: Den Sack schlagt man, den Esel meint man (you beat the sack, but the blows are intended for the ass).
It was not Rabocheye Dyelo alone that was carried away by the fashion of “criticism** but also the masses of practical workers and theoreticians; they became confused on the question of spontaneity and strayed from the Social-Democratic to the trade union conception of our political and organisational tasks.
consolidation of militant Marxism, that Russian Social-Demo­ cracy will emerge from the crisis in the full strength of man­ hood, that the place of the rearguard of opportunists will be taken by a genuine vanguard of the most revolutionary class.
In the sense of calling for such a “new guard” and sum­ ming up, as it were, all that has been expounded above, my reply to the question: “What is to be done?” can be put briefly: Liquidate the Third Period.
1901-02.
WHY THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS MUST DECLARE DETERMINED AND RELENTLESS WAR ON THE SOCIALIST-REVOLUTIONARIES * 1) Because that trend of political thought in Russia which goes by the name “Socialist-Revolutionary” has actually been moving away from the only international theory of revolutionary socialism there is today, i.
e,, from Marxism.
In the great split of international Social-Democracy into an opportunist (“Bern­ stein ian”) and a revolutionary wing, this tendency has taken up a very indefinite and inadmissible half-way position between two stools; basing itself on nothing but the bourgeois and opportun­ ist criticisms of Marxism, it has pronounced the latter to have been “shaken” (Vestnik Russkoy Revolyutsii,1 No.
2, p.
62) ; it has promised to “revise” Marxism in its own way, but it has failed to do anything whatever to fulfil this threatening promise.
2) Because the Socialist-Revolutionaries helplessly yield to that dominant tendency in Russian social and political thought, which should be defined as liberal Narodism.
Repeating the error of Narodnaya Volya and of old Russian socialism in gen­ eral, the Socialist-Revolutionaries fail to see the absolute flab­ biness and the internal contradictions of this tendency; their only independent contribution in the domain of Russian revo­ lutionary thought has been to tack on a revolutionary phrase to the old testament of liberal Narodnik wisdom.
Russian Marxism was die first to undermine the theoretical foundations of liberal Narodism, to lay bare its bourgeois and petty-bourgeois class content and to declare and wage war against it undeterred by the desertion of a whole swarm of critical (opportunist) Marx­ ists to the enemy camp.
But the position which the Socialist-Revolutionaries have been occupying in this war is (at best) one 1 Messenger of the Russian Revolution.

13 Lenin II 193 of hostile neutrality, for here again they have seated llietn&elves between two stools, between Russian Marxism (from which they have only borrowed some miserable shreds I and the quasi“ socialist liberal Narodism.
3) Because, as has been pointed out, completely lacking principles in questions of international and Russian socialism, the Socialist-Revolutionaries neither understand nor recognise the only really revolutionary principle, viz.
, the class struggle.
They do not understand that in the Russia of today only that party can be really revolutionary and truly socialist which fuses sodialiism with the Russian working class movement that is being generated with increasing force and on an increasing scale by the growth of Russian capitalism.
The attitude of the Socialist-Revolutionaries towards the Russian working class movement has always been that of spectators and dilettantes, and when, for instance (as a consequence of its amazingly rapid growth), that movement fell ill with Economism.
the So­ cialist-Revolutionaries exulted over the mistakes of people who were working at the new and difficult task of rousing the masses of the workers; and when the revolutionary Marxists started and victoriously carried through the fight against this Economism, the Socialist-Revolutionaries only put spokes in their wheel.
The inevitable result of their lukewarm altitude to the work­ ing class movement is that in practice they stand aloof from it.
wdth the result that the Soda list-Re volution ary Parly lacks a social basis.
It does not rely upon any social class, for the term class cannot be applied to the group of shifting intelli­ gentsia which calls its vagueness and lack of .
principles “broad­ ness.
” 4) Because the Socialist-Revolutionary Party assumes a dis­ dainful attitude towards socialist ideology and wants to take its stand simultaneously and in an equal measure on the intel­ ligentsia, on the proletariat and on the peasantry.
and therefore inevitably (whether it wants to or not) opens the way for th^ political and intellectual enslavement of the Russian proletariat to Russian bourgeois democracy.
A disdainful attitude towards theory, an evasive and wriggling attitude towards socialist ideo­ logy, inevitably plays into the hands of bourgeois ideology.
The Russian intelligentsia and the Russian peasantry, as social strata that can be juxtaposed to the proletariat, can only be the sup­ port of a bourgeois-democratic movement.
This is not only an argument that follows imperatively from our teachings as a whole (which regard the small producer, for instance, as revo­ lutionary only to the extent that lie breaks off all connection with commodity economy and capitalism and embraces the point of view of the proletariat)—no, it is also an obvious fact, which is already beginning to make itself felt.
At die moment of the political revolution and on tire morrow of tlie revolution this fact will make itself felt with still greater force.
Socialist-Revolutionarism is one of the manifestations of petty-bourgeois instability of ideas with which.
Social-Democracy must and will always wage determined war.
5) Because all the practical demands of the programme which the Socialist-Revolutionaries have.
I won’t «ay advanced, but only outlined, have abundantly revealed the enormous harm which the absence of principles in their movement has caused.
For example, their agrarian minimum programme sketched in No.
8 of Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya (perhaps it would be more correct to say: scattered among the hackneyed premises of our Narod-ism) misleads the peasantry by promising them socialisation of land as a “minimum” and misleads the working class by giving it an entirely wrong impression of the real character of the peasant movement.
Such frivolous promises only compromise a revolutionary party in general, and in particular they com­ promise the doctrine of scientific socialism concerning the so­ cialisation of all means of production as our final object.
Sec­ ondly, by including in their minimum programme the support and development of co-operation, the Socialist-Revolutionaries abandon the ground of the revolutionary struggle and degrade their would-be socialism to the level of the most banal petty-bourgeois reformism.
Thirdly, die Socialist-Revolutionaries op­ pose the demand of the Social-Democrats for the abolition of all the mediaeval fetters that bind our village community, keep the peasant attached to his holding, deprive him of the freedom of 13* movement and inevitably determine the legal inferiority of his civil status; and by doing so they have shown that they have not been able even to safeguard themselves from the reactionary doctrines of Russian Narodism.
6) Because the Socialist-Revolutionaries have included ter­ rorism in their programme, preaching it in its modem form as a method of political struggle, and have thus done (the most) serious harm to the movement by destroying the indissoluble connection between socialist work and the mass of the revolu­ tionary class.
No verbal assurances or invocations can disprove the unquestionable fact that modem terrorism as it is practised and preached by the Socialist-Revolutionaries is not in any way linked with work among the masses, for the masses and together with the masses; that the organisation of terroristic acts by the Party distracts the very scanty organisational forces we have from their difficult and by no means completed task of organising a revolutionary workers' party; that in practice the terrorism of the Socialist-Revolutionaries is nothing more than fighting in single combat, the sort of fighting that has been wholly condemned by the experience of history.
Even foreign Socialists are beginning to be troubled by the noisy preaching of terrorism carried on today by our Socialist-Revolutionaries.
Among the masses of the Russian workers their preaching simply serves to sow harmful illusions, such as the idea that terrorism “compels people to think politically even against their will” (Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya, No.
7, p.
4), or that it “is capable of changing the opinions of thousands of people about revolution­ aries and the meaning [!!] of their activity better than months of oral propaganda,” or that it is capable of “infusing new strength into those who vacillate, who have lost courage, whs have been painfully struck by the sad outcome of many dem­ onstrations” (ibid.
), and so on.
These harmful illusions can only result in early disappointment and slacken the work of preparing for the mass attack upon the autocracy.

VULGAR SOCIALISM AND NARODISM REVIVED BY THE SOCIALIST-REVOLUTIONARIES Ridicule has a good effect.
In a series of articles entitled ‘‘Rev­ olutionary Adventurism,” we expressed the firm conviction that our Socialist-Revolutionaries would never agree to state their theoretical position in unambiguous and precise terms.
To re­ fute so malignant and unjust a suggestion Revolyirtsionnaya Rostiya in No.
11 starts a series of articles under the title “Ques­ tions of Programme.
” God speed them! Better late than never.
We welcome beforehand all the articles of Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya on “programme questions” and we promise to watch very attentively to see whether it will actually be possible to extract any programme from them.
For this purpose, let us look a little more closely into the first article, “The Class Struggle in the Village,” but let us first make the remark that when our opponents say (No.
11, p.
6) “our programme has been stated,” they are once more being unduly .
.
.
“carried away.
” You know very well, my dear sirs, that this is not true.
You have not yet stated any programme, in other words, you have not only failed to pro­ duce a complete exposition of your views officially endorsed by the Party (a programme in the strict sense of the word, or at any rate a draft programme), you have not even defined your attitude towards such fundamental “programme questions” as the question of Marxism and of its opportunist criticism, or the question of Russian capitalism, and of the position, significance and tasks of the proletariat which is generated by capital­ ism, and so on.
All we know of your programme is that you oc­ cupy an altogether indefinite position between revolutionary So-dal-Democracy and the opportunist tendency on the one hand, and between Russian Marxism and Russian liberal Narodism on the other.
197 VJe shall proceed to show, taking the issue you have chosen, the sort of insoluble contradictions you get entangled in, as a result of trying to sit between two stools.
“It is not that we are unable to understand that the peasantry of today as a whole belongs to the petty-bourgeois strata, we simply deny this,” writes Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya.
(No.
11.
) “We regard the peas­ antry as being sharply divided into two fundamentally different categories: 1) the toiling peasantry which lives by the exploita­ tion of its own labopr power [!??] and 2) the rural bour­ geoisie—middle and small—which to a greater or lesser extent lives by the exploitation of the labour power of others.
” The Socialist-Revolutionary theoreticians, who consider the “source of income’’ (utilising the unpaid labour of others) as the “es­ sential distinguishing feature” of die bourgeois class, discover “an enormous fundamental similarity” between the rural pro­ letariat and the “independent farmers” who live by applying their own labour to the means of production.
“The basis of the existence of both groups is labour, as a definite category of political economy.
This is one point.
Another is that under present conditions bodi are mercilessly exploited.
Consequently, they must be put into a single category, that of the toiling peas­ antry.
” We have delilberately presented the arguments of Revolyulsi-onnaya Rossiya in such detail in order to enable the reader to ponder over them and to appreciate their theoretical premises.
That these are unsatisfactory is obvious.
To look for the fun­ damental distinguishing feature of various classes in society in their source of income is to give precedence to relations of dis­ tribution, which in reality are only a consequence of relations of production.
This error was long ago pointed out by Marx, who described those who were unable to see it as vulgar Social­ ists.
The fundamental feature that distinguishes classes is the place they occupy in social production, and, consequently, the relation in which they stand to the means of production.
The appropriation of a part of the social means of production and their application to private enterprise, enterprises organised for the sale of the product, is the fundamental feature that distin-guislies one class in modern society (the bourgeoisie) from die proletariat, which is deprived of all means of production and sells its labour power.
To proceed: "The basis of the existence of both groups is labour, as a definite category of political economy.
” It is not labour that is a definite category of political economy, but the social form of labour, the social organisation of labour, or in other words, the mutual relations of people arising out of the part they play in social labour.
The same mistake of vulgar socialism which we have analysed is repeated here in another form.
When the Socialist-Revolutionaries say: “Essentially— the relations between farmer and farmhand, on the one hand, and between independent peasants and the money lenders, the kulaks, on the other, are exactly the same,” they reproduce whole­ sale the mistake of German vulgar socialism, which, in the per­ son.
for example, of Miihlberger, stated that essentially the relation of employer to worker is the same as that of landlord to tenant.
Our own Muhlbergers are equally incapable of dis­ tinguishing between the basic and the derivative forms of ex­ ploitation, and only declaim on the subject of “explodtation” in general.
Our Muhlbergers are equally incapable of under­ standing that it is precisely the exploitation of wage-labour that forms the basis of the whole robber order of today, that it is wage-labour that leads to the division of society into irreconcil­ ably hostile classes, and that it is only' from the point of view' of this class struggle that all the other manifestations of ex­ ploitation may be consistently gauged, without becoming vague and devoid of principle.
Russian Socialists who attach any value to the integrity of their movement and the “good name” of their revolutionary banner must give our Muhlbergers a rebuff as merciless as was given the German Miihlberger.
To give a clearer idea of howT muddle-headed the “theory” of our Socialist-Revolutionaries is.
we shall approach the same question from the practical side and try to illustrate it by con­ crete examples.
In the first place, everywhere and always the great majority of the petty bourgeoisie toils and is exploited.
Otherwise why should it be included in the transitional and intermediate strata? In the second place, in a commodity producing society small tradesmen and artisans toil and are exploited in exactly the same way as the peasants.
Are our Socialist-Revolutionaries going to create a ‘’category” of “toil­ ers” in trade and industry to replace the “narrow” category of the proletariat? Thirdly, in order that the Socialist-Revolutionaries may appreciate the importance of the “dogma” they dislike so much, let them try to visualise a suburban peasant who, with­ out employing any labourers, lives by his own labour and by the sale of agricultural produce.
May we not hope that even the most ardent Narodniki will not dare deny that this sort of peasant belongs to the petty bourgeoisie and that it is impos­ sible to “unite” him in the same class (mark you, we are talking of classes and not parties) as the wage labourers? But is there any difference in principle between the position of a suburban farmer who sells his goods and that of any small farmer in a society where commodity economy is developing? We must now ask, how are we to account for the gentlemen of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party coming so near (to put it mildly) to vulgar socialism? May it not be the accidental peculiarity of this particular writer? To refute this supposi­ tion it is sufficient to quote the following passage from No.
11 of RevolyutsioTinaya Rossiya where the writer exclaims: “As if it were all a matter of the size of one and the same economic category” (big and petty bourgeois) “and not of the difference in principle” (hear! hear!) “of two categories, viz.
, labour econ­ omy and bourgeois capitalist economy.
” It would be difficult to imagine a more complete and obvious confirmation of what we said in our article “Revolutionary Adventurism”: scratch a Socialist-Revolutionary and you will find Mr.
V.
V.
One such phrase is enough to explain the position of the Social­ ist-Revolutionaries to anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the evolution of Russian social and political thought.
We know that the basis of the pale pink quasi-socialism which used to embellish (and still embellishes) the liberal Narodism which is the prevailing creed in our educated society is the conception that peasant “labour economy” and bourgeois economy are direct opposites.
These ideas, the various shades of which have been elaborated in detail by Messrs.
Mikhailovsky.
V.
V.
, N—on and others, were one of the strongholds against which Russian Marxism directed its criticism.
If, we said, you want to help the peasant who is being ruined and oppressed, you must be able to abandon illusions and to look in the face of the reality that is destroying all the nebulous dreams about labour economy (or is it “people’s production”?) and laving bare the petty-bourgeois character of peasant economy.
In Rus­ sia, as everywhere else, small labour economy can develop and become strong only by being transformed into petty-bourgeois economy.
This transformation is actually in progress and the true and real tendency of the working peasant towards becoming a small employer has been irrefutably confirmed by facts.
To the extent that commodity production is developing, our peas­ ants, like all small producers and by the very fact of their being that, come under the category of petty bourgeois; they are be­ coming split into a minority of employers and a mass of prole­ tarians, the latter being connected with the “small owners” by a whole chain of transitional stages of semi-workers and semi­ owners (these transitional forms exist in all capitalist countries and in all branches of industry).
What then has been the attitude of the Socialist-Revolution­ aries towards the supplanting of one school of socialist thought by another, towards the struggle between early Russian social­ ism1 and Marxism? They simply tried <to evade examining the essence of the question as long as they could.
And when this was no longer possible, when these people who wanted to form a separate “party” were asked to explain themselves clearly, when they were forced to give an answer, forced by derision and by a direct charge of lack of principle, they did nothing but repeat the old Narodnik theory of “labour economy” and the old errors of vulgar socialism.
We repeat: we could not have wished for better confirmation of the charge we brought against the Socialist-Revolutionaries, viz.
, of utterly lacking principles.

—Ed, than this (article in No« 11 which attempts to “unite” the theory of “labour economy” with the theory -of the class struggle.
«-* « As a curiosity, we will add that in No.
11 of Revolyuision* naya Rossiya attempts are made io give a “becoming” explana­ tion of their decision to evade all polemics on matters of prin­ ciple.
We are told that in its article ‘‘Revolutionary Adventur­ ism.
” Iskra misquotes.
For example? For example, it omits the words “in certain places” (in certain places land passes from capital to labour).
How dreadful! An irrelevant phrase has been omitted.
Or, perhaps, Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya will dare assert that the words “in certain places” have even the slightest rela­ tion to the question of appraising the process of the land chang­ ing hands in general (whethef or not it is a bourgeois process) ? Let it try.
Further.
Iskra stopped the quotation at the words “by the state,” although this is followed by “of course, not the present state.
” Iskra, we will add, was even more cruel; it had the im­ pudence to describe the state as a class slate.
Will our opponents who “have been dreadfully hurt” assert that the stale of which the “minimum programme” speaks is not a class state? Finally, Iskra quoted the Manifesto of April 16 (3) in which, even in the opinion of Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya itself, the import­ ance of terrorism was exaggerated.
Yes, we did quote the re­ servation made by Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya, but we added that we thought all this was mere “tight-rope walking” and dark hints.
Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya was greatly displeased by this, and has set out to explain and to quote details (thus confirming, in practice, that ithere was obscurity which demanded elucidation).
What arc its explanations like? At the demand of the Party, you see, amendments were made in the Manifesto of April 16 (3).
The amendments, however, “were recognised to be in­ adequate,” and for that reason the words “in the name of the Party” were deleted from the Manifesto.
But the words “pub­ lished by the Parly” remained, and the second (’’the real”) manifesto, which was brought out on the same dale.
April 16 (3), says not a word about any dissensions or exaggeration.
After giving these explanations and realising that they only con* firm the legitimacy of Iskras demand for an explanation (in the words “tight-rope walking and hints’'), Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya itself asks the question: how could the Party have printed in its own press a manifesto it was not in agreement with? The answer given by Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya is as follows: “Why, in exactly the same way as Rabocheye Dyelo, Iskra, Rabochaya Mysl and Horba all appear with the imprint of the R.
S.
D.
LJP.
” Good.
But, in the first place, these very divergent .
publications are not printed at the “Parity” printing office, but at the printing offices of the various groups.
In the second place, when Rabochaya Mysl, Ra­ bocheye Dyelo and Iskra all appeared at the same time we de­ nounced this as confusion.
See what follows: the Social-Demo­ crats themselves lay bare and scourge confusion in their oun ranks and try to get rid of it by serious theoretical work: the Socialist-Revolutionaries only begin to admit that there is confu­ sion in their ranks after they have been exposed, and take the opportunity once again to boast of their breadth of view which permits them to issue, on the same day and on the occasion of the same political event, two manifestoes in which two diamet­ rically opposite interpretations of the political significance of this event (a new’ terroristic act) are given.
Knowing as they do that no good can come of ideological confusion, the Social-Dem­ ocrats preferred to “first divide and then unite” in order to guarantee durability and fruitfulness to the future unity.
The Socialist-Revolutionaries go on interpreting their programme in different ways, each at his own sweet will,1 but at the same time they maintain the fiction of “practical” unity and superciliously say to us: it is only among you Social-Democrats that various 1 You have only to compare Our Tusks, published by the former “League of Socialist-Revolutionaries.

THE PERSECUTORS OF THE ZEMSTVO AND THE HANNIBALS OF LIBERALISM * V1 Mr.
R.
N.
S.
’s2 preface represents much that is of interest It touches upon the broadest questions concerning political re­ forms in Russia, the various methods by which these reforms can be brought about and the significance of the various forces leading to these reforms.
On the other hand, Mr.
R.
N.
S.
who apparently has close relations with libera! circles generally, and with Zemstvo liberal circles in particular, undoubtedly sounds a new chord in the chorus of our “underground” literature.
There­ fore, in order to clear up the question of the political significance of the Zemstvos in principle, and in order that we may become acquainted with the currents and, I shall not say tenden­ cies, but the moods prevailing in circles that stand close to the liberals, it will be useful to deal in detail with this preface, and to endeavour to decide whether what is new in it is good or bad, or how much of it is good and how much bad.
The fundamental feature of R.
N.
S.
’s views is the following: as is apparent from numerous passages of his essay, which we quote below, he is in favour of peaceful, gradual and strictly legal development.
On the other hand, he is wholeheartedly opposed to the autocracy and thirsts for political liberty.
But the autocracy is what it is precisely because it prohibits and persecutes all “development” towards liberty.
This contradic­ tion permeates the whole of R.
N.
S.
’s essay and renders his argumentation extremely illogical hesitating and unsound.
It is possible to combine constitutionalism with a regard for the 1 Only chapters V and VI of this pamphlet are given in thia volume.

[Author’s note to 1908 edition.

] 205 strictly legal development of autocratic Russia only on die prem­ ise, or at least the assumption, that the autocratic government will itself understand, grow weary, yield, etc.
And Mr.
R.
N.
S.
does indeed sometimes fall from the height of his civic indig­ nation to the vulgar point of view of the most immature liberal­ ism.
For example, this is what Mr.
R.
N.
S.
says of himself: “Wo who regard the struggle for political liberty as a vow of Hannibal taken by contemporary enlightened people that is no less sacred than the struggle for the emancipation of the peasants was for the people of the ’forties.
.
.
and again “.
.
.
however trying it is to us who have taken the ‘vow of Hannibal' to fight against the autocracy," etc.
Well said! These powerful words would have been an orna­ ment to the article, had this spirit of indomitable and irrecon­ cilable struggle (“the vow of Hannibal”!) pervaded the whole of it.
But precisely because these words are so powerful they strike a discordant note when accompanied by the strains of artificial conciliation and pacification, by attempts, however forced, to introduce the conception of peaceful, strictly legal development.
Unfortunately, more than enough of such notes and such attempts arc observed in R.
N.
S.
’s article.
For ex­ ample, he devotes a page and a half to a detailed “argumenta­ tion” of the idea that ‘ the policy of <thc state during the reign of Nicholas II deserves even sterner [our italics] condemna­ tion from the moral and political point of view7 than the reac­ tionary revision of the reforms of Alexander II, carried out in the reign of Alexander III.
” * Why sterner condemnation? It ap­ pears that because Alexander III fought against revolution, while Nicholas II fought against “the legal aspirations of Rus­ sian society,” the former fought against politically conscious forces, while the latter fought against—“quite peaceful, social forces, often acting without ainy clear political ideas” (“hardly even realising that their conscious cultural work was undermin­ ing the state system”).
To a considerable degree this is untrue in point of fact, as we shall show further on.
But apart from this, one cannot help noting the author’s peculiar process of reasoning.
He condemns autocracy, but condemns one autocrat more than another, not because of policy, for that has remained unchanged, but because he has not (as he alleges) to contend against “termagants” who “naturally” call forth sharp resist­ ance, and, consequently, he has no justification for his acts of persecution.
Is not the very use of such an argument an obvious concession to the loyal and humble argument that our little father, the tsar, need not fear to call together his beloved people because all these beloved people have never dreamed of anything beyond the limits of peaceful strivings and strict legality? We are not surprised wlien Mr.
Witte displays such a “process of reasoning” (or process of lying), when in his Memorandum, he writes: ’’One would suppose that when there are no political parties and no revolution, and when the rights of the supreme authority are not being challenged, no contrast should he drawn between the administration and the people or society,1 etc.
” We are not surprised to encounter such arguments in the writ­ ings of Mr.
Chicherin, who, in the memorandum he sub­ mitted to Count Milyutin after March 13 (1), 1881,2 declared that: “The authorities must first of all display their energy and show that they have not lowered the flag in the face of danger,” that “the monarchical system is compatible with free institu­ tions only when the latter are the fruit of peaceful develop­ ment and the calm initiative of the .
supreme authority itself,” and recommended the establishment of a “strong and liberal” government operating with the aid of a “legislative organ strengthened and renovated by the elective element.
” 3 It is nat­ ural that this Mr.
Chicherin should regard the policy of Nich­ olas II as worthy of greater condemnation, because in his reign peaceful development and the calm initiative of the supreme authority itself might have led to free institutions.
But is it natural and decent to hear such reasoning from a man who took the vow of Hannibal to fight? 1 P.

Mr.
R.
N.
S.
is wrong in point of fact.
“Now,” be says, com­ paring die present reign with the previous one, “no one thinks seriously of the violent revolution advocated by the adherents of Narodnaya Volya.
” Parlez pour vous, Monsieur! Speak only for yourself.
We know quite definitely that die revolutionary movement in Russia in die present reign has not only not died out, or subsided in comparison with the movement in the pre­ vious reign, but that on the contrary it has revived and grown manifoldly.
What sort of “revolutionary” movement would it be if no one taking part in it -thought seriously of a violent rev­ olution? It may be objected that in die lines quoted, Mr.
R.
N.
S.
has in mind not violent revolution in general, but a specific, Narodovolist revolution, i.
e.
, a revolution that will be at one and the same time a political and a social revolu­ tion, leading not only to the overthrow of the autocracy, but also to the seizure of power.
Such an objeotion, however, would be unsound.
First, because from die point of view of the autocracy as such (i.
e.
, of die autocratic government and not of the “bourgeoisie” or “society”), it is not the purpose for which its overthrow is aimed at that matters, but the very fact that its overthrow is aimed at.
Secondly, adherents of Narod­ naya Volya at the very beginning of die reign of Alexander III “submitted” to the government the very alternative which Social-Democracy now submits to Nicholas II, namely, either revolutionary struggle or the renunciation of autocracy.
(See the letter of the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya to Alexander III, dated March 22 (10), 1881, in which two con­ ditions are put: 1) general amnesty to all political offenders; 2) the convening of an assembly of representatives of the whole of the Russian people on the basis of universal suffrage, free press, free speech and right of assembly.
*) Mr.
R.
N.
S.
knows perfectly well that many people, not only among the intelligentsia, but also among the working class, “think seriously” about a violent revolution.
Read page xxxix et seq.
of his article in which reference is made to “revolutionary Social-Democracy,” which possesses a “mass basis and intellectual forces,” which is advancing towards “determined political struggle,” towards the “sanguinary struggle of revolutionary Russia against the auto-cratic-bureaucratic regime.
” (P.
xli.
) There is not the slightest doubt, therefore, that R.
N.
S.
’s “loyal speeches” are merely a trick, an attempt to influence the government (or “public opin­ ion”) by demonstrating his (or other people’s) modesty.
Mr.
R.
N.
S.
, by the way, thinks that the term “struggle” may be given a very wide interpretation.
“The abolition of the Zemstvo,” he writes, “will place a trump card in the hands of revolutionary propagandists; we say this quite objectively [<sicZ] without that sense of revulsion that is usually roused by revolutionary action, although we are no admirers of this form [sic/] of struggle for political and social progress.
” This is, a most remarkable tirade.
If we remove the quasi-scientific for­ mula, which inappropriately flaunts its “objectivity” (since the author himself speaks of his preference for one or another form of activity or of struggle, to speak of his objectivity is like saying two and two equals one tallow candle), we shall find the old, old argument: you may believe me, gentlemen of the government, when / begin to talk about revolution, then things must be serious, for I am not at all inclined that way.
The ref­ erence to objectivity is nothing more nor less than a fig leaf intended to conceal subjective antipathy to revolution and rev­ olutionary activity.
And Mr.
R.
N.
S.
stands in need of conceal­ ment, because such antipathy is totally incompatible with the vow of Hannibal.
By the way, are we not making a mistake about this Hanni­ bal? Did he really take a vow to fight against the Romans, or only to fight for the progress of Carthage, whose progress, of course, in the final analysis, would injure Rome? Why should the term “struggle” be given such a “narrow” meaning? Mr.
R.
N.
S.
thinks it can be given a broader meaning.
By com­ paring the vow of Hannibal with the above-mentioned tirade, it would appear that fighting against the autocracy manifests itself in various “forms.
” One form is revolutionary, illegal struggle; another form is to “fight for political and social pro­ gress” in general, in other words, peaceful legal activity, im­ planting culture within the limits permitted by the autocracy.
H Lenin H We do not doubt in the least that it is possible even under autocracy to carry on legal activity which will promote Russian progress—in some cases promoting technical progress rather rapidly, in a few cases promo-ting social progress insignificant­ ly, and, in exceptional cases, promoting political progress to an infinitesimal degree.
We may argue about the dimensions and possibilities of this infinitesimal progress, to what extent iso­ lated cases of such progress are capable of paralysing the mass corruption which die autocracy constantly sows among the population everywhere.
But to include, even indirectly, peace­ ful legal activity in the term, “to fight against the autocracy”— means facilitating this work of corruption and causing the ordinary Russian people to realise still less than diey do al­ ready their responsibility as citizens for everything the govern­ ment does.
Unfortunately, Mr.
R.
N.
S.
is not alone among the illegal writers who strive to obliterate the difference between revolu­ tionary struggle and peaceful cultural work.
He has a prede­ cessor in the person of R.
M.
, the author of die article, “Our Realities,” published in the celebrated Special Supplement to Rabochaya MysL (September 1899.
) In his controversy with the Social-Democratic revolutionaries, he wrote: “The fight for rural and urban local government, the fight for public schools, the fight for public courts, the fight for public aid to the famine-stricken population, etc.
, all comprise the fight against the autocracy.
This social struggle, which for some unexplained reason fails to attract die benevolent interest of many Russian revolutionary writers, as we have seen, has not been waged by the Russian public since yesterday.
.
.
.
The question now is how should these separate social strata .
.
.
carry on the fight against the autocracy in the most successful manner possible.
.
.
.
The principal question for us is, how .
.
.
should this social struggle against the autocracy be waged by our work­ ers, whose movement our revolutionaries regard as the best means for overthrowing the autocracy.
” (Pp.
8-9.
) As will be seen, R.
M.
thinks it superfluous to conceal his antipathy for revolutionaries; he quite openly declares legal opposition and peaceful work to be fighting the autocracy, and considers the most important question to be, how the workers should conduct “this” fight.
Mr.
R.
N.
S.
is not nearly so simple and frank, but the kinship between the political tendencies of this liberal and of the ardent worshippers of the labour movement pure and simple comes out very prominently.
1 As for “objectivity,” it should be noted that Mr.
R.
N.
S.
some­ times plainly casts off his “objectivity.
” He is “objective” when he speaks of the labour movement, of its organic growth, of the future inevitable struggle revolutionary Social-Democracy will wage against the autocracy and when he slates that the aboli­ tion of the Zemstvos will inevitably drive the liberals to organise an illegal parly.
All this is set forth in a very business-like and sober manner, so sober indeed that one can only rejoice that the labour movement in Russia is so well understood in lib­ eral circles.
But when Mr.
R.

begins to talk, not about fighting the enemy, but about the possibility of “subduing” him, he immediately loses his “objectivity,” gives expression to his real sentiments, and even passes from the indicative mood to the imperative.
“Only in the event of men being found among the ruling class courageous enough to submit to history and compel the autocracy to submit to it, will the final and sanguinary struggle between revolutionary Russia and the autocratic-bureaucratic regime be avoided.
.
.
.
No doubt there are men among the higher bureaucracy who do not sympathise with a reactionary policy.
.
.
.
These men, the only men who have direct access to the throne, never dare express their convictions openly.
.
.
.
Per­ haps the enormous shadow of the inevitable, historical day of judg­ ment, the shadow of great events, will cause the governing circle to waver and induce it to destroy the iron system of reactionary policy while 1 “The economic organisations of the workers,*’ says Mr.
R.
N.
S.
in an­ other passage, “will serve as a school for the practical political training of the masses of the workers.
” We would advise our author to be more careful in employing the term “practical,” so beloved by the knights of opportunism.
It cannot be denied that under certain conditions the in­ dustrial organisations of the workers may help very considerably toward their political training (no more than it can be denied that under other circumstances they may help toward their political corruption).
But the masses of the workers can obtain real political training only by their general participation in the revolutionary movement, including epen street fighting and civil war against the champions of political and economic slavery.
IV there is yet time.
Comparatively little is required for this now.

.
.
Per­ haps it [the government] will understand before it is too late the fatal danger of protecting the autocratic regime at all costs.
Perhaps even be­ fore it has to face revolution, it will grow weary of its fight against the natural and historically necessary development of liberty, and will waver in its ‘irreconcilable* policy.
Ceasing to be consistent in its fight against liberty, it will be obliged to open the door wider and wider for it Per­ haps.
.
.
.
No, not perhaps, but so be it!” [Author’s italics.
] Amen! is all that we need add to this loyal and lofty mo­ nologue.
Our Hannibal makes such rapid progress that he now appears before us in a third form.
The first was—fight against the autocracy, the second—implant culture, the third—call upon the enemy to submit and attempt to frighten him with a “shadow.
” What passion! We quite agree with our respected Mr.
R.
N.
S.
that nothing in the world frightens our bigoted Russian government more than “shadows.
” But immediately be­ fore proceeding to conjure up shadows, our author, in referring to the growth of the revolutionary forces and to the impending revolutionary outbreak, exclaimed: “We foresee with profound sorrow the horrible sacrifice in men and cultural forces that will have to be made for this madly aggressive conservative policy, which has neither political sense nor even a shadow of moral justification.
” What a bottomless chasm of unction and doc-trinairism is revealed by this conclusion to an argument about the revolutionary outbreak! The author completely fails to under­ stand the enormous historical significance it would have if, for once at least, the people of Russia taught the government a good lesson.
Instead of pointing to the “horrible sacrifices” the people have been and are making for absolutism, and rousing their hatred and indignation and a passion to fight the auto­ cracy, you mention future sacrifices in order to frighten people away from fighting.
Gentlemen! Rather than spoil your arguments by such an ending it would have been far better had you entire­ ly refrained from arguing about the “revolutionary outbreak” Apparently, you do not wish to create “great events,” but merely to talk about the “shadows of great events,” and then only with “men who haw access to the throne.
” Our legal press, too, as wre know’, is chock full of such talk with shadows and about shadows, and in order to give sub­ stance to the shadows, it has become fashionable to refer to the “great reforms” and to sing hallelujahs to them, full of con­ ventional lies.
An author writing under the surveillance of the censor may sometimes be forgiven these lies, for he cannot otherwise express his striving for political reforms.
But no cen­ sorship hovered over Mr.
R.
N.
S.
He writes: “The great re­ forms were not devised to crown the triumph of the bureau­ cracy.
” How evasive and apologetic this is! By whom “devised”? By Herzen, Chernyshevsky, Unkovsky and those who were with them? But these people demanded ever so much more than these “reforms” provided, and because of this, they were sub­ jected to the persecution of the government that introduced the “great” reforms.
Were they devised by the government and those who blindly followed it singing hallelujahs, while turning to snarl at the “termagants”? But tire government strove by every means in its power to concede as little as possible, and to cur­ tail the democratic demands precisely for the purpose of “crown­ ing the triumph of the bureaucracy.
” Mr.
R.
N.
S.
is perfectly well aware of these historical facts, and obscures them only because they entirely refute his magnanimous theory concerning the possibility of “subduing” the autocracy.
It is impossible to ‘be submissive in politics, and only out of unbounded simplicity (and sly and unctuous simplicity) can the time-honoured police methods of divide et impere—divide and rule, yield the unim­ portant to preserve the essential, give with one hand, and take with the other—be taken for subduing.
.
When the govern­ ment of Alexander II devised and introduced the ‘great reforms,5 it did not at the same time deliberately set out to cut off every legal path the Russian people had to political liberty; it did not carefully weigh every step and every paragraph of the law with this end in view.
’5 This is untruel The government of Alexander II, in “devising” the reforms and introducing them, deliberately set out from the very beginning to reject the demands for polit­ ical liberty put forward at the time.
Krom beginning to end it cut off every legal path to liberty; for it retorted to the most simple appeals with repressions, it never permitted free­ dom to be discussed freely.
It is sufficient even to recall the facts mentioned in Witte’s Memorandum, which we quoted above, to refute Mr.
R.
N.
S.
’s paeans of praise.
Concerning the persons in the government of Alexander II, Witte expresses himself as follows: “It must be observed that the prominent statesmen of the ’sixties, whose celebrated names will be preserved by a grateful posterity, did greater things in their time than have ever been done by their successors; they toiled over the renovation of our state and social system from sincere conviction, not to fnistrate the strivings of their ruler, but out of un­ bounded loyalty to him.
” (P.
67 of the Memorandum.
) What is true is true.
From sincere conviction .
.
.
out of un­ bounded loyalty to the ruler at the head of the police gang.
.
.
.
After this, we must not be surprised that Mr.
R.
N.
S.
says very little about the extremely important question of the role of the Zemstvos in the struggle for political liberty.
Apart from the usual references to the “practical” and “cultural” work of the Zemstvos, he mentions in passing their “educational polit­ ical significance.
” He says that the “Zemstvos have political significance” and that “the Zemstvos, as Mr.
Witte clearly sees, are dangerous [to the present system] only because of the historical trend of their development—as the embryo of the constitu­ tion.
” And at the end of these seemingly casual remarks we get the following attack upon revolutionaries: “We value Mr.
Witte*» work, not only because of the truth it tells about the autocracy, but also as a precious political testimonial to the Zemstvo granted by the bureaucracy itself.
This testimonial is an excellent reply to those who, owing to their lack of political education, or because they are carried away by revolutionary phrases [src/1, refused and refuse to see the enormous political significance of the Russian Zemstvos and their legal cultural activity.
” Who has revealed a lack of education? Who is carried away by phrases? Where and when? With whom does Mr.
R.
N.
S.
disagree? And why? To these questions no reply is forthcoming, for our author’s attack is nothing more than an expression of his hostility towards revolutionaries which has been revealed to us by other passages in his article.
The following queer explanatory note still leaves the subject obscure: “We do not by these words desire [?!] to insult revolutionaries whose moral courage and struggle against tyranny cannot he too high­ ly appraised.
” What is the purpose of this remark? What con­ nection is there between moral courage and lack of ability to appreciate the Zemstvos? Mr.
R.
N.
S.
has indeed fallen out of the frying pan into the 'fire.
First of all he “insults” revolution­ aries by making an unsupported and “anonymous” (i.
e.
, it is not known against whom it is levelled) charge of ignorance and phrasemongering, and then he again “insults” them by assuming that they can be made to swallow the pill of the charge of ignorance if it is gilded with the recognition of their moral cour­ age.
To complete the confusion, Mr.
R.
N.
S.
contradicts himself by declaring, in one breath as it were with those “carried away by revolutionary phrases,” that “the modem Russian Zemstvo .
.
.
has not sufficient political weight to impress or frighten anyone by its own direct power.
.
.
.
It can barely maintain its own modest position.
.
.
.
” “Such institutions [like the Zemstvo] .
.
.
may become a menace to this [autocratic] system only in die remote future and only as a result of the cultural development of the whole country.
” VI Let us, however, try to analyse die subject about which Mr.
R.
N.
S.
speaks so angrily and vapidly.
The facts we have quoted above show that the “political significance” of the Zemstvos, i.
e.
, their significance as a factor in the struggle for political liberty, lies principally in the following: first, these bodies of represent­ atives of our propertied classes (and particularly the landed aristocracy) serve as a constant contrast between elected institu­ tions and the bureaucracy; they give rise to constant conflicts between these two; they expose at every step the reactionary character of irresponsible tsarist officialdom, and foster discon­ tent and opposition to the bureaucratic government? Secondly, the Zemstvos, which are attached to the bureaucratic lSee the extremely detailed treatment of this aspect of the question in the pamphlet by P.
B.
Axelrod, The Historical Position and the Mutual Relations Between Liberal and Socialist Democracy in Russia, Geneva, 1898.
See particularly pp.
5, 8, 11-12, 1719, chariot like a superfluous fifth wheel, strive to consolidate their position and to enhance their significance; they strive towards a constitution; as Witte himself expresses it, they “unconsciously march towards” it by petitioning for it For that reason they prove to be unsuitable allies for the government in its fight against the revolutionaries; they maintain a benevolent neutrality towards the latter and render them undoubted if indirect service by causing the government to waver in its measures of repression at critical moments.
Of course, institutions, which hitherto have proved capable, at best, of making only liberal petitions and of maintaining benevolent neutrality, cannot be regarded as an “im­ portant,” or to any degree an independent, factor in the political struggle; but it cannot be denied that the Zemstvos represent one of the auxiliary factors in the struggle.
In this sense we are prepared, if you will, even to regard the Zemstvos as a piece of the constitution.
Perhaps the reader will say: then you agree with Mr.
R.
N.
S.
who does not claim any more for them? Not at all.
This is where our difference with him begins.
Let us admit for the sake of argument that the Zemstvos are— a piece of the constitution.
But ilt is a piece that was used to de­ coy Russian “society” away from a constitution.
It was a relat­ ively unimportant position which the autocracy conceded to growing democracy in order to retain its principal positions, in order to divide and disunite those who demanded political re­ forms.
We have seen bow this policy of disuniting succeeded in the ’sixties and in 1880-81 * on the basis of “confidence” in the Zemsitvos (“the embryo of the constitution”).
The question of the relation between the Zemstvos and political liberty is an incident in the general question of the relation between re­ form and revolution, and this incident serves to illustrate the narrow-mindedness and stupidity of the fashionable Bcmsteinian theory, which substitutes the struggle for reforms for revolution­ ary struggle, and declares (for example, through the lips of Mr.
Berdyaev) that the “principle of progress is: the better things are, the better.
” This principle in its general form is as untrue as its reverse: the worse things are, the better.
Revolutionaries, of course, will never abstain from fighting for reforms, from cap­ taring even minor and unimportant enemy positions, if they will serve to strengthen the attack and help to achieve complete vic­ tory.
But they will never forget that sometimes the enemy sur­ renders positions in order to disunite the attacking party, and thus defeat them more easily.
They will never forget that only by having the “ultimate aim” in view, only by appraising every step of the “movement” and every reform from the point of view of the general revolutionary struggle, will it be possible to safe­ guard the movement against false steps and disgraceful mistakes.
Now this aspect of the question—the significance of the Zem­ stvos as an instrument for strengthening the autocracy by means of half-hearted concessions, as an instrument for bringing over a certain section of the liberal public to the side of the auto­ cracy—Mr.
R.
N.
S.
has completely failed to understand.
He pre­ ferred to invent for his owTn use a doctrinaire scheme by which the Zemstvos and the constitution were joined by the straight line “formula”: the better things are, the better.
“If you first abolish the Zemstvos in Russia,” he says, addressing himself to Mr.
Witte, “and then increase the rights of the person, you deprive your­ self of a very good opportunity to give the country a moderate constitution, which would be the historical outgrowth of local government with a feudal estate tinge.
At all events you render the cause of conservatism a very bad service.
” What a beautiful and harmonious conception! Local government with an estate tinge—a wise conservative, having access to the throne— a moderate constitution.
The unfortunate tiling about it is that in actual practice the wise conservatives have on more than one occasion, thanks to the Zemstvos, found “very good opportunities” to withhold the constitution from the country.
Mr.
R.
N.
S.
’s peaceful “conception” bad its effect also on the slogan with which he concludes his article and which is printed precisely as a slogan, on a separate line and in heavy type: “Rights, and an Authoritative All-Russian Zemstvo!” It must be frankly confessed that this is as much an unworthy coquetting with the political prejudices of the broad masses of Russian lib­ erals as is Rabochaya Mysl's coquetting with the political pre­ judices of the broad masses of the workers,* It is our duty to protest against this coquetting in both cases.
The idea that the government o£ Alexander II did not cut off the legal path to lib­ erty, that the existence of the Zemstvos provides a very good op­ portunity for granting a moderate constitution to the country, and that the slogan, “Rights, and an Authoritative All-Russian Zem­ stvo/’ can serve as the banner of, we shall not say the revolu­ tionary, but at all events the constitutional movement, is a pre­ judice.
It is not a banner that can serve to separate enemies from allies, or help to direct and guide the movement; it is but a rag which can help only the most unreliable characters to attach them­ selves to the movement, and help the government to make still another attempt to pass off high-sounding promises and half­ hearted reforms.
One need not be a prophet to be able to pro­ phesy that: our revolutionary movement will reach its apogee and the liberal ferment in society will increase tenfold, and then new Loris-Melikovs and Ignatyevs will appear in the government and inscribe on their banner: “Rights, and an Authoritative Zemstvo.
” But if this should come to pass, it would be to the extreme dis­ advantage of Russia and to the extreme advantage of the gov­ ernment.
If any considerable section of the liberals put their faith in this banner, and, allowing themselves to be carried away by it, attack the revolutionary “termagants” in the rear, the lat­ ter may find themselves isolated, and the government will try to restrict itself to a minimum of concessions in the form of an advisory and aristocratic constitution.
Whether this attempt will be successful or not depends upon the outcome of the decisive battle between the revolutionary proletariat and the government.
But of one thing we may be certain, and that is, that the liberals will be cheated.
With the aid of slogans like those advanced by Mr.
R.
N.
S.
(“Authoritative Zemstvo,” or “Zemshchina,” etc.
) the government will decoy them like puppies away from the rev­ olutionaries and then will take them by the scruff of the neck and thrash them with the whip of the so-called reaction.
And when that happens, gentlemen, we shall say: serve you right! Why.
instead of demanding the abolition of absolutism, are such moderate and carefully worded desiderata put forward in the form of concluding slogans? First of all, for the sake of the philistine doctrinairism which desires to render a “service to conservatism” and which believes that the government will be mollified by such moderation and become “subdued” by it.
Sec­ ondly, in order to “unite the liberals.
” Indeed, the slogan: “Rights, and an Authoritative Zemstvo” can, perhaps, serve to unite all liberals in the same way as (in the opinion of the Economists) the slogan “a kopek on the ruble” will unite all the workers.
But will not such unity be a loss rather than a gain? Unity is an advantage when it raises all those who are united to the level of the intelligent and resolute programme of the thing that unites.
Unity is a disadvantage when it degrades those who are united to the level of the prejudices of the masses.
And among a large number of Russian liberals there is undoubtedly a widespread prejudice that the Zemstvo is indeed the “embryo of the constitution,” 1 the “natural,” peaceful and gradual growth of which is accidentally retarded by the intrigues of certain wicked favourites, that only a few petitions are necessary in order to “subdue” the autocrat, that legal cultural work gener­ ally, and Zemstvo work in particular, has “considerable political significance” which relieves those who express mere verbal hos­ tility to the autocracy of the obligation of actively supporting 1 In regard to what may be expected from the Zemstvo it may not be without interest to cite the following opinion expressed by Prince P.
V.
Dolgorukov in his Listok LSAeef] published in the ’sixties.
(Burtsev, pp.
63-66.
) “In examining the principal regulations governing the Zemstvo institutions, we again come across the secret thought of the government continually breaking out into the light, viz.
, overwhelm with generosity; loudly proclaim: ‘See how much I am giving you!’ but give as little as possible, and even impose restrictions upon the enjoyment of the little that is given.
.
.
.
Under the present autocratic system, the Zemstvo in­ stitutions do not and cannot bring any benefits, and will not and cannot have any significance, but they are pregnant with the embryo of fruitful development in the future.
.
.
.
Probably the new Zemstvo institutions are destined to serve as the foundation of the future constitutional order in Russia.
.
.
.
But as long as Russia lacks a constitutional system of gov­ ernment.
as long as the autocracy exists, and as long as freedom of the press is denied, the Zemstvo institutions will be doomed to remain political phantoms, mute assemblies of Zemstvo councillors.
” Thus even in the ’sixties, Dolgorukov was not very optimistic.
The forty years that have elapsed since then have taught us much and have demon­ strated that the Zemstvos were destined by “fate” (and also by the gov­ ernment) to serve as the basis for a whole series of measures which have crerwAe/mcd the constitutionalists.
the revolutionary struggle against die autocracy in one way or another, etc.
Undoubtedly, the unity of the liberals would be very useful and desirable, but only a unity the aim of which is to combat outworn prejudices and not to .
play up to them, to raise the general level of our political development (or rather undevelopmeni) and not to sanction it, in a word, only unity for the purpose of supporting the illegal struggle and not for the purpose of opportunistic phrasemongering about the political significance of legal activity can be of any use.
To is­ sue the slogan, “An Authoritative Zemstvo/’ to liberals can no more be justified than issuing the political slogan, “freedom to strike,” etc,, to the workers.
Under the autocracy any sort of Zemstvo, however “authoritative” it may be, will inevitably be a deformity, incapable of development, while under a constitution the Zemstvo will immediately lose its present-day “political” significance.
The unity of liberals may be brought about in two ways: by forming an independent liberal party (illegal, of course), or by organising liberal aid for revolutionaries.
Mr.
R.
N.
S.
points to the first form, but .
.
.
if what he says in this connection is to be taken as a genuine expression of the views and prospects of liberalism, then it gives no ground for very great optim­ ism.
He writes: “Without a Zemstvo, the Zemstvo liberals will have to form a liberal party, or abandon the historical stage as an organised force.
We are convinced that the organisation of liberals in an illegal party, although with a very moderate pro­ gramme and employing very moderate methods, will be the in­ evitable result of the abolition of the Zemstvo.
” But if it will be only die result of the “abolition” of the Zemstvos, then we shall have to wait a long time for it, for even Witte does not wish to abolish them, while the Russian government is always concerned with preserving outward appearances, even if the internal content is completely extracted.
That a liberal party will be a very mod­ erate one is quite natural, and it is useless to expect that the movement among the bourgeoisie (for only on that movement can a liberal party be based) will give rise to any other.
But what should be the activities and the “methods” of such a party? Mr.
R.
N.
S.
.
does not explain.
He says: “Taken by itself, an il­ legal liberal party, being an organisation consisting of the most moderate and least mobile of the opposition elements, cannot develop either particularly wide or particularly intensive activ­ ity.
.
.
.
” We think, however, that in a certain sphere, say with­ in the restricted limits of local, and above all, of Zemstvo in­ terests, the liberal party could very well develop wide and in­ tensive activity, for example, the organisation of political ex­ posures.
.
• But with such activity being carried on by other parties, especially by the Social-Democratic or Labour Party, the liberal party, even without entering into any direct agree­ ment with the Social-Democrats, can become a very important factor.
.
.
Very true; and the reader would naturally expect the author, at least in general outline, to describe the work of this “factor.
” But instead of doing that, Mr.
R.
N.
S.
describes the growth of .
revolutionary Social-Democracy and concludes: “With the existence of a pronounced political movement .
.
.
a liberal opposition, if it is in the least organised, can play an important political role; if proper tactics are adopted, a moderate party always stands to gain from the growing acuteness of the struggle between the extreme elements in society.
.
.
And .
that is all! The “role” of the “factor” (which has already managed to convert itself from a party into an “opposition”) is to “gain” from the growing acuteness of the struggle.
Mention is made of what the liberals stand to gain, but not a word is said about the liberals taking part in the fight.
An oversight; a providential one in fact.
.
.
.
Russian Social-Democrats have never closed their eyes to the fact that the political liberties for which they are fighting will first and foremost benefit the bourgeoisie.
Only a Socialist who is steeped in .
the worst prejudices of utopianism or reactionary Narodism would object to carrying on the fight against the auto­ cracy for that reason.
The bourgeoisie will benefit by these liber ties and rest on its laurels.
The proletariat, however, needs liberty in order to develop the fight for socialism to the utmost.
And Social-Democracy will persistently carry on the fighit for liber­ ation, no matter what the attitude of the various strata of the bourgeoisie towards this fight may be.
In the interest of the polit-ioal struggle, we must support every opposition that is raised against the oppression of the autocracy, no matter on what grounds it may be raised and by what social stratum it is expressed.
For that reason, we are by no means in­ different to the opposition expressed by our liberal bour­ geoisie generally, and by our Zemslvo-ists in particular.
If the liberals succeed in organising themselves in an illegal party, so much the better.
We shall welcome the growth of polit­ ical consciousness among the propertied classes; we shall sup­ port their demands, we shall endeavour to work so that the activ­ ities of the Social-Democrats and the liberals mutually supple­ ment each other.
1 But even if they fail to do so (which is more probable), we shall not give them up in disgust.
We shall try to establish contacts with individual liberals, make tliem ac­ quainted with our movement, support them by exposing in the labour press all the despicable acts of tlie government and the local authorities, and try to induce them to support the revolu­ tionaries.
Such an exchange of service between liberals and So­ cial-Democrats is going on already, it must be extended and made constant But while always ready to carry on this ex­ change of services, we shall never, under any circumstances, cease to carry on a determined struggle against the illusions which are so widespread in politically undeveloped Russian so­ ciety generally and in Russian liberal society in particular.
In regard to the Russian revolutionary movement we may say, para­ phrasing the celebrated statement of Marx, in regard to the Re­ volution of 1848, that its progress lies not so much in the achieve­ ment of positive gains, as in emancipation from harmful illusions.
* We have emancipated ourselves from the illusions of anarchism and of Narodnik socialism, from contempt for poli-1The present writer had occasion to point out the utility of a liberal party four years ago, in commenting upon the Narodnoye Pravo [People's Right] Party.

We said: .
.
If, however, there are in the party [Narodnoye Pravo] not masquerade, but real non-socialist politicians, non-socialist democrats, then this party can do not a little good by striving to draw closer to the political opposition elements among our bourgeoisie.

) * tics, from the belief that Russia will develop in its own peculiar way, from the conviction that the people are ready for revolu­ tion, and from die theory of the seizure of power in single com­ bat between the heroic intelligentsia and the autocracy.
It is time our liberals emancipated themselves from the illu­ sion which would appear to be theoretically bankrupt, but which reveals extreme vitality in practice, viz.
, that parleys with the Russian autocracy are possible, that some sort of Zemstvo is die embryo of the constitution, and diat the sincere adherents of the latter can fulfil their vow of Hannibal by patient legal activ­ ity and patient appeals to the enemy to become subdued.
June-July 1901.
DRAFT OF A PROGRAMME FOR THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF RUSSIA * [A] I.
Commodity production is developing in Russia at an in­ creasing rate and the domination of the capitalist system of pro­ duction is becoming more and more complete.
II.
The continuous advance of technique results in small pro­ duction being squeezed out by large-scale production.
The important part of the means of production (land and factories, tools and machinery, railways and other means of communica­ tion) is becoming concentrated in the hands of a relatively in­ significant number of capitalists and big landowners as their private property.
Independent small producers (peasants, home workers, artisans) are being more and more ruined, losing their means of production and thus becoming transformed into pro­ letarians, or else into die servants and tributaries of capital.
An ever increasing number of workers are compelled to fall back on the sale of their labour power; they become wage labourers dependent on the owners and by their labour create the wealth of the latter.
III.
The greater the advances made by technical progress, the more does the growth of the demand for labour power lag be­ hind the growth of its supply, and the greater become the possi­ bilities of die capitalists of raising the rate of exploitation of the workers.
Insecurity of existence and unemployment, the bur­ den of exploitation and every kind of humiliation become the lot of increasingly wide strata of the working population.
IV.
This process is still further aggravated by industrial crises, which are the inevitable outcome of the fundamental con­ tradictions of capitalism.
The poverty and destitution of the masses go hand in hand with the waste of social wealth as a 224 consequence of the impossibility of finding markets for the com­ modities produced.
V.
Thus the gigantic development of the productive forces of social, and increasingly socialised, labour is accompanied by the fact that all the chief advantages of this development are mono­ polised by an insignificant minority of the population.
The growth of the wealth of society is accompanied by the growth of social inequality; the gulf between the class of owners (bour­ geoisie) and the class of the proletariat becomes deeper and wider.
[B] VI.
But while all these inevitable contradictions of capitalism grow and develop, the numbers and the solidarity, the discontent and the indignation of the proletariat also grow, the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class is aggravated and the desire grows to throw' off the intolerable yoke of capitalism.
VII.
The emancipation of the working class can only be the task of the working class itself.
All the other classes of con­ temporary society stand for preserving the foundations of the existing economic order.
The real emancipation of the working class requires a social revolution—which is being prepared by the whole evolution of capitalism—i.
e.
, the abolition of the pri­ vate ownership of the means of production, their transforma­ tion into the property of the state, and the substitution for the capitalist production of commodities of the socialist organisa­ tion of the production of articles for the benefit of society as a whole, with the object of securing the greatest benefit and the free and all-round development of all its members.
VIII.
This proletarian revolution will completely abolish the division of society into classes and, consequently, all the social and political inequality arising out of that division.
IX.
In order to carry out this social revolution the proletariat must win political power, which will make it the master of the situation and allow it to remove all obstacles that stand in the way of its great objective.
In this sense the dictatorship of the IS Lealo U proletariat is the necessary political condition of the social rev­ olution.
X.
Russian Social-Democracy sets itself the task of laying bare before the workers the irreconcilable antagonism between their interests and the interests of the capitalists, of showing to the proletariat the historical significance, character and condition of the social revolution it is destined to carry out, and of organ­ ising a revolutionary class party capable of directing all the manifestations of the struggle of the proletariat.
XI.
But the development of international exchange and of production for the world market has created so close a link be­ tween all the nations of the civilised world that today the work­ ing class movement had to be, and long ago became, an interna­ tional movement.
Russian Social-Democracy regards itself as a unit of the world army of the proletariat, as part of interna­ tional Social-Democracy.
XII.
The immediate objectives of Russian Social-Democracy arc, however, considerably modified by the fact that in our coun­ try numerous survivals of the pre-capitalist, feudal social order very greatly retard the development of productive forces, render impossible the complete and all-round development of the class struggle of the proletariat, keep down the standard of living of the working population, determine the barbarous Asiatic forms under which the peasantry, numbering many millions, is dying out, and keep all the people in a state of ignorance, inequality and subjection.
XIII.
The most important of these survivals of the serf system and the most powerful bulwark of all this barbarism is the tsarist autocracy.
It is the worst and most dangerous enemy of the movement for the emancipation of the proletariat, and of the cultural development of the whole of the people.

” CRITICISM OF PLEKHANOV’S SECOND DRAFT Four fundamental defects permeate the whole draft and make it, in my opinion, quite unacceptable: 1) Owing to the way in which the most important section, containing the characterisation of capitalism, is formulated, the draft is not that of a programme of the proletariat fighting against very real manifestations of a very definite capitalism, but that of a programme of an economic textbook on capitalism in general.
2) The programme is particularly unsuitable for the party of the Russian proletariat, because the evolution of Russian capitalism and the contradictions and social evils generated by Russian capitalism are almost entirely evaded and obscured by this system of characterising capitalism in general.
The parly of the Russian proletariat must formulate its charge against Rus­ sian capitalism, its declaration of war on Russian capitalism in the most unambiguous manner.
This is all the more necessary inasmuch as the Russian programme cannot be identical in this respect with the European programmes; the latter speak of capitalism and of bourgeois society without stating explicitly that these conceptions are applicable to Austria and to Germany and so on, because that goes without saying.
In relation to Russia this cannot be taken for granted.
To be content with stating that capitalism “in its developed form” is distinguished in general by such and such character­ istics and that in Russia capitalism “is becoming predominant” is to shirk that concrete charge and declaration of war which for a practical, fighting party is the most important thing.
For this reason the draft does not achieve one of the principal objects of a programme, which is, to serve the Party as a guide in its day-to-day propaganda and agitation concerning all the various manifestations of Russian capitalism.
231 3) Some of the most important points have been slated in a form so vague that it will inevitably give rise to a number of very dangerous misunderstandings and hinder our theoretical struggle and propaganda.
Thus, the growth of large-scale pro« duction is confined to “industrial” undertakings.
The evolu­ tion of capitalism in agriculture is either obscured or left out altogether.
Further, instead of the “dictatorship of the prole­ tariat” we have “a revolution, which shall be carried out by the proletariat, supported by the other strata of the population that suffer from capitalist exploitation,” and instead of the class struggle of the proletariat we have “the struggle of the toiling and exploited mass.
” This formulation contradicts the fundamental principle of the International: “the emancipation of the working class can only be the task of the working class itself.
” Apart from the proletariat, the other sections of the “toiling and exploited mass” (i.
e.
, mainly the small producers) are only partly revolutionary in their struggle against the bour­ geoisie.
To be precise, they are revolutionary “only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat .
.
.
they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletar-rial.
” (Communist Manifesto.
) But the reactionary character of the small producer is not brought out in the draft, so that speak­ ing generally the relation of the proletariat to “the toiling and exploited mass” is wrongly stated.
For example, the draft says: “The struggle [of the toiling and exploited mass] and first of all the struggle of its most advanced representative, the prole­ tariat, becomes more acute.
” The “aggravation of the struggle” of the small producers finds expression in anti-Semitism, and in Gesarism, and in peasant unions directed against the farm hands and even in the struggle between the social Gironde and the Mountain.
The fact that the proletariat represents the whole of the toiling and exploited mass must find its expression in the programme in the fact that we accuse capitalism of being the cause of the poverty of the masses (and not of the working class alone) and the cause of the unemployment of “ever more extensive strata of.
the toiling population”, (and not only of the working class), .
4) The draft constantly tends to become a commentary in­ stead of a programme in the strict sense of the word.
A pro­ gramme must give concise statements, containing not one super­ fluous word, and leave die work of explanation to commentaries, pamphlets, agitation, etc.
For this reason Engels was perfectly right when he said that the Erfurt programme was too long, too circumstantial and too full of repetition, so that it tended to be­ come a commentary.
In the present draft this defect is still more apparent, there is a dreadful amount of repetition; the attempts to include an explanation of the process (instead of merely a characterisation of the process) fail to achieve their end, and only stretch the programme to an impossible degree.
February-March 1902.
THE WORKERS’ PARTY AND THE PEASANTRY * Forty years have passed since the peasants were emancipated.
It is quite natural that the public should, with particular en­ thusiasm, celebrate March 3 (February 19), the anniversary of the fall of old feudal Russia and the beginning of the epoch which promised Russia liberty and prosperity.
We must not for­ get that while the laudatory ceremonial speeches contain much that sincerely expresses hatred towards serfdom and all its mani­ festations, they also contain much hypocrisy.
The now fashion­ able estimation of this “great” reform as “the emancipation of the peasantry with a grant of land with the aid of state compen­ sation” is utterly hypocritical and false.
The peasants, as a matter of fact, wrere emancipated from the land, for the plots of land which they had owned for centuries were considerably whittled down.
Hundreds and thousands of peasants were com­ pletely deprived of land, and settled on a wretched fourth of an allotment.
In fact, the peasants were doubly robbed: not only were their allotments cut down, but they had to pay “com­ pensation” for the portion of that which was left to them and which had always been in their possession, and, moreover, the price they had to pay was considerably higher than its actual value.
Ten years after the emancipation of the peasantry the landlords themselves admitted to the government officials, who were investigating the state of agriculture, that the peasants were compelled to pay not only for their land, but also for their personal liberty.
And although the peasants paid for their liber­ ation, they did ir t become free men; for twenty years they re­ mained “temporarily bonded”; they were left and have re­ mained to this day the lower estate, who could be flogged, who paid special imposts, who had no right freely to leave the semi-feudal commune, had no right freely to dispose of their own land, or to settle freely in any part of the state.
234 Our peasant reform is not a tribute to the magnanimity of the government; on the contrary, it serves as a great historical ex-ample of how soiled everything is that leaves the hands of the autocratic government.
Owing to the military defeats,* the seri­ ous financial difficulties and the menacing discontent of the peas­ antry, the government was compelled to emancipate the latter.
** The tsar himself admitted that the peasants ought to be emanci­ pated from above, lest they emancipate themselves from below.
But in undertaking the task of emancipating the peasantry, the government did all it possibly could to satisfy the greed of the “injured” serf owners.
The government did not even hesitate to play the dirty trick of reshuffling the men who were appointed to carry out the reform, although these men had been selected from among the nobility themselves.
The first body of ar­ bitrators that was elected was dissolved, and replaced by men who were incapable of resisting the serf owners in their efforts to cheat the peasantry even in the process of redistributing the land.
The great reform could not be carried out without resort to military executions and the shooting down of the peas­ antry who refused to accept the statutory charter.
*** It is not surprising, therefore, that the best men of the time, muzzled by the censors, met this great reform with a curse—of silence.
The peasant, “emancipated” from serf labour, emerged from the hands of the reformers a crushed, plundered, degraded man, tied to his plot of land, so much so that nothing was left for him to do except “voluntarily” accept serf labour.
And the peas­ ant began to cultivate the land of his former master by “renting” from him the very land that had been “clipped” from his own allotment, and by hiring himself in the winter for work in the summer, in repayment of the loan of com which he had bor­ rowed from the landlord to feed his hungry family.
The “free labour,” for which the manifesto, drawn up by a Jesuit priest, called upon the peasantry to ask the “blessing of God,” turned out to be nothing more nor less than serf labour and bondage.
**** To the oppression of the landlords, which was preserved, thanks to the magnanimity of .
the officials who introduced and carried out the refomv"was added the oppression of capital The power of money, which crushed even the French peasant—who was emancipated from the power of the feudal landlords, not by miserable half-hearted reforms, but by a mighty popular rev­ olution—this power of money bore down with all its weight upon our semi-serf muzhik.
The peasant had to obtain money at all cosls in order to pay the taxes which had increased as a result of the beneficent reform, in order to rent land, to buy the few miserable articles of manufactured goods—which began to squeeze out the home manufactures of the peasant—to buy corn, etc.
The power of money not only crushed the peasantry, but split it up.
An enormous number of peasants were steadily ruined and converted into proletarians.
From the minority arose a small group of shrewd and greedy kulaks, who began to lay their avaricious hands upon the lands and farms of the peas­ ants, and who represented the first cadres of the rising rural bourgeoisie.
The forty years that have elapsed since the reform have been marked by this constant process of “de-peasantising” the peasants, a process of slow and painful extinction of the peasantry.
The peasants were reduced to the level of beggars.
They lived together with their cattle, they were clothed in rags and fed on weeds.
The peasants fled from their allotments, if they had anywhere to go, and even paid to be relieved of them, if they could induce anyone to take them over and continue the payments on the land which exceeded the income derived from it.
* The peasants were in a state of chronic starvation, and died in hundreds of thousands from famine and epidemics during bad harvests, which recurred with increasing frequency.
This is the state of our countryside even at the present time.
The question is: what is the way out, and by what means can we seek to improve the lot of the peasantry? The small peas­ antry may emancipate itself from the yoke of capital only by joining the labour movement, by helping the workers in their fight for the socialist system and for converting the land as well as other means of production (factories, works, machines, etc.
) into public property.
To attempt to save the peasantry by pro­ tecting their small farms aqd their small properties from the of capitalism -Would .
mean uselessly 'retarding social development and deceiving the peasantry with illusions about the possibility of achieving prosperity under capitalism; it would mean disuniting the toiling classes and creating a priv­ ileged position for the minority at the expense of the ma­ jority.
That is why Social-Democrats will always fight against senseless and harmful institutions like those which prohibit the peasant from disposing of his land, like mutual responsibility, the prohibition against freely leaving the peasant commune and the free acceptance into the commune of persons belonging to any estate.
As we have seen, however, our peasants are suf­ fering not so much from the oppression of capital as from the oppression of the landlords and the survivals of serfdom.
Ruth­ less struggle against these shackles, which have made the lot of the peasantry immeasurably worse, and which tie it hand and foot, is not only possible but even necessary for the sake of the entire social development of the country; for the hope­ less poverty, ignorance, tyranny and degradation, from which the peasants suffer, leave their impress upon the whole of our country—the impress of Asiatic barbarism.
Social-Democrats would not be performing their duty if they did not render every assistance to this struggle.
This assistance should take die form, to put it briefly, of carrying the class war into the countryside.
We have seen that in the modern Russian countryside two kinds of class antagonism exist side by side: first, the strug­ gle between the rural workers and the rural employers; and second, between the peasantry as a whole and the landlord class as a whole.
The first antagonism is developing and becoming more acute; the second is gradually diminishing.
The first is still wholly in the future; the second to a considerable degree already belongs to the past And yet in spite of this, it is the second antagonism that has the most vital and most practical significance for Russian Social-Democrats at the present time.
It goes without saying that we must utilise all the opportunities that present themselves to us to develop the class consciousness of the agricultural wage workers, and that we must pay atten­ tion to the urban workers who go into die country districts (for example, the mechanics employed on steam threshing machines, etc J and to the markets where agricultural labourers are hired.
This is an axiom for every Social-Democrat.
But our rural labourers are still too closely connected with the peasantry, they still share too closely the misfortunes oi the peasantry generally to enable the movement of the rural workers to assume national significance, either now or in the immediate future.
On the other hand, the question of sweeping away the survivals of serfdom, of driving the spirit of feudal inequality out of «the whole of the Russian state system and the degradation of tens of millions of the “common people,” are al-ready matters of national significance; and the party which claims to be the vanguard in the fight for liberty cannot ignore them.
The deplorable stale of the peaisantry has now become (in a more or less general form) almost universally recognised.
The phrase about “the defects” of the Reform of 1861, and about the need for state aid, has become a current truism.
It is our duty to point out that the misfortunes of the peasantry arise precisely from the class oppression of the peasantry; that the government is the loyal champion of the oppressing classes, and that those who sincerely and seriously desire a radical im­ provement in the conditions of the peasantry must seek, not add from the government, but to get rid of the oppression of the government and win political liberty.
It is said that the compensation rates are too high; there is talk about beneficial measures to reduce these payments, and to postpone the dates of payment.
Our reply to this is: these compensation pay­ ments are nothing more nor less than robbery of the peasantry by the landlords and the government, screened by legal forms and official phrases; they are nothing more nor less than tribute paid to the serf owners for emancipating their slaves.
We shall put forward the demand for the immediate and com­ plete abolition of compensation payments, the abolition of al! quit-rents, and the demand for the return of the hundreds of millions which the tsarist government has extorted from the peasants to satisfy the greed of the slave owners.
There is talk about the peasants not having sufficient land, about the need for state aid in providing the peasants with more land.
Our reply to this is: it is precisely because of state aid (aid to the landlords, of course) that the peasants in such an enormous number of cases were deprived of land that was vitally necessary to them.
We shall put forward the demand for the restoration to the peasantry of the land of which they were deprived and the lack of which still keeps them in a state of bondage and forced labour, i.
e.
, actually in a state of serf­ dom.
We shall put forward the demand for the establishment of peasant committees, which will remove the crying injustices committed against the emancipated slaves by the committees of the nobles set up by the tsarist government.
We shall demand the establishment of land courts, which will have the right to re­ duce the excessively high rents extorted from the peasants by the landlords by taking advantage of their hopeless position.
Before these courts the peasants will have the right to pro­ secute for usury all those who take advantage of their extreme need to impose extortionate terms upon them.
We shall take advantage of every opportunity to explain to the peasantry that the people who talk to them about the tutelage or the aid of the present slate are either fools or charlatans, and their worst enemies; that what die peasants stand in need of most is relief from the tyranny and oppression of the officials; that their com­ plete and absolute equality in all respects with all other classes must be recognised; that they must obtain complete liberty to migrate and move freely from place to place, the liberty to dispose of llieir lands as they please and the liberty to man­ age their own communal affairs and freely to dispose of the communal revenues.
The most common facts in the life of any Russian village provide a thousand themes for agitation on behalf of the above demands.
This agitation must be based upon the local, concrete and most pressing needs of the peas­ antry; they must not be confined to these needs, however, but must be steadily directed towards widening the outlook of the peasantry, towards developing their political consciousness.
The peasants must be made to understand the special place occupied in the state by the landlords and the peasants respectively, and they must be taught that the only way to emancipate the country­ side from the tyranny and oppression that reigns in it is to con­ vene an assembly of representatives of the people and to over­ throw die tyranny of the officials.
It is absurd and stupid to assert that the demands for political liberty would not be under­ stood by the workers: not only the workers who have experienced years of direct lighting with the factory employers and the po­ lice, who constantly witness the arbitrary arrests and persecution of their best lighters, not only these workers who are already in­ fected with socialism, but every intelligent peasant who thinks at all about the tilings he sees going on around him will under­ stand what the workers are fighting for, and will understand the significance of the Zenisky Sobor 1 which will emancipate the whole country from the tyranny of the hated officials.
Agitation on the basis of the direct and most urgent needs of the peasants will fulfill its purpose,’i.
e.
, carry the class war into the country­ side, only when it succeeds in combining every exposure of some “economic” evil with definite political demands.
But the question arises whether the Social-Democratic Labour Party can include in its programme demands like those referred to above.
Can it undertake to carry on agitation among the peas­ antry? Will it not lead to the scattering and diversion of our revolutionary forces, which are not very numerous as it is, from the principal and only reliable channel of the movement? Such objections are based on a misunderstanding.
We must unfailingly include in our programme demands for the emanci­ pation of our countryside from all the survivals of slavery, demands capable of rousing among the best section of the peas­ antry, if not an independent political struggle, then at all events a readiness consciously to support the working class struggle for emancipation.
We would be committing a mistake if we ad­ vocated measures which may retard social development, or arti­ ficially isolate the small peasantry from the growth of capital­ ism, from the development of large-scale production; but it would be a much more fatal mistake if we failed to utilise the labour movement for the purpose of spreading among the peas-* National Assembly.

Eng.
ed, antry the democratic demands which the Reform of February 19, 1861, failed to carry out because it was distorted by die landlords and live officials.
Our Party must include such de­ mands in its programme if it desires to take the lead of the whole people in tKe struggle against the autocracy.
1 But to in­ clude these points in our programme does not imply that we shall transfer the active revolutionary forces from the towns to the villages.
Such a thing cannot even be thought of.
Un­ doubtedly all the fighting elements of the Party must strive to go to the towns and industrial centres; only the industrial pro­ letariat is capable of conducting a determined and mass strug­ gle against the autocracy, only the industrial proletariat is cap­ able of employing such methods of struggle as organising pub­ lic demonstrations, or of issuing a regularly and widely circu­ lated, popular political newspaper.
We must include peasant de­ mands in our programme not in order to transfer convinced So­ cial-Democrats from the towns to the countryside, not in order to chain them to the village, but in order to guide the activities of those forces which cannot find an outlet anywhere except in the rural districts, in order to utilise for the cause of democracy, and for the political struggle for liberty, those ties with the rural districts which, owing to the force of circumstances, are main­ tained by not a few loyal Social-Democratic intellectuals and workers—ties which necessarily will grow and are growing with the growth of the movement.
We have long since outgrown the stage when we were a small detachment of volunteers, when the reserves of Social-Democratic forces consisted merely of circles of young men who had all “gone among die workers.
” Our move­ ment now has a whole army at its command, an army of work­ ers, stirred by the struggle for socialism and for liberty—an army of the intelligentsia who have been taking part in the movement, and who are already scattered over the whole length and breadth of Russia—an army of sympathisers whose eyes are 1 We have already drafted a Social-Democratic programme which in­ cludes the above-mentioned demands.
We hope—after this draft has been discussed and amended in conjunction wit|| the Emancipation of Labour group—to publish it as the draft programme of our Party in one of our forthcoming issues.
13 Lenin 11 turned with faith and hope upon the labour movement, and who are prepared to render it a thousand services.
We are confronted with the great task of organising this army in such a manner as will enable us not only to organise transient outbreaks, not only to strike casual and sporadic (and therefore not danger­ ous) blows at the enemy, but also to pursue the enemy steadily and persistently, in a determined struggle along the whole line, to harass the autocratic government wherever it sows oppres­ sion and gathers a harvest of hatred.
Can this aim be achieved without sowing the seeds of the class struggle and political consciousness among the many millions of the peasantry? Do not say it is impossible to sow these seeds among the peas­ antry! It is not only possible, it is already being done in a thousand ways which escape our attention and influence.
This will proceed much more widely and rapidly when we succeed in issuing slogans that will enable us to exercise this influence, and when we unfurl the banner of the emancipation of the Russian peasantry from all the survivals of shameful serf­ dom.
Country people who come into the towns already look with wonder, curiosity and interest upon the struggle of the workers that is going on there, a struggle which is unintelligible to them; and they carry the news of the struggle to the most remote parts of the country.
We can and must do our very best to convert the curiosity of spectators, if not into complete un­ derstanding, then at least into a vague consciousness that the workers are fighting for the interests of the whole people, and into increased sympathy for the struggle.
And when that is done, the day of victory of the revolutionary party over the police government will come more quickly than we ourselves ever expected or even guessed.
April 1901.
TO THE RURAL POOR * AN EXPLANATION FOR THE PEASANTS OF WHAT THE SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS WANT 1.
The Struggle of the Workers in the Towns Maky peasants must have heard by now of the labour disturb­ ances in the towns.
Some of them have themselves lived in St.
Petersburg or Moscow and worked in the factories and seem the riots, as the police call them.
Others have met workers who took part in the disturbances and were deported by tiie authori­ ties back to their villages.
Others again must have seen the leaflets issued by the workers, or books about the workers’ strug­ gle.
Still others have only heard the stories about what is going on in the towns from people who have travelled about.
At first it was only the students who rebelled, but now thous­ ands and tens of thousands of workers have risen in all the larger towns.
In most cases their fight is against their employ­ ers, against the manufacturers, against the capitalists.
The work­ ers declare strikes, all the workers at the factory stop work at the same time, demanding higher wages and demanding that instead of being made to work eleven or ten hours a day they should work no more than eight hours.
The workers also de­ mand oilier tilings that would make the workingman’s life less hard.
They want the workshops to be in better condition, and the machines to be protected by special appliances so as to prevent them from maiming the workers, they want their child­ ren to be able to go to school, and the sick to be given proper aid in the hospitals, they want the homes of the workers to be like human dwellings instead of being like dogs’ kennels.
But the police interfere with the workers’ struggle.
The police seize the workers, throw them into prison, and deport them with­ out trial back to their villages or even to Siberia.
The govern-243 '16 meat makes laws forbidding strikes and workers’ meetings.
But the workers go on with their fight against the police and against the government.
The workers say: we millions of working people have bent our backs long enough! We have worked for the rich and remained paupers long enough! We have allowed them to rob us long enough! We wish to combine to form unions, to unite the workers in one big workers’ association (a workers* party) and to unite our forces to obtain a belter life.
We are striving to obtain a new and better order of society: in this new’ and better society there shall be neither rich nor poor; all will have to work.
No longer will a handful of rich men enjoy the fruits of common toil; all the working people will enjoy them.
Machinery and other improvements will no longer serve to en­ rich the few at the expense of millions and tens of millions of people, but will contribute to make work easier for all.
This new and better kind of society is called socialist society.
The leachings of this society are called socialism.
The associations of the workers which fight for this better society are called So­ cial -Democratic parties.
In almost every country (except Russia and Turkey) there is such a party which exists openly.
In Rus­ sia the workers, together with Socialists from among the edu­ cated people, have also formed such a party; it is called the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
The government persecutes the Party, but the Party exists in secret, in spite of all prohibitions; it publishes newspapers and books and organises secret societies.
The workers not only meet in secret, they come out into the streets in crowds, they unfurl their banners bearing the inscriptions: “Long live the eight-hour day! Long live freedom, long live socialism!” The government savagely persecutes the workers for this* It even sends troops to fire on the workers.
Russian soldiers have killed Russian work­ ers in Yaroslavl, in St.
Petersburg, in Riga, in Rostov-on-Don and in Zlatoust.
j I < But the workers do not surrender.
They continue the fight.
They say: neither persecution, nor prison, nor deportations, nor penal servitude, nor death can make us afraid.
Our cause is a just cause.
We are fighting for the freedom and the happiness of all who work.
We are fighting to abolish violence and op­ pression, to put an end to the poverty of tens and hundreds of millions of people.
The workers are becoming more and more class conscious.
The number of Social-Democrats is growing fast in all countries.
We shall win in spite of all persecution.
The rural poor must clearly understand what sort of people these Social-Democrats are, what it is they want and what the rural poor musit do if they want to help the Social-Democrats to win happiness for the people.

What Do the Social-Democrats Want? The Social-Democrats are out first and foremost to win polit­ ical liberty.
They need political liberty in order to unite all the Russian workers in broad and open associations for the struggle for a new and better order of society, for a socialist society.
WTiat is political liberty? To understand this the peasant must begin by comparing his present state of freedom with serfdom.
Under serfdom a peasant could not even marry without the landlord’s permission.
Today the peasant is free to marry without anyone’s permission.
Under serfdom the peasant had to work for his landlord on the days fixed by the latter’s bailiff.
Today the peasant is free to choose the employer he will work for, the days he will work on, and for what wages.
Under serfdom the peasant could not leave his village without the landlord’s permission.
Today the peasant is free to go wherever he pleases—if the mzr1 allows him to go, if he is not in arrears with his taxes, if he can get a passport and if the governor or the police do not forbid migrations.
This means that even today the peasant is not quite free to go where he pleases, that he does not possess complete freedom of move­ ment: the peasant is still a semi-serf.
Presently we shall explain in detail why the Russian peasant is still a semi-serf and what he must do to change his condition.
Under serfdom the peasant had no right to acquire property without the landlord’s permission, and could not buy land.
To­ day the peasant is free to acquire any kind of property (but 1 The village community.

even today he is not free to leave the mir or to dispose of his land as he pleases).
Under serfdom the peasant could be flogged by the landlord.
Today the peasant cannot be flogged by the landlord, although he is still liable to corporal punishment.
This freedom is called civil liberty—freedom in family mat­ ters, in private matters, in matters of property.
The peasant and the worker arc free (although not quite free) to arrange their family life and their private business as they please, freely to dispose of their labour (choose their employer) and of their property.
But neither the Russian workers nor the Russian people as a whole are yet free to settle their national affairs as they please.
Just as the peasants used to be the serfs of individual landlords, so the people as a whole is the serf of the government officials.
The Russian people have not the right to choose their officials, nor the right to elect representatives to legislate for the whole country.
The Russian people have not even the right to meet to discuss slate affairs.
We cannot even print newspapers or books, we cannot even speak to all and for all on matters of the state unless we get permission from the officials who have been put in authority over us without our consent, just as the landlord used to appoint his bailiffs without the consent of the peasants! Just as the peasants used to be the slaves of the landlords, so the Russian people are still the slaves of ithe officials.
Just as the peasants under serfdom were deprived of civil liberty, so the Russian people are still deprived of political liberty.
Polit­ ical liberty means the freedom of the people to settle affairs re­ lating to the people as a whole, to the state.
Political liberty means the right of the people to elect councillors (deputies) to represent them in a State Duma (parliament).
All laws should be discussed and passed, all taxes and dues should be fixed only by such a State Duma (parliament) elected by the whole people.
Political liberty means the right of the people to choose their own officials, to call any meetings they please for the discussion of all the affairs of state, to publish whatever papers and books they please, without having to ask for permission.
All the other European peoples won political liberty for diem­ selves long ago.
Only in Turkey and in Russia are the people still politically the slaves of the sultan’s government and of the government of the autocratic tsar.
The tsar’s autocracy means the unlimited power of the tsar.
The people play no part in the constitution of the state or in the administration of the state.
All the laws are made and all the officials are appointed by the tsar alone, by his personal, unlimited autocratic authority.
But of course the tsar cannot know all the Russian laws or all the Rus­ sian officials.
The tsar cannot know all that goes on in the country.
The tsar simply endorses the will of a few score of the biggest and most important officials.
However much he may want to, one man cannot govern an enormous country like Rus­ sia.
It is not the tsar that governs Russia; to say: autocracy is government by one man.
is merely uttering a phrase.
Russia is governed by a handful of the richest and most highborn officials.
The tsar learns only that which this handful is pleased to tell him.
The tsar is quite powerless to go against the will of this handful of nobles of high rank: the tsar himself is a landlord and one of the nobility; from his earliest childhood he has been surrounded by these highborn people, and only by them; it was they who brought him up and educated him; what he knows of the rest of the Russian people is only what these noble gentry know, what these rich landlords and the few very rich merchants who are received at the tsar’s court know.
In every volost office you will find the same picture hanging on the wall: it depicts the tsar, Alexander HI (the father of the present tsar), speaking to the volost headmen who have come to his coronation.
The tsar is saying to them: “Obey your marsh­ als of the nobility.
” And the present tsar, Nicholas II, has re­ peated these words.
This means that the tsars themselves admit that they can only govern the country with the aid of the no­ bility and through the nobility.
We must firmly remember these words of the tsar’s about the peasants having to obey the gentry.
We must clearly realise that those who depict the tsarist gov­ ernment as the best government are liars.
In other countries— these people say—the government is elected; but it is the rich who are elected, and they govern unjustly and oppress the poor.
In Russia the government is not elected; an autocratic tsar governs the country.
The tsar stands above everyone, above rich and poor.
The tsar, they tell us, is just to everyone, to the poor and rich alike.
Such talk is mere humbug.
Every Russian knows the kind of justice that is dispensed by our government.
Everyone knows whether a plain workingman or a peasant labourer can become a member of the State Council.
* In all other European coun­ tries factory workers and farmhands are members of the State Duma (parliament); and they can freely speak to all the people about the miserable condition of the workers, and call upon the workers to unite and to fight for better conditions.
And no one dare stop these speeches of the people’s representatives, no policeman dare lay a finger on them,** Russia has no representative government, and it is not merely the rich and the highborn who govern her, but the worst of these.
She is governed by those who are best at intriguing at the tsar’s court, who are cleverest at mischief-making, who carry lies and slanders to the tsar, who flatter him and toady to him.
They govern in secret; the people do not know and cannot know what new lawrs are being prepared, what wars are being hatched, what new taxes are being introduced, which officials are being rewarded and for what services, and which are being dismissed.
In no country is there such a multitude of officials as in Russia, the officials tower above the voiceless people like a dense forest—a mere workingman can never make his wray through this forest, can never obtain justice.
No complaint against the brib­ ery, the robbery or the violence of the officials is ever brought to light; every complaint is smothered in official red tape.
The voice of an isolated man can never reach the people, it is lost in the dense thickets, it is stifled in the police torture chamber.
An army of officials, who were never elected by the people and who are not responsible to the people, has woven a thick web, and men and women are struggling in this web like flies.
The tsarist autocracy is an autocracy of officials.
The tsarist autocracy means the feudal dependence of the people upon the officials and especially upon the police.
The tsarist autocracy is police autocracy.
This is why the workers come out into the streets with ban­ ners bearing the inscriptions: “Down with the autocracy!” “Long live political liberty!” This is why the tens of millions of the village poor must support and take up tins battle cry of the urban workers.
Like them, regardless of all persecution, of all the enemy’s threats and violence, and undeterred by the first re­ verses, the agricultural labourers and ithe poor peasants must come forward for a decisive struggle for the freedom of the whole of the Russian people and demand first of all the con­ vocation of the representatives of the people.
Let the people themselves throughout die length and breadth of Russia elect their councillors (deputies).
Let these councillors form a supreme assembly, which will introduce representative govern­ ment in Russia, free the people from serfdom to the officials and the police, secure for the people the right to meet freely, to apeak freely and to have a free press.
This is what the Social-Democrats want first and foremost.
This is the meaning of their first demand, the demand for polit­ ical liberty.
We know that political liberty, free elections to the State Duma (parliament), freedom of meetings, freedom of the press, will not deliver the working people from poverty and oppression at one stroke.
There is no recipe for delivering the poor of town and country at one stroke from the burden of working for the rich.
The working people have no one to place their hopes in and no one to rely upon but themselves.
No one will free the workingman from poverty unless he frees himself.
And to free themselves the workers of die whole country, of the whole of Russia, must unite to form one association, one party.
But mil­ lions of workers cannot unite if the autocraitic police govern­ ment forbids all meetings, all working class newspapers, the election of workers’ delegates.
To unite they must have the right to form any association they please, they must have the right of combination, they must have political liberty.
Political liberty will not deliver the working people from poverty all at once, but it will give the workers a weapon with which t-o fight poverty.
There is no other means and there can be no other means of fighting poverty except the unification of the workers.
But millions of people cannot unite unless there is political liberty.
In all European countries where the people have won political liberty the workers began to unite long ago.
Throughout the whole of Europe, workers who own no land and no workshops, who work for other people for wages all their lives, are called proletarians.
Over fifty years ago the first call was sounded for the working people to unite.
“Proletarians of all countries, unite!” During the past fifty years these words have sounded and resounded all over the world, they are repeated at tens and hundreds of thousands of workers’ meetings, they can be read in millions of Social-Democratic books and papers in every lan­ guage in the world.
Of course, it is no easy task to unite millions of workers in one association, one party—it requires time, persistence, tenacity and courage.
The workers are ground down by poverty, numbed by endless drudgery for the capitalists and landlords, often they have not even the time to think of why they remain eternal paupers or how to be delivered from this.
Everything is done to prevent the workers from uniting: either by means of direct and brutal violence, as in countries like Russia where there is no political liberty, or by refusing to employ workers wfho preach the doctrines of socialism, or by means of deceit and corrup­ tion.
But no violence, no persecution will stop the proletarian workers from fighting for the great cause of the emancipation of all the wwking people from poverty and oppression.
The number of workers who are Social-Democrats is constantly growing.
Take Germany, which is a neighbour of ours; there they have representative government.
Formerly, Germany, too, was an unlimited autocratic monarchy.
But more than fifty years ago the German people destroyed autocracy—and won political liberty by force.
In Germany laws are no longer made by a handful of officials, as they are in Russia; they are made by an assembly elected by the people, by a parliament, by the Reich­ stag.
as the Germans call it.
All adult males take part in elect­ ing deputies to this assembly.
This makes it possible to count how many votes are cast for the Social-Democrats.
In 1887 one­ tenth of all the votes were cast for the Social-Democrats.
In 1898 (the date of the last elections to the Reichstag) the number of Social-Democratic votes was almost three times greater: more than one•fourth of all the votes were cast for the Social-Dem­ ocrats.
Over two million adult males voted for Social-Democratic parliamentary candidates.
Among the farm labourers of Germany socialism is not yet widespread; but it is making very rapid pro­ gress among them.
And when the masses of farmhands, day labour­ ers and poor, pauperised peasants unite with their brothers in the towns, the German workers will win and establish conditions in which there will be neither poverty nor oppression for the toilers.
By wThat means do the Social-Democratic workers intend to deliver the people from poverty? To know how to do this, one must clearly understand the cause of the poverty of the immense masses of the people under the present social order.
Great cities are growing, magnificent stores and houses are being built, railways are being constructed, all kinds of machinery and improvements are being introduced in industry and in agriculture, but millions of people remain destitute, continue to work all their lives to provide a bare liv­ ing for their families.
That is not all: more and more people are becoming unemployed.
Both in town and country there are more and more people who can find no work at all.
In the vil­ lages they starve, in the towns they swell the ranks of the “gold gangs” and “barefoot gangs,”1 they find refuge like beasts in dugouts on the outskirts of the town or in dreadful slums and cellars such as those in the Khitrov Market in Moscow.
Why is this? Wealth and luxury are increasing all the time while the millions and millions who by their labour create all this wealth remain in poverty and destitution! The peasants arc dying of starvation, the workers wander about workless, while traders export millions of poods of corn from Russia to foreign countries, and factories are closed down because the goods can­ not be sold, there is no market for them! 1The nickname given to the “down and outs” the lumpen proletar­ iat—Ed.
Eng.
ed.
The cause o£ all this is, first of all, that most of the land, all the factories, workshops, machinery, buildings, ships, etc.
, be­ long to a small number of rich people.
Tens of millions of people work on this land and in these factories and workshops, but they are all owned by some tens of thousands of rich people, landlords, merchants and manufacturers.
The people work for these rich men for wages, for a crust of bread.
All that is pro­ duced over and above what is required to provide a bare living for the workers goes to the rich owners; it constitutes their pro­ fit, their “income.
” All the benefits arising from the use of machinery and the improvements in the methods of production go to the landlords and the capitalists: they accumulate count­ less riches, while the workers get nothing but a few wretched crumbs.
The workers are brought together to work: as many as several hundred or even several thousand workers may work on a large estate or in a large factory.
When labour is brought together in this wTay and when this is accompanied by the use of machinery, work becomes much more productive; a single worker begins to produce much more than several dozen work­ ers used to produce when working separately and without any machinery.
It is not the toilers, but the big landowners, the mer­ chants and manufacturers—an insignificant number of people— who profit by labour becoming more productive.
One often hears it said that a landlord or a merchant “gives work” to the people or that he “gives” a job to the poor.
It is often said, for instance, that a neighbouring factory or a neigh­ bouring landlord “feeds” the local peasants.
But in reality it is the workers who feed themselves by their labour, and in addi­ tion feed all those who do not wTork.
But in order to obtain permission to work on the landlord’s land, in a factory or on a railway, the worker must give the owner all that he produces, while the worker himself gets only a meagre pittance.
So that in actual fact it is not the landlords and the merchants who give work to the workers, but the workers who maintain everyone by their labour, by surrendering the greater part of the results of their labour for nothing.
Further, in all modern countries the poverty of the people is due to ithe fact that all the articles produced by the workers are produced for sale, for the market.
Whatever the manufacturer and the artisan, the landlord and the well-to-do peasant pro­ duce, the livestock they breed, or the com they sow and gather in, is produced to be sold, to be turned into money.
Money has everywhere become the ruling power.
All the goods produced by the labour of man can be exchanged for money.
Money can even buy men, that is to say, it can force a man who owns noth­ ing to work for another who has money.
In former times, under serfdom, land used to be the ruling power; whoever possessed land possessed power and authority.
Now it is money, capital, that has become the ruling power.
Money will buy all the land you like.
Unless you have money land is of little use to you: for you want money to buy a plough or other implements, to buy livestock, to buy clothes and other goods in the towns, not to speak of paying itaxes.
Because they want money nearly all the landlords mortgage their land to a bank.
To get money the government borrows from the rich men and the bankers of all the world, and pays millions of rubles yearly in interest on these loans.
For the sake of money everyone today is waging a fierce war against everyone else.
Each tries <to buy cheap and to sell dear, each tries to outdo die other, to sell as much of his wares as he can, to underbid the other, to conceal from him a profitable market or a profitable order.
In this general scramble foir money it is the small man, the small artisan, or the small peasant, who fares worst: he is always beaten by the big merchant or the rich peasant.
The small man never has any reserves; he lives from hand <to mouth; the first difficulty, the first accident, compels him to pawn his last belongings or to sell his livestock dirt cheap.
Having fallen into the hands of a kulak or of a money lender, he very rarely succeeds in extricating himself from his clutches: in most cases he is utterly ruined.
Every year tens and hundreds of thousands of small peasants and artisans lock up their cottages, surrender their holdings to the community, and become wage labourers, farmhands, unskilled workers, proletar­ ians.
Meanwhile, in tliis scramble for money, the rich grow richer and richer.
They pile up millions and hundreds of mil­ lions of rubles in the banks; and besides their own money, die money deposited in the banks by others also helps them to be­ come rich.
The small man will deposit a few score or a few hundred rubles in a bank or a savings bank and be paid in­ terest at the rate of three or four kopeks on the ruble; the rich man will make millions out of these scores and hundreds, he will use these millions to enlarge his turnover, and make ten and twenty kopeks on the ruble.
This being the case, the Social-Democratic workers say that the only way to put an end to the poverty of the people is to change the existing order from top to bottom and to intro­ duce a socialist order: in other words, to take the land from the big landowners, the factories from the manufacturers, the money capital from the bankers, to abolish private properly and hand it all over to the toilers of the whole country.
When this is done the rich who live by die labour of others will no longer command .
the labour of the workers; this will be done by the workers themselves and by persons elected by them.
Then the fruits of united labour and the benefits that arise from improvements and machinery will go to all the toilers, all the workers.
Wealth will begin to grow at a still faster rate be­ cause, when ibhey have to work for themselves and not for the capitalists, the workers will work belter, the working day will be shorter, the workers’ standard of living will be higher, all their conditions of life will become completely changed.
But it is not an easy matter to change the existing order in the whole of our country.
This requires a great deal of work and much stubborn fighting.
All the rich, all the propertied people, all the bourgeoisie1 will defend their riches with all their might.
The officials and the army will rise to defend the rich class, because the government itself is in the hands of the 1 Bourgeois means an owner of property.
The bourgeoisie are all the owners of property taken together.
A big bourgeois is the owner of big property.
A petty bourgeois is the owner of small property.
The words bourgeoisie and proletariat mean owners and workers, the rich and the poor, or those who live by the labour of others and those who work for others for wages.
rich class.
The workers must rally as one man for the fight against all those who live by the labour of others; the workers must become united and help to unite all the poor into a single tvorking class, a single class of the proletariat.
The struggle will not be an easy one for the working class, but it is bound to end in the victory of the workers, because the bourgeoisie, the people who live by the labour of others, are an insignificant minority of the population, while the working class is the great majority-Workers against property owners means millions against thousands.
The workers in Russia are already uniting for this struggle in a single Social-Democratic Labour Party.
Difficult as it may be to unite in secret, hiding from the police, nevertheless, the organisation is growing and becoming stronger.
When the Rus­ sian people have won political liberty the work of uniting the working class, the cause of socialism, will march forward much more rapidly, more rapidly dhan among the German workers.

Riches and Poverty.
Owners and Workers in the Countryside We know now what the Social-Democrats want.
They want to fight the rich class to free the people from poverty.
There is quite as much poverty in the country as in the towns, or even more.
We need not speak here about how great the poverty in the country is.
Every worker who has been in the country and every peasant knows quite well how poor, how hungry, cold and impoverished the countryside is.
But the peasant does not know what makes him miserable, hungry and impoverished, or how to rid himself of his poverty.
To know this we must first ascertain what causes want and poverty in town and country.
We have already dealt with this briefly, and we have seen that the poor peasants and the agri­ cultural labourers must unite with the urban workers.
But this is not enough.
We must ascertain what sort of people in the villages will take the side of the rich, of the owners, and what sort of people will take the side of the workers, of the Social-Democrats.
We must ascertain whether there are many peasants besides the landlords who can acquire capital and live by <the labour of others.
Unless we get to the bottom of this matter, no amount of talking about poverty will be of any use, and the rural poor will never be able to understand which people in the villages must unite among themselves and with the urban work­ ers, and what must be done to make the alliance a true one and to prevent the peasant from being cheated by his own kind, the rich peasant, as well as by the landlord.
To ascertain .
this let us enquire how strong die landlords are and how strong the rich peasants are in die country.
Let us begin, with the landlords.
We can judge of their power by the amount of land they own.
The total amount of land in European Russia, including peasant allotment land and privately owned land, was calculated at 240,000,000 dessiatins1 (except the crown lands of which we will speak separately).
Out of this total of 240,000,000 dessiatina, 131,000,000 dessiatina are held by the peasants, that is to say, by over 10,000,000 families; whereas 109,000,000 dessiatina are held by private owners, i.
e.
, by less than half a million families.
So that if we figure out the average, we shall find that every peasant family has 13 dessiatins, while every family of private owners has 218 dessiatins! But as we shall presently see, the land is distributed still more unequally.
Of the 109,000,000 dessiatins owned by private owners seven million are appanage lands, in other words, they are the private property of the members of the imperial family.
The tsar and his family are the first landlords, the biggest landlords, in Rus­ sia.
One family possesses more land than half a million peasant families! Further, the churches and monasteries own about six million dessiatins of land.
Our priests preach frugality and ab­ stinence to the peasants, but they themselves have, by fair means and foul, accumulated an enormous amount of land.
Another two million dessiatins are owned by -the cities and 1 These and all subsequent figures concerning the amount of land are very much out of date.
They refer to the years 1877-78.
But we have no more up-to-date figures.
The Russian government can only survive by liv­ ing in the dark, and that is why complete and truthful information about the life of the people 'in the whole country is so rarely collected in our country.
towns, and about an equal amount by various commercial and industrial companies and corporations.
Ninety-two million dess­ iatina (the exact figure is 91,605,845, but to simplify matters we will quote round figures) belong to less than half a million (481,358) families of private owners.
Half these families are quite small owners, owning less than ten dessiatins of land each, and all of them «together own less than one million dessiatins.
On the other hand, sixteen thousand families own more than one thousand dessiatins each; and the total land owned by them amounts to sixty-five million dessiatins.
What boundless areas of land are concentrated in the hands of the big landowners is seen from the fact that just under one thousand families (924) own more than ten thousand dessiatins each and all -together they own twenty-seven million dessiatins between them! One thousand families own as much land as is owned by two million peasant families.
It is clear that millions and tens of millions of people are bound to live in the greatest distress and starvation, and they will go on starving and living in the greatest distress as long as such boundless areas of land are owned by a few thousand rich families.
It is clear that the state authorities, the government (even a tsar’s government), will always dance to the tune of these big landowners.
It is clear that the rural poor can expect no help from anyone or from any quarter as long as they do not unite as a single class in order to wage a fierce and stubborn fight against the landlord class.
At tliis point we must observe that very many people (includ­ ing many educated people) have a completely mistaken view of the power of the landlord class; they say that the “state” owns still more land.
“Even now,” say these bad counsellors of the peasant, “a large portion of the territory [i.
e.
, of all the land] of Russia belongs to the state.
” (These words are taken from the newspaper Revolyutsionnaya Rossiya^o.
8, p.
8.
) Their mistake arises from the following: they have heard that the state owns 150,000,000 dessiatins of land in European Russia.
That is true.
But they forget that these 150,000,000 dessiatins consist almost entirely of unproductive land and forests in the Far North, in 17 Leoin u the Archangel, Vologda, Olonets, Vyatka and Perm gubernias.
You see that the state has only retained that land which up to the present has been quite unfit for cultivation.
The productive land owned by the stale amounts to less than four million dess­ iatine.
And these productive state lands (for example, in the Samara Gubernia, where they are particularly large) are leased for very low rents, for less than nothing, to the rich.
The rich rent thousands and tens of thousands of dessiatins of these lands and sublet them to the peasants at exorbitant rents.
The people who say that the state owns a great deal of land are very bad counsellors of the peasant.
What is really the case is that the big private owners (including the tsar) own a lot of good land, and the state itself is in the hands of these big own­ ers.
As long as the rural poor do not unite and by uniting thus become a formidable force, the “state” will remain the obedient servant of the landlord class.
There is one more thing we must not forget: formerly, practically all the landlords were nobles.
The nobility still owns an enormous amount of land (in 1877-78, 115,000 nobles owned 73,000,000 dessiaans).
But today money, capital, has become the ruling power.
Merchants and well-to-do peasants have bought very large tracts of land.
It is estimated that in the course of thirty years (from 1863 to 1892) the net loss (i.
e.
, the excess of sales over purchases) of land by the no­ bility amounted to over 600,000,000 rubles.
And merchants and honorary citizens have bought land to the value of 250,000,000 rubles.
Peasants, Cossacks and “other rural inhabitants” (as our government calls the common folk, to distinguish them from the “nobles” and the “clean public”) have bought land to the value of 300,000,000 rubles.
This means that on an average every year the peasants, in the whole of Russia, acquire land in freehold to the value of 10,000,000 rubles.
You see that there are different sorts of peasants: there are the peasants who are poor and starve; and there are those who become rich.
It follows that the number of rich peasants, who want to keep up with the landlords and who will take the side of the rich against the workers, is increasing.
The rural poor who wish to unite with the urban workers must very carefully consider and ascertain how many peasants of this kind there are, how strong they are and the sort of association that is required to fight this force.
We have just mentioned the bad counsellors of the peasant.
These bad counsellors are fond of saying that the peasants have such an association already, namely, the mir, the village community.
The mir9 they say, is a great force.
The mir unites the peasants very closely; the organisation of the peas­ ants in the mir is colossal (i.
e.
, enormous, boundless).
This is wrong.
It is a fairy talc.
A fairy tale invented by kind-hearted people, but a fairy tale nevertheless.
If we listen to fairy tales we shall only wreck our cause, the cause of uniting the rural poor with the urban workers.
Let every rural inhabit­ ant look around attentively: is the mir9 the peasant community, at all like an association of the poor to fight all the rich, all those who live by the labour of others? No, it is not and it can­ not be.
In every village, in every community, there ane many labourers, many pauperised peasants, and by their side there are rich peasants who employ labourers and buy land “in perpetu­ ity.
” These rich peasants are also members of the community and it is they who boss the community because they have all the power.
Is this what we want, an association tire members of which include the rich, and in which the rich are the bosses? Certainly not.
We want an association to fight the rich.
So the mir is no good to us at all.
What we want is a voluntary association, an association of people who have realised that they must unite with the urban workers.
The village community is not a voluntary, but an official association.
The village community does not consist of people who work for the rich and who want to unite to fight the rich.
The village community consists of all sorts of people, not be­ cause they want to be in it, but because their parents lived on the same land and worked for the same landlord, because the authorities have registered them as members of that community.
The poor peasants are not free to leave the community; they are not free to receive a stranger into the community.
We, our association, may require a man in our village, but the police have registered him as belonging to another volost, and so he 17* cannot join.
No, it is a very different kind of association we want; we want a voluntary association consisting of none but workers and poor peasants to fight all those who live by the labour of others.
The times when die mir used to be a force have long passed, never to return.
The mir was a force when hardly any of the peasants were landless labourers or workers wandering over the length and breadth of Russia in search of a job, and when there were hardly any rich peasants, wrhen all were equally ground down by the serfowning landlords.
But now money has become the principal power.
Members of the same community will now fight each other for money like wild beasts.
The moneyed peas­ ants are sometimes even better at bullying and fleecing >their fel­ low peasants than the landlords.
What we want today is not the association of the mir, but an association directed against the power of money, against the rule of capital, an association of all the rural labourers and all the poor peasants of different communities, the unity of all the rural poor with the urban workers to fight the landlords and ithe irich peasants without dis­ tinction.
We have seen the power of the landlords.
We must now try' to ascertain how many rich peasants there are and what their power is.
We measured the power of the landlords by the size of their estates, by the amount of land they own.
The landlords are free to dispose of their land as they please, they are free to buy land and to sell it.
That is why it is possible to judge their power very accurately by the amount of land they own.
The peasants, on the other hand, still lack the right freely to dispose of their land, they are still semi-serfs, tied to their village community.
Hence it is impossible to judge the power of the rich peasants by »the amount of allotment land they hold.
It is not the allot­ ment that makes the rich peasants rich; they also buy a consider­ able amount of land, they buy it “in perpetuity” (i.
e.
, in free­ hold) and “for a number of years” (i.
e.
, on lease), they buy it from the landlords and from their fellow’ peasants, from those peasants who abandon their land, whom necessity forces to lease their holdings.
For these reasons, it is best to distinguish the rich, die middle and the poor peasants according to the number of horses they own.
A peasant who has many horses will nearly always be a rich peasant: if he keeps a lot of draught animals it shows that he cultivates much land and owns land besides his communal allotment, and has money saved up.
Now we are in a position to calculate the number of peasants owning many horses in the whole of Russia (European Russia, not including Siberia or the Caucasus).
Of course it must be borne in mind that we can speak of the whole of Russia only in round figures: the dif­ ferent uyezds and gubernias vary to a considerable degree.
For instance, in the neighbourhood of cities we often find rich peas­ ant farmers who do not keep many horses.
Some of them engage in market gardening—a very profitable business—-others do not keep many horses but keep cows and sell milk.
In all parts of Russia there are also peasants who do not make money out of the land, but engage in trade: they run oil mills, hulling mills and other enterprises.
Anyone who has lived in the country has known rich peasants in his own village or in the district.
But what we have to do is to ascertain how many there are in the whole of Russia, and what powder they possess, so that the poor peasant shall not have to guess and go about blindfolded, as it were, but that he may know to a certainty who his friends and foes are.
Now then, let us see how many peasants there are who are rich and how many who are poor in horses.
We have already said that in tlie whole of Russia there are about 10.
000,000 peas­ ant households.
Between them they own, probably, some 15,000.
000 horses (fourteen years ago or so the number was 17,000,000, but it has become less since).
This means that on an average every ten households had fifteen horses.
But the whole point is that some of them—they are few—owm many horses while others—and they are many—either own no horses, or very few.
There are at least three million horseless peasants, and about three and a half million owning only one horse.
All these peasants are either utterly destitute or very poor.
We call these the rural poor.
They number six and a half million out of a total of ten million, that is to say, almost two-thirds! Next come the middle peasants who own a pair of horses each.
These peas­ ants number about two million households, with about four mil­ lion horses between them.
Then come the rich peasants, each of whom owns more than one pair of horses.
These comprise one and a half million households, but between them they own seven and a half million horses1 This means that about one-sixth of the total number of households own half the total number of horses.
Now that we know this we are in a position to judge fairly accurately the power of the rich peasants.
Their number is not great: according to the different communities and volosts they will muster from ten to twenty households in every hundred.
But these households, although they are few, arc the richest.
Taking Russia as a whole, they own almost as many horses as all the other peasants put together.
This means that the acreage sown by them must also amount to nearly half the total acreage sown by the peasants, and that they gather in much more corn than they require for the needs of their families.
They sell large quantities of corn.
They grow corn not merely to feed themselves, they grow it chiefly to sell and to make money.
Peasants like these can save money.
They deposit it in savings banks and banks.
They buy land in freehold.
We have already seen how much land is bought every year by the peasants; nearly all this land goes to these rich peasants.
The rural poor cannot think of buying land, they have as much as they can do 1 We must repeat that the figures quoted are rough average figures.
The number of rich peasants may not be exactly a million and a half, it may very well be a million and a quarter, or a million and three-quarters, or even two million.
That would not make very much difference.
The essential thing is not to count them up to the last thousand or last hundred thousand, but clearly to realise the strength and the position of the rich peasants so that we may be able to recognise our friends and our enemies, that we may not delude ourselves by stories and empty talk, but ac­ curately calculate the position of the poor and die position of the rich respectively.
Let every rural worker carefully study his own volost and the neigh­ bouring volosts.
He will see that we have counted correctly, and that, on an average, this will be the position everywhere: out of every hundred households there will be ten, at the moat twenty, rich families, some twenty middle peasants, and all the rest—poor.
to keep themselves from starving.
Far from being able to buy land, they often lack money to buy bread.
It follows that the banks, and the Peasants’ Bank* in particular, do not help all the peasants to buy land (as is sometimes asserted by people who try to delude the peasant, and sometimes by people who are a bit too simple-minded), but only an insignificant number of peasants, only the rich peasants.
It follows also that when ihe above-mentioned bad counsellors of the peasant say that the land is being bought by peasants, that the land is passing from capital to labour, it is not true.
Land can never pass to labour, i.
e.
, to the poor workingman, because land has to be paid for.
And the poor never have any spare cash.
The land can only pass to the rich and moneyed peasants, to capital, to those people against whom the rural ipoor must fight in alliance with the urban workers.
The rich peasants not only buy land in perpetuity; they most often take land on lease for a number of years.
They prevent the poor from getting the land by renting large plots of land.
For example, in one uyezd in the Poltava Gubernia, namely Kon-stantinograd, the amount of land rented by the rich peasants has been calculated.
And what do we see? Out of every fifteen households not more than two rented thirty dessiatins or more.
These rich peasants were very* few in number, but they held one-half of all the land rented, and each of them held on an average seventy-five dessiatins of rented land! Or take the Tau­ rida 'Gubernia, where a calculation was made of how much of the land, which the peasants leased from the stale through the mir, through the village community, has been grabbed by the rich.
It turned out that the rich, who form only one-fifth of the total number of households, have grabbed three-fourths of the rented land.
Everywhere land is divided according to money, and it is only the rich, who are very few, that have the money.
Further, much land is leased out by the peasants themselves.
The peasants abandon their holdings because they have no live­ stock.
no seeds, nothing to keep their farms going with.
Today even land is of no use unless you have money.
For instance, in the Novouzensk Uyezd in the Samara Gubernia, one, even two, out of eve^ three rich peasant households rent allotment land in their own or in a neighbouring community.
The peasants who lease out their communal allotments are those who have no horses or only one horse.
In the Taurida Gubernia as much a* one-third of the peasant households lease out allotments.
A quarter of a million dessiatins.
in other words, one-fourth of the total acreage under peasant communal allotments, is leased out.
Of this quarter of a million dessiatins, one hundred and fifty thousand dessiatins (three-fifths) is rented by the rich peasants! This too enables us to judge whether the mir, the community, is the sort of association that suits the poor.
In the village commun­ ity, he who has money has power.
But what we want is an as­ sociation of the poor of all communities.
All this talk about buying land is only intended to deceive the peasant, and the same is true of the talk about helping the peasant to buy cheap ploughs, harvesters and all sorts of im­ proved machinery.
Zemstvo stores and co-operatives are set up.
and the peasant is told that improved equipment will improve his conditions.
This is all a fraud.
All this improved equipment always goes to the rich; the poor get next to nothing.
They can­ not afford to think of ploughs and harvesters when they have to think of how to keep body and soul together! All this sort of ‘‘helping the peasants” is nothing but helping the rich.
Of what use will it be to the mass of the poor who have neither land, nor livestock, nor reserves, even if the best equipment becomes cheaper.
Here is an example.
In one of the districts of the.
Sa­ mara Gubernia all the improved equipment belonging to the poor and to the rich peasants was counted, and it was discovered that one-fifth of all the households, i.
e.
, the most well-to-do, owned almost three-fourths of the improved equipment, while the poor—half the households—had only one-thirtieth of it Out of a ‘total of 28,000 households, 10,000 were horseless and one-horse peasants; these 10.
000 had only seven improved imple­ ments out of a total of 5.
724 improved implements owned by all the peasant households in the district Seven out of 5,724—that is the share the rural poor receive of all these economic im­ provements, of al! this increase in the number of ploughs and harvesters which are supposed to help “all the peasantry”! This is what the rural poor must expect from the people who speak of “improving peasant fanning.
” Finally, one of the main features of the rich peasants is that they hire farmhands and day labourers.
Like the landlords, the rich peasants also live by the labour of others.
Like the land­ lords they grow rich because the mass of the peasants are ruined and pauperised.
Like the landlords they try to squeeze as much work as they can out of their farmhands, and pay them as little as possible.
If there were not millions of utterly ruined peasants who are compelled to work for others, compelled to become hired labourers, to sell their labour power—the rich peasants would never be able to exist or to carry on with their farms.
There would be no “decayed” allotments for them to pick up, no labourers for them to hire.
And in the whole of Russia the million and a half rich peasants certainly hire no less than one million farmhands and day labourers.
It is clear that in the great fight between the propertied class and the propertyless, between masters and workers, between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, the rich peasants will take the side of the property owners against the working class.
Now we know the position and the power of the rich peas­ antry.
Let us examine the condition of the rural poor.
We have said that the rural poor comprise the great majority, almost two-thirds of the peasant households of Russia.
To begin with, the number of horseless households cannot be less than three million—probably more than that today, perhaps three and a half million.
Every famine, every failure of the crops ruins tens of thousands of households.
The population grows, the land becomes more congested, but all the best land has been grabbed by the landlords and rich peasants.
Every year more and more people are ruined, they go to the towns and fac­ tories.
they seek employment as farmhands, or become un­ skilled labourers.
A horseless peasant is a peasant who has become quite propertyless.
He is a proletarian.
He lives (lives! it would be truer to say that he does not live but just contrives to keep body and soul together) not by the land, not by hb farm, but by working for wages.
He is the brother of the town worker.
Even land is of no use to the horseless peasant: half the horseless peasants lease out their allotments because they are not in a condition to till the land, others surrender them to the community gratis (and sometimes they even have to pay to be allowed to do so!).
A horseless peasant sows one dessiatin, or two at the very most.
He always has to buy bread part of the year (if he has money to buy it with)—his own crop is never sufficient.
The one-horse peasants are not very much better off—and there are three and a half million of them in Russia.
Of course, there are exceptions, and we have pointed out that here and there, there are one-horse peasants who are doing middling well, or are even rich.
But we are not concerned with exceptions or with any one particular uyezd, but with Russia as a whole.
If we take the one-horse peasants as a whole, there can be no doubt that they represent a mass of paupers; even in the agricultural provinces the one-horse peasant sows only three or four dessiatina, rarely as many as five; and his own crop never lasts him the whole year.
Even in a favourable year his food is no better than that of a horseless peasant—which means that he is constantly underfed, constantly hungry.
His farm is in decay, his livestock are poor and short of fodder, he is not in a condition to till his land properly.
The sum which a one-horse peasant in the Voronezh Gubernia, for example, is able to spend on his farm (excluding fodder) is not more than twenty rubles a year.
(A rich peasant spends ten times that sum.
) Twenty rubles a year for renting land, for buying livestock, for repair­ ing his wooden plough and other implements, for paying the shepherd, and for everything else! Do you call this farming? It is nothing but misery, nothing but drudgery, nothing but eternal worry.
Il is natural that some of the one-horse peasants, and not a few, should lease out their allotments as well.
Even land is of little use to a pauper.
He has no money and his land does not even provide him wnth enough to eat.
let alone with money.
But money is wanted for everything: for food and for clothes, for the farm, and to pay taxes.
In the Voronezh Gu­ bernia, a one-horse peasant, as a rule, has to pay about eighteen rubles a year in taxes alone, whereas he cannot make more than seventy-five rubles a year to meet all his expenses.
In these cir­ cumstances it would be pure mockery to suggest that he should buy more land, or to talk to him about improved equipment or about agricultural banks: these things were never invented for the poor.
Where is the peasant to get the money from? He has to look for a “job.
” A one-horse peasant, like a horseless one, keeps himself aliive only with the help of a “job.
” But what does this word “job” mean? It means working for others, working for wages.
It means that the one-horse peasant has half ceased to be an independent farmer anti has become a hireling, a proletar­ ian.
That is why such peasants are described as semi-proletar inns.
They, too, are the brothers of the town workers because they, too, are fleeced in every way by the employers.
They, too, have no way out, no salvation, except by uniting with the Social-Democrats to fight all the rich, all the property owners.
Who works on the building of railways? Who is fleeced by the con­ tractors? Who goes out lumbering and timber floating? Who works as a farmhand? Or as a day labourer? Who does the un­ skilled work in the towns and ports? It is always the tural poor, the horseless and one-horse peasants.
It is always the rural proletarians and semi-proletarians.
And what vast numbers of these there are in Russia! It has been calculated that in Russia (not including the Caucasus and Siberia) eight and sometimes even nine million passports are taken out yearly.
These are all for migratory workers.
They are peasants only in name; in reality they are hirelings, wage labourers.
They must all unite with the town workers—and every ray of light and knowledge that reaches the countryside will strengthen and con­ solidate this unity.
There is one more point about “jobs” that must not be for­ gotten.
Officials, and all sorts of people who think like officials, are fond of talking about the peasant, the poor muzhik, “need­ ing” two things: land (but not too much of it—there cannot be very much of it, because the rich have grabbed it all) and a “job.
” And they say that, in order to help the people, efforts should be made to start as many trades as possible in the country and to “provide” more “jobs.
” Such talk is sheer hypocrisy.
“Jobs” for the poor means wage labour.
“Providing jobs” for the peasants means transforming them into wage-labourers.
Fine sort of assistance this! For the rich peasants there are very different sorts of “jobs,” which demand capital, such as the building of a flour mill or-some other plant, the purchase of threshing machines, commerce and so on.
To confuse these jobs of the moneyed people with the wage labour of the poor is to deceive the poor.
Of course, it is to the advantage of the rich to deceive the poor in this way, it is to their advantage to pre­ tend that every peasant can take up any kind of “job” and has the capital for it.
But he who really cares for the welfare of the poor will tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
It remains for us to consider the middle peasants.
We have seen that, on the average, taking Russia as a whole, we must consider a middle peasant to be one who has a pair of horses, and that out of a total of ten million households there are roughly two million middle peasant households in the country.
The middle peasant stands halfway between the rich peasant and the proletarian, and that is why he is called middle peasant.
His standard of living, too, is middling: when the crop is good he makes ends meet, but poverty is always knocking at the door.
He has either very little savings or none at all.
So his farm is in a rather precarious position.
He finds it hard to get money: only seldom can he make money out of his farm, and when he does, it is barely enough to make ends meet.
To go out for a job would mean letting the farm take care of itself and every­ thing would go to rack and ruin.
In spile of this, many of the middle peasants are often forced to look for a job: they too have become hired labourers, necessity forces them to sell them­ selves to the landlord, to contract debts.
And once in debt the middle peasant is hardly ever able to get out of it, for unlike the rich peasant he has no steady income.
Once he gets into debt it is as if he had put his neck in a halter.
He remains a debtor until he is utterly ruined.
It is chiefly the middle peasant who falls into bondage to the landlord, because for piecework the landlord must have a peasant who is not quite ruined, a peasant who has a pair of horses and all that is needed for fanning.
It is not so easy for the middle peasant to go away to look for a job—so he sells himself into bondage to the landlord in return for corn, in return for pasture and for the lease of “otrezk?' 1 and for advances in cash in the winter.
Besides the landlord and the money lender, the middle peasant is hard pressed by his rich neighbour, who always snatches the land from under his nose and never misses an opportunity to bully him in some way or other.
And this is the life the middle peas­ ant leads; he is neither fish nor fowl.
He can become neither a real farmer nor a wage labourer.
All the middle peasants try to keep up with the masters and want to become proprietors, but only very very few succeed in doing so.
There are a few who try to make money out of the labour of others and to ride to wealth on another’s back by employing farmhands or day labourers.
But the majority of the middle peasants have not the money to hire others—rather have they to hire themselves out.
Whenever a struggle begins between the rich and the poor, between the property owners and the workers, the middle peas­ ant remains in between, not knowing which side to take.
The rich invite him to join them: you are a fanner, they say to him, a man of property, you have nothing to do with the penniless worker.
But the workers say: the rich will cheat you and swindle you, and there is no way out for you but to help us in our flight against all the rich.
This fight for the middle peasant is going on every where, in all countries, wherever the Social-Democratic workers are fighting to emancipate the working people.
In Russia the fight is just beginning.
That is why we must carefully study the matter and understand clearly the deceits the rich resort to in order to win over the middle peas­ ant, we must learn how to expose these deceits and help the middle peasant to find his real friends.
If the Russian Social-1 Literally “cut off” land.
When the serfs were emancipated in 1861 the best parts of their holdings were cut off and taken by the landlords.
Later the landlords leased these lands to the peasants at exorbitant rents which were often paid in the form of labour.

Democratic workers find the right course immediately, it will be much easier for us than it has been for our comrades, the German workers, to establish a lasting alliance between the rural workers and the urban workers, and achieve a speedy victory over all the enemies of the toilers.
4.
Where Should the Middle Peasant Go? Should He Take the Side of the Property Owners and of the Rich, or the Side of the Workers and of the Poor? The property owners, the bourgeoisie, try to draw the middle peasant to their side by promising him all sorts of measures for economic improvement (cheap ploughs, agricultural banks, the introduction of grass sowing, the cheap sale of livestock and fertilizers, and so on) and also by inducing the peasant to join all sorts of agricultural societies (co-operative societies, as they are called in books) which unite all farmers with the object of improving the methods of farming.
In doing so the bour­ geoisie tries to draw the middle and even the small peasant, even the semi-proletarian, away from an alliance with the work­ ers, and tries to prevail on them to side with the rich, with the bourgeoisie, in the fight against the workers, against the pro­ letariat.
To this the Social-Democratic workers reply: improved farm­ ing is an excellent thing.
There is nothing wrong in buying ploughs more cheaply; nowadays even a merchant, if he is not a fool, tries to sell cheap to attract more customers.
But when a poor or a middle peasant is told that improved farming and cheaper ploughs will help all of them to rid themselves of poverty and to stand on their feet, and dial this can be done without touching the rich—it is deceiving them.
All these im­ provements, lower prices and co-operatives (societies for the sale and purchase of goods) will profit the rich to a much greater degree.
The rich grow more powerful and oppress the poor and middle peasants more and more.
As long as the rich remain rich, as long as they own most of the land, of the live­ stock, of the equipment and of the money—as long as all this lasts, neither the poor, nor even the middle peasants will ever be able to escape want Here and there a middle peasant may be able to become rich with the help of all these improvements and co-operative societies, but the people and the middle peas­ ants as a whole will sink deeper and deeper into poverty.
In order that all the middle peasants may become rich, the rich must be turned out, and the only way to turn them out is to form an alliance between the urban workers and the rural poor.
The bourgeoisie say to the middle (and even to the small) peasant: we will sell you land at a low price, and ploughs at a low price, but in return you sell us your soul, give up fighting the rich.
The Social-Democratic worker says: if you are really offered goods at a low price, buy them by all means, if you have the money; that is sound business.
But never sell your soul.
To undertake not to fight the bourgeoisie in alliance with the urban workers would mean remaining a pauper and in want forever.
If goods become cheaper, the rich will make more money and only become richer.
But when you have no money, goods may become dirt cheap, but they will be of no use unless you take that money from the bourgeoisie.
Let us lake an example.
Those who support the bourgeoisie make much ado about all these co-operatives (societies for buy­ ing cheap and selling at a profit).
There are even people, who call themselves “Socialist-Revolutionaries,” who imitate the bour­ geoisie and talk large about the peasant wanting nothing so much as co-operatives, and begin to organise all sorts of co­ operative societies in Russia.
But there are very fewr co-operative societies in Russia, and there will not be many until we have political liberty.
But take Germany: there the peasants have many co-operative societies.
But who profits most by these co­ operative societies? One hundred and forty thousand farmers in the whole of Germany are members of societies for the sale of milk and dairy produce, and these 140,000 fanners (we use round figures for the sake of simplicity) have 1,100,000 cows.
There are four million poor peasants in Germany.
Only 40,000 of these are members of these societies: it follows that only one out of every hundred poor peasants has the benefit of these co-operative societies.
These 40,000 poor peasants own only 100,000 cow's.
The number of middle farmers, middle peasants in the country—is one inillion^ of these 50,000 are members of co-operative societies (in other words, five out of every hun­ dred) and they own 200,000 cows.
Finally, die rich farmers (in­ cluding both landlords and rich peasants) number one-third of a miltion; of these 50,000 are members of co-operative societies (that is to say, seventeen in every hundred!) and they owTn 300,000 cows! You see who it is the co-operative societies help first and fore-moat.
You see the way the peasant is hoodwinked by those people who make a lot of noise about saving the middle peasant by forming societies for buying cheap and selling at a profit.
Really, the bourgeoisie wants to pay too low a price for “buying off” the peasant from the Social-Democrats who invite both the poor and the middle peasant to join them.
In our country, too, co-operative creameries and amalgamated dairies are beginning to be formed.
In our country, loo, there are plenty of people who shout: artels and the mir and co­ operatives—these are what the peasant wants.
But see who pro­ fits by these artels and co-operatives and by communal lease­ holding.
Out of every hundred households, at least twenty have no cows at all; thirty have only one cow each; these only sell milk from dire necessity—their own children have to go with­ out milk, starve and die like flics.
The rich peasants, however, have three or four cows and more each, and these rich peasants own half the total number of cows owned by the peasants.
Who is it, then, that profits by co-operative creameries? Plainly, in the first place it is the landlords and the peasant bourgeoisie.
Plainly, it is to their advantage to induce the middle peasants and the poor to strive to keep up with them and to make them believe that individual small farmers may extricate themselves from poverty by climbing out of their social position and join­ ing the rich, and not by all the workers uniting to fight all the bourgeoisie.
The champions of the bourgeoisie, who pretend to be the champions and friends of the small peasant, approve of these efforts and encourage them by every means.
And many simple-minded people fail to see the wolf in sheep's clothing and be­ lieve dial they are helping the poor and middle peasants when they repeat this bourgeois humbug.
For instance, they write books and deliver lectures in which they try to make it appear that small farms are the most profitable, that they bring the highest incomes, that small farms prosper; that is why, they say, there are so many small farmers everywhere, and why they cling to the land so fiercely (and not because all the best lands are owned by the bourgeoisie, and all the money too, while die poor have to live all their lives penned up on little patches of land!).
The small peasant does not require much money, say these smoodi-tongued people; the small and the middle peasants are more thrifty and more industrious than the big farmers, and know how to live a simple life; instead of buying hay for their horses, they are content to feed them on straw.
Instead of buy­ ing an expensive machine they get up earlier and toil longer and do as much as a machine does; instead of paying money to strangers for doing repairs, the peasant himself takes his hatchet on a Sunday and works a bit as a carpenter—and this is much cheaper than the way a big farmer would do the thing; instead of feeding an expensive horse or an ox, he uses his cow for ploughing; in Germany all the poor peasants plough with a cow, and in our country, too, the people have become so impover­ ished that they are beginning to plough not only with cows, but with men and women! How profitable, how cheap all this is! How praiseworthy of the middle and small peasants to be so industrious, so diligent, to live such simple lives, not to waste their time on nonsense, not to think of socialism, but only of their farms, to take the rich man as their model and not the workers who organise strikes against the bourgeoisie, to become respectable! If only all wTere so industrious and so diligent, and lived frugally, and did not drink, and saved more money, and spent less on calico, and had fewer children—all w’ould be happy and there would be no poverty and no want! These are the sweet songs the bourgeoisie sing for the benefit of the middle peasant, and there are simpletons who believe 18 Lenin 11 these songs and repeat them.
1 In reality, all this honeyed talk is nothing hut deceit and mockery of die peasant.
What these smooth-tongued people call cheap and profitable farming is the want, the dire necessity, which forces the middle and small peas­ ant to work from morning till night, to begrudge himself a bit of bread, to grudge every penny he spends.
Very “cheap” and “pro­ fitable,” no doubt, to wear the same pants for three years, to go about barefooted in the summer, to repair one’s wooden plough with a bit of string and to feed one’s cow on rotten straw from the roof! Put a bourgeois or a rich peasant on such a ‘"cheap” and “profitable” farm, and he will soon forget all this honeyed talk! Often the people who extol small farming want to help the peasant, but in reality they only do him harm.
With their smooth talk they deceive the peasant in the same way as he is deceived by a lottery.
I shall tell you the sort of thing a lottery is.
Let us suppose I have a cow, worth 50 rubles.
I want to turn the cow into money, so I offer everyone tickets at a ruble each.
Everyone has a chance of getting the cow for one ruble! Folks are gullible, rubles pour in.
When I have collected a hundred rubles I proceed to draw the lottery: the one whose ticket is drawn gets the cowt for a ruble, the others get nothing.
Was the cow “cheap” for the people? No, it cost them very dear, be­ cause the total money they paid was double the value of the cow’, because two persons (the one who ran the lottery and the one who won the cow) made money without doing any wrork, and made it at the expense of the ninety-nine people who lost their money.
It follows that those who say that lotteries are ad­ vantageous for the people are simply deceiving the people.
All those who promise to deliver the peasants from poverty and mis­ ery by means of co-operatives (societies for buying cheap and 1 In Russia these simpletons who wish the peasant well, but who every now and then start this sort of honeyed talk, are called “Narodniki” or the “champions of small farms.
” The “Socialist-Revolutionaries,” for lack of understanding, follow in their footsteps.
In Germany also there are many smooth-tongued people.
One of them.
Eduard David, has just writ­ ten a big book, in which he says that small farms are infinitely more pro­ fitable than large ones, because the small peasant does not spend money needlessly, keeps no horses for ploughing, and is content to use his milch cow for ploughing.
selling at a profit), improved farming, banks and all that sort of thing, are deceiving them in exactly the same way.
As at the lottery where there is one winner, and all the rest are losers, so it is with these things: one middle peasant may be clever enough to get rich, but ninety-nine of his fellow peasants bend their backs all their lives, never rid themselves of want, and even become more impoverished.
Let every villager examine his community and the whole district a little more closely: how many middle peasants are there who become rich and forget want? And how many are there who can never rid themselves of it? How many are ruined and are compelled to leave their village? As you have seen, in the whole of Russia there are not more than two million middle peasant households.
Suppose there were ten times as many societies of all kinds for buying cheap and selling at a profit as there are now.
What would the result be? It would be a lot if 100,000 middle peasants succeeded in raising themselves to the level of the rich.
What would that mean? It would mean that out of every hundred middle peas­ ants, five would have become rich.
But what about the other ninety-five? They would be in the same straits as ever, and many of them would be in even greater difficulties! And the poor would only be ruined all the more! The very thing the bourgeoisie wants, of course, is for as many middle and poor peasants as possible to try to keep up with the rich, to believe it possible to abolish poverty without fighting the bourgeoisie, to place their hopes in diligence and frugality and in becoming rich, and not in uniting with the rural and urban workers.
The bourgeoisie does all it can to foster this deceptive faith and hope in the peasant and tries to lull him with smooth talk.
To expose these smooth-tongued people as frauds, it is suffi­ cient to ask them three questions.
The first question: can the working people rid themselves of want and misery as long as 100,000,000 dessiatins out of 240,000,000 dessiatins of productive land in Russia are owned by private landowners, or as long as 16,000 very large land­ owners own 65,000,000 dessiatins? Its* The second question: can the working people rid themselves of want and misery as long as one and a half million rich peas­ ant families (out of a total of ten million) have appropriated half the acreage under peasant crops, half the number of horses and livestock owned by the peasants, and much more than half the peasant stocks and savings; as long as the peasant bour­ geoisie continue to enrich themselves by oppressing the poor and middle peasants, and by making money out of the labour of others, of the farmhands and day labourers; as long as six and a half million peasant households are ruined, poor, always starving, and reduced to winning their miserable crust of bread by all kinds of wage labour? The third question: can the working people rid themselves of want and misery, now that money has become the principal power, now that everything can be bought for money—factories and land, and even men and women can be bought to serve as wage-labourers, as wage-slaves? Now that no one can live or run a farm without money? When a small farmer, a poor peas­ ant, has to wage a struggle against the big farmer over money? When a few thousand landlords, merchants, manufacturers and bankers have appropriated hundreds of millions of rubles, and in addition control all the banks, where thousands of millions of rubles are deposited? No smooth talk about the advantages of small farms or of co-operatives will allow you to evade these questions.
To these questions there can be only one answer: the real “co-operation” that can save the working people is the union of the rural poor with the Social-Democratic workers in the towns to fight the whole of the bourgeoisie.
The faster this union grows and be­ comes strong, the sooner will the middle peasant realise that the promises of the bourgeoisie are all lies, and the sooner will the middle peasant join our side.
The bourgeoisie know this, and that is why, besides smooth talk, they spread all sorts of falsehoods about the Social-Demo­ crats.
They say that the Social-Democrats want to deprive the middle and poor peasants of their property.
This is a lie.
The Social-Democrats want to deprive only the big proprietors, only those who live by the labour of others, of their property.
The Social-Democrats will never take away the property of the small and middle farmers who do not employ labourers.
The Social-Democrats defend and champion the interests of all the toilers, not only the interests of the urban workers, who are more class conscious and more united than the others, but of the agricultur­ al workers as well, and of the small artisans and of the peas­ ants, in so far as these do not employ labour, do not try to imitate the rich and do not lake the side of the bourgeoisie.
The So ci al-Democrats fight for all improvements in the condi­ tions of the workers and peasants which can be introduced im­ mediately, even before we have destroyed the bourgeoisie, and which will help them in the fight against the bourgeoisie.
But the Social-Democrats do not want to mislead the peasant, they tell him the whole truth, they warn him straightforwardly that as long as the bourgeoisie is in power no improvements will rid the people of want and misery.
In order that all the people may know what the Social-Democrats are and what they stand for, the Social-Democrats have drawn up a programme.
A pro­ gramme means a brief, plain and precise statement of all the things the Party is trying to obtain and is fighting for.
The Social-Democratic Party is the only party that advances a plain and precise programme in order that all the people may know and see it, and that the Party may consist only of people who really intend to fight for the emancipation of all the toilers from the yoke of the bourgeoisie, and who understand who must unite for this fight and how the fight must be conducted.
Besides, the Social-Democrats believe that they must explain in their pro­ gramme, in a straightforward, open and precise way, the causes of the poverty and distress of the toilers and why the unity of the workers is becoming wider and stronger.
It is not enough to say that life is hard, and to call for revolt; every shouter can do that, but that is of no use.
The toilers must understand why they are living in such misery and with whom they must unite in order to fight to abolish poverty.
We have stated what the Social-Democrats want, we have ex­ plained the causes of the poverty and distress of the toilers; we have indicated whom the irural poor must fight and with whom they must unite for this fight.
We shall now explain what improvements in the conditions of the workers and the peasants can be won immediately if we fight for them.
5.
What Improvements Do the Social-Democrats Try to Obtain for the Whole People and for the Workers? The Social-Democrats fight for the liberation of all the toilers from robbery, oppression and injustice.
To become free the working class must first of all become united.
And to become united it must have freedom to unite, it must have the right to unite, it must have political liberty.
We have said that autocratic government means making £he people the serfs of the officials and of the police.
Political liberty is therefore needed by the whole of the people, except a handful of courtiers and a few moneybags and high dignitaries who are received at court.
But it is the workers and the peasants who most of all need political liberty.
The rich can purchase freedom for themselves from the tyranny and caprices of the officials and of the police.
The rich can make their complaints hoard in the highest places.
And this being so, the police and the officials take less liberties with the rich than with the poor.
The workers and the peasants have no money with which to bribe the police or the officials, they have no one to complain to, they are not in a position to sue them in court.
The workers and the peasants will never rid themselves of the extortions, the whims or the insults of the police and the officials as long as there is no representative gov­ ernment, as long as there is no national assembly of deputies.
It is only such a national assembly of deputies that can free the people from serfdom to the officials.
Every intelligent peas­ ant must stand for the Social-Democrats, who first and foremost demand of the tsarist government that a national assembly of deputies be convened.
The deputies must be elected by all, ir­ respective of “estate,” irrespective of wealth and poverty.
The elections must be free, without any interference on the part of the officials; they must be carried out under the supervision of the people’s delegates and not of police officers or of Zemsky Nachalniks.
Under such conditions, the representatives of die people will be able to discuss all the needs of the people, and introduce a better state of affairs in Russia.
The Social-Democrats demand that the police be deprived of the power to imprison anyone without trial.
The officials must be severely punished for arbitrarily arresting anyone.
To prevent them from violating the law, the officials must be chosen by the people, and everyone must have the right to sue any official be­ fore a court without first having to ask for permission.
What is the use of complaining about the police to the Zemsky Nachal­ nik, or about the Zemsky Nachalnik to the governor? Of course, the Zemsky Nachalnik will always protect the police with his authority, and the governor will always protect the Zemsky Nachalnik, and the plaintiff runs a fair chance of being punished himself, of being put into prison or deported to Siberia.
Only when everyone in Russia (as has long been the case in oilier countries) has the right to complain to the national assembly, to the elected courts, and io speak freely of his needs, to write about them in the newspapers—only then will the officials feel that they have someone to be afraid of.
The Russian people arc still the serfs of the officials.
Without the permission of the officials the people cannot call meetings, they cannot print books or newspapers! Is this not serfdom? If meetings cannot be freely called, or books freely printed, how can one obtain redress against the officials or against the rich? Of course, the officials suppress every book and every utterance that tells the tru’.
li about the people’s poverty.
The present book, too, has to be printed by the Social-Democratic Party secretly and circulated secretly: anyone who is found in possession of this book will see no end of courts and prisons.
But the Social-Democratic workers are not afraid of this: they print more and more, and give the people more and more truth­ ful books to read.
And no prisons, no persecution can stop the fight for the people’s liberty! The Social-Democrats demand that all distinction between estates be abolished, and that all the citizens of the state have exactly the same rights.
Today we have tax-paying and non-tax­ paying “estates,” privileged and non-privileged “estates,” blue blood and common blood; even the birch has been retained for the common people.
In no country are the workers and peasants in such a position of inferiority.
In no country, except Russia, are there different laws for different “estates.
” It is time the Russian people, too, demanded that every peasant possess all the rights that are possessed by the nobility.
Is it not a disgrace that the birch should still be used and a poll tax-paying estate be in existence more than forty years after the abolition of serfdom? The Social-Democrats demand that the people have complete freedom to move from place to place and to choose their occu­ pations.
What does this mean, this freedom to move from place to place? It means that the peasant roust be free to go where he pleases, to move wherever he wants to, to choose for himself the village or the town he prefers, without having to ask for permission.
It means that passports must be abolished in Russia too (in foreign countries passports were abolished long ago), that no police officer, no Zemsky Nachalnik must be allowed to stop any peasant from settling down or working wherever he pleases.
The Russian peasant is still the serf of the officials to such an extent that he is not free to move to a town, or free to settle in a new district.
The Minister issues orders that the gov­ ernors should not allow unauthorised settlement! The governor knows better than the peasant what place is good for the peas­ ant! The peasant is a child who dares not move without auth­ ority! Is this not serfdom, I ask you? Is it not an insult to the people when every tinpot profligate nobleman is allowed to order grown-up farmers about? There is a book called The Failure of the Crops and the Dis­ tress of the People (the famine), written by the present “Min­ ister of Agriculture,” Mr.
Yermolov.
This book says in so many words: the peasant must not migrate, as long as their worships the landlords want hands.
The Minister speaks quite openly, does not hesitate a bit, he thinks die peasant will not hear what he is saying, will not understand.
Why allow the people to go away when the landlords need cheap labour? The more the people are crowded on the land, the better for the landlords; the poorer the peasants are the more cheaply can they be hired and the more meekly will they submit to bullying of every kind.
In olden times it was the bailiffs who looked after the land­ lord’s interests, now it is the Zemsky Nachalniks and the gov­ ernors.
In olden times it was the bailiffs who ordered the flog­ ging of peasants in the stables, now it is the Zemsky Nachalniks who order the flogging in the volost office.
The Social-Democrats demand that the standing army be abol­ ished, and that a militia be established in its stead, that al) the people be armed.
A standing army is an army that is divorced from the people and trained to shoot down the people.
If the soldier wore not locked up for years in barracks and inhumanly drilled there, would he ever agree to shoot at his brothers, the workers and the peasants? Would he go against the starving peasants? A standing army is not in the least necessary to pro­ tect the country from an attack of the enemy; a people’s militia is sufficient.
If every citizen is armed, Russia need fear no enemy.
And the people would be delivered from the burden of militar­ ism: militarism costs hundreds of millions of rubles a year, and all this money is collected from the people; that is why the taxes are so heavy and why it becomes increasingly difficult to live.
Militarism further increases the power of the officials and of the police over the people.
Militarism is required to plunder foreign peoples, as for instance, to take the land from the Chinese.
The people gain nothing by this, and their burden only increases because of the increased taxes.
The substitution of the armed nation for a standing army would enormously lighten the burden of all the workers and all the peasants.
Similarly, the abolition of indirect taxation, which the Social.
Democrats demand, would be an enormous relief.
Indirect taxes are those taxes which are not assessed on a definite piece of land or farm, but are paid by the people indirectly, by paying a higher price for whal they buy.
The Treasury places a tax on sugar, on spirits, on kerosene, on matches, and all sorts of articles of consumption; the tax is paid to the Treasury by the merchant or by the manufacturer, but, of course, he does not pay it out of his own pocket, but out of the money his customers pay him.
The price of spirits, of sugar, of kerosene, of matches, is increased, so that every purchaser of a bottle of spirits or of a pound of sugar has to pay the tax in addition to the price of the goods.
Out of the fourteen kopeks you pay for a pound of sugar, let us say, about four kopeks constitutes the tax: the sugar manufacturer has already paid the lax to the Treasury and is now exacting the sum he has paid from every one of his customers.
You see that indirect taxes are taxes on articles of consumption, taxes which are paid by the consumer paying a higher price for the article he buys.
It is sometimes said that indirect taxes are the fairest taxes: you pay in the measure in which you buy.
But this is not so.
Indirect taxes are the most unfair of al! taxes, because they are harder for the poor to pay than for the rich.
The rich man’s income is ten times or maybe a hundred times as large as the peasant’s or the workers.
But does the rich man require a hundred times as much sugar? Or ten times as much spirits or matches or kerosene? Of course not! At the very most, a rich family will buy three times as much kerosene or spirits or sugar as a poor family.
And this means that the rich man will pay a smaller part of his income than the poor man.
Let us suppose that the poor peasant’s income is two hundred rubles a year; let us suppose he buys sixty rubles’ worth of such goods as are taxed and which arc consequently dearer (the duty imposed on sugar, matches, kerosene, is an ex­ cise duty, i.
e.
, the manufacturer pays the duty before placing the goods on the market; in the case of spirits, which are manu­ factured by the state, the Treasury simply fixes a higher price; cotton goods, iron and other goods have risen in price because cheap foreign goods are not admitted into Russia unless a heavy duty is paid on them).
Of these sixty rubles twenty rubles con­ stitutes the tax.
This means that out of every ruble of his income the poor peasant has to pay ten kopeks in indirect taxes (not counting direct taxes, land compensation payments, quit rent, land tax, Zemstvo, volost and village rates).
The rich peasant has an income of one thousand rubles; he will buy one hundred and fifty rubles’ worth of taxed goods and pay fifty rubles in taxes (included in these one hundred and fifty rubles).
This means that out of every ruble of his income the rich peasant pays only jive kopeks in indirect taxes.
The richer the man the smaller the share of his income does he pay in indirect taxes.
t This makes indirect taxation the most unfair form of taxation.
Indirect taxes are taxes on the poor.
The peasants and the workers together form nine-tenths of the population and pay eight or nine-tenths of the indirect taxes.
And, in all probability, the income ot the peasants and workers constitutes not more than four-tenths of the whole national income! So the Social-Democrats demand the abolition of indirect taxation and the introduction of a graduated tax on incomes and inheritances.
“Graduated” means that the higher the income, the higher the tax.
Those who have an income of a thousand rubles must pay one kopek to the ruble; if the income is two thousand, two kopeks to the tuble must be paid, and so on.
The smallest incomes (let us say in­ comes of under four hundred rubles) do not pay anything at all.
The richest pay the highest taxes.
Such a lax, an income tax, or more exactly a graduated income tax, would be much fairer than indirect taxation.
And that is why the Social-Demo­ crats strive to secure the abolition of indirect taxation and to introduce a graduated income tax.
Naturally, all the property owners, all the bourgeoisie object to this measure and resist it.
Only by a firm alliance between the rural poor and the urban workers can 'this improvement be won from the bourgeoisie.
Finally, a very important improvement for the whole of the people, and for the rural poor in particular, would be the free education of children, which the Social-Democrats demand.
To­ day there are far fewer schools in the country than in the towns, and besides, it is only the rich classes, only the bourgeoisie, who arc in a position to give their children a good education.
Only the free and compulsory education of all children can free the people at least to some extent from their present state of ignor­ ance.
And it is the rural poor who suffer most from this ignorance, who stand in particular need of education.
Of course, the education wc want is genuine, free education, and not the sort supplied by the officials and the priests.
The Social-Democrats further demand that everyone have the unrestricted right to belong to whatever denomination he pleases.
Of the European countries Russia and Turkey are the only ones which have retained these shameful laws against persons belonging to any other religion than the Orthodox religion, the laws against schismatics, dissenters and Jews.
These laws either directly forbid the practice of a certain religion or forbid preaching it, or deprive those who belong to it of certain rights.
All these laws are as unjust, as arbitrary and as shameful as can be.
Everyone must be perfectly free not only to belong to whatever religion he pleases, he must be free to preach his religion and to change his religion.
No official should be entitled even to ask anyone about his religion: it is a matter for that person’s conscience and no one has any busi­ ness to interfere.
There must be no “dominating” religion or church.
All religions, all churches must be equal before the law.
The priests of the various religions must be paid salaries by those who belong to their religions, but the state must not use state money to support any religion whatever, must not grant money to maintain any priests, Orthodox, schismatic, dis­ senters, or any others.
This is what the Social-Democrats fight for, and until these measures are carried out without any re­ servation and without any subterfuge, the people will not be freed from the shameful police persecution of religion, or from the no less shameful police doles to one of these religions.
♦ * * We have seen what improvements the Social-Democrats de­ mand for all the people and especially for the poor.
Now let us see what improvements they demand for the workers, not only for the urban and factory workers, but also for the agricul­ tural labourers.
The factory workers live in much more congested conditions; they work in large workshops, it is easier for them to avail themselves of the assistance of educated Social-Demo­ crats.
That is why the urban workers were the first to start the struggle against the employers, and to ohtain certain improve­ ments, even to obtain the passing of factory laws.
But the Social­ Democrats fight to have these improvements extended to all the workers: to the handicraftsmen who work for an employer at home, both in town and country, to »the wage workers employed by small masters and artisans, to the workers in the building trades (carpenters, bricklayers, etc.
)—and to the lumberjacks and the unskilled labourers—and to the agricultural labourers as rnuch as to the rest.
All over Russia, all these workers are now beginning to unite, following the example and with the aid of the factory workers, to unite for the struggle for better con­ ditions of life, for a shorter working day, for higher wages.
And the Social-Democratic Party has set itself the task of sup­ porting all workers in their struggle for a better life, of helping them to organise (to unite) the most resolute and the most reliable workers into strong unions, of helping them by circul­ ating books and leaflets, by sending experienced workers to those fresh to the movement and helping them in every possible way.
When we have obtained political liberty, we shall also have our men in the national assembly of deputies, there will be worker-representatives, Social-Democrats, and like their com­ rades in other countries, they will demand laws for the protec­ tion of the workers.
We shall not enumerate all the improvements the Social-Demo­ cratic Party strives to obtain for the workers: they have all been set forth in our programme and explained in detail in a book called The Workers’ Cause in Russia.
1 Here it will be sufficient to mention the most important of these improvements.
The work­ ing day must not be longer than eight hours.
One day a week must always be a rest day.
Overtime must be absolutely forbid­ den, and so must night work.
Children up to the age of sixteen must be given free education, and must consequently not be allowed to work for wages until that age.
Women must not work in trades %dangerous to their health.
The employer must compensate the workers for all disablement caused during work, for example, for injury caused by work on threshing machines, winnowing machines, etc.
All wage workers must be paid weekly, 1A pamphlet by L.
Martov, setting out, in a popular form, the prin­ ciples of the Social-Democratic programme.
—Ed.
and not once in two months or once a quarter as is often the case with agricultural labourers.
It is very important for the workers to be paid regularly every week and to be paid in cash, and not in goods.
Employers arc in the habit of making the workers accept all sorts of worthless goods at exorbitant prices in pay­ ment of wages; to put an end to ‘this disgraceful practice the payment of wTages in kind must be absolutely prohibited.
Further, aged workers must be given pensions by the state.
The workers by their labour maintain all the rich classes, and the whole state, and this gives them as good a right to receive a pension as the government officials.
In order that the employers may not take advantage of their position to disregard the rules introduced to protect the workers, inspectors must be appointed to supervise not only the factories, but also the large farms of the landlords and, in general, all enterprises where w'age labour is employed.
But these inspectors must not be officials, they must not ibe appointed by Ministers or governors, they must not be in .
the service of the police.
The inspectors must be elected by the workers, the state must pay salaries to persons who enjoy the confidence of the workers and whom they have freely elected.
These elected representatives of the workers must see to it that the workers’ lodgings are in proper condition, that the employers do not dare compel the workers to live in what is like a dog’s kennel or a dug-out (as is often the case with agricultural labourers), that the rules concerning the workers’ rest are observed, and so on.
Again, it must be borne in mind that no elected workers* representatives will be of any use to the work­ ers as long as there is no political liberty, as long as the police are all-powerful, and are not responsible to the people.
Every­ one knows that the police now arrest not only workers’ delegates, but every worker who dares speak in the name of all his fellow workers, who dares expose breaches of the law or call on the workers to unite.
But when we have political liljerty, the work­ ers’ delegates will be of great use.
All employers (manufacturers, landlords, contractors, rich peasants) must be absolutely forbidden to make any deductions from the wages of their workers on their own accord, for ex­ ample, deductions for bad work, deductions in the form of fines, etc.
It is illegal and tyrannical for employers to make deductions from the wages of the workers on their own accord.
The employer must not reduce a worker’s wage on the pretext of fines and deductions, or in any way whatsoever.
The employer cannot act as judge and executive (a fine sort of judge who pockets for himself deductions from the worker’s wages!), he must go to a proper court, and this court must consist of dele­ gates elected by the workers and the employers in equal num­ bers.
Only such a court will be able to judge fairly all the grievances of the employers against the workers and of the workers against the employers.
These are the improvements the Social-Democrats strive to obtain for the whole of the working class.
The workers on every estate, on every farm, in the service of every contractor, must meet and discuss with persons worthy of their confidence what improvements they must strive to obtain and what demands they should advance (for the demands of the workers will, of course, be different in different factories, in different farms and with different contractors).
Social-Democratic committees all over Russia are helping the workers to formulate their demands in a clear and precise way, and are helping them to issue printed leaflets where all these de­ mands are set out, so that they may be knowm to all the work­ ers, and to the employers and the authorities.
When the workers unite as one man in support of their demands, the employers always have to give way and agree to them.
In the towns the workers have obtained many improvements in this way, and now the village craftsmen and the artisans and the agricultural la­ bourers are also beginning to unite (ito organise) and to fight for their demands.
As long as we have no political liberty we carry on the fight in secret, hiding from the police who prohibit the publication of leaflets and the combination of the workers.
But when we have won political liberty, we shall carry on the fight on a larger scale and carry it on quite openly, so that the toilers all over Russia may unite as one man and defend them­ selves from oppression.
The greater the number of workers who are united in the workers Social-Democratic Party, the stronger will they be, the sooner will they be able to free the working class from all oppression, from all wage labour, from being compelled to work for the bourgeoisie.
« • « We have said that the Social-Democratic Party strives to ob­ tain improvements not only for the workers, but for all the peasants as well.
Now let us see what improvements it strives to obtain for the peasants.
6.
What Improvements Do the Social-Democrats Strive to Obtain for All the Peasants? In order to secure the complete emancipation of all the toil­ ers, the rural poor, united with the urban workers, must fight against the whole of the bourgeoisie including the rich peasants.
The rich peasants will try to pay their farmhands as little as possible and make them work as long and as hard as possible, while the workers in town and country will try to secure better wages, better conditions and regular periods of rest for the farmhands working for the rich peasants.
This means that the rural poor must form unions of their own, which shall not in­ clude the rich peasants.
We have already mentioned this point, and we shall always repeat it.
But in Russia, all the peasants, rich and poor, are still serfs in many respects; they constitute an inferior, “black” tax-paying estate; they are the serfs of the police officers and of the Zemsky Nachalniks; very often they have to work for the landlord in payment for the use of otrezki, for watering places, for pasture, or for a meadow, just as they used to do for the feudal lord under serfdom.
All the peasants want to be free from this new serfdom, all of them want to have equal rights, all of them hate the landlords who still force them to do serf labour work, to do “otrabotki” 1 in payment for the use of the gentry’s land and pas­ tures and meadows, to work also “for trespassing,” and to send their womenfolk to reap the landlord’s field “for the honour of it.
”* 1 The payment of rent by work.
—Ed.
Eng.
ed.
This work for the landlord is a greater burden for the poor peasants than for die rich peasants.
The rich peasant is often able to pay the landlord money in lieu of this work, but even the rich peasant is badly squeezed by the landlord.
Hence, the rural poor must fight against their lack of rights, against every kind of barshchina, against every kind of otrabotki, side by side with the rich peasants.
We shall be able to abolish all bondage, all poverty only when we overcome the bourgeoisie as a whole (including the rich peasants).
But there are forms of bondage which we can abolish before that time, because even the rich peasant suffers badly from diem.
There are still many localities and many districts in Russia where very often die peasants are quite like serfs.
This is why the Russian workers and all the ru­ ral poor must carry on a fight with both hands and on two sides: with one hand—a fight against all the bourgeois, in alliance with all the workers, and with the other hand—a fight against the offi­ cials in the villages, against the feudal landlords, in alliance with all the peasants.
Unless the rural poor form a union of their own, which shall not include the rich peasants, they will be taken in and deceived by the rich peasants, who will become landlords themselves, while the poor will not only remain poor, but will not even be granted the right to combine.
Unless the rural poor fight side by side with the rich peasants against feudal bondage, they will remain fettered and attached to one spot, nor will they gain freedom to combine with the urban workers.
The rural poor must begin by striking a blow al the landlords and dirowing off at least the most vicious and harmful forms of feudal bondage; in diis fight many of the rich peasants and adherents of the bourgeoisie will take the side of the poor, be­ cause everyone is fed up with the arrogance of the nobles.
But as soon as we have curtailed the power of die landlords, the rich peasant’s nature will at once reveal itself and he will stretch out his paws to grab everything; his paws are good for grabbing, and have already grabbed a great deal.
Hence we must be on our guard, and form a strong inseverable alliance with the urban workers.
The urban workers will help to knock die old habits out of die landlords and to tame the rich peasants 19 Lenin II a bit (as they have already succeeded in taming their bosses, the manufacturers, somewhat).
Without an alliance with the urban workers the rural poor will never rid themselves of bondage, of poverty and distress; except for the urban workers, there is no one to help the village poor, and they can count on no one but themselves.
But there are improvements which we can obtain first, which we can obtain at the very outset of the groat strug­ gle.
There is much bondage in Russia of a kind that has long ceased to exist in other countries, and it is this bondage to the officials, to the landlords, this feudal bondage, that the Russian peasantry as a whole can rid itself of immediately.
Let us now see what improvements the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
strives to obtain first of all, so as to free the Russian peasantry as a whole from at least the most vicious feudal ‘bondage, so as to urttie the hands of the rural poor for their struggle against the Russian bourgeoisie as a whole.
The first demand of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
is that all land compensa­ tion payments, all quit rent, all dues the peasantry has to pay as a “lax-paying” estate, must be abolished immediately.
When committees of the nobles and the Russian tsar’s govern­ ment which protected the nobles “emancipated” the peasants from serfdom, the peasants were compelled to buy out their own land, to pay for the land which they had tilled for genera­ tions! This was robbery.
The committees of the nobles, with the aid of the tsarist government, simply robbed the peasants.
In many places the tsarist government sent troops to impose the statutory charters 1 by force of arms.
and to subdue, by military execution, the peasants who refused to accept the curtailed “pauper” holdings.
Without the help of the military, without tortures and shootings, the committees of the nobles would never have been able to rob the peasants in the brazen way they did at the time of the emancipation of the serfs.
The peasants must always remember tire way they were robbed and defrauded by these committees of the nobles and landlords, because now, as then, the tsarist government, whenever it appoints a committee 1 Regulations governing the emancipation of the serfs.

to make new laws concerning the peasants, never appoints any.
one but landlords and officials to sit on it.
The tsar recently issued a manifesto (March 11 [February 26], 1903)* in which he promises to revise and improve the laws concerning the peas­ ants.
Who will do this revising and improving? Why, again the nobility, again the officials! The peasants will continue to be defrauded until they succeed in getting peasant committees formed to improve their conditions.
It is time the landlords, the Zemsky Nachalniks and all the officials stopped ordering the peasants about! It is time to put an end to this serfdom of the peasant to every police officer, to every young profligate noble, man who now bears the title of Zemsky Nachalnik, to every police captain or governor! The peasants must demand that they be allowed to settle their affairs themselves, that they themselves be allowed to draw up, to pass and to carry out new laws.
The peasants must demand the formation of freely elected peasant committees, and until they obtain this they will always be de­ frauded and robbed by the nobility and the officials.
No one will free the peasants from the official bloodsuckers until they free themselves, until they unite and take their fate into their own hands.
The Social-Democrats not only demand the complete and im­ mediate abolition of land compensation payments, of quit rent and of imposts of every kind, they also demand that the sums already taken from the people as compensation for the land be refunded to the people.
The peasants all over Russia have paid hundreds of millions of rubles since they were emancipated from serfdom by the committees of the nobles.
The peasants must demand that this money be returned to them.
Let the government impose a special tax on the big landowning nobility, (et the land be taken from the monasteries and from the Department of Appanages (i.
e.
, from the tsar’s family), let the national assembly of deputies use this money for the benefit of the peasants.
Nowhere in the world is the peasant so down­ trodden or so impoverished as in Russia.
Nowhere do millions of peasants die of starvation as they do in Russia.
The peasants in Russia have been reduced to starvation because they were 19* robbed long ago by the committees of the nobles, and are being robbed to this day by being forced to pay tribute to the heirs of the feudal landlords every year in the form of compensation payments and quit rent.
The robbers must be made to answer for their crimes! Let money be taken from the big landed nobility in order to provide serious relief for the famine-stricken.
What the starving peasant wants is not charity, not doles; he must demand that the money he has paid for years and years to the landlords and to the stale be returned to him.
Then the national assembly of deputies and the peasant committees will be able to give real help to the starving.
Further.
The Social-Democratic Labour Party demands the im­ mediate abolition of mutual responsibility1 and of all laws which restrict the peasant in the free disposal of his land.
The tsar’s Manifesto of March 11 (February 26), 1903, promises the abolition of mutual responsibility.
A law to this effect has al­ ready been passed.
But tills is net enough.
All the laws that prevent the peasant from freely disposing of his land must be abolished immediately; otherwise, even without mutual respons­ ibility, the peasant will not be free and will remain a semi­ serf.
The peasant must be made entirely free to dispose of his land: to lease or sell it to whomever he pleases without having to ask for permission.
This is something the tsar’s ukase does not authorise: the gentry, the merchants and the townspeople are free to dispose of their land, but the peasant is not.
The muzhik is treated like an infant, he must have a Zemsky Nachalnik to look after him, like a nurse.
The muzhik must not be allowed to sell his allotment or else he will squander the money! This is the serf owner’s way of arguing, and there are simpletons who believe him and, wishing the peasant well, they say that he must not be allowed to sell his land.
Even the Narodniki (of whom we have already spoken) and the people who call them­ selves “Socialist-Revolutionaries” yield to this argument and agree that it is better that the peasant should remain just a bit of a serf rather than that he be allowed to sell his land.
1 All the peasants in a village community were collectively held res­ ponsible for the payment of taxes, etc.

The Social-Democrats say: this is nothing but hypocrisy, noth­ ing but noblemen’s ideas, nothing but smooth talk! When we have attained socialism, when the working class has conquered the bourgeoisie, the land will be owned in common and no one will have the right to sell land.
But what is to be the position in the meantime? Arc the nobleman and the merchant to be allowed to sell their land, and is the peasant not to be allowed to do so?! Are the nobleman and the merchant to be free while the peasant remains a semi-serf? Is the peasant to continue to have to beg permission from the authorities? All tliis is just deceit, concealed under a lot of smooth words—but deceit for all that As long as the nobleman and the merchant are allowed to sell land, the peasant must also have the unrestricted right to sell his land and to dispose of it with complete freedom, in ex­ actly the same way as the nobleman or the merchant.
When the working class is victorious over the whole of the bourgeoisie, it will take the land away from the big proprietors and introduce co-operative farming on the big estates, so that the workers will farm the land together, in common, and fr?ely elect trusted men to manage the farms.
They will use machinery to save labour; they will work in shifts for not more than eight (or even six) hours daily.
Then the small peasant who prefers to carry on his farm in the old way on individual lines will not produce for the market, to sell to anyone who comes along, but will produce for the workers’ associations; the small peasant will supply the workers’ associations with com, meat, vege­ tables, and the workers in return will provide him with machin­ ery, livestock, fertilizers, clothes and whatever else he may re­ quire, without his having to pay for it.
Then there will be no struggle for money between the big and the small farmer, then there will be no wage labour for others; all workers will work for themselves, all labour-saving devices and all machinery will benefit the workers and help to make their work easier, to im­ prove their standard of living.
But every sensible man will realise that socialism cannot be attained at one stroke: to attain it we must wage a fierce struggle against die whole of the bourgeoisie and all the governments, we must unite to form a solid, inseverable alliance of all the urban workers in Russia with all the rural poor.
This is a great cause, it is worth devoting one’s life to.
But until we have at­ tained socialism, the big owner will always fight against the small owner for money.
Is the big landowner to be free to sell his land, and is the small peasant not to be free to do so? We repeat: the peasants are not infants and they will not allow any­ one to order them about; the peasants must receive all the rights that are enjoyed by the nobility and the merchants, all these rights without restriction.
We are told that the peasant’s land is not his own, it is com­ munal land, that everyone cannot be allowed to sell communal land.
This too is a lie.
Have not the nobles and the merchants their communities? Do not the nobles and the merchants combine to form companies to buy land and factories, or any other thing in common? Why then are no restrictions invented for the as­ sociations of the nobility? And why do the police scum zealous­ ly invent restrictions and prohibitions when it comes to the muzhik? The peasants have never seen any good from the offi­ cials, they have seen only beatings, extortions and bullying.
The peasants will never see anything good until they take their affairs into their own hands, until they obtain equal rights and complete freedom.
If the peasants want their land to be communal, no one will dare interfere with them, and they will voluntarily form a community which will include whomever they like and on what­ ever terms they like, they wnll freely draw up a communal con­ tract in whatever form they like.
And let no official dare poke his nose into the communal affairs of the peasants.
Let no one ex­ ercise his wits on the peasants to invent prohibitions and dis­ abilities for them.
There is one more important improvement the Social-Demo­ crats strive to obtain for the peasants.
They want to restrict the peasants’ bondage to the nobility, their feudal bondage, im­ mediately.
As long as poverty exists bondage cannot be com­ pletely abolished, and poverty cannot be abolished as long as the land and the factories are in the hands of the bourgeoisie, as long as money is the principal power in the world, and until a socialist society has been established.
But in Russia, in the rural districts much bondage of a particularly vicious sort still survives which no longer exists in foreign countries, although socialism has not yet been introduced there.
There is still much feudal bondage in Russia which is profitable to all the land­ lords, which weighs heavily on all the peasants, and which can and must be abolished immediately and first of all.
Let us explain the sort of bondage we call feudal bondage.
Everyone who lives in the countryside knows cases like the following.
The landlord’s land adjoins the peasant’s land.
At the time of the emancipation, plots of land that were indispens­ able for the peasants were cut off from the peasants’ land; pas­ ture, woods, watering places were cut off in this way.
The peas­ ants could not do without these otrezki, without the pasture, or without the watering place.
Whether they liked it or not the peasants were forced to go to the landlord to ask him to permit their cattle to go to the water, or to lease the pasture or something of that kind.
The landlord does not farm any land, and may even have no money at all, he lives only by keeping the peasants in bondage.
In return for the use of the otrezki the peasants work for him for nothing: they plough his land with their horses, they gather in his corn and his hay, they thresh his grain for him, sometimes they even have to cart their manure to the landlord’s fields, or bring him homespun cloth, and eggs and poultry.
Just as under serfdom! Under serfdom the peas­ ants had to work for nothing for the landlord in whose manor they lived, and today they very often have to work for nothing for die landlord in return for the very same land which the committees of the nobles filched from them at the time of the emancipation.
It does not differ from barshchina* And in some provinces the peasants actually call it barshchina or punshchina.
Well, this is what we call feudal bondage.
At the time of the emancipation from serfdom the landlords, the committees of the nobles, contrived matters in such a way as to keep the peasants 1 Russian for serf labour.
—Ed, Eng.
ed, in bondage in the old way.
They would deliberately curtail the peasants’ allotments, and deliberately drive a wedge of land­ lord’s land in between the peasant’s holdings so as to make it impossible for him even to let his hen out without trespassing; they would deliberately transfer the peasants to land of worse quality, block the way to the watering place by a strip of land­ lord’s land—in a word, they contrived matters in such a way that the peasants found themselves in a trap, and could easily be taken captive.
There are still countless numbers of villages where the peasants are in the power of the local landlord, quite as much as they wrere under serfdom.
In villages like these the rich peasant and the poor peasant are both bound hand and foot and delivered defenceless to the landlord.
The poor peasant suffers from this state of affairs even worse than the rich peas­ ant.
The rich peasant sometimes owns some land and sends his labourers to work for the landlord instead of going himself, but the poor peasant has no way out and the landlord has him at his mercy.
Under this bondage the peasant often has not a mo­ ment’s breathing space; he cannot even go away from his land­ lord to look for work elsewhere; he has no time to think of uniting in an association, in one party with all the rural poor and the urban workers.
Now let us see whether it is possible to abolish this sort of bondage at once, without delay, immediately.
The Social-Demo­ cratic Labour Party proposes two measures to this end.
But we must repeat that only socialism can deliver the poor from all bondage, for as long as the rich have power they will always oppress the poor in one way or another.
It is not possible to abolish all bondage at one stroke, but it is possible greatly to restrict the most vicious, the most disgusting form of bondage, feudal bondage, which weighs heavily on the poor, on the mid­ dle and even on the rich peasants; it is possible Io obtain im­ mediate relief for the peasants.
There are two means to this end.
The first means: freely elected courts consisting of delegates of the farmhands and of the poorest peasants, as well as of the rich peasants and of the landlords.
The second means: freely elected peasant committees.
These peasant committees must be empowered not only to discuss and adopt measures for the abolition of barshchina, for the abolition of the survivals of serfdom, but they must also be empowered to confiscate the “otrezki9 and return them to the peasants.
Let us consider these two measures a little more closely.
Freely elected courts consisting of trusted people will consider all cases arising out of complaints of peasants against bond­ age.
These courts will be empowered to reduce rents if the land­ lord, taking advantage of the peasants’ poverty, has fixed them too high.
These courts will lie empowered to free the peasants from excessive payments, as in cases when a landlord engages a peasant in the winter for summer work at an excessively low wage; the court will judge the case and fix a fair wage.
.
Of course, the court must not consist of officials, but of freely elected, trusted people, and the agricultural labourers and the rural poor must also elect their representatives whose num­ ber must not in any case be less than those elected by the rich peasants and the landlords.
These courts must also try cases between labourers and employers.
When courts like these have been established it will be easier for the labourers and all the rural poor to defend their rights, to unite and to as­ certain what people can be trusted to stand up for the poor and for the workers.
The other measure is still more important.
This is the estab­ lishment of free peasant committees consisting of elected repre­ sentatives of the farmhands and of the poor, middle and rich peasants in every uyezd (or, if the peasants think fit, they may elect several committees in each uyezd; perhaps they will even prefer to establish a committee in every volost and in every large village).
No one knows better than the peasants the bond­ age that weighs on them.
No one will be able to expose the landlords who to this day live on feudal bondage better than the peasants themselves.
The peasant committees will decide what otrezki.
what meadows or pastures or the like were taken away unfairly; they will decide whether these lands shall be taken without compensation or whether some compensation shall be paid, at the expense of the big nobility, to those who bought that land.
The peasant committees will at all events release the peasants from the traps into which they were driven by the com­ mittees of the nobles.
The peasant committees will relieve the peasants of the interference of the officials, they will show that the peasants can and want to manage their own affairs, they will help the peasants to come to a common understanding concern­ ing their needs and to recognise those who really stand for the rural poor and for an alliance with the urban workers.
The peasant committees will be a first step towards enabling the peasants, in the remote countryside, to staiM on their own feet and to take their fate into their own hands.
This is why die Social -Democratic workers warn the peasants: Not to place any faith in any committees of the nobles, or in any official commissions; To demand an assembly of deputies elected by the whole people; To demand the establishment of peasant committees; To demand complete freedom to publish books and papers of every kind.
When all have the right freely and fearlessly to express their opinions and their wishes in the national assembly of deputies in the peasant committees and in the newspapers, it will soon be seen who is on the side of the working class, and who is on the side of the bourgeoisie.
Today, the great majority of the people simply do not think about these things, some conceal their real views, some do not yet know their own minds, some lie deliberately.
But when everyone begins thinking about it, there will be no reason for concealing any tiling, and everything will soon become clear.
We have already said that the bour­ geoisie will draw the rich peasants to its side.
The sooner and the more completely we succeed in abolishing peasant bondage, the more real freedom will the peasants succeed in obtaining for themselves, the sooner will the rural poor unite among them­ selves and the sooner will the rich peasants unite with the rest of the bourgeoisie.
Let diem unite: we are not afraid of their uniting, although we know perfectly well that this alliance will make the rich peasants more powerful.
But wc too shall unite.
and our alliance, the alliance between the rural poor and the urban workers, will be immeasurably wider; it will be an alli­ ance of tens of millions against an alliance of hundreds of thousands.
We also know that the bourgeoisie will try (it is already trying!) to attract the middle and even the small peas­ ants to its side; it will try to deceive them, Ito entice them, to sow dissension among them by promising to pull them up into the ranks of the .
rich.
We have seen the tricks and deceits the bourgeoisie resort to in order to win over die middle peasant.
We must therefore warn the rural poor beforehand, and before­ hand consolidate their special alliance widi die urban workers against the bourgeoisie as a whole.
Let every villager look around carefully.
How often do we hear the rich peasants talking against the nobility, against the landlords! How they complain of the oppression which the people suffer! or of the landlords’ land lying waste! How diey like to have a good heart-to-heart talk about what a good thing it would be if the peasants got possession of die land! Can we believe what the rich say? No, we cannot: they do not want the land for the people, but for themselves.
They have ac­ cumulated lots of land, in freehold or in leasehold, and still they are not satisfied.
This shows that the rural poor will not have to march side by side with the rich against the landlords very long.
Only the first step will have to lie taken in their company, after that their ways will part.
All this shows why we must draw a very clear distinction be­ tween this first step and subsequent steps, and our last and most important step.
The first step in the rural districts will be die complete emancipation of the peasant, full rights for the peas­ ant and the establishment of peasant committees for the purpose of restoring the otrezki.
But our last step will be the same every­ where, in town and country alike: we shall take all the land, all the factories from the landlords and from the bourgeoisie and set up a socialist society.
There will be a lot of fighting in the period between die first step and the last step, and those who confuse the first step with the last step impede the struggle and unwittingly help to deceive the rural poor.
The rural poor will take the first step together with all the peasants: a few kulaks may fall out, perhaps there is one peas­ ant in a hundred who does not suffer from bondage in some form or other.
The mass of the peasants will continue to ad­ vance as one whole, because all the peasants want equal rights.
Bondage to the landlords ties everyone hand and foot.
But the last step will never be taken by all the peasants together: all the rich peasants will turn against the labourers.
Then we shall require a solid alliance between the village poor and the Social-Democratic workers of the towns.
Those who tell the peasants that they can take the first and the last step simultaneously are deceiving the peasants.
They forget about the great struggle go­ ing on among the peasants themselves, the great struggle be­ tween the rural poor and the rich peasants.
That is why the Social-Democrats do not promise the peasants a land flowing with milk and honey at once.
That is why the Social-Democrats first of all demand complete freedom for the struggle, for the great popular struggle of the working class against the whole of the bourgeoisie.
That is why the Social-Democrats advise a small but sure first step.
There are people who imagine that our demand for the estab­ lishment of peasant committees for the restriction of bondage and for the restitution of the otrezki is a sort of fence or barrier, as if we meant to say: thus far and no further.
These people have not given sufficient thought to what the Social-Democrats propose.
The demand for the establishment of peasant commit­ tees for the restriction of bondage and for the restitution of the otrezki is not a barrier.
It is a door.
* We must pass through this door to be able to go further, to be able to take the wide and open road to the ultimate goal, to the complete emancipa­ tion of all the toilers in Russia.
Until the peasants pass through this door they will remain in ignorance and bondage, without full rights, without complete, real freedom; they will not even be able to decide among themselves who is the friend of the workingman and who his enemy.
That is why the Social-Demo­ crats point to this door and say that the first thing to do is for all the peasantry, for all the people to push at this door and break it down completely.
But there are people who call them­ selves Narodniki and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who also wish the peasant well; they shout and make a noise and wave their arms about and want to help him, but they cannot see the door.
And so unseeing are these people that they even say: there is no need to give the peasant the right to dispose of his land as he pleases! They wish the peasant well, but they argue exactly like the serf owners! Such friends can be of little assistance.
What is the use of wishing the peasant the very best things in the world if you fail to see the first door that must be forced? What is the use of wanting socialism if you don’t see the way out to the road of the free people’s struggle for socialism, not only in the towns, but also in the country, and not only against ihe landlords, but also against the rich peasants in the village com­ munity , in the “mir”? That is why the Social-Democrats point so insistently to tills first and nearest door.
The difficult thing at this stage is not to express a lot of good wishes, but to point to the right road, to make people clearly understand how the first step should be taken.
For die past forty years all the friends of the peasant have been talking and writing about the Russian peasant being crushed by bondage and about his still being a semi-serf.
Long before there were any Social-Democrats in Russia, die friends of the peasant had written dozens of books describing how shame­ fully the landlords robbed and enslaved die peasant by means of the otrezki.
All honest people now realise that the peasant must be given assistance at once, without delay, that he must get at least some relief from this bondage; even the officials of our police-ridden government are beginning to discuss this.
The ques­ tion is, how to set about it, what the first step should be, and which is the first door to be forced.
Various people (diose who wish die peasant well) answer this question in one of two ways.
Every rural proletarian must try to understand diese two answers to the question, and form a definite opinion on them.
The Narodniki and the Socialist-Rev­ olutionaries answer die question in one way.
The first thing to be done, they say, is to develop all sorts of societies (co-opera­ tive societies) among the peasants.
The rnir must be strength' ened.
The individual peasant must not be given the right to dis­ pose of his land freely.
Let the rights of the community, the mir, he extended, and let all the land in Russia gradually become communal land.
The peasants must be granted every facility to purchase land, so that the land may more easily pass from capital to labour.
The Social-Democrats' answer is different.
The peasant must first of all obtain for himself all the rights possessed by the nobility and the merchants.
The peasant must obtain the un­ restricted right freely to dispose of his land.
Peasant committees must be established for the abolition of the more despicable forms of bondage and for the restitution of the otrezki.
We want not the unity of the mir, hut the unity of the rural poor in the rural communities all over Russia, the alliance of the rural proletarians with the urban proletarians.
Co-operatives and the communal purchase of land will always be most profitable for the rich peasants, and will always help to hoodwink the middle peasants.
The Russian government realises that some relief must be given to the peasants, but it wants to be let off for next to nothing, it wants everything to be done by the officials.
The peasants must be on the look-out, because the official commissions will cheat them as badly as the committees of the nobles did.
The peasants must demand the institution of freely elected peasant committees.
The important thing is, not to expect improvement from the officials, but for the peasants to take their fate into their own hands.
Even if we at first take only one step, even if we at first abolish only the worst forms of bondage—at least the peasants will realise their power, will freely reach an under­ standing with each other and unite! No honest person can deny that the otrezki are often made the instrument of the most des­ picable feudal bondage.
No honest person can deny that our demand is the first and fairest of demands: let the peasants freely, without the officials, elect their own committees for the abolition of feudal bondage.
In the free peasant committees (as well as in the free assembly of representatives of the whole of Russia) the Social-Democrats will do all they can from the outset to consolidate the special alliance of the rural proletarians with the urban proletarians.
The Social-Democrats will advocate all measures that are favour­ able to the rural proletarians and will help them to follow up the first step—as early as possible and as unanimously as pos­ sible—with the second and the third step, and so on till the very end, till the complete victory oj the proletariat.
But can we say today what demand will arise tomorrow for the second step? No, we cannot because we do not know what the behaviour of the rich peasants will be, and of many educated people who are concerned about co-operatives and about the land passing from capital to labour.
Perhaps they will not join the landlords on the morrow; per­ haps they will want to finish off landlord rule completely.
Very good! The Social-Democrats would like this to happen very much, and they will advise the rural and the urban proletarians to demand that all the land be taken from the landlords and be transferred to the free people’s state.
The Social-Democrats will see to it that the rural proletarians are not cheated in the course of this, and that they consolidate their forces for the final struggle for the complete emancipation of the proletariat.
But things may take a very different turn; in fact it is more likely that they will lake a different turn.
On the very day after the worst forms of bondage have been restricted and curtailed, the rich peasants and many of the educated people may unite with the landlords, and then the rural proletariat as a whole will have the whole of the rural bourgeoisie against it.
In that event it would be ridiculous for us to go on fighting only against the landlords.
We would have to fight the bourgeoisie as a whole, and our first demand would have to be: the greatest possible freedom and elbow room for this fight, improved con­ ditions for the workers in order to make the fight easier for them.
In any case, whatever turn things may take, our first, our principal and indispensable task is to consolidate the alliance between the rural proletarians and semi-proletarians and the urban proletarians.
To obtain this we must at once and without delay secure unrestricted political freedom for the people, com­ plete equality of rights for the peasants and the abolition of feudal bondage.
And when this alliance is established and con­ solidated, it will be easy for us to expose all the deceits to which the bourgeoisie resorts in order to attract the middle peasant, we shall easily and quickly take the second and third and last steps against the whole of the bourgeoisie, against all the gov­ ernment forces, we shall march straight to victory and quickly achieve the complete emancipation of all the toilers.
7.
The Class Struggle in the Countryside What is the class struggle? It is the struggle of one part of the people against the other, the struggle waged by all the dis­ franchised, the oppressed, the toilers, against the privileged, the oppressors, the parasites; the struggle of the wage labourers, or proletarians, against the property owners, or bourgeoisie.
In the rural districts of Russia, too, this great struggle has always gone on and is now going on, although not everyone is aware of it, and although not everyone realises its significance.
In the period of serfdom the peasants as a whole fought against their oppres­ sors, the landlord class, which was protected, defended and sup­ ported by the tsarist government.
The peasants then were unable to unite, they were utterly crushed by ignorance; they had no urban workers to help them and be brothers to them; never­ theless they fought as best they could.
They were not afraid of the brutal persecution of the government, they were not afraid of execution and bullets, they did not believe the priests who tried hard to prove that serfdom was approved by the Bible and sanctified by God (this is what the Metropolitan Philaret actu­ ally said), the peasants rose in rebellion, now in one place and now in another, and at last the government gave in, fearing a general insurrection of all the peasants.
Serfdom was abolished, but not altogether.
The peasants re­ mained disfranchised, they remained an inferior, poll-tax-pay­ ing, “black” estate, they remained in the clutches of feudal bondage.
And tire unrest among the peasants continued, they continued to seek complete, real freedom.
Meanwhile, a new class struggle developed, the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie.
Wealth increased, railways and factories were built in great numbers, the towns grew still more populous and full of luxury, but all this wealth was appropriated by a very few, while the people became poorer, more impoverished and starved, and they had to leave their homes to go and work for wages among strangers.
The urban workers began a great struggle of all the poor against all the rich.
The urban workers united to form a Social-Democratic Party and to carry on the struggle persistently, determinedly and unitedly, advancing step by step, preparing for the great final struggle, demanding pol­ itical liberty for all the people.
At last the peasants, too, lost patience.
In the spring of last year, 1902.
the peasants of the Poltava, Kharkov and other guber­ nias rose and marched against the landlords, broke into their barns, shared the contents among themselves, distributed to the starving the grain that had been sown and reaped by the peas­ ants but appropriated by the landlords^ and demanded a new repartition of the land.
The peasants were no longer able to bear the endless oppression, and they began to seek a better lot.
The peasants decided—and rightly decided—that it was better to die fighting the oppressors than to die from starvation with­ out a fight.
But they did not succeed in winning a better lot for themselves.
The tsarist government declared them to be com­ mon rioters and robbers (for having taken from the robber landlords corn that the peasants themselves had sown and reaped!), it sent troops against them as against an enemy, and the peasants were defeated; the peasants were shot down, many were killed; they were all brutally flogged, many were flogged to death< they were tortured worse than the Turks tortured their enemies, the Christians.
The tsar’s envoys, the governors, were the worst torturers, real professional torturers.
The soldiers raped the wives and daughters of the peasants.
And in addition to all this, these peasants were tried by a court of officials, they were compelled to pay the landlords 700,000 rubles, and at the trial, that infamous secret trial, a trial in a torture chamber, 20 Len.
u n counsel were not even allowed to tell how the peasants had been ill-treated and tortured by the tsar’s envoys, Governor Obolen­ sky and the other servants of the tsar.
The peasants fought in a just cause.
The Russian working class will always honour the memory of the martyrs who were shot down and flogged to death by the servants of the tsar.
These martyrs fought for the freedom and happiness of the toilers.
The peasants suffered defeat, but they will rise again and again, undeterred by this first defeat.
The class conscious workers will do all they can to inform the largest possible number of toilers in town and country of the peasants’ struggle and to prepare for a further and more successful fight.
The class conscious workers will do all in their power to help the peasants clearly to understand why the first peasant insurrection of 1902 was put down and what must be done in order to secure victory for the peasants and workers and not for the servants of the tsar.
The peasant insurrection was put down because it was the in­ surrection of an ignorant and unintelligent mass, an insurrection that advanced no political demands, i.
e.
, no demands for changes in the constitution of the state.
The peasant insurrection was put down because no preparations had been made for it beforehand.
The peasant insurrection was put down because the rural pro­ letarians had not yet allied themselves with the urban proletar­ ians.
These are the three causes of the defeat of the peasants in the first fighit.
To be successful the insurrection must have a conscious aim, preparations must be made for it beforehand, it must spread to the whole of Russia and must be organised in alliance with the urban workers.
And every advance in the struggle of the urban workers, every Social-Democratic book or newspaper, every speech made by a class conscious worker to the rural proletarians will serve to bring nearer the time when the insurrection will be repeated and end in victory'.
The peasants rose without a conscious aim, because they could bear their sufferings no longer, because they refused to go on dying like dumb brutes, without a fight.
The peasants had suffered so much from robbery, oppression and torment that they could not but believe, if only for a moment the vague rumours about the tsar’s mercy, they could not but believe that every sensible man would regard it as just that grain should be dis­ tributed among hungry people, among those who had worked all their lives for others, who had sown and reaped, and were now starving, while the “gentry’s” bams were full to overflow­ ing.
The peasants seemed to have forgotten that all the best land and the factories had been seized by the rich, by the landlords and the bourgeoisie precisely for the purpose of starving the people into working for tire property owners.
The peasants for­ got that the rich class is defended not only by the sermons of the priests, but also by the tsarist government with its myriads of bureaucrats and soldiers.
The tsarist government reminded the peasants of all this.
It brutally showed the peasants what state authority is, whose servant and whose protector it is.
We must remind the peasants of this lesson again and again, and then they will easily understand wrhy it is necessary to change the constitution of the state and why we need political liberty.
Peasant insurrections will have a conscious aim when larger and larger numbers of people understand all this, when every peas­ ant who can read and write and who thinks for himself be­ comes familiar with the three principal demands which must be fought for first of all.
The first demand is that a national as­ sembly of deputies be convened with the object of establishing a popular representative government in Russia instead of the present autocratic government.
The second demand is that everyone be free to publish any book or newspaper he pleases.
The third demand is that the complete equality of rights of the peasants with the other estates be recognised by law and that elected peasant committees be convened, with the primary object of abolishing all forms of feudal bondage.
These are the main and fundamental demands of the Social-Democrats, and the peasants will not find it difficult to understand them, to understand what to begin with in the struggle for the people’s liberty.
When the peasants have understood these demands, they will also understand that prepar­ ations for the fight must be made beforehand, by long, persistent and determined work, and that this must not be done in isolation, but together with the Social-Democratic workers in the towns.
20* Let every class conscious worker and peasant rally round him-self the most intelligent, reliable and fearless comrades.
Let him explain to them what the Social-Democrats want so that every one of them may understand the struggle that must be carried on and the demands that must be made.
Let the class conscious Social-Democrats begin gradually, cautiously, but unswervingly, to teach the peasants the doctrines of Social-Democracy, give them Social-Democratic books to read and explain these books at small gatherings of reliable people.
But the doctrines of Social-Democracy cannot be taught from books alone; every instance, every case of oppression and in­ justice we encounter must be used to illustrate these doctrines.
Social-Democracy is the doctrine of struggle against every form of oppression, against every form of robbery and injustice.
A true Social-Democrat is one who knows the causes of oppression and who, all his life, fights every case of oppression.
How can this be done? The class conscious Social-Democrats must meet in their town or village and decide for themselves how it can be done to the best advantage of the whole working class.
To show how it can be done, let me give one or two instances.
Let us suppose that a Social-Democratic worker has come on a visit to his village, or that any Social-Democratic worker has come to any village.
The village, like a fly in a spider’s web, is en­ tirely in the power of the neighbouring landlord; it cannot rid itself of its bondage, cannot escape from this bondage.
The worker must at once single out the most sensible, intelligent and reliable peasants, who are keen on seeing justice done and who will not be frightened by the first police dog they encounter, and explain the causes of this endless bondage, tell them how the landlords cheated the peasants and robbed them with the aid of the committees of the nobles, tell them how powerful the rich are and how they are supported by the tsarist gov­ ernment He must also tell them about the demands of the Social-Democratic workers.
When the peasants have under­ stood all this, the next thing they must do is to put their heads together and devise some way of resisting the landlord, some way of presenting their first and principal demands, in die same way as the urban workers present their demands to the manufacturers.
If it is several villages, or one big village, that are held in bondage by the landlord, the best thing to do will be to obtain a leaflet from the nearest Social-Democratic committee, with the aid of reliable people; in that leaflet the Social-Democratic committee will describe in de­ tail the bondage the peasants suffer from and will formulate their first demands: reduction of rent, fair terms for labourers on winter hire, no brutal persecution of the peasant when his cattle trespass on the landlord’s land, or other appropriate de­ mands.
A leaflet like this will show all the peasants who can read and write what the issue is, and those who cannot read will have it explained to them.
Then the peasants will see that the Social-Democrats are their friends and that the Social-Democrats con­ demn all robbery.
Then the peasants will begin to understand what improvements, if only slight ones, can be obtained im­ mediately and what are the larger improvements for the whole country that will have to be obtained by fighting together with the Social-Democratic workers in the towns.
Then the peasants will prepare for the great struggle, they will learn how to find reliable people and how to stand unitedly for their demands.
Sometimes they may succeed in organising a strike, as the ur­ ban workers do.
Certainly this is more difficult in the country than in the towns, but it is not impossible; in foreign countries there have been successful strikes of farm labourers in the rural districts, for instance, in the busy season when the landlords and rich farmers need hands badly.
If the rural poor are prepared for the strike, if a general agreement has been reached about the demands to be made, if these demands have been explained in a leaflet, or properly explained at meetings, all will stand together as one man and the landlord will have to give in, or at any rate put a curb on his greed.
If the strike is unanimous and is started during the busy season, the landlord and even die authorities with Uieir troops will find it hard to do anything— the landlord will be afraid of losing the season and he will soon become more tractable.
Certainly strikes are something new, and new things do not cojne off well at first, The urban workers did 310 THE FIGHT FOK THE VANGUARD PARTY not know how to fight unitedly at first, they did not know what demands to put forward.
They would go and break the machines and wreck the factory.
But now the workers have learned to stand by each other in a fight.
Every new job must be learned.
Now the workers understand that they can obtain immediate relief if only they act unitedly; meanwhile, the people are learn­ ing to put up united resistance and are more and more preparing for the great and decisive struggle.
Similarly, the peasants will learn to stand up against the worst robbers, to be united in their demands for some measure of relief and to prepare gradually, persistently and all over the country for the great fight for freedom.
The number of class conscious workers and peasants will grow, and the leagues of rural Social-Democrats will become stronger; every case of bondage imposed by the landlord, of extortion on the part of the priest, of police brutal­ ity and bureaucratic oppression, will serve to open the eyes of die people, accustom them to the idea of resistance and of se­ curing a change in the constitution by force.
At the very beginning of this book we said that the urban workers come out into the streets and squares and publicly de­ mand freedom, that they inscribe on their banners and cry: “Down with the Autocracy!” The day will soon come when the urban workers will no longer merely march down the streets shouting, but will rise for the great and final struggle; when the workers will declare as one man: “We shall secure freedom, or die fighting”; when thousands of fresh and more resolute fighters will rise to take the place of the hundreds who are killed or fall in the fight.
The peasants, too, will then rise throughout the length and breadth of Russia, march to the assistance of the urban workers and fight to the end for the freedom of the work­ ers and peasants.
The tsar’s hosts will be unable to withstand this attack.
Victory will go to tlie workers, and the working class will march along the wide road to the liberation of all toilers from oppression.
The working class will use its freedom to fight for socialism! 1903.
THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OE RUSSIAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRACY* Chapter VII .
.
.
We shall now proceed to consider the arguments that have been advanced by the doubters.
1** These arguments may be sum­ med up under the following heads: a) Is the demand for the re­ stitution of the otrezki consistent with the theoretical principles of Marxism and with the principles of the Social-Democratic pro­ gramme? b) Is it rational from the point of view of political expediency to advance the demand for the righting of a histor­ ical wrong, the significance of which is diminishing with every step in economic development? c) Is the demand practically at­ tainable? d) Admitting that we can and must advance such a demand and include in our agrarian programme something that is not a minimum but a maximum, is the demand for the re­ stitution of the otrezki consistent from this point of view? Is such a demand actually a maximum? As far as I can judge, all the objections “against the otrezki” can be included under one of these four points; most of my op­ ponents (including Martynov) answered all four questions in the negative, and consider the demand for the restitution of the otrezki to be theoretically wrong, politically inexpedient, practi­ cally unattainable and logically inconsistent.
Let us now consider all these questions in the order of their importance.
a) Two reasons are given for considering the demand for the restitution of the otrezki to be wrong from the point of view of principle.
In the first place, we are told that it will “affect” capitalist agriculture, i.
e.
, hold up or delay the progress of cap-1 Lenin applies the term doubters to those who raised objections to the demand for the restitution of the otrezki.
—Ed.
311 italism; in the second place, we are told that it will not only fortify, but multiply small holdings.
The first of these arguments (particularly emphasised by Martynov) is quite groundless; on the contrary, typical otrezki retard the progress of capitalism, and their restitution will only stimulate the progress of the lat­ ter; as for cases which are not typical (apart from exceptions which are always possible and which only prove the rule), a reservation was made both in Iskra and in the programme (“.
.
.
land which was cut off and which serves as an instrument of bondage .
.
.
”)• The objection arises simply from a lack of appreciation of the importance of otrezki and otrabotki in Rus­ sian rural economy.
The second argument (which was elaborated in particular de­ tail in private correspondence) is much more serious and is quite the strongest argument against the programme we are here defending.
Speaking generally, it is not the business of the So­ cial-Democrats to develop, encourage, fortify, still less multiply small-scale farming or small property.
But the point is that we are not faced with a “general” but with an exceptional case of small-scale farming, and this exceptional character is clearly ex­ pressed in the preamble to our agrarian programme: “the aboli­ tion of the survivals of serfdom and the free development of the class struggle in the countryside.
” Speaking generally, the en­ couragement of small property is reactionary, because it is directed against large-scale capitalist economy and, consequently, retards the social revolution, and obscures and glosses over the class struggle.
But in this case we want to support small property not against capitalism, but against feudalism; in this case, by sup­ porting the small peasantry we give a tremendous impetus to the development of the class struggle.
Indeed, on the one hand, we, by this, make a last attempt to fan the embers of the class (“estate”) enmity of the peasants towards the feudal landlords.
On the other hand, we pave the way for the development of the bourgeois antagonism of classes in the countryside, because that antagonism is still masked by what is supposed to be the com­ mon and equal oppression of all the peasants by the survivals of serfdom, Everything in the world has two sides to it.
In the West the peasant property owner has already played his part in the dem­ ocratic movement, and he now defends his privileged position as compared with the proletariat.
In Russia the peasant property owner is still on the eve of a determined democratic movement of the whole people, with which he cannot but sympathise.
He still looks forward rather than backward.
He is still much more a fighter ugainst “estate” and feudal privileges, which are still so strong in Russia, than a defender of his own privileged position.
In a historic moment like the present it is our duty to support the peasants and to try to guide their vague and blind discontent against their real enemy.
At a future stage in history, when the special features of the present social and political “situation” have disappeared, when the peasants, let us suppose, have been satisfied by some insignificant doles granted to an insignificant number of property owners and definitely begin “snarling” at the proletariat, we shall not be in the least in­ consistent if we delete the struggle against the survivals of serf­ dom from our programme.
But then, most probably, we shall also have to delete the struggle against tsarism from our pro­ gramme.
for it is inconceivable that the peasants will succeed in ridding themselves of the most disgusting and offensive forms of feudal oppression before political liberty has been attained.
Under capitalist economy, small property retards the develop­ ment of productive forces by binding the worker to a small plot of land, by sanctifying routine in technique, by preventing the land from being drawn into the channels of commerce.
Where the otrabotki system predominates, small landed property by ridding itself of otrabotki stimulates the development of pro­ ductive forces, releases the peasant from the bondage that binds him to one spot, relieves the landlord of “unpaid” servants, deprives him of the possibility of substituting the unlimited ag­ gravation of “patriarchal” exploitation for technical improve­ ments, and facilitates the drawing of the land into the channels of commerce.
In a word, the contradictory position of the small peasantry on the borderline between serfdom and capitalist economy entirely justifies the exceptional and temporary sup­ port of small holdings by the Social-Democrats.
We shall repeat it once more: it is not a contradiction in the wording or in the formulation of our programme, but a contradiction in real life.
It may be argued: “However slowly otrabotki farming may be yielding to the advance of capitalism, still it is yielding, it is, in fact, doomed to disappear altogether; large-scale otrabotki farming is being replaced, and will be directly replaced, by large-scale capitalist farming.
Now you want to accelerate the process of liquidation of serfdom by a measure which, in es­ sence, amounts to the parcellation (the partial parcellation, no doubt, but nevertheless parcellation) of large-scale farms.
In doing so, are you not sacrificing the interests of the future for the interests of the present? For the sake of the problematical possibility of a peasant revolt against serfdom in the immediate future, you are placing obstacles in the way of the revolt of the agricultural proletariat against capitalism in the more or less distant future!** This line of reasoning, however convincing it may seem on the face of it, is very one-sided: in the first place, the small peasantry is also yielding—slowly no doubt, but nevertheless yielding—to the advance of capitalism, and it is ultimately doomed to inevitable elimination; in the second place, large-scale otrabotki farming is not always “directly” replaced by large-scale capitalist farming; very often it gives rise to semi­ independent.
semi-proletarian semi-proprietors.
A revolutionary measure like the restitution of the otrezki would render a great service precisely by substituting the “method” of open revolu-tionarv transformation for the “method” of gradual and imper­ ceptible transformation of feudal dependence into bourgeois de­ pendence: this could not possibly happen without exercising the pro found? st influence on the spirit of protest and of independent struggle of all the rural toiling population.
In the third place, we Russian Social-Democrats must try to avail ourselves of the experience of Europe, and must begin to attract the “country people” to the socialist labour movement at a much earlier stage and much more zealously than our Western comrades were able to do.
They continued to “grope” for the direction the movement of the industrial workers was to take long after political liber­ ty had been won: in this sphere we shall have to take much that is ready-made “from the Germans,” but as far as the agrar­ ian sphere is concerned we may evolve something new.
And in order to make the transition to socialism easier for our rural labourers and semi-labourers, it is highly important that the Socialist Party al once begin to “intercede” on behalf of the small peasants and to do “all it can” for them; it must never refuse a hand in solving the very urgent and very complicated problems of “others” (other than proletarians), and it must teach all the toiling and exploited masses to regard it as their leader and their representative.
To proceed.
b) The demand for the restitution of the otrezki is considered to be politically inexpedient: it is inexpedient ito divert the at­ tention of the Party from the fundamental and steadily ap­ proaching issue of the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to righting all sorts of historical wrongs which arc already beginning to lose their significance.
The idea, says Mar­ tynov sarcastically, “is to re-emancipate the peasants forty years too late.
” This argument, too, appears to be plausible only on the face of it.
There are historical wrongs and historical wrongs.
There are wrongs which are left on one side of the main stream of history, as it were, which erect no barrier and which do not dam the stream, which do not prevent the proletarian class struggle from extending and from striking deeper roots.
It would certainly not be wise to try to right historical wrongs of this kind.
As an example, we shall cite the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany.
No Social-Democratic Party would think of including in its programme the righting of a wrong of this kind, although, on the other hand, not one would shirk its duty of protesting against this injustice and of condemning all the ruling classes for having perpetrated it.
If, as our reason and our only reason for demanding the restitution of the otrezki, we had said: “Look here, a wrong has been com­ mitted.
let us right it,” this would have been no more than a hollow democratic phrase.
We do not justify our demand by whimpering over a historical wrong, but by insisting on the ne­ cessity of abolishing all survivals of serfdom and of clearing the road for the class struggle in the rural districts; and this is something of which the proletariat stands in very “practical” and very urgent need.
We have in this case a different kind of historical wrong, a wrong which still directly retards social evolution and the class struggle.
To renounce the effort to right a historical wrong of this kind would mean “defending the knout on the ground that it is a historical knout.
” The problem of freeing the country from the burden of the survivals of the “old order” is one of the most urgent questions of the day; its urgency is admitted by all schools of thought and all parties (except the feudal party), so that the reference to our being late is pointless and, coming as it does from Martynov, simply comical.
It is the Russian bourgeoisie who were “late” with what is really their own task of sweeping away all the remnants of the old order, and it is we who will have to make good this omission, as long as it has not been made good, as.
long as we have not obtained political liberty, as long as the position of the peasants continues to foster discontent among practically the whole of educated bourgeois society (as is the case in Russia), instead of fostering conserv­ ative self-satisfaction about the “indestructibility” of what is supposed to be the strongest bulwark against socialism (as is the case in the West where this self-satisfaction is displayed by all the parties of order from the agrarians and conservatives pur sang, the liberal and free-thinking bourgeois, to—without offence to Mr.
Chernov and the Veslnik Russkoy Revolyutsii1— even to the fashionable “critics of Marxism”* in the agrarian question).
Then, of course, those Russian Social-Democrats who trudge in the rear of the movement as a matter of principle, and who are only concerned with questions “promising palpable results,” * were also “late,” and because they were late in giving 1 2 1 The theoretical journal of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party; pub­ lished from June 1901 to March 1905; four numbers appeared.
—Ed.
2 Lenin alludes to the Social-Democrats of the group known as the definite directives on the agrarian question, these khvostisls have only succeeded in providing the non-Social-Democratic revolu­ tionaries with a very strong and reliable weapon.
As for e) the practical “unatlain&bility” of the demand for the restitution of the otrezki, this objection (which has been part­ icularly emphasised by Martynov) is one of the feeblest.
When wc have political liberty, the question of how the expropriation is to be carried out, in which concrete oases and how the com­ pensation, exchange, the division of the land, etc.
, are to be ar­ ranged, will be solved by the peasant committees ten times more easily than it was by the committees of the nobles which con­ sisted of representatives of a minority and acted in the interests of the minority.
Only those who are accustomed to underestimat­ ing the revolutionary initiative of the masses can attach any im­ portance to this objection.
At this point the fourth and last objection is raised.
If we are to count on the revolutionary initiative of the peasants and of­ fer them a maximum programme and not a minimum pro­ gramme, we must be consistent and demand either a “peasant” cherny peredel1 or a “bourgeois” nationalisation of the land.
“If,” writes Martynov, “we wanted to find a proper” (sic!) “class slogan for the mass of the small peasantry we should have to go a step further and advance the demand for cherny peredel, but then we should have to part with the Social-Demo­ cratic programme.
” This reasoning exposes the “Economist” very vividly and re­ minds us of the proverb about those who, when they are com­ pelled to pray, do it with such zeal that they smash their fore­ heads on the ground.
You have pronounced yourselves in favour of one of the de­ mands satisfying certain interests of a certain stratum of small “Economists.

point of view and adopt the point of view of that stratum!! It means nothing of the sort; only khvostists, only those who confuse the draw­ ing up of a programme that conforms to the broadly understood interests of a class with subservience to that class, can reason in this way.
Although we represent die proletariat, we never­ theless condemn the prejudice of backward proletarians, viz.
, that one must only fight for demands “promising palpable re­ sults.
” While supporting the progressive interests and demands of the peasants, we shall decisively reject their reactionary de­ mands.
Cherny peredel, one of the most vivid slogans of die old Narodniki, represents just such a combination of revolution­ ary and reactionary elements.
The Social-Democrats have stated dozens of times that they do not, with the stupidity of a certain unintelligent bird, throw the whole of Narodism overboard, but single out and take for their own its revolutionary and demo­ cratic elements.
The demand for cherny peredel expresses the reactionary utopian idea of generalising and perpetuating small-scale peasant production, but in addition (in addition to the utopian idea that the “peasantry” may serve as the vehicle of the socialist revolution) it expresses a revolutionary aspect, namely, the desire to sweep away, by means of a peasant in­ surrection, all the remnants of serfdom.
In our opinion the de­ mand for the restitution of the otrezki singles out, from all the ambiguous and contradictory demands of the peasant, precisely that which can have a revolutionary effect only in the direction which the whole evolution of society as taking, and which, con­ sequently, deserves the support of the proletariat.
Martynov’s invitation to us to “go further” will in reality only land us in the absurd position of having to define the “genuine” class slo­ gan of the peasantry from the standpoint of the present pre­ judices of the peasantry, and not from that of the properly in­ terpreted interests of the proletariat.
Nationalisation of the land* is a different matter.
This de­ mand (if it is interpreted in the bourgeois and not in the social­ ist sense) does actually “go further” than the demand for the restitution of the otrezki, and in principle wc fully endorse it It goes without saying that at a definite stage of -the revolution we shall not fail to advance it.
But our present programme is drawn up not only for the epoch of revolutionary insurrection, nor even so much for that epoch as for the epoch of political slavery, for the epoch that precedes political liberty.
In this epoch the demand for the nationalisation of the land is a much more imperfect expression of the immediate tasks of the demo­ cratic movement as a struggle against serfdom.
The de­ mand for the establishment of peasant committees and for the restitution of the otrezki directly kindles the class struggle in the rural districts, and consequently offers no opportunity for any experiments in the way of state socialism.
The demand for the nationalisation of the land, on the other hand, would, to a certain extent, serve to divert attention from the most striking manifestations and strongest survivals of serf­ dom.
That is why our agrarian programme can and must be ad­ vanced at once, as one of the means of stimulating the demo­ cratic movement among the peasants.
However, to advance the demand for land nationalisation under the autocracy, or even under a semi-constitutional monarchy, would be fundamentally wrong.
For as long as we lack firmly established and deep-rooted democratic institutions, such a demand would be more likely to turn our minds towards absurd experiments in state socialism, than to give a stimulus “to the free development of the class struggle in the countryside.
” 1 These are our reasons for thinking that our agrarian pro­ gramme, on the basis of the present social order, should not contain a maximum demand that would go beyond the demo­ cratic revision of the Peasant Reform.
* The demand for land nationalisation is quite valid in principle and quite suitable at certain stages, but it is politically inexpedient at the present moment 1 Kautsky very rightly remarks 'in one of his articles against Vollmar: “In England the advanced workers may demand the nationalisation of the land.
But what would be the result, in a militarist and police-ridden country like Germany, of all the land becoming crown property (eine Domäne) ? This sort of state socialism has been realised, to a considerable degree at least, in Mecklenburg.
1* (“Vollmar und der Staatssozialismus,” Die Neue Zeit, 1891-92, X.

) It is interesting to note that Nadezhdin, in his desire to reach a maximum, like land nationalisation, has lost his way (partly owing to his decision to confine himself in the programme “to demands which can be understood by the muzhik and which he re­ quires”).
Nadezhdin formulates the demand for land national­ isation in the following way: “the conversion of state, appanage, church and landlord land into the property of the people, into a national fund to be leased on long-term leases to the toiling peasants on the most advantageous terms.
” The “muzhik” will, no doubt, understand the demand, but the Social-Democrat cert­ ainly will not.
The demand for land nationalisation is a de­ mand of the Social-Democratic programme, valid in principle only as a bourgeois and not as a socialist measure, for, as So­ cialists, wc demand the natonalisation of all means of produc­ tion.
As long as we remain within the bounds of bourgeois so­ ciety we can only demand the transfer of ground rent to the state—a transfer which in itself, far from retarding, would ac­ celerate the capitalist evolution of agriculture.
It follows that, in «the first place, a Social-Democrat who supports bourgeois land nationalisation must make no exception for the peasants’ land as Nadezhdin does.
If we preserve private farming on the land, and only abolish private property in land, it wTould be down­ right reactionary to make an exception for the small proprietor.
In the second place, in the event of nationalisation, a Social-Democrat should decidedly oppose the leasing of land “to the toiling peasantry” in preference to capitalist farmers.
Such a preference would also be reactionary if the capitalist mode of production remained dominant or were preserved.
If a demo­ cratic country ever undertook to carry out bourgeois land nation­ alisation, it would be the duty of the proletariat of that country to show no preference either for small or big leaseholders, but to demand unconditionally that every leaseholder obey the pro­ tection of labour laws (maximum working hours, sanitary regu­ lations, etc.
) and the laws for the rational treatment of land and livestock.
In practice, the adoption of such a policy by the proletariat in the event of bourgeois nationalisation would, pf course, accelerate the victory of large-scale over small-scale pro-duction (in the same way as factory legislation accelerates the victory in industry).
The desire to be “understood by the muzhik” at all costs has landed Nadezhdin in a jungle of reactionary petty-bourgeois utopia.
Thus, the analysis of the objections raised against the demand for the restitution of the olrezki convinces us of die groundless­ ness of these objections.
We must put forward the demand for the democratic revision of the Peasant Reform, to be precise, the revision of the agrarian reform contained in it.
In order to determine the precise character, due limits and the manner of carrying out this revision we must demand the establishment of peasant committees which shall have the right to expropriate, buy out, exchange, etc.
, the olrezki, which are used as a means for preserving the survivals of serf economy.
February-March 1902.
21 Lenin II THE NATIONAL QUESTION IN OUR PROGRAMME* We have included in our draft Party programme the demand for a republic with a democratic constitution that would, among other things, assure “the recognition of the right of self-deter­ mination to all the nationalities contained in the state.
” As many did not find this point in our programme sufficiently clear, we took occasion, in speaking about the Manifesto of the Armenian Social-Democrats in issue No.
33, to explain the meaning of this point** in the following way: the Social-Democrats will always combat every attempt to influence national self-determination by violence or by any injustice from without.
But our unqualified recognition of the struggle for the right of self-determination does not commit us to supporting every demand for national self-determination.
Social-Democracy, as the party of the pro­ letariat, considers it to be its positive and principal task to ad­ vance the self-determination of the working class within each nationality rather than the self-determination of peoples and nationalities.
We must always and unconditionally strive to achieve the closest unity of the proletariat of all nationalities, and only in isolated and exceptional cases may we advance and actively support demands tending to set up a new class state or to substitute a loose federal unity for the complete political unity of a state.
This interpretation of our programme on the question of na­ tionalities has called forth a strong protest on the part of the Polish Socialist Party*** (P.
P.
S.
).
In an article entitled “The Attitude of Russian Social-Democracy on the Question of Na­ tionalities” {Przedsvit,1 March 1903), the P.
P.
S.
expresses in-1Duwn; the leading organ of the Polish Socialist Party.
The article was an unsigned programme article; that is why Lenin doc? not address himself to individuals but to the Party as a whole.
—Ed.
322 dignation at this “amazing” interpretation and at the ‘’haziness” of this “mysterious” self-determination of ours; it accuses us of being doctrinaire and of adhering to the “anarchist” view that “the worker is not concerned with anything but the com­ plete abolition of capitalism, because, we are told, language, nationality, culture, etc.
, are mere bourgeois inventions,” and so on.
It is worth considering this argument in detail, for it con­ tains nearly every one of the misunderstandings on the question of nationalities that are so usual and so current among Socialists.
What is it that makes our interpretation so “amazing”? WTiy does it deviate from the “literal” meaning? Does the recognition of the right of self-determination imply support of every de­ mand of every nationality for self-determination? The fact that we recognise the right of all citizens to form free associations does not commit us—Social-Democrats—to supporting every new association, nor does it prevent us from opposing the formation of a given association and agitating against it as inexpedient and unwise.
We even recognise the right of the Jesuits to carry on agitation freely, hut we fight against an alliance between the Jesuits and the proletarians (of course we do not fight by means of police measures).
Consequently, when Przedsvit says: “if the demand for the right of self-determination is taken literally (and that is how we have hitherto taken it) it would satisfy us com­ pletely”—it is quite obvious that it is precisely the P.
P.
S.
that deviates from the literal meaning of the programme.
From the formal point of view its conclusion is certainly illogical.
But we do not wish to confine ourselves to the formal verifi­ cation of our interpretation.
We shall go straight to the essence of the question: is it the bounden duty of the Social-Democrats always to demand national independence, or is it such only un­ der certain circumstances, and if so, under what circumstances? The P.
P.
S.
has always answered this question in favour of un­ qualified recognition; we are not in the least surprised, there­ fore, at the tenderness it displays towards the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries who demand a federal constitution and pro­ nounce themselves in favour of “the complete and unqualified recognition of national self-determination.
” {Rev^olyutsvonnaya 21* Rossiya, No.
18, “National Enslavement and Revolutionary So­ cialism.
”) Unfortunately, this is nothing more than one of those bourgeois-democratic phrases which for the hundredth and thous­ andth time reveal the real nature of the so-called party of the so-called Socialist-Revolutionaries.
That the P.
P.
S.
should suc­ cumb to the lure of these phrases and be seduced by them only proves how feeble is its connection with the class struggle of the proletariat, both as regards its theoretical understanding and its political practice.
But it is to the interests of this class strug­ gle that we must subordinate the demand for national self-determination.
It is this that makes all the difference between our approach and the bourgeois-democratic approach to the national question.
The bourgeois democrat (and the modern op­ portunist Socialist who walks in his footsteps) imagines that democracy eliminates the class struggle; and that is why he presents all his political demands in an abstract, sweeping “un­ qualified” way from the standpoint of tlie interests of the “whole people” or even from that of an eternal and absolute moral principle.
The Social-Democrat will always and everywhere ruth­ lessly expose this bourgeois illusion, whether it finds expression in an abstract idealist philosophy or in the unqualified demand for national independence.
If it is still necessary to prove that a Marxist can only recog­ nise the demand for national independence conditionally, on the condition we have indicated, then let us quote a writer who, from the Marxian point of view, has defended the Polish pro­ letarians who demand an independent Poland.
In 1896, in an article entitled “Finis Polonia1?” Kar) Kautsky wrote: “From the moment the proletariat tackles the Polish question it can­ not but pronounce itself in favour of the independence of Poland, and consequently it cannot but approve of every step which may be taken in this direction today, in so far as such a step would be consonant with the class interests of the international fighting proletariat.
This reservation, however,” Kautsky goes on to say, “must be made.
National independ­ ence is not so inseverably linked with the class interests of the fighting proletariat that it should be striven for unconditionally, under any cir­ cumstance.
1 Marx and Engels were most decidedly in favour of the unity and liberation of Italy, but this did not prevent them from pronounc-1 Our italics ing themselves, in 1859.
against an Italy allied with Napoleon III,” (Die Neue Zeit, XIV, 2, S.
520.
) As you sec, Kautsky definitely rejects the unconditional de­ mand for the indej>endence of nations, and definitely demands that the question be placed not merely on a historical but on a class basis.
And when we turn to the way Marx and Engels formulated the Polish question we shall see that that was the way they stated it from the outset.
Die Neue Rheinische Zeitung devoted much space to the Polish question; it not only definitely demanded the independence of Poland, but it demanded that Germany go to war with Russia for the independence of Poland.
But at the same time Marx violently attacked Ruge who had spoken in favour of Polish liberty in the Frankfort Parliament and had tried to solve the Polish problem exclusively with the aid of bourgeois-democratic phrases about “shameful in­ justice” and without any attempt to analyse it historically.
Marx was not like those pedants and philistines of tlie revolution who dread nothing more than “polemics” at a revolutionary moment in history.
Marx heaped pitiless scorn on the “humane” citizen Ruge, and, using the example of the oppression of the South of France by the North of France, proved to him that not every case of national oppression inspires a desire for independence that is justified from the point of view of democracy and of the proletariat.
Marx referred to special social circumstances which made “Poland the revolutionary section of Russia, Austria and Prussia.
.
.
.
Even the Polish nobility, although its foundations were still partly feudal, adhered, to the democratic agrarian revolution with unprecedented devotion.
Poland became the hearth of European democracy at a time when Germany was still submerged in the most vulgar constitutional and high-flown philosophical ideology.
.
.
.
As long as we (the Germans) help to oppress Poland, as long as we keep part of Poland riveted to Germany, we ourselves will remain riveted to Russia and to Russian policy, we shall be unable to free ourselves radically from our patriarchal feudal absolutism.
The creation of a democratic Poland is the first con­ dition for the creation of a democratic Germany.
” We have quoted these statements in such detail because they show graphically the historical circumstances under which the Polish question was formulated for international Social-Dem-ocracy, a formula which lasted for almost the whole of the second half of the nineteenth century.
To ignore the changed circumstances, and to go on advocating the old solution given by Marxism, is to be true to the letter and not to the spirit of the teaching, is to repeat by rote the old conclusions without being able to use the Marxian method in order to analyse the new political situation.
Then and now’—the age of the last bour­ geois revolutionary movements, and the age of desperate re­ action, of extreme tension of all forces on the eve of the proletarian revolution—are obviously different.
Then Poland as a whole was revolutionary, not only the peasantry, but even the bulk of the nobility.
The tradition of the struggle for national liberation was so strong and deep-rooted that after their defeat at home Poland’s best son® went wherever they could find a revolutionary class to support; the memory of Dombrowski and of Wroblewski is inseparably linked with the greatest movement of the proletariat in the nineteenth century, with the last—and let us hope the last unsuccessful—insurrection of the Paris workers.
Then complete victory for democracy in Europe was indeed impossible without the restoration of Poland.
Then Po­ land was indeed the bulwark of civilisation against tsarism; it was the vanguard of democracy.
Now the Polish ruling classes, the “szlachta” 1 in Germany and in Austria, the industrial and financial magnates in Russia have joined the ruling classes of the countries that oppress Poland—while the German and the Russian proletariat are fighting for their freedom side by side with the Polish proletariat, which has heroically assimilated the great traditions of the old revolutionary Poland.
Now, the ad­ vanced spokesmen of Marxism in the neighbouring country’, while attentively watching the political evolution of Europe and strongly sympathising with the heroic struggle of the Poles, nevertheless frankly admit that “St Petersburg has become a much more important revolutionary centre than Warsaw’, and the Russian revolutionary movement possesses today greater in­ ternational significance than the Polish movement.
” This is what Kautsky wrote as early as 1896, w'hen he defended the inclusion 1 Nobility.
-Frf.
Eng.
ed.
of the demand for the restoration of Poland in the programme of the Polish Social-Democrats.
And in 1902 Mehring, having studied the evolution of the Polish question since 1848.
arrived at the following conclusion: “If the Polish proletariat ever decided to inscribe on its banner the restoration of a Polish class state, which the ruling classes themselves do not want to hear about, it wTould be playing a historical farce; such things have occurred to the propertied classes (as, for instance, the Polish gentry in 1791), but ought never to occur to the working class.
If, on the other hand, this reactionary utopia is dragged in for the purpose of draw­ ing to the side of proletarian agitation those groups of the intelligentsia and of the petty bourgeoisie which still respond to some extent to na­ tionalist agitation, then that utopia is doubly to be condemned as the offspring of an unworthy opportunism which would sacrifice the pro­ found interests of the working class for the cheap and paltry successes of the moment.
Those interests categorically demand that in all the three countries that have divided Poland among themselves, the Polish workers should fight unreservedly side by side with their class comrades.
The times when a bourgeois revolution could create a free Poland have passed: today the resurrection of Poland is possible only as the consequence of a social rev­ olution, in the course of which the modem proletariat will break its chains.
” 1 We entirely subscribe to Mehring’s conclusions.
We shall only remark that the conclusion remains unassailable even if we do not go as far as Mehring in our arguments.
Certainly, the piesent situation in regard to the Polish question is radically different from that which obtained fifty years ago.
* But the present sit­ uation must not be regarded as permanent.
The antagonism of classes has undoubtedly relegated questions of nationality far to the background.
But we cannot categorically assert, without run­ ning the risk of becoming doctrinaire, that the temporary emergence of the national question on the forefront of the polit­ ical stage is impossible.
Undoubtedly, the restoration of Poland before <the fall of capitalism is highly improbable, but we can­ not assert that it is absolutely impossible, or that circumstances may not arise under which the Polish bourgeoisie will take the side of independence, etc.
And Russian Social-Democracy does not in the least intend to tie its hands.
In including the recogni­ tion of the right of self-determination in its programme, it takes 1 The passage quoted is from F.
Mehring’s preface to the ITorfcs of Marx and Engels of the period of 1841-50, German ed.
, 1902.
—Ed, into account all possible and even all imaginable combinations.
That programme does not preclude the Polish proletariat adopt­ ing the slogan of a free and independent Polish republic, even though the probability of its becoming a reality before the in­ troduction of socialism is infinitesimal.
The programme merely demands that a genuinely socialist party shall not corrupt pro­ letarian consciousness, or slur over the class struggle, or seduce the working class by bourgeois-democratic phrases, or disrupt the unity of the contemporary political struggle of the prolet­ ariat The whole point lies in this reservation, for only with this reservation do we recognise self-determination.
It is useless for the P.
P.
S.
to pretend that they differ from the Russian and German Social-Democrats in that the latter reject the right of self-determination, the right to aspire to a free and independent republic.
It is not tins, but the fact that they forget the class point of view, obscure it by chauvinism and disrupt the unity of the contemporary political struggle, that prevents us from regarding ithe P.
P.
S.
as a genuine Social-Democratic La­ bour Party.
This, for instance, is the way the P.
P.
S.
usually formulates the question: .
We cm only weaken tsarism by wresting Poland from it, the Russian comrades must overthrow it.
” Or again: .
after the overthrow of tsarism wre would simply take our fate into our own hands and secede from Rus­ sia.
” See to what monstrous conclusions this monstrous logic leads, even from the point of view of die programme demand for the restoration of Poland.
Because the restoration of Poland is one of the possible (but by no means unconditionally certain, as long as the bourgeoisie rules) consequences of democratic evolution, therefore, the Polish proletariat must not fight to­ gether with the Russian proletariat to overthrow tsarism, but “only” to weaken it by wresting Poland from it.
Because Rus­ sian tsarism is concluding a closer and closer alliance with the bourgeoisie and the governments of Germany, Austria, etc.
, therefore, the Polish proletariat must weaken its alliance with the proletariat of Russia, Germany, etc.
, by whose side it is now fighting against a common yoke.
This is nothing more nor less than sacrificing the most vital interests of the proletariat for the bourgeois-democratic interpretation of national independence.
The disintegration of Russia, which the P.
P.
S.
desires, in con­ trast with our aim of overthrowing tsarism, is and will remain a hollow phrase as long as economic evolution continues to unite the different parts of a political whole more and more closely and as long as the bourgeoisie of all countries unites more and more against its common enemy, the proletariat, and in support of its common ally, the tsar.
But the dispersion of the forces of the proletariat, which is now suffering under the yoke of tsarism, is the sad reality, the direct consequence of the error of the P.
P.
S.
, the direct result of its admiration for bour­ geois-democratic formulae.
In order to avoid seeing the dis­ integration of the proletariat, the P.
P.
S.
stoops to chauvinism and presents the views of the Russian Social-Democrats in the following way: “We [the Poles] must wait for the socialist rev­ olution, and until that time we must patiently bear national oppression.
” This is untrue.
The Russian Social-Democrats have never advised anything of the sort; on the contrary, they fight, and call upon the whole Russian proletariat to fight, against all manifestations of national oppression in Russia, they include in their programme not only complete equality of status for all languages, nationalities, etc.
, but actually the recognition of the right of every nationality to determine its own destiny.
While recognising this right, we subordinate our support of the de­ mand for national independence to the interests of the proletar­ ian struggle, and only a chauvinist can interpret our position as expressing the mistrust of a Russian towards a non-Russian: for in reality this position necessarily follows from the mistrust of the class conscious proletarian towards the bourgeoisie.
The P.
P.
S.
view is that the problem of nationality is exhausted by the contrast—“we” (Poles) and “they” (Germans, Russians, etc.
).
The Social-Democrat puts in the forefront the contrast— “we,” the proletarians, and ‘‘they,” the bourgeoisie.
“We,” the proletarians, have seen dozens of times how the bourgeoisie be­ trays the interests of freedom, country, language and nationality when it is confronted with the revolutionary proletariat.
We have seen the French bourgeoisie, at the moment of the greatest hum-illation and oppression of the French nation, surrender to the Prussians, we have seen the government of national defence be­ come a government of treason to the people, we have seen the bourgeoisie of an oppressed nation asking for the help of soldiers of the oppressing nation to crush its proletarian countrymen who had dared to stretch out a hand for power.
* And this be­ ing so, we shall always say to the Polish workers, undeterred by chauvinist and opportunist heckling: only the complete and most intimate alliance with the Russian proletariat can meet the re­ quirements of the political struggle that is now going on against tsarism, only this alliance can assure complete political and economic freedom.
What we have said of the Polish question is wholly applic­ able to every other national question.
The accursed history of tsarism has left us a legacy of tremendous estrangement between the working classes of the various nationalities which are op­ pressed by tsarism.
This estrangement is a very great evil, a very great obstacle in the struggle against tsarism, and we must not legalise this evil or sanctify this shameful state of affairs by establishing the ‘"principle” of the separateness of parties or “federation” of parties.
It is, of course, -simpler and easier to pursue the line of least resistance, and for everyone to make himself comfortable in his corner following the rule, “it is not my business,” as the Bund wants to do.
The more we realise the necessity for unity, the more firmly we are convinced that a concerted offensive against tsarism is impossible without com­ plete unity, the more obvious the necessity for a centralised organisation of the struggle becomes, as long as the present political system continues—the less inclined are we (to be satisfied with an “easy,” but specious and, at bottom, profoundly false solution of the problem.
As long as the harm of estrangement is not realised, and as long as the desire to put an end radic­ ally and at all costs to this mutual estrangement in the camp of the proletarian party is lacking, there is no need for such fig leaves as “federation,” nor is it any use undertaking to solve a problem which one of the “sides” really has no desire to solve; it is better to let the lessons of experience and the real movement convince them that centralism is essential for the success of the struggle of the proletarians of every nationality oppressed by tsarism against tsarism and against the interna­ tional bourgeoisie, which is becoming more and more united.
July 1903.
DOES THE JEWISH PROLETARIAT NEED AN “INDEPENDENT POLITICAL PARTY”? * No.
105 of Posledidye Izvestiyd1 (January 28 [15], 1903), the organ of the Foreign Committee of the General Jewish Labour League in Lithuania, Poland and Russia, published an article entitled “Concerning a Certain Manifesto” (viz.
y the manifesto issued by the Ekaterinoslav Committee of the R.

), con­ taining the following statement, which is as extraordinary as it is significant and, without exaggeration, is “pregnant with con­ sequences”: “The Jewish proletariat has formed itself [sic/] into an independent [src/] political party, the Bund.
” We had not known this.
This is something new.
Up to now the Bund has been a constituent part of the R.

, and in No.
106 of Posledniye Izvestiya we still (still!) find a statement of the Central Committee of the Bund, bearing the heading “R.

” It is true that at its recent Fourth Congress, the Bund decided to change its name (without staling that it would like to hear the opinion of the Russian comrades on the name a section of the R.

These relations have now been actually “introduced” by the Foreign Committee of the Bund, if that word can describe the fact that it has retired from the League of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad and has concluded a federal treaty with the latter.

and until the new form of relations with the Bund were settled, the Bund would remain a section of the R.

P.
But now, suddenly, we are told that the Jewish proletariat has already formed itself into an independent political party! We repeat—this is something new.
Equally new is the furious and foolish onslaught of the Foreign Committee of the Bund upon the Ekaterinoslav Com­ mittee.
We have at last [though unfortunately after much delay) received a copy of this manifesto, and we must say without hesitation that in attacking a manifesto like this, the Bund has undoubtedly taken a serious political step.
1 This step is fully in accord with proclaiming the Bund an independent political party and throws much light on the complexion and behaviour of this new party.
We regret that lack of space prevents us from reprinting the Ekaterinoslav manifesto in full (it would take up about two columns of Iskra),1 and we must confine ourselves to remark­ ing that this admirable manifesto excellently explains to the Jewish workers of the city of Ekaterinoslav (we shall presently explain why we have emphasised these words) the Social-Dem­ ocratic attitude towards Zionism and anti-Semitism.
In doing so the manifesto treats the sentiments, moods and desires of the Jewish workers so considerately—with such comradely consider­ ation—that it specially emphasises the necessity of fighting under the banner of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
“even for the preservation and further development of your [the manifesto addresses the Jewish workers] national culture," “even from the standpoint of purely national interests" (underlined and italicised in the manifesto).
In spite of this the F.
C.
of the Bund (we were on the point of saying the C.
C.
of the new party) violently attacks the mani­ festo for making no mention of the Bund.
That is the only crime the manifesto is guilty of, but a crime that is terrible 1 2 1 That is, of course, if the F.
C.
of the Bund expresses the views of the “Bund” as a whole on this question.
2 We intend to reprint, in full, the manifesto and the attack of the F.
C.
of the Bund, in a pamphlet which we are preparing for the press.
and unpardonable.
On the strength of it the Ekaterinoslav Com­ mittee is accused of lacking “political acumen.
” The Ekaterino-slav comrades are chastised for not “yet having digested the idea of the necessity for a separate organisation [a profound and significant idea!] of the farces [!!] of the Jewish proletariat,” for “still fostering the absurd hope of getting rid of it” (the Bund), for spreading the “no less dangerous fable” (no less dangerous than the Zionist fable) that anti-Semitism is con­ nected with the bourgeois strata and with their interests, and not with those of the working class.
That is why the Ekaterino­ slav Committee is advised to “abandon the harmful habit of hushing up the independent Jewish labour movement” and to “reconcile itself to the fact of the Bund’s existence.
” Now let us consider whether the Ekaterinoslav Committee has actually committed a crime, and whether it really should liave mentioned the Bund.
Both questions must be answered in the negative for the simple reason that ilhe manifesto is not ad­ dressed to the “Jewish workers” in general (as the F.
C.
B.
falsely stated), but to “the Jewish workers of the city of Ekaterinoslav 9 (the F.
C.
of the Bund forgot to quote these last words!).
The Bund has no organisation in Ekaterinoslav (besides, in the case of the South of Russia the Fourth Congress of the Bund passed a resolution not to organise separate committees of the Bund in those cities where the Jewish organisations are affiliated to tlie Party committee and where their needs can be satisfied with­ out their being separated from the committees).
Since the Jewish workers in Ekaterinoslav have not been organised under a spe­ cial committee, it follows that their movement (inseparable from the whole labour movement of that district) is in all respects under the direction of the Ekaterinoslav Committee, which thus directly subordinates them to the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
which must call upon them to work for the whole Party, and not for special sections of it.
It is clear that in these circumstances the Ekaterinoslav Committee wTas not obliged to mention the Bund; on the contrary, if it had presumed to advocate “the necessity for a separate organisation of the forces [it would rather and more probably have been an organisation of the impotence 11 of the Jewish proletariat’ (which is what ithe Bundists want), it would have committed a very bad mistake and a direct breach not only of the Party rules, but of the unity of the proletarian class struggle.
Further, the Ekaterinoslav Committee is accused of being in­ sufficiently “orientated” in the question of anti-Semitism.
The F.
C.
of the Bund displays a perfectly childish understanding of great social movements.
The Ekaterinoslav manifesto speaks of the internatioYial anti-Semitic movement of the last decades and remarks that “from Germany this movement spread to other countries and everywhere found adherents precisely among the bourgeoisie, and not among the working class strata of the population.
” “This is a no less dangerous fable” (than the Zionist fable), the F.
C.
B.
shouts out, quite angrily this time.
Anti-Semitism “has struck roots in the mass of the workers,” and to prove this the Bund, which is “orientated,” cites two facts: 1) the workers took part in the pogrom in Zhensto-khowo; and 2) the behaviour of 12 (twelve!) Christian workers in Zhitomir who scabbed on the strikers and threatened to “rip up all the Yids.
” Very weighty proof, indeed, especially the latter! The editors of Posledniye Izvestiya are so accustomed to operating with great strikes affecting five or ten workers that the action of twelve ignorant workers in Zhitomir is produced as evidence to prove which “strata of the population” are con­ nected with international anti-Semitism.
This is, indeed, magni­ ficent! If, instead of flying into a foolish and comic rage at the Ekaterinoslav Committee, the Bundists had pondered over this question and had consulted, let us say, Kautsky’s pamphlet ofi the social revolution, a Yiddish edition of which they themselves recently published,* they would have understood the connection 1 It is this task of “organising impotence” that the Bund serves when it uses such a phrase as “our comrades of the Christian working class organ­ isations/’ The phrase is as ridiculous as are all its attacks on the Ekate­ rinoslav Committee.
We have no knowledge of any “Christian” working class organisations.
The organisations belonging to the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
never distinguished their members according to their religion, never asked them about their religion and never will—even when the Bund will in actual fact have “formed itself into an independent political party.
” that undoubtedly exists between anti-Semitism and the interests of the bourgeois and not of the working class strata of the population.
If they had pondered a little more they might have realised that the social character of anti-Semitism today is not changed by the fact that dozens or even hundreds of unorgan­ ised workers, nine-tenths of whom are utterly ignorant, take part in a pogrom.
The Ekaterinnoslav Committee attacked (and very rightly at­ tacked) the Zionist fable about anti-Semitism being eternal; by making its angry comment the Bund has only confused the ques­ tion and planted in the minds of the Jewish workers ideas which will serve to obscure their class consciousness.
From the point of view’ of the fight carried on by the working class of Russia for political liberty and for socialism, the Bund’s attack on the Ekaterinoslav Committee is the acme of folly.
From the point of view of the Bund as “an independent political party,” it becomes intelligible: don’t dare organise “Jewish” workers with “Christian” wro-rkers! Don't dare address the Jewish workers in the name of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
or of its committee directly, “avoiding other departments,” avoiding the Bund, without mentioning the Bund! And this profoundly regrettable fact is not accidental.
From the moment you demanded “federation” instead of autonomy in matters concerning the Jewish proletariat you were compelled to proclaim the Bund an “independent political party” in order to carry out this principle of federation at all costs.
But by pro­ claiming the Bund to be an independent political party you reduce your fundamental error in the question of nationalities to an absurdity in a way which inevitably and necessarily be­ comes the starting point far a change in ithe views of the Jewish proletariat and of Jewish Social-Democrats in general.
The “autonomy” established under the rules adopted in 1898 gave the Jewish labour movement all it needed: propaganda and agitation in Yiddish, its own literature and congresses, permis­ sion to advance special demands in accordance with the common Social-Democratic programme, and the satisfaction of local needs and demands arising out of the peculiarities of Jewish life.
On all other things there must be complete fusion with the Russian proletariat, in the interests of the proletariat of Russia as a whole.
As for the fear of being “steam-rollered” in the event of such fusion, the very nature of the case makes it groundless, because autonomy will serve as a guarantee against all “steam-rolling” on all specifically Jewish matters^ while on all matters relating to the fight against tsarism, the fight against the bourgeoisie of Russia as a whole, we must act as a single and centralised fighting organisation, we must have behind us the whole of the proletariat, without distinction of language or nationality, a proletariat whose unity is cemented by having con­ stantly to solve problems of theory and practice, of tactics and organisation, in common; we must not set up organisations that would march separately, each along its own track, we must not weaken our offensive by breaking up into a number of independ­ ent political parties, we must not breed estrangement and isola­ tion and then have to cure, with the aid of those famous “fed­ eration” plasters, an artificially inoculated disease.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE R.
S.
D.
L P.
* This account is intended exclusively for personal friends, so that reading it without the permission of the author (Lenin) is equivalent to reading private letters** To enable the reader to understand what follows, I shall first of all state who was present at the Congress, although this will be anticipating somewhat.
The delegates at the Congress had fifty-one decisive votes (thirty-three with one vote each and nine with two each, that is, nine “double votes”).
In addition, there were ten delegates with consultative votes, if I am not mistaken.
This makes a total of fifty-two delegates.
The political grouping of the votes, as was shown during .
the whole course of the Con­ gress, was as follow's: decisive votes—five Bundists, three Ra-bocheye Dyelo-ists (two from the League of Russian Social-Dem­ ocrats Abroad and one from the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle***), four Yuzhny Rabochy-ists* * * * (itwo from the Yuzhny Rabochy group and two from the Kharkov Committee which was entirely at one with Yuzhny Rabochy), six irresolute waverers (the “Marsh” as the Iskra-ists called them, jokingly, of course), and about thirty-three Iskra-ists more or less firm and consistent in their Iskra ism.
These thirty-three Iskra-ists, when they remained united, always decided the outcome of every issue at the Congress, but they split into two sub-groups, the final split taking place only towards the end of the Congress.
One sub­ group, about nine votes—the Iskra-ists of the “soft,” or more correctly, the “zigzag” line (or feminine line, as some wits put it, not without reason), Iskra-ists who (as will appear further on) were in favour of fair play, of a resultant .
.
.
etc.
—and about twenty-four votes of Iskra-ists of the firm line who ad­ 341 vocated consistent Iskra-ism in tactics and in the personnel of the central institutions of the Party.
I repeat, this group only assumed final shape and became fully apparent post factum, towards the end of the Congress (which held forty sessions!), and I am anticipating in out­ lining this group at the outset.
I must also make the reservation that this grouping gives only the approximate number of votes cast because on certain minor issues (and on one occasion—in the case of “equal status of languages,” of which more later— on a major issue) the votes were dispersed, there were absten­ tions, the groups got mixed up, etc.
The composition of the Congress had been determined before­ hand by the Organisation Committee * which, according to the standing orders of the Congress,** was entitled to invite to the Congress whomever it thought fit, with a consultative vote.
As soon as the Congress met it elected a credentials commission, and all business concerning the personnel of the Congress was handed over to this commission.
*** (Parenthetically, the com­ mission included a Bundist who tried to wear out all the mem­ bers of the commission by keeping them up till 3 a.
m.
and still “reserving his opinion” on every issue,) The Congress began with all the Iskra people working in peace and harmony; of course there were always different shades of opinion among them, but these shades did not come out on the surface as political dissensions.
Incidentally, let us point out at once that the split among the /s&ra-ists was one of the principal political results of the Congress, and whoever wishes to become familiar with the subject must pay particular attention to all the episodes that were connected, however re­ motely, with this split.
A rather important act at the very beginning of the Congress was the election of a bureau or presidium, Martov was in favour of electing nine persons who would appoint a bureau of three for every session; he wanted these nine to include even a Bund­ ist.
I was in favour of electing not more than three for the duration of the Congress, three people who would be able to keep the Congress “in hand.
” The three elected were: Plekhanov, myself and Comrade T (an Iskra-ist of the firm Une and a mem­ ber of the 0.
C.
,1 we shall have to mention him often in what fallows).
The last named, however, only obtained a small majority over a member of the Yuzhny Rabochy group (who was also a member of the O.
C.
).
The disagreement between Martov and me about the bureau (a disagreement which is sig­ nificant in the light of what follows) did not, however, result in any split or conflict: in one way or another the matter was settled peacefully, “as between friends,” as matters were usually settled in the Iskra organisation and on the editorial board of Iskra.
A meeting (secret, and informal, of course) of the Iskra or­ ganisation concerning its mandates at the Congress was also held at the beginning of the Congress, This, too, resulted in a peaceful, “amicable” settlement.
The only reason I draw atten­ tion to this meeting is because I think it is characteristic, first, that at the beginning of the Congress the Iskra-isls worked in harmony, and, secondly, that they decided to appeal to the author­ ity of the Iskra organisation (or, more precisely, to the mem­ bers of the Iskra organisation present at the Congress) in doubt­ ful and controversial cases; of course, the decisions of these meetings were not binding, since the rule was: “imperative mandates are abolished”—everyone may and must vote at the Congress in accordance with his free personal conviction, with­ out submitting to any organisation whatever—this rule, I say, was recognised by all the /sira-ists, and was proclaimed by the chairman at ths opening of nearly every one of the Iskra meet­ ings.
I I 1 ’ To proceed.
The first incident at the Congress which revealed the fact that all was not well among the /sinr-ists, and which became the starting point of the final drama (or tragi-comcdy?), was the notorious “O.
C.
incident.
” This incident must be dealt with in some detail: it happened at the stage when the Congress was still busy constituting itself, when the standing orders of the Congress were still under discussion (a business which, by the way, took up a tremendous amount of time because of the 1 Organisation Committee.
—Ed.
Eng.
cd.
obstruction of the Bundists who intentionally or unintentionally lost no opportunity .
.
.
of holding it up whenever and which­ ever way they could).
The substance of the O.
C.
incident was this: before the Congress met, the O.
C.
had turned down the protest of Borba* (the Borba group), which demanded that it be admitted to the Congress, and supported this decision on the credentials commission; but at the Congress this very O.
C.
sud­ denly announced that it was going to invite Ryazanov with a consultative vote.
This is how the incident occurred; Before the sessions of the Congress had begun Martov had confidentially told me that a member of the Iskra organisation, who was also a member of the O.
C.
(let us call him N), had decided to insist in the O.
C.
on inviting, with a consultative vote, a person 1 whom Martov himself could only describe as a “turncoat.
” (That person had indeed gravitated towards Iskra at one time, only to desert a few weeks later to Rabocheye Dyelo, although the latter at that time was in a state of utter decay.
) Martov and I discusser! die matter; both of us were indignant that a member of the Iskra organisation should have done such a thing without deeming it necessary to consult the organisation, although fully aware, of course (for Martov had warned Com­ rade N), that his behaviour was a slap in the face for Iskra, N actually introduced his motion in the O.
C.
, but it was turned down owing to the indignant protest of Comrade T who gave a full description of the political fickleness of this “turncoat.
” It is significant that even then Martov, in spite of his former ex­ cellent personal relations, said he was incapable of remaining on speaking terms with N, so astounded was he by the latter’s behaviour.
N’s desire to put spokes in the wheel of Iskra also found expression in the O.
C.
passing, with liis support, a vote of censure on the editorial board of Iskra1 2; the censure, it is true, referred to a very minor case; nevertheless, it roused Mar­ tov to very great indignation.
Reports from Russia, which were also conveyed to me by Martov, indicated that N had displayed 1Y.

Steklov.
—-Ed, 2 For a more detailed account of this incident see Lenin’s ‘‘Report to the Congress of the League,” in the present volume.
—Ed, a tendency to spread rumours about dissensions between the Iskra-isis in Russia and those abroad.
All this tended to make the Iskra-ists very suspicious of N, and on top of all this the fol­ lowing incident occurred.
The O.
C.
had turned down the protest of Borba; the members of the O.
C.
(T and N) were called be­ fore the credentials commission and both (including NU!) pro­ nounced themselves very decidedly against Borba.
In spite of this the O.
C.
met unexpectedly, right by “the window,” during an interval in the morning session of the Congress, and decided to invite Ryazanov with a consultative vote! N was in favour of inviting him.
T, of course, was opposed, and declared that after the question of the composition of the Congress had been sub­ mitted to a special credentials commission elected by the Con­ gress, the decisions of the O.
C.
were ultra vires.
The Yuzhny Ra-bochy members of the O.
C.
, plus the Bundist, plus N, of course, outvoted Comrade T and the motion was passed in the O.
C.
T informed the editorial board of Iskra, which, of course, unanimously decided (not all were present, but Martov and Zasulich were) to challenge the O.
C.
at the Congress, for many Iskra-isls had publicly pronounced themselves against Borba at the Congress, and retreat on the issue was impossible.
When (in the afternoon session) the O.
C.
announced its deci­ sion to the Congress, T entered his protest.
The Yuzhny Rabo-chy member 1 of the O.
C.
furiously attacked T, accusing him of committing a breach of discipline (!) because the O.
C.
had decided not to divulge this at the Congress (sic!).
Naturally, we (Plekhanov, Martov and I) came down on the O.
C.
with all our might and accused it of reviving imperative mandates, of infringing upon the sovereignty of the Congress, etc.
The Con­ gress took our side, the O.
C.
was defeated, and a resolution was passed depriving the O.
C.
, as a body, of the right to modify the composition of the Congress.
Such was the “O.
C.
incident.
” In the first place it finally un­ dermined, in the minds of many Iskra-ists, all political con­ fidence in N (while strengthening their confidence in T); in the second place, it not only proved, but graphically showed hpw Y.
Levin,—Ed, shaky the Iskra-ist line of policy was, even in.
a central institu­ tion like the O.
C.
which was supposed to be one hundred per cent Iskra-ist.
It became clear that the O.
C.
consisted, besides a Bundist, of: 1) the Yuzhny Rabochy-\sts with a policy of their own; 2)“/s£ra-ists who were ashamed of being Iskra-ists”1 ; and only a section 3) of Iskra-ists who were not ashamed of being such.
2 When the Yuzhny RabochyAsts expressed the desire to discuss the regrettable incident with the editorial board of Iskra (in private, of course)—Comrade N, it is important to note this, expressed no desire to do so at the time—-the editorial board did discuss the matter with the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists, and I plainly told them that the Congress had revealed the import­ ant political fact that the Party contained many Iskra-ists who were ashamed of being Iskra-ists and capable, just to spite Iskra, of playing a trick like inviting Ryazanov.
I was so in­ dignant al the trick N had played after he had spoken in the commission against Borba that I said publicly, at the Con­ gress: “Comrades who have attended foreign congresses know what a storm of indignation is always raised against those who say one thing in committee and another thing on the floor of the Congress.
” An Iskra-\s>\.
who was afraid of being “re­ proached” by the Bundists with being the “nominee of Iskra” and who for no other reason played political tricks on Iskra, v>8L3 incapable, of course, of inspiring any confidence.
The general mistrust the Iskra-ists entertained towards N in­ creased to a tremendous degree when Martov’s attempt to dis­ cuss the matter with N resulted in N’s announcement that he had resigned from the “Iskra” organisation!! From that moment N’s “case” was taken up by the Iskra organisation, the members of which were indignant at this manner of resigning; the organ­ isation met four times to discuss the question.
These meetings, especially the last of them, were exceedingly important, because it was at these meetings that the split among the /sfcra-ists took shape, mainly on the issue of the composition of the C.
C.
But before I go on to relate what occurred at these meetings 1 E.

—Ed, (private and informal, I must repeat) of the Iskra organisation, I shall say something about the work of the Congress.
The work had been proceeding harmoniously in the sense that all the ZsAraists acted in unanimity on the first point of the agenda (the place of the Bund in the Party), on the second point (pro­ gramme) and on the third point (the establishment of a C.
OJ of the Party).
Agieement within the Iskra camp ensured a con­ siderable, united majority at the Congress (a compact majority, as the Bundists put it regretfully!) although the “irresolute” (“Marsh”) and the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists often showed their true colours on minor points by their complete lack of stability.
It became more and more evident that the not quite Iskra elements of the Congress had formed a political group.
Let me return to the meetings of the Iskra organisation.
At the first meeting it was decided to ask N for an explanation, leaving it to him to choose the members of the Iskra organisa­ tion to whom he would like to make this explanation.
I pro­ tested point blank against putting the question in this way and demanded that the political issue (the Zs/cra-ists’ lack of political confidence in N at the present Congress) should be kept dis­ tinct from the personal issue (to appoint a commission to en­ quire into the reasons for N’s strange behaviour).
At the second meeting it was reported that N did not wish to give explanations in the presence of T, although he did not intend to say any­ thing about T personally.
I protested again, refusing to associate myself with a procedure which permitted someone who was not a member of the organisation to remove, be it only for a second, a member who was not to be the subject of the discussion.
I re­ garded this as an unworthy game and a slap in the face for the organisation on the part of N: N did not have sufficient con­ fidence in the organisation to allow it to determine the conditions under which the explanation was to be given! It was at the third meeting that N gave his explanation, which, however, failed to satisfy the majority of those present.
At the fourth meeting all tire Iskra-ists were present, but that meeting was preceded by a number of important episodes at the Congress.

In the first place it is worth mentioning the episode that oc­ curred in connection with the “equal status of languages.
” The subject under discussion was the programme, and the formula­ tion of the demand for the equality and equal status of lang­ uages.
* (Each point of the programme was discussed and passed separately, the Bundists carrying on a desperate obstruction, so that almost two-thirds of the time of the Congress was taken up by the discussion of the programme!) The Bundists succeeded in causing the ranks of the Iskra-ists ;to waver and induced some of them to believe that Iskra was opposed to the “equal status of languages”—while in reality the editorial board of Iskra was merely opposed -to a formula which it believed to be illiterate, absurd and superfluous.
The fight was a healed one, the Con­ gress divided equally, into two equal halves (a few abstained from voting): Iskra (and the editorial board of Iskra) had on its side 23 votes (or perhaps 23 to 25; I do not remember the exact figure) and as many against it.
The discussion then had to be postponed, and the question referred to a committee.
The committee arrived at a formula which was adopted by the Con­ gress unanimously.
The incident in connection with the equal status of languages is important because it again revealed the instability of Iskra-ism, it finally revealed the instability of the irresolute (if I am not mistaken it wT&s on this occasion, and by the Iskra-ists of the Martov persuasion, that they were christ­ ened the “Marsh”!) and of the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists who were all against Iskra.
Passion ran high and harsh words were hurled without number at the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists by the Iskra-ists, especially by the Martovists.
During the interval, one of the “leaders”1 of the Martovists almost came to blows with the Yuzhny Rabochy-isls and I hastened to re-open the session (on the insistence of Plekhanov, who feared there would be a fight).
It is important to note that even among these twenty-three staunch Iskra-ists, the Martovists (i.
e.
, the Iskra-i&ts who afterwards followed Martov) were in the minority.
The other episode was the fight about point 1 of the “rules of the Party.
” This was the fifth item on the Tagesordnung* * and * L.
D.
Trotsky.
— came up towards the end of the Congress.
The following had been passed: item 1—resolution against federalism*; item 2—the programme; item 3—the recognition of Iskra as the central or­ gan of the Party 2; item 4—the “delegates’ reports” were heard, or rather some of them, the rest being referred to a committee, for it became apparent that the Congress had no time left (both the funds and the people having been exhausted).
Point 1 of the rules defined what was meant by the term, member of the Party.
The definition I proposed in my draft was as follows: “A member of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
is one who re­ cognises its programme and supports the Party materially as well as by personal participation in one of the organisations of the Party” Martov, on the other hand, moved to substitute for the words underlined the words: working under the control and guidance of one of the organisations of the Party.
My formula was supported by Plekhanov, Martov’s was supported by the other members of the editorial board.
(Axelrod spoke for them at the Congress.
) We insisted that membership of the Party must be given a narrow definition so as to distinguish those who worked from those who talked, so as to get rid of chaos in the matter of organisation, to get rid of the monstrosity and absurdity of having organisations which consisted of mem­ bers of the Party, but which were not Party organisations, etc.
Martov was in favour of widening the Party and spoke of a 1 It is very important to hear in mind that the Tagesordnung [agenda— Ed.
] of the Congress adopted on my report to the O.
C.
and approved by the Congress included as two separate items: 3) “the establishment of a central organ of the Party, or the endorsement of such,” and 24) “elections to the central institutions of the Party.
” When one of the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists asked on item 3 what we were endorsing, was it the title? for we did not yet know who the editors would be!—Martov took the floor and ex­ plained that we were endorsing the policy of Iskra, irrespective of persons, that this did not prejudice the question of who was to be included in the editorial board, for the elections to the central institutions would take place under item 24, and all imperative mandates had been abolished.
This utterance of Martov’s (on Stem 3, before the split among the Iskra-ists) is exceedingly significant.
The explanation given by Martov was entirely in accord with the way we all interpreted items 3 and 24 of the Tagesordnung, After item 3, Martov in his speeches more than once used the phrase: ex-members of the editorial board of Iskra, broad class movement which demanded a broad—a diffuse— organisation, etc.
It is odd that in defending their views nearly all the supporters of Martov referred to IF hat Is To Be Done?.
Plekhanov vehemently opposed Martov and pointed out that the Jaures-ist wording proposed by the latter opened the door for opportunists who wanted nothing better than to be in die Party without belonging to an organisation.
I maintained that “under the control and guidance” actually meant nothing more nor less than absence oj any control and guidance.
Martov won the point; his formula was adopted (by a majority of 28 against 23, or something like that, 1 do not remember exactly) thanks to the Bundists, who, of course, saw the loophole at once, and gave all their five votes to secure the “greater evil” (these were the very words uttered by one of the Rabocheye Dyelo delegates in giving his reasons for voting for Martov!*).
The heated dis­ pute around point 1 of the rules and the voting on it served once more to bring out die political grouping at the Congress, and strikingly revealed that the Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo were in a position to decide the fate of every resolution by sup­ porting the minority of the Iskra-iste against die majority.
The last (fourth) meeting of the Iskra organisation took place after the dispute and the voting on point 1 of the rules.
By now the dissensions among the Iskra-ists over the question of who was to be included in the C.
C.
1 had become fully apparent, and led to a split in their ranks: a part was in favour of an Iskraist C.
C.
(in view of die dissolution of the Iskra organisa­ tion and of die Emancipation of Labour group and the necessity of completing Iskra's work), the otiier part was in favour of let­ ting the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists in and of allowing the Iskra-ists of the “zigzag line” to predominate.
Some were absolutely op­ posed to N’s candidature, others were in favour of it.
It was to make one last attempt to come to an agreement that the meet­ ing of sixteen (members of die Iskra organisation, the con­ sultative votes, too, being counted, as I have already said) was called.
The voting gave the following results: nine votes against N, four in favour, the rest abstaining.
After that the majority 1 Central Committee.
—Ed.
ed.
who, in spite of everything, wished to avoid war with the minor­ ity, proposed a conciliatory list of five persons including one Yuzhny Rabochy-ist (favoured by the minority) and one milit­ ant member of the minority.
The others proposed were consist­ ent Iskra-isls (one of whom—this is important—took no part in the squabble at the Congress except towards the very end, and was virtually unbiassed, while the other two took no part what­ ever in the squabbles and were quite unbiassed as far as per­ sonalities were concerned).
Ten hands were raised for this list (one more was added afterwards, making eleven), and only one against (Martov alone!), the rest abstained! Thus, the con­ ciliatory list was defeated by Martov.
After that two other “militant” lists, one from each side, were put to the vote, but both were defeated.
* Thus, at the last meeting of the Iskra organisation the Martov­ ists were left in a minority on both issues, and in spite of this, when one of the majority (unbiassed, the chairman1) approached them after the meeting ito make a last attempt at conciliation, they declared war.
The calculation of the Martovists was clear and sound; the Bundists and the Rabocheye Dyelo-iste were certain to support the list of the zigzag line, because after a month of the Con­ gress every issue was so clear, every personality stood out so plainly, that not a single member of the Congress could have any difficulty in choosing which was to be preferred or which of the evils was the lesser one.
And, of course, for the Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo, the zigzag /jfAra ists were always the lesser evil, and will always be such.
After the meeting of the sixteen, when the /stra-ists had fi­ nally split, and war had been declared between the two sides, the two parties into which the Congress had split began to hold meetings, i.
e.
, private, unofficial gatherings of all those who held the same views.
At first the number of Iskra-ists of the consist­ ent line to meet together was nine (nine out of sixteen), after­ wards fifteen, afterwards twenty-four, if we count decisive votes and not individuals.
This rapid increase is accounted for by the xYi A.
Noskov (Glebov).
—Ed.
fact that the lists of candidates for the C.
C.
were already be­ ing circulated and the Martovist list utterly repelled the great majority of the /sira-ists by its flabbiness: the candidates pro­ posed by Martov had all made a very bad impression at the Con­ gress (wriggling, lack of character, tactlessness, etc.
).
That was the first point; the second point was that the explanation given to the Iskra-ists of what took place in the Iskra organisation in a great number of cases brought them over to die side of the majority, while Martov’s inability to maintain a definite polit­ ical line became apparent to all.
Consequently, twenty-four votes were easily and quickly united in consistent Zsira-ist tactics—on a list of candidates for die C.
C.
and on the election of the three editors (instead of endorsing the old, unworkable and diffuse group of six).
In the meantime the Congress had finished the discussion of die rules, Martov and Co.
having once more (and not only once but several times) beaten the Iskra-isi majority with the honour­ able support of the Bund and “Rabocheye Dyelo” as for in­ stance on the question of co-opting members for the centres* (the Congress settled the question in the Martov spirit).
Although vitiated in this way, the rules as a whole received the votes of all the Iskra-iste and of die whole Congress.
But after the general rules had been adopted we passed to the rules of the Bund, and die Congress by an overwhelming majority rejected the proposal of the Bund (that the Bund be (recognised as the sole representative of the Jewish proletariat in the Party).
The Bund found itself, I believe, nearly alone against the whole Congress.
The Bundists then left the Congress and declared their secession from the Party.
The Martovists lost five trusty allies! The Rabocheye Dyelo delegates also withdrew** after the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democrats Abroad had been recognised as the only Party organisation abroad.
*** The Mar­ tovists lost two more trusty allies! The Congress was left with 44 (51—7) decisive votes, and the consistent Iskra-isXz be­ came the majority (24); the coalition of the Martovists, the Yuzhny RabochyAste and the “Marsh” could now muster only 20 votes.
The zigzag-line Iskra-iste could do nothing but submit, since the Iskra-isls of the firm line had submitted without a murmur when Martov, by forming a coalition with the Bund, had beaten and defeated them.
But the Martovists had gone so far that in­ stead of submitting they preferred a row and a split.
The row came when the question of endorsing the old edit­ orial board was raised, for a statement on the part of one of the editors was enough to compel the Congress to examine the whole question of the personnel of tlic C.
O.
and not to res­ trict itself merely to endorsing it.
The refusal to elect the C.
O.
and the C.
C.
was a step towards the split.
First about the election of the editorial board.
As I have said, item 24 of the Tagesbrdnung was: elections to the central in­ stitutions of the Parly.
, In my comments on the Tagesordnun^g (these comments were known to all the “ I sk racists long before the Congress, and to all the delegates at the Congress), there was the following marginal note: election of three persons to the C.
O.
and three to the C.
C.
Consequently, it is beyond all doubt that the demand for the election of three came from the editor­ ial board itself, and no member of that board had opposed it.
Even Martov and another Martovist leader 1 had advocated these “two groups of three” to a number of delegates before the open­ ing of the Congress.
I, personally, several weeks before the Congress, had told Starover and Martov that at the Congress I would demand the election of the editorial board; I agreed to the election of two groups of three, on the understanding that the editorial group might either co-opt seven (or more) people or remain as it was.
(I made a special reservation about the latter alternative.
) Star-over had even said in so many words that the three meant: Plekhanov-{-Martov-f-Lenin, and I agreed with him—so clear had it always been to everyone that only people like these could be elected to conduct the paper.
Only he who had become em­ bittered, offended and who had lost his head in the struggle at the Congress could post factum attack the expediency and workability of such a group of three.
The old group of six was 1L.
D.
Trotsky.
—Ed.
23 Lenin H so unworkable that it had not met in full once in the course of three years; this seems incredible, but it is a a fact.
Not one of the forty-five issues of Iskra was made up (in the editorial-technical sense) by anyone but Martov or Lenin.
And not once was a 6/g theoretical question raised by anyone but Plekhanov.
Axelrod did no work at all (0 —no articles in Zarya and three or four in all the forty-five issues of Iskra).
Zasulich and Star-over confined themselves to contributing articles and giving advice, but they never did any editorial work in the strict sense of the word.
After a month’s work of the Congress, the persons who ought to be elected to be political leaders, to the centre— was as clear as daylight to every member of the Congress.
To bring before the Congress a proposal to endorse the old editorial board was absurd, provocative, and could only lead to a row.
Absurd because it was aimless.
Even if the six were endorsed, one of them (myself, for instance) would have demanded that the board be overhauled, that the mutual relations between its members be investigated, and the Congress would have been obliged to begin all over again.
It was provocative and could only lead to a row because a re­ fusal to endorse could only be interpreted as an affront, while a new election implied no offence whatever.
If the C.
C.
could be elected, why not the C.
O.
? Since no one proposed that the O.
C.
be endorsed—there should have been no talk of endorsing the old editorial board.
But, of course, by demanding that the old editorial board be endorsed, the Martovists provoked the Congress to protest; the protest was received as an affront, as an insult, an intention to kick out, to oust.
.
• • The editors left the Congress hall when the question of elect­ ing or endorsing was being discussed.
After a furious and heated debate the Congress resolved*, that, the old editorial board be not endorsed.
1 1 One of the Martovists spoke on this occasion in such a way that when he had finished, a delegate shouted to the secretary: “Put a tear instead of a period at the end of his speech in the minutes!” It was the inhabit­ ants of the “Marsh” who most heatedly supported the old editorial board.
It was only after this resolution was passed that the ex­ members of the editorial board returned to the meeting room.
Martov then rose and, in his own name and in that of his col­ leagues, declined election, with a lot of bloodcurdling stuff about “a state of siege in the Party” (for Ministers who had failed to secure election?) and about “exceptional laws against individuals and groups” (for the sort of individual who, speak­ ing in the name of Iskra, tried to smuggle Ryazanov into the Congress, and who said one thing in committee and another at the Congress?).
I replied to him and pointed to the incredible confusion of political conceptions which had led to the protest against elec­ tions and against the Congress overhauling the boards of of­ ficials of the Party.
The ballot resulted in the election of Plekhanov, Martov and Lenin; but Martov again declined.
Koltsov (who received three votes) also declined.
The Congress then passed a resolution authorising the two members of the editorial board of the C.
O.
to co-opt a third, if they found a suitable person.
After that, three members were elected to the C.
C.
, the teller 1 announcing the name of only one of them to the Congress; a fifth member 2 * was elected to the Council of the Party (by secret ballot).
The Martovists, followed by the whole of the “Marsh,” did not hand in their ballot papers, but handed in a written state­ ment to the bureau.
This was an obvious step towards a split, towards wrecking the Congress, towards refusing to recognise the Party.
But when one of the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists 8 stated in so many w ords that he doubted (sic!) the legality of the decisions of the Congress, Martow felt ashamed and repudiated him by publicly stating that he entertained no doubt as to the legality of the decisions.
Unfortunately, die acts and behaviour of Martov (and of the Martovists) were not in accord with his fine and loyal words.

After that, the Congress referred the question of publishing die minutes to a “minutes committee” and passed eleven resolu­ tions on tactical questions, viz.
, 1) on demonstrations; 2) on the trade union movement; 3) on work among the dissenters; 4) on work among the students; 5) on the line of conduct to be pursued under police examination; 6) on shop stewards; 7) on the International Congress of 1904 in Amsterdam; 8) on the liberals (moved by Starover) ; 9) on the liberals (moved by Plekhanov); 10) on the Socialist-Revolutionaries; 11) on Party literature.
Then, after a short speech by the chairman who impressed upon everyone die binding character of the decisions of the Con­ gress, the Congress was closed.
Reviewing the behaviour of the Martovisls after the Congress, their refusal to work on the C.
O.
(which the editorial board had officially asked them to do), their refusal to work for the C.
C.
, their propaganda of a boycott *—the only thing I can say is that it was a senseless attempt, unwrorthy of Party members, to disrupt the unity of the Party, and why? Only because they were dissatisfied with the composition of the central institutions, for, objectively speaking, this was the only point on which we dis­ agreed; the subjective judgments (such as affront, insult, kick­ ing-out, elimination, besmirching, etc.
, etc.
) were the fruits of offended dignity and a morbid imagination.
This morbid imagination and offended dignity lead directly to the most disgraceful scandalmongering.
Before anything is known or seen of the conduct of the new centres rumours are circulated to the effect that they are “unworkable,” rumours about the “spiked gloves” of Ivan Ivanovich or the “fist” of Ivan Nikiforovich,1 and so on.
To try to prove the “unw-orkability” of the centres by boy­ cotting them is an unprecedented and unheard-of breach of Party duty, and no sophistry can conceal this: the boycott is a step towards breaking up the Party.

Russian Social-Democracy is passing through a difficult final period of transition from the circle state to the Party stale, from philistinism to the appreciation of revolutionary duty, from action by scandal and circle pressure to discipline.
Whoever values Party work and action in the interests of the Social-Democratic labour movement will not stoop to such pit­ iful sophistry as the “justified” and “loyal” boycott of the centres, nor allow the cause to suffer, nor the work to be held up because of the discontent of a dozen individuals who resent the fact that the people elected to the centres were not the people they wanted to be elected, nor will he allow the officials of the Party to be influenced privately and secretly by means of threats of non-collaboration, by means of boycott, by means of cutting off funds,* by means of scandals and lying tales.

SPEECHES DELIVERED AT THE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE R.

P.
* A.
Report on the Party Rules Lenin (reporter**) explains the draft rules proposed by him.
The fundamental idea of the rules is Hie division of functions.
Thus, to take an example, the division into two centres is not the result of the separation of these centres geographically (Russia and abroad), but the logical consequence of the division of functions^ The Central Committee performs the function of practical leadership, the central organ, that of ideological lead­ ership.
To unify the activity of these two centres, to avoid their acting at cross purposes and, partly, in order to settle disputes, a Council is necessary', which must not bear the character of a purely arbitration body.
The clauses in the rules governing the relations between the Central Committee and the local commit­ tees, and defining the sphere of jurisdiction of the Central Com­ mittee, cannot and should not enumerate all the points over which the Central Committee has jurisdiction.
An enumeration is impossible and inconvenient because it is impossible to fore­ see all cases, and, moreover, points not mentioned would appear to be beyond the jurisdiction of the Central Committee.
The Central Committee should be allowed to determine its sphere of jurisdiction, because every local matter may affect the interests of the whole Party, and the Central Committee must be able to intervene in local affairs, against local interests perhaps, but in the interests of the Party as a whole.
Speech delivered August 11 (July 29), 1903.
B.
Speech During the Discussion of the Party Rules*** Lenin: I should like first of all to make two remarks of a personal character.
First, on the subject of Axelrod’s kindly 358 proposal (I am not speaking ironically) to ‘'strike a bar­ gain.
”* I would willingly respond to this appeal, because I do not consider our differences to be so vital as to be a matter of life or death to the Party.
We certainly will not perish be­ cause of a bad clause in the rules! But since it has come to the point of choosing between two formula?, I simply cannot aban­ don my firm conviction that Martov’s formula is worse than the original draft and may in certain conditions cause considerable harm to the Parly.
** The second remark concerns Comrade Brooker.
Naturally, de­ siring as he does to apply the elective principle everywhere, Comrade Brooker accepted my formula as the only one which defines what is meant by a member of the Party at all exactly.
I fail, therefore, to understand Comrade Martov's satisfaction at Comrade Brooker’s agreement with me.
Is Comrade Martov really guided by the very opposite of what Brooker says, with­ out considering the motives and arguments? Coming now to the subject under discussion, I must say that Comrade Trotsky has completely misunderstood the fundamental idea advanced by Comrade Plekhanov,*** and, therefore, in his observations, lias evaded the very essence of the question.
He spoke of intel­ lectuals and workers, of the class point of view and of the mass movement, but he failed to observe one of the basic questions: does my formula restrict or broaden the term, member of the Party? Had he asked himself this question, he would easily have seen that my formula restricts this conception, while Mar­ tov’s broadens it, for (to use Martov’s own correct expression) it is distinguished for its “elasticity.
” And in the period of Party life that we are now passing through, this very “elastic­ ity” undoubtedly opens the door for all elements of confusion, vacillation and opportunism.
To refute this simple and obvious argument you have to prove that there are no such elements; but Comrade Trotsky did not dream of doing tihat.
Nor can it be proved, because everyone knows that there are not a few such elements, and that they exist even among the working class.
It is necessary to safeguard the firmness of our line and the purity of the Party’s principles now more than at any other time, because with its unity restored the Party will accept into its ranks very many unstable elements, the number of which will grow as the Party growrs.
Comrade Trotsky completely mis­ interpreted the main idea of my book What Is To Be Done? when he said that the Party is not a conspirative organisation (many others raised this objection).
He forgot that in my book I propose a number of types of organisations, from the most secret and most exclusive to comparatively broad and “free” (lose) organisations.
He forgot that the Party must be only the vanguard, the leader of the vast masses of the working class, the whole (or nearly the whole) of which works “under the control and guidance” of the Party organisations, but which does not and should not, as a whole, join the “Party.
” Now see what conclusions Comrade Trotsky arrives at in consequence of his main mistake.
He told us here that if line after line of workers were arrested, and all the workers declared that they did not belong to the Party, our Party would appear to be a strange one! Is it not the other way round? Is not Comrade Trotsky’s argument a strange one? He regards as sad what a revolutionary of any experience at all would only rejoice at.
If hundreds and thousands of workers wdio had been arrested for taking part in strikes and demonstrations were not found to be members of Party organisations, it w'ould only prove that we have good organisations, and that we are fulfilling our task of keeping a more or less limited circle of leaders secret and of drawing the broadest possible masses into action.
The root of the mistakes made by those who stand for Martov’s formula lies in that they not only ignore one of the main evils of our Party life, but even sanctify it.
That evil lies in the fact that in an atmosphere of almost universal political discontent, in con­ ditions which require complete secrecy in our work, in condi­ tions wrhich require the concentration of the greater part of our activities in narrow, underground circles and even meetings with individual persons, it is extremely difficult and almost impossible for us to distinguish talkers from workers.
And there is hardly another country in the world in which the confusion of these two categories is as common, causes such boundless confusion and does so much damage as in Russia.
We suffer severely from the presence of this evil, not only among the intelligentsia, but also in the ranks of the working class, and Comrade Martov’s formula legitimatises it.
This formula necessarily strives to make all and sundry members of the Party! Comrade Martov himself was forced to admit this with a reservation: “if you like, yes,” he said.
But this is precisely what we don’t like! This is precisely why we are so determined in our opposition to Martov’s formula.
It is better that ten who actually work should not call themselves members of the Party (real workers don’t hunt for titles!) than that one talker should have the right and opportunity to be a Party member.
This is a principle which seems to me to be indisputable, and which compels me to fight Martov.
I have been told that we give no rights to Party members, and that, therefore, there can be no abuses.
Such an argument is quite unsound.
In the first place, although we do not state what particular riglits a Party member acquires, I want you to note that we do not state that there is to be any restriction of Party members’ rights.
Secondly—and this is the main point—even apart from rights, we must not forget that every Party member is responsible for the Party, and that the Party is responsible for every one of its members.
In the condi­ tions in which wTe have -to carry on our political activities, in the present rudimentary state of political organisation, it would be simply dangerous and harmful to give those who are not members of the organisation the rights of members, and to make the Party responsible for people who do not belong to an organ­ isation (and perhaps deliberately refrain from joining).
Com­ rade Martov was horrified al the idea that a person on trial who is not a member of a Party organisation will have no right, in spite of his energetic activity, to call himself a member of our Party.
This does not frighten me.
On the contrary, serious dam­ age would be done if a person wrho called himself a Party member without belonging to any of the Party organisations behaved unsatisfactorily in court.
It will be impossible to deny that such a person was working under -the control and guidance of our organisation—impossible because of the very vagueness of the term.
Actually, there can he no doubt about this—the words “under the control and guidance” will mean that there will be neither control nor guidance.
The Central Committee will never be in a position to exercise real control over all those who work for, but do not belong to, our organisation.
Our task is to place effective control in the hands of the Central Commit­ tee.
Our task is to safeguard the consistency, the steadfastness, the purity of our Party.
We must strive to raise the calling and the significance of a Party member higher, higher and still higher—and that is why I am opposed to Martov’s formula.

C.
Speech on the Election of the Editorial Board of “Iskra” * I ask the Congress to permit me to reply to Martov.
1 Comrade Martov said that the vote just taken cast a slur on his political reputation.
The elections had nothing to do with casting slurs on political reputations.
(Cries oj: “not true, that's wrong!" Plekhanov and Lenin protest against the interruptions, Lenin asks the secretaries to enter iu the minutes that Comrades Zasulich, Martov and Trotsky interrupted him, and that the number oj interruptions be recorded.
) To adopt this view means denying the right of die Congress to make new elections, to make any alteration in the composition of its official bodies, to reshuffle the bodies it has set up.
The Organisation Committee serves to illustrate the confusion that is created by such an attitude.
The Congress expressed complete confidence in and gratitude to the Organisation Committee, but we ridiculed the very suggestion that the Congress has no right to examine the relations existing in the O.
C.
, we rejected every supposition that the O.
C.
, as formerly constituted, would hinder the “uncom-radely” reshuffling of the O.
C.
and the formation of a new Cen­ tral Committee consisting of any elements we please.
I repeat: 1 The original minutes give the beginning of the speech as follows: “Martov’s speech was so strange that I find myself obliged to protest emphatically against his statement of the case.
As I see it, in the first place, Martov’s protest against the election of the editorial board, his Martov’s views on the admissibility of electing part of the pre­ vious board are evidence of utter confusion of political concep­ tions.
I come now to the question of the “two groups of three.
” Comrade Martov said that this whole scheme of “two groups of three” was the work of one person, one member of the editorial board (namely, myself), and that no one else was responsible for it.
/ categorically protest against this assertion, and declare that it is quite untrue.
Let me remind Comrade Martov that some weeks before the Congress I plainly told him and one other member of the editorial board that I would demand the free election, of the editorial board at the Congress.
I gave up this plan only because Comrade Martov himself suggested to me a more convenient plan of electing Iwo groups of three.
I then drew up the plan on paper and sent it first of all to Com­ rade Martov, who returned it to me with some amendments; here it is.
I have the very copy, with Comrade Martov’s amend­ ments written in red ink.
Afterwards a number of comrades saw the draft dozens of times, all the members of the editorial board saw it, and no one at any time formally objected to it.
I say “formally,” because, if I am not mistaken, Comrade Axelrod on one occasion made some private remark to the effect that he did not sympathise with the scheme.
But it goes without saying that something more than a private remark was required to express the protest of the editorial board.
It was not without reason that, even before the Congress, the editorial board adopted a formal decision to invite a definite seventh person, so that, in case it was necessary to make a collective statement at the Congress, an unalterable decision could be adopted—which we refusal, and that of his colleagues, to work on the editorial board, which has yet to be elected, is in crying contradiction to what we all said (Mar­ tov included) when Iskra was declared tho Party organ.
We were told then that such recognition was pointless, since one cannot endorse a mere title without endersing the editorial board; and Comrade Martov himself then explained, to those who objected that this ttas not true, that a definite political trend was being endorsed, that the composition of die editorial board was in no way prejudiced, and that the selection of the editors would come up later, on point 18 of our agenda.
Therefore, Comrade Martov had absolutely no right to speak of the limited recogni­ tion of Iskra"—Ed.
so often failed to do on the board of six.
And all the members of the editorial board know that the addition of a seventh permanent member to the board of six had been the subject of our con-stant consideration for a very long time.
Thus, I repeat, the way out, in the form of the election of “two groups of three” was quite a natural one, and one which I incorporated in my draft with the knowledge and consent of Comrade Martov.
And later on, Comrade Martov, together with Comrade Trotsky and others, again and again at a number of private meetings of Iskra-ists advocated the system of electing “two groups of three.
” In cor­ recting Martov’s statement about the private character of the two groups of three, I have no intention of assailing Martov’s affirmation of the “political significance” of the step we took in refusing to endorse the old editorial board.
On the contrary, I entirely and unreservedly agree with Comrade Martov when he says that this step is of great political significance—only not the significance that Martov attributes to it.
He said it was an act in the struggle for influence over the Central Committee in Russia.
I shall go further than Martov and say that the whole of Iskra'* activity up to now has been a struggle for influence as a private group; but now, the issue is much bigger, tax.
, the organisational consolidation of influence, and not only the struggle for it The degree to which I differ from Comrade Martov politically can be seen from the fact that he blames me for desiring to influence the C.
C.
, whereas I consider it meritorious on my part to have striven and to strive to consolidate that influence by organisational means.
It turns out that we even speak different languages.
What was the use of all our work, of all our efforts, if they were to be crowned by ithe old struggle for influence, and not by the complete acquisition and con­ solidation of influence? Yes, Comrade Martov is quite right: the step we have taken is undoubtedly a big political step, which bears witness to the selection of one of the tendencies which have now made themselves apparent in the further work of our Party.
And I am not at all frightened by terrible words about “a state of siege in the Party,” about “exceptional laws against individual persons and groups,” and so forth.
In regard to un­ stable and wavering elements, it is not only our right but our duty to create “a state of siege,” and the whole of our Party rules, of our centralism now ratified by the Congress, is nothing but “a state of siege” against these numerous sources of political diffusiveness.
It is precisely against diffusiveness that we need special, even exceptional, laws, and the step taken by the Congress has indicated the right political direction, by creating a reliable basis for such laws and such measures.

REPORT ON THE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
TO THE SECOND CONGRESS OF THE LEAGUE OF RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARY SOCIAL­ DEMOCRATS ABROAD* Before beginning his report Lenin referred to the debates that had taken place at the preceding session on the question of the degree to which it is permissible to allude to the private meet­ ings held by the Iskra-ists during the Party Congress.
He in­ terpreted yesterday’s decision of the Congress as signifying drat the reporters must not say more than is absolutely necessary about facts that are not recorded in the minutes.
Consequently» when speaking of the meetings of the members of the Iskra or­ ganisation he intended to mention only the results of the voting.
After these introductory remarks he went on to speak of the period immediately preceding the Party Congress.
In the O.
C.
, whose business it was to prepare for the Congress, the Iskra-iste had a majority, and its work was carried on in an Iskra-isl direction.
But even in the course of these preparations it be­ came apparent that the O.
C.
was far from being completely united.
To begin with, it included one Bundist1 * who took every opportunity to hinder the calling of a Congress of the Iskra-itf.
tendency; this member of the O.
C.
always pursued his own line.
In addition, the O.
C.
included two members of the Yuzhny Rabochy group*9, and although they claimed to be As/zrn-ists and even announced their adherence to Iskra, on the subject of which negotiations were carried on for a very long time, they cannot be regarded as one hundred per cent /sfcra-ists.
Even the IskraAst.
members of the O.
C.
were not completely united, there were differences of opinion among them.
It is also important to 1 K.
Portnoy.

—Fd.
recall the decision of the O.
C.
on the question of imperative mandates.
The question came up long before the Congress met and the decision was that imperative mandates must be abolished.
The editorial board very definitely declared itself to be of the same mind.
The decision applied to the editorial board itself.
It was decided that as the Congress is the supreme authority in the Parly, no member of the Party, or of the editorial board, should consider himself bound by any commitments to the or­ ganisation that elected him.
In view of this decision I drew up a draft of the Tagesordnung of the Congress together with a commentary, which I intended to submit to the Congress in my own name.
Point 23 of the draft had a marginal note about electing three persons to the editorial board and as many to the C.
C.
This point is connected with one further circumstance.
As the editorial board consisted of six persons, it was decided by common consent that, in the event of it being necessary to con­ vene a conference of the editorial board during the Congress, and in the event of the votes being divided equally, Comrade Pavlovich be invited to the conference with a decisive vote.
The delegates began assembling long before the opening of the Congress.
The O.
C.
gave them the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the editors.
Quite naturally, the Iskra-ists wished to present themselves to the Congress united and agreed on all points, and with this object in view private conversations were held with the arriving delegates, and meetings were organised with the object of establishing unity of views.
At these meetings the political complexion of some of the delegates became de­ finitely revealed.
For instance, at one of the meetings, after I had read a paper on the national question, a delegate of the mining district spoke in the spirit of the P.
P.
S.
and displayed extreme confusion of mind.
Such are the circumstances that preceded the Congress.
I must now explain why I turned out to be the only delegate of the League, although the latter had elected two.
It appeared that no delegate had arrived from the Iskra organisation in Russia, which was to have sent two delegates.
At a meeting of the /s&ra-ists held just before the opening of the Congress, it waa decided that one of the two delegates sent by the League should surrender his mandate to the other delegate, and himself act as the delegate of the Iskra organisation with two mandates, with the provision that he was to give one of the two mandate«* of the Iskra organisation to the elected delegate from Russia if he arrived.
Naturally, both Martov and I wanted to be the dele­ gate of Iskra in view of the insignificant role played by the League.
The quesition was decided by drawing lots.
The first preliminary question—the election of the Bureau of the Congress—gave rise to a certain, though insignificant, differ­ ence between Martov and me.
The former insisted on nine persons being elected, and these to include even a Bundist, I considered that it was necessary to elect a bureau that would be able to pursue a firm, consistent policy and, if required, would even be capable of using the so-called “spiked gloves.
” J Plekhanov, Lenin and Pavlovich were elected.
In addition to the five Bundists there were present at the Congress two delegates of the League of Russian Social-Dem­ ocrats Abroad and the delegates of the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle, who nearly always voted with the latter.
From the very outset these persons did what they could to prolong the debate.
The debate on the standing orders of the Congress alone took up a tremendous amount of time.
There were endless dis­ putes, which took up several sessions, about the place of the Bund in the Party.
The Bundist elected to the credentials com­ mission was responsible for delays of the same kind.
He tried to cause obstruction on every point.
There was not a single question on which the agreed with the other members of the commission, one of whom was myself, and he always “reserved his opinion.
” When it was remarked that this might protract the Congress, the Bundist replied, “let it be protracted,” and ex­ pressed his readiness to sit on the commission for any length of lime.
It was only long after midnight that we finished our work of verifying the delegates’ credentials.
On one of the first days of the Congress the O.
C.
incident occurred.
According to the rule they had drawn up, only “pro 1 A Russian expression meaning to keep a tight rein.
—Ed.
Enp.
cd.
minent Party members” could be invited to the Congress with a consultative vote; the credentials commiseion had rejected the request of the Borba group that it be given credentials.
Two members of the O.
C.
were on that commission, and voted against admitting a representative of Bor ba to the Congress.
When the reporter of the commission conveyed this decision to the Con­ gress a long debate arose “for” and “against” admitting them, and one of the Iskra-isls expressed the opinion that no repre­ sentative of Borba ought to be admitted to the Congress because that group did nothing but intrigue and try to insinuate itself into every chink, that it sowed dissension everywhere, and so on.
(Trotsky: llhy don’t you give the name of the speaker? It was I who said it.
Axelrod: Evidently the reporter does not think it would be in his interest.
) Yes, it was Comrade Trotsky who spoke so harshly of the Borba group.
At fllie very height of the dispute about whether a representative of Borba should be ad.
milted to the Congress or not, one of the Yuzhny Rabochy dele­ gates, who had been late for the opening and had just arrived,1 asked for a five minute adjournment to allow him to become acquainted with all the circumstances relating to the question under discussion.
When the adjournment was granted the mem­ bers of the O.
C.
held a conference, right near the window.
It must be pointed out that even before the opening of the Con­ gress some of the members of the O.
C.
had expressed their dis­ satisfaction with the editorial board.
Thus the Bundist member of the O.
C.
was extremely indignant at the fact that the editorial board had sent its contribution of five hundred marks to the election fund of the German Social-Democrats in its own name and that of the O.
C.
without obtaining sanction from the latter.
This innocent action, which was quite natural considering the impossibility of communicating in time with the comrades in Russia, was interpreted by the Bundist as meaning that the editors abroad used the name of the O.
C.
without asking the permission of the latter.
A resolution was even moved in the O.
C.
to reprove the editors for this action, and this was passed 1E.
Y.
Levin.
—Ed.
24 Lenin 11 because Comrade N.
N.
,1 though he was a member of the Iskra* ist organisation, supported the Bundist.
When I informed Martov of this, he was very indignant and said it was “despicable.
” (Martov: 1 did not use the word “despicable”) I do not re­ member the actual expression he used.
Martov added that he “will not leave the matter there.
” I tried to persuade him that the business was not so very important, and that it would be better to let it go and attach no serious importance to the inci­ dent.
When the conference of the O.
C.
by the window ended, Comrade Pavlovich, who was one of its members, informed the other two members of the Bureau that, on the motion of the belated Yuzhny Rabochy delegate, who was also a member of the O.
C.
, die O.
C.
, by a majority of all against Pavlovich him­ self, had decided to invite a representative of Borba, Ryazanov, to the Congress with a consultative vote.
Comrade Pavlovich strongly opposed this decision, and as imperative mandates had been abolished, he considered himself entitled to protest against the decision at the Congress.
We, the members of the Bureau, as well as the editors and the other Iskrarisls, were very indig­ nant at this decision of the O.
C.
The member of the O.
C.
I have already mentioned, Comrade N.
N.
himself, at a meeting of tire credentials commission, had voted against admitting a represent­ ative of Borba to the Congress, and now at this conference of the O.
C.
he agreed to invite one.
He himself was now trying to smuggle Ryazanov into the Congress.
We had been caught in a trap.
We decided to fight vigorously against this scandalous decision of the O.
C.
Many delegates spoke against it.
In my speech on the subject I said: “what a storm of indignation is always raised at European congresses against those who say one thing in committee and another thing on the floor of the Con­ gress.
” In saying this I had in mind Comrade N.
N.
, a member of the Iskra organisation.
When Comrade Pavlovich told the Congress that he had protested against this decision of the O.
C.
, the Yuzhny Rabochy delegate said that this was a breach of discipline, a disruptive move, and so on, and demanded that the Congress inflict exemplary punishment on Comrade Pavlovich 1 E.
M.
Alexandrova.
—Ed.
for his action.
But we succeeded in smashing all these argu­ ments.
The O.
C.
majority was defeated.
A resolution was passed to the effect that after the Congress had appointed a credentials commission the O.
C.
as a body was no longer entitled to in­ fluence the way the Congress should be constituted.
The motion to invite Ryazanov was rejected.
But even after die Congress some of the iskra-iste expressed doubt and asked: why not admit a member of Borba to the Congress? (Deutsch: 1 said that at the Congress as well.
) Quite right, and on other questions, loo, as I shall have occasion to point out, Comrade Deutsch did not always vote together with the other /sAro-ists, as for instance, on the question of the equal status of languages.
There are /sAra-ists today who express exceedingly odd opinions, such as, for instance, that the activity of the C.
C.
must reflect all the vacillations and all the primitive conceptions that exist in the Party.
Certain unstable, vacillating Iskra-ists spoke in the same way at die Congress.
Thus, it turns out that die idea that all diose who are regarded as Iskra-ists are really Iskra-ists is en­ tirely mistaken.
There are IskraAsts who are ashamed to call themselves /sAra-ists, that is a fact.
There are Iskra-iste who fight Iskra, who place obstacles in its way, who hold up its work.
Iskra has become popular, it has become the fashion to call oneself an Iskra-ist, but this does not prevent people from remaining what they were before Iskra was recognised by a number of Party committees.
Such unreliable /sAra-ists have done a great deal of harm.
If they fought Iskra openly and squarely.
.
.
.
But no, diey do it in an underhand way, from behind the corner, unobserved, secretly.
The second item on the Tagesordnung was the Party pro­ gramme.
The supporters of Rabocheye Dyelo, the Bundists and a number of individual delegates who were nicknamed the “Marsh” pursued a policy of incredible obstruction.
The debate on the programme was drawn out beyond all belief.
Akimov alone moved several score of amendments.
There were argu­ ments literally about single words, about what conjunction to use.
So many amendments had to be discussed that one Bundist, a member of the programme commission, very ap­ 24* propriately asked whose draft we were considering, the one sub­ mitted by the editors of Iskra or one submitted by Akimov? The amendments moved were insignificant and the programme was adopted without serious amendment; nevertheless, tlie de­ bates took up about twenty sessions, so unproductive was the work of the Congress made by the opposition carried on by all sorts of anti-/sA:ra-ist and quasi-/skra-ist elements.
The next major incident at the Congress, after the O.
C.
inci.
dent, was that in connection with the equal status of languages, or, as it was ironically called at die Congress, “the freedom of tongues.
” (Martov: Or “of asses.
99 Laughter.
) Yes, and “of asses.
” The point was this: the draft Party programme spoke of equal rights for all citizens regardless of sex, nationality, religion, etc.
The Bundists were not satisfied with this and demanded that the programme include the right of every nation­ ality to be taught in its own language, and also to use it in addressing all public and state institutions.
In reply to a remark by a garrulous Bundist who quoted the State Remount Depart­ ment as an example, Comrade Plekhanov remarked that the Remount Department had nothing to do with the question be­ cause horses do not possess the gift of speech and “it is only asses that do.
” The Bundists took offence, evidently taking the jest to be directed at them.
Il was on the question of equal status of languages that the split first became apparent.
In addition to the Bundists, the Kubocheye Dyelo-vsXs and the “Marsh,” several Iskra-ists spoke in favour of the “freedom of tongues.
” The way Comrade Deutsch voted on this issue provoked our astonishment, indigna­ tion, etc.
; he would either abstain or vote against us.
In the end tlie question was decided amicably and unanimously.
Speaking generally, during the first half of the Congress the Iskra-ists acted in unison.
The Bundists said there was a con­ spiracy against them.
One Bundist described the Congress as “a compact majority.
” In reply I expressed the wish that the whole of our Party might become one compact majority.
The second half of the Congress presented a very different picture.
From that moment begins Martov’s historic volte-face.
The dissensions that now arose in our midst were by no means insignificant.
They were caused by Martov’s mistaken estimation of the present situation.
Comrade Martov deviated from the line he had previously adhered to.
The fifth item on the Tagesordnung was the rules.
A dispute had arisen in the commission between Martov and me concerning point 1 of that document.
We each insisted on different form­ ula?.
I proposed that a Party member be regarded as one who adheres to the Party programme, gives material support to the Party and belongs to one of the organisations of the Party.
Martov, however, thought it sufficient if, in addition to the first two conditions, a member worked under the control of one of the Party organisations.
I insisted on my formula and pointed out that we could not adopt any other definition of a member of the Party without abandoning the principle of centralism.
To regard a person who does not belong to any Party organisa­ tion as a member of die Party meant opposition to all control by the Party.
Martov was introducing a new principle entirely opposed to the principles of Iskra.
Martov’s formula stretched the boundaries of the Party.
He argued that our Party must become a parly of the masses.
He left the door wide open for every kind of opportunist and stretched the boundaries of the Party until they became quite blurred.
In the conditions in which we have to work this is very dangerous, because it would make it very difficult to draw a line between a revolutionary and an idle talker; this makes it necessary for us to restrict the concept of the Party.
Martov’s mistake was that he left the door of the Party wide open for every scamp, while it had be­ come apparent that even at the Congress fully a third were mere intriguers.
Martov on this occasion acted as an opportunist.
The formula he proposed introduced a false note into the rules: every Party member must be under the control of an organ­ isation in such a way that the C.
C.
may be able to reach him.
The formula I proposed gave a stimulus to organisation.
Com­ rade Martov cheapened the concept of the Party, while I thought that it must be placed on a high, very high plane.
Rabocheye Dyeloi the Bund and the “Marsh” supported Martov, and with their aid he was able to get his formulation of point 1 adopted.
Then Martov began to talk about “discrediting rumours” that were being circulated about him.
There was no offence in point­ ing out whose ally Martov had turned out to be.
I myself was the object of similar attacks when I found myself at one with Comrade Brooker.
And I look no offence when Martov sent me a note with the words: “Look who is voting with you.
” It is true, my alliance with Brooker was temporary and accidental; where­ as Martovas alliance with the Bund turned out to be a per­ manent one.
I was opposed to Martov’s formula because it was a Versumpfung.
1 I warned Martov of this, and our opponents, by following Martov as one man, served as an eloquent illustra­ tion of his error.
The most dangerous thing, however, was not that Martov had slipped into the marsh, but that having accident­ ally slipped into it he made no attempt to get out of it, but was sucked in more and more.
The Bundists felt that they were masters of the situation, and they left their impress on the Party rules.
During the second half of the Congress there was again a compact majority, but it now consisted of a coalition of Mar­ tovists, plus the “Marsh,” plus the compact minority of Ra-bocheye Dyelo and the Bund.
And this compact majority was opposed to the /sfera-ists.
One Bundist, seeing the Iskra-ists quar­ relling among themselves, said: “It is pleasant to argue when the leaders are fighting each other.
” Under these circumstances I fail to understand why the Bund should have left the Con­ gress.
They were masters of the situation and could have secured a great deal for themselves.
Most probably, they had an im­ perative mandate.
After point 1 of the rules had been damaged in this way, we had to bind the broken vessel as tightly as possible with a double knot.
Naturally, we began to apprehend plots and in­ trigues.
Hence, it was necessary to introduce reciprocal co­ optation in the central bodies so as to secure their unity of action for the Party.
A fight arose on this issue.
Matters had to be arranged in such a way as to prevent a repetition at the 1 Becoming transformed into a marsh.
-*Ed, Eng, cd.
Third Party Congress of what had occurred to the O.
C.
A con­ sistent, honest Iskra cabinet had to be formed.
On this point we were again defeated.
The point about reciprocal co-optation to the central bodies was voted down.
Martov’s error, supported by the “Marsh,” became still more vividly apparent.
From that moment the coalition was definitely formed and, under the menace of defeat, we had to load our guns with double charges.
The votes of the Bund and Rabochcye Dyelo were deciding the fate of the Congress.
All this led to a fierce and stubborn struggle.
I shall now pass to the private meetings of the Iskra organisa­ tion.
At these meetings we were chiefly occupied with the ques­ tion of the constitution of the C.
C.
At all the four meetings of the Iskra organisation, there wrere debates on the question of Comrade N.
N.
, on whom a section of the Iskra-ists wanted to pass a vote of political no-confidence, although not in the literal sense, for no one accused N.
N.
of anything dishonour­ able, but in the sense that N.
N.
was unfit to be a member of the IskraAst cabinet.
This led to furious fights.
At the last meeting sixteen voted against N.
N.
, four voted in favour, the rest abstaining.
At this meeting, also, the question was decided as to who was to be included in our cabinet Martov and I proposed different “groups of three,” and we could come to no agreement.
As we did not want to split our vote at the Congress we decided to propose a compromise list.
We were prepared to make every concession: I agreed to a list containing two Martov­ ists.
The minority rejected this.
Incidentally, the Yuzhny Ra* bochy delegate refused to be included in our list, although he agreed to be included in the Martovist list.
Yuzhny Rabochy— an outside element—decided the question of the C.
C.
After the split among the /sira-ists, we had to recruit supporters, and we started vigorous agitation.
The unexpected withdrawal of the Bund changed the whole situation at once.
Once again there was a compact majority and a compact minority.
We were the major­ ity and we secured the election of the people we wanted to the C.
C.
Such are the circumstances that led to the split.
It was ex­ ceedingly tactless of Martov to raise the question of endorsing all the six editors of Iskra at the Congress, when he knew that I would insist on the editors being elected.
It meant turning the question of electing the editors into a vote of no-confidence on certain individuals on the editorial board.
By five o’clock on Saturday the elections were over.
We then proceeded to discuss the resolutions.
We had only a few hours left for this.
Owing to the obstacles and delays caused by the ‘’Marsh,” we had to drop a number of important items from the Tagesordnimg:, for instance, we had no time left to discuss all the tactical questions.
The attitude of the Congress to the resolutions was so unanim­ ous that we received the impression that a conciliatory mood ait lasit prevailed; it seemed to us that Martov was not going to make a political issue of the dissensions that had arisen.
When one of the Yuzhny Rabochy-ists questioned the validity of the elections, he even remarked that the minority would sub­ mit to all the decisions of the Congress.
All the resolutions were passed peacefully and amicably; there were dissensions only on the resolution proposed by Starover concerning the liberals.
It was too diffuse, and it too bore the traces of op­ portunism; we fought it and secured the adoption of another resolution on the same question.
* The general impression one got from the Congress was that we had to fight against intrigues.
It was impossible for us to work.
The natural conclusion was: “Heaven preserve us from friends like these,” i.
e.
, from quasi-fsfcra-ists.
Martov utterly failed to understand this.
He elevated his mistaken position to a principle.
His assertion that the majority had established a “state of siege” was in crying contradiction to the real needs of the Party.
In order that the work might be more effective it was necessary to eliminate the deterrent elements and make them innocuous for the Party; only if we succeed in doing this will our work at the next Congress be more fruitful.
That is why it was necessary to establish complete unity among the central bodies of the Party.

1 1 ' The first half of the Congress is diametrically opposed to the second.
The cardinal points of the whole Congress may be re­ duced to the following four major moments: 1) the O.
C.
inci­ dent; 2) the debates on the equal status of languages; 3) the debates on point 1 of the rules, and 4) the struggle about the elections to the Party centres.
During the first half of the Congress, we, together with Mar­ tov, were opposed to the O.
C.
, the Bund, Rabochcye Dyelo and the “Marsh”; during the second half Martov accidentally fell into'the marsh.
Now, after the Congress, an accidental Versump-fung has become a real Versumpfung.
Report delivered October 27 (14), 1903.
A NOTE ON THE POSITION OF THE NEW ISKRA * What incenses me most of all in the position taken up by the “Martovist” Iskra is its internal falsity and falsehood, its at­ tempts to evade the essence of the matter, its attempts to deceive Party public opinion and to evade Party decisions, and its at­ tempts to shuffle ideas and facts.
And I am inclined to think that the only way the obtuseness and indifference manifested by some comrades, their insensitiveness to this falsehood, can be accounted for is by their ignorance of the circumstances.
Ignor­ ance must be combated by explanation, and on no account shall I abandon my intention of explaining the whole matter in the greatest detail (if necessary, with all the documents) in a special pamphlet which I shall write as soon as the minutes of the Con­ gresses of the Party and of the League are out, in other words, very soon.
The chief piece of legerdemain by means of which the Mar­ tovists are trying to cheat the Party (as they are in a state of hysterics it is possible, even probable, that they are deceiving themselw« first and foremost) is, in the first place, their con­ juring with the real sources and causes of the dissension among the Iskra-ists.
In the second place, it is their conjuring with the concepts of circle spirit and disorganisation, of sectarianism and Party.
The first conjuring trick was to advance as a difference on “principle” what was really no more than recrimination between the two sides, after the Congress, during the struggle between the centres and the opposition.
This recrimination consisted of the.
opposition calling the majority autocrats, formalists, bureau­ crats, etc.
, while the majority called the opposition hysterical sneaks .
.
.
a party of rejected Ministers or hysterical row'dics (see the Congress of the League**).
378 And now one side of these mutual “compliments” is being brought out in the C.
O.
as dissension on principle! Is this not despicable? In reality the cause of the dissension was the volte-face of the Martovists towards the marsh.
The volte-face became clearly apparent at the Congress in the debates on point 1 of the rules and during the voting at the election of the centres.
This dis­ sension, which in part was certainly a dissension on principle, is evaded or hushed up.
The second conjuring trick is that while, for three months, they have been disorganising the whole Party and all the work in; the interests of a circle, in order to insinuate themselves into the centres (for no one ever wished to set limits to polemics on the essence of the question, or to the freedom to express opinion; on the contrary, the Martovists were invited and begged to write), the Martovists, now that they have got into the editorial board by the back door, by sleight-of-hand, substitute for this the ridiculous accusation that the majority is disruptively for­ malistic, bureaucratic, etc.
, and they remain silent about their own boycott, their own intrigues, etc.
Is this not despicable? Either—or; either consign the whole “squabble” to oblivion, and in that case stop talking about it altogether, do not allow even an echo of the squabble to appear in the C.
O.
, because all this shouting about bureaucracy is precisely an echo of the nastiest sort of sneaking; or raise the question of disagreements, and in that case, make everything public.
December 1903.
WHY I RESIGNED FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF ISKRA 1 A LETTER TO THE EDITORS OF ISKRA This is not by any means a personal question.
It is a question of the relation of the majority to the minority of our Party Congress.
I am therefore duty bound to answer it at once and openly, not only because the delegates of the majority are bom­ barding me with questions, but because the article “Our Con­ gress,” which appears in No.
53 of Iskra, throws an entirely false light on the not very profound but disruptive disagreement among the Iskra-iste to winch the Congress led.
* The article gives an account of the matter that makes it im­ possible for anyone, even with the help of a magnifying glass, to discover a single serious cause for disagreement, to find so much as a shadow of explanation of a fact such as the change in the constitution of the editorial board of the C.
O.
, or to find even the pretence of a valid reason for my resigning from the board.
We disagreed on the question of the organisation of the Party centres, says the writer of the article, on the question of the relation of the C.
O.
to the C.
C.
, on the method of achieving centralism, on the limits and the nature of possible and useful centralisation, and the harm of bureaucratic formalism.
Really? Did we not disagree on the question of the constitution of the centres, whether it was permissible to boycott the centres because one did not like the people that had been elected by the Congress, to disrupt practical work, to alter the decisions of the Party Congress to please a certain circle of Social-Dem­ ocrats abroad, like the majority of the League? 2 11 sent this letter to Iskra immediately after No.
53 appeared.
The editors refused to publish it in No.

380 You know perfedtly well, comrades, that this was precisely the case.
But the great majority of the most influential and most active Party workers do not know this yet, and so I shall briefly outline the main facts, because before long, according to an announcement in Iskra, No.
53, all the material relating to the history of our disagreements will be published.
At our Congress—as the writer of the article we are discuss­ ing and the Bund delegation in their recently published report rightly point out—the /sAra-ists had a considerable majority, about three-fifths according to my calculation, even before the withdrawal of the delegates of the Bund and of Rabocheye DyelcK During the first half of the Congress the Iskra-ists were unanimous in their opposition to all the anti-YsAra-ists and in­ consistent Iskra-isis, This was brought out particularly plainly in connection with two incidents in the first half of the Congress, incidents that are important for the understanding of our dis­ agreements: the O.
C.
incident and the incident in connection with the equal status of languages1 (the latter issue was the only one on which the compact majority of Iskra-ists dropped from three-fifths to one-half).
During the latter half of the Congress the /$A:ra-ists began to diverge and by the end of the Congress they had completely diverged.
The controversies around point 1 of the Party rules and around the elections to the cen­ tres clearly show the nature of the disagreements: the Iskra-ist minority (with Martov at their head) became the rallying point for an increasing number of non-/skra-iste and of vacillating elements, and opposed the majority of Iskra-ists (which included Plekhanov and me).
This group did not take definite shape on the issue of point 1 of the rules, nevertheless, the votes of the Bundists and two of the three Rabocheye Dyelo votes assured the Iskra-ist minority of a majority.
At the election of the cen­ tres the Iskra-ist majority (thanks to the withdrawal of five Bundists and two Rabocheye Dyelo votes from the Congress) became the majority of the Party Congress.
And it is only at this point that we disagreed in the strict sense of the word.

After the O.

incident, at the very beginning of the Congress, the Iskra-ists, at unofficial meetings of the Iskra or­ ganisation, began hotly to discuss various members (and non-members) of the O.
C.
as candidates for the C.
C.
After pro­ longed and heated debates they rejected one of the candidatures supported by Martov1 by a majority of nine to four, three abstaining; the list of five was adopted by a majority of ten to two, four abstaining; on my proposal, the list included one leader of the non-ZsAra-ist elements and one leader of the Iskra-ist minority.

The great battle waged at the Congress on the question of whether the old group of six should be endorsed or a new group of three be elected for the editorial board of the C.
O.
ended in the same way.
8 Only from this moment did the divergence become so com­ plete that it gave rise to the idea of a split; only from this moment did the minority (which now became a real “compact” minority) begin to abstain from voting in a hitherto unpre­ cedented way.
* After the Congress the divergence became in­ creasingly accentuated.
The discontented minority adopted a policy of boycott which has lasted for months.
Quite obviously, die charges of bureaucratic formalism, of demanding absolute, 1 The candidate was E.

Trotsky.
—Ed, 3 As this notorious “group of three” has given rise to endless talk and twaddle, I shall point out at once that long before the Congress all the comrades who were at all closely connected had been acquainted with my commentary on the draft Tagesordnung of the Congress.
The commentary, which was circulated at the Congress, contains the following: “The Con­ gress elects three persons to the editorial board of the C.
O.
and three to the C.
C.
These six persons sitting os one body may, if necessary, by a two-thirds majority complete the C.
O.
and the C.
C.
by co optation, and re­ port to the Congress on the matter.
After this report has been approved by the Congress, additional members will be co-opted by the editorial board of the C.
O.
and by the GC.
separately.
” automatic obedience, and similar nonsense, which grew out of this soil, are merely an attempt to shift responsibility, and this is sufficiently illustrated by the following typical case.
The new editorial board (i.
e.
, Plekhanov and I) invited all the former editors to become contributors; the invitation, of course, was at first made without iany “formalism,” by word of mouth.
It met with a refusal.
We then wrote a “letter” (what bureaucrats!) to the “dear comrades” asking them to contribute in general, and in particular to set forth their disagreements in the columns of the publications of which we were the editors.
We received a formal statement to the effect that they did not wish to have anything to do with Iskra.
And for several months not one of the non-editors worked for Iskra.
Relations became exclusively formal and bureaucratic—on whose initiative? An underground literature began to be produced which be­ came widespread abroad, was distributed to the committees, and is now beginning in part to return from Russia.
The report of the delegate for Siberia, —n’s1 letter on the slogans of the “opposition,” Martov’s “Once Again a Minority” are full of the most amusing charges against Lenin, accusing him of “auto­ cracy,” of establishing a Robespierre regime of executions * (sic/), of staging the political burial of old comrades (non­ election to the centres is the burial!), etc.
In the course of events the opposition is drawn into a quest for differences on “principle” on questions of organisation which preclude all team-work.
The notorious “fifth member” of the Council of the Party is bandied about particularly.
In all these literary pro­ ductions the formation of the Council is represented as Lenin’s diplomacy or trickery, an instrument by means of which the C.
O.
abroad might suppress the C.
C.
in Russia—which is ex­ actly the way the matter is presented by the Bund delegation in their report on the Congress.
Needless to say, these differ­ ences on principle arc as nonsensical as the notorious bureau­ cratic formalism: the fifth member has to be elected by the Congress, so that it is a matter of tlie person who most deserves the confidence of the majority; and whatever form of organisa-1F.

tion the Party centres may take, the will of the majority of the Party Congress will always manifest itself in the choice of definite persons.
How widely this literature was circulated abroad may be judged by the fact that even good Parvus took the warpath against the attempt to unite all the threads in one hand and to “give orders” (sic!) to the workers from some place like Gene­ va.

) In a month or so our new enemy of autocracy will read the min­ utes of the Parly Congress and of the League Congress, and will realise how easy it is to make a fool of oneself when one accepts all sorts of Parleiklatsch 1 2 at face value.
The climax of the opposition’s military operations against the centres was marked by the Congress of the League.
From the minutes of this Congress the reader will be able to judge whether those who called it an arena for settling accounts over the Party Congress were right, and whether there was anything in the on­ slaught of the opposition that provoked the C.
C.
to measures of a rather exceptional nature* (as the C.
C.
itself put it when the change in the editorial board offered some hope of restor­ ing peace in the Party).
The resolutions of this Congress reveal the nature of the differences “on principle” on the question of autocratic bureaucracy.
After the Congress of the League the split atmosphere became so menacing that Plekhanov decided to co-opt all the former editors.
I foresaw that the opposition would not be satisfied with this and I did not think it permissible to change a decision of the Party Congress to please a circle.
But I thought it still less permissible to stand in the way of a possible restoration of peace in the Party; so, after No.
51 of Iskra, I resigned from the editorial board, stating at the same time that I was not re­ fusing to continue as a contributor, and that I did not even in­ sist on having my resignation announced publicly if by that a good peace would be established in the Party.
** The opposition 1 A German Social-Democratic journal, where the article by Parvus ap­ peared.

—Ed, demanded (not a change in the non-existent system of bureau­ cracy, formalism, autocracy, automatism, etc.
, but) the rein­ statement of the former editorial hoard, the co-optation of rep­ resentatives of the opposition to the C.
C.
, two seats in the Council and the reoo«gnition of the validity of the Congress of the League.
The C.
C.
offered to secure peace by agreeing to co­ opt two members to the C.
C.
, by granting one seat in the Coun­ cil and by agreeing that the League be gradually reorganised.
These terms were also rejected by the opposition.
The editors were co-opted, but peace remained an open question.
Such was the state of affairs when No.
53 of Iskra appeared.
It is hardly permissible to doubt that the Parly desires peace and positive work.
But articles like “Our Congress” are an obstacle to peace; they are an obstacle because they bring in hints and fragments of questions that remain obscure and can­ not he understood unless all the stages of the divergence are set forth, they are an obstacle because they try to shift the blame from the circle abroad to our working centre, wrhich is engaged in the difficult and arduous task of uniting the Party, and which has been meeting quite enough obstacles in the way of introducing centralism without that.
The committees in Rus­ sia must fight against the disruptive activity and boycott tactics of the minority which is hindering all the work.
Resolutions to this effect have been received from the committees in St.
Peters­ burg, Moscow, Nizhni, Tver.
Odessa, Tula and the Northern League.
We have had enough of this foreign Literalengezankl 1 Let it serve the practical workers in Russia as an example of “whul should not be done” I Let the editors of the Party’s C.

Every circle, even that of Rabocheye Dyelo, on joining the Party, is entitled to demand the right to be heard and to defend its views; but no circle, not even a circle of generals, is entitled to demand representa­ tion in the Party centres.
In the second place, the difference lies in that the majority believes that the charge of formalism and bureaucracy falls on those who.
by refusing to work under the guidance of the centres, made it difficult to carry on the work in any other than a formal way.
In the third place, I am aware of one and of only one difference on principle on questions of organisation, namely, the difference which found expression in the debate on point 1 of the Party rules.
We hope to return to this question when the minutes of the Congress are published.
We shall then be able to show that it was not an accident that the formula proposed by Martov was carried with the help of non-1skra-ist and quasi-/sira-ist elements, but that it was a step in the direction of opportunism, and the step is still more apparent in —n’s letter and in “Once Again a Minority.
” 1 The minutes will demonstrate the falsity of the view held by the writer of the airticle, “Our Congress,” which asserts that “the controversy during the discussion of the Party rules was concen­ trated almost exclusively on the question of the organisation of the central bodies of the Party.
” The very opposite is the case.
The only real controversy on principle that divided the two “sides” (i.
e.
, the majority and the minority of the Iskra-ists) at all distinctly was that on point 1 of the Party rules.
As for the controversies on the constitution of the Council, on co-optation to the centres, etc.
, these were nothing more than controversies between individual delegates, between Martov and me, etc.
; they were controversies about relatively very minor details and did not give rise to any definite groupings of Iskra-ists, who by their votes corrected first one and then another of us when we went too far.
To assert that these controversies are 1 We shall then also ask to have explained what the article “Our Con­ gress*’ means by talking about an undeserved lack of attention to the non-/.
s£ra-ists, and about the strict points of the rules not corresponding to the real relation of forces in the Party.
What do these assertions refer to? the source of our dissensions on such questions as how to en­ force centralism, on its limits and character, etc.
, amounts simply to whitewashing the position taken by the minority and the methods they employed in their struggle to change the person­ nel of the centres, a struggle which was the only thing that pro­ voked divergence in the full sense of the word.

LETTER TO G.
M.
KRZHIZHANOVSKY, MEMBER OF THE C.
C.
* Geneva, December 18, 1903.
Dear Friend, We must thoroughly thrash out the question on which we appear to differ, and I earnestly ask you to have this letter discussed by all the members of the C.
C.
(or of the Executive Committee**).
The disagreement is this: 1) You believe peace with the Martovists to be possible (Boris1 even congratulates us on having concluded peace! *** Absurd and sad!).
2) You believe that an immediate congress would testify to our impo-fence.
I am convinced that on both points you are very much in the wrong.
1) The Martovists are on the warpath.
At a meet­ ing in Geneva Martov talked very loudly about their being a force.
In the paper2 they abuse us, shuffle the question despic­ ably and cover up their sneaking methods by an outcry against your bureaucracy.
Martov goes on shouting right and left about the complete worthlessness of the C.
C.
In a word, it is naive and absolutely impermissible to doubt that the aim of the Mar-tovists is to capture the C.
C.
by means of the same sneaking methods, boycott and scandals.
We are not in a position to fight them on this ground because the C.
O, is a terrible weapon and our defeat is certain, especially in view of the arrests.
By losing lime you court the certain and complete defeat of the entire majority, you swallow the insults hurled at the C.
C.
**** from abroad (by the League) in silence and ask for more.
2) A con­ gress wall prove our strength, it will prove that, not only in words but in deeds, we do not allow a clique of rowdies abroad to order the whole movement about.
We need the congress pre-1 V.

” This slogan is the only th;ng that can justify a congress and justify it fully in the eyes of all Russia.
If you miss this oppor­ tunity you will miss this slogan and prove your impotent pas­ sive submission to the Martovists.
To dream of strengthening your position by positive work in spite of the baiting carried on by the C.
O.
, of the boycott and of the Martovist agitation, is simply comical.
It means slow self-destruction in an inglorious struggle with intriguers, who will afterwards say (and are al­ ready saying): look how unworkable this C.
C.
is! I repeat, do not beguile yourselves with illusions.
Either you dictate peace to the Martovists at the congress, or else you will be inglorious-ly kicked out, or someone will be put in your place after the very first arrests.
Today a congress has an aim, viz,, to put an end to the impossible disorganisation, to get rid of the League * which laughs at all C.
C.
’s, to get firm hold of the Council and to organise the C.
O.
properly.
How can it be properly or­ ganised? At the very worst by leaving the Five (or restoring the Six),1 but this worst is unlikely if we have a big majority.
We shall then either get the better of the Martovists for good (Plekhanov is already talking of a new Vademecum? for he realises that there is no peace and threatens to attack both sides.
Nothing would suit us better!), or we shall frankly say that we have no C.
O.
to lead us and we shall turn it into a debating organ which will freely print signed articles by the majority and the minority (still better: to confine all polemics against the Martovists to pamphlets and to use Iskra only for the purpose of fighting the government and the enemies of Social-Democracy).
Hence, give up the naive hope of working peacefully in this impossible atmosphere.
Concentrate all your main forces on 1 2 1 The Five were the editorial board of Iskra after Plekhanov had co-opted the Martovists.

LETTER TO THE RUSSIAN BUREAU OF THE C.
C.
* Geneva, December 30, 1903.
We have received your letter of December 10 (old style).
We are amazed and shocked at your silence on the vital ques­ tions and your irregularity in answering letters.
This is not the way to do business! If Medved1 and Mrs.
Lan 2 are unable to write every week you must get another secretary.
Just imagine, Lan has not yet sent us anything detailed! Our letter of Decem­ ber 10 (new style) still remains unanswered (after 20 days).
This disgraceful state of affairs must be stopped at all costs! Further.
We absolutely insist on the necessity of fully clear­ ing up our position in the fight against the Martovists, of ar­ riving at complète agreement and of adopting a very definite line.
Why have you not sent Boris here as Hans wanted to when he was here? After being here Boris would not go on writing these absurd speeches about peace.
Why has not Hans kept his promise to send the Old Man * a precise account of Boris’ state of mind? If you cannot send Boris, send Mitrofan* or Zver5 to carry on the work.
I repeat again and again: Hans’ principal mistake is that he goes on trusting Ins last impression.
No.
53 should have brought him back to his senses.
The Martovists captured the C.
O.
in order to wage war, and now war has broken out all along the line: baiting in Iskra? the fight at the public lectures (the other day Martov, in Paris, lectured on the split before an audience of a hundred and had a fight with Lebedev**), the most bare­ faced agitation against the €.

Over here things have come to a breach of relations between the C.
O.
and the C.
C.
(resolution of the C.
O.
of December 22 which has been sent to you*), to the publication of lies in the C.
O.
(No.
55 of Iskra) to die effect that an agreement has been reached not to publish a report of the negotiations.
** It is time you gave serious thought to the whole political situation; you must take a broader view, abstract yourselves from the petty day-to-day troubles with pence and passports and, instead of hiding your heads under your wings, make clear to yourselves where you are going and why you arc messing around with this.
If I am not mistaken there are two tendencies in our C.
C.
(or are there three? In that case what are they?).
In my opin­ ion they are the following: 1) to procrastinate in the matter and put off calling a congress, while as far as possible bearing their attacks and their insolent spitting in our faces in silence, and to strengthen the position in Russia; 2) to raise a storm of resolutions against the C.
O.
, concentrating all forces on win­ ning over the vacillating committees, and to get ready for a congress in two, at the maximum three, months.
Now I ask you, what does your strengthening of positions amount to? It merely amounts to your losing time while the enemy gathers his forces over here (and the forces abroad mean a great deal!) and putting off your decision until your arrest.
Arrest is inevitable, and that very soon—it wrould be childish to ignore it.
What will you leave us with when you are arrested? The Martovists have fresh and growing forces.
We have nothing but broken ranks.
They have a strengthened C.
O.
We have a set of people engaged in inefficiently transporting a C.
O.
which does nothing but abuse them.
This is the way to certain defeat! This is nothing but shamefully and stupidly deferring inevitable defeat.
You are content to shut your eyes to these things, taking advantage of the fact that the war is only slowly spreading to you from abroad.
For your tactics literally come to this: after us (after the present C.
C.
), the deluge (deluge for the ma­ jority).
1 think that even if defeat is inevitable we must withdraw frankly, honestly and openly, and this can only be done at a congress.
But defeat is by no means inevitable, because the Five are not agreed among themselves.
Plekhanov is not with them, but for peace, and a congress could put the blanket on both Plekhanov and them with their alleged dissensions.
The only serious argument against a congress is that it would inevitably legalise the split.
And I reply to this: 1) even that would be better than what we have now, because then we could withdraw honourably and not prolong this humiliating position of being spat at; 2) the Martovists have missed the opportunity for a split, and it is unlikely that they will withdraw from the Third Congress, for the present struggle and publication in full1 precludes the possibility of a split; 3) if we must bargain with them the best place to do so would be at the congress.
Think this matter over seriously and do reply, giving the opinion of each (without fail, of each) member of the C.

Geneva, January 2, 1904.
Post sert plum: I have just received the proofs of Axelrod’s article for No.
55 of Iskra (No.
55 will be out in two days).
It is far more despicable than Martov’s article (“Our Con­ gress”) in No.
53.
It contains such things as “ambitious phanta­ sies,” “inspired by the traditions of the dictatorship of Schwei­ zer”**; accusations to the effect that “an omniscient centre” “at its personal [sic/] discretion disposes of” “Party members who have been turned [ ! ! ] into screws and cogwheels” ; “the setting up of innumerable ministries, departments, sections, of­ fices, workshops”; the transformation of revolutionaries (that is exactly what he says!) “into heads of offices, clerks, sergeant-majors, N.

” Such, we are told, is the “organisational utopia of a theocratic character” (sic/)* “The triumph of a bureaucratic centralism in the Party organisation—such is the sum total .

” (this is exactly what he says!).
This article makes me appeal again and again to all the members of the CXL: can this be left without a protest and without a struggle? Don’t you realise that by submitting to this you become nothing more nor less than peddlars of scandal (about Schweizer and his pawns) and circulators of calumny (about bureaucrats, i.
e.
, about yourselves and the whole majority)? Do you believe it is possible to carry on “positive work” under an “ideological leadership” of this sort? Or do you know of any other way of waging an honest fight than by convening a congress?? (The Martovists appear to have Kiev, Kharkov, the mining district, Rostov and the Crimea behind them.
That makes ten votes + the Leagued-the editors of the C.

If we concertlnate all our forces on Nikolayev, Siberia and the Caucasus at once, we can easily keep them with one-third.
*) TO MEMBERS OF THE PARTY* A circle or a party? This is the question our €.
0.
has sub­ mitted for discussion.
We are of the opinion that the question has been raised at a very opportune moment.
We invite the editors of our C.
O.
to be­ gin by taking a look at themselves.
What is this editorial board? Is it a circle of persons who have lived together for such and such a number of years and have nowr attained the post of editors by means of boycott, of disruptive work and of threats of a split, or is it a body of officials of our Party? Do not try to evade the question by arguing that you were co-opted legally, in accordance with the rules.
We do not ques­ tion the legality of it; we invite you not to confine yourselves to the formal point of view, but to answer the essence of our question.
We want, not merely a juridical, but a political answer.
We want an answer from you, gentlemen, who were never elected by «the Congress and never appointed by the Party to be editors, and not from Comrade Plekhanov, who, perhaps, had no alternative but to co-opt you in order to avoid a split.
A circle or a body of Party officials? If you are a circle, «then why all this hypocrisy and sham, all these phrases about a party? Have you not broken up tha* Party, and spent weeks and months mocking at its institutions and its rules? Did you not tear the decisions of the Second Con­ gress of that Party to bits, did you not bring matters to the point of a split, did you not refuse to submit to the C.
C.
and to the Council? Have you not placed yourselves outside the Party by all this talk about your not regarding Party congresses as being divine, i.
e,, as binding? You trample upon the institu­ tions and the laws of the Party and at the same time you are pleased to put the sub-title “Central Parly Organ” in the head­ ing of your paper.
395 But if you are the officials of the Parly, would you mind ex­ plaining to the Party why, and in the name of what, persons who were never appointed by the Congress should try to obtain posts for themselves in a central institution of the Party? Perhaps to preserve the “continuity” of the family circle of editors? And those who voted for resolutions in favour of this philistine “continuity” at the Congress of the League * now want to bamboozle us with talk about the Party! Have you any right to talk about the Party? You call those who take their stand on the formal decisions of the Second Congress formalists—because you must blur and gloss over the fact that you betrayed the trust of your com­ rades, who, everyone of them, over and over again, pledged themselves to obey the decisions of the Congress/* You do not submit to formal decisions when they are against you, but al the same time you unblushingly invoke the formal rights of the League when those rights are to your advantage, you invoke the formal decisions of the Council of the Party because, against the will of the Party, you have succeeded in getting into this body, the supreme body of the Party.
You call those who occupy a Parly appointment by the will of the Party Congress, and not by the caprice of a group of emigrant journalists, bureaucrats.
But you do this in order to conceal the disagreeable fact that it is precisely those who are quite unable to work in the Party unless they are members of the central Party institutions who are saturated with the spirit of bureaucracy, with the spirit of precedence, with the spiril of hunting for honours.
Yes, your behaviour has indeed opened our eyes to the fact that our Party suffers from a bureaucracy that places office above work and shuns neither boycott nor dis­ ruption in the effort to get into office.
You say that a decision of the Party Congress arrived at by a majority is crudely mechanical, but do not the methods of struggle employed in the colonies abroad, and in the League which assured you your shameful victory over our Party editor­ ial board, appear to you to be crudely mechanical and scandal­ ous? You do not see anything pharisaical in the assurances that they recognise the Party made by those who have striven for and have obtained control of the central Party organ although they were a minor Uy at the Party Congress! And you call these hypocritical efforts to whitewash your in­ decent, anli-Party behaviour, this preaching of anarchy, these insults hurled at the Party Congress, these opportunist efforts Io justify philistinism and the circle spirit—you call this your new organisational point of view! Comrades! Those who seriously regard themselves as mem­ bers of the Party must raise an emphatic protest and put a stop to this shameful state of affairs! Those who seriously regard Iskras three years of work and the Party Congress which it prepared and which gave expression to the will of those Rus­ sian Social-Democrats who are really men of conviction and principles and who are really working—these will never allow the circle spirit abroad to trample upon all that the Congress achieved.
One of two things: Either we have no Party and are utterly in the power of a group of journalists abroad, of a circle of editors which was rejected by our Congress—in that case, down with this hypocritical talk about a party, down with the false headings on uwParty” publications, organs and institutions! We are not Socialist-Revolutionaries, we have no use for painted scenery.
The party of the proletariat demands the truth.
The party of die proletariat demands the ruthlessly outspoken ex­ posure of the obsolete circle spirit.
Let us have the courage to admit that there is no Party and set to work to make and strengthen a real party from the beginning, from the very be­ ginning.
We shall not be deterred by the temporary victory of the circle spirit, we believe and we know that the class con­ scious Russian proletariat will succeed in building for itself a real party and not a parly in name only, a party that is a party because it has real party institutions and not because it uses false headings.
Or we have a party—and in that case, down with all circle interests, down with meetings of rowdies abroad! In that case those who were never appointed editors by our Party Congress must resign al once from our Party editorial board.
In that case the editorial board of the central organ, consisting of comrade« elected at the Congress, must be restored.
In that case, let our Party organ advocate the views of the Party majority, let our Party organ defend the Party organisation and the Party in­ stitutions instead of trampling them in the mud.
Down with the circle spirit and, first of all, down with it on our Parly editorial board! Down with disrupters! Long live the party of the proletariat, the party that is able in practice to obey the decisions of the Party Congress and to respect Party discipline and organisation! Down with pharisaic talk and false headings! January 1904.
LETTER TO THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE For the C.
C.
(To be handed over to N.
N.
1) Geneva, January 31, 1904.
Yesterday the meetings (three) of the Party Council came to an end.
These meetings throw a definite light on the whole polit­ ical situation in the Farty.
Plekhanov has joined the Martovists, and they are steam-rolling us on all issues of any importance.
Our resolution condemning boycott, etc.
(boycott on both sides), was not put to the vote: the only tiling adopted was a resolu­ tion drawing a distinction in principle between permissible and impermissible methods of struggle.
Instead, a resolution pro­ posed by Plekhanov was passed to the effect that it is desirable that the C.
C.
co-opt a corresponding (sic!) number of members of the minority.
After that we withdrew our resolution and entered a protest; we expressed opposition to this policy of settl­ ing accounts in disputes over precedence on the Council.
Three members of the Council (Martov, Axelrod and Plekhanov) re­ plied that it was “below their dignity1’ to examine our protest.
We declared that a congress is the only honest way out.
The Council killed the motion.
Three members passed resolutions making it legal (!) for the editorial board to send out its repre­ sentatives independently of die C.
C.
and instructing the C.
C.
to supply the editorial board with literature in the quantity re­ quired for distribution (!!).
This means supplying them with literature for them to transport and distribute, because they have been dispatching “agent” after “agent” who refuse to accept commissions from the C.
C.
Besides, they have the means of transport ready (it was suggested that half and half be carried).

399 An article by Plekhanov appeared in Iskra (No.
57) in which he calls our C.
C.
eccentric1 (it includes no representative of the minority) and proposes that such representatives be co­ opted.
* How many, we are not told; according to private in­ formation, no less than three out of a very restricted list (five or six, it would seem), possibly accompanied by the demand that someone on the C.
C.
resign.
One must be blind not to see by now what the game is.
The Council will go on exercising pressure on the C.
C.
by every possible means, demanding complete surrender to the Martov­ ists.
Either an immediate congress, the immediate collection of resolutions calling for a congress from eleven or twelve com­ mittees, the immediate concentration of all forces on agitation for a congress; or the resignation of the whole C.
C.
, because no one on the C.
C.
will agree to play the degrading, ridiculous role of having to accept people who thrust themselves on one and will not be satisfied until they have control of everything and who, to have their way, will drag every triviality before the Council.
j Kurtz 2 and I insistently demand that the C.
C.
meet at once at all costs and settle the matter, taking our votes into account, of course.
We insistently repeat for the hundredth time: either an immediate congress, or resignation.
We invite those who do not agree with us to come over here and judge on the spot.
Let them try to get on with the Martovists in practice, instead of writing empty phrases on the benefits of peace.
We have no money.
The C.
O.
heaps expenses on us with the obvious intention of driving us into bankruptcy, and with the ob­ vious hope that a financial crash will follow, in order that they may be able to take emergency measures that would reduce the C.
C.
to nought.
Two or three thousand rubles are wanted immediately and at all costs, without fail and without delay; otherwise, in a month's time, the crash will be complete.

Lenin H LETTER TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN RUSSIA* The Old Man1 writing.
I have read the letters of Zemlyachka and Konyagin.
’ Allah only knows where he got the idea that I had realised the uselessness of a congress.
On the contrary, I continue to insist that .
this is the only honest way out, and that only shortsightedness and cowardice can shrink from this con­ clusion.
I continue to insist that Boris, Mitrofan and Horsea should be sent here without fail, because you people must see the situation wdth your own eyes (especially as it stands after the meeting of the Council), and not spin yarns from afar, hid­ ing your heads under your wings and taking advantage of the fact that it takes years to get from here to the C.
C.
even on the fastest steed.
Nothing is more absurd than the notion that preparatory work for the congress, agitation in the committees, passing sensible and emphatic (and not sloppy) resolutions in the committees, precludes “positive” work, or is in contradiction to it.
This notion only reveals an inability to underetand the political situation that has matured in the Party.
The Party has been practically broken up, the rules have bee?) converted into a rag, the organisation has been spat upon— only complacent Poshekhonians 4 can still fail to see this.
Those who understand this must realise that the Martovist offensive must be met with an offensive (and not with banal talk about peace, etc.
).
All our forces must be employed for the offensive.
Technical work, transport, receiving literature must be left en-1 Lenin.

402 LETTER TO MEMBERS OF CENTRAL COMMITTEE403 lirely to auxiliary forces, assistants, agents.
It is extremely ir­ rational to put members of the C.
C.
on this work.
* The members of the C.
C.
must capture all the committees, mobilise a major­ ity, travel round Russia, unite our people, lead an offensive (in answer to the attacks of the Martovists), an offensive against the C.
O.
, a bombardment of resolutions: 1) demanding a con« gress; 2) asking the editors of the C.
O.
whether they intend to submit to the Congress on the question of the constitution of the editorial board; 3) condemning the new Iskra without “philistine tenderness,” as was done the other day by Astrakhan, by Tver and by the Urals.
** These resolutions must be printed in Russia, we have already said this a hundred times.
I believe our C.
C.
really consists of bureaucrats and formal­ ists, and not of revolutionaries.
The Martovists spit into their ugly mugs, and they only go on wiping their faces and lectur­ ing me, saying: “It is no use fighting.
” Only bureaucrats can fail to see that the C.
C.
is not a C.
C.
and that its fruitless ef­ forts to be one are simply ridiculous.
Either the C.
C.
becomes an organisation for war against the CX).
, a war in fact and not in name, a war waged in the committees, or the C.
C.
is a worth­ less rag which only deserves to be cast away.
For Christ’s sake, will you understand that centralism has been wrecked beyond repair by the Martovists.
Cut out all these idiotic formalities, capture the committees, teach them to fight for the Party against the circle spirit abroad, write leaflets for them (this will not prevent agitation for the Congress, it will help it), put auxiliary forces on technical work.
Be lead­ ers in the war against the C.
O.
or else give up all comic pre­ tensions to be “leading” others by wiping spittle from your faces.

ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO STEPS BACK THE CRISIS IN OUR PARTY Preface When a prolonged, stubborn and fierce struggle has been go­ ing on for some time there comes a moment when the central and fundamental points at issue, upon the solution of which the ultimate outcome of the compaign depends, and before which all the minor and petty episodes of the struggle begin to recede into the background, begin to assume definite outline.
That is how the matter stands with regard to the struggle in­ side our Parly that has been riveting the attention of all Party members for the past six months.
And precisely because in the present study I have had to allude to many points of detail which are only of infinitesimal interest and to many squabbles which at bottom are of no interest whatever, I should like from the very outset to draw the reader’s attention to the two points which are really central and fundamental, which are of tremen­ dous interest, which unquestionably possess historic significance and which are the most' essential political questions at issue in our Party.
The first question is that of the political significance of the division of our Party into a “majority” and a “minority” which took shape at the Second Party Congress and which relegated all previous divisions among Russian Social-Democrats far into die background.
The second question is, what significance in principle is to be attached to the position taken up by the new Iskra* on ques­ tions of organisation, in so far as this position is actually one of principle? The first question is the question of the starting point of the 407 struggle in our Party, its source, its causes and its fundamental political character.
The second question is the question of the ultimate result of the struggle, its finale, the sum total of prin­ ciples that will result from adding up all that is connected with principles and subtracting all that is connected with squabbles.
The answer to the first question is obtained by analysing the struggle at the Parly Congress; the answer to the second is ob­ tained by analysing what is new in the principles of the new Iskra, This twofold analysis, which takes up nine-tenths of my pamphlet, leads to the conclusion that the “majority” is the rev­ olutionary and the “minority,” the opportunist wing of our Party; at present the dissensions that divide the two wings are for the most part only questions of organisation, and not of the programme or of tactics; the new system of views of the new Iskra—which emerges all the more clearly, the more it tries to deepen its position and the more that position is purged of all these squabbles about co-optation—is opportunism on questions of organisation.
The principal shortcoming of the existing literature on the crisis in our Party, as regards the study and the interpretation of facts, is that the minutes of the Party Congress have prac­ tically not been analysed and.
as far as the elucidation of funda­ mental principles on questions of organisation is concerned, that no analysis has been made of the connection which unques­ tionably exists between the basic error Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod make in their formulation of point 1 of the rules and the defence of that formula, on tire one hand, and the whole “system” (in so far as one can speak of a system) of present principles of Iskra on the question of organisation, on the other.
The present editors of Iskra do not seem to notice this connection, although in the writings of the “majority” atten­ tion has again and again been drawn to the importance of the dispute over point 1.
As a matter of fact, Comrade Axelrod and Comrade Martov have only been deepening, developing and ex­ tending their initial error in connection with point 1.
As a mat­ ter of fact, the entire position of the opportunists in questions of organisation began to be revealed in the course of the con­ troversy over point 1: their advocacy of a diffuse and loose Party organisation; their hostility to the idea (the “bureaucratic” idea) of building the Party from above, starting from the Party Congress and the bodies emanating from the latter; their tend­ ency to proceed from below, a tendency which would allow every professor, every schoolboy and “every striker” to register himself as a member of the Party; their hostility to the “form­ alism” which demands that a Party member belong to an organ­ isation recognised by the Party; their inclination towards the mentality of the bourgeois intellectual who is only prepared “platonically to recognise organisational relations”; their weak­ ness for opportunist profundity and for anarchist phrases; their partiality for autonomism as against centralism—in a word, all that which has blossomed out so luxuriantly in the new Iskra, and is helping more and more to explain, completely and graph­ ically, the initial error.
As for the minutes of the Party Congress, the utterly unde­ served lack of attention shown to them can only be accounted for by the way our controversies have been choked by our squabbles, and possibly by the fact that those minutes contain a considerable amount of unpalatable truth.
The minutes of the Party Congress present a picture of the actual state of affairs in our Party that is unique and incomparable for precision, com­ pleteness, all-sidedness, wealth and authenticity, a picture of views, moods and plans drawn by the participants in the move­ ment themselves, a picture of the political nuances existing in­ side the Party, showing their relative strength, their mutual re­ lationships and their struggles.
It is the minutes of the Party Congress, and only these minutes, that show to what extent we have really succeeded in making a clean sweep of all the surviv­ als of the old circle links and in substituting for them a single great Partv link.
It is the duty of every Party member who wishes to take an intelligent part in the affairs of our Party to study the Party Congress attentively; I insist on this word “study,” because the mere perusal of the heap of raw material contained in the minutes does not give a picture of the Con­ gress.
Only by dint of careful and independent study can one (and must one) reach a stage where the short summaries of the speeches, the dry excerpts from the debates, the petty skirmishes on minor (seemingly minor) issues will combine to form one whole, and enable the Party member to see with hie own eyes the living figure of each important speaker and to discern the political complexion of each group of delegates at the Congress.
If the writer of these lines succeeds in giving the reader even a slight impetus to undertake an extensive and independent study of the minutes of the Party Congress, he will not regard his work as having been in vain.
One more word to the opponents of Social-Democracy.
They gloat and grimace over our controversies; and, of course, they will try to pick isolated passages from my pamphlet, which deals with the defects and shortcomings of our Party, and to use them for their own ends.
The Russian Social-Democrats have already been sufficiently steeled in battle not to let themselves be per­ turbed by these pinpricks and to continue, in spile of them, with their work of self-criticism and of ruthlessly exposing their own shortcomings, which will inevitably and certainly be overcome as the working class movement grows.
As for our opponents, let them first attempt to draw a picture of the true state of affairs in their own “parties” that would even remotely resemble the one that is revealed by the minutes of our Second Congress.

May 1904.

Preparations for the Congress There is a saying that everyone is entitled to curse his judges for twenty-four hours.
Like every congress of every party, our Party Congress had to act as judge in respect of certain persons who aspired to leadership but suffered defeat.
Today these members of the “minority” are “cursing their judges” with a naivete that verges on the pathetic, and they are making every effort to discredit the Congress, to minimise its importance and Us prestige.
This attitude has found what is probably its most vivid expression in the article by “Practical Worker” in No.
57 of Iskra, in which the author is “revolted” at the idea of the sovereign “divinity” of a congress.
This is so characteristic a trait of the new Iskra that it cannot be ignored.
The editors, most of whom are persons who were rejected by the Congress, continue on the one hand to call themselves an editorial board of the “Party/’ while, on the other hand, they accept with open arms those who assert that the Congress is not divine.
Nice, is it not? Yes, gentlemen, a congress, of course, is not divine; but what must we think of those who begin to “abuse” a congress after they have suffered defeat at this congress? Indeed, let us recall the main facts of the wray the Congress was prepared.
At the very outset, Iskra, in its announcement in 1900, which preceded the publication of that paper, declared that we must first separate and then unite.
Iskra tried to convert the Con­ ference of 1902 into a private meeting and not a Party con­ gress.
* In the summer and autumn of 1902 Iskra acted with ex­ treme caution when it revived the Organisation Committee that was elected at that conference.
At last the work of dividing was finished—as was generally admitted.
An Organisation Committee was set up towards the very end of 1902.
Iskra welcomed its consolidation and, in an editorial article in No.
32, declared that the calling of a Party congress was a matter of the most urgent and immediate necessity.
Hence, the last thing we can be accused of is of having been in too great a hurry in conven­ ing the Second Congress.
We acted according to the rule: “measure your cloth seven times before cutting”; we had every moral right to believe that our comrades would not start com­ plaining and re-measuring after the thing had been cut.
The Organisation Committee drew up a very elaborate set of standing orders (formalistic and bureaucratic, those would say who now use these words to conceal their political flabbiness) for the Second Congress, got it passed by all the committees and, at last, sanctioned it, one of the provisions being that con­ tained in point 18: “All the decisions of the Congress and all the elections carried out by it are the decisions of the Party and are binding on all the organisations of the Party.
They cannot be appealed against by anyone on any pretext and can only be revoked or modified by the next congress of the Party.
” These words, which were adopted in silence at the time as something self-evident, look innocent enough by themselves, do they not? But how strange they sound today—like a verdict pronounced against the “minority”! Why was this point included? Was it just for the sake of formality? By no means.
The prevision seemed necessary, and w*as in fact necessary, because the Party consisted of a number of isolated and independent groups, which could be expected to refuse to recognise the Congress.
This pro­ vision expressed the good will of all revolutionaries (there is a great deal of irrelevant talk about it today, because the term good is euphemistically applied to what really deserves the epithet capricious).
It was equivalent to a word of honour, mutually pledged by all Russian Social-Democrats.
It was in­ tended as a guarantee that the tremendous labours, dangers and expense entailed by the Congress would not be wasted, and that the Congress would not be turned into a farce.
It qualified be­ forehand every refusal to recognise the decisions of and the elections at the Congress as a breach of faith.
Whom, then, is the new Iskra holding up to ridicule when it makes the discovery that the Congress is not divine and its de­ cisions not sacred? Does this discovery imply “new views on organisation” or only new attempts to cover up old tracks? b.
The Significance of the Various Groups at the Congress Thus, the Congress wTas called after very careful preparation had been made and on the basis of complete representation.
It was generally recognised that the Congress as constituted was valid and that its decisions were absolutely binding; and this recognition was voiced in a statement of the chairman * (Min­ utes, p.
54) after the Congress had constituted itself.
What was the principal task of the Congress? It was to create a real party on the basis of the principles and methods of organ­ isation that had been advocated and elaborated by Iskra.
That this was the direction in which the Congress had to work had been predetermined by Iskra’s three years of effort and by the fact that this work had won the recognition of most of the com­ mittecs.
Iskra's programme and policy were to become the pro­ gramme and policy of the Parly; Iskras organisational plans were to materialise in the rules on organisation of the Party.
But needless to say, this result could not be obtained without a fight: the completely representative character of the Congress secured the presence of organisations which had definitely fought Iskra (the Bund and Rabocheye Dyelo) and of organisations which, although they nominally recognised Iskra as the leading organ, in actual fact pursued plans of their own and were dis­ tinguished by a lack of steadiness in mailers of principle (the Yuzhny Rabochy group and several committee delegates who adhered to it).
In these circumstances the Congress could not avoid becoming a field of battle for the victory of the “Iskra”-ist cause.
That the Congress did actually become such a field of battle will at once be clear to anyone who reads the minutes al all attentively.
Our present lask is to trace in detail the principal groups that were formed on the various issues at the Congress and to reconstruct, with the aid of the precise evidence of the minutes, the political complexion of each of the main groups.
What precisely did those groups, those shades of opinion and those tendencies dial were going to unite in one party at the Congress under the leadership of Iskra stand for? This is the question we must answer by analysing the debates and votes.
The elucidation of this point is of cardinal importance if wTe wish to know what our Social-Democrats really are and if we wish to understand the causes of the dissensions in their midst.
That is why, when I spoke at the League, as well as in the letter I wrote to the editors of the new Iskra, I insisted above all on the analysis of the various groups.
My opponents, the representatives of the “minority” (and Martov al their head), utterly failed to understand the essence of the question.
At the Congress of the League they confined themselves to rectifications of detail, trying to “defend” themselves against the charge raised against them that they were heading towards opportunism; but they made no attempt to draw any other picture of the groups at the Congress in opposition to mine.
Since then Martov has attempted in Iskra (No.
56) to represent all the attempts clearly to delimit the various political groups at the Congress as mere “circle polit­ ics.
” That is strong language, Comrade Martov! But in the new Iskra strong words are all marked by one peculiar feature: it is enough to reproduce all the stages of the divergence, from the Congress onwards, for all these strong words to be turned completely and primarily against the present editors.
Look at yourselves, gentlemen, you so-called Party editors who want to talk about circle politics! Martov finds the facts of our struggle at the Congress so un­ pleasant that he tries to slur over them altogether.
“An Iskra* ist,” he says, “is one who, at the Party Congress and before it, expressed his complete solidarity with Iskra, advocated its pro­ gramme and its views on organisation and supported its organ­ isational policy.
There were over forty Iskra-ists answering to this description at the Congress—for that was the number of votes given for Iskra's programme and for the resolution re­ cognising Iskra as the central organ of the Party.
” If you look into the minutes of the Congress you will see that the pro­ gramme was accepted by all votes (p.
2$3), except Akimov who abstained.
Thus, Comrade Martov wants to convince us that the Bundists and Brooker and Martynov proved their complete solidarity with Iskra and defended its organisational views.
This is ridiculous.
The fact that after the Congress all those who attended it became equal members of the Party (and even then not all, for the Bundists withdrew) is confused with the align­ ment of groups that was the cause of the struggle at the Con­ gress.
The official phrase, “recognised the programme,” is thus substituted for a study of the elements that comprised the “majority” and the “minority” after the Congress.
Take the voting on the question of recognising Iskra as the central organ.
You will see that it was none other than Marty­ nov—whom Comrade Martov, with a courage worthy of a better cause, describes as supporting Iskras organisational viewrs and organisational policy—'who insisted on dividing the resolu­ tion into two parts, the bare recognition of Iskra as the central organ and the recognition of its services.
When the first part of the resolution was put to the vote (recognition of the services of Iskra, expressing solidarity with it) there were only thirty-five votes in favour; two voted against (Akimov and Brooker), while eleven abstained (Martynov, the five Bundists and the five votes of the editors: Martov and I with two votes each and Plekhanov with one).
Even this case, which is most advantage­ ous for Martov’s views and which he chose himself, reveals quite clearly the nature of the anti-/sAra group (five Bundists, three Rabocheye DyeZo-ists).
Now take the voting for the second part of the resolution—the recognition of Iskra as the central organ without giving reasons and without any expression of solidar­ ity (Minutes, p.
147): forty-four votes in favour, all of which Martov now ascribes to the Iskra-isXs.
The total number of votes wras fifty-one; subtracting the five votes of the editors who ab­ stained, we get forty-six; two voted against (Akimov and Brooker); consequently, the remaining forty-four include the five Bundists.
Hence, at the Congress, the Bundists “expressed complete solidarity with Iskra”—thus is official history written by the official Iskral Let us anticipate a little and explain to the reader the real reasons for this official version of the truth: the present editorial board of Iskra could have become and would have become a Party editorial board in reality (and not a quasi­ Party editorial board, as it is today) had the Bundists and “Rabocheye Dy el odists not left the Congress; that is why these most trusty guardians of the present, so-called Party editorial board had to be described as AsAra-ists.
But I shall return to this point further on in greater detail.
The next question is this: if the struggle at the Congress was between ZsAra-ists and anti-/sAra-ists, were there no intermed­ iate, unstable elements that vacillated between the two sides? Anyone who is at all familiar with our Parly and with the usual complexion of all congresses would be inclined a priori to an­ swer the question in the affirmative.
Comrade Martov does not like to be reminded of these unstable elements, so he presents the Yuzhny Rabochy group and the delegates who gravitated towards it as typical Iskra-ists, and our differences with them as slight and unimportant Fortunately, we have before us the complete text of the minutes and we are in a position to answer the question, which is of course a question of fact, on the basis of documentary evidence.
What we have said of the general grouping at the Congress does not, of course, pretend to solve the problem, but only to formulate it correctly.
Until wre have analysed the political groups, until we have obtained a picture of the Congress as a struggle between de­ finite political shades, nothing can be understood about our dif­ ferences.
Martov’s attempt to slur over the difference in polit­ ical shades by ranking even the Bundists with the Iskra-ists is merely an evasion of the question.
Even a priori, starling from the history of Russian Social-Democracy before the Congress, three main groups stand out for subsequent verification and detailed study: the Iskra-ists, the anti-/s£ra-ists and the unstable, vacillating, wavering elements? n.
General View of the Struggle at the Congress The Revolutionary and the Opportunist Wings of the Party Now that we have finished analysing the debates and the votes of the Congress, we must sum up, so that, on the basis of the whole of the Congress material, we may answer the question: what elements, groups and shades comprised the majority and the minority in the final form in which they appeared at the elec­ tions and which was to become, for a time, the main division in the Party? We must sum up all the evidence on the various shades of opinion concerning matters of principle, theory and tactics with which the minutes of the Congress provide us in such abundance.
Without a general “summary,” without a gen­ eral picture of the Congress as a whole, and of all its principal groups al the voting, these data remain too disjointed, too dis­ connected, so that at first sight the grouping appears to be ac­ cidental, especially to one who does not take the trouble to study the minutes of the Congress (and how many readers have taken the trouble to do so?).
In English parliamentary reports we often find the character­ istic word “division.
” The House “divided” into such and such 1 Sections c, D.

—Ed.
a majority and minority—is the expression used in speaking of taking a vote on an issue.
The “division” of our Social-Demo* cratic House on the various issues discussed at the Congress presents a picture of the struggle inside the Party, of its shades of opinion and groups, that is unique and incomparable for its completeness and precision.
To make the picture more striking, to obtain a real picture, instead of a heap of disconnected, dis* jointed and isolated facts, to put an end to the endless and senseless controversies over separate divisions (who voted for whom and who supported whom), I have decided to try to re­ present all the basic types of “division” at our Congress in the form of a diagram.
This at first will probably seem strange to very many people, but I doubt whether there is any better method that would really generalise and sum up the results in the most complete and accurate way possible.
In all cases when the votes were taken by roll call, it can be determined with com­ plete accuracy whether a given delegate voted for or against a given motion; likewise, in certain important cases when the vote was not taken by roll call, the minutes enable us to answer the question with a very great degree of probability, with a suffi­ cient degree of approximation to the truth.
If, at the same time, we take into account all the divisions by roll call and all the other divisions on issues of any importance (which can be measured by the length and heatedness of the debates), we shall obtain a picture of the struggle inside our Party that will be as objective as is obtainable with the material at our disposal.
In doing this, instead of trying to give a photographic representa­ tion, i.
e.
, instead of representing every division separately, we shall try to give a picture, i.
e.
, to present all the main types of division, and leave out relatively unimportant exceptions and variations winch would only serve to confuse the matter.
In any case, with the aid of the minutes it will be possible for anyone to check every detail of our picture, to fill it in with individual divisions, in a word, to criticise it not only by arguing, express­ ing doubt and picking out isolated cases, but by drawing up a different picture with the aid of the same material.
In marking on the diagram every delegate who took part in 27 Lenin II a division we shall indicate by a special shading the four main groups which we have traced in detail throughout the course of the debates at the Congress, viz.
,: 1) Iskra-ists of the major­ ity; 2) Iskra-ists of the minority; 3) centre, and 4) anti-ZsArra-ists.
We have seen that in a number of instances these groups were distinguished by shades of difference in matters of principle, and if anyone objects to the name given to each group, which, reminds the zigzag lovers too much of Iskra and of Iskra's line of policy, we shall remark that it is not the name that matters.
Now that the shades of opinion have been traced through all the debates at the Congress it is easy to substitute for the Party nicknames that have become established and familiar (but which jar on the ears of certain people) a descrip­ tion of the essential differences between the groups.
This substitu­ tion would result in the following names for the same four groups: 1) consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats; 2) minor opportun­ ists; 3) middling opportunists, and 4) major opportunists (ma­ jor, according to our Russian standards).
Let us hope that these names will be less shocking to those who for some time have been trying to convince themselves and others that Iskra-ist is a name denoting only a “circle” and not a line of policy.
We shall now proceed to explain in detail the types of di­ vision that have been “marked” on this diagram.
[See page 419.
] The first type of division (A) covers cases when the centre voted with the Iskra-ists against the anti-ZsAjra-ists or against a section of the latter.
It includes the division on the programme as a whole (Comrade Akimov alone abstained, all the others voted in favour); the division on the resolution condemning federation in principle (all in favour, except the five Bundists); the vote on point 2 of the rules of the Bund (against us the five Bundists; five abstentions, viz.
: Martynov, Akimov, Brooker and Makhov, the latter with two votes; the rest were with us); it is this latter division that is represented in the diagram under A.
There were three more divisions of the same type on the question of endorsing Iskra as the central organ of the Party, the editors (five votes) abstaining; in all three divisions two voted against (Akimov and Brooker) and, in addition, when the vote on rea-Genkai.

1 Thia type of division provides an answer to the very Interest­ ing and important question, viz.
, in which cases did the “centre*’ vote with the Iskra-ists? Either when even the anti-“Iskra”-ists, with a few exceptions, were with us (recognition of the pro­ gramme, endorsement of Iskra irrespective of motives), or else when the issue was a statement that by itself did not yet com­ mit one to a definite political position (the recognition of the 1 Why did I take the vote on point 2 of the rules of the Bund as an illustration for the diagram? Because the votes on the question of en­ dorsing Iskra were less complete, while the votes on the programme and on the question of federation refer to political decisions of a less con­ cretely defined character.
Speaking generally, the choice of one of a num­ ber of divisions of the same type will not in the least affect the essential features of the picture, as anyone may easily be convinced after making the necessary changes.
organising work of Iskra does not yet commit one to carrying out its organisational policy in respect of every given group; the rejection of the principle of federation does not prevent one from abstaining when the issue is a concrete scheme of federa­ tion, as we have seen in the case of Comrade Makhov).
When speaking of the groups at the Congress in general, we saw how false was the impression given in the official Iskra account whicli (with Comrade Martov for its spokesman) blurs and glosses over die difference between the Iskra-iste and the “centre,’' between the consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats and the opportunists, by quoting cases when the anti“Iskra'-ists were with us! Even die most “Right-wing” of the German and French opportunists in the Social-Democratic Parties never vote against such points as the recognition of the programme as a whole.
The second type of division (B) covers those cases when the consistent and the inconsistent Iskra-ists voted together against all die anti-/sAra-ists and the whole “centre.
” In those cases the issue, for the most pant, was whether to carry out the definite concrete plans of the Iskra policy, whether to endorse Iskra in deeds and not only in words.
These cases include the O.

in­ cident1; whether to put the question of the position of the Bund in the Parly as the first item on the agenda; the dissolution of the Yuzhny Rabochy group; two divisions on the agrarian pro­ gramme, and, finally, sixth, voting against the League of Rus­ sian Social-Democrats Abroad (Rabocheye Dyelo), i.
e.
, the re­ cognition of the League 2 as the only Party organisation outside 1 It is this division that is reproduced in diagram B: the Iskra-ists had thirty-two votes, sixteen voted for the Bund resolution.
It may be pointed out that none of the divisions of this type were by roll call.
The way the individual delegates voted can only be established with a very great de­ gree of probability by two sets of evidence: 1) in the debate the speak­ ers of both Iskra sections spoke in favour, those of the anti-fsArro-ists and of the centre—against; 2) the number of votes in favour was always very close to the figure 33.
It must not be forgotten that when we analysed the debates at the Congress we pointed out a number of cases, besides divisions, when the “centre” voted with the anti/sZcra-ists (with the op­ portunists) against us.
Such cases were: the question of the absolute value of democratic demands, of supporting the opposition elements, of limiting centralism, etc.

In oases like these the old, pre-Party circle spirit, the interests of the opportunist organisations and of little groups, a narrow interpretation of Marxism were set up against the steady, principled and consistent policy of revolutionary Social-Demo­ cracy; the Iskra-ists of the minority were with us in a number of cases, in a number of exceedingly important divisions (im­ portant from the point of view of die O.
C.
, of Yuzhny Rabochy and of Rabocheye Dyelo)—until it came to their own circle spirit, to their own inconsistencies.
The “divisions” of this type make it clear that in a number of issues that related to the prac­ tical application of our principles, the centre voted with the anti-“Iskra"-ists, thus showing itself to be much more akin to them than to us, much more inclined in practice towards the oppor­ tunist than towards the revolutionary wing of Social-Democracy.
These /sfcra-ists, who are Iskra-ists, in name, but are ashamed to be /sAra-ists, revealed their true nature; the struggle that inevi­ tably ensued introduced much irritation, which often obscured from the less thoughtful and more impressionable the signifi­ cance of the shades of principle that were revealed in the course of the struggle.
But now that the ardour of battle has subsided and the minutes remain as the objective extract of a succession of heated battles, only those who shut their eyes can fail to see that die alliance of the Makhovs and Egorovs with the Akimovs and Liebers was not, and could not be, accidental.
The only thing Martov and Axelrod can do is to avoid making an all-round and precise analysis of the minutes, or to try to undo their be­ haviour at the Congress by all sorts of expressions of regret As if regrets can remove differences of views or differences of pol­ icy! As if the present alliance of Martov and Axelrod with Akimov, Brooker and Martynov can compel our Party, which was restored at the Second Congress, to forget the struggle the Iskra-iste waged against the anti-/sAra-ists practically the whole time the Congress sat! The third type of division at the Congress, corresponding to the three remaining parts of the diagram (C, D and E), is char-.
acterised by the fact that a small section of the “Iskra"-ists broke away and tvent over to the anti-“ Iskra99-ists, which gave the latter (as long as they remained at the Congress) a majority.
In order that we may, with complete accuracy, trace the development of this celebrated coalition of the AsAra-ist minority with the anti-AsAra-ists, the bare mention of which at the Congress drove Mar­ tov to writing hysterical epistles, we have reproduced all the three main types of division by roll call.
C is the division on the question of the equal status of languages (the last of the three divisions by roll call on this issue is reproduced, as being the most complete).
All the anli-Zs/cro-ists and the whole centre stood solid against us, wliile the seceding Iskra-ists included a section of the majority and a section of the minority.
It had not yet become clear which of the “lskra”-ists were capable of form­ ing a definite and stable coalition with the opportunist “Right wing9 of the Congress.
Next comes type D division, the divi­ sion on point 1 of the rules (the division here reproduced is that one of the two divisions which was more clear cut, there being no abstentions).
The coalition becomes more distinct and more consolidated1: all the Iskra-ists of the minority are now on the side of Akimov and Lieber, but only a very small number of Iskra-iste of the majority, the latter counterbalancing the ad­ herence to our side of three delegates of the “centre” and one anti-Iskra-ist.
A glance at tire diagram will show which elements shifted accidentally and temporarily from side to side and which were drawn with irresistible force towards a lasting co­ alition with Akimov.
The last division (E—elections to the C.
O.
, the C.
C.
and the Council of the Party), which presents the final division into a majority and a minority, clearly shows the complete fusion of the Iskra-ist minority with the whole of the “centre” and with the remnants of the anti-/sfcra-ists.
By this time, of the eight anti-/sA:ra-ists Comrade Brooker alone re-1 Everything points to the fact that four of the divisions on the rules were of the same type: (p.

279 ) 26 for Martov, against 24 for us; (p.
280) 27 against myself, 22 for Martov and, on the same page, 24 for Martov, against 23 for us.
These are the divisions, already dealt with, on the question of co-optation to the centres.
The divisions were not by roll call (one was, but the record of it has been lost).
The Bundists (all or some) apparently came to the rescue of Martov.

mained at the Congress (Comrade Akimov explained his mistake to him and he took his proper place in the Martovist ranks).
The withdrawal of the seven most “Right” opportunists decided the issue of the elections against Martov.
1 And now with the aid of the objective evidence of divisions of every type, let us sum up the (results of the Congress.
There has been much talk about the “accidental” character of the majority at our Congress.
The diagram clearly shows that in a certain sense, but only in that sense, the majority may be called accidental, viz.
, in the sense that the withdrawal of the seven most opportunist delegates of the “Right wing9 was acci­ dental.
To the extent that this withdrawal was accidental, to that extent (but no more) our majority was also accidental.
A glance at the diagram will show better than long arguments on whose side those seven would have been and ought to have been* But the question must be asked: how far was the withdrawal of these seven accidental? This is the question that those who talk freely about the accidental character of the majority do not like to ask themselves.
Certainly, the question is a very unpleasant one for them.
Was it an accident that the most ardent repre­ sentatives of the Right wing and not the Left wing of our Party withdrew? Was it an accident that the opportunists withdrew, and not the consistent revolutionary Social-Democrats? Is this “accidental” withdrawal in any way connected with the struggle against the opportunist wing which was carried on the whole time the Congress was in session, and which our diagram so strikingly illustrates? It is sufficient to ask these questions, which are unpleasant for the minority, to realise what fact all this talk about the acci­ 1 The seven opportunists who withdrew from the Second Congress were the five Bundists (the Bund withdrew from the Party after the principle of federation had been rejected by the Congress) and the two Rabocheye Dyelo delegates, Comrade Martynov and Comrade Akimov.
These latter left the Congress after the Iskra-ht League had been recognised as the only Party organisation abroad, i.
e.
, after the Rabocheye Dyelo League of Russian Social Democrats had been dissolved.
’We shall see further on that after the Congress both Comrade Aki­ mov and the Voronezh Committee, which is most akin to Akimov, ex­ pressed in so many words their sympathy with the "minority” dental character of the majority is intended to conceal.
It is the unquestionable and incontrovertible fact that the minority was composed of those members of our Party who are most in­ clined towards opportunism.
The elements that comprised the minority were those that were least steady in theory, least stable in matters of principle.
It was from the Right wing of the Party that the minority was formed.
The division into a major­ ity and a minority is the direct and inevitable continuation of that division of Social-Democracy into a revolutionary wing and opportunist wing, into a Mountain and a Gironde, which made its appearance, not yesterday, and not only in the Rus­ sian working class party, and which, no doubt, will not dis­ appear tomorrow.
This fact is of cardinal importance if we want to bring to light the causes and the stages of the disagreements.
To try to evade the fact by denying or glossing over the struggle at the Congress and the shades of principle that emerged in the course of it—is to give oneself a testimonial of complete in­ tellectual and political poverty.
In order to disprove the fact, it would have to l>e shown, in the first place, that the general picture of votes and “divisions” at our Party Congress was different from the one I have drawn; and, in the second place, it would have to be shown that it was the most consistent rev­ olutionary Social-Democrats, those who in Russia have become associated with the name of Iskra, who were in the wrong in essence on the issues on which the Congress “divided.
” Try to prove that, gentlemen! Incidentally, the fact that the minority consisted of the most opportunist, the least steady and least consistent elements in the Party provides an answer to those numerous perplexities and objections that are addressed to the majority by those who are imperfectly acquainted with the matter, or have not given it sufficient thought.
Is it not shallow, we are told, to account for the disagreements by a minor mistake of Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod? Granted, Comrade Martov’s mistake was small (and I said this even at the Congress, in the heat of the strug­ gle), but this little mistake could have caused (and has caused) a lot of harm, because delegates who had made a number of mistakes and manifested an inclination towards opportunism and unsteadiness of principle on a number of questions drew Comrade Martov over to their side.
That Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod should have shown unsteadiness was an in­ dividual and unimportant fact, but what was no longer an in­ dividual, but a Party fact, and a fact by no means unimportant, was the formation of a very considerable minority that in­ cluded all the least steady elements, all those who either en­ tirely rejected Iskras line of policy and openly opposed it, or who, while doing lip-service to it, were in practice constantly on die side of the anti-/sfcra-ists.
Is it not absurd to account for the disagreement by the fact that a hardened circle spirit and revolutionary philistinism reigned in the small group comprising the original editors of Iskra? No, it is not absurd, because all those in our Party who during the whole Congress had fought for every kind of circle spirit, all those who were incapable of rising above revolution­ ary philistinism, all those who appealed to the “historic” character of the evil of philistinism and the circle spirit in order to justify and preserve the evil—all rose in support of this individual circle spirit.
The fact that narrow circle in­ terests got the better of the Painty spirit in the one little circle of the editors of Iskra may, perhaps, be regarded as accidental; but it was not an accident that this circle spirit received the staunch support of the Akimovs and the Brookers, who attached no less (if not more) value to the “historical continuity” of the famous Voronezh Committee* and the famous “workers’ ” organisation in St.
Petersburg;1 that it received the support of the Egorovs, who were lamenting the “murder” of Rabocheye Dyelo as loudly (if not more so) as the “murder” of the old editorial board; that it received the support of the Makhovs, etc.
, etc.
The old proverb says: “Tell me who your friends are and I will tell you what you are.
” Tell me who your political ally is, who votes for you—and I will tell you what your political complexion is.
1 See note to page The minor mistake committed by Comrade Martov and Com­ rade Axelrod was, and might have remained, a minor one as long as it did not serve as the starting point for their per­ manent alliance with the whole opportunist wing of our Party, as long as it did not lead, as a result of this alliance, to a recrudescence of opportunism, to a desire for revanche on the part of all those whom Iskra had fought and who were over­ joyed at the opportunity of venting their spite on the con­ sistent adherents of revolutionary Social-Democracy.
The events after the Congress have led to an actual recrudescence of op­ portunism in the new Iskra, to the revanche of the Akimovs and Brookers (see the leaflet issued by the Voronezh Committee), to the ecstasies of the Martynovs who have at long last (at long last!) been allowed, in the hated Iskra, to kick the hated enemy for all former grievances.
This makes it particularly clear how important it was to “restore the old editorial board of Iskra' (quoted from Comrade Starover’s ultimatum of November 16 [3], 1903) in order to preserve Iskra-ist “continuity.
.
.
Taken by itself, there was nothing alarming and nothing critical, not even anything abnormal, in the fact that the Con­ gress (and the Party) divided into a Left and a Right, into a revolutionary wing and an opportunist wing.
On tlie con­ trary, the preceding ten years in the history of Russian (and not only of Russian) Social-Democracy had been inevitably and inescapably leading up to such a division.
The fact that it was a number of very minor errors of the Right wing, of very unimportant (relatively) dissensions that caused the division (which seems shocking to the superficial observer and to the philistine mind), marked a great step forward for our Party as a whole.
Formerly we had dissensions on major issues which were at times sufficient to justify a split; now we have agreed on all major and important points, and we are only divided by shades of opinion, about which we may and must argue, but on which it would be absurd and puerile to part company (as Comrade Plekhanov has quite rightly said in his interest­ ing article “What Should Not Be Done?”* which we shall have to return to).
Now that the anarchistic behaviour of the minor­ ity after the Congress has nearly led to a split in the Party, we often hear wiseacres saying: was it worth fighting at the Con­ gress over such petty things as the O.
C.
incident, the dissolu­ tion of the Yuzhny Rabochy group, over Rabocheye Dyelo, point 1, the dissolution of the old editorial board, etc.
? Those who reason in this way introduce the circle point of view in Party affairs: the struggle between shades of opinion inside the Party is unavoidable and necessary as long as it does not lead to anarchy and to a split, as long as it is carried on within the bounds approved by the common consent of all comrades and Parly members.
Our struggle against the Right wing of the Party at the Congress, against Akimov and Axelrod, against Martynov and Martov, never passed beyond these bounds.
It is sufficient to recall two facts which testify to this in the most incontrovertible way: 1) when Martynov and Akimov were about to leave the Congress we were all prepared to do every­ thing to disclaim all idea of wanting to “insult” anyone, we were all ready to accept (thirty-two votes) the resolution pro­ posed by Comrade Trotsky, which invited these comrades to accept these explanations as satisfactory and to withdraw their statement; 2) when it came to the election of the centres, we were ready to give the minority (or the opportunist wing) of the Congress a minority in both the centres: to Martov on the C.
O.
, to Popov on the C.
C.
We were unable to act otherwise from the Party point of view, since we had decided before the Con­ gress to elect two groups of three.
The difference in the shades of opinion that was manifested at the Congress was not great, but neither was the practical conclusion which we drew from the struggle between these two shades of opinion: the con­ clusion amounted to this, and no more than this, that the major­ ity of the Party Congress should be given two-thirds of the seats in both centres.
It was only the refusal of the minority at the Party Congress to be a minority in the centres that led first to the “sloppy whimpering” of the defeated intellectuals, and after that to anarchist phrases and anarchist action.
In conclusion, we shall glance once again at the diagram from the point of view of the constitution of the centres.
Natur­ ally, during the elections, in addition to the question of shades of opinion, the delegates were also faced with the question of the suitability, efficiency, etc.
, of a given person.
Now die minority is very fond of confusing these questions.
That these are two different questions is self-evident and may be seen, for instance, from the simple fact that the choice of the original group of three for the C.
O.
had been made before the Con­ gress, at a time when no one could have foreseen the alliance of Martov and Axelrod with Martynov and Akimov.
Different questions have to be answered in different ways: the answer to the question of shades of opinion must be sought for in the min­ utes of the Congress, in the open discussion and the divisions on all the various issues.
As to the question of the suitability of persons it was decided to settle it at the Congress by secret ballot.
Why did the Congress unanimously take that decision? 'The question is so elementary that it wTould be odd to dwell on it.
But since their defeat at the ballot box, the minority have been forgetting even their ABC.
We have heard torrents of ardent, passionate speeches, heated almost to the point of ir­ responsibility, in defence of the old editorial board, but we have heard absolutely nothing about the shades of opinion at the Congress, wrhich are connected with the struggle for a group of six or a group of three.
We have heard talk and stories from every corner about the inefficiency, the unsuitabil­ ity, the evil intentions, etc.
, of the persons elected to the C.
C.
, but wre have heard absolutely nothing about the shades of opinion which fought for the control of the C.
C.
at the Con­ gress.
I think it is indecent and unworthy to go about talking and telling stories outside the Congress about the qualities and the actions of individuals (because in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred these actions are an organisational secret, which can only be disclosed to the supreme institution of the Party).
I am convinced that carrying on the fight outside the Congress by means of stories like these would mean behaving like scandal-mongers.
And the only public reply I could make to all this talk would be to refer them to the struggle at the Con­ gress: you say that the C.
C.
was elected by a narrow majority.
That is true.
But this narrow majority consisted of all those who really fought for the fulfilment of the Iskra plans most consistently.
Consequently, the moral prestige of a majority like that must be incomparably higher than its formal pres­ tige—higher in the eyes of all those who value the continuity of Iskras line of policy above the continuity of any Iskra circle.
Who was most competent to fudge the suitability of a given person for carrying out the Iskra policy? Was it those who supported that policy at the Congress, or those who in a number of cases opposed that policy and defended everything that was obsolete, every kind of rubbish, every kind of circle spirit?1 q.
The New “Iskra” Opportunism in Questions of Organization In analysing the position of principle taken up by the new Iskra we must unquestionably take as our basis the two feuil-letons of Comrade Axelrod.
We have already shown in detail the concrete meaning of some of his favourite catchwords2; we must now try to abstract ourselves from this concrete meaning, look a little more closely at the line of thought that forced the “minority” (on every minor and petty occasion) to arrive at precisely these rather than at any other slogans, and to con­ sider the essential meaning of these slogans apart from their genesis, apart from the question of “co-optation.
” Compliancy is the fashion today, so let us comply with Comrade Axelrod and take his theory seriously.
Comrade Axelrods main contention (Iskra, No.
57) is that “from the very outset our movement harboured two opposite tendencies the mutual antagonism of which could not fail to grow and to affect the movement parallel with the latter’s own development.
” Namely: “the proletarian object of the move-1 Sections o and P are omitted in this edition.

—Ed.
meat (in Russia) is the same in principle as that of Western Social-Democracy*’; but in our country the masses of the work­ ers are influenced “by a social element alien to them”—the radical intelligentsia.
So Comrade Axelrod establishes an an­ tagonism between the proletarian and the radical-intellectual trends in our Party.
In this Comrade Axelrod is quite right.
This antagonism certainly exists (and not in the Russian Social-Democratic Party alone).
Moreover, everyone knows that it is very largely this antagonism that accounts for the division of contemporary Russian Social-Democracy into a revolutionary (orthodox) and an opportunist (revisionist, ministerialist, reformist) wing, which has become fully apparent even in Russia during the past ten years of our movement.
Everyone knows also that it is the proletarian trend of the movement that is expressed by orthodox Social-Democracy and that the democratic-intellec­ tual trend is expressed by opportunist Social-Democracy.
But when he comes quite close to this piece of common knowledge, Comrade Axelrod shies and begins to back away from it.
He does not make the slightest attempt to analyse the way in which this division has manifested itself in the history of Russian Social-Democracy, and more particularly al our Con­ gress, although it is about the Congress that Comrade Axelrod is writing! Like all the editors of the new Iskra, Comrade Axelrod displays mortal fear of the minutes of this Congress.
After all we have said, this need not astonish us, but in a “theoretician” who pretends to be investigating the different trends in our movement it is certainly a queer case of truth shyness.
And because of this, pushing aside very up-to-date and very accurate material on the trends in our movement, Com­ rade Axelrod seeks salvation in the sphere of pleasant phantas­ ies.
He writes: “Did not legal or semi-Marxism provide our liberals with a literary leader?1 Why should not history in her frolics provide revolutionary bourgeois-democracy with a leader from the school of orthodox, revolutionary Marxism?” All we can say about this phantasy, which Comrade Axelrod finds 1 /.

so pleasant, is that if history is occasionally frolicsome, it does not justify mental frolics on the part of those who undertake to analyse history.
When die liberal peeped from under the cloak of the leader of semi-Marxism, those who wished (and were able) to trace his “trends” did not invoke the possible frolics of history, but tens and hundreds of instances of the mentality and of the logic of that leader and the peculiarities of his literary complexion which revealed him to be nothing more than a reflection of Marxism in bourgeois literature.
And if after having undertaken to analyse “the general revolution­ ary and proletarian trends in our movement” Comrade Axel­ rod was unable to produce a single argument, not the tiniest bit of an argument or shred of evidence, to prove the presence of certain trends among certain representatives of the orthodox wing of the Party whom he detests so much, it only shows that he has given himself a formal testimonial of poverty.
Comrade Axelrod’s case must, indeed, be a bad one, if he is reduced to invoking the possible frolics of history.
Comrade Axelrod’s other allusion—to the “Jaoobins”—is still more instructive.
Comrade Axelrod is probably aware that the division of modern Social-Democracy into a revolutionary wing and an opportunist wing has long been the occasion—and not in Russia alone—for “historical analogies drawn from the age of the Great French Revolution.
” Comrade Axelrod is probably aware that everywhere the Girondists of contemporary Social-Democracy have alw’ays used such terms as Jacobinism and Blanquism to describe their opponents.
We shall not imitate Comrade Axelrod’s truth shyness; wre shall refer to the min­ utes of our Congress to see whether they contain any material for analysing and testing the trends we are discussing and the analogies we are considering.
First example.
Debate on the programme at the Party Con­ gress.
Comrade Akimov (“fully endorsing” Comrade Marty­ nov) made the statement: “the clause concerning the capture of political power [the dictatorship of the proletariat] has been formulated in such a way that, if compared with the programmes of all the other Social-Democratic Parties, it may be interpreted, and has been interpreted by Plekhanov, as meaning that the role of the leaders of the organisation will relegate the class they are leading to the background and separate the former from the latter.
Consequently, we have formulated our political tasks in exactly the same way as was done by Narodnaya Volya.
" (Minutes, p.
124.
) Comrade Plekh­ anov and other /sAra-ists reply to Comrade Akimov, and accuse him of opportunism.
Does not Comrade Axelrod think that this debate shows us (by actual facts, and not by the imagin­ ary frolics of history) the antagonism between the modern Jacobins and Girondists in Social-Democracy? And did not Comrade Axelrod begin talking about Jacobins because (owing to the mistakes he committed) he found himself in the com­ pany of the Girondists of Social-Democracy? Second example.
Comrade Posadovsky raises the point that there is a “grave difference” on the “fundamental issue” of “the absolute value of democratic principles.
” (P.
169.
) To­ gether with Plekhanov he denies that their value is absolute.
The leaders of the “centre” or Marsh (Egorov) and of the anti-AsAra-ists (Goldblatt) vigorously oppose this view and discover in Plekhanov’s attitude an “imitation of bourgeois tactics.
” (P.
170.
) This is precisely Comrade Axelrod's notion of the connection between orthodoxy and bourgeois trends, the only difference being that Axelrod leaves it hanging in the air, while Goldblatt linked it up with a definite discussion.
Once again we ask the question: does not Comrade Axelrod think that this debate makes the antagonism between the Jacob­ ins and the Girondists of Social-Democracy at our Party Con­ gress obvious? Has not Comrade Axelrod raised this outcry against the Jacobins because he found himself in the company of the Girondists? Third example.
Debate on point 1 of the rules.
XJTio de­ fends “the proletarian trend in our movement"? Who empha­ sises the point that the worker is not afraid of organisation, that the proletarian has no sympathy with anarchy, that he values the watchword “organise!”? Who utters the warning against the bourgeois intelligentsia, which is permeated with opportunism? The Jacobins of Social-Democracy, And who tries to drag the radical intellectuals into the Party? Who is concerned about professors and high-school students, about lone members, about the radical youth? The Girondist Axel­ rod together with the Girondist Lieber, Comrade Axelrod does not defend himself very cleverly against the “false charge of opportunism” that was openly brought against the majority of the “Emancipation of Labour” group at the Congress.
His defence is such that he confirms the charge, by harping on the hackneyed Bemsteinian melody of Jacobinism, Blanquism and so on! He raises an outcry about the menace of the radical intelligentsia in order to deafen his own speeches at the Party Congress in which he ex­ pressed concern for that very intelligentsia.
All these “dreadful catchwords” about Jacobinism and the rest express absolutely nothing more than opportunism, A Jacobin who is inseparably linked with the organisation of the proletariat which is conscious of its class interests, is a rev­ olutionary Social-Democrat.
A Girondist, longing for profess­ ors and high-school boys, afraid of the dictatorship of the pro­ letariat and sighing about the absolute value of democratic de­ mands, is an opportunist.
It is only opportunists who can still be of the opinion that conspirative organisations are a danger at a time when the idea of narrowing the political fight down to a conspiracy has been refuted thousands of times in litera­ ture, has been refuted and crowded out by life, when the cardinal importance of mass political agitation has been made clear and chewed over to the point of nausea.
The real source of tins fear of conspiracy, of Blanquism, is not to be found in any feature that may have revealed itself in the practical move­ ment (as Bernstein and Co.
have long and vainly been trying to show), but in the Girondist timidity of the bourgeois intellectual whose mentality is so often revealed among the Social-Democrats of today.
Nothing can be more comical than these efforts of the new Iskra to utter a new word (that has been uttered hundreds of times) of warning against the tactics of the French revolutionary conspirators of the ’forties and ’six­ 26 Leuui 11 ties.
* (No.
62, leading article.
) In the next number of Iskra, the Girondists of contemporary So ci al-Democracy will prob­ ably point out to us a group of French conspirators of the ’forties for whom the importance of political agitation among the working masses, the importance of the workers’ press, as the principal means by which the Party influences the class, was an A B C that had long ago been learned and forgotten.
However, the tendency of the new Iskra to repeat things by rote and to chew the ABC over and over again, while pre­ tending to be uttering new words, is by no means accidental; it is the inevitable consequence of the position to which Axel­ rod and Martov have sunk now that they have dropped into the opportunist wing of our Party.
Noblesse oblige! They have to go on repeating opportunist phrases, they have to crawl back­ wards so as to be able to find, in the distant past, some justi­ fication for (heir position, which is indefensible from the point of view of the struggle at the Congress or of the shades and divisions in the Party that emerged after the Congress.
To the profound Akimovist remarks about Jacobinism and Blanquism Comrade Axelrod adds Akim ovist lamentations to the effect that not only the “Economists,” but also the “politicians” were “one-sided,” “went too far,” and so on and so forth.
Reading the high-flown disquisitions on this subject in the new Iskra, which boastingly claims to be above one-sidedness and ex­ aggeration, one asks oneself in perplexity: whose portrait are they painting? Where do they hear this talk? Who does not know that the division of Russian Social-Democrats into Econ­ omists and politicians became obsolete long ago? Go through the files of Iskra for the last year or two before the Party Congress and you will find that the fight against “Economism” was subsiding and finally came to an end as far back as 1902; you will find that, for example, in July 1903 (No.
43), the “times of Economism” are considered to have “completely passed away.
” Economism is considered to be “dead and buried,” and the enthusiasm of the politicians is regarded as an obvious ata­ vism.
Why, then, should the new editors of Iskra wish to revive a division that is dead and buried? Do you think that our fight with the Akimovs at the Congress was about the old mistakes they committed two years ago in Rabocheye Dyclo? Had we behaved in that way we would have been hopeless idiots.
But everyone knows that we did not do so, that it was not for their old, dead and buried mistakes in Rabocheye Dyelo that we fought the Akimovs at the Congress, but for the new mis­ takes which they committed in their arguments and in the vot­ ing at the Congress.
It was not by their position on Rabocheye Dyelo, but by their position at the Congress that we judged which mistakes had been in effect abandoned and which were still alive and called for controversy.
At the time of the Con­ gress the old division into Economists and politicians no longer existed; but numerous opportunist trends continued to exist.
They found expression in the debates and voting on a number of issues, and finally led to a new division of the Party into a ‘‘majority” and a “minority.
” The whole point is that the new editors of Iskra are for obvious reasons trying to gloss over the connection that exists between this new division and contemporary opportunism in our Party, and that they are, con­ sequently, compelled to back away from the new division to the old one.
Their inability to explain the political genesis of the new division (or the desire, in order to show themselves accommodating, to cast a veil1 over its genesis) compels them to go on chewing the cud about a division that has been ob­ solete for a long time.
Everyone knows that the starting point of the new division is the difference of opinion on questions of organisation which began with the controversy over principles of 1 See Plekhanov’s article “Economisin’* in No.
53 of Iskra.
The sub­ title of the article appears to contain a misprint.
For Thoughts Aloud on the Second Parly Congress one should evidently read On the Congress of the League, or perhaps On Co optation.
While, under certain circumstances, a spirit of accommodation on questions of personal grievances is com­ mendable, it is quite inadmissible (from the Party as distinct from the philistine point of view) to confuse the issues that agitate the Party, to substitute for the question of the new mistake of Martov and Axelrod who have begun to veer round from orthodoxy to opportunism, the question of the old mistake (never recalled today by anyone outside the new Iskra) of the Martynovs and the Akimovs, who today may be on the point of turning from opportunism to orthodoxy on a number of questions of pro­ gramme and tactics.
23* organisation (point 1 of the rules) and led to a “practice*1 worthy of anarchists.
The old division into Economists and pol­ iticians was based mainly on a difference of opinion on ques­ tions of tactics.
i • The new Iskra tries to justify this attempt to retreat from the complex, really actual and burning Party issues to issues that have long been settled and have to be artificially dug up, by an amusing display of profound wisdom which cannot be described otherwise than as khvostism.
Thanks to the facile hand of Comrade Axelrod, the profound “idea” that content is more important than form, that the programme and tactics are more important than organisation, that “the vitality of an organisation is in direct proportion to the volume and im­ portance of the content it gives to the movement,” that central­ ism is not “something self-sufficing,” is not an “all-saving talis­ man,” etc.
, etc.
, runs like a thread through the writings of the new Iskra.
Profound and great verities! A programme is in­ deed more important than tactics, and tactics more important than organisation.
The alphabet is more important than etymolo­ gy, etymology is more important than syntax—but what would we think of those who, after having failed in an examination on syntax, would go about pluming themselves on having been left in the lower form for another year? Comrade Axel­ rod has spoken like an opportunist on fundamental questions of organisation (point 1), and has behaved like an anarchist inside the organisation (Congress of the League)—and now he is trying to make the principles of Social-Democracy more profound: sour grapes! What is organisation? It is merely a form.
What is centralism? It is not a talisman.
What is syn­ tax? It is less important than grammar; it is merely a form of combining the elements of grammar.
The new editors of Iskra write triumphantly: “Will not Comrade Alexandrov agree with us when we say that the Congress did much more for the centralisation of Party work by drawing up a Party programme than by passing the rules, however perfect the latter may seem?”* (No.
56, appendix.
) We hope this classical aphorism will acquire the widest fame, no less last­ ing than Comrade Krichevsky’s phrase that, like mankind, Social-Democracy always sets itself accomplishable tasks.
The wisdom of the new Iskra is of exactly the same alloy.
Why was Comrade Krichevsky’s phrase held up to derision? Because he tried to justify the mistake of a section of the Social-Dem­ ocrats on a tactical question, their inability correctly to form­ ulate political aims, by a commonplace which he tried to palm off as philosophy.
In exactly the same way the new Iskra tries to justify the mistake of a section of the Social-Democrats on questions of organisation, to justify the intelligentsia-like in­ stability of certain comrades—which led them to utter anarchist phrases—by the commonplace that the programme is more im­ portant than the rules and that questions of programme are more important than questions of organisation! Well, is this not khvostism? Is this not pluming oneself on having been left in the lower form for another year? The adoption of a programme contributes more to the cen­ tralisation of the Party than the passing of the rules.
How this commonplace, palmed off as philosophy, smacks of the mental­ ity of a radical intellectual, a mentality that is more akin to bourgeois decadence than to Social-Democracy! For is not the word centralisation in this famous phrase given a meaning that can only be described as symbolical? If the authors of this phrase are unable or disinclined to think, they might at least have recalled the simple fact that though the Bundists voted with us in favour of the programme, this did not result in the centralisation of our common work, and did not even save us from a split.
Unity on questions of programme and tactics is the necessary but far from adequate condition for Party unity and for centralised Party work (Good God! The sort of ABC one has to chew the cud over nowadays, when all notions have become confused!).
The latter demands, in addition, a unity of organisation which, in a Party that has grown to be more than a mere family circle, is inconceivable unless there are formal rules, unless die minority submits to the majority, unless the part submits to the whole.
As long as we lacked unity on the essential questions of programme and tactics we simply admitted that we were living in a time of dispersion and of circle spirit, we said that we must first separate and then unite; we never raised the question of the forms a united organisation might assume; we only talked of the new questions (at that time they ireally were new) of fighting opportunism on questions of programme and tactics.
This fight, as everyone admits, resulted in securing for us a sufficient de­ gree of unity, which was formulated in the Party programme and in the Party’s resolutions on tactics; we then had to take the next step and, by common consent, we took it; for we elaborated the forms of a united organisation that would unite all the groups into one whole.
But now these forms have been half broken, we have been dragged back, dragged back to anarchist action, to phrases, to the revival of a circle in place of the Party editorial board; and this step back is now being justified by the argument that tlie alphabet is more important for literate speech than a knowledge of syntax.
The philosophy of khvostism, which flourished three years ago on questions of tactics, is being revived today on ques­ tions of organisation.
Take, for instance, this argument of the new editors: “‘A militant Social-Democratic line in the Par­ ty’—writes Comrade Alexandrov—‘must not only be enforced by means of an ideological struggle, but by definite organisa­ tional forms.
”’ And the editors go on to lecture us: “Not bad, this juxtaposition of ideological struggle and forms of organ­ isation.
The ideological struggle is a process, but the forms of organisation are just.
.
.
forms” (tins is literally what is printed in No.
56, supplement, p.
4, col.
I, bottom of the page), “the purpose of which is to clothe the fluid, developing content—the developing practical work of the Party.
” This is quite in the spirit of the famous anecdote about a shell being a shell, and a bomb a bomb! The ideological struggle is a process, and the forms of ’organisation are only forms clothing the content! The issue is whether our ideological struggle wdll have forms of a higher type to clothe them, forms of a Party organisation obligatory for all, or the forms of the former dis­ persion and the former circles.
We have been dragged back from the higher to the more primitive forms, and this is being justified by the argument that the ideological struggle is a process and forms are merely forms.
Exactly like Comrade Krichevsky when, once upon a time, he tried to drag us back from the concept of the tactics-plan to the concept of the tac­ tics-process.
Take the pretentious phrases of the new Iskra about the “self-training of the proletariat” that are hurled against those who, it is alleged, are capable of missing the content because of the form.
(No.

*) Is this not a second edition of Akimovism? Akimovism, number one, tried tc jus­ tify the backwardness of a section of the Social-Democratic in­ telligentsia in formulating tactical tasks by talking about the more “profound” content of the “proletarian struggle” anti about the self-training of the proletariat.
Akimovism, number two, tries to justify the backwardness in the theory and prac­ tice of organisation of a section of the Social-Democratic in­ telligentsia by similar profound talk about organisation being merely a form, and the whole point being the self-training of the proletariat.
Let me tell you gentlemen, who are so solicit­ ous about the younger brother,1 that the proletariat is not afraid of organisation and discipline! The proletariat will not worry about professors and high-school students, who do not want to join an organisation, being recognised as Party mem­ bers merely because they work under the control of an organ­ isation.
The proletariat is trained for organisation by its whole life much more radically than are many puny intellectuals.
A proletariat which has understood our programme and our tactics to any extent will not try to justify backwardness in mat­ ters of organisation by talk about form being less important than content.
It is not the proletariat, but certain intellectuals in our Party who lack self-training in the spirit of organisation and discipline, in the spirit of hostility and contempt for anarchist phrase-mongering.
The Akimovs, number two, libel 1 “The younger brother,” a phrase used in the ’sixties by sentimental liberals to describe the lower classes, Later it was used chiefly in irony.

the proletariat when they say that it is not ripe for organ­ isation, just as the Akimovs, number one, did when they said it was not ripe for the political struggle.
The proletarian who has became a class conscious Social-Democrat and feels that he is a member of the Party will reject khvostism in matters of organisation with the same contempt as he rejected khvost­ ism in matters of tactics.
Finally, take the profound wisdom of “Practical Worker” in the new Iskra, “If it is understood in the proper way,” he says, “the idea of a centralised ‘fighting’ organisation which unites and centralises the activities*9 (the italics are to make it look more profound) “of revolutionaries can naturally materi­ alise only if such activities exist” (very fresh and clever); “the organisation itself, being a form” (hear! hear!), “can only grow simultaneously" (the italics are the author’s, as through­ out this quotation) “with the growth of revolutionary work which is the content.
” (No.
57.
) Does this not remind you once again of the hero of the popular story who, when he saw a funeral, cried out to the coffin bearers: “Many happy re­ turns of the day”? I am sure there is not a practical worker (without quotation marks) in the whole of our Party who does not understand that it is precisely the form of our activities (i.
e.
, our organisation) that for many years has been lagging and lagging very badly behind the content, and that to shout to these laggards: “Keep in step!” “Don’t run ahead!” is some-thing worthy only of the Ivanushkas1 in our Party.
Compare our Party with, say, the Bund.
There can be no question that the content2 of our work is incomparably richer, more many-sided, wider and deeper than the Bund’s.
The scope of our the­ oretical views is wider, our programme is more developed, our influence among the working masses (and not among the 1 Ivanushka the Fool is a character in Russian folk tales who always does and says the wrong tiling, for example, shouting, “Many happy re­ turns of the day,” on seeing a funeral.

21 leave aside the fact that the content of our Party work was in­ dicated (in the programme, etc.
) at the Congress in the spirit of rev­ olutionary Social-Democracy’ only ns a result of a fight against the very onti-/sAra-ists and the very “Marsh” the representatives of which pre­ dominate numerically in the “minority/’ organised artisans alone) is wider and deeper, our propaganda and agitation are more varied, the pulse of the political work of the leaders and of rank and filers beats faster, die popular movements during demonstrations and general strikes are grand­ er, our work among the non-proletarian population is more energetic.
But the “form”? Compared with that of the Bund the “form” of our work lags behind disgracefully; the lag is so great that it is glaring and brings the blush of shame to the cheeks of everyone who does not merely stand about ‘‘pick­ ing his nose,” and contemplating the work of his Party.
The fact that the organisation of our work lags behind its content is our sore spot, and it was a sore spot long before the Con­ gress, long before the formation of the O.
C.
The undeveloped and unstable character of the form makes any further serious step in the development of the content impossible; it causes shameful stagnation, waste of strength and discrepancy be­ tween word and deed.
Everyone is sick and tired of this dis­ crepancy—and now the Axelrods and the “Practical Workers” of the new Iskra come along with their profound sermons and say: form must grow naturally and only simultaneously with the content! This is where a small mistake on a question of organisation (point 1) is apt to bring you, if you try to add profundity to a piece of rubbish and to find philosophical grounds for an opportunist phrase.
With slow steps, in timid zigzags!—We heard this tune when the issue was a question of tactics; we hear it once again applied to questions of organisation.
Khvosl-• ism in questions of organisation is (the natural and inevitable outgrowth of the mentality of an anarchist individualist when he tries to elevate his anarchist vacillations (which at the out­ set may have been accidental) to a system of views, to a differ­ ence of principle.
At the Congress of the League we witnessed the beginnings of this sort of anarchism; in the new Iskra we see attempts to elevate it to a system of views.
These attempts strikingly confirm what was said at the Party Congress about die difference between die point of view of a bourgeois intel­ lectual who joins the Social-Democrat«; and a proletarian who has become conscious of his class interests.
For instance, “Practical Worker” who wrote to the new Iskra, and whose profundity we have become familiar with, denounces me for vis­ ualising the Party as “an immense factory” with a director in the shape of the C.
C.
at its head.
(No.
57, supplement.
) “Practical Worker” does not realise that the frightful word he utters im­ mediately betrays the mentality of a bourgeois intellectual who is familiar with neither the practice nor the theory of pro­ letarian organisation.
For it is precisely the factory, v'hich some seem to regard as a bogey, that is the highest form of capitalist co-operation which has brought together and disci­ plined the proletariat, taught it to organise and placed it at the head of all other sections of the toiling and exploited population.
It is precisely Marxism, as the ideology of the proletariat trained by capitalism, that has been teaching unstable intellectuals to distinguish between the factory as an instrument of exploita­ tion (discipline based on the fear of starvation) and as a fac­ tor in organisation (discipline based on collective work, united under conditions of technically highly developed production).
The discipline and organisation, which it is so difficult for the bourgeois intellectual to acquire, are easily acquired by the proletarian precisely because of the factory “school” he goes through.
Mortal fear of this school and complete inability to understand its importance as an organising force are character­ istic of ways of thinking which reflect a petty-bourgeois mode of life and which give rise to that anarchism which the Ger­ man Social-Democrats have called Edelanarchismus, i.
e.
, the anarchism of a “noble” gentleman, or gentleman’s anarchism, as I would call it.
The Russian nihilist is pairticularly suscept­ ible to this kind of gentleman’s anarchism.
He thinks of the Party organisation as a monstrous “factory” and of the sub­ ordination of the part to the whole and of the minority to the majority as “serfdom” (see Axelrod’s feuilleton); division of labour under the leadership of a centre evokes from him tragi­ comical cries about people being turned into “wheels and screws” (the most outrageous form of this transformation is considered to be the conversion of an editor into a contrih-utor); mention of the organisational rules of the Party calls forth a contemptuous grimace and the disdainful remark (in­ tended for the “formalists”) that one can very well dispense with rules altogether.
It sounds improbable, but it is a fact; this is precisely the sort of didactic remark Comrade Martov addressed to me in No.
58 of Iskra, quoting, the better to convince me, my own words from “A Letter to a Comrade.
”* Well, is it not “gentle­ man’s anarchism,” is it not khvostism, when people begin justi­ fying the preservation and glorification of the circle spirit and anarchy in the Party epoch by instances taken from the epoch of dispersion, the epoch of circles? Why could we dispense with rules before? Because the Party consisted of isolated circles, unconnected by any organ­ isational link.
To pass from one circle to another was merely a matter of the “free will” of the individual who was not faced with the will of the whole in any definite form.
Con­ troversial questions inside the circles were not settled in ac­ cordance with the rules, “but by fighting it out and by a threat to leave"; these were the words which I used in “A Letter to a Comrade,” basing myself on the experience of a number of circles and of our editorial circle of six in particular.
In the circle epoch, these things wore natural and inevitable, but it never entered anyone’s head to extol them or to regard them as ideal; everyone complained of this dispersion of forces, every­ one felt it to be a burden and longed for the time when all the isolated circles would coalesce into a formal Party organ­ isation.
And now that they have coalesced, we are being dragged back, and under the cloak of higher organisational ideas we are being served with anarchist phrases! To those who have grown accustomed to loose Oblomov1 dressing gowns and slippers of the family circle period, formal rules seem narrow, and strait, and burdensome, and low, and bureaucratic, and servile, and a deterrent to the free “process” of the ideological struggle.
1 Oblomov, the principal character in a novel by Goncharov (1858), is a type of supine, well-intentioned and absolutely useless member of the nobility.
—Ed.
Eng.
ed, Gentleman’s anarchism is unable to understand that formal rules are needed precisely to make the substitution of the wide Party link for the narrow circle link possible.
There was no need, and it was impassible, to establish formal links in­ side the circle or between the circles, because the circles were kept together by personal friendships and a confidence which had not to be accounted for and for which no reasons had to be given.
The Party link cannot and must not rest on either the one or the other; it must be founded on formal, “bureaucrati­ cally” (from «the point of view of the undisciplined intellectual) worded rules, strict adherence to which alone can safeguard us from the wilfulness and the caprices of the circle spirit, from the circle scramble methods that go by the name of “process of the ideological struggle.
” As their trump card against Alexandrov the editors of the new Iskra use the didactic remark that “confidence is a delicate matter which cannot be knocked into our hearts and heads.
” (No.
56.
supplement.
) The editors fail to realise that by ad­ vancing the category of confidence, of mere confidence, they once again betray their gentleman’s anarchism and their organ­ isational khvostism.
As long as I was merely a member of a circle—whether it was the editorial circle of six, or the Iskra organisation, I was entitled to justify my refusal, say, to work with X merely by expressing a lack of confidence in him, without having to account or give any reason for it.
Now that I have become a member of a party I am no longer entitled merely to invoke an informal lack of confidence, because this would throw the doors open to every freak and every whim in the old circle spirit; I must support my “confidence” or “lack of confidence” by formal reasons, i.
e.
, by invoking a formally established point of our programme, of our tactics ot of our rules.
I must not confine myself «to an unaccounted-for “con­ fidence” or “no confidence,” but must realise that all my de­ cisions and all the decisions of any section of the Parly must be accounted for before the whole Party; in giving expression to my “lack of confidence,” and in trying to get the views and wishes that result from that lack of confidence accepted, I must adheie to a formally prescribed procedure.
We have risen from the circle point of view of unaccounted-for “confidence,” to the Party point of view which demands adherence to account­ able and formally prescribed means of expressing and testing our confidence; but the editors are trying to drag us back, and are calling their khvostism new organisational views.
Listen to the way our so-oalled Party editors talk of the literary groups that might claim to be represented on the editorial board.
The gentlemen anarchists who have always looked down on that thing called discipline say to us didactic­ ally: “We shall not get angry or raise an outcry about dis­ cipline.
” We shall either “corne to an understanding” (sic!) with the group, if it is reasonable, or just hold up its pre­ tensions to ridicule.
Dear, dear, with what lofty nobility they attack our vulgar “factory” formalism! But in reality it is the old circle phrase­ ology that is being served up by an editorial board which feels that it is not a Party body, but merely the remnant of an old circle.
The inner falsity of the position inevitably leads to an-archist profundity, which tries to elevate the dispersion, which in words they pharisaically admit to be obsolete, to a principle of Social-Democratic organisation.
There is no need for a hierarchy of higher and lower Party bodies—gentleman’s anarchism re­ gards such a hierarchy as the bureaucratic invention of ministries, departments, etc.
(see Axelrod’s feuilleton); there is no need for the part to submit to the whole, nor for the “formal bur­ eaucratic” definition of Party methods of “coming to an agree­ ment,” or agreeing to divide; let die old circle scramble method be sanctified by phrases about “genuinely Social-Democratic” principles of organisation.
This is where the proletarian who has been through the school of the “factory” can and must teach anarchist individualism a lesson.
The class conscious worker emerged from these swad­ dling clothes long ago when he fought shy of the intellectual as such.
The class conscious worker knows how to prize the rich store of knowledge and the wider political horizon which he finds in Social-Democratic intellectuals.
But to the extent that a real party is formed, the class conscious worker must learn to distinguish the mentality of the soldier of the proletarian army from the mentality of the bourgeois intellectual who flaunts an­ archist phrases; he must learn to insist that the duties of a Party member be fulfilled not only by the rank and filers, but by the “people at the top” as well, he must learn to treat khvostism in matters of organisation with the contempt with which he in the old days used to treat khvostism in tactical matters! There is one more characteristic feature of the new Iskras position in matters of organisation, which is inseparably con­ nected with its Girondism and its gentleman’s anarchism: this is the defence of autonomism sls against centralism.
This is the general meaning (if any)1 that can be attached to this outcry about bureaucracy and autocracy, to these regrets about “unde­ served neglect of the non-ZsZcra-ists” (who defended autonom-iism at the Congress), to these comic cries about our insisting on “unqualified obedience,” to these bitter complaints about “Pompadours,”2 etc.
, etc.
The opportunist wing of any party will always defend and try to justify all lagging behind, whether in the programme, in tactics or in matters of organisation.
Ilie defence of backwardness in matters of organisation (khvostism) is closely connected with the defence of autonom­ ism, It is true that, speaking generally, autonomism has been so discredited by the three years of propaganda carried on by the old Iskra that the new Iskra is ashamed, as yet, to advo­ cate it openly; it still tries to convince us of its sympathies for “centralism”; but the only proof of these sympathies is that the word “centralism” is always italicised.
In actual fact, it is enough to apply the slightest touch of criticism to the “genuinely Social-Democratic” (and not anarchistic?) quasi-oentralism of the new Iskra for the autonomist standpoint to reveal itself at every step.
Has it not become clear to everyone that on questions of organisation Axelrod and Martov have veered back to Akimov? Did they not solemnly admit it them-XI entirely disregard here, as elsewhere in this section, the “co-opt a-tional” meaning of these words.

selves in those significant words about “the undeserved neglect of the non-/s&ra-ists” ? And was it not autonomism that Aki­ mov and his friends defended at the Congress? It was autonomism (unless it was anarchism) that Martov and Axelrod defended at the Congress of the League when they, with amusing zeal, tried to prove that the part need not obey the whole, that the part is autonomous in its relation to the whole, that the rules of the League Abroad, in which these relations are formulated, are valid regardless of the will of the Party majority, regardless of the will of the Party centre.
It is precisely autonomism that Comrade Martov defends today in the columns of the new Iskra (No.
60) on the question of the Central Committee appointing members to the local com­ mittees.
* I shall not speak of the puerile sophistries which Comrade Martov used at the Congress of the League to defend autonomism, and still uses in the new Iskra1—I think it im­ portant to point to the undoubted tendency to defend auto nom-ism against centralism as a principle which is the character­ istic feature of opportunism on organisational questions.
The only attempt to analyse the conception of bureaucracy seems to be contained in the distinction drawn by the new Iskra (No.
53) between “formally democratic and formally bureaucratic principles” (the italics are the author’s).
This distinction (which, unfortunately, has remained as undevel­ oped and unexplained as the allusion to the non-Iskra-ists) con­ tains a grain of truth.
Bureaucracy versus democracy is the same thing as centralism versus autonomism, it is the organisa­ tional principle of revolutionary political democracy as opposed to the organisational principle of the opportunists of Social-Democracy.
The latter want to proceed from die bottom up­ ward and, consequently, wherever possible and to the extent that it is possible, it supports autonomism and “democracy,” which may (by the over zealous) be carried as far as anarchism.
The 1 In enumerating the points of the rules.
Martov left out the point which deals with the relation of the whole to the part: the C.

former proceed from the top, and advocate the extension of the rights and powers of the centre in respect of die parts.
In the epoch of dispersion and circles the role of this top, which rev­ olutionary Social-Democracy tried to take as its organisational starting point, was inevitably played by the circle which was most influential because of its activity and its revolutionary consistency (in our case, die Iskra organisation).
In the period when the real unity of the Party has been restored and the now obsolete circles have been dissolved in this unity, the Party Congress, as die sovereign organ of die Party, necessarily be­ comes this top; the Congress as far as possible unites the re­ presentatives of all the active organisations; it appoints the central bodies (with a personnel which may sometimes satisfy the advanced elements in the Party more than it does the back­ ward elements and be more to the taste of its revolutionary wing than of its opportunist wing) and leaves them at die top until the next Congress.
This at any rate is the custom among the European Social-Democrats, although gradually, not without difficulty, opposition and squabbles, this custom, which is so fundamentally hateful to the anarchists, is beginning to spread even among Asiatic Social-Democrats.
It is well worth noting that these fundamental characteristics of opportunism on organisational questions (autonomism, gentle­ man’s or intellectual anarchism, khvostism and Girondism) are, mutatis mutandis, observed in all the Social-Democratic Parties all over the wrorld, wherever the Party is divided into a revolutionary wing and an opportunist wing (and what Party is not thus divided?).
Quite recently this came to light in a particularly striking way in the German Social-Democratic Par­ ty, when its defeat at the election in the twentieth electoral division of Saxony (“the Gohre1 incident”) raised the question 1 Gohre was returned to the Reichstag on June 16, 1903, in the fifteenth division of Saxony, but resigned after the Dresden Congress; the electors of the twentieth division, which had been made vacant by the death of Rosonow, wanted to offer the candidature to Gohre.
The Central Council of the Party and the Central Agitation Committee for Saxony opposed this, and although they were not formally entitled to annul the candidature of Gohre, they succeeded in obtaining his withdrawal.
At the polls the Social-Democrats were defeated.
of the principles of the Party organisation.
That this should have become an issue of principle was mainly due to the zeal of the German opportunists.
Gohre (an ex-parson, the author of the well-known book Drei Monate Fabrikarbeiter and one of the “heroes’’ of the Dresden Congress * was an extreme opportun­ ist, and the Sozialistische Monatshejte, the organ of the consist* ent German opportunists, at once “intervened” in his favour.
Opportunism in programme matters is naturally connected with opportunism in tactics and opportunism in matters of organisation.
Comrade Wolfgang 'Heine undertook to expound the “now” point of view.
To give the reader an idea of the political complexion of this typical intellectual, who joined the Social-Democratic movement and brought with him opportunist habits of thinking, it will be sufficient to say that Comrade Wolfgang Heine is a little less than a German Comrade Aki­ mov and a little more than a German Comrade Egorov.
Comrade Wolfgang Heine took the warpath in Sozialistische Monatshefte with no less a flourish of trumpets than Comrade Axelrod in the new Iskra, The title of his article itself is price­ less: “Democratic Observations on the Gohre Incident.
” {Sozial­ istische Monatshefte, April, No.
4.
) The contents are no less thundering.
Comrade W.
Heine protests against all “encroach­ ments upon the autonomy of the constituency,” champions the “democratic principle,” and protests against the intervention of the “higher authority” (i.
e.
, of the Central Council of the Party) in the free election of deputies by the people.
The point at is­ sue, says Comrade Heine didactically, is not a casual incident, but “a general tendency towards bureaucracy and centralism in the Party" a trend, he says, which might have been observed before, but which is now becoming particularly dangerous.
We must “recognise the principle that the local institutions of the Party are the vehicles of Party life” (this is a plagiarism of Martov’s pamphlet “Once Again a Minority”).
We must not “get accustomed to having all important political decisions eman­ ating from one centre,” we must warn the Party against “a doctrinaire policy that loses contact with life” (taken from Comrade Martov’s speech at the Party Congress to the effect 29 Lenin 11 that “life will have its own way”).
Comrade Heine proceed« to deepen his argument: “ If we look into the roots of things, if we abstract ourselves from personal conflicts which in this case, as always, played no small part, wc shall find that this bitterness against the revisionists [the italics are the author’s, who is evidently hinting at the distinction between fight­ ing revisionism and fighting the revisionists] expresses most of all the distrust the Party officials entertain towards ‘outsiders' [evidently, Heine has not yet read the pamphlet about the state of siege in our Parly and is reduced to using an Anglicism—“out-sidertum”], the distrust that tradition has for everything un­ familiar, that the impersonal institution has for everything in­ dividual [see the resolution moved by Axelrod at the Congress of the League on the suppression of individual initiative], in a word, that very tendency which we have defined as a tendency towards bureaucracy and centralism in the Parly.
” The idea of “discipline” arouses in Comrade Heine the same noble indignation that it does in Comrade Axelrod.
.
.
.
“The revisionists,” he writes, “have been accused of lack of discipline for having written for the Sozialistischc Monatshefte, the Social-Democratic character of which they even questioned on the ground that it is not controlled by the Parly.
This attempt to narrow the concept ‘Social-Democratic,’ this insistence on discipline in the sphere of ideological production, where complete freedom must reign [cf.
ideological struggle is a process, while forms of org­ anisation are only forms], are sufficient evidence of a trend to­ wards bureaucracy and towards the suppression of individuality.
” And Heine goes on for quite a long time fulminating against this hateful tendency to make “one all-embracing great organ­ isation as centralised as possible, one set of tactics and one theory,” and he fulminates against the insistence on “absolute obedience,” “blind submission,” against “vulgarised centralism,” etc.
, etc.
, literally “a Ia Axelrod.
” The controversy raised by W.
Heine spread further; and as there were no squabbles about co-optation to obscure the issue in the German Party and as the German Akimovs have the op­ portunity* of revealing their countenances in a permanent jour­ nal of their own and not only at congresses—the controversy soon reached the stage of analysing the tendencies of the prin­ ciple of orthodoxy and revisionism in matters of organisation.
K.
Kautsky came out (in Die Neue Zeit, 1904, No.
28, in an article “Wahlkreis und Partei,” [“The Constituency and the Party”]) as one of the spokesmen of the revolutionary wing (which, exactly as in our Party, is, of course, accused of “dic­ tatorship,” and of “inquisitorial” tendencies and other dreadful things).
“W.
Heine’s article,” wrote Kautsky, “reveals the mode of thinking of the whole revisionist school.
” In France and in Italy, as well as in Germany, the opportunists are all for au-tonomism, for a slackening of Party discipline, for reducing it to nought; in all countries these tendencies lead to disruption and to the distortion of the “democratic principle” into an­ archism.
Giving the opportunists a lesson in matters of organ­ isation, K.
Kautsky says: ‘'Democracy is not the absence of authority, democracy is not anarchy, it is control exercised by the masses over their representatives, as distinct from other forms of government under which the supposed servants of the people are in actual fact its masters.
” K.
Kautsky traces in detail the disruptive role of opportunist autonomism in the different countries and shows that it is pre­ cisely the adherence of “a number of bourgeois elements” to Social-Democracy 1 that gives strength to opportunism, to auto­ nomism and to the tendency to violate discipline.
He reminds us again and again that “organisation is the weapon with which the proletariat will win its freedom,” and that “organisation is a characteristically proletarian weapon in the class struggle.
” In Germany, where opportunism is weaker than in France or in Italy, “autonomist tendencies have up to the present only resulted in more or (ess high-flown declamations against dictators and great inquisitors, against anathemas2 and heresy hunting, in endless cavilling and squabbling that would, if the other side replied to it, only result in endless quarrels.
” 1As an example K.
Kautsky mentions Jaurès.
To the extent that they deviate to opportunism people of this type “begin to consider Party discip­ line an intolerable constraint on their free personality.
” 2 Ban ns trahi: anathema.
This is the German equivalent of the Russian “state of siege” and “the exceptional laws.
” It is the “frightful word” of the German opportunists.
It is not surprising that in Russia, where opportunism in the Party is even weaker than in Germany, autonomist trends should have produced fewer ideas and more “high-flown declamations” and squabbling.
It is not surprising that Kautsky arrives at the following con­ clusion : “There is probably no other issue on which the revisionism of different countries, in spite of all its varieties and different shades, is so completely uniform as on the question of organisation.
” To define the tendencies of the principles of orthodoxy and of revisionism in this sphere, Kautsky, too, makes use of a “frightful phrase,” viz.
, bureaucracy versus democracy.
“We are told,” lie writes, “that allowing the Party leadership to influ­ ence the selection of a candidate (for parliament) by the con­ stituencies would be a ‘shameful violation of the democratic principle, which demands that all political activity proceed from the bottom upwards, from the independent activity of the masses, and not from the top downwards by bureaucratic means.
.
.
But if there is a democratic principle, it is that the majority must have its way against the minority and not the other way round.
.
.
.
” The election of a member of parliament by a constituency is an important question for the Party as a whole, and the Party must influence the nomination of a candidate, if only through the medium of the Party’s representatives (Verlrauensrnanner).
“Let those who consider this to be too bureaucratic or too centralistic suggest that candidates be nominated by a vote of the whole Party mem­ bership (sammtlichev Parteigenossen).
He who thinks this is not prac­ ticable has no right to complain of a deficiency of democratic principle when the function, like many other functions of the Party, is exercised by one or by several Party organs.
” In accordance with the “common law” of the German Party the local constituencies used to “come to a friendly agreement” with the Patty leadership about the choice of a candidate.
“But the Party has grown too large for this tacit common law to suf­ fice any longer.
Common law ceases to be a rule when it ceases to be recognised as something self-evident, when its stipula­ tions, or even its very existence, are called in question.
Then it becomes absolutely necessary to formulate the law, to codify it,” to adopt a more “precise statutory definition1 (statutarische Festlegung) and thus increase the strictness (grossere Straff heit) of the organisation.
” So here you have, in different surroundings, the same struggle between the opportunist wing and the revolutionary wing of the Party on the question of organisation, the same conflict be­ tween autonomism and centralism, between democracy and “bureaucracy,” between a tendency to relax and a tendency to tighten up the strictness of organisation and of discipline, be­ tween the mentality of the unstable intellectual and the tempered proletarian, between intellectual individualism and proletarian cohesion.
We may ask, what was the attitude of bourgeois democracy to all this conflict, not the attitude of bourgeois dem­ ocracy which frolicsome history has only promised to show privately to Comrade Axelrod one day, but the actual, real bourgeois democracy which in Germany has spokesmen who are quite as learned and quite as keen observers as our own gentle­ men of Osvobozhdcniye? German bourgeois democracy at once responded to the new controversy and unainimously took the side of the opportunist wing of the Social-Democratic Par­ ty—just as Russian bourgeois democracy would do, and as has always been done in every other country.
Die Frankfurter Zeitung, a leading organ of the German Stock Exchange, in its evening edition (April 7, 1902), published a furious leading article which shows that the shameless plagiarism of Comrade Axelrod is becoming quite a disease in the German press.
The stern democrats of the Frankfort Stock Exchange scourge “autoc­ racy” in the Social-Democratic Party, “Party dictatorship,” “the autocratic domination of the Party officials,” these “anathe­ mas” which are intended “as it were, to chastise revisionism as a whole” (e/, “die false charge of opportunism”), the in-1 It would be very instructive to compare Kautsky’s remarks on the transition from tacitly recognised common law to the formal, fixed statutory law with all the “changes” our Party, in general, and the editorial board, in particular, has undergone since the Party Congress.
See the report of the speech by Vera Zasulich (at the Congress of the League, p.
66 et sup,), who docs not seem to realise the significance of the changes that are taking place.
* sistenœ on “blind submission,” the transforming of members of the Party into “political corpses” (this is somewhat strong­ er language than “cogwheels and screws”).
The indigna­ tion of the knights of the Stock Exchange is aroused by the sight of the undemocratic state of affairs in the Social-Democratic Party: “All personal originality,” all individuality must be persecuted, because thèy threaten to bring about the French state of affairs, Jaurèsism and Millerandism, as was stated in so many words by Zindermann, who reported on the question at the Party Congress of the Saxon Social-Democrats.
■» » * Thus, in so far as the new catchwords uf the new Iskra on the question of organisation have any general meaning at all there cannot be any doubt that they have an opportunist meaning.
This conclusion is confirmed by the results of our analysis of the Party Congress, which divided into a revolutionary wing and an opportunist wing, and by the example of all the Social-Dem­ ocratic Parties of Western Europe where opportunism in the question of organisation found expression in the same tenden­ cies, in the same accusations and very often even in the same catchwords.
Of course, the national peculiarities of the indi­ vidual parties and the different political conditions in the different countries will leave their impress and make German opportunism unlike French opportunism, French opportunism unlike Italian opportunism and Italian opportunism unlike Russian opportunism.
But the uniformity of the fundamental division of all these Parties into a revolutionary wing and an opportunist wing, the uniformity of the argument and tendencies of opportunism in questions of organisation stand out clearly in spite of all this difference of conditions.
1 The multitude of representatives of the radical intelligentsia in the ranks of our Marxists and of our Social-Democrats has been making the pres-1 No one has any doubt today that the old division of Russian Social-Democracy on questions of tactics into Economists and politicians was uniform with the division of the whole of Social-Democracy into opportun­ ists and revolutionaries, although the difference between Comrades Marty­ nov and Akimov on the one hand, and between Comrades von Vollmar and von Elm, on the other, or Jaurès and Millerand, is very great.
Nor will anyone doubt the similarity in the main divisions on the organisa-ence of opportunism inevitable, for it is produced by the men­ tality of the radical intellectual in the most varied spheres and in the most varied forms.
We have fought opportunism on the fundamental problems of our conception of the world, on questions of our programme, and complete divergence of aims has inevitably led to an irrevocable separation between the So­ cial-Democrats and the liberals who had corrupted our legal Marxism.
We have fought opportunism on tactical questions, and our differences with Comrades Krichevsky and Akimov on these less important questions were naturally only temporary, and were not followed by the formation of separate parties.
We must now overcome the opportunism of Martov and Axel­ rod on organisational questions, which, of course, are still less fundamental than questions of programme and tactics, but which have now come to the forefront of the stage in our Party life.
When speaking of fighting opportunism, there is a character­ istic feature of present-day opportunism in every sphere that must never be overlooked: this is its vagueness, its diffuseness, its elusiveness.
The very nature of the opportunist is such that he will always try to avoid formulating the issue clearly and irrevocably; he will always try to find the resultant force, will always wriggle like a snake 'between two mutually excluding points of view, he will try to “agree” with both and reduce his differences of opinion to slight amendments, doubts, innocently good intentions, etc,, etc.
Comrade Eduard Bernstein, an op­ portunist on questions of programme, “agrees” with the revo­ lutionary programme of the Party; and although he is anxious, no doubt, to see it “radically reformed,” he thinks it would be inopportune and inexpedient and that it is more important to bring out “general principles” and “criticism” (which is mainly the uncritical borrowing of the principles and catchwords of bourgeois democracy).
Comrade von Vollmar.
an opportunist lional question, in spite of the enormous difference between the conditions of politically disfranchised and politically free countries.
It is extremely characteristic that the highly principled editors of Iskra, in briefly touch­ ing on the controversy between Kautsky and Heine (No.
64*), timidly evaded the question of the tendencies of principles of all opportunism and of orthodoxy on the organisational question.
on tactical questions, is also in complete agreement with the old tactics of revolutionary Social-Democracy and also confines himself mainly to declamations, to petty amendments, to sneers; he never openly advocates definitely “ministerialist” tactics.
The opportunists on organisational questions, Comrades Martov and Axelrod, have also up to the present failed to produce, though challenged to do so, any definite statement of principles that could be fixed in “a statutory way”; they, too, would like, certainly they would like a “radical reform” of our organisa­ tional rules {Iskra, No.
58,* p.
2, col.
3), but they would prefer to devote themselves first to “general problems of organisa­ tion” (because a really radical reform of our rules, which in spite of point 1 is after all a centralist one, would inevitably lead, if it were carried out in the spirit of the new Iskra, to autonomism; and Comrade Martov, of course, does not like ad­ mitting even to himself that, in principle, his tendency is to­ wards autonomism).
“In principle,” their attitude towards the organisational question displays all the colours of the rainbow: the predominant note is the innocent, pathetic declamations about autocracy and bureaucracy, about blind obedience, about cogwheels and screws—declamations which sound so innocent that it requires no small effort to discern in them what is really concerned with principle and what is really concerned with co­ optation.
But the deeper the woods, the thicker the trees: at­ tempts to analyse and give a precise definition of the hated "‘bureaucracy” inevitably lead to autonomism, attempts to “deep­ en” and to vindicate inevitably lead to a justification of back­ wardness, to khvostism, to Girondist phrases.
At last, as the only really definite principle, which in practice, consequently, stands out with particular relief (practice is always in advance of theory), there emerges the principle of anarchism.
Sneering at discipline—autonomism—anarchism—these are the stairs our organisational opportunism alternately climbs and descends, jumping from step to step and skilfully evading any definite statement of its principles.
1 Opportunism in questions of pro-1 It will now be fully apparent to those who remember the debate on point 1 that the mistake committed by Comrade Martov and Comrade Axelrod on point 1 inevitably leads, when developed and deepened, to gramme and tactics displays exactly the same stages—sneering at “orthodoxy,” narrowness and immobility—revisionist “criti­ cism” and ministerialism—bourgeois democracy.
In close psychological connection with their hatred of disci­ pline there is an incessant, whining note of disgruntledness, which can be detected in all the writings of all contemporary opportunists in general, and of our minority in particular.
They are always being persecuted, restricted, kicked out, besieged and bullied.
These catchwords contain much more psycho­ logical and political truth than the author of the pleasant and witty joke about bullies and bullied probably suspected.
For, indeed, you have only to take the minutes of our Party Con­ gress to see that the minority includes all those who took of­ fence, all those who for one reason or another were offended by revolutionary Social-Democracy.
It includes the Bundists and the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists whom we kept on “offending” un­ til they withdrew from the Congress; the Yuzhny RabochyAste.
who were mortally offended by the suppression of all separate organisations in general and of their own in particular; Com­ rade Makhov who was offended each time he took the floor (be­ cause every time he did so he made a point of disgracinig him-organisational opportunism.
Comrade Martov’s initial idea, self-registration of Party members, is nothing else than false “democracy.
” the idea of building the Party from the bottom upwards.
My idea, on the other hand, is “bureaucratic” in the sense that the Party is built from the top down­ wards, from the Party Congress to the individual Party organisations.
The mentality of the bourgeois intellectual, anarchist phrases, opportunist, khvostist profundity—all these were already discerned in the debate on point I.
Comrade Martov says that “new ideas are beginning to be worked out” by the new Iskra.
This is true in the sense that, beginning with point 1.
he and Comrade Axelrod have been really advancing thought in a new direction.
The one thing wrong is that it is an opportunist direction.
The more they “work” in this direction the deeper will they get stuck in the mire.
This was clear to Comrade Plekhanov at the Party Congress and in his article “What Should Not Be Done?” he warned them once again: I am prepared even to co-opt you, but for goodness' sake do not continue along this road which can only bring you to opportunism and anarchism.
Martov and Axelrod did not follow the good advice: “What? Are we to turn back? agree with Lenin that this co-optation was only a squabble? Never! We will show him that we are men of principle!”—and so they have.
They have chown everyone that in so far as they have any new prin­ ciples, they are the principles of opportunism.
self); and finally, Comrades Martov and Axelrod were offended because they were “falsely accused of opportunism” in con­ nection with point 1 of the rules and because they were defeated in the ballot.
All these mortal offences were not the accident­ al outcome of bad jokes, violent behaviour, furious polemics, slamming of doors and shaking of fists as so many philistines still imagine, but the inevitable political result of the three years of ideological work that Iskra had carried on.
If in the whole course of these three years we not only wagged our tongues but gave expression to convictions that had to lead to action, we could not avoid fighting the anti-/sA:ra-ists and the “Marsh” at the Congress.
And since we, together with Comrade Martov, who fought in the front line with vizor raised, had offended such a lot of people—we had only to offend Comrade Axelrod and Comrade Martov just the tiniest bit for the cup to overflow.
Quantity was transformed into quality.
The negation was negated.
All the offended forgot their mutual squabbles, fell weeping into each other’s arms, and raised the banner of “revolt against Leninism.
” 1 A revolt is an excellent thing when it is the advanced elements that revolt against the reactionary elements.
It is a good thing when the revolutionary wring revolts against the opportunist wring.
But it is a bad thing when the opportunist wing revolts against the revolutionary wring.
Comrade Plekhanov is compelled to take part in this dirty business in the capacity of a prisoner of war, as it wrere.
He tries to “vent his feelings” by fishing out isolated clumsy phrases written by authors of resolutions in favour of the “major­ ity” and exclaims as he does so: “Poor Comrade Lenin! What fine orthodox supporters he has!” {Iskra, No.

However poor I may be I am a thousand times better off than those whose supporters do not inadvertently utter a clum­ sy phrase, but on all issues, whether of organisation, of tactics or of programme, zealously and steadily advocate principles which are opposed to the principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy.
However poor I may be I haxc not yet reached the stage where I have to conceal from the public the praise lav­ ished on me by such supporters.
But the editors of Iskra have to do this.

is? If you do not, read the minutes of the Party Congress.
You will discover that the line of that committee is adequately expressed by Comrade Akimov and Comrade Brooker who at the Congress fought the revolutionary wing of our Party all along the line, and who have been ranked as opportunists scores of times by everybody, from Comrade Plekhanov to Com­ rade Popov.
Well, this Voronezh Committee, in its January leaflet (No.

Convening a congress is a very complicated business, and under monarchist conditions it is a dan­ gerous, a difficult business.
Consequently, it is not surprising that the busi­ ness was carried out in a far from perfect way, and that the Congress it­ self, although it passed off quite successfully, did not fulfill all the Party’s expectations.

, who hitherto had appeared to be fully in agreement with the Iskra programme of action, have admitted that many of its views, which were supported mainly by Lenin and Plekhanov, are impractical.
Although the latter got the upper hand at the Congress, the mistakes of the theo­ reticians were soon corrected by the forces of real life and the demands of real work in which all non Iskra-ists also take part, and after the Congress important amendments were introduced, “Iskra’ has undergone a profound change and promises to give careful attention to the demands of workers in the Social-Democratic movement in general.
Thus, although the work of this Congress will have to be revised at the next congress, and, as is obvious to the delegates, was unsatisfactory, and therefore can­ not be accepted by the Party as unimpeachable decisions, the Congress has cleared up the situation inside the Party, has collected much material for the theoretical and organisational work of the Party, and has been an immensely instructive experience for the work of the Party in general.
The decisions of the Congress and the rules drawn up by it will be taken into account by all the organisations, but in view of their obvious imper fections, many will not be guided exclusively by them, “Realising the importance of the common work of the Party, the Voronezh Committee has actively responded to all the questions con* cerning the organisation of the Congress.
It recognises the importance of what took place at the Congress and welcomes the change undergone by “Iskra* which has become the central organ.
Although the state of affairs in the Party and in the central organ does not yet satisfy us, we trust that with a common effort the difficult work of organising the Party will be made more perfect.
In viewT of false rumours, the Voronezh Committee informs the comrades that there can be no question of the Voronezh Committee withdrawing from the Party.

Besides, the Second Congress was not an inaugural congress but an ordinary congress.
Expulsion from the Party can only take place on the decision of a Party court, and no organisation, not even the Central Committee, has the right to expel any Social-Democratic organisation from the Party.
What is more, the Second Congress passed point 8 of the rules, which makes every organisation autonomous (independent) in its local affairs, and this entitles the Voronezh Committee to put its org* anisational views into practice and advocate them in the Party" The editors of the new Iskra* in quoting this leaflet in No.
61, reprinted the second half of what wc have quoted and which is here printed in large type; as for the first half, which is here printed in small type, the editors preferred to leave it out.
They wore ashamed.

Something About Dialectics Tico Revolutions x A general glance at the progress of our Party crisis will very easily show that with minor exceptions the composition of the two opposing sides has in the main remained unchanged; it has been the struggle between the revolutionary wing and the op­ portunist wing in our Party.
But this struggle has passed through exceedingly different stages, and anyone who wants to understand the mass of literature that has been accumulated, the mass of frag­ mentary evidence, of passages torn from their context, of isolated accusations, and so on, must make himself familiar in detail with the peculiarities of each of these stages.
Let us enumerate the principal stages which may be clearly distinguished from each other: 1) The controversy over point 1 of the rules.
A purely ideological struggle around the basic principles of organisation.
Plekhanov and I are left in the minority.
Martov and Axelrod propose an opportunist formula and find themselves in the arms of the opportunists.
2) The split in the hkra organisation on the question of the lists of candidates for the Central Committee: Fomin or Vasilyev in the group of five, Trotsky or Travinsky in the group of three.
Plekhanov and I gain a majority (nine to seven), to a certain extent precisely because we were in a minority on point 1.
Martov’s coalition with the opportunists confirms all my fears that had been raised by the O.
C.
incident.
3) Continuation of the debate on the details of the rules.
Martov is again rescued by the opportunists.
We are again in the minority and we in­ sist on the rights of the minority in the centres.
4) The seven extreme opportunists leave the Congress.
We become the major­ ity and defeat the coalition (Jskra-ist minority, ‘‘Marsh” and anti-/skra-ists) at the elections.
Martov and Popov decline to take their seats in our groups of three.
5) The post-Congress squabble about co-optation.
An orgy of anarchist behaviour and anarchist phrases.
The least stable and least steady elements of the “minority” get the upper hand.
6) To prevent a split, Plekh­ anov adopts the policy of “killing with kindness.
” 1 The “minor­ ity” takes possession of the editorial board of the C.
O.
and of the Council and attacks the C.
C.
.
with all its might.
The squabble continues to pervade everything.
7) The first attack on the C.
C.
is repelled.
The squabble seems to be subsiding.
It becomes possible to discuss in comparative calm two purely ideological questions which greatly excite the Parly: a) the question of the political -significance and the explanation of the division of our Party into a “majority” and a “minority” which took shape at the Second Congress and replaced all previous divisions, and b) the position of the new Iskra on the question of organisa­ tion.
Each one of these stages is marked -by an essentially different situation in the stnigglc and in the immediate object of the attack; each stage is, as it were, a separate battle in one and the same campaign.
Our struggle cannoit be understood unless a study is made of the concrete situation in each battle.
When we have done -that we shall find that development does actually proceed dialectically, by way of contradictions: the minority becomes the majority, the majority becomes the minority; each side passes from the defensive to the offensive, and from the offensive to the defensive; the starling point of the struggle (point 1) is “negated,” and gives way to an all-pervading squabble,1 2 but then begins the “negation of the negation” and.
after having managed somehow to live more or less harmoni­ ously with our God-senit wife in the various centres, we once more return to the starting point of the purely ideological struggle, but this time the thesis has been enriched by all the re­ sults of the “antithesis” and has become a higher synthesis, in 1 English in the original.
Plekhanov said that he had embraced the Martovists in order to stifle them.
—Ed.
2 The difficult problem of drawing a line between squabbles and dis­ sensions on principles thus solves itself: all that refers to co optation is squabble; all that refers to the analysis of the struggle at the Congress, to the dispute on point 1 and to the turn in the direction of anarchism and opportunism, are dissensions on principle.
wIlich the isolated, accidental error of point 1 has grown into a quasi-system of opportunist views on the question of organ­ isation, in which the connection between this phenomenon and the basic division of our Party into a revolutionary wing and an opportunist wing becomes increasingly apparent to ail.
In a word, not only do oats grow according to Hegel but the Russian Social-Democrats wage war among themselves according to Hegel.
But the great Hegelian dialectics which Marxism, after hav­ ing put it on its feet, made its own, must never be confused with the vulgar procedure of justifying the zigzags of politicians who swing over from the revolutionary wing to the opportunist wing of the Party, or with the vulgar habit of lumping together all the individual statements, the individual moments in the development of the various stages of a single process.
Genuine dialectics does not justify individual errors; it studies the in­ evitable turns and proves their inevitability by means of a thorough, detailed analysis of the process in all its concreteness.
The fundamental thesis of dialectics is: there is no such thing as abstract truth, truth is always concrete.
One more point: the great Hegelian dialectics must never be confused with that vul­ gar worldly wisdom so well expressed by the Italian phrase: mellere Ia coda dove non il capo (to put the tail in where the head will not go).
The result of the dialectical development of our Party strug­ gle has been two revolutions.
The Party Congress was a real revolution, as Comrade Martov rightly remarked in his article, “Once Again a Minority.
” The jesters of the minority are also right when they say: revolutions move the world, so we made a revolution! They did indeed make a revolution after the Con­ gress; and it is true that, speaking generally, it is revolutions that move the world.
But the concrete significance of each con­ crete revolution is not defined by this general aphorism; there are revolutions that are more like reaction, to paraphrase tire unforgettable expression of die unforgettable Comrade Makhov.
We must ascertain whether it was the revolutionary wing or the opportunist wing of the Party that was the real force which made the revolution, we must ascertain what principles inspired the fighters—revolutionary or opportunist—before we can de­ termine whether the “world” (our Party) was moved forward or backward by a given concrete revolution.
Our Party Congress was unique and unprecedented in die history of the Russian revolutionary movement.
Foor the first time a secret revolutionary party succeeded in emerging from the darkness of underground into broad daylight, and showed all and sundry the progress and outcome of the struggle inside our Party, showed the face of our Party, and the face of each one of its more or less noticeable sections in questions of programme, tactics and organisation.
For the firdt time we suc­ ceeded in getting rid of the traditions of circle looseness and revolutionary philistinism, we succeeded in bringing together dozens of the most varied groups, many of which had been fiercely hostile ito each other, which were united only by the power of an idea and prepared (prepared in principle) to sacrifice all their group separateness and group independence for the great whole, which we are creating for the first time— the Party.
But in politics sacrifices are not obtained gratis, they have to be taken in battle.
The battle to kill the separate org­ anisations was necessarily very fierce.
The breeze of open and free struggle became a gale.
The gale swept away every conceiv­ able remnant—and an excellent thing that it did so!—of circle interests, sentiments and traditions without exception, and for the first time produced official bodies that were really organs of the Party.
But it is one thing to call oneself something, and another to be it.
It is one thing to sacrifice the circle spirit for the Party in principle, another thing to renounce one’s own circle.
The breeze proved too strong for those wTho were used to musty philistinism.
As Comrade Martov rightly put it (accidentally) in his article “Once Again a Minority,” “the Party was unable to stand its first Congress.
” The sense of grievance for the kill­ ing of the organisations rankled too much.
The furious gale raised all the mud from the bed of our Party stream, and the mud is taking its revanche.
The old, hardened circle spirit got the better of the newly bom Party spirit.
The opportunist wing of the Party, crushing! y defeated at first, got the better of the revolutionary wing—for the time being, of course—by being re* inforced by the accidental capture of Akimov.
The iresult was the new Iskra, which is forced to develop and deepen the error its editors committed at the Party Congress.
The old Iskra taught the truths of revolutionary struggle.
The new Iskra teaches the worldly wisdom of yielding and getting on with everyone.
The old Iskra was the organ of militant ortho­ doxy.
The new Iskra brings us a recrudescence of opportunism— mainly on questions of organisation.
The old Iskra earned the honourable dislike of both Russian and Western opportunists.
The new Iskra has “grown wise’* and soon will no longer be ashamed of the praise lavished upon it by the extreme opportun­ ists.
The old Iskra marched unswervingly towards its goal, and there was no discrepancy between its words and its deeds.
The inherent falsity of the position of the new Iskra inevitably— irrespective of anyone’s will and intention—leads to political hypocrisy.
It cries out against the circle spirit in order to camou­ flage the victory of circle spirit over Party spirit.
It pharisaic­ ally condemns a split, as if one can imagine any other way of avoiding a split in a party that is at all organised except by the submission of the minority to the majority.
It insists on the necessity of taking revolutionär}’ public opinion into account and at the same time, while it tries to conceal the praise of the Akimovs, it goes in for petty scandal-mongoring about the com­ mittees of the revolutionary wing of the Party!1 Shame! How they have disgraced our old Iskral One step forward, two steps back.
.
, .
Such tilings happen in the lives of individuals, and in the history of nations, and in the development of parties.
It would be criminal cowardice to doubt for one moment the inevitable and complete triumph of die principles of revolutionary Social-Democracy, of proletar* ian organisation and of Party discipline.
We have won a great 1A stereotyped form has been adopted for this pleasant pastime: our special correspondent X informs us that Committee of the majority Y has behaved badly to Comrade Z of the minority.
30 Lento II deal, and we must go on fighting undeterred by reverses, fight­ ing steadfastly, despising the philistine methods of circle squabble, doing all we can to preserve the single party organisa­ tion of Russian Social-Democracy which has been established at the cost of such effort, and by dint of tireless and systematic work we must make every Party member, and the workers in particular, fully and intelligently understand his Party duties, the struggle al the Second Party Congress, and all die causes and all the stages of our disagreements; so that he may learn how disastrous is opportunism, which in the sphere of organisation surrenders as helplessly to bourgeois psychology, as uncritically adopts the point of view of bourgeois democracy, and blunts the weapon of die class struggle of the proletariat, as it does in the sphere of our programme and of our tactics.
In its struggle for power die proletariat has no other weapon but organisation.
Divided by die rule of anarchic competition in die bourgeois world, ground down by slave labour for capital, constantly dirust back to the “lower depths” of utter destitution, savagery and degeneration, the proletariat can be­ come, and will inevitably become, an invincible force only when its ideological unity round the principles of Marxism is con­ solidated by the material unity of an organisation, which unites millions of toilers in the army of the working class.
Neither the decrepit rule of Russian tsarism, nor the senile rule of interna­ tional capital will lie able to withstand this army.
It will close its ranks more tightly than ever, in spite of all zigzags and steps backward, in spite of all the opportunist phrases of the Gir­ ondists of modern Social-Democracy, in spite of the smug praise of out-of-date circle spirit, in spite of all the tinsel and fuss of intellectual anarchism.
LETTER TO V.
A.
NOSKOV, MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE* September 11, 1904.
Dear Comrade! You inform me again that the “Central Committee” has ex­ pressed the wish that I join the editorial board of the C.
O.
And I in turn must repeat that this, to say the least, is inaccur­ ate, When you made the formal statement that the declaration of the C.
C.
in question was adopted unanimously by the C.
C.
, all being present except one, 1 immediately replied (August 18, 1904) that this was not true.
The declaration was signed by three members of the C.
C.
out of a total which only recently was nine; and -these three quite illegally declared that Comrade Ossipov was not a member of the C.
C.
, while the latter wrote to me stating that he still considered himself to be a member.
It was illegal to announce that a comrade had resigned without discussing the matter with him.
Both the arguments with which you and your two colleagues tried to justify this illegal act are plainly invalid.
You slated that Comrade Ossipov had form­ ally resigned at the preceding ordinary meeting of the C.
C.
This is not true, for at the end of May (i.
e.
, several months after that meeting, which took place in February or in March) we re­ garded the C.
C.
as consisting of nine members, and this is certi­ fied by the agreement of May 26, 1904, which is signed by three members of the C.
C.
and by the letter appended to that agreement.
** You stated that after that meeting Comrade Ossi­ pov joined a local committee, which a member of the C.
C.
is not entitled to do.
Comrade Ossipov has written to me on this point, stating that he had been sent to take part in the local work of the district in question on the proposal of precisely those members of the C.
C.
who now declare that he is no longer a 467 .
%• member, and that he did not work as a formal member of tlie committee.
Besides, even if a member of the C.
C.
had actually ir­ regularly and against the rules joined a local committee, it does not follow that the only way of correcting this irregularity is for the member to resign from tlie C.
C,; he could resign from the local committee.
Finally, you yourselves were forced to ad­ mit in your letter to me that the three members of the C.
C.
re­ ceived a report to the effect that the resignation of Comrade Ossi-pov was a debatable question.
That this question should have been decided by three members of the C.
C.
in tlie absence of Ossipov, and without even hearing what Ossipov had to say, was a patent and outrageous breach of the rules.
Of course, the three mem­ bers of the C.
C.
could count on the support of the Party Coun­ cil which is controlled by the editors; of course, the three mem­ bers of the C.
C, could rely on die bargain that has been form­ ally concluded, or tacitly accepted, with the supporters of the minority in the Council.
But this would not mend matters, it would aggravate them by elements of political bad faith.
It was equally wrong for the three members of the C.
C.
to accept the resignation of Comrade Travinsky, of which not all the mem­ bers of the C.
C.
had been informed prior to the meeting.
So far you have been unable to give me any exact information as to when this resignation was handed in, and to whom.
The only reply you made sounded like an insult.
You said: “Inquire of the collegium in Russia/’ and yet you had just come from this collegium (the same collegium of three!), while I have no means of communicating with the said collegium except through you!! Hence, I challenge the validity of the composition of tlie C.
C.
and of its last meeting (at which the “declaration” was adopted).
This would entitle me to leave your proposal that I join the editorial board of the C.
O.
unanswered.
But I take this pro­ posal as emanating not from the C.
C.
but from three members of tlie Party, and I consider it my duty to give a reasoned re­ ply, the more so since you say it is the wish of the editors of the central organ, stated in written form to you, that I become a member of tlie editorial board.
You believe that my joining the editorial board of the C.
O.
“would secure almost complete peace in the Party, which I am so anxious to have,” This “almost” of yours is highly charac­ teristic! Yes, I am anxious to have peace in the Party; in Decem­ ber 1903 I made an offer of peace in the press, in a letter to the editors of Iskra (“Why I Resigned from the Editorial Board of Iskra”1), I made another official offer of peace to the Party Council in January 1904.
Peace was not accepted on the terms I offered at that time in the name of the majority.
I may remark that, contrary to the present fashion of uttering hypo­ critical phrases about “peace,” when by peace is meant surren­ dering to the minority on all points, completely ignoring the majority and forgetting all about the Congress, I stated quite definitely before the Council what I understood by peace in the Party.
I and my fellow delegate of the C.
C.
to the Council plainly stated that by peace we meant purging the ideo­ logical struggle of all disputes about precedence, squabbles and other dishonest methods of struggle.
Let the C.
O.
remain under the control of the minority and the C.
C.
under the control of the majority—I proposed at that time—let us appeal to everyone to stop all boycotting, all squabbling about prece­ dence and co-optation, and let us in a comradely way dis­ cuss our disagreements and the causes of our disagreements at the Congress, let us train the Party honestly and in a dignified way to examine internal controversies.
My appeal was ridiculed by Plekhanov and Martov.
I am not at all surprised that they have adopted the disgraceful decision to withhold publication of the minutes of the Council (in spite of the insistence of the minority on the Council, viz.
, two representatives of the C.
C.
), or that the three members of the C.
C.
should now (se­ cretly) endorse that decision.
Those who try to achieve a hypo­ critical peace by taking advantage of accidents that are unavoid­ able in the lives of Russian revolutionaries, and by kicking out of the C.
C.
those who think differently from them? will also nec­ essarily be anxious to conceal from Party members the attempt Hn this volume, pp.
380-87.

2 This refers primarily to Comrade Ossipov.
And, secondly, of course, to myself, for the proposal that I join the editorial hoard of the C.
0 is equivalent to a proposal that T resign from the €.
C: • to achieve an opportune and honourable peace.
Fortunately I have reason to believe that this miserable contrivance, intended to deceive the Party, will fail, and that after all the minutes of the Council meeting will be published.
* Immediately after the editors who had usurped control of the Council scornfully rejected my peace proposal, I stated that I considered a congress to be the only honest way out.
The tactics of the minority (including Plekhanov) are to keep control of the editorial board of the C.
O.
and of the Council, to pretend to represent the interests of the Party as a whole on these cen­ tral bodies, and at the same time to try to secure, without a congress, the reorganisation of the C.
C.
in the interests of the minority.
I cannot regard these tactics as honest fighting.
I have never entered into any bargains with supporters of tactics like these, and do not consider it possible to enter into any.
Besides, since last January the political complexion of the new Iskra has become sufficiently clear; it is the central organ of scandal and squabbling, of muddleheadedness in arguments and of flirting with opportunists, of settling personal accounts and fishing for dissensions.
That the new Iskra is the organ of a circle, the organ of a new “trend,” is clear to everyone, even to the editors themselves, who at first tried to vindicate “continuity,” but have now adopted the course of systematically spitting at the old Iskra.
The question is, in what sense can we speak of peace today? If by peace we mean purging the ideological struggle of squabbles about co-optation, I am even now fully prepared to agree to peace and to repeat the proposal I made in the Council.
But if by peace we mean the cessation of the ideological struggle, conciliation with the trend, or rather with the political complexion which has no trend, of the new Iskra, then such a “peace” can only be proposed by unprincipled people, or by hypocrites, or by those for whom the or­ gans of the Party are so much newsprint (Druckerschwärze, printer’s ink, as one of the “conciliators” called the literature of the new Iskra).
If the editors of the new Iskra, who have reduced all their positions “on principle” to personal attacks on me, to the persecution of what they have christened ‘*Leninism.
” and to fishing for points of difference with me, if they now ex­ press the wish to see me a member of the editorial board, it only means that they do not take their own writings seriously, that all their polemics were only invented for the sake of “co­ optation,” and that they are prepared to throw all their new “principles” overboard now that co-optation has been safely se­ cured.
As for me, I reject as unworthy the very suggestion that the majority give up the Party struggle for its position, its struggle for a consistent trend, its struggle against the circle spirit I regard it as my inalienable right and duty to carry on this struggle jointly with die supporters of the principles of the majority, whose number in Russia is growing.
I believe that the struggle must be carried on openly, because nine-tenths of the history of the conflict has already been made public, and all further attempts to conceal it from the eyes of the world would prolong the crisis in a petty and absurd way.
You write that “many committees, too, undoubtedly wish” me to join the present editorial board of Iskra.
I regret to have to state that in this loo you are uttering a deliberate untruth.
In the present condition of the struggle, no committee has as yet ex­ pressed auch a wish.
It has only been expressed by the editorial circle of the C.
O.
and by three members of the C.
C.
who con­ sider it the acme of political wisdom to join the minority in abusing the majority and the majority in abusing the minority.
I believe that my duty is to heed, not the will of certain polit­ icians, but the will of the Party, which has laid down a method for giving formal expression to its will, viz.
, a congress.
I be­ lieve that a leader who adopted a definite line at the Congress and led a section of the Party in the direction of that line would lose every claim to ^respect or even to have his words taken seriously if he deserted to the side of his opponents.
Your reference to “many committees” is very instructive and significant, in spite of its .
.
.
complete divergence from the truth.
It testifies to the fact that you have still preserved a shred of Party conscience, that you still realise to some extent that of­ ficial institutions appointed by the Party must comply with the will of the Party when they undertake to reconstitute the centres and to change their policy.
If this consciousness were not ob­ scured in you by the confused position you have adopted, you would have no difficulty in seeing that there is no other way of really ascertaining the real desire of really numerous commit­ tees, than by convening a congress.
But while your reference to “many committees” betrays in you a shred of Party con­ science it also very clearly testifies to an uneasy conscience.
You dread a congress above all things, because you realise the cry­ ing contradiction between your irresponsible policy and the will of the Party.
My general remarks about the hypocrisy of the attempts at conciliation you are making are fully confirmed by a number of additional facts.
Three members of the C.
C.
now admire the “high level” of the C.
O.
, while last March these very three members of the C.
C.
drew up a statement expressing regret that certain Party writers (the majority of the present editorial board of the C.
O.
) should have dropped into opportunism.
While speaking about “peace” these three members of the C.
C.
dis­ solve the Southern Bureau (a collegium of agents of the C.
C.
*) because supporters of the majority had worked in it and had had the insolence to agitate in f avour of a congress.
While speak­ ing about peace between the two opposing sides the three mem­ bers of the C.
C.
hold a conference with representatives of one side, but ignore the other.
** What demoralisation is introduced, into the Party by these private and privy transactions which af­ fect the basic interests of the whole Party and which are so carefully kept secret from it, although there is no need whatever for conspirative secrecy! What a mass of mutual distrust and sus­ picion is introduced in Party life by these tricks behind the back of die Party! Only today I .
received a letter from a comrade in Russia who writes about the rumours that are circulated con­ cerning these transactions: it is said in Party circles that three sections have been formed among the minority; one demands first of all that Dan and Trotsky be co-opted to the Central Committee, and will not listen to anything short of that; the second agrees to a conference; the third will be satisfied with a fjmple declaration on the pari of the C.
C», and this section in­ eludes the Yuzhny Rabochy-isls (who very rightly interpret the establishment of a popular organ as a masked restoration of Yuzhny Rabochy which was dissolved by the Congress).
I do not know what is true in this Party talk.
But that the minority consists of various groups; that Comrade Brooker, for instance, most probably takes no part in the “ultimata” of the minority or in any of the squabbles about co-optation; that the Yuzhny Rabochy group presents a substantially different shade of opin­ ion—are all well-known facts, with which everyone who has studied our Party Congress is familiar.
Do you not see how humiliating is all this huckstering of separate groups that goes on behind the back of the Party! Is it surprising that the hypo-qrisy of throe members of the Central Committee should make the majority which stands aloof from all these intrigues so com­ pletely distrustful of them? Is it surprising that the “peace” in­ augurated by disbanding those who agitate for a congress is in­ terpreted as a preliminary to the systematic manipulation of Party public opinion? Is it surprising that the majority suspects a deal between the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
(and, consequently, the Council) to put the minority on the committees by force and to withhold the publication of the resolutions of the majority (the St.
Petersburg and Ekaterinoslav resolutions* tvhich have been held up for several months), etc.
, etc.
? I hope you will now understand why, as long as tlie present situation in the Party lasts, there can be no thought of my join­ ing the editorial board of the central organ.
Your statement that I “abstained” from voting on the ques­ tion of co-opting three members of the C.
C.
is not true.
I strongly protest against considering the “elections as having taken place,” This is another breach of die rules.
It is the duty of all three members of the Central Committee to consider my protest; and only after that can they raise the question of co­ optation.
According to the rules, co-optation must be unanimous; I have never given my consent.
Consequently, without the mat­ ter being brought before the Council there can be no talk about co-optation having taken place.
The decision of the Council (if you irregularly bring up the question there before the consti-tub on of the C.
C.
has been examined by all the members of the QC.
) must be communicated to me together with the minutes of the Council.
I cannot share your regret at our having failed to meet.
After your tricks with Comrade Ossipov and your attitude to your pledged word (agreement of May 26, 1904) I do not wish to have anything to do with you, except in a purely official way» and only in writing.

THE ZEMSTVO CAMPAIGN AND ISKRA’S PLAN * 1 FOR PARTY MEMBERS ONLY A letter to the Party organisations has just been issued bear­ ing the signature of the editorial board of Iskra (and marked ‘Tor Party members”).
Russia has never been within such easy’ reach of a constitution as she is today, say the editors, and they proceed to outline a detailed plan for a “political campaign,” a plan to influence the liberal Zemstvo-ists who are petitioning for a constitution.
Before we analyse the new Iskra’s plan, which is exceedingly instructive, let us recall how the question of our attitude to the liberal Zemstvo-ists has been formulated in the Russian Social -Democratic Party in the past, since the working class movement arose.
Everyone is aware that tins was one of die questions on which, almost from the very beginning of the rise of the mass labour movement, a struggle arose between the “Economists” and the revolutionaries.
The former went so far as to deny the exist­ ence of bourgeois democrats in Russia, and to ignore the task of the proletariat of influencing the opposition strata of society; at the same time, by narrowing the range of the political struggle of the proletariat, they, consciously or unconsciously, left the role of political leadership to the liberal elements of society and assigned to the workers the “economic struggle against the em­ ployers and the government.
” The adherents of revolutionary So­ cial-Democracy in the old Iskra fought against this trend.
This struggle can be divided into two main periods: the period before the appearance of the liberal journal Osvobozhdeniye and the 1 In addition to the introduction, only chapters n, in and TV of this article are given in thia edition, the last chapter being slightly abbrevi ated.
—Ed.
475 period after that1 During the first period we directed our attack mainly against the narrowness of the Economists, we tried to “lead them up” to the fact, which they failed to note, of the ex­ istence of bourgeois democrats in Russia; we emphasised the task of giving the political activity of the proletariat the widest scope, of extending its influence to all strata of society, of its becom­ ing the vanguard in the struggle for freedom.
The more the ad­ herents of the new Iskra grossly pervert the history of this per­ iod (see Trotsky’s “Our Political Tasks,” published by the editors of Iskra?), and the more they gamble on the young people of today not being familiar with the recent history of our movement, the more appropriate and necessary is it today to recall that period and its main features.
The appearance of Osvobozhdeniye marked the beginning of the second period in the old Iskras fight.
When the liberals came out with a journal and a political programme of their own, the proletariat’s task of influencing “society” was naturally changed: working class democrats could no longer confine them­ selves to trying to “shake up” the liberal democrats and to stirring up a spirit of opposition among them; it had to place revolutionary criticism of the half-hearted political attitude of liberalism, which was now so clearly revealed, at the corner-stone of its policy*.
Our attempts to influence the liberal strata took the form of repeatedly pointing out the inconsistency and the insuf­ ficiency of the political protest of the liberals (it is sufficient to recall Zaryas criticism of Mr.
Struve’s preface to the Witte Memorandum8 and numerous articles in Iskra).
By the time the Second Party Congress was convened this new attitude of the Social-Democrats towards the liberals, who had now come out openly, had taken definite shape and was firmly established; no one questioned the existence of bourgeois dem­ ocrats in Russia any longer, or whether the opposition move­ ment should be supported (and the kind of support that should.

be given) by tlie proletariat The only issue was how to formu­ late the Party’s view of the question; and it will suffice if I point out that the views of the old Iskra found much more ad­ equate expression in the resolution proposed by Plekhanov, which emphasised the anti-revolutionary and anti-proletarian character of die liberal Osvobozhdeniye, than in the confused resolution proposed by Starover, which on the one hand aimed (quite inopportunely) at an ‘agreement'’ with the liberals, and, on the other hand, proposed for such agreements conditions that were fictitious and obviously such as the liberals could not carry out? II In speaking of the bogey that appeared to our editors in their dreams, we left out a characteristic little detail in their argu­ ment, The editors attacked the discrediting tactics that would tend to extract from the Zemstvo-isls “a formal promise to pre­ sent our demands to the government.
” 2 Apart from the absurd­ ities we have already drawn attention to, the very notion that “our” demands, the demands of working class democracy, should be presented to the government by the liberal democrats is a queer one.
On the one hand, precisely because they are bourgeois democrats, the liberal democrats will never be able to under­ stand “our” demands and to advocate them sincerely, consistent­ ly and resolutely.
Even if our liberals gave, “voluntarily” gave, a formal promise to present our demands, they would, of course, fail to keep the promise and would deceive the proletariat.
On the other hand, if we are strong enough to exercise serious influ­ ence on bourgeois democrats in general, and on Messieurs the Zemstvo-ists in particular, we are also strong enough to present our demands to the government independently.
The editors’ queer idea is not a slip of the tongue, but die in­ evitable consequence of the confused position they have taken up on this issue.
Listen: “The central focus and leading thread must be the practical task .

anised influence on the bourgeois opposition’; ‘the draft stale* ment of the workers to a given organ of the bourgeois opposi­ tion” must contain “an explanation of the reasons why the work­ ers, instead of approaching the government, approach an as­ sembly of spokesmen of the opposition.
” To put the question in tliis way is a radical mistake.
We, the party of the proletariat, must, of course, “approach all classes of the population,” and openly and energetically champion our programme and our im­ mediate demands before the whole of die people; we must try to present these demands to Messieurs the Zemstvo-ists too; but our central focus and leading thread must be pressure not on the Zemstvo-ists, but on the government.
The editors of Iskra have turned the question of the focus upside down.
The bourgeois opposition is merely bourgeois and merely an opposition pre­ cisely because it does not fight, because it has no programme of its own to which it gives unconditional support, because it stands between the two fighting parties (the government, and the revolutionary proletariat plus a very few supporters among the intelligentsia), and hopes to turn the outcome of this struggle to its own advantage.
It follows that the hotter the struggle grows and the nearer the moment of the decisive battle draws, the more must we concentrate our attention and direct our pressure on our actual enemy, and not on an ally who is notoriously an ally with reservations, a problematic and unreliable ally, a semi-ally.
It wrould be wrong to ignore this ally, it would be absurd to try to intimidate and frighten him—but all this is so obvious that it seems queer to insist on it.
But, I repeat, the central focus and leading thread of our agitation must not be pressure on this ally, but preparation for the decisive battle against the enemy.
While it has been flirting with the Zemstvo and made some paltry concessions to it, the government has not yet made a single concession to the people; the government is still in a position to revert to (or rather to continue) its reac­ tionary course, as has been the case in Russia tens and hundreds of times after the momentary liberal inclinations of this or that autocrat.
It is precisely at a moment like this, when the Zemstvo is being flirted with and when the people are being hoodwinked and lulled by empty words, that we must be parti e« ularly on our guard against the fox’s brush, we must with partic­ ular insistence remind everybody that the enemy has not been defeated yet, we must call with particular energy for the con­ tinuation and the tenfold intensification of the fight against the enemy, and not shift the centre of gravity from “approaching” die government to approaching the Zemstvo.
Lt is precisely at the present moment that all the notorious cream skimmers and traitors to liberty go out of their way to concentrate the atten­ tion of society and of the people on the Zemstvo and to inspire confidence in the Zemstvo, which does not in the least deserve the confidence of genuine democracy.
Take Novoye Vrernya': in the article quoted above you will find the following piece of reasoning: “It :s clear to everyone that from the moment it be­ comes possible fearlessly and truthfully to discuss our defects and shortcomings and for every public man to act freely, it will not be long before we see die last of those shortcomings, and before Russia is able without apprehension to take that path of progress and improvement which she needs so badly.
Wc need not even trouble to invent the organisation, the instru­ ment tliat will bring about this progress: it exists already in the form of the Zemstvo, which needs only [!!] the freedom to grow; therein lies the guarantee of an improvement that will be native, and not borrowed.
” Language like this not only “con­ ceals the desire for a limited monarchy and a constitution based on a property franchise” (as the editors put it in another pas­ sage of their letter); it simply prepares the ground for confin­ ing the whole business to smiles for die Zemstvo, without even limiting the monarchy in the least! To insist on pressure being brought on the Zemstvo as the central focus, instead of pressure on the government, naturally gives rise to the unfortunate idea which lay at the basis of Star-over’s resolution—the idea of trying to find, at once and with­ out delay, a basis for an “agreement” with the liberals.
“In rela­ tion to the present Zemstvos,” the editors say in their letter, “our * New Times, the most Influential reactionary paper, which chiefly ex­ pressed the views of the government.

task reduces itself [!!] to presenting to them those practical demands of the revolutionary proletariat which they must sup­ port in order to be entitled to at least some right to speak in the name of the people and count on the active support of the working masses.
’’ A good definition of the tasks of a working class party, to be sure! At a time when an alliance between the moderate Zemstvo-ists and the government to fight the revolution­ ary proletariat is becoming possible and probable (the editors themselves admit the possibility of such an alliance), we are told that our task “reduces itself,” not to the tenfold intensifica­ tion of our efforts in the struggle against the government, but to the elaboration of the casuistic terms of an agreement with the liberals to render each other mutual support If I present to another person demands which he pledges himself to support in order to be entitled to my support, the transaction cannot be described otherwise than as an agreement.
And we ask every­ body: wliat lias become of the “terms” of the agreement with the liberals drawn up in Star over’s resolution1 (which was also signed by Axelrod and Martov), and the impracticability of which had already been predicted in our press? The editors’ letter does not even mention these terms.
The editors got the re­ solution passed at the Congress only to throw it into the waste­ paper basket afterwards.
At the very first attempt to tackle the matter in practice it became apparent that if Starover’s “terms” were presented they would only provoke the Homeric laughter of Messieurs the liberal Zemstvo-ists.
Let us proceed further.
Can we admit that it is right in prin­ ciple to set the working class party the task of presenting to lib­ eral democracy, or to the Zemstvo-ists, political demands “which they must support in order to be entitled to at least some right to 1 Let us remind the reader that Starover’s resolution, passed by the Congress (against my opinion and Plekhanov’s), makes temporary agree­ ments with the liberals subject to three conditions: 1) the liberals “will clearly and unambiguously announce that in their struggle with the gov­ ernment they unconditionally take the side of Social-Democracy”; 2) “they will not include in their programmes any demands that might run counter to the interests of the working class and democracy, in general, or obscure its class consciousness”; 3) ’‘they will make universal, equal and direct suffrage and secret ballot the slogan of the struggle” speak in the name of the people”? No, to do so would be wrong in principle, and would only lead to obscuring the class con­ sciousness of the proletariat and to the most futile casuistry.
To speak in the name of the people is to speak as a democrat.
Any democrat (and any bourgeois democrat) is entitled to speak in the name of the people, but only to the extent that he champions democracy consistently, resolutely and to the end.
It follows that every bourgeois democrat has “at least some right to speak in the name of the people” (because, as long as he remains a dem­ ocrat, every bourgeois democrat champions some democratic de­ mands), but at the same time no bourgeois democrat is entitled to speak in the name of the people all along the line (for today no bourgeois democrat is capable of resolutely carrying demo­ cracy through to the end).
Mr.
Struve is entitled to speak in the name of the people in so far as Osvobozhdeniye fights against the autocracy; but Mr.
Struve has no right to speak in the name of the people in so far as Osvobozhdeniye writhes and wriggles, confines itself to a constitution based on a property franchise, puts the Zemstvo opposition on a par with struggle, and avoids formulating a consistent and clear democratic programme.
The German National-Liberals* were entitled to speak in the name of the people in so far as they advocated the freedom of mov­ ing from place to place.
The German National-Liberals had no right to speak in the name of the people in so far as they sup­ ported the reactionary policy of Bismarck.
It follows that to set the working class party the task of pre­ senting demands to Messieurs the liberal bourgeoisie, by sup­ porting which they would acquire the right to speak in the name of the people, is to invent a futile and absurd task.
There is no need for us to invent any special democratic demands apart from those that are contained in our programme.
In the name of that programme it is our duty to support any democrat (and this includes any bourgeois democrat) in so far as he champions democratic principles; it is our duty ruthlessly to expose every democrat (and this includes the Socialist-Revolutionary) in so far as he deviates from democratic principle (as, for instance, in such questions as the freedom of the peasant to leave the 31 L emu 11 commune ar to sell his land).
To attempt to determine before­ hand the measure, so to say, of permissible turpitude, to attempt to fix beforehand what deviations from democratic principles are permissible for a democrat, is such a clever idea that we are tempted to suspect that either Comrade Martynov or Comrade Dan must have had a hand in helping our editors to produce it III After expounding their leading political arguments in their letter, the editors proceed to expound the details of their great plan.
The Gubernia Zemstvo Assemblies are to petition for a con­ stitution.
In the towns of N, X, Y, our committeemen plus the advanced workers are to draw up a plan for a political cam­ paign “according to Axelrod.
” The central focus of all agitation is to be: influencing the bourgeois opposition.
An organisation group is to be elected.
The organisation group is to elect an ex­ ecutive committee.
The executive committee is to elect a special spokesman.
Efforts are to be made “to bring the masses in touch with the Zemstvo Assemblies, to concentrate the demonstration around the very premises where the Zemstvo councillors sit.
Some of the demonstrators are to penetrate into the meeting room; at the proper moment, the spokesman specially appointed for this purpose is to ask the Assembly [? ask the Marshall of Nobility who presides at the Assembly?] for permission to read out the statement of the workers.
If this is refused the spokes­ man is to enter a vehement protest against the Assembly which presumes to speak in the name of the people, but refuses to hear the voices of the representatives of the people.
” Such is the new Iskras new plan.
We shall see presently how modestly it is appraised by the editors themselves, but let us first quote the highly principled explanations of the editors concern­ ing the function of the executive committee: “.
.
.
The executive committee must take measures beforehand to prevent the appearance of several thousand workers in front of the premises where the Zemstvo councillors sit and of several dozens or hun­ dreds in the building itself from causing panic [!!] among the Zemstvo-Ute under the influence of which they would be capable of throwing themselves [1] upon the shameful protection of the police and the Cos* sacks, and thus transform a peaceful demonstration into a disgraceful fracas and a savage assault and distort its meaning.
[The editors ap­ parently believed in the reality of the bogey that appeared to them in their dreams.
In fact, in the literal grammatical meaning of the phrase, the editors seem to imply that the Zemstvo-ists will transform the demonstration into an assault and thus distort its meaning.
We have a very poor opinion of the Zemstvo liberals, but the panicky terror of the editors lest the liberals in a Zemstvo assembly call the police and the Cossacks seems to us to be quite ridiculous.
Anyone who has ever been in a Zemstvo Assembly will know that police will be called for, if there is a so-called breach of the peace, either by the presiding Mar­ shall of Nobility, or by the police officer who is unofficially present in the next room.
Or do the members of the executive committee intend to explain to the police officer that it is not part of the “plan” of the editors of the new Iskra to transform a peaceful demonstration into-a savage assault?) “.
.
.
In order to avoid such a surprise the executive committee must inform the liberal councillors beforehand .
.
.
[so that they might give a ‘"formal promise” not to call for the Cossacks?] of the forthcoming demonstration and of its true object.
.
.
.
[i.
e.
, to inform them that it is not our true object to be savagely assaulted and thus have die meaning of Axelrod’s plan distorted] .
.
.
Furthermore, it must try to reach some kind of agreement [listen!] with the representatives of the Left wing of the bourgeois opposition and to secure, if not their active support, at any rate, their sympathy with our political action.
The negotiations must, of course, be conducted in the name of the Party on the instructions of workers* circles and meetings, which should not only discuss the general plan of the political campaign, but also hear reports of its progress—the rules of secrecy being, of course, strictly observed?’ Yes, yes, we can see with our own eyes that Starover's great idea of an agreement with the liberals on the basis of precisely defined conditions is growing and becoming stronger at a furious rate.
It is true that all these definite conditions have been shelved “for the time being’’ (we ane not sticklers for form, are we!), but on the other hand an agreement is being arrived at without delay, vu.
, an agreement not to cause panicky fear.
Whichever way one looks at the editors’ letter one cannot read any other meaning into the notorious “agreement” with the lib­ erals than the one we have pointed to, viz.
, either it is an agreement about the terms that wrould entitle the liberals to speak in the name of the people (and in that case the very idea of con­ cluding such an agreement very seriously compromises the So­ cial-Democrats wrho advance it), or else it is an agreement not to cause panic, an agreement to sympathise with a peaceful dem­ 31 onstration—and in that case it is just rubbish which can hardly be discussed seriously.
The absurd idea of the central importance of bringing pressure to bear upon the bourgeois op­ position rather than upon the government could not result in anything but an absurdity.
If we are able to organise an im­ posing mass workers’ demonstration in the hall of a Zemstvo Assembly, of course, we shall do so (although when we have sufficient forces for a mass demonstration it will be much better not to “concentrate” these forces in front of ‘ the premises” of the Zemstvo Assembly, but rather in front of the premises of the assemblies of the police, of the gendarmes or of the cen­ sors).
But to be guided on that occasion by such considerations as the panic of the Zemstvo people, and to carry on negotia­ tions to that effect, is the height of folly, the height of absurdity.
The very content of a speech by a consistent Social-Democrat will always and inevitably rouse panicky fear among a large number, probably among the majority, of the Russian Zemstvo-ists.
Parleys with the Zemstvo-ists about the undesirability of that sort of panic would place one in a very false and undigni­ fied position.
Panicky fear of another kind will inevitably be caused by the savage assault or by the prospect of it.
It would be very foolish to start negotiations concerning this panicky fear with the Zemstvo-ists, because even the most moderate liberal will neither call for such an assault nor sympathise with it; but this matter is beyond his control.
Wbat we want is not “negotia­ tions,” but the practical preparation of forces, not pressure on the Zemstvo-ists, but pressure on the government and on its agents.
If we have no force behind us, it is better not to hold forth at all about great plans; but if we have the force, then we must oppose tliis force to the Cossacks and the police, we must try to gather a crowd of such dimensions and in such a spot as will enable it to repel, or at least to deter, the onslaught of the Cossacks and the police.
And if we are capable of ex­ ercising, in deeds and not in words, “impressive organised influ­ ence upon the bourgeois opposition,” it will, of course, not be by silly “negotiations” about not causing a panicky fear, but by force, the force of mass resistance to the Cossacks and the tsarist police, the force of a mass offensive capable of growing into a popular insurrection.
The editors of the new Iskra take a different view of these matters.
They are so pleased with their plan of an agreement and negotiations that they cannot find enough praise to lavish upon it The active demonstrators must be “imbued with an understanding of the fundamental difference between an ordinary demonstration against the police, or against the government in general, and a demonstration, the immediate object of which is to fight absolutism by the revolutionary proletariat directly influencing the political tactics [so that’s how it is!] of the liberal elements at the present [italicised by the editors] mo­ ment.
.
.
.
In order to organise a demonstration of the usual, so to say, general democratic [!! ] type, a demonstration which does not set itself the immediate aim of concretely opposing the revolutionary proletariat to the liberal bourgeois opposition as two different political forces, the mere presence of strong political ferment among the masses is quite sufficient .
.
.
.
It is the duty of our Party to utilise this state of mind of the masses even for this inferior type [hear! hear!] of mobilisation of the masses against absolutism.
.
.
.
We are taking our first [!] steps on a new [!] path of political activity, on the path of organising this kind of planned intervention of the working masses [N.
B.
] in public life, the immediate object of which is to oppose them to the bourgeois opposition as an independent force, opposed to it as regards class inter­ ests, but which, nevertheless, offers it terms [what terms?] for a com­ bined energetic struggle against the common enemy.
” It is not given to everybody to appreciate the profundity of tihis remarkable disquisition.
The Rostov demonstration,* at which the aims of socialism and the demands of workers’ democracy were expounded before an audience of thousands and thousands of workers, is an “inferior type of mobilisation,” the ordinary, general democratic type, it does not concretely oppose the rev­ olutionary proletariat to the bourgeois opposition.
But when a spokesman specially appointed by an executive committee, which is elected by an organisation group, which is formed by the com­ mitteemen and active workers—when that spokesman, after pre­ liminary negotiations with the Zemstvo-ists, utters a loud pro­ test in the Zemstvo Assembly against their refusal to hear him— that will be opposing two independent forces in a “concrete” and “direct” way, that will be exercising “direct” influence on the tactics of the liberals, that will be “a first step on the new path.
” For God’s sake, gentlemen! Martynov himself in the worst days of Rabocheye Dyelo was never quite as vulgar as this! The mass meetings of workers in the streets of the Southern towns, dozens of working class speakers, direct encounters with the real force of tsarist autocracy—all this is an “inferior type of mobilisation.
” An agreement with the Zemstvo-ists about our speaker making a peaceful speech, after having pledged himself not to cause panic among Messieurs the liberals—that is a “new path.
” Here you have, then, the new tactical tasks, the new tac­ tical ideas of the new Iskra, which have been announced to the world with such pomp by the editorial Balalaykin,* On one point this Balalaykin has unwittingly spoken the truth: there is, indeed, a gulf between the old and the new Iskra.
The old Iskra had no other words but words of contempt and ridicule for people who are capable of going into ecstasies over a theatric­ ally staged agreement between classes, as if it wTere a “new path.
” We have long been familiar with this particular new path, thanks to the experience of those French and German So­ cialist “statesmen” who also regard the old revolutionary tactics as an “inferior type,” and are never tired of praising “planned and direct intervention in public life” in the form of agreements to allow working class speakers to make peaceful and modest speeches after negotiations with the Left wing of the bourgeois opposition.
The panicky fear of the liberal Zemstvo-ists fills the editors with such panicky fear that they insistently recommend “partic­ ular caution” to those who are to take part in the “new” plan they have invented.
“As an extreme case in the sense of external caution when actually carrying.
out the action,” says the letter, “we visualise the sending of the workers’ statement by mail to the homes of the councillors and scat­ tering a considerable number of copies in the Zemstvo Assembly hall.
Only from the point of view of bourgeois revolutionism [wc/], which regards the external effect as everything and the process of the planned development of class consciousness and initiative of the proletariat as nothing, can one be embarrassed by this.
” We aret not the sort of people to be embarrassed by the mail­ ing or the spattering of leaflets, but we shall certainly always be embarrassed by stilted and hollow phrase-mongering.
To make the mailing and scattering of leaflets the occasion for talking with a serious air about the process of planned development of the class consciousness of the proletariat one must be a verit­ able hero of smug banality.
To shout from the housetops about the new tactical tasks, only to reduce it all to the mailing and scattering of leaflets, is indeed priceless.
It is ex­ ceedingly characteristic of the representatives of the intellectual shade in our Party, who are now hysterically rushing about in search of a new tactical catchword, now that their new organisa­ tional catchwords have ended in fiasco.
And yet, with their usual modesty, they talk about the vanity of external effects.
But don’t you see, my dear sirs, that at best, even in the event of your alleged new plan being entirely successful, the only thing a workingman, speaking before an assembly of Messieurs the Zemstvo-ists, would attain would be precisely the external effect? And don’t you see that it is impossible to talk of such a speech exercising “impressive” influence on “the tactics of the liberal elements” except by way of a joke? Is it not the other way round? Have not the mass demonstrations of the workers, which you think are mere demonstrations “of the usual, general dem­ ocratic lowest type,” exercised really impressive influence on the tactics of the liberal elements? And if the Russian proletariat is destined once again to exercise influence on the tactics of the liberals, believe me, it will be by a mass offensive against the government, and not by agreements with the Zemstvo-ists.
iv The Zemstvo campaign, launched with the gracious permis­ sion of the police, the sweet speeches of Svyatopo Ik-Mirsky and of the government press, the rising tone of the liberal press, the animation of what is known as educated society—all these things impose the most serious tasks upon the workers’ party.
But these tasks are quite perversely formulated in the letter of the editors of Iskra, Today, more than ever, the proletariat must concentrate its political activity on organising impressive in­ fluence on the government, and not on the liberal opposition.
Agreements between the workers and the Zemstvo-ists concern­ ing peaceful demonstrations—agreements which will inevitably degenerate into the staging of musical comedy effects—are less than ever appropriate at the present time.
The consolidation of the advanced revolutionary elements of the proletariat in pre­ paration for a decisive struggle for freedom is more urgent than ever at the present time.
Precisely now, when our constitutional movement is beginning to reveal the ancient sin of all bourgeois liberalism, and of Russian liberalism in particular—excessive*y involved phrases, the misuse of words which do not correspond to deeds, a purely philistine trustfulness in the government and in every hero of foxy policy—phrases about the undesirability of frightening and striking panic in the hearts of Messieurs the Zemstvo-ists, about a lever of reaction, etc.
, etc.
, are more tact­ less than ever.
Now more than ever is it necessary to strengthen in the revolutionary proletariat the firm conviction that the pres­ ent “emancipation movement in society’* will inevitably and certainly turn out to be as much of a soap bubble as has every preceding one, unless the force of the toiling masses, capable of and prepared for insurrection, intervenes.
The political excitement of the most varied strata of the people, which is the necessary condition for making insurrec­ tion posable and a token of its success, a token that the in-itative of the proletariat will find support, is incessantly spread­ ing, growing and becoming more acute.
Consequently, it would be very unwise for anyone at this moment to begin shouting about immediately launching the attack, to begin calling for the formation of storm columns immediately, etc.
The whole course of events is a guarantee that in the very near future the tsarist government will get into a still worse tangle and that the ex­ asperation against it will become still more menacing.
The gov­ ernment will get entangled in the game it has started with the Zemstvo constitutionalists.
Whether it makes some paltry con­ cessions, or whether it makes no concessions whatever, discon­ tent and irritation will inevitably become still more widespread.
The government will inevitably get into a tangle with its shame-ful and criminal Manchurian adventure.
which will give rise to a political crisis both in the event, of a decisive military de­ feat and in the event of the war, so hopeless for Russia, drag­ ging on.
* It is the business of the working class to widen and strengthen its organisation, to intensify its agitation among the masses ten­ fold, to take advantage of every vacillation of the government, to carry on propaganda in favour of insurrection, and, pointing to the example of all the halfway “steps” that were foredoomed to failure from the start, and about which so much fuss is now being made, to explain that insurrection is necessary.
It goes without saying that the workers must respond to the Zemstvo petitions by calling meetings, scattering leaflets, organising de­ monstrations wherever it has sufficient forces to do so, in order to present all the Social-Democratic demands, regardless of the “panic” of Mr.
Trubetskoy and his like,** and regardless of the outcry of philistines about a lever of reaction.
And if we may risk speaking in advance, and from abroad at that, about the possible and desirable type of mass demonstrations (because de­ monstrations that are not mass demonstrations have no signi­ ficance whatever), if we are to raise the question of the partic­ ular premises before which the forces of the demonstrators should be concentrated, we should point to the premises in which the police business connected with fighting the working class movement is transacted, we should point to the premises of the police, gendarme and censorship offices, to the places of confine-merit of political “offenders.
” The workers roust lend serious support to the Zemstvo petitions, not by concluding agreements about the terms on which the Zemstvo might be allowed to speak in the name of the people, but by striking a blow at the enemies of the people.
And -we can scarcely doubt that the idea of such a demonstration will find sympathy among the proletariat.
The workers hear stilted phrases and loud promises from all sides.
They see the real—insignificant but nevertheless real— extension of liberty for society (a slackening of the bridle on the Zemstvos, the return of banished Zemstvo-ists, relaxation of the censor’s ferocity towards the liberal press), but the work­ ers *ee nothing whatever that extends their liberty to carry on their political struggle.
Under pressure of the revolutionary onslaught of the proletariat the government has allowed the lib* erals to talk a little about liberty! The lack of rights and the downtroddenness of the slaves of capital become more strik­ ingly obvious to the proletarians.
The workers have neither ubiquitous organisations for the relatively free (by Russian standards) discussion of political matters, nor any rooms to hold meetings in, the workers have no newspapers of their own, and their exiled and imprisoned comrades have not been re­ stored to them.
The workers are beginning to see that the skin of the bear—which they have not yet killed, but which only they, only the proletarians, have seriously wounded—is begin­ ning to he divided by Messieurs the liberal bourgeoisie.
The workers see that Messieurs the liberal bourgeoisie, as they start dividing the anticipated skin, are already snapping their teeth and snarling at the “extremist parties,” at the “enemies at home,” the relentless enemies of bourgeois rule and bourgeois peace.
And the workers will rise still more fearlessly, in still greater numbers, to finish the bear, to conquer by force for themselves that which Messieurs the liberal bourgeoisie promise to give them as charity—the freedom of assembly, the freedom of the workers* press, complete political liberty for the wide and open struggle for the complete victory of socialism.

* Iskra—Spark.
The idea that it was necessary to establish a polit­ ical newspaper occurred to Lenin when he belonged to the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle (see IT hat Is To Be Done?, page 54), and he again thought about it when he was in exile in Siberia.
Lenin took part in the unsuccessful attempt to revive the Kiev Rabochaya Gazcta (Workers' Ga­ zette), which was adopted as the central organ by the First Congress of the Party, and he was even nominated for the post of editor.
At the beginning: of 1900, when Lenin and other old members of the St.
Peters­ burg League of Struggle returned from exile, a conference was held in the town of Pskov, which included Lenin, Martov, Potresov and Radchenko, representing the Social-Democrats, and Struve and Tugan-Baranovsky, representing the “legal Marxists,” to discuss the question of issuing a newspaper (the future Iskra), The Emancipation of Labour group was also invited to join in issuing the paper.
In August 1900, Lenin and Potresov travelled to Switzerland for the punpose of arranging for the publication of the paper, and while there, they carried on negotiations with the Emancipation of Labour group.
These negotiations nearly came to nought owing to the attitude of Plekhanov, who feared that if the editorial board were situated in Ger­ many, as was intended, it would be beyond the control of the group and of himself as the actual leader of the group.
(Cf.
“How the ‘Spark’ Was Nearly Extinguished,” Collected Works, Vol.
IV, Book 1, p.
23.
) Iskra began publication in December 1900, in Munich, Germany.
The editorial board consisted of Plekhanov, Axelrod and Vera Zasulich, rep­ resenting the Emancipation of Labour group, and Lenin, Martov and Potresov, representing the Social-Democrats in Russia.
Most of the edi­ torial work was performed by Lenin, and Plekhanov and Martov wrote a great deal for it.
N.
K.
Krupskaya acted as sub-editor from April 1901 onwards.
Simultaneously with the publication of Iskra, a theoretical magazine Zarya (Dawn) was published, edited by the same board.
In April 1902, Iskra began to be published in London.
Iskra immediately attracted the attention of the whole of the Social-Democratic movement in Russia.
It was illegally smuggled into Russia and was read with avidity in Social-Democratic circles by professional revolutionaries and by the workers.
Iskra, which was principally guided by Lenin, waged a ruthless strug­ gle against Economism, against its repudiation of the political struggle, 493 its khivstism, i.
e.
, dragging at the tail of the movement, and its primitive methode in matters of organisation.
Gradually, the overwhelming major­ ity of the local Social-Democratic organisations grouped themselves around Iskra and deserted the Economists.
The followers of Iskra became the most active workers in the Social-Democratic movement: they distributed the paper, established new contacts with the workers, came to be the leaders of local committees, strove to win over every Social-Democratic or­ ganisation to the principles and tactics for which Iskra stood, and main­ tained contacts with the editors abroad.
Thanks to Lenin’s guidance, Iskra became not only the militant, ideo­ logical centre of proletarian socialism, but also tho practical, organ­ ising, Social-Democratic centre, around which the local organisations united.
The part played by Iskra and the Iskra organisation in giving definite shape to the whole of the Social-Democratic movement in Russia is an exceptional one.
It not only fought for the victory of the revolu­ tionary Marxian trend in the Social-Democratic movement, but con­ centrated all the efforts of the Social-Democrats on the task of estab­ lishing a centralised, all-Russian Party organisation on the basis of Lenin’s organisational principles.
(On the role of the Iskra organisation and of Iskra in the formation of the Party and on the preparations for the Second Congress, see note to page 341* in this volume.
) Iskra reacted to all the fundamental questions of political life.
It gave replies to the complicated questions of theory, tactics and organisation of the labour movement; it gave a definite evaluation of the relation of class forces in Russia, emphasised the enormous importance of the polit­ ical struggle of the working class and also correctly defined the role of the various social groups and elements in the struggle against the autocracy.
It closely watched the manifestations of the liberal opposition movement and untiringly fought against its half-heartedness; it explained and exposed the petty-bourgeois nature of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and championed proletarian socialism as against petty-bourgeois social­ ism.
Iskra closely watched every fact concerning the mass labour and peasant movement.
Dealing with every aspect of the struggle of the working class in other countries, Iskra, under Lenin’s guidance, strongly emphasised the international character of the labour movement and at the same time fought against international opportunism, revisionism, no less strenuously than it fought against the Russian variety, Economism.
When the Iskra trend had become strong and had succeeded in winning the majority of the local organisations, Iskra began to make preparations for the Second Congress of the Party.
It drew up a draft programme for the Party and in particular devoted a great deal of attention to the preparatory work for drafting an agrarian programme for the Party.
The discussion of questions concerning the Party iprogramme revealed a difference of opinion on the editorial board of Iskra between Lenin and Plekhanov.
(C/.
"Criticism of Plekhanov’s Second Draft,” pp.
231-33 in this volume.
) A number of the main postulates of the labour movement and of the proletarian party, which later formed part of the armoury of Bolshevism, were first formulated in the columns of Iskra by Lenin.
At that time the influence of Lenin was felt very strongly in Iskra, and for that reason Iskra is quite correctly called the first real Bolshevik newspaper.
At the Second Congress of the Party, held in 1903, Iskra was adopted as the central organ of the Party.
The controversy at the Congress over the composition of the editorial board of the paper was one of the reasons why the Party split into a majority and minority—hence the tenns Bolshevik, which means those belonging to the majority, and Menshevik, which means those belonging to the minority.
This in fact was a split into an orthodox, Marxian faction, the Bolsheviks, and an opportunist faction, the Mensheviks.
In order to ensure single and firm guidance for the paper, Lenin proposed that an editorial board of three be elected, to consist of himself.
Plekhanov and Martov.
Martov and others, however, proposed that the old editorial board continue to serve.
The Congress adopted Lenin’s proposal, upon which Martov refused to serve on the board.
The internal Party strife, which then began, and the ambiguous attitude adopted by Plekhanov, who submitted more and more to the pressure of the Mensheviks, caused Lenin also to resign from the board.
Plekhanov was thus left in sole control of the paper.
He co-opted all the previous members of the board, in this way surrendering Iskra to the Mensheviks; subsequently he joined their ranks himself.
This brought the history of the old Iskra, which was a brilliant example of a consistent, Marxian revolutionary newspaper, to a close.
In form and substance, Iskra became the organ of the Mensheviks.
Zarya (Dawn) was the theoretical organ of the Iskra group and began publication in the spring of 1901.
This magazine published a number of Important articles dealing with questions of programme and policy.
Only four numbers of the magazine were published, one of which was a double number.

* Lenin dealt with the Special Supplement to Rabochaya Mysl (Porkers' Thought) in “A Retrograde Trend in Russian Social-Dem­ ocracy” (Collected Porks, Russian ed.
, Vol.
II), where he discussed in detail the leading article cf that supplement entitled "Our Realities.
” The contention of that article was that that struggle was desirable which was possible under the present circumstances, and that it was the fight which the workers were already carrying on that was possible.
It was further ex­ plained that two kinds of struggle were “possible”: the “partial” struggle for the improvement of the position of the workers in an individual fac­ tory and the “political” struggle “for improving the position of all the workers, as for instance, by means of labour protection laws.
” This passage shows that the opportunist standpoint of Rabochaya Mysl reduced the political, as well as the economic, struggle to a struggle for gradual reforms.
The idea of socialism wae given an equally op* portunist interpretation.
.
Socialism,” said the leading article of the Special Supplement to Rabochaya My si, “which is the outcome of the evolution of the social methods of modern production, and which inevitably leads to the com­ plete socialisation (even on a world scale) of all its means, is merely the further and higher step in the development of 'modern society.
’” Lenin pointed out that this obscured the goal of socialism; that this way of formulating the question (borrowed from Bernstein) would be endorsed by all the liberals aud all the bourgeoisie—the enemies of socialism.
It is perfectly clear, Lenin wrote, that the “editors of Raboch-aya Mysl rank as socialism only the sort that can be obtained by peace' jul, as distinct from revolutionary, means.
To narrow socialism in this way and reduce it to common-or-garden bourgeois liberalism is a tre­ mendous step backward, as compared with the views of all the Russian, and of the enormous, overwhelming majority of European Social-Demo­ crats.
” “Of course, the working class would prefer to take power into its hands by peaceful means (we have already pointed out that this capture of power can be effected only by the organised working class that has graduated in the school of class struggle), but for the proletariat to reject the revolutionary capture of power would be folly both from the point of view of theory and of political practice, and would be tanta­ mount to capitulation before the bourgeoisie and all the propertied classes.

** The Self-Emancipation of the Working Class group was a small and uninfluential organisation.
It arose in St.
Petersburg in January 1899, and was organised by K.
A.
Popov, V.
A.
Kozhevnikov and Malinin (a worker).
It w'as broken up by the police in April of that year.
During its brief period of existence it drew up an appeal to the workers (men­ tioned and analysed by Lenin in What Is To Be Done? [in this volume!), a set of rules and two or three manifestoes.

* Rabocheye Dyelo (Workers’ Cause), the organ of the League of Russian Social-Democrats, wrote: “We have become firmly convinced that the Credo merely represents the opinions of individuals, and only reflects the ideological muddle in the heads of its writers.
” In a letter to N.
K.
Krupskaya, Lenin characterised the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists as follows: “The tactics of the Rabocheye Dyelo-ists are the tactics of concealing the extremes of Economism, of defending Econom-ism from direct attacks upon it, of permitting the free criticism of Marxism on the part of all the open and ‘masked ideologists of the bourgeoisie/ ” Pace 15.
* An article published in Rabocheye Dyelo under the title “A Historical Change” provided Lenin with the occasion for exposing the lack of political principles of that group.
Just before that Rabocheye Dyelo had defended the opponents of the political struggle who regarded the fight against tsarism as having been instigated by intellectuals.
Rabocheye Dyelo disputed the clause in the programme of the Emancipation of Labour group (1885), which said that the overthrow of tsarism must be the first political objective of the workers.
Rabocheye Dyelo maintained that ‘‘today and in the near future—and still more so in 1885—the overthrow of absolutism cannot be the "first political objective of the workers* groups.
* Political tasks in the real, practical sense of that word, i.
e.
, in the sense of co-ordinated and successful practical struggle for political demands, are beyond the understanding of workers’ groups.
** Rabocheye Dyelo went on to admit that a working class movement which had assumed a mass character could carry on a political struggle.
But for tactical considerations the task of overthrowing absolutism could not be put to this mass move­ ment as its “jirst** political task.
After having made statements like these, the editors of Rabocheye Dyelo wrote the article, ‘‘A Historical Change,” in which under the influence of the demonstrations and of the rise of the students’ and workers* movements they made a volte face and asserted that the country was on the eve of a revolution.
“If only our Party,” they wrote, “had at its disposal a strong fighting organisation and adequate forces, it would be able to find firm ground for a "direct and mass attack against tsarism-* ” Pace 17.
* The question of terrorism as new tactics that should be adopted by the Social-Democrats was brought to the forefront by the Econ­ omists in the article “A Historical Change” which appeared in Listok Rabochevo Dyela, No.
6.
In the beginning of 1901, terrorist acts became more frequent (Karpovich’s attempt on the life of Bogolepov, the Minis­ ter of Education who had conscripted the students into the army, and Lagovsky’s attempt on the life of Pobedonostsev, Procurator of the Holy Synod).
This gave new life to terrorist tendencies.
They commanded the sympathy of the Russian liberals, and even of many Socialist leaders in Western Europe.
Even individual Social-Democrats were affected by the terrorist craze.
In “A Historical Change” (see preceding note), the editors of Raboch­ eye Dyelo wrote: “The shots of Kanpovich and of Lagovsky and the warm sympathy they have met with on the part of the young people and of all the revolutionary elements in general are clear indications that with the inevitable force of a natural law the White Terror of the tsarist government is preparing the ground for the Red Terror of the revolutionaries.
” S3 Lenin ll Iskra repeatedly and emphatically pronounced itself against individual terrorism» and against the mistaken attitude of the Economists towards the question.

** The events referred to by Lenin are the mass demonstrations of February and March 1901, which took the form of direct revolution­ ary action against the government.
On March 4 (February 19), 1901, a demonstration took place in Kharkov; it was organised by the students and supported by the workers.
On March 13 (February 28), there was a tremendous demonstration in Moscow which developed out of the stu­ dents* disorders, and on March 17 (4), a students* demonstration took place in St.
Petersburg, which met with sympathetic response throughout the length and breadth of Russia.
It ended in a wholesale beating up of the demonstrators on the Kazan Square.
The workers assimilated the political slogans in an unprecedentedly active way, though the demon­ strations were for the most part spontaneous.
At that time many of the Social-Democratic organisations were under Economist influence and re­ acted very feebly to these demonstrations; they regarded them as political action.
Only the firm attitude of hkra changed this state of affairs and the result was that the Social-Democrats headed the movement.
Pace 25.
* What Is To Be Done? This is one of the works of Lenin which must be read in order to understand the principles of Leninism and the history of the Party.
Written in 1902, in the period of the acute struggle between the Iskra-ists and the Economists, in the period be­ tween the First and Second Congresses of the Russian Party, it served as a guide to the problems that confronted the Russian Parly at that time, and serves as a guide to the problems that confront some of the Communist Parties in Europe and America today.
On the eve of the Second Congress and the formation of the Bolshevik ‘‘trend of political thought in the Party’* the question of the day was that of “defining the general principles and fundamental tasks of any Social Democratic policy in general” (Lenin.
) Au important problem that confronted the Party at that time was the problem of cadres, of building the Party apparatus.
Today, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has grown into a mass proletarian, party, the problem of cadres and of the Party apparatus is, in the main, solved in a different way from that in which it was solved in the pre-October days and particularly in the period dealt with in What Is To Be Done? Nevertheless, the idea of forming an “organisation of professional revolutionaries’* that Lenin advanced in this pamphlet, in the main, still holds good today, as do the other organisational principles enumerated therein.
Without this firm skeleton the Party wTould never have grown into the militant party it was and is, it would never have been able to lead the workers to vic­ tory in th« proletarian revolution and guide the first country in the world that is building socialism.
The odd Leninist guard, which to this day per­ sonifies the solidarity, firmness and durability of the Party, was brought up in the traditions of the professional revolutionaries.
The professional revolutionary is one who loyally devotes his whole life to the cause of the Party and of the working class.
The Iskra period, the ideas of which are summed up in this pamphlet, was the period in which the Party was still in the process of formation.
A single centralised organisation that could weld the scattered Social-Democratic circles, working with primitive methods, into one whole was still lacking.
The Economists insisted on working on the old primitive lines.
Only by defeating the Economists was Iskra able to convene the Second Congress and lay the foundations for a centralised Party.
The pamphlet IT hat Is To Be Done? played an enormous part in defeating the Economists.
The problem of creating a centralised Party, with which, in the main, this pamphlet deals, was in Lenin’s opinion “the main link” which, if grasped by the party of the proletariat, would enable it successfully to march further forward.
The organisation of a centralised Party is an essential condition for the proper leadership of the work­ ing class.
But not only that; the Party must be the vanguard of the working class and.
moreover, it must be armed with a revolutionary theory.
In chapters one and two of What Is To Be Done? Lenin fights for a revolutionary theory in opposition to the views of the West European opportunists represented by Bernstein, who attempted to revise the prin­ ciples of Marxism, as well as in opposition to the Russian followers of Bernstein, the “legal Marxists” and the Economists.
Opportunist theories served the Economists as grounds for allowing themselves to become “absorbed in the narrowest forms of practical activity,” for bowing before “spontaneity.
” Lenin fought against this.
The Economists strove to reduce the level of Party consciousness “to the level of understanding of the backward strata of the masses.
” They wanted to transform the Party from being the leader, the vanguard of the working class, into the rearguard dragging at the tail of the move­ ment-That is why Lenin described the Economists as “khvostists” from the Russian word khvost which means tail.
Bowing to spontaneity, to the lack of class consciousness of the labour movement, led to the repudiation of the need for an independent proletarian theory and tactics.
This meant that the proletariat would be subordinated to bourgeois ideology and bourgeois politics.
That is why Lenin laid particular emphasis on the exceptional importance of Marxian theory as a means of converting the spontaneous labour movement in­ to a conscious socialist movement.
Without a revolutionary theory, saia Lenin, there can be no revolutionary practice, and he added, “the theoretical doctrine of Social-Democracy arose quite independently of 321 the spontaneous growth of the labour movement” and it “could only lx* brought'* in (into the movement) “from without.
” The opportunists at­ tacked Lenin for these statements and accused him of underestimating the importance of the spontaneous labour movement and of having a non­ Marxian conception of the origin of revolutionary theory.
But in mak­ ing these statements Lenin merely wished to emphasise the point that theory does not simply spring from the spontaneous labour movement, but is the result of a scientific study of the enormous and varied ex­ perience of the prolonged and stubborn struggles of the working class.
Since, in capitalist society, science is not accessible to the working class, especially in the first stages of its development, the ideas of scientific socialism were “brought to them from without” by intellectuals, who adopted the point of view of the proletarian class struggle.
In the initial stages of the labour movement, these intellectuals served as “revolutionary bacilli,** as a ferment, which accelerated the ferment in the ranks of the working class and helped the workers to understand their class in­ terests and the historic tasks of the proletariat as the fighter for social­ ism.
This does not imply that Lenin separated the socialist theory from the working class movement, or opposed one to the other.
On the con­ trary, he strongly emphasised the necessity for educating the workers* vanguard, the necessity for creating firm cadres of professional revolu­ tionaries from the ranks of the workers.
He merely strove to prove that without a vanguard party armed with a revolutionary theory, the mass of the workers would not be able to “train itself’ to understand scientific socialism, that socialist ideology does not rise spontaneously from the labour movement.
The same thing must be said in regard to “spontaneity” and “con­ sciousness.
** Lenin did not draw a hard and fast line between the two.
The organised strike movement of the ’nineties can be described as a “conscious” movement as compared with the riots and the smashing of machinery which occurred in the ’sixties and the ’seventies.
“This shows,” said Lenin, “that the spontaneous element, in essence, represents noth­ ing more nor less than consciousness in an embryonic form.
” “Con­ sciousness” is the appreciation of the class interests and historic tasks of the proletariat.
Beginnings of this class consciousness in various degrees occur at various stages of the mass movement, but it cannot occur in its developed form, in the form of a socialist ideology, without the aid of the “theoreticians,” without the aid of the “revolutionary bacilli.
” When the working class becomes mature enough to create its own party, this party determines the best tactics to adopt from the point of view of the class interests of the proletariat on the basis of a Marx­ ian analysis, and leads the masses of the workers on the basis of these tactics.
Subsequently, Plekhanov, Martov, Potresov, Axelrod and the other col­ leagues of Lenin on Iskra, after their transition to the side of opportun­ ism, abandoned the consistent revolutionary views of the old Iskra, and although they had previously praised What Is To Be Done? very highly, they began to find various “Leninist heresies” in it.
They tried to in­ terpret the postulates in What Is To Be Done? on spontaneity and con­ sciousness, and on an organisation of professional revolutionaries, to mean that Lenin was imposing upon the workers cadres of “guardians,** who would convert the proletariat into their “ward,” “restrict” its in­ dependence, strangle democracy and implant bureaucracy.
Before the Second Congress Plekhanov defended the fundamental postulates enun­ ciated in What Is To Be Done? against the Economists; but after the Second Congress he repeated the very things the Economists had said.
When What Is To Be Done? was republished in the symposium Twelve Years, Lenin made no material changes in it but merely stated in the in­ troduction to the symposium that What Is To Be Done? “controversially corrects Economism, and it would be wrong to study its contents outside of this task.
” Pace 27/ In June 1901 the representatives of five Social-Democratic groups working outside Russia met in Geneva with the object of discuss­ ing the formation of a single party.
The groups were: 1) The League of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad (Rabocheye Dyelo group); 2) The Sotsial Demokrat group (which included Plekhanov, Vera Zasulich, etc.
); 3) the Iskra group; 4) the Foreign Committee of the Bund, and 5) the Borba group (which included D.
Ryazanov, J.
Steklov and E.
Smirnov-Danevich).
A resolution was .
passed condemning Economism, Bemsteinism and Millerandism, i.
e.
, all forms of Russian and interna­ tional opportunism.
The Rabocheye Dyelo group subsequently withdrew its support of the June resolution and adopted a clearly opportunist position on this issue.
Pace 31.
* The struggle between two tendencies, to which Lenin refers, is the struggle between revolutionary and opportunist socialism, which was the prelude to the struggle now going on between the Communist International and the social-fascists of the Second International.
As early as 1908, Lenin foretold that this conflict of ideas would be trans­ formed into an armed conflict In 1902 when What Is To Be Done? was written, Lenin observed that the struggle between opportunism and rev­ olutionary Marxism has “grown from a national into an international” struggle.
In the second half of the nineteenth century, a struggle between two tendencies went on in the socialist movements in Germany, France, England and Russia, i.
e.
, between the revolutionary and proletarian ten­ dency on the one hand, and the reformist and petty-bourgeois tendency on the other; but that struggle did not yet bear an international character.
In Germany, in the ’sixties and the ’seventies, a struggle proceeded between the followers of Ferdinand Lassalle and the Eisenachers, i.
e.
, the German Marxists led by August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebknecht, who formed the Social-Democratic Party of Germany in the town of Eisenach in 1869.
The principal question that divided these two parties was the question of the unification of Germany.
“This unifi­ cation,” said Lenin, “could take place, with the relationship of classes prevailing at that time, in one of two ways: either by means of a rev­ olution led by the proletariat, which would <set up a united German republic, or by means of dynastic wars waged by Prussia, which would strengthen the hegemony of the Prussian landlords in united Germany.
Lassalle and his followers, failing to see much chance of a proletarian and democratic solution of the problem, pursued the tactics of adapt­ ing themselves to the hegemony of the Junkers, led by Bismarck.
The mistake they made was that they wanted to divert the labour movement to Bonapartist state socialist lines.
On the other hand, Bebel and Lieb­ knecht consistently fought for the democratic and proletarian solution and fought against the slightest concession to Prussianism, Bismarckism and nationalism.
” At the same time a struggle went on between the Lassalleans and Eisenachers on a number of other questions, but along the same lines, i.
e.
, the struggle between compromise with the ruling classes, in this case, the Prussian Junkers represented by the Bismarck government (the Lassalleans), and the tactics of the revolutionary class struggle (the Eisenachers).
But this struggle did not extend beyond the boundaries of Germany.
In France, in the beginning of the ’eighties, a struggle began be­ tween the followers of Jules Guesde, who were adherents of the teach­ ings of Marx, and the so-called Possibilists, the opportunists, who ad­ vised the workers to demand only that which was “possible” under the capitalist system.
The questions in dispute were: the question of central­ ism or federalism in Party organisation and the question as to whether Socialists could take part in bourgeois municipal governments.
Although these questions come within the category of programme and theoretical, as well as tactical, questions, nevertheless, these controversies did not assume an international character.
In England, in 1884, two organisations arose: one, consisting of Marx­ ists, although they were far from being consistent Marxists (Hyndman, 1'om Mann and others), called itself the Social-Democratic Federation, and the other, a sqcial-reformist and actually a bourgeois party, called itself the Fabian Society, after the Roman general Fabius Cunctator, renowned for his cautious, tactics.
The Fabian Society was founded by a group .
of writers and professors who, in opposition to revolutionary Marxistsv.
preached “municipal socialism'’ and the gradual, peaceful transition from capitalism .
to socialism by means of reforms carried through by the municipalities.
.
The Fabians were also advocates of British imperialism.
Owing to the fact that the British bourgeoisie was able to “bribe” the upper stratum of the British working class out of the extra profits it made from the exploitation of the colonies, the propaganda of the Fabian Society made considerable headway, whereas the Social-Democratic Federation remained an uninfluential body.
But the struggle between tendencies in the British socialist movement bore the traces of the special features of the British labour movement.
The struggle bet wren the Marxists and Narodnaya Volya in Rus­ sia also did not extend beyond the confines of the country, because at that time Narodnaya Volya and Narodism generally were a purely Russian phenomenon.
The end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries marked the opening of the epoch of the domination of finance capital in the advanced countries of Europe.
The younger capitalist countries began to overtake and surpass England, which hitherto had enjoyed a colonial monopoly and, as a consequence, had been able to create a large stratum of aristocrats of labour and what Lenin called “bourgeois labour politicians.
” Parallel with the growth of imperialism in other countries, favourable ground was created for the growth of opportunist ideas among the upper and better provided-for section of the working class.
Opportun­ ism became an international phenomenon.
Opportunism became the agent of international imperialism in the working class movement.
The fight be­ tween opportunism and revolutionary Marxism entered a new phase.
Lenin’s remark at the end of the passage here commented on: “in this first really international battle with .
.
.
opportunism” the revolu­ tionary wing of the International must become strengthened, and an end will be put “to the political reaction that has long reigned in Europe,” is profoundly interesting.
Lenin here points to the connection between the new phase into which the struggle between the two tendencies in the labour movement had entered and the changes in world economics which put an end to the peaceful epoch of development of capitalism.
This peaceful epoch commenced in 1871, after the suppression of the Paris Commune, and in Lenin’s opinion it came to an end in 1904, i.
e.
, the eve of the 1905 Revolution.
Pace 31.
** Bernstein, a German Social-Democrat who had displayed his opportunism as far back as the ’seventies, at the outset of his career.
In the middle of the ’nineties he started an undisguised campaign against the very foundations of revolutionary Marxism.
In a series of articles which subsequently appeared in book form under the title Problems ol Socialism, he attempted to demonstrate theoretically the desirability of collaboration between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and evolved a theory of the peaceful development of capitalism into socialism, thus denying the necessity and inevitability of the class struggle of the prole­ tariat and the necessity of the dictatorship of ♦ the latten Thus, Bernstein imd that collaboration was possible between the proletariat and the hour« geoisie.

* In the course of the Great French Revolution of 1789-94, two mutually hostile parties arose.
One was the party of the Gironde (named after the district of the Gironde), the other, the revolutionary party of the Jacobins (known also as the party of the Mountain, the Montagnards).
The Girondists represented the capitalists and the middle­ class bourgeois who demanded freedom based on private property, tried to avoid all sharp conflicts with the reactionary feudal elements and to find a common language with the ruling classes of foreign countries.
The Jacobins, who were the party of the revolutionary petty bourgeoisie, were supported by petty-bourgeois strata of the population (including the artisans) and the urban poor.
Far from being the champions of socialism, they consistently defended bourgeois property and were hostile to the Communists of the time.
But they fought with the utmost determination for the complete victory of the bourgeois-democratic revolution and for the preservation and consolidation of its conquests.
“The historians of the pro­ letariat,” Lenin wrote, “regard Jacobinism as one of the greatest upheav­ als of an oppressed class in its struggle for liberation.
The Jacobins gave France the best models of a democratic revolution repealing the coalition of monarchs against the republic.
” (Collected Works, Vol.
XX.
) When the revolution was jeopardised by the attack of the united forces of the feudal countries of Western Europe, when, at home, the counter-revolution­ ary nobility raised its head and the bourgeoisie, anxious to oust the Jacobins, entered into an agreement with the former, the Jacobins replied not only by organising a revolutionary war against the counter-revolution from without, but also by establishing a ruthless reign of terror directed against the aristocrats and against the bourgeoisie that had betrayed the revolution.
The terror was extended by the Jacobins to the Girondists, as a party of compromise with the counter-revolution.
When Plekhanov (who himself was very soon, after the Second Congress, to become the leader of the opportunist wing of the Russian Social-Democrats) during the strug­ gle against the Economists wrote, in an article entitled “On the Threshold of the Twentieth Century,” of the possibility of a Mountain and a Gironde in the working class movement, he was thinking of the struggle between the opportunists and the revolutionary wing of the Social Democrats.

Their object was to educate the students in a spirit of mon­ archism and of Russian imperial jingoism.
The textbook made no attempt to give a scientific interpretation of the facts of history.
Its standpoint was that history consists of the acts of kings and that kings are ap­ pointed by God.
An attitude to history from the Ilovaysky point of view is a superficial and unscientific attitude.

** In 1878 the Reichstag on a motion introduced by Bismarck passed an exceptional law against the Socialists, known as the Anti­ Socialist Law, which declared the Social-Democratic Party to be illegal and membership of it a punishable offence.
As long as this law remained in force the German Social-Democratic Party was compelled to go under­ ground.
While underground, however, it built up a well-disciplined Party organisation capable of carrying on work among the masses, and took ad­ vantage of all available legal opportunities.
The government did not sue-ceed in destroying the Party, and the latter*» influence on the working class grew enormously.
The Anti-Socialist Law was repealed (or rather the Reichstag refused to allow a further extension of it) in 1890.
The re­ peal of the law was an indication of the increased strength of the German proletariat wThich the ruling class was forced to reckon with.

* The “Socialists of the Chair” (German: Katheder-Sozialisten) were one of the varieties of bourgeois social reformism.
They were mainly professors of the German universities, whence their name.
Their conten­ tion was that class contradictions could be eliminated by means of social reforms and these must be carried out by the state, whose duty it was to restrict undue exploitation on the part of the capitalists and to im­ prove the position of the workers without any class struggle.
“Chair-socialism” was one of the attempts on the part of the bourgeoisie to “refute” the Marxian theory of the class struggle; it tried to subject the working class to the influence of the bourgeoisie by idealising the bour­ geois state as a force above classes which guards the interests of “justice” and defends the interests of the workers.

** In 1899 the Socialist Millerand joined the French bourgeois cabinet and put into practice the opportunist policy of collaboration with the bourgeoisie.
That policy was strongly condemned by Russian Zs£ra-ism with Lenin at its head, as well as by all the more or less consistent Marxian elements in the international Social-Democratic movement (e.
g.
, the Guesdists in France).
But the leading groups of the Second Inter­ national and of the German Social-Democratic Party, which adopted a con­ ciliatory, centrist position, condemned it in a very qualified way.
At the Paris Congress of the Second International in 1900, they supported Kautsky’s “elastic” resolution and got it passed, as against the resolution moved by Guesde.
In the ranks of the Right-wing opportunists, the policy of collaboration with the bourgeoisie and with its government, of course, found unqualified approval.
Millerand's entry into the cabinet was wel­ comed by Jaurès, the representative of the opportunist section of the French Socialists, by the German Bernsteinists, and also by Rabochcye Dyelo, in an article by Krichevsky, which is here referred to by Lenin.

**** At the Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party in Hanover in October 1899, the question of the revisionist position of Bern­ stein (who had just published a series of articles and brought out his book [see note to page 31**]) was specially discussed.
A resolution was passed which ended with the following: “The Party sees no reason for changing its main demands, its funda­ mental views, its tactics and its very name, i.
e.
, for turning the Social-Democratic Party into a democratic-socialist party of reform: the party emphatically reiects every attempt to obscure or change its attitude to­ wards the existing political and social order and towards the bourgeois parties.
” At the Liibeck Congress (September 1901) when the same question came up, the following resolution was passed, in answer to the opportun­ ists’ demand for “freedom of criticism”: “The Congress recognises the absolute need for self-criticism for the further spiritual development of our Party.
But the highly one-sided sort of criticism to which Comrade Bernstein has devoted himself during the past few years, while abstaining at the same time from all criticism of bourgeois society and of its representatives, has placed him in an am­ biguous position and has evoked the resentment of the majority of the comrades.
Hoping that Comrade Bernstein realises this and will change his behaviour accordingly, the Congress passes to the order of the day.
” This resolution was moved by Bebel whose attitude, as well as that of Kautsky, was of a' conciliatory centrist nature.
Although they condemned Bernsteinism, the recognised leaders of the German Social-Democratic Party fought it in an irresolute, hikewarm, “diplomatic” way, preferring ‘‘a bad peace” to “a good quarrel.
” This conciliatory attitude towards revi­ sionism contributed to the subsequent victory of the opportunists who, in the course of time, won control of the whole Party.

Potresov) in an article entitled “What Has Happened?” (Zarva, No.
I, April 1901, p.
42) wrote: “There" are in Russia so many disguised and so few open adherents of this doctrine [revisionism—Ed.
] that it is as though Bernsteinism were a secret disease which one does not openly avow when one has ;t.
” Pace 39.
* This refers to the “alliance” of the revolutionary Social-Demo­ crats and the “legal Marxists” (Struve, Bulgakov, Tugan-Baranovsky, etc,).
It was a temporary alliance with the object of fighting the Narodniki in the legal press.
Lenin was the first to expose the bourgeois nature of the “legal Marxists.
” those temporary fellow-travellers of the revolutionary Social-Democrats.
This he did in an article entitled “The Economic Con­ tent of Narodism and the Criticism Of It in Mr.
Struve’s Book.
” (See Selected Works, Volume I.
) The article was signed K.
Tulin.
It is this article that Lenin refers to in the footnote to the present passage inserted in the 1908 edition.
Lenin placed the word “alliance” in quotation marks thus emphasising that it could be called an alliance only very condi­ tionally.
Pace 41.
* The tsarist censorship placed no restrictions on the circulation of the writings of the revisionists.
In 1901 as many as three translations were brought out, in St.
Petersburg and Moscow, of the book in which Bernstein criticises the programme and tactical views of the revolutionary Social Democrats.
This tolerance was all the more significant in that at that time even the publications of the liberal bourgeoisie were persecuted by the government.
Lenin establishes a direct connection between this tolerance and the “Zubatovist” policy of the government; he points out that Zubatov, the notorious police agent, recommended Bernstein’s book to the workers as an “antidote” to the influence of the revolutionary Social-Democrats.
In referring to Bernstein as “celebrated in the Herostratus sense,” I^enin alludes to the ancient Greek story of a certain Herostratus who, wishing to nreserve his name in history, set fire to the famous Temple of Diana at Ephesus.
Pace 42.
* Vademecum (Guide) for the Editors of “Rabocheye Dyelo” was the title of a collection of documents relating to Economism, brought out by the Emancipation of Labour group in Geneva (1900).
The collection included: A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats (sec Selected Works, Volume I), Axelrod’s answer to the pamphlet.
A Contribution to the Ques­ tion of the Present Tasks and Tactics of the Russian SociaLDemocrais, and an announcement of the resumption of publication by the Emancipa­ tion of Labour group.
Besides this, two letters were reproduced which, though addressed to Axelrod personally, presented considerable public in­ terest since they showed the full measure of the opportunism of the writ­ ers, M.
M.
(E.
D.
Kuskova, author of the Credo) and G.
(the Bundist “Grishin”—Kopelson), and of “an Economist” (Prokopovich) mentioned by them who, according to the writers of the letter, “leaves positively no stone unturned” of the programme and tactical views of the Social-Dem­ ocrats.
These documents were preceded by a long introduction by Plekha: nov in which he explained the reason for the publication of the collection and criticised some of the assertions of the Rabocheye Dyelo group.
The collection of documents exposed the falsity of Economisai and its ideo­ logical identity with West European opportunism.
Lenin endorsed the position adapted by Plekhanov in Vademecum.
Pace 43.
* Two Congresses was the title under which the League of Rus-sion Social-Democrats Abroad issued its announcement of its Third Con­ gress, which was held in October 1901.
The object of this Congress was to unite all the organisations of Russian Social-Democrats abroad.
The attempt failed.
The Economists (Rabocheye Dyelo) refused to endorse the resolution passed at the preliminary conference in Geneva (June 1901) which explicitly condemned Economisai, Bernsteinism, Millerandism and all other forms of opportunism.
This led to the Iskra and Sotsial-Demokrat organisations withdrawing from the Congress.
The groups that withdrew made the proposal that a joint report of the Congress be issued.
But the Rabocheye Dyelo group refused, and issued an independent communiqué which contained many misrepresentations of the debates at the Congress.
The Iskra and Sotsial Demokrat organisa­ tions (which now united to form the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democrats) also brought out a pamphlet entitled Documents of the “Unity?* Congress (Geneva 1901) in which they exposed these misrepre­ sentations.
The preface to this pamphlet was written by Lenin.
(See Collected Works, Vol.
IV, Book II, p.
56.
) The Rabocheye Dyelo pamphlet, Two Congresses, is closely analysed in What Is To Be Done? Pace 46.
* The Announcement of the Resumption of Publication by the Emancipation of Labour Group, besides being included in Plekhanov’s Vademecum (see note to page 42*), appeared in pamphlet form (Gene­ va 1900).
It pointed out that one of the effects of the tremendous prac­ tical work carried on during the preceding years by the Social-Democrats had been to relegate theoretical work to the background.
This gap be­ tween theory and revolutionary practice had proved disastrous, for it had facilitated the rise of revisionist tendencies (Bernsteinism and Econom­ isai).
Against the background of a growing working class movement the group was resuming its literary activity, with the slogan of a relentless, theoretical fight against all anti-revolutionary elements in the Social-Democratic movement.
Unlike the Announcement, the other document mentioned by Lenin paid no attention to the importance of theory and adapted the demands of the Party to the leveff of the most backward strata of the working class.
Pace 47.
* The Gotha Programme was adopted at the United Congress of the Lassallean and Eisenach Parties in Gotha in May 1875.
In order to effect a union with the opportunist Lassallean wing, the Eisenachers, who on the whole were the revolutionary Marxian wing of the Congress, com­ promised with them on a number of points, and this found expression in the (programme.
Marx and Engels disagreed with the Lassallean passages in the draft programme and severely criticised the programme.
(Critique of the Gotha Programme,) The letters of Marx and Engels, which con­ tained this criticism, were sent to Bracke and communicated by the latter to Wilhelm Liebknecht, but Liebknecht withheld them from the Congress.
In 1891 the German Social-Democratic Party at its Congress in Halle decided to revise the Gotha Programme.
Engels at that time also published Marx’s Critique of the Gotha ^Programme.
In October of the same year, 1891, a congress of the German Social-Democratic Party which met tn Erfurt adopted a new programme, known as the Erfurt Programme, which was also criticised by Engels on account of the opportunist pass­ ages contained in it.
Pace 52.
* In May 1896 about 3,500 St.
Petersburg spinners and weavers went on strike.
As a result of this strike the workers succeeded in obtaining certain concessions from their employers as well as from the government On June 14 ( 2), 1897, a law was enacted limiting the work­ ing day for the whole of Russia to eleven and a half hours.
In spite of the insignificance of these gains (the law limiting the working day, for example, was evaded by overtime work), they bred illusions concerning the possibility of obtaining real improvements by means of purely indus­ trial action.
These illusions prepared the ground for the influence of Economism among the workers.
Pace 54.
* The pamphlet On Agitation met with success because it came out at a moment when the moment was ripe to pass from propaganda in study circle«, which could only train a small number of revolution* aries, to agitation among the working class masses.
But the pamphlet advanced the mistaken theory that the movement could not undertake political action before it had reached a definite stage of development.
This “stages theory” was formulated in the pamph­ let as follows: the proletariat will take the path of political action only when “the economic struggle will have made clear to it the impossibility of obtaining any improvement of its position in the existing political con­ ditions.
” The Economists advanced this “stages theory” (first only econ­ omic action, and only after that to pass to political action) in order to justify their tactics.
Lenin points out that attention had already been drawn to this in­ sufficiently clear formulation of the question at the time when the pamph­ let was being circulated in manuscript.
The pamphlet had been criticised by Axelrod who wrote a postscript to it, and it was submitted to a special critical analysis by Plekhanov (in his article “Once Again Social« ism and the Political Struggle**).
Pace 56.
* Listok Rabotnika (Workers' Sheet) was published by the League of Russian Social-Democrats and edited by the Emancipation of Labour group (Plekhanov, Axelrod and Zasulich).
When the League be­ gan to veer towards the opportunist attitude of the Economists, the Emancipation of Labour group refused to continue editing Listok Robot-nika.
Relations were broken off.
The League, however, was able to bring out one more issue of Listok (No.
9-10, 1898) which was edited in an Economist spirit The issue was the last to appear under that name.
After that the organ of the League was* published under the new name of Rabocheye Dyelo.
Listok Rabotnika, in its last number, No.
9-10, contained the “rules for a workers* benefit fund** which Lenin mentions.
The functions of such a fund were defined as follows: the fund assists strikers, obtains books for circulation, meets the expenses for renting a room for study circles, publishes a workers’ paper, and assists those who have suffered for the cause of the workers.
This is followed by instructions on how to organise funds at the factories (by groups of not more than five, who must elect a treasurer; the treasurers in every city must hold meetings at least three times a year).
Pace 64.
* The Hirsch-Duncker unions, the yellow trade unions of Ger­ many, thus called after their two founders Hirsch and Duncker, were a bourgeois stronghold within the working class movement.
Their object was to reduce the trade unions to the role of workers’ benefit societies.
A necessary condition of membership was the rejection of political action and of a number of other Social-Democratic demands.
Non-workers w’ere ad­ mitted as members.
With the aid of these organisations the German bour­ geoisie hoped to deflect the working class movement into the groove of bourgeois reformism.
But they never succeeded in building up a mass organisation.
The members of the Hirsch-Duncker unions never exceeded several tens of thousands, while that of the Social-Democratic unions ran into hundreds of thousands.
Pace 65.
* No.

9-10 of Listok Rabot­ nika.
(See note to page 56.
*) The paragraph Lenin has in view runs as follows: “The principal object of the fund is to help the workers unite in one common union to fight against the capitalist enuployers and the government that protects their interests.
” Pace 70.
* In 1871, after the victorious war with France and the annexa­ tion of Alsace-Lorraine, the unity of Germany was brought about by the in­ elusion of the states of Southern Germany in the North German Union, which was formed in 1867 after the war with Austria.
Germany was pro­ claimed an empire and the King of Prussia—German Emperor.
The Reich­ stag became the parliament for the whole empire.
Pace 80.
* The reference is to the following passage in the resolution of the Fourth Congress of the Bund: “The economic struggle is a better method for drawing the masses into the movement; it should become the starting point for political agitation, which must go beyond the boundary of the economic struggle.
But it is quite unnecessary, at the very begin­ ning, to carry on political agitation exclusively on the basis of the economic struggle.
” A communiqué concerning the Congress appeared in pamphlet form under the title, The Fourth Congress of the Jewish Labour League in Lithuania, Poland and Russia (Geneva 1901), and it was also reprinted in No.
10 of Rabocheye Dyelo.
Pace 95.
* In his article “The Autocracy and the Proletariat,” Lenin de­ scribed the attitude of the liberal bourgeoisie to terrorism, and spoke of its sympathetic response to the terrorist attempts.
“The wave of liberal­ ism,’* he wrote, “rises and falls in close connection with the moods of the various Ministers, whose succession is accelerated by bombs.
It is not surprising, therefore, that our radical (or would-be radical) members of the bourgeois opposition should so often show sympathy for terrorism.
It is not surprising that it is the section of the revolutionary intelli­ gentsia which has no faith in the vitality and strength of the proletariat and of the proletarian class struggle that is particularly drawn towards terror.
** Page 95.
** The Revolutionary Socialist group Svoboda (Freedom) was formed in May 1901, with L.
Nadezhdin as its leader.
Its programme was muddled and lacked consistency.
While recognising the need for the political struggle of the working class, they advocated “excitative” terror­ ism, that is to say, a terrorism which would help to rouse the working masses to political action.
Of the two tendencies in the St.
Petersburg Social-Democratic organisation they supported the Economists.
The distinc­ tive feature of the group wras that its programme was patched up out of detached propositions of the programmes of the Economists, of the So­ cialist-Revolutionaries and, to a certain extent, of the revolutionary Social-Democrats.
Of course, no good could come of such a hodge podge.
The group broke up in 1903.
A little later Lenin wrote of the group: “For programme—double book­ keeping; for tactics—double book-keeping; for practical work—demagogy; such is the portrait of the Revolutionary Socialist group Svoboda.
” Of the publications of the group which Lenin mentions and criticises we may mention the review Svoboda and two pamphlets, The Regenera­ tion of Revolutionism in Russia and The Eve of the Revolution, Page 95.
*** In this work Axelrod outlined two prospects.
First prospect: “The working class movement remains confined to a nar­ row groove of purely economic conflicts between the workers and their employers; as such, on the whole, it lacks a political character.
In the fight for political liberty the advanced sections of the proletariat follow the lead of the bourgeois intelligentsia; they fight for freedom, but under a flag that is not their own.
” Second prospect: “The Social-Democrats organise the Russian prole­ tariat into an independent political party, which fights for freedom, partly side by side and in alliance with bourgeois revolutionary groups (if they exist), but partly drawing directly into their own ranks, or giving the lead to, those elements of the intelligentsia that are most devoted to the people and most revolutionary.
It is clear that the latter prospect will demand a much higher level of political and class con­ sciousness on the part of the workers than the former, for the former would allow the representatives of the bourgeoisie to be the leaders of the revolutionary movement and reduce the proletariat to the position of a mass led by them and blindly following them.

* The articles from Iskra which Lenin refers to are the following: “The Workers’ Party and the Peasantry,” by Lenin in Iskra, No.

“The Autocracy and the Zemstvo,” in Iskra, No.
4, on the irreconcil­ ability between the local government bodies and the autocracy.
This article was written by Peter Stiuve before the Social-Democrats had final­ ly broken with him.
It dealt with the secret memorandum on the Zemstvo drawn up by the tsarist minister, Witte.
Lenin deals with this memoran­ dum in his article “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism” (reprinted in part in the present volume; sec also note to page 205*).
“The Serfowners at Work,” by Lenin, in Iskra, No.
8 (Collected Works, Vol.
IV, Book I, p.
176), against the feudal landownership of the nobility, was written on the occasion of the promulgation of the law of June 21 (8), 1901, authorising the transfer of state lands in Siberia to private persons.
The law was a new gift granted by tsarism to the serfowning nobility.
“The Zemstvo Congress,” an item written by Lenin in the same issue.
It deals with the illegal Zemstvo Congress and calls on the Zemstvo people to begin a resolute fight against tsarism.
“Concerning Recent Events,” by Vera Zasulich, Iskra, No.
3, in response to the student disturbances of February-March 1901.
When the government paper Rossiya (Russia) advised the young people (students) to get rid of the influence of the extremist parties, affirming that the government was prepared, without waiting for a struggle, to advance along the road of reforms, Iskra (in No.

” The same issue contains the item mentioned by Lenin, entitled “A Police Raid on Literature”; the writer is unknown.
No.

The article is by Lenin, (See “A Valuable Admis­ sion,” Collected Works, Vol.

) The item, “The Incident in the Ekaterinoslav Zemstvo” (No.
7, un­ signed), encouraged the protest of the Zemstvo statisticians.
The item, “The Vyatka Scabs” (No.

* Professor Brentano, while recognising the existence of the class struggle, tried to interpret it in a way that would be favourable to the bourgeoisie.
He maintained that there w’as no need for the working class to fight for its dictatorship, since even under capitalism it could obtain the satisfaction of its demands with the aid of the state (which according to Brentano is not the instrument of class domination and oppression).
A policy of gradual reforms and economic collaboration of the classes— such was his theory; today the social-traitors have made it theirs.
It is in this sense that Lenin speaks of the Brentano (i.
e.
, bourgeois) concep­ tion of the class struggle.

* The League of Russian Social-Democrats commissioned the edi­ tors of Rabocheye Dyelo to draw up a report on the state of the Social-Democratic movement in Russia for presentation to the Congress of the Second International.
The report (to which was appended a memorandum of the Bund on the history of the Jewish working class movement) ap­ peared in pamphlet form under the title, Report on the Russian Social-Democratic Movement to the International Socialist Congress in Paris, 1900 (Geneva 1901).

* Rabochaya Gazeta was founded by a group of Social-Democrats in Kiev.
Two issues of it appeared in 1897.
At the first Congress of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, Rabochaya Gazeta was recognised as the central organ of the Party.
The arrests that followed prevented the publication of issue No.
3 which was ready for the press.
In pointing out that the founders of Iskra began to publish the latter and did not continue the publication of Rabochaya Gazeta (although negotiations concerning the editing of the latter had been carried on be­ tween the Bund and Lenin, who had agreed to do this and had even written several leading articles), Lenin wanted to emphasise the fact that the editors of Iskra had no intention of dominating the Party, which the Economists accused them of wanting to do.
Pace 193.
* The Socialist-Revolutionary Party was formed in 1901 as a re­ sult of the amalgamation of a number of revolutionary Narodnik groups which were active in various parts of Russia and abroad.
The official or­ gan of the party “on questions of current affairs” was Revolyutsionnaya Rossyia, edited by M.
Gotz and V.
Chernov, and its theoretical organ was Vestnik Russkoy Revolyutsii (Messenger of the Russian Revolution), edited by K.
Tarasov and N.
Russanov.
The theoretical views of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party comprised a combination of the views of the old Narodniki and the revisionist distortions of Marxism.
Being unable to oppose Marxism by any sort of complete theoretical doctrine, the So­ cialist-Revolutionaries, like the revisionists in Western Europe, tried to “revise” the fundamental points of the Marxian theory.
In place of the Marxian theory of the class struggle, the Socialist-Revolutionaries advanced their own theory, viz.
, the struggle of all the exploited, i.
e.
, the workers, peasants and the working intelligentsia, against the exploiters, i.
e.
, the capitalists and landlords.
This theory obviously ob­ scures the distinction between the proletariat and the petty-bourgeois peasants and denies the class struggle in the rural districts.
A characteristic feature of the Socialist-Revolutionary programme was the demand for the socialisation of the land, “the organisation of equal land tenure for the peasants on the basis of enlarged social ownership of land/’ This, in the opinion of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, would lead to the victory of socialism; and the best way to secure victory over capi­ talism, in their opinion, was to organise “socialised” agricultural co­ operative societies under the capitalist system.
By glossing over the process of capitalist development in the rural districts and ignoring the class differentiation that was taking place among the peasantry, the Socialist-Revolutionaries sowed the illusion that the impending revolution, the bourgeois-democratic character of which they failed to understand, would result in the emancipation of the peasantry from all the exploitation to which they were subjected, including the exploitation of capitalism.
In regard to tactics, the Socialist-Revolutionaries attached supreme im­ portance to individual terrorism.
This blinded them to all other forms of revolutionary struggle and absorbed most of their efforts and attention in the course of their practical work.
In its ideology, tactics and membership, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party was a typical party of petty-bourgeois democrats, which was all the more harmful because its petty-bourgeois character was concealed by the flag of socialism and because in its work it opposed the efforts of the Social-Democrats to organise the workers in an independent political workers’ party.
The article—really an outline—‘"Why the Social-Democrats Must De­ clare Determined and Relentless War On the Socialist-Revolutionaries,” and die one following it, “Vulgar Socialism and Narodism Revived by the Socialist-Revolutionaries,” are the first articles Lenin wrote in oppo­ sition to the Socialist-Revolutionaries.
He attached enormous importance to the struggle against the Socialist-Revolutionary Party because of the ’’Leftism” it displayed in words and the opportunism it displayed in its actions.
Subsequently, in 1920, in his pamphlet “Left-JFing” Communism, an infantile Disorder, in reviewing the struggle which the Bolsheviks waged against the enemies in the labour movement, a struggle which helped Bolshevism to grow and become hardened, Lenin emphasises the importance of the fact that the traditions of the ruthless struggle against petty-bourgeois, semi-anarchist revolutionaries go back to the period of 1900 03, to the time when the foundations of the mass party, of the rev­ olutionary party of the proletariat, were laid.
“Bolshevism,” he said, “adopted and continued the struggle against the party which, more than any other, expressed the tendencies of petty-bourgeois revolutionariness, namely, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party.
” Page 205.
* The secret memorandum The Autocracy and the Zemstvo, by S.
Y.
Witte, the Minister of Finance, was published abroad (in Ger­ many) in 1901.
In thia memorandum addressed to the tsar, Witte dwelt in detail on the history and the role of the Zemstvo.
He argued that the latter was “not compatible with an autocratic system of government,” 33’ that it was by nature a fundamental appurtenance of a constitutional political order and that the further development of Zemstvo local govern« ment would only reinforce the desire of “society” for a constitutional transformation of the autocracy.
Witte advised against any further ex­ tension of Zemstvo institutions and was in favour of strengthening and improving the government’s bureaucratic machine in the provinces, since in his opinion the existing machine was not sufficiently [powerful, reliable or active.
The memorandum, which forms a book, of 212 pages, was pub­ lished abroad with an extensive preface by R.
N.
S.
(P.
B.
Struve).
The preface, written from a liberal standpoint, showed that Struve had com­ pletely broken with Marxism and had finally become a liberal who un­ conditionally rejected the revolutionary struggle against tsarism.
In the article entitled “The Persecutors of the Zemstvo and the Hannibals of Liberalism” (first appeared in Zarya, No.
2-3, 1901), Lenin analysed Witte’s memorandum and Struve's preface to it.
The article contained six chapters.
In the first four Lenin analyses the memorandum and dwells in detail on the real nature of the Zemstvo.
He ipoints out that the Zem­ stvo reform was the concession which Alexander IPs government was forced to make under the pressure of “the public unrest and the rev­ olutionary offensive” of the ’sixties.
But on the other hand the concession was contrived in such a way that it did nothing to limit the omnipotence and irresponsibility of the tsarist bureaucracy.
Having bribed and pacified the majority of the moderate liberals by means of insignificant reforms, the government came down with all the more ruthless cruelty on those revolu­ tionary-democratic elements which were not to be satisfied by miserable reforms, and were not only capable of talking of freedom but were cap­ able of fighting for it.
Subsequently the government proceeded gradually to take back, one after another, the concessions it had made.
The Zem­ stvo liberals repeatedly tried to protest against the reactionary policy of tsarism, but as they dreaded revolution and drastic methods of etrug-gle above all things they hoped to obtain this end by none but “peaceful means,” thus revealing their utter political impotence.
Instead of sup­ porting the revolutionary wing of the opposition they only complained and moaned when the government began to increase police oppression and re­ action.
Like the other reforms of the ’sixties, the Zemstvo reform, far from being incompatible with the autocratic order, actually strengthened the latter by splitting the opposition and facilitating an entente between tsarism and a section of the liberals who were on the whole satisfied with the reform.
The last two chapters of Lenin's article are devoted to the analysis of the preface by R.
N.
S.
(Struve) and to an appraisal, in the person of the latter, of the bourgeois liberalism of the time.
Owing to lack of space only these two chapters are reproduced in the present volume, as present­ ing the greatest interest.
As soon as it was written, in 1901, Lenins article became the occasion for dissensions among the editors of Zarya; Plekhanov, for example, strongly disapproved of the tone of the article.
He wrote to Lenin: “We must not abuse the liberals as such.
This would be tactless; we must ap­ peal from the bad liberal to the good liberal.
.
, .
Our attitude to the liberals must be as to eventual allies, but your tone, it must be confessed, is far from that of an ally.
.
.
.
You talk like an enemy, when we ought to be talking like allies.
.
.
.
At the present moment we must not stroke the liberals the wrong way, that would be a great mistake.
” Pace 206.
* As soon as it became evident that the revolutionary outbreaks of the peasants (in the ’sixties) had subsided, the government began tak­ ing back, step by step, the concessions it had made at the time of the so-called “great reforms,” i.
e.
, the emancipation of the serfs.
This began under Alexander II, but after the accession of Alexander III (1881) the reaction w’as further aggravated.
Zemsky Nachalniks were introduced in the rural districts and the peasants were placed under their unlimited authority; corporal punishment was partly restored for the peasants; the rights of the Zemstvo were greatly curtailed; municipal self-government, which had always been of the most wretched description, was reduced to practically nothing; the courts were reorganised in such a way as to increase bureaucratic irresponsibility.
It is this policy that Lenin describes as the “wicked revision” of the reforms of Alexander II under Alexander HI.
Pace 208.
* On March 13 (1), 1881, Alexander II was assassinated by the members of Narodnaya Volya.
A few days later, on March 22 (10), 1881, the Executive Committee of Narodnaya Volya addressed an open letter to Alexander III offering him terms the acceptance of which was “necessary if peaceful work is to take the place of the revolutionary movement.
” The terms were: a general amnesty to all political offenders; the con­ vening of an assembly of representatives of the people without distinction of class or “estate”; freedom of the press, of speech, of meetings, etc.
On these terms the Executive Committee undertook to discontinue its act­ ivities and to divert the forces it had organised for revolutionary action to peaceful work.

* On the withdrawal of the liberal nobility and bourgeoisie from the opposition in the ’sixties, sec note to page 205.
* The revolutionary movement began to gather force in the ’seventies, this time mainly among the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia of the towns and the factory’ workers.
This found expression in a considerable growth of the revolutionary organisations and in their increased activity (for ex­ ample, Narodnaya Volya).
There were also signs of growing discontent among the liberal sections of the nobility and bourgeoisie.
Some of the Zemstvo liberals displayed constitutional tendencies, and attempts were even made to form illegal unions and start an underground ipress.
But these attempts only revealed the complete political impotence of the Zemstvo liberals.
They were by no means disinclined to make use of the revolutionary movement when it could be used to frighten the autocracy.
But as soon as the government made a few concessions to the liberals by replacing the more reactionary Ministers and making vague and noncom­ mittal promises, the attitude of the liberals towards the “destructive activ­ ity of the extreme revolutionary party” became exceedingly hostile.
By means of this policy of promises and deceit the government was able again to draw the moderate liberals to its side.
After the assassination of Alex­ ander II at the hands of Narodnaya Volya, the liberals definitely adopted the policy of coming to an agreement with the government.
Alexander IH*s government “did not show its claws at once, but thought it ex­ pedient for a time to try to fool ‘society*” (Lenin).
By means of demagogic promises which it never intended to keep, it fostered the hope among the liberals of obtaining the desired reforms by peaceful means.
Only when it became evident that a mass revolutionary outbreak in the near future was impossible did the government launch an undisguised counter-offensive.

* Lenin refers to the views of Rabochaya Mysl on the objects of political action.
While not denying the necessity for .
political action on the part of the proletariat, Rabochaya Mysl used the term, not to denote revolutionary struggle leading to the overthrow of tsarism, but a struggle for gradual reforms under tsarism.
In this way Rabochaya Mysl reduced Social-Democratic tactics to the level of the political prejudices of the backward workers who hoped to obtain some improvement of their posi­ tion without abolishing the autocracy, (See notes to pages 4* and 25.

) Marx emphasises that the significance of that revolution did not lie in the immediate and insignificant gains it could have achieved, but in the fact that by shatter­ ing the illusions and prejudices that prevailed before the revolution it helped to forge a genuinely revolutionary party.

* As soon as the tactical and organisational achievements of Iskra became evident, the editors set to work to draw up a programme.
In the discussion of this question serious dissensions arose among the editors.
Two drafts were submitted, one by Plekhanov and one by Lenin.
Lenin reproached Plekhanov for having drawn up a “syllabus for students” instead of the programme of a fighting party that had declared war on Russian capitalism.
Besides accusing Plekhanov of talking of capit­ alism in the abstract, and not of Russian capitalism, Lenin pointed out a number of other grave mistakes committed by Plekhanov.
In partic­ ular, Lenin pointed out that Plekhanov had incorrectly presented the mutual relations between the proletariat and the peasantry in the ad­ vance towards the socialist revolution, that he had failed to bring out the role of the proletariat as the only class that is consistently revo­ lutionary to the end, and that he had not “singled out” the proletariat from the whole mass of the working and exploited classes.
Lenin also insisted on inserting a paragraph on the dictatorship of the proletariat, which was deleted by Plekhanov in his second draft In Iskra, Lenin’s draft programme was accompanied by the following edi­ torial note: ‘‘The theoretical part of this draft is a draft proposed by one of the editors, Frey [i.
e.
, Lenin—Ed.
] (and is drawn up on the basis of the original draft by G.
V.
Plekhanov).
The practical part (from the point indicated below to the end) is proposed by the whole com­ mittee, i.
e.
, by the five editors.
” Clause C had also been adopted by the whole committee.
The dispute between Lenin and Plekhanov soon passed from general questions of the programme to questions connected with the agrarian programme.
(See “The Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy” in this volume and also note to page 318.

* “The Workers’ Party and the Peasantry” was written in 1901, i.
e.
, shortly before the revival of the peasant movement which rose to an unprecedented height in 1902, especially in the South of Russia.
The ex­ tent of the rise of the peasant movement of that year can be judged from the following figures: the number of peasant outbreaks was 48 in 1900, 50 in 1901 and 340 in 1902.
The wave of peasant outbreaks swept over a number of districts, but it was particularly high in the South (Kharkov and Poltava Gubernias) and in the Saratov Gubernia.
Besides such general factors as the prevalence of feudal exploitation (otrabotki), the growth of capitalist exploitation, the aggravation of the class strug­ gle in the countryside, the influence of the working class movement in the towns, etc.
, there were also special causes for this, including a bad harvest, which made the position of the peasants, bad as it was, still worse.
These peasant outbreaks revealed the presence of considerable rev­ olutionary excitement among the peasants.
They showed that the country was on the verge of revolution, that the central issue of the latter would be the land question, and that the peasants would take part in this rev­ olution as a revolutionary force.
The party of the (proletariat was con­ fronted with the problem of determining its attitude to the agrarian and peasant question and with the problem of the relation of the proletariat to the peasantry and to the various strata of the latter.
‘‘The Workers* Party and the Peasantry’* by Lenin was the first article to appear in Iskra where the main problems of the agrarian programme and of the tactics of the proletarian party in respect of the peasants were set out with exhaustive clarity.
That the article was actually in­ tended as the outline of a programme is confirmed by the following words of Lenin; “In one of its first issues (March 1901, No.
3) Iskra gave the outline of an agrarian programme: in an article, “The Workers* Party and the Peasantry,** it defined its view of the basic principles of a Russian Social-Democratic agrarian policy.
The article may be regarded as the first draft of the agrarian programme of the R.

IX.
) Lenin’s attitude towards the agrarian and peasant question is formulated in many of his writings.
The following idea is the foundation of all Lenin’s writings on questions of agrarian policy and of the agrarian programme: “We recognise the class struggle as the central fact in the domain of agrarian relations in Russia.
We base the whole of our agrarian policy (and, consequently, our agrarian programme) on an un­ swerving recognition of this fact along with all the consequences result­ ing from it.
But the principal immediate object is to clear the road for the free development of the class struggle in the countryside, of the class struggle of the proletariat, directed towrards the achievement of the final aim of international Social-Democracy, the conquest of polit­ ical power by the proletariat and the laying of the foundations of a socialist society.
” {Collected Works, Russian ed.
, Vol.
V.
) Lenin’s Marxian approach to the study of rural Russia enabled him to establish the presence of two types of class contradictions: on the one hand, the contradiction arising from the capitalist development of the rural districts, i.
e,, the contradiction between the agricultural labour­ ers and the entrepreneurs; on the other hand, the contradiction between the peasantry as a whole and the landlord class.
The immediate task, ac­ cording to Lenin, was the struggle against the survivals of serfdom, and in this struggle the peasantry should take (part as a wdwle, as a class.
Lenin considered the abolition of feudal relations in the rural districts to be part of the bourgeois-democratic revolution, i.
e.
, the abolition of the autocracy, the abolition of the domination of the class of big land­ lords.
The social-economic nature of this revolution would be bourgeois-democratic, for it would not abolish capitalism and capitalist exploita­ tion, but would abolish only that which hindered the development of capitalism, that which hindered the development of the class struggle of the proletariat.
Pace 235.
* The reference is to the defeat of Russia in the Crimean War of 1853-56.
Tliis war was the outcome of the efforts of Nicholas I’s gov­ ernment, acting in the interests of the landlords and the bourgeoisie (mainly commercial), to seize the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles with a view to safeguarding Russia’s foreign trade and, primarily, her grain exports.
With this object, the Russian army and navy attacked Turkey in 1853.
But a victory of tsarist Russia was not in the interests of the bourgeoisie of England, France and Austria, so tsarism found itself at war with other countries besides Turkey.
The English and the French landed an army in the Crimea and after a siege of eleven months took the Russian key fortress of Sevastopol.
The Russian Black Sea Fleet was sunk.
By the Peace of Paris (1856) Russia lost the right to keep a fleet in the Black Sea.
In 1871 tsarist diplomacy obtained the withdrawal of this prohibition.
Pace 235.
** The indignation of the peasants on the eve of the Reform of 1861, i.
e.
, the emancipation of the serfs, grew rapidly.
If we trace the growth of peasant disturbances by decades we see that the number of such disturbances in 1826-34 was 148, in 1835-44—216, in 1845-54— 348.
Between 1835 and 1855, 144 landlords were killed.
The number of disturbances in the five years preceding the Reform, i.
e.
, from 1855 to March 3 (February 19), 1861, was 474.
These figures show that it was on the very eve of the Manifesto of 1861, which proclaimed the so-called emancipation of the serfs, that the peasant movement assumed particularly large dimensions.
At times the disturbances assumed a very serious character and had to be suppressed with the aid of troops.
The following passage from a report of the Chief of the Corps of Gendarmes, in 1858, is significant in this respect: “The disorders that are of most frequent occurrence at present consist of the serfs either evading the payment of quit rent and other dues or showing disobedience towards the headsmen or towards the owners them­ selves.
Disturbances of entire villages demanding the personal inter­ vention of the highest provincial authorities or the aid of military detachments have occurred in cases where the landlords do not comply in their orders with the present spirit of the times, or where there have been instigators.
Events of this» kind, more or less important, have taken place in the course of the year in twenty-five provinces.
” The countryside was literally seething and this wfas what forced the government to make haste with the Reform.
Page 235.
*** The statutory charter was a document defining the mutual relations between the landlords and the peasants.
The landlord had to draw it up in the course of a year from the date of the Act of March 3 (February 19), 1861.
If the landlord failed to do so within this time it was drawn up by the Arbitrator, i.
e.
, an official appointed to super­ vise the carrying out of the “emancipation.
” He was usually a mem­ ber of the local nobility.
The statutory charter had to indicate the amount of land held by the peasants, the changes that would be made in the peasants* landholdings, the payments, dues, etc.
In reality, the statutory charters were documents giving legal form to the spoliation of the peasants, and it is, therefore, not strange that the first foui months after the Manifesto saw 647 peasant disturbances, i.
e.
, more than during the whole of the preceding decade; or that in the course of the two years during which the Reform was being carried out (1861-63), troops had to be called out in 2,115 villages to force the peasants to sign the charters.
In Bezdna, in the Kazan Gubernia, a pitched battle took place, in the course of which 51 were killed and 40 severely wounded.
Anton Petrov, the peasant leader, was sentenced to be shot.
It was said at the time: “There were never so many floggings as after ‘freedom’ was proclaimed.
” Page 235.
**** The Manifesto of March 3 (February 19), 1861, which proclaimed the so-called emancipation of the serfs, was written by Philaret, Metropolitan (Archbishop—Ed.
Eng.
ed.
) of Moscow.
The wording was exceptionally hypocritical; it wound up with an invitation to the peas­ ants to ask the “blessing of God” for their “free labour.
” Only an ex­ treme hypocrite (a Jesuit, as Lenin puts it) could talk of the “free labour” of the peasants who had been robbed by this “emancipation” and thus delivered into a new form of bondage to the landlords.
Page 236.
* In addition to the annuities, the peasants had to pay for the land they received at the time of the “emancipation”; numerous taxes were heaped upon them, such as: Zemstvo rates, the poll tax, insurance, taxes in-kind, etc.
, etc.
The result was that the burden of payments that lay on a peasant’s holding, expressed in percentage of the money income, amounted in the Tver Gubernia to 252 per cent, in Smolensk to 220, in Kostroma to 240, in Pskov to 213, in Vladimir to 276, and in Vyatka to 200 per cent (the figures refer to the ’eighties).
It is easy to see why a peasant with a “beggar’s holding” which committed him to onerous pay­ ments found it more advantageous to run away from his holding and even to pay to get rid of it.
While thus squeezing the very life blood out of the peasants, the government showed great care and attention in protecting the interests of the landlords.
Thus, for instance, in the Yegorevsk Uyezd, the taxes paid by a landlord of the nobility owning 253 dessiatins were equal to those of a peasant with a holding of 9.
4 dessiatins.

* The pamphlet To the Rural Poor was written and published abroad in 1903.
The pamphlet sets out, in a particularly clear and pop­ ular form, the basic ideas that became the foundation of the agrarian programme afterward® adopted by the Second Congress of the R.

In a letter to Plekhanov (March 28 [151, 1903) Lenin wrote as follows on the plan of his work: “I have started to write a popular pamphlet for the peasants dealing with our agrarian problem.
I am very anxious to explain our conception of the class struggle in the countryside on the concrete material available concerning the four strata of the rural population (the landlords, the peasant bourgeoisie, the middle peas­ ants and the semi-proletarians together with the proletarians).
** On April 27 (14), 1903, Martov wrote to Axelrod: “Vladimir Ilyich has written what we believe to be an excellent little book, To the Rural Poor, with the object of popularising our programme among the peas­ ants.
It may create as great an impression as IP hat Is To Be Done?" (Letters of P.
B.
Axelrod and J.
0.
Martov, Berlin, 1904.
) And indeed, the revolutionary significance of this work of Lenin’s was very great, for it gave not only an exhaustive analysis of the class struggle in the countryside but also of the Party’s tactics as regards the peasantry as a whole and of its various strata.
Pace 248.
* The State Council was an advisory body consisting of higher officials appointed by the tsar.
Under the influence of the Revolution of 1905, after the State Duma or parliament had been established, the State Council was transformed into an Upper Chamber, the func­ tion of which was to consider and to sanction laws that had already been passed by the Duma.
The new State Council consisted of 100 members appointed by the tsar and 100 elected by various groups of the ruling classes: by assemblies of the landowners, provincial assem­ blies of the Zemstvo, by the nobility, the clergy of the Orthodox Church, the big bourgeoisie and higher bourgeois intelligentsia.
The president and vice-president were appointed by the tsar.
Thus composed, the Coun­ cil of State could be relied upon to kill even the most moderate deci­ sions of the Duma if for some reason or other the ruling tsarist clique did not like them.
Page 248.
** Lenin attached great value to the political liberties enjoyed in European countries from the standpoint of the struggle of the pro­ letariat.
In comparing the parliamentary system with the tsarist regime in Russia he always emphasised the complete lack of rights, the absence of even a shadow of political liberty and the lack of opportunity prop­ erly to organise the workers for the struggle against the bourgeoisie that prevailed in tsarist Russia.
Compared with such a regime, he re­ peatedly emphasised, bourgeois demociacy, the parliamentary system, was a much higher system and held out very many advantages for the future struggle.
That is why he regarded the tsarist autocracy as the principal enemy in that period, when the bourgeois-democratic revolution was maturing.
But at the same time Lenin warned the workers and peasants that “political liberty will not deliver the working people from poverty .
.
.
but it will give the workers a weapon with which to fight poverty,” i.
e.
, fight for the socialist revolution.
Of course Lenin under­ stood perfectly well the class character of even the “freest [bourgeois] country.
” “The most democratic bourgeois republic,” says Lenin, “is nothing more nor less than a machine with which the bourgeoisie op­ presses the working class, with which a handful of capitalists oppresses the masses of the toilers.
” Page 263.
* The Peasants’ Land Bank was founded in 1882.
Its original purpose was to accelerate, in the interests of the impoverished landlords, the payment by the peasants of the compensation sums for the land assigned to the latter at the time of the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and, in genera], to help the landlords to sell land for which they had no fur­ ther use to the peasants at a high price.
With this object, the bank was entitled to extend credits to the peasants.
The real object of the bank, which was to give financial aid to the 'landowners at the expense of the peasants, was disguised in the original plan drawn up by the Minister of Finance Bunge by philanthropic phrases about assisting peasants with insufficient holdings to purchase land through the bank.
But even these hypocritical philanthropic phrases appeared dangerous to the ruling class.
In the course of the discussion of the draft in the State Council it was explicitly pointed out that a promise (the mere prom­ ise) of assistance might raise “unfounded hopes” among the poorer peas­ ants and might be interpreted as a step towards the transfer of the land from the landlords to the peasants.
As a result, the Articles of Associa­ tion of the Peasants' Bank stated that the object of the bank was not to give assistance to the landless peasants, but “to provide facilities for peas­ ants of every description to purchase land in such cases where the owners of the latter desire to sell and the peasants desire to buy such land.
” In reality, the Peasants’ Bank became a mere instrument of the land­ lord policy of tsarism.
The price of land when purchased through the bank was considerably higher than when bought directly from the owners; thus, in 1883, the average price of land bought through the bank was 52 rubles, the price of land bought by private contract wu3 27 to 28 rubles; in 1895, the prices were 52 rubles and 42 rubles, respectively.
When agriculture was undergoing a crisis and the price of land was falling, thus affecting the interests of the landlords, the Peasants’ Bank hastened to their rescue by buying great tracts of land at a higher price to re-sell to the peasants at a correspondingly high price, sometimes attracting the latter by deferred payments.
When the serfs were emancipated in 1861 the landlords cut off the best parts of the peasants’ holdings and kept them for themselves.
Very often these “cut­ off” lands, or otrezki as they were called, cut across the peasants’ hold­ ings and thus interfered with the propetf working of the holding, for the peasants were heavily fined if they trespassed on the landlords' land.
Hedged in on all sides by these otrezki the peasants were anxious to buy them out at any price; this only resulted in a new kind of bondage, for it made them the debt-slaves of the bank.
The interest on the advances made by the bank to the peasants was higher than in other banks; thus, in 1894, the rate of interest on ad­ vances was 4.
5 per cent in the Nobles’ Bank and 6.
5 per cent in the Peasants* Bank.
The well-to-do peasants were placed in better conditions than the poor peasants.
In 1883, money was advanced to prospective buyers up to the amount of nine-tenths of the price of the land pur­ chased and so the peasant had to pay a deposit of only one-tenth of the total price; but by 1895 the deposit had been raised to one-third of the total price.
Only the more well-to-do peasants could have such an amount of money at their disposal.
All this—high prices and a high rate of interest—combined to pauperise the peasants still further.
The arrears grew; the land was put up for sale to pay the arrears.
It was again the poorer peasants who suffered most.
Thus the proportion of land purchased through the bank that was forfeited for non-payment was 12.
9 per cent in the case of land bought by rural communes, but only 1.
4 per cent in the case of land bought by individual households, i.
e.
, by the rural bourgeoisie.
In most cases the land that was thus put up for sale was bought by the local rich peasants.
The role of the Peasants’ Bank became particularly great after the Revolution of 1905-07, when the government adopted a policy of creating “strong,” i.
e.
, kulak, bourgeois holdings in the villages.
(See article “The Agrarian [General] Policy of the Present Government,” Selected Works, Vol.
IV.
) Page 288.
* Work ‘Tor the honour of it” is work without payment, for a drink.
Engelhardt, the landlord who described his observations of rural life in a book entitled From the Country, lays bare the class nature of work “for the honour of it,” He points out that the essential thing was not the drinks, “because even women who drink no vodka come; occa­ sionally they even come without being called, simply on hearing that work is to be obtained.
Of course, all this is due to the peasant still being de­ pendent on the local landlord; the peasant needs firewood, he needs the meadow and the pasture, some day he may need money to borrow, and so on.
” (From the Country, 1897, p.
H7.
) And Engelhardt goes on to say that his own vegetable garden is always harvested in this way, “for the honour of it” It was the same in the village.
The peasants worked for a rich neigh­ bour “for the honour of it,” because here too the rural poor were de­ pendent on the kulak.
Page 291.
* The events of 1902-03 showed that the country was approach-ing a revolution.
The economic crisis which affected all the basic industries made the position of the working class, bad as it was, still worse: mass dismissals of workers, wage cuts, lower rates for piecework, etc.
The reply to this was a great rise in the strike move­ ment; some of these strikes in the South developed into general strikes.
A wave of peasant revolutionary outbreaks, for the most part directed against the landlords, swept the country—especially in the South of Russia and in the Saratov Gubernia.
In 1902 alone there were over 340 revolutionary peasant outbreaks.
At the same time the student movement, as well as the opposition movement of the liberal bourgeoisie, was on the ascendant.
It was in this heated atmosphere that the tsar’s Manifesto of March 11 (February 26), 1903, which is mentioned by Lenin, appeared.
4 After expressing the tsar’s grief at the ‘‘turmoil that is partly being cre­ ated by intentions hostile to the political order and is partly due to an infatuation for principles alien to Russian life,” the Manifesto went on to make some perfectly vague and non-committal promises to revise the “laws concerning the peasants,” promised somewhat more definitely to improve the position of the rural clergy, and called on the “loyal sons of the fatherland” to unite on a basis of “faith, law and authority.
" Page 300.
* This passage is sufficient proof that in advancing the demand for the restitution of the olrezki (see note to page 311**) Lenin was far from regarding this as the last step.

* “The Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy” ap­ peared in 1902 in Zarya.
It was intended as a commentary on the agrarian section of the programme which had been written mainly by Lenin and was afterwards adopted by the Second Congress of the Party.
(See note to page 341.
*) The ideas Lenin elaborated in the ten chapters of the article are as follows: 1) The Russian Social-Democratic Party must have an agrarian pro­ gramme.
“By an agrarian programme we mean the definition of the leading principles of Social-Democratic policy on the agrarian question, i.
e.
, in reference to agriculture and to the various classes, strata and groups of the rural population.
In a ‘peasant’ country like Russia the so­ cialist agrarian programme will naturally be mainly, if not entirely, a ‘peasant programme,’ a programme defining the attitude of the proletariat to the peasant question.
” 2) “The big landlords, the agricultural wage labourers and the ‘peas­ ants’—these are the three main components of the rural population of every capitalist country, including Russia.
” (Collected Works, Russian ed.
, Vol.
V.
) While supporting the peasants in their struggle against the big land­ lords, the Party must “maintain an unswerving class standpoint, and, far from surrendering anything of the proletarian standpoint to the in­ terests of the petty bourgeoisie, it must demand that the small peasant, who is ruined and ground down by the whole structure of capitalism, give up his own class standpoint and adopt that of the proletariat” (Ibid.
) This adoption by the small peasant of the proletarian stand­ point will be facilitated to the extent that the conditions “for the free development of the class struggle” are most fully realised.
This demands the abolition of all survivals of serfdom in the countryside.
“The peasant demands that are incorporated in the programme of the proletarian party must be subordinated” to these two conditions.
3) The agrarian programme which sets itself the object of bringing about conditions for the free development of the class struggle of the proletariat in the rural districts for socialism, against the bourgeoisie, will enable it to draw a line dividing it “not only from its enemies (i.
e.
, the direct and indirect, conscious and unconscious adherents of the bourgeoisie, who for a time and to a limited extent may be our allies in the light against the survivals of serfdom), but from those unreliable friends whose vague formulation of the agrarian questions can and does cause much harm to the revolutionary movement of die proletariat” (Ibid.
) 4) Lenin draws a fundamental distinction between the section of the programme dealing with the working class and that dealing with the peasants: ‘Tn both sections we set forth not our final objects, but only our immediate demands.
In both sections we keep within the confines of present-day (i.
e.
, bourgeois) society.
This constitutes the similarity be­ tween the two sections.
But the radical difference between them is that the demands contained in the working class section are directed against the bourgeoisie, while those contained in the peasant section are directed against the feudal landlords.
In the former section we have to confine ourselves to partial improvements of the existing bourgeois order.
In the latter we must aim at the complete cleansing of the present order of all survivals of serfdom.
.
.
.
In the working class section our im­ mediate demands cannot be revolutionary in the social sense, since the social revolution that will overthrow the domination of the bourgeoisie will be a revolution of the proletariat that will achieve our final aim.
In the peasant section we do include demands that are revolutionary in the social sense, since the social revolution that will overthrow the domination of the feudal landlords (i.
e.
, the social revolution of the bourgeoisie of the type of the Great French Revolution) is possible within the limits of the existing, bourgeois order.
” (Ibid.
) Owing to lack of space only one chapter of this article, chapter VII, is reproduced here.
The subjects of the other chapters are to a large extent covered by two articles included in the present volume, viz.
, ♦‘The Workers* Party and the Peasantry” and “To the Rural Poor” Chap­ ter VII is of special interest because it contains an analysis of the objec­ tions of the Economists (Martynov» etc.
) and the Socialist-Revolutionaries to Lenin’s views on the agrarian and peasant question; it is also interest­ ing on account of the dissensions it raised among the editors of Iskra on the question of land nationalisation.
(See notes to pages 318* and 319.
*) Even before the discussion of the present article, considerable friction had arisen between the editors, viz.
, between Lenin and Plekhanov, on a number of fundamental points, which were brought out in the course of the discussion of the programme.
(See note to page 224.
*) The situation in the editorial board became particularly acute in the course of the discussion of the present article.
Plekhanov formulated his dissensions in so rude and tactless a form that Lenin believed a breach of business and personal relations to be inevitable.
But in a letter dated July 3 (June 20), 1902, Plekhanov begged Lenin “not to be angry” with him and said that he “greatly respects” Lenin, that the two were sev­ enty-five per cent “nearer to each other than to any other member of the editorial board; we do differ about the remaining twenty-five per cent but seventy-five is more than twenty-five; so for the sake of what unites us we must forget about our differences** Lenin on his part slightly revised his article and left out the passage on nationalisation, which had raised particularly violent opposition.
The result was that the article, as it appeared in Zarya, No.

This section, which in the main was written by Lenin, as finally drafted, read as follows: “With the object of removing the survivals of serfdom, the burden of which lies heavily on the peasants, and in the interests of the free de­ velopment of the class struggle in the countryside, the Party demands first and foremost: *‘l) The abolition of land compensation payments and quit rent as well as of all payments to which peasants are liable as belonging to the tax paying ‘estate.
’ “2) The repeal of all laws restricting the rights of the peasant to dis­ pose of his land.
“3) The restitution to the peasants of all sums levied upon them in the form of land compensation payments and quit rent; the confisca­ tion, to this end, of the property of the monasteries and churches as well as of the land of the Appanages,1 of the tsai’s Cabinet’ and of the 1 Lands belonging to the tsar s family as a whole.

members of the tsars family; likewise the imposition of a special tax on the land of landowners belonging to the nobility who have profited by advances against land compensation payments; the sums thus ob­ tained shall form a special people's fund for the cultural and charitable needs of the rural communities.
“4) The institution of peasant committees: a) for the purpose of restor­ ing to the rural communities (by means of expropriation, or, in cases where the land has changed hands, by the state buying them out at the expense of the big landowners of the nobility) of lands which were cut off from the peasants’ holding® at the time of the abolition of serfdom and which serve in the hands of the landlords as a means of keeping the peasants in bondage; b) in the Caucasus for the purpose of transferring to the possession of the peasants the lands they occupy as ‘temporarily bonded’ peasants, Khizans, etc,; e) for the purpose of abolishing the remnants of feudal relations that have survived in the Urals, in the Altai, in the West and in other parts of the country.
“5) The courts shall be entitled to reduce unduly high land rents and to annul transactions of a bondage character.
” The documents connected with the drafting of this programme pub­ lished by the Marx-Engels Lenin Institute show that Lenin objected very strongly to any compensation being paid for the otrezki.
These documents contain the following amendments that he proposed to the agrarian sec­ tion of the programme: “I suggest that the fourth point of our agrarian programme be amended as follows: in place of the words: ‘The institu­ tion of peasant committees: a) for the restitution to the rural communities (by means of expropriation, or, in cases where the land has changed hands, by the state buying them out, etc,) of lands which .

,* i.
e.
, to delete the italicised passage” And Lenin goes on to give reasons for his suggestion: “1) Our agrar­ ian programme contains our ‘maximum,’ our ‘social-revolutionary de­ mands* (see my commentary1).
To admit compensation w’ould be in con­ tradiction to the social-revolutionary character of the demand.
2) Both the history of ‘compensation’ (compensation of 1861) and its content (e/, the famous ‘compensation’ is nothing else than purchase1 2) have the specific teste of a vulgarly goody-goody and bourgeois measure.
By seiz­ ing upon the fact that we have admitted compensation, it is quite pos­ sible for opponents to spoil the very essence of our demand (and there will be more than enough who will be ready to spoil it) ” Here Lenin 1 Lenin refers to the present article “The Agrarian Programme of Russian Social-Democracy.

, taking it without any compensation/’ The clause concerning compensation as it stands in the programme was considerably improved as compared with the original draft Lenin had in view when introducing his amendment The phrase about com­ pensation “at the expense of the big landowners of the nobility” was absent in the original draft and was inserted afterwards.
Sipeaking at the Third Congress about giving support to the peasant movement Lenin said: “We are definitely opposed to any sort of compensation.

* In 1899 Lenin wrote in a letter: “This ‘new critical current’ in Marxism, which attracts Struve and Bulgakov so much, seems to me to be highly suspicious.
” Lenin’s suspicions were very soon fully confirmed, when Bulgakov and other ‘‘legal Marxists” openly came out against Marxism and in partic­ ular against the Marxian doctrine of the development of agriculture and of class relations in the countryside.
The starting point of Marx and Lenin was that, in spite of certain peculiarities, the development of agriculture is, in the main, subject to the same laws as that of in­ dustry.
Even in backward regions agriculture has been drawn into the system of commodity production.
In agriculture, as in industry, large-scale production offers advantages over small-scale production.
The Jaw of the concentration of capital obtains in agriculture as well as in in­ dustry.
But Lenin points out that in distinguishing between large and small-scale production in agriculture, one should not start merely from the extent of the land area.
“The main line of development of capitalist agri­ culture is precisely that, while small-scale farming remains small as regards its area, it becomes large-scale as regards output, the amount of livestock, the use of fertilizers, the use of machinery, etc.
” (Collected Works, Rus­ sian ed.
, Vol.
XVIL) “The substitution of large for small-scale produc­ tion takes the form of the substitution of farms that are ‘small’ as to their acreage but more productive, more intensive and more capitalistic, for farms that are ‘large-scale’ as far as the acreage is concerned, but less productive, less intensive and less capitalistic.
” These economic developments in agriculture are accompanied by cor­ responding social changes in rural society: the class differentiation in the village; the growth of a proletariat and a bourgeoisie as the result of the washing away of the middle rural strata; increased wealth at one end, pauperisation at the other; the increased application of wage-labour, etc.
The capitalist development in the countryside is followed by the growth of all the contradictions inherent in capitalism: agricultural crises, the aggravation of the class struggle.
It is on these grounds that Marx and Lenin drew the conclusion of the inevitability of the prole­ tarian revolution in the countryside.
All these main points were called in question by the ‘'fashionable critics of Marxism/* David, Bernstein and others abroad, Bulgakov, Struve, etc.
, in Russia, maintained that agriculture was developing according to its own laws which were different from those that ruled industry.
The “critics’* denied the application of the law of concentration to agriculture, and they set out to prove the great advantages of small over large-scale farming.
They denied the growth of class differentia­ tion and, consequently, the intensification of the class struggle.
This natur­ ally led the “critics” to deny the inevitability of the proletarian revolu­ tion and to argue that even under capitalism agriculture was beginning “peacefully to grow into socialism'* with the aid of various kinds of co­ operative organisations.
In “Messrs, the ‘Critics* on the Agrarian Question” and in “New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture,” Lenin gave a detailed analysis of the views of the “critics.
” (See Selected IC orbs, Vol.
XIL) Page 318.
* The passage beginning: “Nationalisation of the land is a dif­ ferent matter” and ending “has landed Nadezhdin in a jungle of re­ actionary petty-bourgeois utopia” was the principal point of disagree­ ment between Lenin and Plekhanov in the discussion of Lenin’s article by the editors of Iskra; Ixmin left it out in the article as it appeared in Zarya, No.
4.
Lenin emphasises two points on the question of nationalisation.
First: the meaning and the nature of the slogan of nationalisation may diffet according to the historioal conditions in which it is advanced.
At the time of a bourgeois-democratic revolution directed against serfdom, na­ tionalisation, if linked up with revolutionary insurrection, may be a revolutionary measure.
Secondly: under capitalism, land nationalisation is not by itself a socialist measure, as was imagined by the Socialist-Rev­ olutionaries, but rather a condition for the accelerated development of capitalism.
“The abolition of private property in land is as far as bour­ geois society can go in eliminating the obstacles to the free application of capital to agriculture and to the free transfer of capital from one branch of production to another.
A free, ample and rapid development for capitalism, complete freedom for the class struggle”—this was Lenin’s definition of the aim of nationalisation, (See Collected JTorht, Russian ed.
, Vol.
XL) The other editors of Iskra approached the question in an entirely differ ent spirit.
Plekhanov wrote in the margin of Lenin’s manuscript: “In a police state, land nationalisation would be harmful, in a constitutional state it would become part of the demand for the nationalisation of all means of production.
” This amounted to rejecting nationalisation as the slogan of a revolutionary insurrection and to regarding it only as a socialist measure, as the “direct prologue to the socialisation of all means of production.
” (Martov’s formula, endorsed by Plekhanov.
) This altitude showed that Plekhanov and the others were unable to grasp Marx’s view of the matter.
, which was that land nationalisation only eliminated the class of landowners, and that in capitalist society the landowner was an entirely superfluous personage.
Lenin strongly dis­ agreed with the proposal, that was supported by all the other editors, that the anti-revolutionary nature of nationalisation should be pointed out; he was compelled to ignore the subject in his article and to leave out the passage referring to nationalisation.
That nationalisation is a blow at private property and may under certain circumstances become a measure contributing to the transition from a bourgeois-democratic revolution to a socialist revolution was sub­ sequently repeatedly emphasised by Lenin.
Pace 319.
* This makes it clear that Lenin, in opposition to all the other editors of Iskra, in principle favoured the demand for land nationalisa­ tion as “going beyond” the restitution of the otrezki from the point of view of capitalist development.
It also shows that in 1902, before the peasant uprisings in the South of Russia, Lenin believed nationalisa­ tion to be “politically inexpedient at the present moment.
” Subse­ quently, in 1903, in “To the Rural Poor,” Lenin explicitly said that the restitution of the otrezki was not a barrier: “It is a door.
We must pass through this door to be able to go further.
.
.
At the Third Congress of the Party (April-May 1905) a resolution moved by Lenin was passed on the attitude to be adopted towards the peasant movement.
The resolution virtually amended the clause of the programme concerning the otrezki, for it stated that “the Social-Demo­ crats set themselves the object of supporting as actively as they can all revolutionary measures of the peasantry which are capable of improv­ ing the position of the latter, including the confiscation of the land of the landlords, of the crowm, of the church, of the monasteries and of the appanages.
” (Minutes of the Third Congress, p.
552.
) Thus, it be­ came a question of confiscating all the landlords9 land and not only of that part of it which constitutes the otrezki.
At the Fourth Congress Lenin introduced a new agrarian programme, in which he advocated land nationalisation.
(See Selected f orks, Vol.
IV.
) Pace 322.
* On the eve of and during the Second Party Congress the fight for a consistent class Party programme was at the same time the fight for a correctly formulated programme on the question of nation­ alities.
It was then that the dissensions first became apparent which were to become so wide in the course of the discussions in 1913 and 1916.
Lenin had to fight against the Right, against the “nationalist ex­ aggerations'* and the “vacillations’* of the Bund, and against the Left, “against the clumsy attempt of a few Polish Social-Democrats to call in question the ‘right of nations to self-determination.

The P.

op­ posed their views to those of the Polish Social-Democrats, who were against the secession of Poland from Russia on the equally anti-Marxian ground that it was not permissible for a proletarian party to recognise the right of nations to self-determination and secession as an independ­ ent state, w’hich they declared to be incompatible with the international unity of the proletariat.
In contradistinction to the nationalism of the P.
P.
S.
, as well as to the “Ixfi” attitude of the Polish Social-Democrats, Lenin set forth, as a fundamental principle of the Party’s attitude to nationalities, the recognition of the right to self-determination which, however, must be subordinated to the general class aims of the struggle carried on by the proletariat and must be determined by the historical situation in which that struggle develops.
The ideas set forth by Lenin in the present article were subsequently further developed in the course of the discussions in 1913 and 1916, especially in “On the Right of Nations to Self-Determination” (Selected Works, Vol.
IV), “The Socialist Revolu­ tion and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination*’ (ibid.

**• The Polish Socialist Party (P.

In 1906 it split into two groups: a Right wing (praivica), which was nar­ rowly nationalistic and in 1919 became the P.
P.
S.
which still exists, and a Left wing (lewica), which had leanings towards petty-bourgeois socialism but which gradually came over to Marxism.
In 1918 a sec­ tion of the lewica and the Social-Democratic Party of Poland united to form the Communist Party of Poland.
The main point in the programme of the P.
P.
S.
was the establishment by the proletariat of cn independ­ ent republic of Poland which would unite the three parts of Poland that had been annexed by Russia, Prussia and Austria.
The means of obtaining this was armed insurrection against tsarism and terrorism against the agents of tsarism in Poland.
The nationalistic and patriotic slogans of the P.
P.
S.
found a favourable soil among the petty bour­ geoisie and petty-bourgeois revolutionary intelligentsia, as well as among certain sections of the Polish proletariat.
The P.
P.

was in many ways similar to the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks.

* In the forties and the sixties of the nineteenth century a rev­ olutionary democratic movement was in progress for the liberation of Poland from Russian, Prussian and Austrian rule (Poland had been parti­ tioned among these three countries).
In January 1846 an insurrection broke out in Cracow which proved to be one of the forerunners of the wave of revolutionary movements which swept Western Europe and cul­ minated in the French, German and Austrian Revolutions of 1848.
In January 1863 this was repeated on a vastly larger scale when the Poles rose against the hangman's regime of oppression that had been intro­ duced by Russian tsarism.
Russia, against whom Polish democracy directed its offensive, was then the stronghold of reaction and the “gendarme of Europe.
“ The reactionary role of tsarism was particularly effective at home because it had no revolutionary forces to oppose it; there was no mass revolutionary movement in Russia at that time.
In the ’forties and 'sixties (and later at the time of the Paris Com­ mune) Marx and Engels welcomed the movement for the liberation of Poland.
They were in favour of the restoration of Poland for the follow­ ing three reasons: a) the struggle of the Poles against Russia was not merely a Polish cause, but a cause that affected the whole of European democracy, for it was a struggle against the gendarme of Europe; b) the restoration of a democratic Poland would mean the establishment of a strong defensive barrier between reactionary Russia and democratic Europe: West European reaction, deprived of direct contact with Russian reaction, would be greatly weakened; c) “No nation can be free if it oppresses other nations.
” (Engels.
) The liberation of the parts of Poland that were subject to Germany and Austria would deal a blow at reaction in those countries and destroy the mutual solidarity of the powers that had taken part in the “partition” of Poland at the end of the eighteenth century (Austria, Prussia and Russia); it un­ hooked, as it were, German and Austrian reaction from the chariot of the Emperor of Russia.
It goes without saying that Marx and Engels considered revolution to be the only possible method of solving the Polish question.
The ab­ sence of a revolutionary movement in Russia was the reason Marx and Engels advocated a “revolutionary war” uf Germany against Russia for the liberation of Poland.
Marx’s and Engels* formulation of the ques­ tion was the result of a concrete historical analysis; their demand for Polish independence was subordinated to the interests of the revolution; it was a link in their revolutionary programme.
Hence the polemics, re­ ferred to by Lenin, of Marx against Rugc.
The latter was a bourgeois democrat, a German man of letters and a member of the Left wing of the Frankfort Parliament.
In the course of a three-day debate on the Polish question in that parliament, he made a bombastic speech in which, instead of proceeding from a historical analysis of the concrete situa­ tion, or from the interests of the revolution, he appealed to abstract principles of justice and of the unity (supposed unity) of the three great European countries, France, England and Germany.
Marx who was at that time, jointly with Engels, editor of Die Neue Rheinische Zeitung, published an article in that paper, entitled “The Debate on the Polish Question in Frankfort,” in which he submitted Ruge’s standpoint to devastating criticism.
This is what Lenin refers to when he says: “Marx violently attacked Kuge.
” Page 330.
* This refers to the time of the Paris Commune.
“The govern­ ment of national defence” was formed in Paris on September 4, 1S70, after the French parliament, acting under the pressure of the insurgent people, had proclaimed the deposition of Napoleon III who had been taken prisoner by the Germans.
It was a government of the Paris bour­ geoisie.
Its object was to carry on the war which had been started by Napoleon III and was virtually lost by that time, and to defend Paris and the whole country from the Gertnan invasion.
But at the same time a movement of the artisans, of the petty bourgeoisie generally and espe­ cially of the proletariat, was growing in Paris, which the bourgeoisie con­ sidered far more dangerous than the German army that had besieged Paris (the siege began in September 1870).
To be able tc crush the workers’ movement the “government of national defence” decided to surrender Paris to the Germans.
All the measures it took to defend the town were mere pretence.
In fact, the government of national defence was a government of national treason.
The result of this sort of “de­ fence” was that Paris was ultimately forced to capitulate (January 28, 1871) on dishonourable terms.
By the terms of the capitulation the Germans occupied part of the fort*.
Subsequently this greatly facilitated the task of the bourgeoisie of crushing the Paris Commune, which was a government organised, for the first time in history, on the basis of proletarian dictatorship.

* The nationalism of the Bund, which revealed itself in the couree of the debate on the Party programme, grew into separatism, i.
e.
, a tendency to secede organisationally from Russian Social-Democracy.
On the eve of and at the Second Party Congress, Lenin had to wage a fierce struggle against the Bund.
It resulted in the withdrawal of the delegates of the Bund from the Congress and from the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, to which the Bund had been affiliated ever since the First Congress (1898), In “Does the Jewish Proletariat Need an Independent Political Party’?’* Lenin denounced these separatist tendencies of the Bund and all the harm they did to the interests of the class struggle of the proletariat.
On the question of nationalities, as on the question of organisation, the Bund gave first consideration to “national” (or rather nationalist) interests.
For Lenin, in both cases, the principal thing was the general interests of the class struggle of the proletariat.
And it was to these interests that he subordinated the right of nations to self-determination as well as the organisational principles of the Party.
The lessons of the struggle against the Bund in 1902-03 have not yet lost their significance.
The organisational relations of the C.
P.
S.
U, with the Communist Parties of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union are based today on the same principles for which Lenin fought in the early years of the century, viz.
, the national Communist Parties are autonomous in local matters, but are subject to the centralised leadership of a single Central Committee, and not on the principles the Bund stood for, viz.
, federations of separate, virtually independent parties, with a Central Com­ mittee composed of representatives of the affiliated parties who would be subject to recall and responsible, not to the Parly as a whole, but only to the organisation that elected them.

* This refers to Kautsky’s pamphlet Die soziale Revolution, which appeared in German in 1902 and was translated into Yiddish.
Pace 341.
* The Second Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Party occupies a special place in the history of Bolshevism because it was at this Congress that the split took place between the revolutionary Leninist “majority” and the opportunist “minority” and the foundation of the Bolshevik Party, as a separate party, was laid.
In his “Left-Wing” Communism, an Infantile Disorder, Lenin wrote: “Bol­ shevism, as a trend of political thought and as a political party, exists since 1903.
” In saying this he had in mind the split that took place at the Second Party Congress.
This split marked the beginning of a party of a new type, and of its development into the guiding force of a broad revolutionary movement This party was, in principle, different from the parties affiliated to the Second International (“a party of a new type under no circumstances à Ia Second International,” as Lenin once wrote), and was the only party capable of being the real vanguard of the revolu­ tionary class and of leading it “in the most ruthless, determined and last fight against all the forces of capitalism.
” {Collected Works, Russian ed.
, Vol.
XXV.
) This split also marked the beginning of the policy of breaking with the opportunists in thé Russian Social-Democratic Party as well as in the Second International which, as Comrade Stalin says in his “Letter to the Proletarskaya Revolutsiya” (See Leninism, Vol.
II), has been conducted by Lenin and the Bolsheviks “approximately since 1903X)4,” and without which the victory of the proletarian revolution in the Soviet Union, and the formation of the Communist International, this fundamental condition of the victory of the world revolution, would have been impossible.
This is the principal significance of the Second Congress of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
The Second Congress and its immediate result, the formation of Bol­ shevism into a political party, were prepared by the enormous work which was carried on under the direct leadership of Lenin by Iskra, (See note to page 3.
*) It was Iskra, also under the direct leadership of Lenin, that made all the direct organisational preparations for the Congress.
At the beginning of 1902, the editorial board of Iskra and Zarya pro­ ceeded to draw up the draft of a Party programme, which was ultimately published in Iskra in the summer of 1902.
In the spring of that year (March-April) Iskra took the first steps towards setting up an Organ­ isation Committee for the Second Congress.
At that time the League of Social-Democrats Abroad (the “Economists”), jointly* with the Bund, made a second attempt to convene the Second Congress (the first attempt was made by the League in May 1901, but was unsuccessful).
The enor­ mous educational and organisational work undertaken by Iskra had been far from completed, and the Social-Democratic organisations in Russia had not yet matured sufficiently to be organised into a single party.
The attempt made to convene the Second Congress, therefore, prematurely threatened to retard the work undertaken by Iskra and to disrupt its work of rallying the Social-Democratic forces and building the Party.
Iskra agreed to take part in the proposed congress in order to try to have it converted into a preliminary conference, and this it succeeded in doing.
Owing to the small number of representatives present at the Con­ gress, which was convened in the town of Byelostok, it was agreed, on the proposal of the representative of Iskra, to declare die gathering a conference exclusively for the purpose of setting up an Organisation Committee for convening the Second Congress.
(See note to page 411.
*) This first attempt to set up an Organisation Committee failed, for all the members elected to this Committee were arrested soon after the conference.
Only at the end of 1902 was it found possible to restore the Committee at a conference convened in Pskov on the initia­ tive of Iskra.
(Sec note to page 342.
*) From that moment, not only was the immediate work of preparing for the Second Congress begun, but so also was the actual amalgamation of the local organisations; the Organisation Committee not only served as an organising centre for convening the Congress, but also as a centre for maintaining contact be­ tween, and leading the current work of, the local organisations.
All the practical preparatory work of convening the Second Congress lay on the shoulder« of the Iskra organisation and the Iskra agents in the districts, who travelled from town to town setting up Iskra commit­ tees, organising the technique of Party work, establishing contacts, org­ anising the shipment of literature, etc.
Among these Iskra “agents” were professional revolutionaries such as S.
Radchenko, L.
B.
Krassin, R.
S.
Zrmlyachka, S.
Bobrovsky, J.
Pyatnitsky, I.
Babushkin and others.
All the threads of practical and ideological leadership were concentrated in the hands of the editorial board of Iskra, the actual leader of which was Lenin; he was assisted by a small group of comrades (N.
Krupskaya and others).
After nearly three years of practical work and of ideological leader­ ship of the organisations in Russia by Iskra, the Organisation Committee, on July 30, 1903, convened the Second Congress abroad at which, with few exceptions, all the active Russian Social Democratic organisations (committees and leagues) were able to be represented.
The majority of the representatives w’erc adherents of Iskra, i.
e,, the revolutionary trend in the Russian Social-Democratic movement.
The task at the Second Congress was to consolidate the victory of revolutionary Social-Democracy over ideological confusion and vacillation and over the opportunist elements, and to consolidate, on the basis of revolutionary Marxian principles, the leadership of the struggles of the proletariat in the impending Russian revolution.
The fulfilment of this fundamental task opened a new epoch in the history of the revolutionary movement of the Russian working class and in the history of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.
The Second Congress did great positive work in actually creating a proletarian party: it adopted the general theoretical principles of Iskra, adopted a programme, drew up a set of rules (in doing so, however, it distorted Lenin’s draft of the rules, by adopting the opportunist formula­ tion of point 1 proposed by Martov) and set up organs of Party leader­ ship.
It was in the process of this work that the Congress, and soon after, the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, split into a “majority” led by Lenin and a “minority” led by Martov and Axelrod and subsequently by Plekhanov.
The “minor­ ity,” the leaders of which differed with Lenin on a number of ques­ tions even before the Congress while they were working together on Iskra, proved incapable of the task of building up a proletarian -party with a strict class selection of membership, with militant centralism and with iron proletarian discipline.
The minority of the Second Congress revived, on a new basis and in a new form, the opportunist trend in the ranks of Russian Social-Democracy represented in the past, when the Party was in its embryonic state, by “Economism,” ‘legal Marxism,” the nationalism and federalism of the Bund and anarchist individualism, which had been attacked and defeated by Iskra politically and organisa­ tionally.
The process of building up the revolutionary parly of the pro­ letariat had still to pass through the stern period of the hardening of the future cadres of the Party in the severe struggle against the new form of opportunism personified by the minority at the Second Congress.
This was the positive significance of the period of the split in the R.

These were the birth pangs of the Bolshevik Party, the genuinely revolutionary party of the Russian proletariat.

” is Lenin’s report of the results of the Second Congress written for a small circle of political friends, adherents of the majority.
The “Account” was written within a few days after the Congress, under the fresh im­ pression of the struggle inside the Party which had broken out at the Congress and which became the starting point for the split in the Party into a majority and a minority.
The postscript to the “Account” tells of the disruptive activity of the minority during the first two or three weeks after the Congress.
“The split among the /sAro-ists was one of the principal political re­ sults of the Congress”—such is Lenin’s estimate of the main outcome of the Second Party Congress.
The whole history of the Party during the ensuing fifteen years fully confirmed the importance of this fundamental political result of the Congress.
In the course of the struggle and split at the Second Congress the “firm IsAra-ists” became the nucleus of the Bolshevik Party.

The Committee had been controlled by the Econ­ omists and at the time of the Second Congress the struggle between the revolutionary (/sAnz-ist) and the opportunist (Economist) tendencies had not yet come to a head: the Committee was on the side of Iskra, but besides the Committee there was a so-called Workers’ Organisation which was controlled by the Economists.

But in organisa­ tional matters the group did not share the Iskra-ist methods of building the Party (centralism) and wanted to preserve and reinforce its independ­ ence.

B, Ryazanov, J.
M.
Steklov and E.
L.
Danevich-Gurevich; it was formed in Paris in the beginning of 1901.
At first the members of the group con­ tributed to hkra and Zarya, After unsuccessful attempts to establish a federal connection with the editorial board of Iskra (i.
e.
, to become members of the latter with special rights for the Borba group) and at­ tempts, equally unsuccessful, to unite the League of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad with hkra, the Borba group came out as an inde­ pendent literary group of Social-Democrats distinct from the League as well as from hkra, and tried to occupy an intermediate position between the two.
But in reality this was an opportunist position devoid of any foundation or principle in theory, organisation and the strategy and tactics of the Party.
Thus, the Borba group was violently opposed to the organisational ideas of hkra.
It was equally opposed to the strategy and tactics of the latter and to its view of the role of the pro­ letariat in the leadership of the democratic revolution.
At the Second Congress the Borba group was dissolved, along with all the other groups.
The most prominent personality in the group, Ryazanov, continued to occupy the same sort of unprincipled position; he remained an anti-Leniu-isL In 1930 he was expelled from the C.

* The episode in connection with the ‘‘equal status of languages’’ occurred at the sixteenth and seventeenth sessions of the Congress and was not finally cleared up till the twenty-first session.
At the sixteenth session, when the Party programme was being discussed .
point by point, a dispute arose about point 7 of the political part of the programme which had been drafted as follows by the Programme ('.
ommittce: “The abolition of ‘estates’ and complete, equal rights for all citizens, regard­ less of sex, religion, race, nationality or language.
” The opposition, headed by the delegates of the Bund, was not satisfied with the mere addition of the words “nationality or language” at the end of the para­ graph and demanded the introduction of a clause in the programme in favour of equality of languages.
After a prolonged debate which took up two sessions (the sixteenth and seventeenth) and after three votes by roll call, which revealed a certain instability in the ranks of the /s&ra-ists, a motion introduced by Martynov was finally passed by a major­ ity of 26 against 25 which referred the point to the Committee to be redrafted.

4141 The Tagesordnung (agenda) of the Second Congress had been drawn up by Lenin several weeks before it met.
It was accompanied by explanatory notes to each item.
Lenin communicated his draft to Martov who suggested a few amendments, some of which Lenin accepted.
Lenin’s final draft was submitted to the hkraist nucleus before the Congress, and to all the delegates at the Congress.
I^enin reported on his draft agenda at the meeting of the O.

on a federal basis, i.
e.
, to preserve, by a special treaty with the Party, certain special rights as compared with the other organisations, and primarily the right to be.

The resolution that was passed by the Congress definitely stated that “a re­ construction of the organisational relations between the Jewish and the Russian proletariat on a federal basis would be a serious obstacle in the path of the further organisational rapprochement among the class conscious proletarians of different races, and would inevitably greatly prejudice the interests of the proletariat of Russia in general and of its Jewish section in particular”; for this reason it definitely rejected “as absolutely inadmissible in principle the very idea of federal relations l»etween the R.

* The Rabocheye Dyc/o-ist.
Akimov-Makhnovets (as Lenin points out), repeated in two of his speeches on point 1 of the rules (twenty-second and twenty-third sessions) his reasons for voting in favour of Martov’s wording.
In the former he said: “I endorse the wording pro­ posed by Martov not because it precisely formulates what I consider the desirable relations between the Party and its organisations, but because it takes a step in the direction of a satisfactory solution of the problem” (satisfactory according to Rabocheye Dyeto—in the direction of greater ’’democracy").
In his second speech Akimov gave the following reason for supporting Martov's wording: “Comrades Martov and Lenin dispute which wording is better suited to obtain the end both of them want; Brooker and I want to choose that which is the Jess conducive to that end.
From this point of view I choose Martov’s.

Pace 352/ The point at issue on the question of co-qptation of members to the central bodies (which arose in the course of the debate on point 12 of the rules) was as follows: Lenin proposed that co-optation to the C.
C.
and to the editorial board of the C.
O.
be made by each of these central Indies subject to the consent of the other (reciprocal co-optation).
At the twenty-sixth session he used the following arguments to prove that recip­ rocal co-optation was important and necessary: “What is infinitely more important is that the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
Ire given the right to control each other’s co-optation.
The mutual agreement of the two centres is the necessary condition for harmony.
The issue at stake is a rupture between the two centres.
Whoever is opposed to a split must do his best to secure harmony.
The history of the Party teaches us that there have been people who worked for a split.
The issue is one of (principle, an important issue, for the future of the Party may depend on it.
” Lenin’s amendment to the effect that co-optatio * could only be allowed “subject to the unanim­ ous consent of all the members of the Council of the Party” was rejected, and the majority voted for Martov’s amendment which provided that in the absence of agreement between the C.
C, and the C.
O.
the matter be brought before the Council of the Party, and, if the Council re­ voked the decision of the C.
C.
or of the C.

” After a debate on this statement and the passing of a resolu­ tion inviting them to withdraw it, Martynov and Akimov left the Congress.

*** The League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democrats Abroad was the organisation of the revolutionary wing of the Russian So­ cial-Democrats outside Russia.
It was formed in October 1901 after the failure of the attempt to amalgamate the League of Russian Social-Demo­ crats Abroad with the Emancipation of Labour group, the revolutionär}’ organisation of Sotsial-Demokrat and the section of Iskra and Zarya abroad, at a joint congress of these organisations.
(See note to page 27.
*) According to its original rules, the League was “the sec­ tion of the Iskra organisation abroad“ and its activities consisted main­ ly in “contributing to the publication and circulation of hkra and Zarya” in the “propaganda outside Russia of the ideas of revolutionary Social-Democracy,’’ in “assisting, with the aid of the Iskra organisation In Russia, the Social-Democratic organisations in Russia by training militant workers.
” After the Second Congress of the Party the League became the stronghold and the instrument of the minority in the fight against the majority.

* The boycott of the central bodies of the Party by the Martov­ ists was inaugurated by Martov, while the Congress was still sitting, when he refused to accept his election to the editorial board of the C.

** Lenin was responsible for the draft rules of the Party which were discussed by the commission and subsequently at the plenary session of the Congress.
The present speech, which is a brief general statement on the rules, was delivered at the first session held after the Congress removed to London from Brussels.
Pace 358.
*** This speech was made in defence of the formulation of point 1 of the rules proposed by Lenin in answer to a number of opponents who had spoken in favour of Martov’s formulation.
It was made at the twenty-third session of the Congress.
Pace 359.
* Axelrod’s speech, to which Lenin replies in the beginning of his speech had been made at the preceding twenty-second session.
Axelrod ended by saying: “As formulated by Lenin, point 1 is in direct contradic­ tion in principle to the very essence and to the objects of the Social-Democratic Party of the proletariat.
But I see that I am knocking at an open door, for Comrade Lenin’s suggestion of peripheric circles con­ sidered as part of the Party organisation is a step to meet me.
There remain isolated individuals, but even here we can hope to strike a bar­ gain.
” The phrase “peripheric circles” refers to a short statement previ­ ously made by Lenin at the same session in which he defended bis form­ ulation of point 1 of the rules.
It appears in the minutes as follows: “Lenin briefly defends his formulation, emphasising in particular that it gives a stimulus to ‘becoming organised.
’ It should not be imagined that Party organisations must consist exclusively of professional revolution­ aries.
We want a great variety of organisations of the most varied kinds, ranks and shades, from exceedingly narrow and secret ones to very broad and free, lose organisationen (loose organisations).
The necessary mark of a Party* organisation is that it be confirmed by the Central Committee.
” Pace 359.

Pace 359.
*** In replying to Trotsky who, at the twenty-third session of the Congress, spoke immediately before him, Lenin said that “Trotsky has completely misunderstood the fundamental idea advanced by Plekhanov” (who had spoken earlier in the day).
Plekhanov’s main contention, when speaking against Martov’s formulation and in favour of Lenin’s, was ex­ pressed in the conclusion of his speech as follows: “Neither am I able to understand why it is imagined that Lenin’s proposal, if passed, would close our Party to any considerable number of workers.
A worker who wants to join the Party will not be deterred by having to join an organ­ isation.
A worker is not afraid of discipline.
The people who will be deterred will be the intellectuals who are permeated with bourgeois in­ dividualism.
And it is a very good thing that they will be deterred.
As a rule, these bourgeois individualists are also the spokesmen of every kind of opportunism.
We must keep them at a distance.
Lenin’s proposal may become a barrier against their invading the Party, and this alone makes it imperative for all opponents of opportunism to vote in favour of it.
” Pace 362.
* This speech was delivered by Lenin at the end of the Congress, al the thirty-first sassion, on September 2 (August 20).
At the preceding session, all the members of the editorial board of Iskra being absent, the Congress discussed the methods of setting up the editorial board of the C.
O.
: either by endorsing the whole of the previous editorial board or by electing a “group of three” which could later co-opt the required number of members.
At the beginning of the session a vote was taken on this question and Trotsky’s motion “to endorse the whole of the old editorial board” was rejected.
After the vote was taken the members of the edi­ torial board were invited to enter the Congress hall and the decision was announced to them.
After this, Martov made a “declaration in the name of the majority of the former editorial board” to the effect that four of the former editors (Martov, Potresov, Axelrod and Zasulich) em­ phatically refused to work on the new editorial board, that they regarded the election of Martov to the new editorial board as a personal slur on his reputation, and that, according to Martov, the decision of the Con­ gress not to endorse the former editorial board and to elect a “group of three” in its place meant the introduction of a “state of siege in the Party and the introduction of exceptional laws against certain groups.
” The speech given here is Lenin’s reply to Martov, and the whole of the Opposition at the Congress which he led, on the question of the elections to the central bodies of the Party.
In this speech Lenin gives the first political characterisation of the minority.
Pace 366.
* In the course of the first six weeks after the Second Congress (from the end of August to the beginning of October) the new editorial board (Lenin and Plekhanov) and the elected members of the Central Committee (Noskov and Lengnik) made repeated attempts to induce Martov to take part in the work of the editorial board and to induce his adherents to contribute to Iskra, and in this way to stop the in­ cipient split in the Party.
But all these attempts on the part of the editorial board of the C.
O.
and of the C.
C.
to put an end to the in­ cipient dissension and actual split in the Party from the very outset, not­ withstanding the concessions the central bodies were prepared to make to the minority, failed as a consequence of the obstinacy of the leaders of the minority group abroad, headed by Martov, who strove to secure pre­ dominance in the central bodies of the Party and made excessive de­ mands during the negotiations.
While the minority was displaying this unyielding attitude in the ne­ gotiations with the central bodies of the Party, they secretly rallied and organised their forces (i.
e.
, formation of a faction within the Party) and carried on an active struggle to seize the Party leadership.
Between Sep­ tember 13 and 20, a three-day conference was held in Geneva of seven­ teen prominent representatives of the minority who were then abroad.
This conference drew up a definite programme of action which was binding on all the adherents of the minority.
This programme set forth, as the main task, the capture of all the organs of Party leadership, and the means proposed to achieve this were: penetration into the Party com­ mittees, agitation in the districts against the C.
O.
and the C.
C.
, systematic boycott of the central bodies of the Party as constituted at the Congress and the establishment of their own press organ.
The methods used by the minority in their fight against the central bodies and against the majority included the attempt to capture the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democrats Abroad.
The minority made this their first practical objective, inasmuch as the ordinary con­ gress of the League was soon to l>e held in accordance with the rules.
The minority succeeded in having the congress called, and it was held at Geneva from October 26 to 31, 1903.
Pace 376.
* The resolution moved by Starover read as follows: "'The R.

” The other resolution drafted by Plekhanov, and supported by the delegates of the majority only, was as follows: “Taking into consider­ ation: a) that Social-Democracy must support the bourgeoisie to the ex­ tent to which the latter is revolutionary, of even merely oppositional in its fight against tsarism; b) that Social-Democracy must consequently welcome the awakening of the political consciousness of the Russian bourgeoisie; but that on the other hand, that it is its duty to expose to the proletariat the limited and inadequate character of the emancipation movement of the bourgeoisie wherever this limited and inadequate char­ acter finds expression—the Second ordinary Congress of the R.

* Iskra, No.
53, was the first number to appear under the new editorial board that had been co-opted by Plekhanov (the four previous editors—Martov, Potresov, Axelrod and Zasulich) on December 8 (Nov­ ember 25), 1903.
Lenin became finally convinced that the Martovists had taken Iskra “for war” against the majority.
The political complexion of the new editorial group and the position of the new Iskra as regards the situation inside the Party are best illustrated by two articles in that issue: the leading article, entitled “Our Congress,” written by Martov (see note to page 380*) and an editorial note written by Plekhanov in the “Party News” section in reply to Lenin’s letter to the editors, which appeared in the issue commenting on Plekhanov’s article “What Should Not Be Done?.
” Immediately after perusing No.
53, apparently between December 21 and 23 (8 and 10), Lenin jotted down “A Note on the Position of the New Iskra' which we here reproduce.
The note remained in his papers and was not directly used for the press.
Page 378.
** The reference to the Congress of the League indicates that it was particularly at this Congress that the minority revealed itself as a “party of rejected Ministers or hysterical rowdies.
” Page 380.
* “Our Congress” by Martov—which appeared in Iskra, No.
53, and called forth from Lenin the first reply in “A Note on the Position of the New Iskra" referred to above—criticised the decision of the Sec­ ond Congress from the standpoint of the minority.
It accused the majority of interpreting centralism in a formal and bureaucratic way, attempted to minimise the importance of the Congress and entirely distorted the cause of the dissensions that had arisen at the Congress, of the fight started after the Congress between the majority and the minority and, in particu­ lar, Lenin’s reasons for resigning from the editorial board.
In his letter “Why I resigned from the Editorial Board of Iskra” Lenin answers Martov by giving an account of the actual course of events at the Con­ gress which led to the split in the IskraAst organisation, as well as the subsequent facts and events after the Congress which further aggravated the split Lenin intended the letter for the following issue of Iskra (No.
54).
But Martov, acting in the name of the editorial board, refused to print it, hypocritically giving as his reason that the letter referred to facts of Party life which “must not be discussed in the columns of the Party press as long as there is any hope of eliminating the conflict inside the Party.
” This is why Lenin’s letter had to be printed by the Iskra press as a separate leaflet and circulated in this form in Russia and abroad.
The open letter ‘kWhy I Resigned from the Editorial Board of Iskra” was Lenin’s first public explanation addressed to wide Party circles of the nature and significance of the dissensions at the Second Congress.
Pace 382.
* The reference is to the abstention of the whole coalition of the minority and the non-/s&ra-ist3 (a total of 20 votes) at the election of the C.
C.
, of the editors of the C.
O.
(at the thirty-first session) and of a fifth member of the Council of the Parly (at the thirty-second session).
Only the delegates of the majority voted at these elections, and they alone elected the central bodies.

* “A Robespierre regime of executions,” to which the writers of the minority (in the writings enumerated in the preceding note) likened the line taken by Lenin in bis fight for a firm, united and centralised Party leadership, was the dictatorship of the revolutionary party of the Jacobins (the Mountain or Montagnards) led by Robespierre, who used terror (which took the form of executions by the guillotine) on a vast scale against the enemies of the Revolution (including the Girondists).

* The exceptional measures taken by the C.
C against the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democrats Abroad were the following: 1) At the last meeting of the League (October 31 [18]), F.
V.
Lengnik, the representative of the C.
C.
abroad, declared the further continuation of the Congress out of order, and then formally dissolved the Congress, which he left together with the other members of the League who adhered to the majority; 2) on the following day (November 1 [October 19]) the Council of the Party endorsed the action of the representative of the C.
C.
abroad as well as his proposal to reorganise the League by introducing new members; 3) finally, for a whole month after the Congress of the League, the CC.
in the person of its representative refused to recognise the new Administrative Council that had been elected by the minority half of the Congress of the League after the withdrawal of the majority, while the agents of the CC.
outside Russia and the members of the League who supported the majority boycotted the League.
All these measures were provoked by the openly disruptive behaviour of the minor­ ity half of the Congress of the League towards the C.

* After Iskra had passed under the control of the minority, the minority started a hue and cry against Lenin in their paper and at meetings abroad.
They conducted a systematic attack on the CC.
by waging a petty “war” against its representative abroad in connection with the practical everyday work and by sending emissaries to Russia to agitate in the committees against the C.
C.
With this object they organised a trans­ port service of their own to convey persons and literature over the frontier.
Immediately after the appearance of Iskra, No.
53, Lenin, on December 23 (10), wrote to the members of the C.
C.
in Russia stating that the minority showed no signs of desiring peace and that from the outset the minority had begun to use the CO.
for war against the CC.
He proposed the calling of a special Party congress to the C.
Q as the immediate task of the moment He pointed out that a fight against the disruption in the Party, which the minority was openly and systematically causing through Iskra and in connection with practical work in the centres and in the local committees, would provide a stirring battle cry for the congress.
The answer he expected did not arrive as soon as the situation demanded.
Knowing as he did the conciliatory attitude of the members of the CC.
Lenin lost no time in doing his best to influence them and to convince them that his view of the situation, as well as the way out which he proposed, was the right one.

During this time the situation in the Party had been developing and growing worse every day.
The minority stubbornly strove to obtain its main end, the seizure of the C.
C.
, which would finally place all the leading organs of the Party in its power.
All the alarm signals of the section of the C.
C.
outside Russia and all the energetic appeals made by Lenin remained unanswered for weeks on end by the C.
C.
in Russia; on the other hand, the news that did come fPom time to time from Russia revealed the contented and optimistic state of mind in the home members of the C.
C.
, or at any rate of their leading group, concerning the situation in the Party.
The efforts of the minority to disorganise the ranks of the Party were increasingly successful; the split spread and became deeper and deeper.
All this caused Lenin to increase his efforts to convince the home members of the C.
C.
of the necessity of calling a special congress.

** The parallel drawn by Axelrod between Lenin and Schweizer and between the line followed by Lenin and the “dictatorship of Schweizer” merely repeated the parallel drawn by Plekhanov in his answer to Lenin’s letter which appeared in Iskra, No.
53, in reply to Plekhanov’s article “What Should Not Be Done?” Schweizer was Las­ salle's successor in the leadership of the General Association of German Workers.
After the latter’s death he became iu head, and was given dictatorial powers by the members of the Union.
He was the type of ambitious petty-bourgeois politician and demagogue who, instead of bas­ ing his policy on the class consciousness and the class struggle of the proletariat, based it on personal wire-pulling and on bargains with the Bismarck government aimed against the bourgeois liberals.
Pace 394.
* In accordance with point 2 of the Party rules, the Council of the Party was obliged to call a congress if this was demanded by Party organisations whose total votes were equal to half the votes of the con­ gress.
When raising the question of calling a special congress, Lenin calculated that two-thirds, 33 out of 49, of the votes of the aggregate Party organisation would be in favour of a congress.
Pace 395.
* Iskra, No.
56, which came out on January 14 (1), 1904, contained an article by Martov, “The Next Thing (Circle or Party?),“ in which he tried to prove that since the Second Congress the term Iskra-ist had become obsolete; it had ceased to express the revolutionary tendency in Russian Social-Democracy, and had become the expression of the reactionary aspirations inspired by the circle spirit The article called forth a strong protest from Lenin against the annexationist policy of the Mensheviks and their flagrant distortion of decisions of the Party that were perfectly clear and simple, in particular Martov’s distortions of these decisions in his article.
At first Lenin intended to express his protest in the form of an open letter “To Members of the Party.
” He wrote the present letter and pre­ pared it for the press; but it was not published.
One of the reasons which caused Lenin to refrain from doing as he had intended was that at this point Plekhanov called a meeting of the Council of the Party for February 10 (January 28).
The opportunity of using the tribune of the Council of the Party for a battle of principle with the editors of the C.
O.
and the prospect, which Lenin still regarded as by no means hope­ less, of snatching Plekhanov away from his allies, the Martovists, in the course of an open battle with the latter, caused Lenin to refrain from sending his letter “To Members of the Party” to the press.

* The reference is to the resolution on Lenin's report and Martov’s co-reporl on the subject of the Second Party Congress.
The resolution was moved at the fourth session of the Congress of the League by Trotsky and others, and was passed by the Congress when practically all the members of the League who adhered to the majority were absent.
The concluding section of the resolution contained the following: .
The League deeply regrets that when establishing official Party centres the Congress should have neglected all continuity with the Party centres that actually existed, thus weakening the useful effect of the measures it had passed in the course of the first half of its work and greatly impeding the work of all Party workers in bringing together the class conscious elements of the fighting proletariat.

Point 18 of the standing orders ran: ’’All the decisions of the Congress and all the elections organised by it are decisions of the Party, obligatory for all Party organisations.
They cannot be invalidated by anyone or under any circumstances and cannot be repealed or modified otherwise than by a subsequent Party congress.
” In endorsing this point of the standing orders, the organisations of the Party confirmed their unqualified submission to all the decisions of the Congress.
Lenin’s reference is also to the repeated confirmation, by the delegates at the Congress, of the obligatory character of the decisions of the Congress for themselves and for all Party members.

* The Council of the Party met for three day$, February 10-12 (January 28-30), 1904.
As the first item on the agenda Lenin put the question of condemning the impermissible methods of Party strife which had been used by the minority (boycott of the central bodies of the Party eletted by the Congress; cutting off the C.
C.
from financial sources; undermining the authority of the C.
C.
; the establishment inside the Party of a separate organisation of its own by the minority (of a special fund, a special transport service and a special set of agents for dealings with the committees).
The spokesmen of the minority in the Council, Martov and Axelrod, actively supported by Plekhanov, de­ feated Lenin’s motion on the subject and adopted Plekhanov’s pro­ posal on the necessity of co-opting members of the minority to the C.
C By the same majority (the opposition in alliance with Plekhanov) the Council turned down Lenin’s proposal to call a special congress.
The January session of the Council of the Party thus contributed towards making the situation exceedingly clear: henceforward, besides the editorial board of the C.
O.
, the Council was to be the instrument of the factional work of the minority and this instrument was to be used in the first place to crush the C.
C.
, to change its personnel in the interests of the minority, and thus to complete the revolution in the Party leader­ ship that had begun with the seizure of the editorial board by the oppo­ sition.
Events fully and obviously confirmed the correctness of the resolute line taken by Lenin in favour of calling a special Party con­ gress, the necessity of which Lenin had been insisting on and explain­ ing for more than six weeks with the greatest patience and persistence to the C.
C.
as a whole and to its individual members.
Now the decisive moment had come when the C.
C.
had to show its political leadership of the Party to the full.
On the day after the close of the session of the Council, Lenin, in the letter which is here printed, placed an ultimatum before the C.
C.
: either the immediate convocation of a congress, or the resignation of the whole C.
C.

? The C.

left Lenins ques­ tion unanswered.
Six weeks later, after Lenin and Lengnik had repeated their question, the C.

In the middle of February a letter arrived from L.
E.
Halperin who, like V.
A.
Noskov, was very conciliatory towards the minority.
The letter reflected this state of mind and his negative at­ titude to the idea of calling a congress.
Lenin, who knew that this was not merely the personal mood or the personal view of one member of the C.
C.
but the opinion of a whole group of influential members, at once replied to Halperin’s letter by the letter to the members of the C.

(and in the Second International) which was taken by Lenin and by the Party, as Comrade Stalin has said, “approximately in 1903-04.
” In his “Letter to the German Communists” written in 1921 (after the Third Con­ gress of the Comintern), Lenin advances, as one of the principal causes of the defeat of the German proletariat in the revolutionary crisis of 1918-20, the fact that “at the time of the crisis the German workers found themselves without a really revolutionary (party, because they had not brought about a split in time, because of the pressure of the accursed tradition of ‘unity’ with the venal (Scheidemann, Legien, David and Co.
) and spineless (Kautsky, Hilferding and Co.
) gang of lackeys of capitalism.
” (Collected IForks, Russian ed.
, Vol.
XXVI, pp.
485-86.
) On the other hand, one of the principal conditions of the victory of the pro­ letariat in Russia in 1917 was, Lenin believed, the fact that “Bolshevism, as a trend of political thought and as a political party, exists since 1903,” and that having arisen at that date on “this granite theoretical foundation” of Marxian theory, it “passed through fifteen years (1903-17) of practical history which, in wealth of experience, has had no equal anywhere else in the world.
” The “fifteen years of practical history” that Bolshevism had gone through resulted in the victory of the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia.
And the experience of this dictatorship “has clearly shown,” says Lenin, “.
.
.
that absolute centralisation and the strictest discipline of the proletariat are one of the basic conditions for victory over the bour­ geoisie.
” “Only the history of Bolshevism during the whole period of its existence,” Lenin goes on to say, “can satisfactorily explain why it was able to build up and maintain, under most difficult conditions, the iron discipline necessary for the victory of the proletariat.
” (“Le/t-JFing” Communism, an Infantile Disorder).
The history of the split in the R.
S.
D.
L.
P, at and after the Second Congress is one of the first stages in this history of Bolshevism during the whole period of its existence.
It was at this stage of its history that Bolshevism arose on the granite found­ ation of Marxian theory as “a new type” of party, based on “absolute centralisation and the most rigorous discipline,” to become later on a world force which led the proletariat of Russia to victory and is leading the international proletariat to victory.
One Step Forward, Two Steps Back gives us a masterly analysis of this stage in the develop­ ment of Bolshevism, of the fight for “a new type” of party against opportunism; it thus gives the grounds for Lenin’s line towards a breach with opportunism, and show’s us the tactics he pursued in this struggle.
The pamphlet was received with hostility not only by those oppor­ tunists against whom it was directly aimed, the Mensheviks, but also by the opportunists in Europe represented by the leading centrist groups of the German Social-Democratic Party and of the Second International (Kautsky, etc.
).
The Left wing of the German Party also took part in this campaign against the nascent Bolshevik Party and its leader, Lenin.
As Comrade Stalin writes: “The Left-wing Social-Democrats in Germany, Parvus and Rosa Luxemburg, then the leaders of the Left wing, also intervened [in the controversy—Ed.
], And what happened? Both came out against the Bolsheviks.
At the same time the Bolsheviks were accused of betraying ultra-centrist and Blanquist tendencies.
Later, these vulgar and philistine epithets were caught up by the Mensheviks and spread throughout the world.
** (Stalin, Leninism, 1933, Vol.
Il, P.

) The main attacks of the Mensheviks, of the centrists and of the Left wing of the Second International were directed against the organisational principles of Bolshevism, i.
e.
, against the building up of “a new type” of party that would be based on that “absolute centralisation and most rigorous discipline” which according to Lenin “is one of the fundamental conditions for victory over the bourgeoisie,’* and, as it was at that time, over tsarist autocracy.
Of all the opportunists who attacked Lenin and the Bolsheviks, Trotsky (at that time one of the leaders of Menshevism and a member of the leading body of their faction) particularly distin­ guished himself by his lack of political principle and by the slanderous nature of his attacks on Lenin in a pamphlet he published at the time, entitled Our Political Tasks.
In substance, Trotsky merely played a varia­ tion of the tune of his master, P.
B.
Axelrod, who had attacked Lenin and the Bolsheviks in a number of articles which appeared in the new, Menshevik Iskra and which were permeated with opportunism in matters of organisation and theory.
It is in the writings of Axelrod and Trotsky that we find organisational opportunism most blatantly combined with op­ portunism in questions of policy, strategy and tactics, and it is in their writings that we see Menshevism growing, as was pointed out by Lenin, into a Russian reformist party.
The same organisational opportunism is displayed in Kautsky’s writings againt Lenin and the Bolsheviks.
Kautsky, who supported the organisational views ' of the Mensheviks, rejected Lenin’s “absolute centralisation” and, like the Mensheviks, held Lenin en­ tirely responsible for the split in the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
Rosa Luxmburg’s posi­ tion was the same position of organisational opportunism.
A long article by her, entitled “Organisational Questions in the Russian Social-Dem­ ocratic Party,” appeared simultaneously in Die Neue 7*it {The New Times), the theoretical organ of the German Party, and in the Menshevik Iskra, No.
69.
In this article she accused Lenin and the Bolsheviks of conspirative centralism, of “mechanically transplanting” the organisational principles of “Blanquism” to the Russian Social-Democratic Party, etc.
, etc.
Like the Economists, who had advocated the “tactics-process” as against Lenin’s “tactics-plan,” she advanced the conception of the “organi-galion-process,” denying the need of any organisational plan for the build' ing up of a proletarian party.
In reply to Rosa Luxemburg, Lenin wrote an article, which bore the same title as the pamphlet: “One Step Forward, Two Steps Back” (Collected Works, Russian ed.
, Vol.
XXX, pp.
88-97), with the intention of having it published in the German Social-Democratic press and thus of bringing before the workers of Western Europe the real truth about the split in the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
and the real nature of the fight of the majority against the minority as a fight against opportunism.
But the leading cir­ cles of the German Party, represented by Kautsky, did not permit the publication of Lenin’s article.
Not only that, besides refusing to admit Lenin and the Bolsheviks to the columns of their paper and encouraging the defence of the Menshevik positions, these leading circles made an attempt formally to take the Mensheviks under their protection by pro­ posing arbitration.
This would have caused Bolshevism to become ab­ sorbed by Menshevism under the guise of restoring the unity of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
This was the object of the letter addressed in February 1905 by Bebel to Lenin in which he, in the name of the German Party, pro­ posed arbitration.
Lenin and the Bureau of the Committees of the Ma­ jority which had been formed by that time wTith the object of calling the Third Congress, in a letter to Bebel dated February 7, 1905, declined the proposal, giving as their reason the impossibility of taking the responsi­ bility for any important new steps that might commit the Party as a whole without a decision of a Party congress.
At the same time Lenin sent the leadership of the German Party a copy of the reply he had sent to the Swiss Social-Democratic leader, Greulich, which he had been charged to write by the editorial board of the Bolshevik paper V peryod and which gave an account “of how and why the split in the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
has by this time become a fact.
” This reply to Greulich who had informed the editors of Vperyod that he had suggested to the leadership of the German Party that it decide the question of the split in the R.
S.
D.
L.
P, “by inter­ national action” was another attempt on the part of I^nin to inform the workers of Western Europe of the true causes of the split and the true nature of the fight between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks.
Besides being sent to the leadership of the German Party, the reply to Greulich was printed in Russian in Geneva.
In the preface Lenin made an appeal on behalf of Vperyod “to all the friends of Vperyod outside Russia” to translate the letter into the language of the country they live in and to bring it to the notice of “the largest possible number of foreign Social-Democrats.
” Thus, Lenin tried to make the fight against opportunism, and the line for a rupture with it, which the newly bom, revolutionary, Bolshevik Party of Russia was pursuing, an international question, and it did indeed acquire tremendous international historical importance.

* The Byelostok Conference was called in March 1902 on the initiative of the League of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, which was controlled by the Economists and their supporters, the Bund.

and to paralyse the growing influence of Iskra.
But so few delegates came that, on the insistence of the representative of Iskra (F.
L Dan), it was decided not to call the gathering a congress but a conference.
The organisations represented at the Conference were: the League of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, the Foreign Committee of the Bund, the GC.
of the Bund in Russia, the St.
Petersburg and the Ekaterinoslav Committees, Yuzhny Rabochy and the editorial board of Iskra.
The Conference endorsed the May Day Manifesto and elected an organisation committee (which was subsequently dissolved and was re­ formed at the Pskov Conference in January 1903).
Dan, the delegate of Iskra, acted at the Conference in accordance with instructions he had received from the editorial board, primarily from Lenin.

was Plekhanov.
In his concluding speech after the discussion of the report of the Organisation Committee for convening the Congress, he said: “So all the preliminary work of the Congress has been performed.
The Congress is fully constituted, its decisions are absolutely binding on the whole Party and cancel whatever decisions of the First Congress they may be in contradiction with/’ This statement was greeted with ap­ plause by the whole Congress, but this did not prevent the Mensheviks, with Martov at their head, from starting a campaign against the deci­ sions of the Congress as soon as it became apparent that, as regards the constitution of the central bodies of the Party, the majority of the Congress had rallied to the organisational proposals of Lenin.
Neither did it prevent the chairman himself from going over to the side of the Menshevik disrupters and opportunists.
Page 425* The Voronezh Committee, which was under Economist influ­ ence, had taken up a strongly anti-fsfcra-ist attitude long before the Second Congress.
When the O.
Q was formed with the object of calling the Congress, the Voronezh Committee was the only one of the local organisations to start violent attacks on Iskra and on the O.
C.
Iskra sternly rebuffed the Voronezh Economists (in No.
36).
The Voronezh Committee was not invited to send delegates to the Congress because it was a vacillating organisation, openly hostile to the objects pursued by the calling of the Party Congress.
Lenin again spoke of the Voronezh Committee in connection with the situation after the Congress.

* “What Should Not Be Done?” by Plekhanov appeared in Iskra, No.
52, of November 20 (7), 1903.
In this article Plekhanov still makes an effort to remain “neutral” towards the two adversaries, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, but he virtually defends the Mensheviks and makes a concealed attack upon Lenin.
In one of the chapters of the present pamphlet (“Small Unpleasantnesses Should Not Stand in the Way of Great Enjoyments,” omitted in the present edition) Lenin says that the “central idea of ‘What Should Not Be Done?* is that in politics one should not be straightforward, nor unduly outspoken, nor unduly intransigent, that sometimes, in order to prevent a split, one must even give in to the revisionists.
” In his letter giving his reasons for resigning from the editorial board of Iskra (in this volume), Lenin refutes the concealed charges made against him of undue acerbity, etc.
, and emphasises the necessity of casting off the traditions of sectarianism, of the circle spirit and of family habits; he demands the public discus­ sion of the principles of the disagreement in the Party, because it is a crime to gloss over dissensions of principle, thus concealing them from the Party.
Lenin connects the question with that of the role and-mutual relations of leaders and masses, emphasising the enormous role of Party leaders and showing the complicated conditions for training them.
Pace 434.
* The reference is to Martov’s article in Iskra, No.
62, “Is This the Right Way to Prepare?” in which Martov attacks the Bol­ shevik slogans concerning the necessity of building and consolidating an underground Party organisation and the necessity of carefully preparing for insurrection.
From the Mensheviks* point of view, preparing for in­ surrection with the aid of a secret proletarian party was Blanquism and the adoption of conspirative methods.
Martov wrote: “The more the understanding of the current political tasks of our Party becomes nar­ rowed in the minds of some comrades, and the more they are inclined in practice to put up passively with the ‘poverty and imperfection* of our day-to-day work and of its astounding backwardness—by no means less astounding than in the days of Economism—as con>pared with the demands put forth by the spontaneously insurgent masses, the more ex­ clusively are their thoughts directed towards that luminous point which they visualise as an insurrection manufactured by them in the under­ ground of a ‘strictly secret organisation* and ‘set in motion by order of an all-powerful centre.
* ’* This Menshevik gibe at the idea of a leading centre and of a secret organisation obviously grows into an opportunist estimation of the nature of the approaching revolution and into rejection of the idea of proletarian insurrection.
Pace 436.
* Lenin quotes the reply of the editors of the Menshevik Iskra to the letter from Alexandrov (Olminsky), “Organisational Problems,’* which appeared as a supplement to Iskra, No.
56, for January 1904.
Olminsky*s letter was directed against the Mensheviks and in defence of the organisational principles of the Bolsheviks.
Ue regarded the Mensheviks’ rejection of obedience to Party discipline as aristocratic anarchism and the encouragement of circle habits.
The editors' reply was written by Plekhanov and took the form of commentaries on the letter.
Plekhanov fully endorsed Axelrod*s attitude towards Bolshevism and ended his commentary by saying that Olminsky’s letter “is the best confirmation of Axelrod’s contention of the bureaucratic centralism of the majority.
” Pace 439.
* The reference is to Martov’s article, “The Awakening of Dem­ ocracy and Our Tasks,’’ in Iskra, No.
58, February 7 (January 25), 1904.
The central idea of the article was that the proletariat was not yet suf­ ficiently conscious of itself as a class, that it lacked a proletarian party of its own and could not yet assume the hegemony in the revolution.
Martov emphasised that a “Social-Democratic policy of the working class is not the same thing as the policy of the proletariat led by persons with Social-Democratic convictions.
’* In other words, he followed Axelrod in describing the R.
S.
D.
L.
P, as a group of intellectuals who are political friends and who merely try to carry out a Social-Democratic policy.
“By itself the R.
S.

” Pace 443.
* The reference is to “A Letter to a Comrade on Our Organi­ sational Tasks’ by Lenin, written in September 1902 in answer to a letter from Shneyerson who had proposed a plan for the organisation of Social-Democratic work in St.
Petersburg.
Lenin’s letter appeared in pamphlet form and was widely circulated throughout Russia.
It contained a condensed exposition of the organisational ideas of IF hat Is To Be Done?.
Subsequently, at the end of 1903 (November-December), Lenin wrote a preface to the pamphlet in which he polemises against the Mensheviks.
Pace 447.
* This refers to Martov’s article in Iskra* No.
60, “The Next Thing,” in which Martov defended the Moscow Mensheviks who pro­ claimed invalid the decision of the Moscow Committee of the Party re­ cognising the authority of the C.
C.
of the Party (point 9 of the rules) in all questions pertaining to the appointment, expulsion or transfer of 36 Lenin 11 members of the Moscow Committee.
Martov and the Moscow Mensheviks insisted on the complete independence of the local committee in these matters, thus undermining completely the principle of the unity of Party leadership and dragging the Party back to a former stage when it was no more than a scattered organisation of isolated circles.

* The Dresden Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party met in September 1903.
It had been preceded by a prolonged discussion between the revisionists and those who were then called the orthodox Marxists.
The revisionists, with Bernstein at their head, were defeated and their views were condemned by the Congress.

This “Constitution” is a satire on Lenin’s “regime” in the Party and describes the leading members of the Party centres as the “bullies,” who possess all rights, and the rank and file of the Party as the “bullied,” who are devoid of all righte.
This caricature of Lenin’s Bolshevik principles in the matter of organ­ isation was intended to discredit the Bolsheviks and especially Lenin him­ self in the eyes of the Party masses.
But the attempt met with a decided rebuff on the part of the Party organisations in Russia, and even called forth the protest of the printers of the press where the Menshevik Iskra was printed.

* From the moment he started his campaign for the calling of a special congress, Lenin was confronted with the conciliatory attitude of a number of members of the C.
C.
Regarding this attitude as a bona fide error, Lenin devoted much time and effort to trying to overcome it.
In his letters to members of the C.
C.
he repeatedly tried to make them see the harmfulness of their position.
He tried to convince them of the necessity of calling a congress, as the only radical method at the disposal of the Party against the disorganising and disruptive influence that had been brought into the Party by the minority.
In spite of all these efforts, the conciliatory section of the members of the GC.
—the most active and forward of whom was V.
A.
Noskov—passed by degrees from passive resistance to Lenin’s agitation to an undisguised fight against Lenin’s line, and to the support of an unprincipled conciliation with the minority at any price.
In February the section of the C.
C.
in Russia, by a majority of five to one of the members then present in Rus­ sia, ipronounccd itself against convening a congress.
Then, somewhat later, the Central Committee, consisting of five members, passed a vote of cen­ sure on Lenin for agitating in favour of convening a congress.
Finally, at what is known as the “July” meeting three members who supported the conciliatory line (Noskov, Krassin and Halperin) carried out a re­ gular coup d'état inside the C.
C.
; taking advantage of the arrests of some and of the resignation of other members of the Central Committee and seizing on the fact that one of the members was temporarily working as a member of the St.
Petersburg Committee, they unseated five of the members of the C.
C.
(Lengnik, Zemlyachka, Krzhizhanovsky, Gusarov and Essen) and co-opted three new members, all of them “conciliators,” to replace them.
I>enin was deprived of the power to represent the C.
C.
abroad, and special powers were given to Noskov.
A decision was adopted to bring about a conciliation with the minority at all cost.
At the end of August, V.
A.
Noskov arrived from Russia with the ob­ ject of carrying out the decisions of the C.
C.
Trenin protested against all decisions taken by a C.
C.
consisting of only three members.
He was away from Geneva at the time and for two or three weeks he carried on a correspondence with Noskov on the «subject of these de­ cisions and of the conflict inside the C.
C.
The letter which is repro­ duced here is the final stage of this correspondence.
It contains Lenin’s estimation nf the conciliationism of Noskov and his adherents in the C.
C.
as the most unprincipled opportunism.
The letter announced Lenin’s rupture with Noskov personally and with the C.
C.
After this Lenin, as the leader of the Committees of the Majority, carried on an open cam­ paign for a third congress in opposition to all the central bodies of the Party, which had passed over to the minority and openly trampled upon the clear and explicit decisions of the Second Congress.
Pace 467.
’* The agreement of the three members of the C.
C.
abroad con­ cluded June 8 (May 26), 1904, was an agreement between Lenin and Noskov who had arrived from Russia to represent the C.
C.
abroad and to act as second delegate of the C.
C.
in the Council of the Party in place of F.
V.
Lengnik who returned to Russia.
The agreement registered the decided difference between Noskov and Lenin on the question of calling a congress, and recorded their undertaking to “abstain from acting in any matter officially in the name of the C.
C.
except with their mutual consent and over their joint signature” until the final settlement of the differences in the C.

was formed iu the beginning of 1904.
It consisted of agents of the C.
C.
, including V.
V.
Vorovsky, I.
H.
Lalayants, and P.
I.
Kulyabko, all of them staunch supporters of the majority.
The Southern Bureau had its headquarters in Odessa and united the three southern committees of Odessa, Nikolayev and Ekateri noslav.
These committees and the Southern Bureau were definitely on th<* side of Lenin and the majority and carried on active agitation for a congress.
The C.
C.
at its “July meeting” (see note to page 467*), three members only being present, decided “to dissolve the Southern Bureau of the C.
C.
in view of the fact that its work is not in agreement with that of the C.
C.
” Page 472.
** The decision to hold a conference of representatives of the C.
C.
with representatives of the minority was also adopted by the C.
C.
nt the “July meeting.
” The conference took place in Russia in October 1904, two representatives of the C.
C.
(L.
E.
Halperin and I.
F.
Dubrovin-sky) and two of the minority (V.
N.
Krokhmall and V.
N.
Rozanov) being present.
Among other measures of conciliation the C.
C.
proposed that three members of the minority be co-opted to the C.
C.
The represent­ atives of the minority accepted the proposal.
These two representatives and R.

* Owing to the growing revolutionary ferment in the country (the unrest among the peasantry in 1902 and the mass workers’ strikes in 1903), and also the growing temper of opposition among the bour­ geoisie and the liberal aristocracy, the government found itself compelled to make certain slight concessions to the moderate elements in society.
After the assassination of the Minister of the Interior, Plehve, Prince P.
D.
Svyatoipoik-Mirsky, who proclaimed that he was “we'll disposed” and “trustful towards society,” was appointed to take his place (Sept­ ember 1904).
The censorship of the press was made a little less strict and a number of Zemstvo liberals were recalled from exile.
Of course these concessions were insignificant; for example, permission to hold a Zemstvo congress was given, but that permission was withdrawn five days before the congress was to have convened.
The more moderate of the Zemstvo liberals believed that the new “liberal” policy of the govern­ ment created the conditions in which co-operation with the government would be possible, but the more radical section, members of the Osvo-bozhdeniye group, led by Struve, continued to demand a constitution, freedom of coalition for liberals, especially those engaged in the liberal professions.
The Zemstvo liberals gave expression to these demands at the ordinary meetings of the gubernia Zemstvo assemblies.
Needless to say, in spite of their “radicalism” the Zemstvo liberals were opposed to revolutionary methods of struggle and recognised only “peaceful means of lawful struggle for rights.
” ' This “liberal” era did not last long.
In December 1904, the tsar is­ sued an order prohibiting the Zemstvo assemblies from discussing polit­ ical questions, as the order declared, “for the discussion of which they are not legally authorised.
” The peremptory order of the tsar, the wave of patriotism that swept over the bourgeoisie in connection with the Russo-Japanese War and, above all perhaps, their fear of the labour movement (after the events of Bloody Sunday, January 9, 1905), soon put an end to the Zemstvo “opposition.
” The “Zemstvo campaign” re­ vealed the complete political impotence of the liberals.
It was in these circumstances that the Menshevik editorial board of Iskra, in November 1904, published its “Letter to Party Organisations,” which dealt with the Zemstvo campaign.
In this letter the Mensheviks greatly exaggerated the determination of the liberals and their ability to fight for a constitution.
The letter declared that the Zemstvo radicals “are busily engaged in preparing for a demonstration in favour of a constitution at the meetings of the gubernia Zemstvo assemblies.
” In­ stead of exposing the political impotence and cowardice of the Zemstvo liberals, the Mensheviks wrote: “By coming out officially against absolut­ ism and by putting to it demands which, if satisfied, would help to abolish it, they in fact have become our allies (of course, in a very re­ lative sense), although not sufficiently determined in their actions and not sufficiently democratic in their aims.
” Further on it wrote: “Our attitude towards the liberal bourgeoisie is determined by the task of imbuing it with greater courage and of in­ ducing it to associate itself with the demands which the proletariat, guided by Social-Democracy, puts forward.
We would, however, commit a fatal error if we set ourselves the aim, by means of energetic meas­ ures of intimidation, of compelling the Zemstvo, or any other organs of bourgeois opposition immediately, under the influence of panic, to make a formal promise to present our demands to the government.
Such tactics would only discredit Social-Democracy, for they would con­ vert the whole of our political campaign into a lever of reaction.
” Thus, the Mensheviks practically abandoned all right to criticise and expose liberalism and said the same things that were said by the liberals, even by the Right represented by Novoye Vremya (New Times).
The Men­ sheviks not only overestimated the liberals as allies, but even capit­ ulated to them.
The thing they feared most was that the proletariat would frighten, the bourgeoisie by too vigorous action and that it would put forward demands that would not be acceptable to the liberals.
The Mensheviks acted in accordance with their view that the proletariat and its party are not the vanguard in the struggle against the autocracy.
Thus, the “Letter” very strikingly revealed the profound difference in the prin­ ciples of Menshcvism and Bolshevism.
The article given here deals in detail with the principles of the Mensheviks and of Iskra and of their “plan for a Zemstvo campaign.
” This article helped very considerably to formulate Bolshevik tactics and to explain them to the mass of the members of the Party.

* The National-Liberal Party was the party of the German indus­ trial bourgeoisie (formed in 1866) the object of which was the unification of Germany under the leadership of Prussia.
Germany at that time was split up into a multitude of separate petty states and principalities, which was a great hindrance to the economic development of the country.
To the extent that the National-Liberals wished to unite the country they expressed the interests of the economic and political development of the country in general.
But they wished to obtain unity by subjecting the small states to Prussia, which was dominated by the Junkers (landlords), and with this object in view they gave their support to the reactionary policy of the Prussian government (Bismarck) which was bringing about this union with the aid of blood and iron.
And to that extent the Na­ tional-Liberals were the active assistants of Prussian reaction.

* The strike at the central railway workshops at Rostov-on-Don started on November 17 (4), 1902.
In an article, “New Events and Old Problems” (Collected Works, Russian ed.
.
Vol.
V, pp.
206-10), Lenin speaks in the following terms of this strike, which indicated that the movement was passing to new forms and new methods of struggle: “Af­ fecting many thousands of workers, the strike, which began with de­ mands of a purely economic character, soon becomes a political event.
.
.
.
Crowds numbering, according to the evidence of eye witnes­ ses, up to twenty and thirty thousand people, hold political meetings which are remarkably serious and organised, where Social-Democratic manifestoes are eagerly read and commented on, political speeches are made, the elementary truths of socialism and of the political struggle are explained.
.
.
.
The administration and the police lose their heads .
.
.
and for several days they are powerless to prevent open-air mass polit­ ical meetings of a nature unprecedented in Russia.
And when ultimately the armed forces are called out, the crowd puts up a desperate resist­ ance and the death of a comrade becomes, on the next day, the occasion for a political demonstration over his body.
The Don Committee was a thousand times right when, in a manifesto, it spoke of the Rostov strike as one of the preliminaries to the general rising of the Russian work­ ers under the slogan of political liberty.
Events like these glaringly show that a general armed insurrection against the tsarist government is matur­ ing not only as an idea in the minds and programmes of revolution­ aries, but as the inevitable, practical and natural, next step of the move­ ment itself, as the result of the growing fearlessness of the masses, who are receiving such valuable lessons, such a splendid education from Rus­ sian reality.

* This refers to the Russo-Japanese War.
This war was called forth by the predatory’ policy of the tsarist government in the Far East As early as the ’nineties the Romanov government began openly to seize new territories in the Far East in the interests of the landlords and capitalists.
In 1896, Russia occupied Port Arthur.
In 1901, during the Boxer Rebellion, Russian troops occupied Manchuria.
At the same time the tsarist government openly began to make preparations to seize Korea.
On this question, as well as on that of Manchuria, Russia came into conflict with Japan, who was planning to gain possession of Korea herself.
Japan was supported by England and the United States who were opposed to the spread of Russian influence in Manchuria.
Meanwhile, the revolutionary movement in Russia was growing, and even the most cautious servants of the tsar, for example Witte, began to look upon a “victorious little war” with Japan as a means of side-tracking the masses from the revolution.
Convinced that she was fully prepared for war, Japan, in February 1904, commenced military operations by an at­ tack on the Russian fleet in Port Arthur.
In August 1904, the Russian forces, commanded by General Kuropat­ kin, suffered a heavy defeat at Liaoyang, and on January 2, 1905, Port Arthur was surrendered to the Japanese.
After the severe defeat at Muk­ den in March, in which nearly half the army was lost, and the rout of the Russian fleet in the naval battle off Tsusima, Russia, in August 1905, was compelled to sign the Portsmouth Treaty by which she sur­ rendered Port Arthur, Port Dalny (now Dairen) and the southern part of the island of Sakhalin to Japan.
The defeat in the Russo-Japanese War had considerable effect in ac­ celerating the development of revolutionary events in Russia in 1905, for it glaringly revealed the weakness of the tsarist monarchy, the in­ competence of its servants and the corruption of its officials.
Every new defeat suffered by the Russian forces in the war caused a fresh outburst of indignation, and even among the moderate liberals it roused the desire for the defeat of the tsarist government.

Issue No.
39 for 1904 contained an article by Eugene Trubetskoy, “The War and the Bureaucracy.
” Trubetskoy complained of the reactionary policy of the Russian bureaucracy, which he said helped to strengthen the activity of the “extremist” parties.
“While persons of moderate views have to remain silent, unable to express their views in the legal press, illegal leaflets inundate the streets and their influence .
.
.
grows every day.
” Trying to frighten the government with the prospect of the growing “interior danger” of the extremist revolutionary parties, Trubetskoy called on the bureaucracy to have “confidence” in the moderate elements of “society” and to unite with “society” in serving common aims.
The bureaucracy “must not be the master of a speechless herd, but the in­ strument of a throne that has the support of society.
.
.
.
Then we need dread no enemy either abroad or at home.
” Thus wrote Trubetskoy, promising the “throne” the full support of “society,” i.
e.
, the liberals, as soon as their modest demands were satisfied.
