As one might expect, Engels increasingly directed his thoughts to the prospects for and future of the struggle for working-class emancipation and to the ways and means of achieving its short-term and long-term goals; this is reflected in his numerous letters.
His ideas on these issues were neither the result of abstract argument, nor were they the merely th eoretical calculations of an academic isolated from the real world.
To the e nd of his life, Engels maintained close contacts with the leaders of socialist parties in various European countries, with followers of Marx, with young scholars who showed an interest in his theoretical works and in Marxism, willingly sharing with them his views and ideas.
A determined opponent of dogmatising, Engels revised many former concepts regarding forms and methods of proletarian struggle for workers’ rights and a radical reformation of society in the light of history and the major changes taking place in his own da y.
Himself an eye-witness of the first steps taken by an independent working-class movement, and an active participant in this movement for almost fifty years, he was well xv began to anticipate the emergence in the near future of a mass political party of the English working class.
The viability of the new International, which had emerged in the wake of the 1889 International Congress in Paris, had been proved by the enthusiastic response to its appeal for May Day demonstrations to campaign for an 8-hour working day.
Hundreds of thousands of people were now taking pa rt in these demonstrations every year.
All these events inspired Engels with optimism.
If the working-class movement in the major countries of Eur ope continued to develop at this rate and along these same lines, then he be lieved this might accelerate the crisis of the capitalist system.
‘The growth of the proletarian movement in all countries’, he wrote to Bebel in October 1893, ‘is about to precipitate a crisis .
.
.
which may not be upon us for some five or six years yet.
’ This optimism was further strengthened, as letters published in this volume (pp.
172-189) reveal, by his trip to Europe in the summer of 1893, in the course of which he visited Vienna, Berlin and Prague , and attended the final session of the International Socialist Congress in Zurich.
Engels’s belief that the capitalist system—at least in Europe, to which his statements on this subject are invari ably restricted—would collapse in the relatively near future was based not only on the success of the proletarian movement, but also on his theoretical analysis of new phenomena and trends in capitalist economics.
In 1891, in hi s critique of the draft of the new programme of the German Social-Democratic Party, Engels letters, Engels identified individual cases of corruption involving a number of prominent politicians in France, Italy and elsewhere as symptoms revealing the general inability of the bourgeois st ate to discharge its functions, as indications that the existing social or der was on the verge of collapse.
‘.
.
.
there is nothing stable about France .
.
.
a cr isis of the first water in Italy.
.
.
—he wrote to F.
A.
Sorge on January 16, 1895, ‘in short, things are growing critical throughout the whole of Europe’ (p.
424).
This crisis of bourgeois society, a crisis which Engels believed to be imminent, would also be the result, in his opinion, of the intensifying economic conflict among the major capitalist countries, caused in part by the emergence of the USA onto the world market.
Developing this idea in a letter to N.
F.
Danielson, dated 24 February 1893, Engels wrote that economic rivalry between the USA on the one hand, and England, France and Germany on the other, could only mean that ‘the crisis must come, tout ce qu’ il y a de plus fin de siècle’ (p.
111).
Clearly Engels supposed that this rivalry would provoke an acute economic crisis which would spread to the political and social spheres, and that this might well create the prerequisite conditions for the collapse of the capitalist system, a collapse which, so he believed, would occur not automatically, but as a result of the energetic actions of the working class.
In Decem ber 1894, he wrote to P.
Lavrov, ‘.
.
.
the whole of Europe is warming up, crises are brewing everywhere, particularly in Russia’ (p.
389).
Three months later, in a let- the same time he believed it very likely that ‘if it does not bring the final victory, it will nevertheless make that victory a foregone conclusion’ (p.
175).
As we now know, these prognostications were not fulfilled.
However, this does not mean that they had no real basis.
That his arguments were not groundless, and that he had accurately noted the trends is shown by the major events which marked the first decades of the 20th century.
On 8 February 1895, Engels wrote to G.
V.
Plekhanov: And when the devil of the revolution has someone at his collar, then he has Nicholas II ’ (p.
440).
Indeed, ten years later, a popular revolution developed in the Russian Empire, and if it was not then victorious, it nonetheless shook the foundations of the autocracy and made a profound impact on other countries, particularly in the East.
Engels often expressed the idea that the approaching war would be pan-European, and twenty years later that war broke out.
However, his main prognosis concerning the imminent collapse of capitalism proved invalid, and not only as regards the timing.
Having recognised that his and Marx’s hopes that the proletariat would be victorious as early as the mid-19th century (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
533) were mistaken, Engels nonetheless remained captive to such illusions, believing that capitalism had already exhausted its potential by the end of the century, and that conditions were ripe for the emergence of new social relations.
His postulates that the latest economic crisis would bring with it the collapse of bourgeois society, that capitalism had outlived actively involved were no longer applicable : ‘The era of barricades and street fighting has gone for good; if the military fight, resistance becomes madness.
Hence the necessity to find new revolutionary tactics, (see this volume, p.
21) he wrote to Lafargue in November 1892.
At the same time—and most importantly—by the 1890s the working class in the majority of European countries had much greater opportunity to use legal methods thanks to the emergence, albeit in differing forms, of parliamentary government.
Here Engels attributed the main role to parliamentary activity by the socialists, and to universal suffrage.
He did so ba sing himself on the experience of the German Social-Democratic Party, whose practical activity d eeply influenced his thinking.
A number of Engels’s letters (to Victor Adler on 11 October, to August Bebel on 12 October, and on 18 October 1893) contain ideas which received their final formulati on in Engels’s last work, Introduction to Karl Marx’s ‘The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850’.
Emphasising the importance of the campaign for universal suffrage then being mounted in Belgium and Austria, he wrote to August Bebel: ‘The suffrage movement won its first victory in Belgium, and now Austria is about to follow suit.
At the outset this will ensure the survival of universal suffrage, but also encourage us to make further demands—in Germany no less than in France and Italy’ (p.
206).
In another letter to Bebel he again emphasises the importance of legal methods of proletarian struggle, arguing that ‘governments are again coming under the control of a living political movement among the by using exclusively ‘legal’ methods, strengthened his view that universal suffrage and other legal methods now made it possible for the working class to win political power by peaceful means.
He anticipated, however, preventive actions by reactionary forces.
Such counter-measures must, in his opinion, inevitably involve the violati on of constitutional rights and the open use of force.
This, in its turn, might compel the masses to offer direct resistance, that is, to attempt to seize power by force, by the use of arms.
In other words, Engels did not exclude the possibility of using such methods, but only in response to coercive action by the ruling circles.
‘Where there is no reactionary power to be overthrow n’, he wrote to Bebel on 7 October 1892, ‘there can be no question whatever of revolutionary power (p.
8).
He developed this same idea further in a letter to Lafargue a month later: ‘It’s even ten to one that universal suffrage, intelligently used by the workers, will drive the rulers to overthrow legality, that is, to put us in the most favourable position to make the revolution’ (p.
29).
Nonetheless he continues to see any attempt at armed uprising as foredoomed if the ruling circles still command the armed forces.
He did not, it is true, exclude the possibility that in Germany, the army might become ‘ 1/3 — 2/5 socialist’ (p.
225) as a result of the growing influence of the Social-Democratic Party in the countryside, which provided the bulk of army recruits.
However, as many of his letters show, he hoped in the main that the current situation would enable the socialists to become the parliamentary majority, and thus implement their immediate goals.
demonstrating the success of the socialists and their practical activity, the struggle of the popular masses to extend democratic freedoms, strikes and other worker demonstrations in support of their economic demands.
These letters illustrate Engels’s deep interest in internal party issues, and especially in the larger and more influential parties.
In Germany these issues concerned relations between the Marxist core of the party leadership and reformist elements, particularly in matters relating to the party programme, and also to parliamentary tactics; in France the main issues were solidarity among socialist forces, ways and means of cr eating a single socialist party, and the role and tactics of ‘the workers’ movement in this process; in England the issues were the creation of a mass independent party of the working class, the role of existing socialist organisations in this process, their mutual relations, and also the need to support the trade unions in their desire to take an active part in the international socialist workers’ movement; in Italy the main issue was that of strengthening, both organisationally and ideologically, the young socialist party, etc.
In a number of letters Engels expressed his views on the state of and pros- pects for the socialist movement in the USA.
He saw the sources of its weak- ness as lying not so much in the sectarian line being pursued by the Socialist workers’ Party, the bulk of whose membership was made up of German immi- grants, as in objective circumstances, wh ich created ‘considerable and peculiar difficulties to the steady growth of a labour party’ (p.
236).
Social-Democrats (p.
154), about the state of affairs in English socialist organisations (pp.
342-44).
He inform s Bebel about the English miners’ strike (pp.
204-5), with Sorge he sh ares his views on the activities of the French Workers’ Party (p.
249), on the po litical situation in England (pp.
81, 229), and on the battle among various tr ends within the German Social- Democratic Party (pp.
141-42).
Almost every event of any significance in the European workers’ movement between 1893 and 1895 is reflected to some degree or other in his letters of this period.
The material published in this volume shows that Engels continued his contacts with Russian socialists, revealing a lively interest in the situation in Russia.
Having analysed the situation in the country, he posited that it might soon become the arena of revolutionary events.
How well Engels knew the situation in Russia is revealed by his letter to N.
F.
Danielson, who translated Das Kapitalmto Russian and with whom he corresponded for many years, up to the end of his life.
In a letter written on 24 February 1893, Engels noted the acute social contradictions, in this country with a huge peasant population, where, as a result of the rapid if belated, development of capitalism, the crisis might prove .
.
.
mo re powerful and acute than anywhere else (p.
112).
Together with an analysis of the current state of affairs in the proletarian liberation struggle in various countries and its future prospects, Engels’s letters also contain his assessment of and ideas on the consolidation and development of international proletarian links, the activities of Engels supported the widest possible participation in international socialist congresses by working-class organisations, including those which did not pursue socialist aims.
‘These groups’, he wrote to Turati on 16 August 1894, ‘by the very fact of attending our congresses, are unconsciously drawn into the socialist lap’ (p.
341).
Not believing himself to have the right to interfere in the activities of socialist parties, Engels limited himself to advice and recommendations, and even these he sent only to those closest to him, to whom he was able to say unpalatable things with perfect frankness.
To Bebel, Liebknecht, Kautsky, Paul and Laura Lafargue, Adler, Sorge and others with whom he regularly corresponded, he gave his evaluati ons and expressed his criticisms, occasionally in quite sharp, and in some cases perhaps not altogether objective terms.
However, this was not intended for the eyes of others, nor, of course, was it seen by either writer or reader as some infallible truth.
Indeed, many optimistic prognostications and hopes were not intended for publication at all, were often coloured with emotion, and in many cases cannot be viewed as the result of any precise or detailed analysis.
The case is very different when it comes to letters written to people with whom Engels was little acquainted, often in reply to direct theoretical questions, or containing theoretical criticism of a particular economic, philosophical or historical work, or outspoken polemics with 1893; to W.
Sombart, 11 March, and to Conrad Schmidt, 12 March 1895; and also to Hirsch, 19 March, to Paul Lafa rgue, 3 April, to Karl Kautsky, 21 May 1895, and a few others.
Of particular interest here are comments of a methodological nature, still pertinent toda y.
Engels once again warns against a dogmatic approach to Marxism.
‘But Marx’s whole way of thinking’, he wrote to Sombart, ‘is not so much a doctrine as a method.
It provides not so much ready-made dogmas as aids to fu rther investigation, and the method for such investigation’ (p.
461).
His thoughts on the objective nature of the historical process are very profound: ‘As Marx sees it, the whole of past history, so far as major events are concerned, is an unconscious process, i.
e.
, those events and the consequences th ereof are not deliberate; either the supernumeraries of history have wanted something that was the diametrical opposite of what was achieved, or else that achievement entailed consequences quite other than those th at had been foreseen’ (ibid).
Engels sets out his understanding of the di alectics of the necessary and the fortuitous, the concept and the phenomenon (p.
466), ideologies (p.
164), the role of the individual in history (p.
266), and also some ideas on the history of the Peasant War in Germany in the 16th century (p.
???), the communal form of ownership (pp.
214, 488) and other questions.
As in previous years, questions of foreign policy were often touched upon in Engels’ correspondence, primarily in terms of ascertaining the position of the socialist parties with respect to the threat of war.
Engels volume of Das Kapital.
Having returned to this work in the autumn of 1892, he continued it, with only brief interruptions, up to the publication of the book at the beginning of December 1894.
Almost every letter during these years contains at least one brief reference to his work on the manuscript, and then on the proofs.
‘I have been compelled to decline all outside work, though ever so tempting, unless absolute ly necessary’, he wrote in March 1893 (p.
123).
More than a year later, having sent the last part of the manuscript to the printers, he summed up the situation in a letter to Nikolai Danielson: ‘Everything not absolutely n ecessary had to be put back in order to finish Vol.
3rd’ (p.
309).
Following the publication of the book, Engels immediately began to carry through his own plans.
On 17 Decem ber 1894 he described to Laura Lafargue a detailed plan for re-editions and new works, a plan amazing in its scope.
‘That is my position’, he wrote, ‘74 years, which I am beginning to feel, and work enough for two men of 40 .
.
.
But as it is, all I can do is to work on with what is before me and ge t through it as far and as well as I can’ (p.
387).
He did not abandon the idea of new editions of the earlier works of Marx, which had become virtually unobtainable, and, as he wrote to R.
Fischer on 15 April 1895, ‘I have a sche me for again presenting Marx’s and my lesser writings to the public in a complete edition’ (p.
497).
However he succeeded in carrying through only a small part of this project.
The contents of this volume reveal the attention which Engels gave, Special mention must be made of those of Engels’s letters which speak about his trip to the continent in August-September 1893.
In them he de- scribes his impressions of what he sa w and the changes that had taken place in Europe over the previous two decades, the state of affairs in the workers’ movement in Germany and Austria, and his assessment of the International Socialist Congress in Zurich.
Everything in these letters is of interest: the details of daily life noted by his sharp eye, his stories, full of humour and good will, about people he met, and his optimistic impressions of meetings with workers—members of th e Social-Democratic Party.

To The Reader Volume 50 completes the first and, as yet, the only edition of the works and correspondence of Karl Marx and Fr ederick Engels in English known as the Collected Works.
This edition of the works of Marx and Engels was undertaken on the request of Marxist scholars in England and the USA by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism (now the Russian Independent Institute of Social and National Problems, and is published jointly by Lawrence and Wishart (Great Britain), International Publishers (USA) and ‘Progress’ Engels—3,957 letters—of which most (2,283) have hitherto never been published in English.
This edition also offers English-speaking readers their first opportunity to acquaint themselves with a newly comprehensive way of publishing Marx’s economic works, including the three volumes of Capital and two preparatory manuscripts (volumes 30-37).
Great changes have taken place since Ma rx and Engels wrote their works, changes which could not be anticipated in their day, and many postulates in their theory now inevitably require critical reassessment.
One thing, however, remains indisputable, and that is the enormous contribution they made to the development of socialist thought.
The unbiased reader can appreciate the scale of thei r intellectual influence.
There can be no doubt that the publication of the theoretical and epistolary work of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels has enriched man’s scientific and cultural legacy.
The editors wish to express their th anks to subscribers and readers for their co-operation over a period of some 29 years (the first volume was published in 1975), during which they have expressed both criticism and unwavering interest, and also commendable patience in awaiting publication of the final volumes.
Has He Done, I have unearthed one more copy of each and these are en- closed herewith.
On the other hand I have only one copy of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, but no loose issues, and only a few volumes of the Revuec; if I want a complete set I have to borrow it.
Y ou had better get Miquel to return you yours.
After all he is the only one who might now be endangered by its possession and he’ll be grateful to you for taking it off his hands.
However Volume I as well as other indivi dual volumes occasionally crop up in second-hand booksellers’ catalogues.
For the rest, I am keeping tolerably well.

W.
, London, 6 October 1892 Dear Sirs, In reply to your favour of 2.
X, I have in the past frequently complied with requests of a similar nature from gentlemen who were quite unknown to me, but my experience in these cases has been such that unfortunately I have had to make up my mind to discontinue the practice.
4 As a result of an indisposition, moreover, I expect to be tied to my sofa for a considerable time to come and hence am in no condition to go searching in my library for old, seldom used periodicals.
a of Capital - b Gertrud and Franziska Kugelmann IN BERLIN London, 7 October 1892 Dear August, First to business.
Lafargue sent me a France with the enclosed notice of an interpellation by Millevoye, 5 a Boulangist.
6 He intends to make use of this opportunity to remind the Chamber of everything done by the German Socialists in 1871 and thereafter to maintain or restore good relations between France and Germany, and of what they have had to endure as a result.
He would like to have: les dates des protestations des socia listes allemands, les paroles prononcées au Reichstag et ailleurs, et les condamnations subies a .
Now since the things I have here are incomplete or only to be extracted with untold labour from collections of periodicals buried in numerous packing-cases, during which process I might easily overlook what is most important, you would greatly oblige me and the French if you would take out the most cogent items and send them to me together with dates and references (from the official stenographic report).
That is, a The dates of the protests by the German Soci alists, the speeches made in the Reichstag and elsewhere, and the sentences served.
reports on Liebknecht’s speeches and also a piece by Guesde which will have pleased you.
a Lafargue will be drumming up support in Carmaux and other towns in the South until his return on the 16th or 17th of this month, That is when the Chamber reassembles, and he must have the material by then.
9 He writes to say that the patriotic press, all of which, and particularly La France, is in the pay of Russia, has launched furious attacks on Liebknecht.
The Russian embassy now pays the newspapers by the job—so much for each individual article accepted.
Which is also a sign that the Russians are short of funds.
There is no doubt that Liebknecht has raised a furore.
I don’t begrudge the old man his popularity and, in two respects, can only hope, 1.
that it won’t make him even more obstinate with regard to the editorship of the Vorwärts and, 2.
that in the Reichstag the malicious sniping of the German patriots and accusations of hi gh treason, etc.
, don’t suddenly provoke him into maintaining the opposite, thereby landing not just himself in the cart but us as well.
A reporter on the Gaulois quotes him as saying: ‘Were Germany to declare a war of aggression on France, the German Socialists would declare war on their own government, et moi-même je prendrais un fusil pour a J.

paper will now hold out for us.
Your account of the movement among the miners tallies with our experience in this country; here, too, the chaps keep themselves very much apart from the other branches of labour and are progressing more slowly than the rest.
But in our case, the fact that there is already a strong workers’ party behind them will eventually s ee us through; the chaps are bound to join us, once the movement has taken a hold on them.
On the other hand there are, both here and in Germany, bad and unr eliable leaders who cannot be induced to trust the workers in other branches.
In this country, moreover, the petty jealousies existing between the men of one coal-field and another have so far not even permitted the creation of a united guild comprising all mine workers.
I shall do my utmost to stop the French from dispensing with your con- tributions.
It is vitally important th at occasionally, at any rate, accurate reports on the German movement should appear in Paris and particularly that the public should be made aware of th e general political situation in which you people have to carry on the fight.
You alone can do that, nor is there any need at all for you to come into conflict with Liebknecht as a result, provided he doesn’t regard contributions to the French paperb as his monopoly.
That wouldn’t do at all.
a and I myself would take up a musket in order to defend the integrity of French territory.
b Le Socialiste circumstances revolutionary and never r eactionary.
The jackass fails to notice that where there is no reactionary power to be overthrown there can be no question whatever of revolutionary power.
After all, you cannot start a revolution against something that can be removed without the least effort.
If there is one thing that sends the self-opinionated students, the men of letters and the would-be literati of the working class into a state of impotent rage, it is the sight of our party calmly continuing along its victorious course without needing the help from these petty panjandrums.
If mistakes are made, the party is strong enough to deal with them itself.
Witness the undeniably tame philistinism of the majority of th e parliamentary group at the time of the Steamship Subvention, wit-ness the traditional tendency of the Party Executive, a tendency which continued to manifest itself for a short while after the Anti-Socialist Law had been repeal ed, to intervene in a dictatorial manner (and which, moreover, had its counterpart in an identical tendency among the executives of the previous Berlin organisation), etc.
, etc.
Our Party is now so strong that it could, without risk of degeneration, digest not only a goodly number of petty bourgeois but also the “heddicated” and even the worthy Independents, 16 had not the latter given themselves their marching orders.

I think this will be sufficient for Paul’s speech, though I don’t envy you the task of translating all these things, especially the rather lax style of our Reichstag orators.
Anyhow, now Paul is armed and need not depend upon Liebknecht’s promises which are sooner made than kept, as a rule.
I am glad Paul is going to take part again in the debates of the Chambre,d and if he is wise, he will attend the Palais Bourbon 6 assiduously during this last session of the present Parliament.
I have some notion that electors want to see and hear something of the parliamentary activity of their deputy, and if they do not, there may be a risk not only of losing his seat, but also of not so easily securing another.

So far, his a ttitude in his speeches in Mannheim 22 etc.
has been all that could be desired.
I understand your news about Roubaix to this effect that the people there will ask Paul to stand for the Chamber next autumn.
That would be very good, Roubaix would be a pretty safe seat , while Lille seems rather shaky, to be carried at a period of extra local exc itement, but very uncertain, so far, at ordinary periods.
Anyhow, ca marche en Francec (everything but the Journal quotidien!)d and Carmaux 10 shows not only the progress of our ideas among the working- class, but also the fact of the bourgeois and the government knowing, it.
The self-contained attitude of the people there— et encore des méridiouaux, des Gascons gasconnants!e—and the quiet but determined way in which the socialist town-councils proceed wit hout any possibil-ist weakness or concessions, show an immense progress.

You say: ‘whereas the French socialists are protesti ng against the Russian alliance and do not wish to hear about a war with Germany, Bebel in pa rticular and you yourse lf are quite willing to accept the idea of a defensive war against France and Russia in which the German socialists would take part’, and that ‘these accusations , which are well received in France, irritate Guesde’.

You say that the brochure is well done.
I find it very weak; the end, where this joker poses as an economist is more than grotesque.
If he has a strong point, it is the royal disdain which he pours out on his readers.
Indeed, one must assume that one’s readers are incura ble idiots in order to dare to offer them such a collection of palpable falsehoods (in which you see only snippets) and lies contradicting one another.
Is it then sufficient to put on a masque of Dérouléde in order to persuade those who create public opinion in Paris to swallow anything one wishes.
Has Boulangism 6 survived Boulanger to the point of being more powerful than during Boulanger’s lifetime? Such a collection of lies and falsehoods is, in fact, irrefutable.
It would require 3,200 pages to reassert the truth against these 32 pages.
There is not a single quotation of any significance which is not shamelessly distorted; it was only after comparing several texts that I had the measure of M.
Protot’s affrontery.
As for the literary style, I find it lamentable, in striking contrast to the assiduity with which he has collected his material.

It is Russia, in fact, which needs France.
She is so completely exhauste d by the social disorganisation caused by the economic transformation that she has been experiencing since 1861, by the ravages of deforestation, by the ruination of agriculture and the cottage industry, by famine and cholera, that she could not wage a war through to the end.
Her finances and her credit are in a state of collapse reminiscent of France in 1788; if the western public continues to keep its purse closed, there remain only three alternatives: 1) bankruptcy, 2) the convening of a national assembly to sanction a new loan, whic h then might succeed in the west; 3) war as a measure of desperation— and in that last case France is necessary: once war were declared, the French ar my engaged, ten against one, the Tsard would reach an agr eement with Williame and Francis Joseph,f who would hasten to meet him, and la belle France would pay the expenses of the banquet of reconciliation.

I shall ask Aveling for the address which I cannot find.
Yesterday I walked up Primrose Hill for the first time and, provided I’m careful, think I shall have made some slight progress by the end of the week.
I shall make a note of MacEwen.
He is at any rate a CONSULTING SURGEON which means that he can only advise other doctors and not the public direct.
But I shall find that out.
You have no idea of the extent to which everything here, including medicine, is governed by etiquette and how one breach of that etiquette is infinitely more frowned upon than ten of the sexual code.
I recall a dictum of the Mancunian Me dico-Ethical Society which sat in judgement over my friend Gumpert in Manchester.
While paying a visit of condolence (this was around 1866-67) to a family who were not his patients, he had expressed slight misgivings about their family doctor’s having permitted other children to approach th e bodies of two children who had died of scarlet fever.
The other doctor lodged a complaint and the verdict was: THAT DR GUMPERT HAD COMMITTED A BREACH OF MEDICAL ETIQUETTE, THOUGH HE WAS MORALLY RIGHT! Well, again my best thanks—I shall follow your advice.
Tomorrow I shall again write to Stepniak about his work 32.

You speak of an unfortunate phrase by Bebel—which one? You reproach him with so many! If it is the one in Figaro that he would fire at Guesde, it belongs to M.
Huret; Bebel writes that it existed only in this gentleman’s fantasy.
You talk of preventing war, and you boast of having voted for Domela 34— with his plan you would crush all the socialist parties in Europe.
It is all very fine to speak of preventing a war, from whichever side it might come.
But why allow yourself to believe in illusions.
Do the French socialists have some means of preventing the young Williama from declaring war in a moment of madness? Can the German socialists forbid Carnot or some patriotic ministry to commit a similar folly? Furthermore, if it were William or the street-corner revanchists who were the real danger; it is the Russian government which is pulling th e strings of these puppets, these by hopes, those by fears.
So now prevent it from inciting war! If war breaks out, those who are defeated will have the opportunity and the duty to bring about a revolution—and that’s that.

Hence all my correspondence is interrupted and I can write you only a few words.
It is most unfortunate that you believed in Millevoye’s promises, who flouted you like a good politician 36— in future you will know that in politics such people pass for GENTLEMEN .
I get letter after letter from Germany in which they complain about your absen ce at the critical moment and I warn you that it will be difficult to have our people undertake work for debates from which the principal speaker for whom the work is done absents himself.
Publication in pamphlet form 9 will not have a hundredth part of the effect of a parliamentary speech; that’s a matte r on which our Berlin people are well qualified by experience to pronounce.
The least you might do would be to send a delegate to Berlin on the 14th, 37 that would enable you to have it out with our people over there.
So do try to send someone; it’s an expedition that will pay.
You will have seen the reports in the papers of the ghastly effects, in Dahomey, of the new projectiles.
38 A young Viennese doctora who has just arrived here (ex-assistant to Not hnagel) saw the wounds made by the Austrian projectiles in the Nurmitz strike, and he tells us the same thing.
There’s no doubt that people in danger of being shot to bits in this manner will want to know why.
It’s a capital th ing for maintaining peace, but also for curbing the so-called revolutionary inclinations, on whose outbursts our governments count.
The era of barricades and street fighting has gone for good; if the military fight, resistance becomes madness.

Kind regards to Mrs.

Kautsky and Yours faithfully F.
Engels Dear August, All this time I have been slaving away dutifully at Volume II P and not, I’m glad to say, without success.
Today I may already be said to be fairly past the main obstacle, the credit system—upon which nothing remains to be done but the technical editing—which, however, is of a complex and time- consuming nature.
33 I have greatly enjoyed the work, firstly because I have discovered so many brilliant new sides to it—ask Louise,b to whom I have read quite a lot of it out loud—and s econdly because it has also shown me that, when all’s said and done, my ol d noddle is still up to the mark, even where relatively difficult things are c oncerned.
The worst havoc the years have wrought is in the sphere of memory whose doors are no longer so easy to find or to open, which means a general slowing down.
This is something I can very well put up with, however.
But though I may have broken the back of the work, it’s very far from finished.
Besides this section there still remain the two last ones (rather less than 1/3 of the whole) which I haven’t so much as looked at yet, and then comes the final, technical editing of the whole which, while not difficult, is all the more tedious and wearisome for that.
It will probably take me the whole of the winter—and then there’ll be the proofs—coinciding with those of the 2nd ed.

True, the blunders committed at the time of the Steamship Subvention, 13 etc.
, are over and done with, but the same people are still around and some, at least, are capable of acting as before.
It all the blunders perpetrated by the parliamentary group and by some of its members are to be concealed under a mantle of love, this would, in my opinion, be tantamount to breeding Independents.
16 Messrs Frohme, Blos, etc.
, should acquire a thicker skin.
Am I wrong in attributing certain motions redolent of ‘Independence’, tabled at the Party Congress by the Solingen people, to the latter’s opposition to Schumacher’s bourgeoisifica tion and philistinisation? 42 A touch of retrospective veracity in the Neue Zeit would do no harm and you, with your tact and expertise, would be the right man for the job—but whether, of course, your position on the Executive doesn’t make this inadvisable is another matter.
One way or the other, however, such criticism must eventually be expressed.
It was with pleasure that I read th e report of your Executive last night.

conspiracy of silence is easily imposed.
The Chroniclea is in the hands of the Fabians where labour matters are concerned, Justice has been led by Hyndman to espouse the cause of that rotter Gilles, the Workman’s Times likewise believes that nothing’s any good unless based on a big English-style TRADES UNION organisation—so where are we to get the thing published? Only in the bourgeois press, as a news item of general interest.
If, for the space of no more than a year, we coul d find a paper willing to open its pages to straightforward accounts of the German movement, the whole business would come to an end.
For there is enough latent internationalism, if nurtured, to put paid to the stupid arrogance of the British, at least in the majority of cases.

The pitfall in this case was the phrase state socialism.

38, Moscow, 1965 Published in English for the first time 19 ENGELS TO AUGUST BEBEL IN BERLIN London, 19 November 1892 Dear August, This time your Party Congress 51 didn’t go off as brilliantly as it did on the last occasion.
The debate on the que stion of salary leaves a very a 17 November material drawbacks.
It’s absolutely essential for you to have a press in the party which is not directly dependent on the Executive or even the Party Congress, i.
e.
which is in a position unreservedly to oppose individual party measures within the programme and accepted tactics, and freely to criticise that programme and those tactics, within the limits of party decorum.
As the Party Executive, you people ought to encourage a press of this nature— indeed initiate it, for you would then exert far more moral sway over it than if it were to come into being partly against your will.
The party is outstripping the strict discipline of earlier days; with 2 or 3 millions and an influx of ‘heddicated’ elements, more latitude is needed than what has hitherto not only sufficed but actually proved a useful restraint.
The sooner you people adapt yourselves and the party to this changed situation the better.
And the first step is a formally independent party press.
It is bound to come about but it would be better if you were to allow it to come about in such a way that it remains under your moral sway from the outset and does not arise in opposition to yourselves.
You people blundered badly—not in Berlin but at Brussels 54— over the question of the May Day celebrations.
You must have known at the time what you could promise and perform, and yet you went and promised more than you are now able to perform.
I c onsider your own speech on the subject no whit inferior to Victor’s and readily believe that a stoppage of work in Germany would demand sacrifices out of all proportion to victories and gains.
55 But when the strongest party in the world suddenly country.
The Austrians, to whom a stoppage of work on May Day is necessary, and who are accordingly prepar ed to make those very sacrifices which you rightly repudiated in your particular circumstances, are as justified in acting as they do as you were; now, however, they can make reproaches to which you can offer no answer.
For by their very conduct they have proved that the impossibility clause laid down at Brussels does not apply.
We over here have not yet had the state socialism debate.
I must congratulate you on your resolutions.
They are really first-rate and I know of only one person who could ha ve improved on them, namely Marx.
The resolution on state socialism, like that on anti-Semitism, hits the nail on the head.
And it is precisely resolutions of this kind that have in the past been the Achilles’ heel of the German movement; they have been sloppy, indeterminate, nebulous and cliché-ridden—in short, for the most part a disgrace.
Fortunately they are so untrans latable that anyone translating them into a foreign language is compelled to read into them a meaning which they themselves do not possess.
Below is a theatre drawn by Louise or Aveling.
For the past week the page thus embellished has been repeat edly placed amongst my writing paper, which is why it now has the honour of finding its way to you.

The Panama business, 60 circumstances aiding and abetting, could well become for the bourgeois republic the Pandora’s a Daily Chronicle — b Eduard Bernstein For the last few days I have been well enough again to go out for a quarter of an hour; I hope this will help to restore me altogether.
The Germans have committed a fine bl under over May Day; not in Berlin, but in Brussels.
34 They ought to have reserved the right, at the International Congress, to celebrate the day in their own way and according to circumstances.
Their withdrawal creates a deplorable impression and should you give them a good wigging, you’ll be doing no more than your duty.
Any other party could have allowed itself th is retrogressive move; they, in their position as the main body of the European army, could not make it without great prejudice to the movement as a whole.
I entirely approve the reasons which decided them in Berlin: the harm, to them, of a stoppage of work would have been out of all proportion to the advantages to them; but that should have been foreseen, and they s hould have had the courage at Brussels not to vote for a stoppage.
And what of Laura? When do we see her here? Kiss her for me.

Please keep me posted about the Panama affair with newspapers, it’s a of Marx’s Capital -b 27 November London, 29 November 1892 Dear Mrs Bebel, Of all the letters I got on my birthday, yours is the first I feel impelled to answer.
My most sincere thanks.
I spent the day ‘in the best of health’, for, even though I am not in full control of my movements and cannot walk as much as I should like to, I nevertheless feel quite robust and everyone says I look very well.
This time we turned my birthday into an English May Day celebration, i.
e.
we brought it forward from the Monday to the previous Sunday.
a Louise felt that, as I couldn’t fa il to tipple somewhat on an occasion like this, one day would be enough and two days too many.
We had a real houseful, our African, Sam Moore, also Bax, the Avelings, Bernsteins, Mottelers, the Russian Volkhovsky, and two working men from the Society 62 ; that, I think, was all.
No.
I nearly forgot little Inkab who has really filled out on the food she gets in Berlin and whose plumpness suits her very well— now I have tangible proof that people have learned how to eat their fill in Berlin and let no one speak to me in future about starving Berlin! We still had a small supply of dried woodruff and so Louise and I con- cocted a May cup with the aid of Moselle, red wine and champagne—at this foggy time of year it would hardly be possible to imagine, let alone a 27 November - b Inka Fischer I should like to have attended that beanfeast in Berlin.
Inka tells me that she could not get through to you and Be bel because of the crush so there must have been an enormous number present.
63 Still, I don’t doubt that I’ll witness something of that kind again, if not this year then the next, provided that is, you come over and fetch us.
The little Fischer girl sees in you so great a mental affinity with my dear good Lenchen that I can be doubly confident in placing myself in your charge.
As August left only one measly page for your use, I shall reverse the position and he will get only one from me.

I thought it probable that your Theodorc to whom, as also to Karl,d please convey my sincere thanks for the good wishes, would be able to take a break from his tedious week in Mittenwald by spending a Sunday with you, and I’m glad to see that this was in fact so.

73 I, who never passed an exam in my life, can nevertheless well imagine how a young man must feel three months before such an event.
The Stadthagen affair has shown that they are still perfectly capable of persecuting us even without the Anti-Socialist Law.
15 That the debate on salary at the Party Congress 52 has caused your family great annoyance I can well believe, but that kind of thing is inevitable in public life.
Not everyone is as eager as the German Reichstag to vote grants; in other countries even ministers and, on occasion, crowned h eads no less, must expose themselves to unpleasantnesses of this kind.
It is a case of everyone trying to prove that ‘where money begins, benevolence ends’.

Ol d Pflüger—a nephew of mine used to work in his laboratory—is, so far as I can judge, a real philistine and if, on top of that, Anschütz’s father was a Pru ssian officer, that makes matters even worse, The fact is that it will be difficult to find the right man for Carl’sb biography, one who is not only a chemist but also a Social Democrat, and not only a Social Democrat but also a chem ist and, what’s more, a chemist who has made a close study of the history of his discipline since Liebig’s day.
Presumably we shall have to wait and see whether we can find that man or whether we must content ourselves with the two aspects of Carl being treated separately.
I myself must above all else finally complete Volume II I of Capital and cannot see how I could break off just now—and on top of that there are also the proofs of the 2nd edition of Volume II ! And then, too, we live in very turbulent times, what with the military affair, 76 the impending crisis in Germany, the Panama scandals 60 and the crisis that has already set in in France as well as the crisis over Ireland that will almost certainly occur over here next spring.
77 In times like these my correspondence increases twofold and threefold and if, on top of everything else, one is forbidden on account of one’s eyes to wield a pen by lamplight, how can one possibly manage?

14 28 ENGELS TO CHARLES BONNIER 78 IN OXFORD [Draft] [London, 3 December 1892] My dear Bonnier, Es wird nichts so heiss ge gessen, wie es gekocht wird.
a You have the ad- mirable habit of serving warm, very warm, but would I not sometimes risk burning my lips? The newspaper, as you know, is not yet being published.
48 You ask me to convey to the Germans a kind of ultimatum from the French.
If I undertake to do so, will you guarantee that, in reply to a direct query by Berlin to Paris, Paris without disavowing me entirely would not say that I had exaggerated.
a If you don’t cool it, you’ll not be able to drink it.
English to disregard the resolutions of Brussels 54 but them alone.
79 What will French logic say to that?a As for the rest I know only one party which has the right to reproach the Berlin Congress.
51 That is the Austrian party.
81 Until now 1st May in Berlin has been worth far more than those in Paris.
I am writing today to Bebel.
b I will tell him of your ultimatum, but for the moment only as your personal opinion.

’ - b See next letter.
the general impression you produced in Brussels was that in future you too would celebrate on 1 May and not invoke the permission not to do so that was granted purely by way of an exception.
^ So you shouldn’t be surprised by the hullabaloo to which the Berlin resolution has given rise.
But your intention of getting Congress to settle on Sunday as the day on which celebrations should be held in future is likely to hit on some snags.
Except for the English everyone will be against it, many of the smaller parties out of sheer bravado.
It would be a sorry retreat and the last people to join in its official proclamation would be those who secretly reserve the right to do likewise, whether it was proclaimed or not.
Well, yesterday evening I got a rabid letter from Bonnier (he never writes any other kind) in which, having read your article in the Neue Zeit, 83 he declares in the name of the French that, if the first Sunday in May were to be adopted, they would drop the whole business of May Day.
‘ Jamais,’ he writes, ‘notre parti n’acceptera (le dimanc he) et nous sommes bien décidés à tenir ferme.
’’a And he believes you people are playing with fire.
I wrote and told himb 1.
that things are never as black as he paints them, 2.
asking who had authorised him to speak in the name of the French party, 3.
that before May 1893, and between then and August ‘93 in Zurich 56 and between then and May ‘94 much might happen a Our party would never agree (to the Sunday) a nd we are fully determined to stand firm.
- b See this volume, Letter 28 makes an infuriating amount of unnecessa ry work and I shall protest in no mean terms to Paris about this go-between.
The really unfortunate thing is that he’s the only person who understands German save for Laura, and she lives out of town.
For the rest, the Party Congress went off quite well, but subscribing to the resolution 84 despite the sundry rubbish it contains, must have been a bitter pill for Vollmar to swallow.
Ede came to see me, bringing with him a whole bunch of letters from K.
Kautsky—who had also written to me—all of them concerned with the Neue Zeit, and wanting me to add my mite.
My opinion is that, if you accept the change proposed by Dietz, you should think it out and prepare for it properly, and not go ahead till January, otherwise it will be altogether premature.
85 But speaking generally, I should say that, since becoming a weekly, the Neue Zeit has to some extent relinquished its old character in favour of a new one which it has not been completely successful in assuming.
The paper is now being written for two sets of readers and cannot do full justice to either.
If it is to become a popular, part-po litical, part-literary and artistic and part-learned journal, à la Nation, then it will have to move to Berlin.
The political section of a weekly must be written at the hub of things, on the eve of publication, otherwise it will always be lagging behind.
And, a Ferdinand Wolff this would have to be offset by raising the price if the paper was to be kept going.
Indeed, it seems to me altogether necessary, if the party publishers wish increasingly to secure a monopoly of party publications, including learned ones, that they should not aim at bulk sales for everything, whether suitable for that purpose or not.
An original paper on political economy is bound to be primarily a detailed treatise, nor can it be expected to sell in bulk.
Similarly, a genuine historical work, the outcome of independent research, does not lend itself to publication by installments.
In short, I think there should be two separate departments, one for bulk sales, the other for ordinary, slower-moving sa les through booksellers, in smaller quantities and at a correspondingly higher price.
What happens when an attempt is made to boost sales beyond the limits called for by the nature of the case is something I have learned from my own experience.
Though written as popularly as possible, my Anti-Dühring is by no means a book to suit every working man.
But along comes Dietz, takes over part of the Zurich edition and then tries to boost sales by remaindering the thing at a reduced price with 11 assorted booksellers.
This is not at all to my liking and next time I shall be on my guard.
It is the only longer work I have written since 1845 and, whichever a Stuttgart revelations were under way and a fe w people had become irretrievably implicated in the scandal, these ha d perforce to cover themselves by betraying their accomplices and showi ng that they had only been swimming with the stream.
Already the committee is in possession of such enormously compromising statements th at there’s no holding back; a few may slip through the net, but large numbers have already been named and, of course, the fewer the names that are compromised the great er the odium that attaches to the bourgeois republic.
Though much may still happen in the meantime, this is nevertheless the beginning of the end.
Fortunately all the monarchist parties are completely done for, nor will it be at all easy to find another Boulanger.
6 Herewith an extract from Lafargue’s letter for the Vorwärts —but do ensure that the paper gives no indication whatsoever that the letter emanated from a deputy.
88 What Liebknecht entirely overlooked in the matter of Bismarck’s Ems forgery was that that’s the sort of thing diplomats do in secret but never boast about.
75 But if one of them does happen to boast about it, the breach of etiquette is such as to render him persona non grata.
After this it will never again be possible to appoint Mr Bismarck Imperial Chancellor, otherwise any foreign government could refuse to enter into negotiations with a man who not only is not above using such methods, but actually boasts of having used them.
The Imperial Government would risk incur- unemployed and, last but not least, the Jews.
They are not getting the Vorwärts, August, so could you please make inquiries? Then, some tim e ago, I asked if you could let me have another copy of the Vorwärts’ report on the Congress, but you probably forgot—I’d like two if at all possible, otherwise one; it’s the re port on the Party Conference I want, not the one made by you people at the Conference.
Victor enjoyed the time he spent with you and wrote saying that to him it seemed as though the poor Austrians were standing guard in the wet and the cold, whereas you people were sitting snug in your encampment, despite the struggle and the fighting.
Then there’s another thing—I still have two English reports on the International Glassworkers’ Congress 89 to spare.
Would you like one? It’s very interesting, but you would have to write a few lines about it by way of justification and send a sample copy, and would you please ask Fischer if he might perhaps write something for a Bavarian paper, in which case I would send him the other copy.
I would, of course, send them without any strings attached but I feel responsible because it’s the English who have to pay for the whole thing, so I’d be grateful if you’d let me know.
I must close, so more anon; it’s time for the post and I must close.
With loving kisses to you and Julie, the Witch [Postscript from Engels] Please convey my most sincere thanks to the parliamentary group for their kind telegram last Sunday.
90 a Julie Bebel - b Adler Dear Baron, My best thanks for your good wishes in respect of a day that was spent very happily.
Alas, tippling still does not agree with me and I shall have to atone for it by abstaining for the next few weeks.
Thank you, too, for sending the prospectus for the new journal—do you know the chaps 91 ? I have never heard of any of them.
I haven’t yet been able so much as to look at Schmidt’s latest on the rate of profita since, until Volume II Ib is finished, I shall have to fend off everything that might entail extra work—there being far too many inter- ruptions as it is.
As for the Neue Zeit, 85 Edec and I have discussed it at length, and yesterday I wrote a long letterd to August on the subject.
It is my opinion that if, as proposed by Dietz and August, the Neue Zeit is to be given a lighter, more popular tone and made ‘more interesting’ from a literary point of view, it will have to move to Berlin.
For only there can a political review covering all events up to the eve of publication be catered for on the spot and only there can a wealth of artistic and literary work, which would otherwise come a week too late, be produced a C.

But in this way you could train your contributors to divide up their things themselves into 2 installments.
And then there could be ‘something for everyone’ in every number.
But here again, you would have to reckon on a reduced circulation, and hence be obliged to raise the pr ice—or so at least it seems to me.
At all events, before making any experiments you should consider the matter carefully.
Once made, a false step is difficult to reverse.
If the weekly Neue Zeit were to move to Berlin it would, in many respects, replace the weekly central organ which might otherwise hol d out for another year.
Between now and then a great deal may happen.
Things are livening up.
It looks as though the Panama scandal 60 might mark a turning-point so far as the development of France is concerne d.
You should pester Lafargue about collecting material for a longish essay on the subject, or supplying you with articles as each particular phase of the scandal reaches its climax.
With that sort of material the Neue Zeit would be able to outstrip the dailies even in the matter of factual news.
As for the Vorwärts —the less said the better! Your F.
Engels London, 5 December 1892 My dear Lafargue, Your remarks concerning Bebel compel me to refer back to your letter from Lille.
93 What you say about him is unfair in the extreme.
Far from Liebknecht correcting Bebel on any matte r whatsoever (an amusing idea to anyone who understands the situation), it’s precisely the contrary that is taking place.
It is Liebknecht who is promising wonders, and if the whole thing doesn’t collapse and dissolve, it’s thanks to the work Bebel is doing.
If Liebknecht said only agreeable things to you at Marseilles, don’t forget that this is how he behaves with everyone; 5 that he always acts on the impulse of the moment and that consequently he says white here today, but tomorrow somewhere else he will say black, and he will maintain in all good faith that he has not contradicted himself.
You complain about the Berlin resolution concerning May 1st, 54 well and good, according to our German press, Liebknecht is reported to have said that at Marseilles he explained the position to you, including the impossibility for the Germans to stop work on May 1st; and that ‘the French’ had fully acknowledged the force of his arguments.
If that is true, by what right do you complain of the Berlin resolution? If Liebknecht has erred (for he believes what he says), what have Zurich propose the postponing of the May celebrations to the first Sunday, the French will withdraw from the dem onstration altogether, and there will be, if not war, at least something like the breaking off of diplomatic relations—and goodness knows what else.
Anyhow he warns the Germans ‘that they are playing with fire’.
However, his French logic allows him to add that if the English insist on demonstrating on the Sunday, the French would see no harm in it! I answered him fairly ironically that I would communicate his ultimatum to Bebel, but only as his personal opinion.
b Naturally I don’t take Bonni er’s explosions for the attitude of the French Party; on the contrary, even if you authorised him I should not do so; I know him to be quite incapable—with the best will in the world—of expressing other people’s ideas and words without putting in his own.
He can’t help it; like Liebknecht, he only knows two shades, black and white; he either loves or hates; and as he cannot love Bebel, he needs must hate him.
But you would be monstrously wrong to form your view of the German movement according to his.
Laura being in the country cannot gainsay all the gossip about the Germans, and it’s a great pity that he is the only one of you all who understands German.

Had it not been to destroy the false judgements about the most perspicacious, the most sensible and the most energetic man in the German party, I would not have written to you at such length.

Then La Presse (Girardin’s) brought every day a fresh revelation about some scandal.
61 or some other paper brought a reply to some charge of his; and this went on till it killed Louis Philippe.
But those scandals, and even those of the Second Empire dwindle into nothingness compared with this Grand Nationa l Steeplechase of Scandals.
Louis Bonaparte took jolly good care, when he coaxed the peasants’ money out of their buried hoards, to do so for the benefit of his State loans, which were safe; but here the savings of the sma ll tradesman, the peasant, the domestic servant and above all of the petit rentier,a the loudest howler of all, have gone into irretrievable ruin, and the miracle has been performed of transforming a canal which has not been dug out, into an unfathomable abyss.
1,500 million francs, 60 milli on pounds sterling, all gone, gone for ever, except what has found its way into the pockets of swindlers, politicians and journalists; and the money got together by swindles and corrupt dodges unequalled even in America.
What a base of operations for a Socialistic campaign! The thing has evidently been based upon its own immensity.
a small rentier had a right to expect it, to enter upon a career of immense responsibility.
I should be glad of it, if it does not co me too soon and too suddenly.
It will do our Germans good to see that the French have not lost their historical initiative.
A country cannot pass through 200 years like what 1648-1848 were for Germany without leaving a sm all impression of the philistine even on the working class.
Our revolution of 48/49 was too short and too incomplete to wipe that out altogether.
Of course, the next revolution which is preparing in Germany with a consistency and steadiness unequalled anywhere else, would come of itself in time, say 1898-1904; but revolutionary times, preparing a thoroughgoing crisis, in France, would hasten that process, and moreover, if the thing breaks out in France first, say 1894, then Germany follows suit at once and then the Franco-German Proletarian Alliance forces the hands of England and smashes up in one blow both the triple and the Franco-Russian conspiracies; then we have a revo- lutionary war against Russia—if not even a revolutionary echo from Russia— vogue la Galère!c Love from Louise who is at a meeting of actors and dramatists for the foundation of a freie Bühne or théâtre libred or what not.

Dear Mrs Stepniak, Mrs Kautsky showed me your note in which you are kind enough to ask me to spend next Saturday evening with you.
I should do so with the greatest pleasure, but unfortunately my locomotive capabilities are still too limited to enable me to undertake such distant expeditions.
I am at present practically confined to the neighbourhood of Primrose Hill, and Mrs Kautsky will be able to tell you that I have been obliged to decline invitations besides yours.
Kind regards to Stepniak from Yours sincerely, F.
Engels Esteemed Comrade, Many thanks for kindly sending your Geschichte des Arbeiter- Bildungsvereins.
a I regard the publication of studies on the history of the Austrian labour movement as a highly rewarding task, the more so since in our fast-moving time some moments, important in themselves, are lost to posterity as they only live on in the memory of the participants and have never been recorded in writing.
I, for my part, am again working diligently on Volume 3,b a bit of news which will probably compensate you for my not answering your kind letter in person.

I was pleased to learn from Mendelson that you are well.
As for me, I have no reason to complain—quite the contrary.
For three months now I have been working on the 3rd volume of Capital, and although there is still a great deal to do, this time I have grounds to hope that I will finish it.
As for the Berlin resolution, I am of the opinion that the Germans committed at Brussels the mistake of promising—although indirectly— more than they can fulfil.
54 The 1st May 1890 and ‘91 has shown that in Germany a strike is impractical; the sacrifices were not worth the possible gains.
At Hamburg alone the attempt cost more than 100,000 marks.
98 The coincidence that 1st May 1892 was a Sunday led them to forget in Brussels that real world to which the crisis—more acute this time in Germany than elsewhere—has sharply returned them.
The strike on 1st May ‘93 could cost us too dear—in Germany, and, by reaction, elsewhere.

In France no man would stand a chance in a popular constituen cy, a town especially, who openly wanted to get into Parliament for the purpose of furthering his own interests; here, anybody who wanted to get in for any other purpose would be considered a fool and a Don Quixote.

It’s unfortunate for both French and Germans that this chap should be an indispensable middleman between the two, since Guesde seems reluctant to make use of any one else.
But thwarted as it is by the isolation and inactivity of Oxford, his enthusiasm plus his intense urge to be up and doing serves to evoke discord rather than collaboration.
And in the present state of Europe what is called for above all else is precisely the harmonious collaboration of Germans and French.
Many thanks for the Reichstag stenographic reports.
I shall not be able to read your big speech about the Army until tonight, but I was delighted by what you said about Heinze’s law.
99 So long as prostitution cannot be wholly eradicated, our first bid ought, I think, to be the girls’ total exemption from any kind of extraordinary legislation.
Here in England this is more or less the case; there are no ‘morality police’, and no controls or medical examinations, but the police still have tremendous power because it is a punishable offence to keep a disorderly house, and every house in which a girl lives and receives visitors can be treated as su ch.
But although this law is enforced only on rare occasions, the girls ar e none the less exposed to frightful extortion on the part of policemen.
This relative freedom from degrading police restrictions enables the girls to preserve an independent and self- respecting character in a way that a See this volume, pp.
46-47 It is my belief that, in dealing with this matter, we should above all consider the interests of the girls themse lves as victims of the present social order, and protect them as far as possible against ending up in the gutter—or at least not actually force them into the gutter by means of legislation and police skulduggery as happens throughout the Continent.
In this country the same thing was attempted in a number of garrison towns where controls and medical examinations were introduced, but it didn’t last long; the only good thing the social purity people have done has been to agitate against this.
Medical examinations are absolutely worthless.
Wherever they were introduced here, syphilis and gonorrhoea increased.
I am convinced that a police surgeon’s instruments are exceed ingly effective in transmitting vene- real disease, since he would be unlikely to spend time or trouble on disin- fecting them.
Free courses on venereal disease should be made available to the girls, then most of them woul d probably take precautions themselves.
Blaschko has sent us an article on medical controlsa in which he is forced to admit that these are absolu tely useless; if he were to draw the logical conclusion from his own assumptions, he would be bound to conclude that prostitution must be freed from all restrictions and the girls be protected a A.

It is an excellent way of turning to account and putting on display the very things one has not learnt.
One has only to look at what the late-lamented Volksstaat achieved in that sphere! The Panama business 60 gets nicer every day.
As so often in France the affair is taking a quite dramatically exaggerated course.
At any moment, or so it seems, the efforts to thrust it out of sight are going to succeed, and then up it springs again where least expect ed and more vigorously than ever before.
Now the situation is such that no hushing up will avail.
First the affair was to be hushed up in the courts, whereupon fresh revelations necessitated the setting up of a committee of inquiry; then it was the latter that was to be hamstrung, an attempt that was only partially successful and only to the extent that further legal proceedings of a more serious nature were instituted.
And now there’s a spate of fresh revelations and prosecutions of deputies and senators.
The ball has been set rolling and is very far from coming to a stop.
Standing in the wings are 1.
Constans, who knows that he is played out and is anxious to avenge himself, 2.
Rochefort and the Boulangists, 6 who also know a great deal, 3.
the Orléans family, who would like to make use of all this farcical business to attempt a restoration.
All these people know a great deal and can to a large extent prove it.
And if the worst comes to the worst, Ch.
a Leonhard Tauscher How it will all end is obvious—ultimately in our favour.
But in a country as incalculable as France it is difficult to predict what intermediate stages there will be.
Several, at any rate, before our people really take possession of the stage.
Only if there were to be revolution in Paris would the Socialists come to power; for in Paris—cf.
the Commune— every revolution is automatically socialist.
But Paris is less turbulent than the provinces and that is a good thing, Paris is blasé, not l east because the workers, disunited, confused and patriotic (in so far as they sense that Paris is—wrongly, or so they feel— no longer the political hub of the world), can see no way out.
Should the scandals continue, there might be a presidential crisis—Carnot has at least connived at a lot of dirty work—and whatever happens there will be parliamentary elections next year.
Also a good many municipal elections in Paris.
All this will provide more than enough legal loopholes.
On the other hand, uncertainty as to the reliability of the army (which is new to general military service and not so hardened to it as Prussia) is a safeguard against coups d’ état, as is the unarmed state of the masses (who this time could not, as always before, turn to the Na tional Guard for guns and ammunition) against attempted uprisings.
It therefor e seems very probable that the crisis will take a peaceful course.
It’s just what we need, however, if we are to have time to reap the benefits of Panama—no violent upheavals and time for the ferment to take effect throughout the country.
In the provinces the Marxists have virtually no rivals; in Paris it is, for the time being, quite the worse and most time-consuming part is behind me; this time I shall finish.
When you come over here I shall show it to you.
You would in any case do better to come via Calais; it’s hardly any further from Stuttgart and maybe even somewhat nearer than via Ostend.

Secondly, there are, in the Chamber, not only Marxists but also Blanquists, 20 Allemanists 21 and free lances à la Cluseret— not to mention complete reprobates such as Lachize and Thivrier who have latched on to our coat-tails—and, with the socialist groups in Parliament differing as they do, it would be easy for the others to give them as good as they got, so to speak.

Engels’ nickname may twist and turn, they cannot simply di scount, as if it were a bill, what is beyond doubt a tremendous future, but will have to wait until it falls due; and precisely because that future is so great, their present must be largely taken up with preparations for it, a task which, as in any young country, is chiefly of a material nature and calls for a de gree of conservative thinking, a clinging to traditions connected with the f ounding of the new nationality.
The Anglo- Saxon race—those damned Schleswig-Ho lsteiners as Marx always called them—is in any case slow in the uptake, a trait its history both in Europe and in America (economic success and, on the whole, peaceful political evolution) has tended to foster.
Here momentous events alone can be of any avail and if, in addition to the transfer—now almost complete—of state- owned lands into private hands, industry were to expand under a somewhat less hare-brained tariff policy and forei gn markets be conquered, things might also go well for you people.
In this country, too, the class struggles were more violent during the period of growth of large-scale industry and petered out precisely at the time of Britain’s undisputed industrial domination in the world; similarly in Germany the growth of large-scale industry since 1850 has coincided with the rise of the socialist movement, and in America things are not likely to turn out any differently.

so I am told, documents are shortly to be published in Switzerland; Schlüter should keep an eye out for anything about the Banca Romana that appears in the press.
And in Holy Russia the Russian Prince Mesh chersky waxes in- dignant over the indifference with whic h the Panama revelations are received in Russia, the only explanation for this being, he says, that Russian virtue has been corrupted by the example of the Fr ench, and that ‘we ourselves have more than one Panama here at home’.
However, the Panama affair is the beginning of the end of the bourgeois republic and may soon place us in so me very responsible positions.
The whole of the opportunist 87 and the better part of the Radical gang 86 are compromised up to the hilt; the government is seeking to hush things up but that is no longer possible, for documentary evidence is in the hands of people who wish to overturn those now in power: 1.
The Orleans, 2.
the former minister Constans, now out of the r unning because of reve lations about his scandalous past, 3.
Rochefort and the Boulangists, 6 4.
Cornelius Herz who, being himself deeply involved in all manner of frauds, has plainly taken refuge in London merely in order to buy his way out by compromising his fellows.
All these people have more than enough evidence against this thieving crew, but are holding back, firstly and more generally, so as not to expend all their powder at one go and, secondly, in order to give the government and the courts of law time to become hopelessly compromised.
This is all grist to our mill; enough in formation gradually leaks out not only to keep the pot on the boil and cleared, some general or other doesn’t seize power and foment a war; that is the only danger.
In Germany the party’s undeviating, irresistible advance proceeds at a steady pace.
Everywhere small successe s provide proof of progress.
If the Army Bill 76 is adopted more or less as it stands, there’ll be a new floodtide of malcontents coming to join our ranks.
If the bill is thrown out, there’ll be a dissolution, a general election, and we shall get at least fifty seats in the Reichstag which, in a conflict, might often give us the deciding vote.
At all events the struggle, while it may, perhaps, also break out in France, can only be fought to a finish in Germany.
But it’s a good thing that Volume II Ib is now at last to be completed—not that I can say when that will be.

accretions in the provinces, so that th e setting up of a third party was no bad thing.
But now, such is the extent of those accretions—especially in the industrial districts of the North—that even at this, the first congress, the new party was more strongly represented than either the Social Democratic Federation or the Fabians, if not more strongly than both put together.
And since the bulk of its members are undoubtedly first class, since its centre of gravity lies in the provinces rather than in that hive of intrigue, London, and its programme is substantially the same as our own, Aveling did right in joining it and in accepting a position on the Executive.
If th e petty private ambitions and intrigues of the London panjandrums can be kept under some control, and its tactics are not too misguided, the Independent Labour Party may succeed in enticing away the masses, not only from the Social Democratic Federation but, in the provinces, also from the Fabians, and thus enforcing unity.
The Social Democratic Federation has pushed Hyndman completely into the background.
It did so badly as a result of his policy of intrigue that— thanks to the provincial delegates—Hyndman has been utterly discredited in the eyes of his own people.

85- 86 consequence of bourgeois liberalism—hence their tactics of not directly confronting the Liberals as opponents but of inducing them to draw socialist conclusions, ergo they cheat them in order to PERMEATE LIBERALISM WITH SOCIALISM and do not put up socialist candidates against the Liberals, but rather foist the former on them by force if not by false pretences.
That in so doing they are either betraying and hoodwinking themselves, or else are hoodwinking socialism, they do not, of course, realise.
With great assiduity they have produced, along with all manner of trash, a number of good propaganda pieces —the best of this kind, in fact, the English have produced.
But the moment they come to their own brand of tactics and gloss over the class struggle, the rot sets in.
Hence, too, their fanatical hatred of Marx and all the rest of us —because of the class struggle.
Needless to say, the chaps have a bi g middle-class following and therefore funds and, in the provinces, they have many dependable working men who refuse to have anything to do with the Social Democratic Federation.
But 5/6 of their provincial members see more or less eye to eye with us and, when it comes to the point, they will definitely desert.
In Bradford—where they are represented—they have several tim es voiced unqualified opposition to the Fabians’ London Executive.
As you see, it is a critical juncture so far as the movement over here is concerned, and something may come of the new organisation.
For a short while it looked as though it might come under the wing of causing men like Keir Hardie, Shaw Maxwell and others to pursue sundry ulterior aims.
But the danger inherent in this diminishes in proportion as the party itself grows in strength and numbe rs, and has, indeed, already receded because of the necessity of not leavi ng any loopholes for competing sects.
In recent years socialism has made enor mous headway among the masses in the industrial districts, and I look to those masses to keep the leaders properly in order.
Of course there will be blunders and to spare, and also jiggery-pokery of every description; let us only hope we are able to keep them within proper bounds! At worst the setting up of a new organisation may be regarded as an advantage in that it is easier to achieve unity when there are three competing sects than when there are two which are diametrically opposed to one another.
As regards what you wr ote about Poland on 23 December, since the time of Kronstadt the Prussians have been prepared to go to war with Russia and are therefore pro -Polish (indeed have provided proof of this).
117 The said Poles will have sought to exploit this to provoke a war whereby they hope to be liberated with Germany’s help.
But that is not at all what Berlin wants and, should they pull off their coup, Caprivi will undoubtedly leave them in the lurch.
At the moment a war would be utterly useless to us; we have a sure means of making progress which a war could only disrupt.
Warm regards to your wife and yourself.
Mrs Kautsky, who wrote to ENGELS TO LOUIS HÉRITIER IN GENEVA [Draft] [London,] 20 January 1893 Dear citizen, It is with sincere satisfaction that I see from your letter of 25 December that the passage taken from your article on Beckera was distorted in trans- lation.
49 Indeed, I was amazed when I saw your name at the end of the article.
I had heard you spoken of with truly paternal affection, and the expressions used in your article on Becker constituted a far too painful contrast.
Unfortunately, you still let the public believe them to be yours, as the rest of the article also.
As for what you have to say in the Volks-Tribüne concerning my obser- vations, this in no way changes my opinion.
You must know that MM.
the anarchists invented the slander about the conference held in Marx’s house 118 with the sole purpose of proving that Marx wished to secure his own preponderance by any means, fair or foul.
You say that this is his domination over the delegates.
For you this alleged fact is worth being a Johann Philipp Becker the French and Belgian internationals—Proudhonists with few exceptions.
Of all the groups of the Romance languages, only those among the Spanish supporters of the General Council were Social-Democrats in the present sense of that term.
As for the rest, ha ve those of Geneva proved today that they are worth more than their predecessors? In the same No.
XII ,a you reproduce a large number of anarchist errors and lies, and you accord them a faith wh ich, after my warning, should have lost some of its original naivety.
You promise a second work on this same topic.
I hope that, befo re engaging upon the matter, you will obtain some documents which shed light on the assertions and machinations of the anarchists, and which will certainly enable you to judge impartially.
Otherwise you will oblige me to reply again.
It is of little importance what the bourgeois newspapers have to say a bout the old International, but when its history is distorted even in party organs this is quite a different matter.
All that I ask of you is that you should not write about a subject without having studied both sides, the documents on this side and on that.
Our worker public has to snatch from its meals and its sleep the few hours that it can devote to reading: it therefore has the right to ask that everything we present should be the result of conscientious work, and not lead to futile controversies that it is impossible to follow.
a A mistake in the original.
Should read ‘X II I’.
The reference is to article XII I.
Dear August, I continue.
Aveling’s verbal accounts have reinforced a suspicion pre- viously entertained by me, namely that Keir Hardie nurtures the secret wish to lead the new party 114 in the same dictatorial fashion as Parnell led the Irish, and that his sympathies inclin e more towards the Conservative than towards the Liberal opposition party.
He has said openly that, come the next elections, there should be a repetition of Parnell’s experiment whereby he forced Gladstone to toe the line and that where no Labour candidate can be put up, people should vote Conservative by way of giving the Liberals a taste of their power.
120 Now this is a policy which, in certain circumstances, I myself have demanded of the English, but to proclaim something of this sort in advance, not as a possible tactical measure, but as tactics to be pursued no matter what the circumstances smacks strongly of Champion.
Especially when, at the same time, Keir Hardie refers disparagingly to the extension of the suffrage and other reforms, which alone might be expected to give reality to working-class suffrage over here, as purely political matters which must take second place after social demands—e ight hours, industrial safety, etc.
Though, renouncing as he does their enforcementhy Labour M.
P.
s, he fails to explain how these social demands are to be implemented unless by grace of the middle classes, or else by means of indirect pressure exerted by Labour’s casting vote in the elections.
I draw your attention to this knotty point in order that you may be informed shoul d occasion arise.
For the time being I do not attach any particular importan ce to the matter since at the very interest in, and wax i ndignant over, the fleecing on the ‘Change of the Junkers, manufacturers and petty bourgeois is to suggest that the workers should resort to arms to protect the possession by their own immediate exploiters of the surplus value they have filched from those self-same workers.
What an idea! But as the finest fruit of bourgeois society, as the breeding ground of extreme corruption, as the forcing house of the Panama 60 and other scandals—and hence, too, as a first-class means for the concentration of capitals, for the disintegration and dissolution of the last remnants of natural cohesion in bourgeois society and, at the same time, for the destruction of all obligatory moral concepts and their inversion into their opposite—as an incomparable element of destruction, as the most powerful accelerator of impending revolution—in this historical sense the Stock Exchange is indeed of immediate interest to us.
I see the Centre 71 has moved that there be a stay of prescription for the period in which the Reichstag suspends prosecutions.
Since the Centre is the dominant party the motion seems likely to be carried.
121 Should this happen, it would seem to me inappropriate to make the government a gratuitous present of the above limitation of parliamentary rights without any quid pro quo.
The quid pro quo should consist in the express acknowl- a Vorwärts, No.
17, 20 January 1893 As I have said before, in the next war England will play a dominant role on account of its naval supremacy.
124 And as it happens, England has just played a nasty trick on the French in Egypt.
125 To gain England’s support, in the present state of tension between the two governments, there would have to be a casus belli which, even to your philistine, would seem a gross provocation, and this Caprivi will not provide.
The more information I gather on this point, the more I am struck by the fact that Bismarck formed the Austrian resp.
Triple Alliance.
126 simply in order that he might, on the eve of the now inevitable war, give Austria to Russia in exchange for France: Leave me France and I’ll leave you Austria and Turkey and, what’s more, unleash Italy against Austria via Trieste and Trient.
a And he clearly imagined he would pull it off.
Reflect for a while on the course of history since 1878 127 and you will, I believe, come round to my view.
To me Tutzauer’s hire-purchas e speech in the Reichstag Report (Vorwärts) of the 21st is quite incomprehensible.
He wasn’t speaking as a Social Democrat but as a furniture salesman.
128 How could this have hap- pened? The Young 129 will be overjoyed.

Dear Mme Mendelson, Would you be so kind as to send me another half-dozen copies of the circular in reply to the one issued by Free Russia? I would like to send it to my friends in Germany and elsewhere; perhaps you would be so good as to tell me if it has been sent to Bebel and Vorwärts.
Is there a printing error on page 1, line 4? Is Dragomanov recommending the Polonisation of Lithuania, or its colonisation (by Russian colonists)? Friendly greetings from myself and Mme Kautsky.
Sincerely yours, F.
Engels Mme Kautsky is suffering from a cold and an attack of neuralgia, oth- a Kautsky London, 26 January 1893 Dear Baron, Gine has just told me that you are awaiting an answer from me about Marx’s biography.
130 It had in fact escaped my mind that this was urgent.
Please accept my apologies.
I wouldn’t know what to add to the material you mentioned—unless perhaps one or two bits from the sketcha in the Handwörterbuch der Staatswissenschaften that was sent to you.
Elster—a cousin of Conrad Schmidt’s who referred him to me—asked me to write something for him, which I did, wholly from our own standpoint, all unsuspecting that be would print it—after he had deleted a few excessively unbourgeois passages.
Well, it’s all one to me.
The matter of the Neue Zeit has, of course, been shelved for the time being on account of Dietz’s treatment, apart from the fact of your having spoken to August.
b He says it is impossible to revert to a monthly.
In which case the external arrangements will doubtless remain pretty well unaltered—and it is up to the editors to make the paper more meaty and more amusing for its readers.
At all events it seems to me that any drastic change will have to be put off until Dietz is fit for work again.

Dear Madame Mendelson, A thousand thanks for the trouble you have taken to translate the two articles for me.
137 As for the warning —ostrzezenie —I had already deci- phered it with the help of a Polish dictionary that I inherited from Marx.
And the Gazeta Robotnicza has really been of unexpect ed assistance in my Polish studies—you say that the Polish in this newssheet is too German.
Then it is like the Russian of Lavrov, and that explains why the Russian of the one and the Polish of the other present me with so few difficulties.
I am indeed making progress, and if I had time to apply myself seriously to it for three months, I would venture to garble in Polish.
I will try to make use of your manuscripts—in the meantime I would ask you to let me know if I may publish the facts contained in your letter on the Moscow students and Russian officers—without, of course, revealing the source of my information.

Dear Comrade, My best thanks for your kind hope that I should attain my nineties.
If I remained as I am now, I should have no objection but were I, like so many, to degenerate physically and mentally as well, I would really rather not.
Were that the case, I should prefer to be counted out.
As to your requests regarding Marx’s biography, 140 I am afraid that there is little I can do to meet them.
Moreover I lack the time, being engaged on the 3rd volume of Capital and unable to take time off from it.
Ada I.
There is nothing I can recommend over and above the biographical material already in your possession.
Nothing reliable, at any rate.

Marx’s practical activities betw een 1844 and 1849 were in part devoted to the working men’s associati ons, especially the Brussels associa- tion between 1846 and 1848, and to the League.
141 It is only on these last that you will find anything in print, namely in our prefaces to the Manifesto (LATEST Berlin edition, 1892) and in the Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial along with my introductiona thereto, Zurich edition, a as to supply particulars of the contents is an impossible task.
Nor would it do any good to write out for you the main passa ges.
You must be familiar with the whole.
It surely ought to be possible to pick one up in Berlin.
As to the genesis of historical materialism, you will, in my opinion, find everything you want in my Feuerbach (Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy) —the appendix by Marx is, of course, itself the genesis! Also in the prefaces to the Manifesto (new Berlin edition, 1892) and to the Revelations Concerning the Communist Trial.
Marx quietly elaborated the theory of surplus value in the fifties, all on his own, and resolutely refused to publish anything on the subject until he was in absolutely no doubt about each of his conclusions.
Hence the non- appearance of the 2nd and subsequent instalments of A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy.
142 I am sending you the Splits and Alliance by post and hope these will suffice.
Unfortunately that is all I can do for you.

London, 9 February 1893 Dear August, First of all my congratulations on y our magnificent speech of 3 February which had already given us enormous pleasure in the Vorwärtsa excerpt but came out even better in the stenographic report.
It is a masterpiece, in no way impaired by one or two minor theoreti cal inaccuracies, these being inevitable in verbal delivery.
You are quite right to arrange for copies of the speech to be distributed in their hundreds of thousands,b notwithstanding and in addition to the distribution of the whole debate in pamphlet form.
c This debate, in which the worthy bourgeois sought to dispel the tedium of sittings that had grown arid—thanks to their intrigues behind the scenes— and also, whenever chance offered, to lead us nicely up the garden path, has turned out to be a truly colossal victory for us.
And that they themselves sense this is borne out by the fact th at after Liebknecht ‘s speech they had had enough and indicated as much—through Stoecker! 143 So now at last the gentlemen have realised that if a parliament devotes it- a No.

polemically.
In short, it has been a triumph.
The Witcha was so overjoyed that yesterday she called me Agnes Pinchpenny, whereupon I drew her attention to the fact that she was a proper Fidgety Ann, as anyone who knows her will confirm.
She is even worse than the latter, for its not so much her legs that are fidgety but her brain.
145 There is much to be said for your suggestions as to what the best plan for the Russians would be in case of war.
146 But don’t forget that if the overthrow of France would be intolerable to Russia, the suppression of Germany would be no less so to Italy and England.
Every localised war is more or less subject to control by the neutrals.
The next war, if it comes at all, will not permit of being localised in any way.
They—the Continentals at any rate—would all be drawn in during the first months, it would au- tomatically begin in the Balkans and England at most might be able to remain neutral for a time.
Your Russian plan, however, presupposes a localised war and that, given the enorm ous armies of today and the appalling consequences for the vanquished, I no longer regard as possible.
In Egypt it is simply a case of the Russians (the French are mere puppets on strings) making things difficult for the English, and thereby tying up their troops and fleet as much as possible.
If war broke out, Russia would then have something to offer the English in return for an alliance a jocular name for Louise Kautsky some encouragement, saying that if he would only go ahead and stick it out with the Prussians, he would probably discover that the army also had its good sides.
Later on, at Spichern, 148 when in command of a company, he greatly distinguished hi mself by occupying on hi s own initiative a railway tunnel in defiance of his major.
In the General Staff’s historya he is mentioned in most glowing terms—one of the very few lieutenants of whom it makes any mention at all.
Since then I have read various strategic-political essays of his—most of them on the East—in which there are some very good things along with others (political) with which I don’t agree.
At all events he is an efficient officer—if it’s the same man.
By the way, a compromise seems more probable than ever.
Even the Free Thinkers 149 and the Centre 71 are prepared to supply 28,000 men, while Bennigsen is offering 40,000.
No doubt so many will fall by the wayside that the government will get 50,000 rather than the 60,000 it wanted (perhaps also just a few more, provided it doesn’t waver) 76 and the bourgeois fatherland will once again be saved from dissolution and conflict.
The ‘ball’ was thought up by our charming Witch’s fidgety brain.
The ‘Society’ 62 gave a concert which was followed by a ball.
At 11 o’clock the first part of the concert ended, whereupon I obediently took my leave, a Der deutsch-französische Krieg 1870-71.

suspected of spying, were able to travel to Königsberg without hindrance.
In the opinion of people on the far side of the border this gadding about on German territory is purely and simply for the purpose of spying out the outer forts sited between the East Prussian lakes, on which occasions our overwise Prussian Landrat is only too pleased to be made use of by his Russo- Bohemian friend.
The arrogant Prussi an bureaucrats are everywhere easily taken in.
Moreover the Russian troops on the border were not long ago the recip- ients of a whole load of literature, to wit numerous copies of a pamphlet by Alexandrov, a lieutenant in the artillery in Tashkent, On the causes and necessity of the impending war.
a One copy has been i ssued to each company in order that the officers ma y duly enlighten their men.
Perhaps you might be able to make use of this information in your private conversations with the people on the Military Committee.
Over here Keir Hardie has moved an amendment on the subject of unemployment 151 to the Address (Reply to the Speech from the Throneb) in Parliament.
In itself this was quite a good thing.
But Keir Hardie committed two colossal blunders.
1.
The amendmen t was formulated quite unnecessarily as a direct vote of censure on the government, so that its acceptance would have forced the government to resign and thus the whole thing was tantamount to a Tory manoeuvre, 2.

Just give K.
Hardie enough time and the consequences of his policy will rebound on him personally and become evident to all.
Burns has gone to Halifax to agitate in connection with the elections and consequently did not vote on Keir Hardie’s motion.
For it is by-election time in Huddersfield and Halifax, two manufacturing towns in Yorkshire, each of more th an 100,000 inhabitants.
The Independent Labour Party has put up a candidateb in Halifax, as have the other two parties.
Then it made the following offer to the Liberals: If you withdraw your candidate in Halifaxc so that we only have the Toryd to contend with, we’ll vote for you in Huddersfield.
The Liberals refused.
Whereupon the LIBERAL WAS DEFEATED LAST TUESDAY IN HUDDERSFIELDe by the Toryf—as a result of the Independent Labour Party’s abstention, Again, at another by- election in Burnley, Lancashire, not far from Halifax, the Liberals polled 750 fewer votes than in the previous electi on—also as a result of our abstention.
The poll in Halifax is being held today and the Tory will probably be elected.
That would bring Gladstone’s majority, now 36, down to 34.

My correspondence in the meantime is suspended and my rack is full, cram-full of unanswered letters from all quarter s, reaching from Rome to New York and from Petersburg to Texas; so if I snatch a moment to write to you, it’s only because it’s you and no one else.

Of course as long as he nurses it, he will not get well, the beast will eat him up.
And why in the name of goodness does he travel thus? Nobody out of France can make it out that he and others allow this splendid opportunity to slip out of their hands.

And only three speakers on our side at all—Bebel spoke twice, Frohme and Liebknecht—and the bourgeois had to leave us the last word and give it up in despair (for we could stop the clôturef by a simple count out, there never being the quorum of 201 present).

Gladstone has accepted them in principle.
Again, it’s a great advantage that there should be only one electoral register, i.

only one suffrage, for all public elections, and the importance of this is enhanced by the fact that there is another Bill in sight for the setting up of Parish (over here rural parishes) Councils 163 which will eliminate the last traces of what has hitherto been a semi-feudal system in country districts.
If all this goes through and becomes law during this session, the political position of the working class will be materially improved, which is in itself an added incentive for the chaps to make the most of that new position.
However many intrigues and blunders there may be over here, and these will be legion, there can be no doubt that tremendous progress is being made, and in a few years’ time you may already find cause for surprise in the English.

And, January 27th, you express the same idea in this form: the grande industriec had become a necessity for Russia, but was it unavoidable that it was developed in a capitalistic form? Well, in, or about, 1854 Russia started with the commune on the one hand, and the necessity of the grande industrie on the other.
Now, if you take the whole state of your count ry into account, as it was at that date, do you see any possibility of the grande industrie being grafted on the peasants’ commune in a form which would, on the one hand, make the development ofthat grande industrie possible, and on the other hand raise the primitive commune to the rank of a social institution superior to anything the world has yet seen? And that while the whole Occidentd was still living under the capitalist régime?.
It strikes me that such an evolution, which would have surpassed anything known in history, required other ec onomical, political and intellectual conditions than were present at that time in Russia.
No doubt the commune and to a certain extent the artel, contained germs which under certain conditions might ha ve developed and saved Russia the necessity of passing through the torments of the capitalistic ré- a of Section VI (see present edition, Vol.
37) - b Literally: let’s return to our muttons; an expression from the French medieval farce, m eaning: let’s return to the subject of our conversation.
- c large-scale industry - d West those economic consequences of the capitalistic system which must bring it up to the critical point, are only just now developing in the various countries about us: while England is fast losing her industrial monopoly, France and Germany are approaching the industrial level of England, and America bids fair to drive them all out of the world’s market both for industrial and for agricultural produce.
The introduction of an, at least relative, free trade policy in America is sure to complete the ruin of England’s industrial monopoly, and to destroy, at the same time, the industrial export trade of Germany and France; then the crisis must come, tout ce qu’il y a de plus fin de siècle.
d But in the meantime, with you, the commune fades away, and we can only hope that the change to a better system, with us, may come soon enough to save, at least in some of the remoter portions of your country, institutions which may, under these circumstances, be called upon to fulfil a great future, But facts are facts, and we must not forget th at these chances are getting less and less every year.

There is not a debate, no matter what the subject, in which we do not intervene and we are listened to by all the parties.
The debate on the socialist organisation of the future lasted five days, 143 and Bebel’s speechc was wanted in three and a half million copies.
Now they are having the whole debate published in pamphlets’ 1 at five sous, and the effect, already tremendous, will be doubled! You are absolutely right to prepare for the elections.
We ought to conquer at least 20 seats.
You have the immense advantage of knowing, from the municipal elections, the minimum extent of your strength in each locality; for I am sure that, since last May, you have appreciably increased it.
170 That will help you greatly in distributing candidatures between yourselves and the Radical Socialists.
But possibly you would prefer to put up your candidates wherever you stand a chance, with the proviso to withdraw them, if necessary, in favour of the Radicals, for the second ballot, in the event of the latter having polled more votes.

against the Republicans, it is to the cowardice of the Radical Republicans 86 that they will owe this tr iumph.
You say that the republic is not in danger, that the deputies have returned from the recess with this certainty; well, then, they should strike for all they are worth and not let themselves be confused with the robbers by their silence.
Y ou are quite right: th e political ineptitude of the whole bourgeoisie defies the imagination.
The only country where the bourgeoisie still has a little common sense is England.
Here the formation of the Independent Labour Party 114(though still in embryo) and its conduct in the Lancashire and Yorkshire electionsa have put a match to the government’s backside; it is stirring itself, doing things unheard-of for a Liberal Government.
The Registration Bill 162 unifies the suffrage for all parliamentary, municipal, etc.
, elections, 2) adds at least 20 to 30 per cent to the working-class vote, 3) removes the cost of election expenses from the candidates’ shoul ders and places it on those of the government.
The payment of an honorarium to M.
P.

In short, the Liberals recognise that, to make sure of governing at the present time, they can do nothing but increase the political power of the working class who will naturally kick them out afterwards.

even if he is engaged in an attempt to abolish that office.
One might consider that the best wa y to abolish the Presidency and the Senate in America would be to elect to those posts men who had pledged themselves to bring about their abolition; it would then be logical for one to act accordingly.
Others might consider this method to be inexpedient; it’s a debatable point.
There could be circumstances in which such a mode of action might also involve a denial of the revolutionary principle; why it should always and invariably be so, I entirely fail to see.
For the first objective of the labour m ovement is the conquest of political power for and by the working class.
Once we are agreed on that, differences of opinion between upright men, in full command of their wits, as to the ways and means of struggle are unlikely to give rise to a dispute over principles.
In my view the best tactics in any given country are those which lead most quickly and surely to the goal.
But in America in particular that goal is still a very long way off, and I believe I woul d not be wrong in attributing to this very circumstance the importance which is still sometimes attached to such academic issues over there.

We shall return on Fridayc to London.
On Saturday Louise and I have both promised to speak at the joint Commune Celebration of the Verein 62 and Bloomsbury Society 181—a joint festival, though I’d rather have a good butcher’s joint.
The Sunday following is the Brussels Conference 172—that is to say the second Sunday following, viz.
the 26th; you do not say whether Paul will be there though it would be very important, on account of certain intrigues carried on by the old clique Hyndman-Brousse-Allemane, supported, for the time being, by Seidel, the secretary of the Zurich Committee 182 ; evidently a last attempt is going to be made by this bro- kendown lot to prepare for themselves a more favourable position at the Congress.
From Brussels, Bebel 183 is almost certain to come to London for a few days and maybe Liebknecht too.
Now I should be uncommonly glad to ha ve Paul and Bebel here together for a few days in order to do away once for all with certain French prejudices against Bebel who is by far the best man we have in Germany, in spite of what the French may consider his Teutonic rudeness.
So you see I have a special interest of a political character, besides the personal one, in your showing up here early in the week.
I do not at all object to a tour de France made by Paul in an organised electoral campaign; on th e contrary I consider it a capital move.

XXIX, Moscow, 1946 Published in English for the first time a Stanislaw Mendelson - b 18 March you with the greatest pleasure, were it not that all my time is at present taken up with the manuscript of the third book of my late friend Karl Marx’s great work on Capital, which I am preparing for publication.
This third book ought to have been out years ago; but never until now could I secure that continued freedom from interruption which alone will enable me to finish my task.
I have been compelled to decline all outside work, though ever so tempting, unless absolutely necessary.
By the time your congress meets, the MS ought to go to press, but this could not be, were I to accede to your request.
For the work you ask me to do ought not to be journalistic commonplace; it ought to be the very best I can furnish, it w ould require mature study and thought; and that means a considerable amount of time, which for the reasons given, I am not in a position to sacrifice.
I have, however, forwarded you per bookpost a copy of the English edi- tion of the Communist Manifesto of 1848 (by K.
Marx and myself) and another of my Socialism: Utopian and Scientifica published a few months ago, as a small tribute which I hope may prove of interest to some members of your Labor Congress.

Aveling and published in London in 1892 Lafargues will be coming at the same time and I am glad to have again inveigled the young man over here so that he and I can discuss French affairs at some length.
All the same I ought s till to have enough time left to finish off Volume II P since I am now over the worst.
The matter of the Socialiste has now been settled.
It would seem that a crash is the only solution to the silver business in America.
187 For Cleveland does not, it seems, have either the strength or the courage to smash this vicious circle of corruption.
And it really would be a good thing if there were to be a crisis.
A nation—a young nation—so proud of its ‘practice’ and at the same time so frightfully bone-headed in the matter of theory as America can only eradicate so ingrained an idée fixe at the cost of damage to itself.
The plausible idea that, if one has no money when one needs it, this is because there is not enough money in the world at large, is a childish notion common both to the PAPER CURRENCY nonsense à la Kellogg and to the silver nonsense, and the sure st cure for it is experimentation and bankruptcy which last might also prove quite beneficial to ourselves in other respects.
Provided only some sort of tariff reform is achieved this autumn, there will be no need for you to repine, for the rest will surely follow.
The main thing is that American industry is becoming capable of competing on the world market.
Over here things are going very well.
The masses are undoubtedly on the move, and of this you will find details in Aveling’s admittedly somewhat long-winded reports in the Volkszeitung.
The best evidence of this a of Capital Lancashire and Yorkshire are again taking the lead.
Men like Sidney Webb, Bernard Shaw, etc.
, who WANTED TO PERMEATE THE LIBERALS WITH SOCIALISM , must now submit to being permeated BY THE SPIRIT OF THE WORKINGMEN MEMBERS OF THEIR OWN SOCIETY .
They fret and fume but IT’S NO USE —either they remain on their own, officers without soldiers, or they conform.
The first seems more likel y and is also more desirable.
The Independent Labour Party 114—as the latest arrival—has brought with it fewer ingrained prejudices, contains good elements, the working men of the North being the arbiters, and to that extent is the most genuine expression of the present movement, True, there are amongst the leaders all kinds of odd individuals and even many of the best, as in America where you are, have acquired the parliamentary system’s deplorable habit of cliquism, but they have the support of the masses who will e ither teach them how to behave or throw them overboard.
They still make blunders and plenty of them, but the worst perils are over and I now look for rapid progress which will not be without its repercussions in America.
In Germany the situation has almost r eached crisis point.
According to the last reports on the sessions of the Military Committee a compromise would hardly seem possible.
76 The government is making it impossible for the gentlemen of the Centre 71 and the Free Thinkers 149 to change sides,a and a majority cannot be obtained without 40 or 50 of their number.

The masses, especially in the North, in the industrial areas, are finally and indubitably on the move.
Blunders and dirty tricks there will still be in plenty, but that can be dealt with.
The day before yesterday Aveling was in Manchester where the Executive of the Independent Labour Party were holding their first meeting.

Last December Dr Gumpert suddenly went down with an incurable heart complaint and on the 20th of this month he died of it.
Last Mondaya I attended the burial, or rather cremation, in Manchester.
Unfortunately I had to get back the same day and thus missed the chance of looking up Siebold or Klepsch and could not therefore glean any further information on the subject of the estate.
This is another matter that will be adversely affected by Gumpert’s death.
He was an energetic man who, especially in the case of the ailing Siebold, managed successfully to hurry things on, and, in view of the friendly relations we had enjoyed for many years, was glad to be of help.
I have heard absolutely nothing more about the manuscripts and publisher’s contracts.

201 Maybe I shall come upon it tucked away somewhere, if ever I get round to sorting out and classifying the chaotic mass of stuff, but of that there can be no question unless I have three or four weeks to devote to it.
All I can find is in Eichhoff’s pamphlet on the International, Berlin, 1868 (based on notes and material of Marx’s); p.
53 reads: ‘Lincoln’s re-election on 8 November 1864 wa s an occasion for the General Council to send him an address with its best wishes.
At the same time, it called mass meetings in support of the Union’s cause.
That was why Linc oln, in his message of reply, expressly acknowledged the services of the Internati onal Working Men’s Association for the good cause.

and struggle which means that the thing has got to be finished before then.
What my views are concerning German affairs you can see from the interview in Le Figarod which I am sending you by the same post as this.
As in all interviews, the text has in parts become somewhat insipid and the thread sometimes gets lost, but otherwise it has been correctly reported.
The morale of our people in Germany is alt ogether excellent; so far as they are concerned, the election campaign is a real boon and they revel in it, despite all the trouble and effort it costs them.
Bebel, who spent a week here at Eastertime 183—after the Brussels Conference 172—is a new man and writes to say that; in addition to Hamburg, he ha s been asked to stand for Strasbourg in Alsace where in 1890 we had 4,800 votes as against 8,200, and where a lot of the Francophils will vote for him.
There are between a hundred and a hundred and ten constituencies in which we shall be kicking off with more than one third of the total poll (to go by the 1890 results) and in some eighty of the constituencies we shall, I think, either get in straight away or else in the second ballot.
How many will fall by the wayside in the latter depends on the opposition candidate.
Against Conservatives 202 or National Liberals 203 our chances are very good, less so against Freisinnige 149 and still less so against the Centre a Johann Philipp Becker - b of Capital- c Sections VI and VII (see present edition, Vol.
37) - d Interview of Frederick Engels to the correspondent of Le Figaro on 11 May 1893 went according to plan and we—the Eight Hour Day Committee—drew a far bigger crowd than the combined oppos ition.
Our international platform, 205 in particular, was very well attended.
I would estimate that there were in all 240,000 people in the park, of w hom we had 140,000 and the opposition 100,000 at the outside.
Champion, with his TORY and LIBERAL UNIONIST funds 206 (allegedly £100 for each of the 100 working-class candi dates agreeing to stand in hopeless constituencies merely in order to deprive the Liberals of votes), has been made a thorough fool of by our old friend Maltman Barry.
This blockhead, if Scottish speculator, has joined the Tories of whom, by his own admission,a he is the paid agent, and would seem to have been planted alongside Champion, whom the fund-dispensing Tories do not altogether trust, as a sleeping partner and watchdog—what the Jesuits call a socius.
Thus, during Champion’s illness, he was sole editor of the Labour Elector, and told such improbable tales out of school that he quite spoiled his own little game, thus temporarily saving the Independent Labour Party 114 from becoming the pawn of the aforesaid gentry.
Unfortunately Aveling has been seriously ill for a month now; in view of the constant caballing that goes on here, he cannot well be spared.

Hourwich Dear Sir, Many thanks for your interesting study on the Economics of the Russian Village,a which I read, I hope, not without profit.
As to the burning questions of the Russian revolutionary movement, the part which the peasantry may be effected to take in it, these are subjects on which I could not conscientiously state an opinion for publication without previously studying over again the whole subject and completing my very imperfect knowledge of the facts of the case by bringing it up to date.
210 But for that I am sorry to say I have not at present the time.
And then, I have every reason to doubt whether such a public statement by me would have the effect you expect of it.
I know from my own experience of 1849-52 how unavoidably a political emigration splits itself up into a number of divergent factions, so long as the mother-country remains quiet.
The burning desire to act, face to face with the impossibility of a I.

The resistance put up by the Richters and Liebers is, in f act, a very half-hearted and ineffectual affair and, should we gain the victories—in numbers of votes polled, seats being of lesser importance—which this disarray seems to promise, that resistance might collapse altogether.

5, Moscow, 1965 Published in English for the first time 92 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE AT LE PERREUX London, 20 June 1893 My dear Löhr, I was glad to conclude from your letter that there was still time to insert, in your Rave amendé et corrigé,a such of my suggested alterations a amended and corrected 3,200 Metz ones for Liebknecht, beside s odds and ends all over the country.
Bebel who has been there several times lately is quite in love with the Alsatian working men and with the country altogether, although at Strasburg last Sunday fortnight they nearly smothered him bodily with their enthusiasm in Hammerle’s beer-garden.
Our elections went off glorious.
204 In 1890—20 seats, now 24 carried at the first assault; in 1890—about 60 ballottage s, this time 85.
Of seats we lost two and gained six new ones; of the 85 ballots, there are 38 in which, in 1890, we did not get into the ballot (only the two candidates with the highest number of votes are admitted to ballot); and of the 85, there are also 38 in which we have chances (in the remaining 47 we are in a hopeless minority, unless miracles happen) and out of these 38 we may reasonably expect 25 successful elections.
But the gap cause d by the complete break-up of the Radical (Freisinnige) Partei 223 has created such a state of confusion that we must be prepared for a series of surprises; amongst the Radicals, party discipline has ceased to exist and the pe ople in each locality will just act as they think fit.
By bringing up our full strength at second ballot by the assistance of the bourgeois democrats in South Germany and of the mutual jealousies and bickerings of the other parties, we shall be able to come up again to the old complement of 36, a is set up - b French name: Mulhouse and English bourgeois press.
And well it may be.
Such a steady, unbroken, resistless progress of a party has never been seen in any country.
And the best of it is that our increase of 1893 involves—by the extent and variety of the newly broken ground it shows—the certain promise of a far greater increase at the next general election.
The new departure of the parti ouvriera with regard to ‘patriotism’ is very rational in itself 1’; international union can exist only between nations, whose existence, autonomy and independence as to internal matters is therefore included in the very term of interna tionality.
And the pressure of the pseudo- patriots, sooner or later, was certain to provoke an utterance of this kind, even without the alliance with Millerand and Jaurès 169 who no doubt have also urged the necessity of such an act.
Guesde’s interview in the Figaro 224 is excellent, not a word to be said against it.

Gumpert (you know Dr.

Good luck to the everlasting traveller.

Particularly on the eve of a general election 156 it is impossible to leave the field wide open to slander.
So we are agreed on this point; the Germans have done as much on more than one occasion, to the great distress of Bonnier who moves in an idealistic anti-patriotic sphere (though mainly anti-patriotic for others, since no one wishes more than he that ‘France should take the lead in the movement’).
And here is the National Council uncompromisingly declaring itself patriotic—and at the very moment when the elections in Germany 204 quite as uncompromisingly prove that it is not France which is taking the lead at present—poor Bonnier, he was here on Sunday, and looked quite abashed.
Your declaration will have its effect in France, I hope, and I hope with a A phrase from the ceremonial speech during the election of the Pope - b jocular name for Engels towards Blanquism, i.

, towards the theory that France is destined to play the same role in the proletarian revolution (not merely that of initiator but also that of leader) as it played in the bourgeois revolution of 1789-98.
This is contrary to the economic and political facts of today.
The industrial development of France has lagged behind th at of England; at this juncture it is behind that of Germany which has made giant strides since 1860; the working-class movement in France today cannot be compared to that of Germany.
But it is not the French, nor the Germans, nor the British who, by themselves, will win the glory of having crushed capitalism; if France— PERHAPS —gives the signal, it will be in Germany, the country most profoundly influenced by socialism and where the theory has the most deeply penetrated the masses—where the fight will be settled, and even then neither France nor Germany will ensure final vi ctory so long as England remains in the hands of the bourgeoisie.
Proletarian emancipation can be only an international deed; if you try to turn it into a purely French deed you are making it impossible.
The exclusively French leadership of the bourgeois revolution—albeit inevitable, thanks to the stupidity and cowardice of the other nations—led to—do you know what?—to Napoleon, to conquest, to the invasion of the Holy Alliance.
To try and assign the same role to France in the future is to distort the international proletarian movement, as, indeed, the Blanquists do, and make France look ridiculous, for beyond your frontiers such pretensions are made fun of.
live the Republic’ on the day after Panama, 60 you will find a single supporter in the whole of Europe.
The republican form is no more than the simple negation of monarchy—and the overthrow of the monarchy will be accomplished simply as a corollary to revolution; in Germany the bourgeois parties are so bankrupt that we shall pass at once from monarchy to the social republic.
Hence you cannot go on opposing your bourgeois republic to the monarchies as something to which othe r nations should aspire.
Your republic and our monarchies are all one in relation to the proletariatb; if you help us against our monarchist bourgeois, we shall help you against your republican bourgeois.
It’s a case of reciprocity and by no means the deliverance of the downtrodden Monarchists by the gr eat-hearted French Republicans; this doesn’t tally with the international outlook and even less with the historical situation which has brought your republic to the feet of the tsar.
Don’t forget that, if France makes war on Germany in the interests and with the help of the tsar, it is Germany which will be the revolutionary centre.
But there is another very regrettable affair.
You are ‘at one with German Social-Democ racy against the German Empire’.

’ painful argument.
To sum up: a little more reciprocity could do no harm—equality between nations is as necessary as that between individuals.
On the other hand, your manner of speaking of the republic as a desirable thing in itself for the proletariat, and of France as the chosen people, prevents you mentioning the—unpleasant but undeniable—fact of the Russian alliance, or rather the Russian vassalage.
Well, that’s enough, I think.
I hope I have convinced you that in the first flush of your renascent patriotism you have overshot the mark a little.
Not that it is very important and I hope the thing will go by without raising a dust, but should it recur it might lead to unpleasant controversies.
Your published documents, though intended for France, must also PASS MUSTER abroad.
If it comes to that, our worthy Germans have not always been correct either, in all their expressions.
As for the German elections, I am prouder of the defeats than of the successes.
We have lost Stuttgart by a minority of 128 votes out of 31,000 electors, Lübeck by 154 out of 20,000, and so on.
On this occasion all the parties formed a coalition against us; even the democrats of the South, who left us in the lurch at Stuttgart, at Mannheim, at Pforzheim, at Speyer and voted for us only in Frankfurt.
What we won we owe—for the first time— entirely to our own strength.

I have compared some passages, particularly in the 1st and penultimate chapters (general tendenc y of capitalist accumulation).
As you say, it is translated entirely from the French text, which continues to be more popular than the German.
The passages I compared were translated fairly accurately, which is not very difficult given that the two languages are so closely related, and the greater freedom of movement offered by Italian in comparison to French.

He tr anslates for me with a fanaticism worthy of a better cause; but it seems he has little success in business affairs, and an unlucky star has followed him everywhere.
Will we see each other in Zurich? 189 Good Lord, if all goes well I might be able to be in Zurich at least for the last day of the Congress; that is my plan; however, as it does not entirely depend on me but on a combination of more or less fortuitous circumstances, it is very uncertain, and we would both probably do well not to speak of it.

151 -c damn -d Milan dialect -e Heartfelt greetings IN BERLIN London, 14 July 1893 Dear Mr Mehring, It has taken me until today to get round to thank you for the Lessing- Legende you were so kind as to send me.
I did not wish merely to send you a formal note acknowledging receipt of the book, but also and at the same time to say something about it—its contents.
Hence the delay.
Let me begin at the end—with the appendix, ‘II ber de n historischen Materialismus’a in which you have brilliantly collated the essentials in a manner that must convince any impartia l reader.
If I have any criticism to make, it is that you accord me more mer it than I deserve, even if one takes account of what I may, perhaps, have found out for myself—in course of time—but which Marx, with his swifter coup d’oeilb and greater discernment, discovered much more quickly.
If one has been fortunate enough to spend forty years collaborating with a man like Marx, one tends, during one’s lifetime, to receive less recognition than one feels is due to one; when the greater man dies, however, the lesser may easily come to be overrated—and that is exactly what seems to have happened in my case; all this will eventually be put right by history, and by then one will be safely out of the way and know nothing at all about it.
a ‘On Historical Materialism’ - b insight both its substance and its form as deriving solely from thought—either his own or that of his predecessors.
He wo rks solely with conceptual material which he automatically assumes to ha ve been engendered by thought without inquiring whether it might not have some more remote origin unconnected therewith; indeed, he takes this for granted since, to him, all action is induced by thought, and therefore appears in the final analysis, to be motivated, by thought.
The historical ideologist (here historical is used as an omnibus term for political, legal, philosophical, theologi cal, in short, for all spheres ap- pertaining to society and not merely to nature)—the historical ideologist, then, possesses in every sphere of scie nce a material which has originated independently in the thought of previ ous generations and has undergone an independent course of development of its own in the brains of these successive generations.
True, external facts appertaining to one sphere or another may also have helped to de termine that development but according to what has been tacitly assumed, those facts, themselves are merely the fruits of a mental process, and thus we still find ourselves in the realm of pure thought which would appear to have succeeded in assimilating even the most recalcitrant facts.

spared five hundred years of misery and folly.
We have all, I believe, neglected this aspect of the matter, which I can only touch on here, to a greater extent than it deserves.
It’s the same old story—initially, form is always neglected in favour of substance.
As I have said, I, too, have done this, never rea lising my mistake until after the event.
Far be it from me, therefore, to reproach you on that score—as the senior culprit I am in no way entitled to do so, quite the contrary—but rather I would draw your attention to this poi nt with a view to future occasions.
Hand in hand with this goes the ideologists’ fatuous conception that, because we deny independe nt historical developmen t to the various ideo- logical spheres which play a role in history, we also deny them any historical efßcacy.
Underlying this is the ordinary, undialectical conception of cause and effect as rigidly opposite poles, quite regardless of any interaction.
The gentlemen forget, often almost deliberatel y, that an historical element, once it is ushered into the world by other, ultimately economic, causes, will react in its turn, and may exert a reciprocal influence on its environment and even upon its own causes.

most effective means to that end.
You would then also be better off as regards space and opportunity when you come to depict local Prussian history as part of the whole German misère.
This is a matter upon which my views differ here and there from your own, notably as regards the conditions responsible for the dismemberment of Germany and the failure of the German bourgeois revolution in the 16th century.
If I get round to revising the introduction to my Peasant War, as I hope to do next winter, I shall be able to enlarge on the points in question.
235 Not that I consider those you adduce to be incorrect, but I should include some others and marshal them rather differently.
I have always found, when studying German history—which is one long, continuous misère —that a true perspective can only be obtained by comparing it with the same periods in France, because what happens there is the exact opposite of what happens in Germany.
There we have the establishment of the national state from the disjecta of the feudal state at the very time of our worst decline.
There, a rare kind of objective logic permeates the whole course of events; in our case, a barren and ever more barren haphazardness.
There, the Englis h conqueror of the Middle Ages, who intervenes in favour of the Provençal nationality as opposed to North French nationality, represents foreign intervention; the English wars are, as it were, the equivalent of the Thirty Years’ War a William I - b scattered members partitioned the whole of the country be tween them, were neither of them purely German but were colonies on captured Slav territory—Austria a Bavarian, and Brandenburg a Saxon, colony; also the fact that they acquired power in Germany only with the support of foreign, non-German possessions—Austria with that of Hungary (not to mention Bohemia), Brandenburg with that of Prussia.
Nothing of the kind happened on the western frontier, more at risk than anywhere else; on the northern frontier it was left to the Danes to protect Germany against the Danes, while in the South there was so little to protect that the frontier guards, the Swiss, were actually able to detach themselves from Germany! But I am divagating—my loquacity can, at any rate, serve you as proof of the extent to which your book has stimulated me.
Once again, many thanks and warm regards from Yours, F.

’ If Caprivi does away with universal suffrage he will destroy a great empire, namely that of the Hohenzollerns.
So you have found violations of the theory and practice of agriculture in Bebel’s Fraua? Well, it is scarcely possible to provide a critique of today’s wasteful and generally uneconomic mana gement of agriculture and industry, along with tips as to how, given the social order that automatically arises out of economic conditions, this could be done differently and better, and at the same time as to how, given shorte r working-hours for each individual, production could be significantly increased—all this, I say, is scarcely possible without exposing oneself to attack by people with a practical knowledge of one branch or another.
Hence Bebel is obviously either expressing himself badly or has failed to understand his authority when he says that the yield of a cornfield can be increased threefold or more by fully exploiting the protein content of gluten.
There can be no question of that.
I could point to a dozen or more minor inaccuracies of a like nature, but they don’t affect the main issue.
Similarly in the case of the trans port of meat from regions overseas.
Hitherto enough has been available for shipment in one form or another to Europe.

each spindle produced what was requi red of it when run for two hours.
Rather, one would keep the spindles running for between ten and twelve hours, while the operatives would only work for two, a new shift being put on every two hours.
Now as to your objection about the poor town dwellers who are spoiled for agricultural work for life, you may ve ry well be right.
I readily admit my inability to plough, sow, reap, or even lift potatoes, but luckily we have in Germany so huge a rural population that by intelligent management we could without more ado drastically redu ce each man’s working hours and still retain supernumeraries.
Supposing we turned the whole of Germany over to farms of between 2,000 and 3,000 morgensa—more or less, depending upon natural conditions—and introduced machinery and every modern improvement, would we not then ha ve more than enough skilled labour amongst the agricultural population? But obviously there is not enough work on the land to keep that population busy throughout the year.
Large numbers would idle away much of their time if we didn’t employ them in industry, just as Our industrial workers would waste away physically if they were denied the opportunity of working in the open air and particularly on the land.
I agree that the present grown-up generation may not be up to it.
But we can train young people to that end.
If, for several successive years, the lads and lasses were to go into the a 0,25 ha with acute as well as chronic distress, with the periodically recurring ruin of whole sections of the population, and likewise with the vast dissipation both of the means of production and of what is produced.
And since we have now fortunately reached a stage at which we can dispense with these worthies the big landowners no less than with the landed peasants, and agriculture, no less than industry, has likewise now reached a stage of development which, in our view, not only admits of, but demands, its appropriation en bloc by society, it is up to us to break the circulus vitiosus.
a To that end the big farms and large manorial estates provide us with a much better opportunity than the small farms, just as in industry large factories are more readily suited to that purpose than small workshops.
And this is reflected in the political sphere in that the rural proletarians on the big estates become Social-Democrats, just like the urban proletarians, once the latte r are able to exert pressure on them, whereas the unsuccessful farmer and urban artisan arrive at Social- Democracy only by the devious route of anti-Semitism.
217 To say that the owner of a manorial estate— LORD or SQUIRE —who has emerged from feudalism, will ever learn to run his affairs as would a bourgeois and, like the latter, be capable of regarding it as his first duty, come what may, to capitalise each y ear a proportion of the surplus value a vicious circle Vienna-Leipzig, 1897 Published in English in full for the first time 98 ENGELS TO LAURA LAFARGUE AT LE PERREUX London, 20 July 1893 My dear Löhr, D’aborda thanks for translation of the Chronicle Interview—though it was hardly worth while.

To-morrow Louise and I are going, for a week, to Eastbourne (address as before, 28 Marine Parade), as I feel the want of a little recruiting of strength before undertaking my trip to Germany.

Will Paul and you be in Zürich? The Swiss got letters from other Parisian organisations, that the elections very likely would not be in August, in spite of all newspaper reports, but only in September; 156 that and the English objections decided against the application for adjournment.

Mme Marx-Aveling is executor under Marx ’s will; as for the literary part of the inheritance, I am responsible.
Neither of us has ever heard talk of any Unione tipografica-editrice of Turin, and even less have we ever sold to this society ‘property rights for the works of Marx’ which (fortunately) belong to us entirely to this day.
Not a single soldo of money from this Union has ever touched our hands.
243 As regards the 1st volume of Capital, these property rights include the German and French editions.
In accord with the relevant international trea- ties, everyone is now free to do any translations; we cannot oppose this.
If anyone asks for our authorisation, this is a purely voluntary act on their part.
It is not altogether impossible that the Union has entered into some kind of contract with the editor of the French edition, M.
Lachâtre, but it is highly unlikely.
I know nothing of it.
However, even if this is the case, M.
Lachâtre could only.
sell that which is his property, and at the very most that was the French edition.
Thus the Union could do no more than oppose an Italian translation from the French.
However, now the book by Deville has been published and is freely circulating in France.

189 I had quite a nice journey.
There were some highly diverting dust storms to begin with, followed by just enough rain to make the dust stick to one’s clothing.
In Zürich they took me to the Hotel Ba ur en ville where I was very well accommodated but never felt at home.
Th en, finally on Saturday evening, with the most difficult part accomplishe d, a moderate carousal gradually got under way (I say moderate advisedly; only half litres were served) combined with excursions on the lake.
Tell Elsbetha that people here have already discovered how talented I am at growling.
The other day Bebel remarked in a postcard that I had done nothing the whole evening but growl with contentment.
Zurich has come on a great deal and outdoes even Barmen.
There ev- a Elsbeth Engels Viennese factory girl,b charming of countenance and engaging of manner, such as one rarely comes across.
I sh all never forgive Bismarck for having excluded Austria from Germany, if onl y because of the Viennese women.
From what they tell me here, the Hotel Bellevue is not one of the best.
I hope it nevertheless suited you all right.
Let me know sometime how you got on.
With much love to Emma,c Elsbeth, Walterd and you yourself from your old ‘weed that never dies’.

As to the elections of yesterday, 208 we are in complete uncertainty and shall be so until this afternoon—no pa pers being published in Zürich on Monday mornings.
So anything to be said on that subject must be delayed until end of this letter.
I found Germany completely metamorphosed.
Steam chimneys all over the country, but where I passed, not numerous enough over a small district, to create a nuisance by their smoke.
Cologne and Mainz are transformed.
The old town is there still where it was, but around or aside of it has arisen a larger and newer town with splendid buildings disposed according to a well- arranged plan, and with large industrial establishments occupying distinct quarters so as not to interfere with the aspect or the comfort of the rest.
Cologne has made most progress, having nearly trebled its inhabitants—the Ring is a splendid street, there is nothing equal to it in all England.
Mainz is growing, but at a slower rate.
In Strasburg you see too distinctly the separation between the old town and the new district formed by university and government buildings, an external addition, not a natural growth.
Paul naturally will be most curious to hear about Alsace.
Well, the French may rest satisfied.
In Strasburg, to my astonishment, I heard nothing but German spoken.
Only once, two girls, Jewesses, who passed me, a Hermann Engels frenchified, and bullied the peasants and workmen, who, at least in language, had retained some remnant of German nationality.
The country is under the thumb of maires,** gendarmes, tax-gatherers, appointed by the central government and mostly imported from abroad, who do as they like and live among themselves, separated from and detested by the people.
All the old oppressive laws of the French Second Empire 248 are scrupu- lously maintained and enforced, and sometimes even improved upon by old ordinances dating from the ancien régime and unearthed by learned functionaries who have discovered that the revolution has forgotten to state expressly that they are repealed! Mo reover, all the chicanery innate to Prussian officials, is imported and improved upon.
The consequences are natural.
When I asked my friend: then , evidently, if the French by some chance or other were to return, nine-t enths of the people would receive them with open arms, he said that was so.
In Strasburg the old bourgeoisie keep quite to themselves and do not mix in any way with the intruders.
With the rest of the people, Bebel is very popular, wherever he was recognised, they came to the shop doors and saluted him.
You may be sure he will bring the state of things in Alsace before the Reichstag in a fashion different from that of those asses of protestataires who seem to rejoice in every fresh measure of oppression, a Modern name: Mulhouse.
** Chief executives, Mayors think they can aggravate ‘les allemands’,b You need not be astonished.
I have heard Swiss Socialists (and the German Swiss have very strong French sympathies) declare that now it was evid ent that chauvinism was ineradicable in the French mind, and I had to tell them what things—gall and wormwood to every chauvinc- had been able to say in French in your Almanac,d without any bad results anywhere.
So you see the fiasco of these spouters falls upon all France, our people included.
And Jaclard with his peevish articles in Justice makes it worse still.
Well, I hope the elections will put us in a position to show to all Europe that Jaclard and Allemane ne sont pas la France.
e And yet I believe Jaclard voted in very many cases with Bonnier and the small vanishing minority.
The women were splendidly represented.
Besides Louise, Austria sent little Dworzak, a charming little girl in every respect; I fell quite in love with her and whenever Labriolaf gave me a chance, eloped with her from the entanglements of his ponderous conversation.

I had been for 6 days in the Berner Oberland with August and St.
Mendelson— fine weather and splendid scenery.
189 The Jungfrau had put on an extra clean white night-dress for us.
Jungfrau, Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa are the three finest massifs of the whole Alps.
Yesterday we were on the Uetliberg, a hill close to Zurich, with a fine though rather distant view of the snowy chain.
When, after 1870, old Thiers was here with his lot, he at once explained the whole to them; pointing at the Glärnisch (due South-East of the Uetli) he said that was the Mont Blanc.
The landlord of the hôtel at the top, a perfect connoisseur of the whole range, ventured to suggest that this was the Glärnisch, and that the Mont Blanc was in a nearly opposite direction, and i nvisible from that point—but the little man replied: Monsieur, je suis Adolphe Thiers, et je dois savoir cela! C’est bien là le Mont Blanc!a I am glad you consider the re sult of the elections of the 20th a victory.
Let us hope this will be confirmed next Sunday by the return of Paul and Delcluze besides some others.
Otherwise I am afraid our party will not be able to play the part in the Palais Bourbon 156 which I and many others wish it to play.
If a Sir, I am Adolphe Thiers and I should know this! I can assure you that is Mont Blanc! as far as they interest us.
As soon as you can, but not later than Tuesday afternoon, please telegraph the names of our men and the places for which they have been returned, and if the money goes so far, any further information of interest.
The telegram to be addressed in German: Bebel, Hotel Deutscher Kaisert Munich: but the rest had perhaps better be in French, so as to secure correct sending off.
On Tuesday evening or Wednesday we shall go on to Salzburg, thence to Vienna where we stay for a few days, and then to Berlin.

My dear Lohr, Enfin!a Arrived here Saturday night, after 6 days in Vienna and 1 in Prague 189 (where we met your old adorer Rudolf Meyer).
Vienna is an extremely beautiful town, with glorious boulevards (Ringstrasse), and the immense square between Rathhaus and—vis-à-vis—new Burgtheater, with Parliament to the right and University to the left, is unequalled in the world.
But Vienna is too big for its people, they are only beginning to learn the use of these boulevards; in about 10 years everything will be ten times finer, because 10 times more alive with people.
Altogether the Continent has undergone a complete revolution since I last saw it.
254 Everywhere life, activity, development, compared to which England appears stationary.
Of Berlin I have not seen much (not a square foot as yet of the Berlin I left in 1842, 255 as what I have seen so far, is all new addition) but it is indeed externally splendid, though, I fear, internally full of discomfort.
Bebel (where Louise and I are staying) has a very pretty and comfortable floor, but Libraryb where we spent last evening lives in a set of apartments so awfully arranged by the builder that it horrified me.
Here in Berlin they have invented the ‘Berlin er Zimmer’, a room with hardly a trace of a window, and that is where the Berliners a At last! - b jocular name for W.
Liebknecht given to him by Marx’s daughters public to any other.
The piece was rath er good and the acting far superior to what I had expected.
The Kleinburgereid of old has disappeared from the German stage, both in the acting and in the character of the pieces.
I will send you a short review of the latter.
In Vienna I had to appear twice before the ‘party’.
257 I am quite enchanted with them.
As lively and as sanguine as the French, but slightly more solid.
The women especially are charming and enthusiastic; they work very hard, thanks, to a very great extent, to Louise.
Adler has done wonders; the tact, the constant vigilance and activity, with which he holds the party together (not an easy thing with such lively people as the Viennese), are beyond praise, and if you consider moreover the difficulties of his private position— a wife ill with nervous ailments, thr ee children and interminable pecuniary difficulties arising therefrom—it is almost inconceivable how he can keep his head above water.
And these Austri ans—a mixture of all races, Celtic, Teutonic, Slavonic—are far less manageable than our North Germans.

You may have seen in the papers how I was drawn out of my reserve— first at Zurich, then at Vienna 257 and finally at Berlin.
262 I fought as hard as I could but it was no use, they must have me out.
Well it will be the last time, I have informed them I will not go there again except under a written engagement that I shall be allowed to travel as a private individual.
Anyhow they everywhere received me more than sp lendidly, far more so than I did, or had a right to, expect.
a Heinrich Heine - b Karl Marx sails.
They are a mixed race—Germans grafted upon a Celtic (Noric) 263 stock and getting strongly mixed with a Slavonic element—thus combining the three chief European races in their blood.
Their temper is very much like the French—more lively and sanguine than the less mixed Germans, and more capable of initiative by impulse.
Unless Paris minds its p s and q’s, Vienna may give the signal of the next revolution.
I like the people very much, and the Viennese women remind me very much of the French working women of 40 years ago; of course they are oversangui ne of success just like the French, but I think they are a deal clearer headed than those Parisians who fell in love with Boulanger—must close—company arriving.

In our compartment there were two shabby looking johnnies who turned out to be something of a nuisance; luckily one of them, an Englishman, was completely drunk by ten o’clock, after which they spent the rest of the day in the corridor.
In Hanover we had a meal consisting of soup and meat during the course of which we were joined by good old Kugelmann and his daughter 1, who is far nicer than he is.
He again treated me to a whole catalogue of medical precepts for the governance of my life, but also to a little basket containing meat sandwiches, apples and half a bottle of wine.
The sight of it sent us into transports—red wine! But alas, it was so-called ‘red port’, a sweetish concoction which we bestowed upon the ticket collector in return for his kindness.
Soon after this there arose a lively debate between the ticket collector and some of the passengers on the question of whether those bound for the Hook of Holland ought not to change at Löhne and travel via Rheine-Salzbergen.
We stuck firmly to Oberhausen, since Louise’s ticket did not leave us any other alternative.
At Minden, however, the train was already half an hour late and, since we had only 17 minutes at Oberhausen in which to make the connection, there was every prospect that we should miss it.
It was here that the time-table August had given me in the morning really came in handy.
We took the old Cologne-Minden railway a Franziska Kugelmann before those who had travelle d via Löhne-Rheine-Salzbergen.
Aside from a little of Kugelmann’s fare, Louise had taken only one bowl of soup at Arnheim and another at Rotterdam, whereas I had subsisted on Kugelmann’s fare and beer.
It was blowing quite nicely when we left.
I soon turned in and was quite pleasantly rock ed to sleep, but didn’t suspect there was anything amiss until I woke up in br oad daylight after 8 hours, when we should long since have been in Harwich! I got up—I had the cabin all to myself—no one on board was stirring.
I went up on deck to find it completely empty—everywhere wet decks and signs of its having been a rough night.
At last a young German came along and confided to me that we had been through a frightful storm.
Soon after, a few damsels appeared, and then Louise; the poor thing had been closeted in a small cabin with five others and had heroically survived the worst, despite her hysterical and sea- sick entourage.
Eventually, however, wh en the big rollers were succeeded by a choppy sea, she too momentarily su ccumbed to the importunities of old Neptune.
We arrived two hours late in London—the Avelings were at the station— found everything in excellent order and attacked our work with the recklessness customary in those who have heroically weathered a slight storm.
Nothing much would seem to have happened here, and it is only by degrees that we shall be able to fi nd out about the little comings and goings of the local movement.

All went very well with him on the trip, he was always cheerful and in good spirits, always worried about missing our connections, and full of beans.
On Sunday I myself at once fell back into my former, housekeeping role.
But our guests treated me indulgently.
Please tell August that I have not yet been able to find out anything definite about the second English edition; 265 I wish to see the book myself and shall get someone to buy it for me, but Reeves certainly wouldn’t sell it to me direct.
I add my warmest thanks to those of the Ge neral.

As regards Bruno Bauer’s career up till 1843, his fortunes and opinions, you might find some information in Ruge’s Hallische, subsequently Deutsche Jahrbücher; likewise in Bruno’s own writings.
Also, in regard to the years 1844-46, in his works and his Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung.
After 1843 both Marx and I completely lost touch with the Bauers who didn’t come to London until some time toward s the end of the 50s— Edgar for a prolonged stay, Bruno for a visit, at which time Marx saw them again.
However, so far as I know, Bruno never had anything to do with either the materialist view of history or scientific socialism, but if he ever had, this could only be discovered from Bruno’s la ter writings, those of the ‘50s and ‘60s.
It could hardly be denied that Marx’s views exerted a certain amount of influence upon Bruno’s subsequent works on early Christianity, but on the whole Bruno’s conception of historical causation remained primarily idealistic.
It is my opinion that no one could successfully write a book about Bruno without spending a long time in Berlin where all the material has accumulated.

10th.
I am afraid I cannot be of any use to you in your dispute with your family.
Even were your legal right to the money a good deal clearer to me than it is, I could only say that you, as a poor man, would hardly have the ghost of a chance, in English law courts, against wealthy people who moreover could fight you with your own money.
But supposing you had the money to fight, my advice would still be: keep it rather than waste it on law.
As to a lawyer such as you descri be and who would be willing to under- take your lawsuit, you will not be ast onished if I tell you I do not know such a one.

267 But that set the tone for the entire trip and completely put the lid on my intention of travelling purely as a private individual.
I stayed another fortnight in Switzerland, after which Bebel and I travelled via Munich and Salzburg to Vienna.
There the whole business of placing myself on display began all over again.
First I had to attend a beano at which, however, there was room for only about 600, and the others also wanted to see me; so on the last evening there was another mass meeting at which I had to say a word or two.
257 Thence via Prague to Berlin where, having protested vehemently against a mass meeting they had planned, I got away with a beano at which 3,000 or 4,000 people gathered.
262 The chaps meant all this very kindly, but it isn’t my cup of tea and I’m glad that it is over; next time I shall demand a written agreement to the effect that I shall not have to display myself before the public but shall be travelling as a private individual on private business.
I was, and still am, astounded at the magni ficence of the reception I was given, but I would sooner leave such things to members of parliament and public speakers; for them it’s all part of the job, but has little to do with my kind of work.
But in other respects, after 17 years of absence, 254 I found Germany completely revolutionised—industry enormously advanced as compared with before, agriculture—large- and small-scale— very much improved, a Hermann Engels senior — b willy-nilly But alongside the Germans of Germany we should not forget the Austrians.
By and large, they are not as advanced as these Germans, but they are more vivacious, more French, more easily carried away into performing great deeds, but also into perpetrating blunders.
Seen individually, I prefer the average Austrian to the average German, the av erage Viennese working man to his fellow in Berlin and, so far as the women are concerned, I infinitely prefer the Viennese working woman; she possesses a naïve spontaneity beside which the studied precocity of her Berlin counterpart appears insufferable.
If messieurs les Français don’t look out and make haste to resume their erstwhile tradition of revolutionary initiative, then it might happen that the Austrians will take the wind out of their sails and seize on the first opportunity to get things going.
Incidentally, Berlin and Vienna, together with Paris, are now the most beautiful cities in the world, London and New York being filthy holes by comparison, especially London which has seemed quite strange to us since our return.
In November messieurs les Français will have to show what they are ca- pable of.
268 Twelve Marxists and four Blanquists, 20 five Allemanists 21 and two Broussists, 30 along with a few Independents and some twenty-four socialistes radicaux86 à la Millerand in the Chamber constitute a goodish lump of leaven and should produce a nice state of fermentation provided they stick together.
But will they? The 12 Marxists are, by and large, completely unknown quantities; Lafargue is missing, while Guesde, who I met De Leon and Sanial in Zurich.
Was not impressed.
[Postscript from Louise Kautsky] Dear Mr Sorge, May I pester you again by asking whether it would be possible for you to send me two copies of the Woman’s Journal, or do you think I should do better to order it direct on behalf of a woman friend of mine in Vienna? If so, what is the best way of paying the Americans and to whom do I address myself? But that’s not all.
Please could I have a three cent Columbus stamp, if this isn’t asking too much of you.

But what lies behind those façad es is better passed over in silence.
The poverty of working-class districts is, of course, universal, but what I found particularly overwhelming was the ‘Berlin living-room’,a a place unimaginable anywhere else in the world, a refuge of darkness and stale air as also of your Berlin philistine who feels perfectly at home there.
Golly! There was nothing of the kind in August’s apartment, which was the only one I liked, but in any of the others I’d go off my head.
However in writing this letter it was not my object to send you the above cri de cœur, but rather to congratulate you and the Viennese.
First, your Schwender speech 269 which shows once again how sure is your grasp of the difficult and complex conditions in Austria, and how firm a hold you keep on the clue in the labyrinth.
And at this particular juncture that is of the utmost importance.
In the second place I must especially congratulate you and the Austrians generally on the resounding victory won as a result of your agitation for suffrage, namely Taaffe’s Electoral Reform Bill.
270 And here I must enlarge somewhat.
Having taken a look at your country, people and government I have come to realise ever more clear ly that really outstanding victories are within our grasp there.
An industry that is growi ng rapidly but which, because of years of high protective tariffs, still largely continues to operate a See this volume, p.
187 and stagnation, punctuat ed only by the feuding over nationalities between various members of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie, and by the events arising out of the union with Hungary.
Above all this there hovers a governme nt whose absolutist proclivities are subject to few formal, and these for the most part only fictive, restraints; nor, in practice, does it encounter many obstacles.
For it is by its nature conservative and so, too, is your aristocrat, your bourgeois and your philistine bon vivant.
The peasant, howev er, in his rural isolation, cannot achieve any organised opposition.
What is wanted of the government is that it should live and let live, and this is something at which the Austrian government has always been adept.
Hence the fabrication—explicable also on other grounds—of laws and regulations that exist only on paper, hence, too, the extremes to which that process is taken, its elevation into a principle and the astonishing administrative sli ppiness which, I must say, exceeded anything I could have imagined.
Well then, in a stagnant political situation such as this, one in which the government, despite its extraordinarily advantageous position vis-à-vis the individual classes, is nevertheless perpetually getting into hot water: 1.
because those classes are split up in to umpteen nationalities and hence, contrary to all the rules of strategy, march united (against the workers) but fight divided (i.
e.
, against one another), 2.
because of a high financiers more rapid and the party is stronger, yet resistance is far more determined.
Add to that the fact that Austria, a great power in decline, still feels ill at ease in Europe, a feeling that has always been foreign to Prussia, a small power in the ascendant.
And, having joined the ranks of the ‘modern’ states in 1866, Austria also feels ashamed of internal weaknesses —which it need not have done when still an avowedly reactionary state.
Indeed, the less a country wants to be a genuinely modern state, the greater will be its desire to be regarded as such, and the more strongl y reaction rears its head in Prussia— where it is under far greater restraint th an in Austria—the more liberal will be the attitude adopted by Au stria out of malicious glee.
Now, the situation in Europe—I mean the internal situation of the in- dividual states—is approximating ever more closely to that of 1845.
The proletariat is increasingly coming to hold the same position as the bour- geoisie did then.
At that time it was Switzerland and Italy who set things off; Switzerland with her internal strife between democratic and Catholic cantons which came to a head in the Sonderbund War; 273 Italy with Pio Nono’s 274 liberal endeavours and the liberal-nationalist changes in Tuscany, the small duchies, Piedmont, Naples and Sicily.
The Sonderbund War and the bombardment of Palermo 275 were, as everyone knows, the immediate precursors of the February revolution of 1848 in Paris.
Today, when the crisis might come to a head only five or six years hence, Belgium would seem to be taking over the role of Switzerland, would like, à la Bismarck, to split the now undi vided urban Liberal vote and play off the workers against the bourgeoisie.
Not that we have any objection; the Liberal and other bourgeois parties will try and restrict enfranchisement still further, and you might thus find yourselves in the pleasant position of supporting the worthy Taaffe against his parliament.
At all events, it’s a bonus that is not to be sneezed at and, before I come back, you will doubtless be duly installed as a deputy in the Diet.
The Daily Chronicle ’is already talking of 20 safe seats for Labour.
With 20, or even less than 20, the Diet will be a very different kind of body from what it has been hitherto, and the gentlemen will be amazed at the life that this will inject in to the ramshackle old place.
And if a few Czechs should ha ppen to get in alongside our German chaps, it will put something of a damper on the squabbling over nationalities, and enable Young Czechs and Old Czechs 277 and German Nationals to see each other in an altogether new light.
And here one might say that the entry of the first social-Democrats into the Diet, will mark the beginning of a new era in Austria.
And it is you people who have brought this about and, because of the dawning of this new era, we all of us rejoice that we shall have in the Diet a man with so incisive an intellect as yourself.
Warm regards from Louise and Your a 10 October 1893 IN BERLIN London, 12 October 1893 Dear August, We are sending you Reeves’s edition of Woman.
265 In my view the legal position (upon which the whole thing turns when you’re dealing with a chap like Reeves) is as follows: 1.
So far as the translator is concerned, international copyright provides protection for three years from the publication of the original, but only if during the first year the first part of a translation authorised by the author has actually appeared in print.
Accordingly you would have absolutely no claim unless Walther’sa translation had appeared within one year of the publication of a new German edition containing substantial alterations and additions not contained in the earlier one; this was hardly the case.
2.
There remains Mrs Adams Walthe r’s claim.
Whether she has any depends on whether, upon th e publication of the first English edition, she reserved the Copyright or whether she expressly or tacitly assigned it to the publishers, the Modern Press.
This should be ascertained.
If she did not expressly reserve it then, legislation over here being what it is, it is ten a Adams Walther SALE (assigning their stock, etc.
, to a fictitious or genuine creditor).
Yesterday we got two splendid bits of news.
First, the beginning of the end of the pit strike.
After the lock-out of the workers, engineered by the big colliery owners on 28 July: 1.
in order to raise prices and curtail production, 2.
so that ruinous contracts, carelessly entered into, for a year’s supply of coal to gasworks and other municipal undertakings could be broken with impunity because, in all such contracts, strikes provide indemnity against breach of contract, 3.
to depress wages and 4.
to ruin the small mining companies and buy them up at knock-down prices—this is coming increasingly to be the permanent motive behind all big LOCK -OUTS —well then, after the said lock-out had been going on for over two months and public opinion among the middle classes, who had been hit by the coal shortage, had also begun to turn—against the mine owners, things came to a head.
During the first week of October the agreement expired whereby the mine owners had undertaken, on pain of a £1,000 fine, to re- open their pits, but only if wages were reduced by a full 25 per cent (of the former wage plus the 40 per cent increase gained after 1889, i.
e.
at the 1889 wage plus 15 per cent), and on condition of the strike’s being called off by the miners’ committee.
A number of the smaller collieries immediately defected and resumed work at the pre-]uly wage (i.
e.
at the 1889 wage, plus the 40 per cent increase).
The mayors of the larger towns in the Yorkshire and Midlands mining districts then have much stomach left for a ‘general strike’.
(Have just got yours and Julie’s letter.
) The second piece of news was about th e new Austrian Electoral Reform Bill.
270 It is a resounding victory for our people and I hastened to congratulate Victor upon it.
a The Daily News thinks that the number of voters in Vienna will rise from 80,000 to 350,000, while the Chronicle estimates the number for Austria as a whole at three million—these estimates come, of course, from Viennese sources.
At all events it’s a bonus that is not to be sneezed at.
The bourgeois in Vienna are already thinking in terms of twenty Social Democrat deputies.
It’s more than probable that Taaffe is counting on his Bill being changed for the worse by Parliament, but it’s a long shot and our chaps will see that he doesn’t get away with it.
What a delicious quirk of history if it should so turn out that our chaps have to protect the Prime Minister against his Parliament and against his own secret self! The main thing is that the ball has at last started rolling and in Austria our movement is powerful enough to prevent its being brought to a halt.
And Taaffe cannot very well suppress demonstrations in support of his Bill.
From my general impression of Austria, I should say that that country will give us much cause for rejoicing in the immediate future.
What with a See previous letter.
government to be Conservative and, wh en it ceases to be Conservative, it simply becomes unpredictable, if only by reason of the fact that the party groupings of which it has to take acc ount are likewise unpredictable.
And again, the Austrian government is that of a great power which, though in decline, is nevertheless still a great power and, as compared with Prussia, a small power in the ascendant, is still capable of remarkable initiatives at such times as conservatism, sheer clinging to the status quo, ceases to be possible.
That is my explanation for Mr Taaffe’s ‘leap in the dark’.
Another fact to be considered is that the growth of the proletarian movement in all countries is about to precipitate a crisis and that in conse- quence any successes one country may achieve will react powerfully upon all the others.
The suffrage movement won its first victory in Belgium 276 and now Austria is about to follow suit.
At the outset this will ensure the survival of universal suffrage, but also encourage us to make further demands—in Germany no less than in France and Italy.
The way was paved for the February Revolutiona by Switzerland’s internal struggles and the constitutional upheavals in Italy.
Again, the Sonderbund War 273 and the bombardment of Messinab by the Neapolitans 275 (Feb.
1848) were the immediate signal for the outbreak of revolution in Paris.
Maybe the crisis will not be upon us for some five or si x years yet, but I should say that the a of 1848 in France - b a slip of the pen in the original; it should read Palermo Having been told in Berne that one of them but not both at once would be admitted, he should have realised that the best policy would be to give precedence to Julius, as an invalid and, banking on this, to return six months later, when they could hardly refuse him admittance, at least for any length of time.
But this his impatience would not brook.
The best of it is that he now sometimes avers he would prefer to stay here and that it’s Gina who wants to go to Switzerland.
His dream is, as it always will be, to go back to Berlin.
He really imagines this to be possible and is always consulting lawyers about it.
Remains to be seen! If Schlüter has any sense he will do himself and his wi fe the kindness of starting divorce proceedings.
A su it of this kind against an absent wife for deliberate desertion has few disadvantages for either party, and after all he too must wish for complete freedom.
This is not, of course, to say that he hasn’t in any case been accustomed to enjoying that freedom whenever op- portunity arose.
It is always satisfactor y, by the way, to hear that a woman one knows is plucking up the courage to make herself independent.
The decision to part from her Hermann for good may have cost her many a mental struggle and she may thus at one time have given the impression of being by nature irresolute.
What an expenditure of energy bourgeois marriage demands—first until one has got to that stage, then for so long as the nonsense lasts and then until one is finally done with it.
a fine specimen - b Aaron Bernstein Moscow, 1946 117 ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 35 AT LE PERREUX London, 13 October 1893 My dear Lafargue, Is the Paris letter in today’s Vorwärts from you? This is why I am asking.
When I was in Berlin, 189 Liebknecht said he was arranging to take you on as correspondent for Vorwärts, but that the money had still to be voted by the Party Committee; in the meantime he asked me to tell you that it was a matter of regular work, of letters to be se nt at stated intervals, once a week or a fortnight, for example, something which so far he had not been able to get from his French correspondents.
I promised I would write to you about it as soon as he let me know that the matter had been clinched between you two.
I used the opportunity to reproach him for setting such store by any German party and the French Socialists in general.
And, to this end, you must be represented on Vorwärts, so that the Paris correspondence should be, at least to some extent, in your hands.
Of course the decision does not rest solely with the editorial board.
The Executive Committee has something to say.
And I am convinced that you will find support there, if it is needed.
It goes without saying that I shall do my utmost to ensure the continuation of a close alliance between the German party and your party in France (which will not commit you to taking their money, that can always go to the Blanquists, if you don’t want any more of it, 278 as you say; they will be delighted to take it).
So let me know how far you have got with Liebknecht concerning your appointment as regular Vorwärts correspondent; and without delay, fo r, if there are difficulties, I must be able to take steps before the Cologne Congress on the 22nd of the month.
279 Going by Le Socialiste, I counted on our having twelve deputies.
It is true that, knowing no more than half of them even by name, I had my doubts about their reliability.
But, according to your letter, you do not seem to know so far as half of them are concerned whether they are our people or not.
Very unfortunate.

Taaffe proposes an electoral law 270 which is tantamount to universal suffrage at least in towns and industrial districts—so says Adler.
Taaffe’s policy is to break the power of the German Liberal Party (representing the German and Jewish bourgeoisie) and probably, too, to let as many Socialists replace Liberal Bourgeoi s as may be necessary to drive the other parties to a closer union and thus to give to him a working majority.
The Lower House in Austria is composed of 85 representatives of the large landed proprietors, 21 of the Chamber of Commerce (these 106 are not affected by the new bill), 97 of the towns and 150 of the country districts (both of these will be elected according to the new bill).

PETERSBURG London, 17 October 1893 My dear Sir, When I received your letter of July 26th announcing your return home, I was on the point myself of going abroad for two months and am only just returned.
189 This is the reason of my long silence.
Many thanks for the copies of the Outlinef three of which I have for- a Outlines of Our Post-Ref orm Economy (1893).

] forgets that the United States are modern, bourgeois, from the very origin; that they were founded by petits bourge ois and peasants who ran away from European feudalism in order to establish a purely bourgeois society.
Whereas in Russia, we have a groundwork of a primitive communistic character, a pre-civilisation Gentilgesellsehaft,d crumbling to ruins, it is true, but still serving as the groundwork, the material upon which the capitalistic revolution (for it is a real social revolution) acts and operates.
In America, Geldwirthschaff has been fully established for more than a century, in Russia, Naturalwirtschaft was all but exclusively the rule .
Therefore it stands to reason that the change, in Russia, must be far more violent, far more incisive, and accompanied by immensely greater su fferings than it can be in America.
But for all that it still seems to me that you take a gloomier view of the case than the facts justify.

That higher form being, wherever it is historically possible, the necessary consequence of the capitalistic form of production and of the social dualistic antagonism created by it, it could not be developed directly out of the agrarian commune, unless in imitation of an example already in existe nce somewhere else.
Had the West of Europe been ripe, 1860-70, for such a transformation, had that transformation then been taken in hand in England, France etc.
, then the Russians would have been called upon to show what could have been made out of their Commune, which was then more or less intact.
But the West remained stagnant, no such transformation was attempted, and capitalism was more and more rapidly developed.
And as Russia had no choice but this: either to develop the Commune into a form of Production, from which it was separated by a number of historical stages, and for which not even in the West the conditions were then ripe—evidently an impossible task—or else to develop into Capitalism, what remained to her but the latter chance? As to the Commune, it is only possible so long as the differences of wealth among its members are but trifling.
As soon as these differences become great, as soon as some of its members become the debt-slaves of the richer members, it can no longer live.

211 that they ‘plan’ to re-issue the Anti-Dühring and that all they require of me is to append a few brief remarks to the new edition.
What I myself might perhaps ‘plan’ no one bothered to ask.
Now you will recall that during our trip 189 we agreed to give the Anti- Dühring to Dietz and, in lieu thereof, the shorter, more popular stuff to the Vorwärts.
I shall therefore provisionally acquaint the gentlemen in Berlin of that fact, lest they should delude themselves further.
I am sending this straight to Cologne, as I understand from Louise th at you will be going from there to Stuttgart and will thus be able to discuss the matter with Dietz.
The following are my terms for an edition of a size he can determine himself but of which he must also notify me: 1.
A fee of 15% of the retail price, i.
e.
15 Pfg.
per mark.
That is what we get here in England for translations of my stuff.
Since the book does not, after all, lend itself to bulk sales except in a limited degree, he can fix the price accordingly.
2.
The fee to be paid to Dr Victor Adler of Vienna.
282 3.
Dietz to undertake not to reduce the price either of the whole or of part without my written consent.
This is to prevent the book from being used, as has happened before, to help shift certain slow-moving stock.
That is all.
As you know, Liebknecht (on that Sunday in Grunewald) tackled me with a view to my reminding Lafargue a bout regular work as a correspondent.
This I promised to do as soon as he let me know that the Executive had approved Lafargue’s fee.
A report of the Paris Marxist Congress 283 from a Paris correspondent then appeared in the Vorwärts.

I asked Mrs.
Adams Walther about her arrangements with Foulger.
She knew nothing definite, but will make i nquiries from the friend who saw to the matter and will let me know the result.
From what she was able to say, it seems highly probable that the copyright has been tacitly assigned to Foulger, and in that case absolutely no action whatever can be taken against Reeves other than by inserting an announcement in the papers to the effect that the said text has long been out of date.
265 I intended to send you the 20 marks I borrowed on the last day but have not got round to going into town and collecting German notes.
You shall have it next time.
Should there be a further amount owing to you, as is quite possible, perhaps you would remind me in your next.
Tussy has got Lassalle’s letters and will copy them out on her typewriter.

But what are you giving the heirs in the way of a fee? The handwriting is such that I still can’t tell how much it will be.

Yesterday this letter was laid aside yet again, as I had to take Shmuilov to the registry office and help him deal with the preliminary formalities, he being unfamiliar with English and I being unable to find anyone else.
It will be a month before the actual joining together in mat- rimony can take place.
In Austria the cause is doing splendidly.
The general disorientation of movement, it is we who determine it, now negatively, now positively.
We are now what the Liberals were before 1848, and our victories in the Belgian and Austrian elections have shown that the ferment we provide is strong enough to complete the process of fermenta tion now begun.
But the process will be neither smooth nor rapid until we have also won direct or indirect victories in Germany—conquests in the libertarian se nse, greater political power for the working man, the extension of his freedom of movement.
And that too will come.
If you make use of the passages from Miquel’s letters, don’t expend all your powder at one go.
Remember that hardly have the things come out than the effect is lost and cannot be repeat ed—unless, that is, we still have some ammunition in reserve.
There was a very real risk of a general strike in Austria and one cannot yet rule out the possibility of its being set in train for the benefit of Taaffe’s ministry and his electoral reforms, 270 which would certainly be the height of historical irony.
When the English miners were locked out,b it was clear how bemusing such a muddle-headed notion could be.
The basic idea is to force the hand of the bourgeoisie by means of a general shortage of coal.
This has its points if the workers take the offensive, i.
e.
do so when business is good.
When business is depressed, on the other hand, industrialists find themselves with excessive stocks and collieries Francis Joseph I — b See this volume, p.
204 collieries would unquestionably see to it that this was done and would receive military aid to that end.
Such , however, is not the case, and for the sake of a purely arbitrary act, the sole purpose of which would be to deposit the workers without shelter outside houses that would remain empty, the government will be unlikely to expose itself once again to the unpopularity it would attract as a result of a fus illade, as recently at Featherstone.
286 If it happens nevertheless, much blood will be spilt.
This is an ultimate sanction the workers won’t submit to.
The Avelings will be coming shortly , having just announced themselves for a meal.
This house is like a dovecote.

I was delighted with the Viennese; they are splendid fellows if sanguine, sanguine to a degree, no Frenchman could do better, and that means that they should not be spurred on but rather reined in, lest the fruits of long years of work be dissipated in a single day.
Last night Ede read out to me what you had written to him about an article on the strike as a political weapon.
I firmly advised him against writing the article.
290 To my mind the affair of the three-class electorate 291 has already earned him quite enough of a reputation as a man who has lost touch with the masses and who, from without, from his writing-desk , discourses in doctrinai re fashion on questions of immediate practical a Frederick Orridge Macmillan political general strike, the question w ill still be topical enough for the Neue Zeit.
But just now a public discussion of the general theoretical pros and cons of this weapon could only be grist to the mill of the FIREBRANDS in Vienna.
I know how difficult it is for Victor to counteract the magic power exerted on the Viennese masses by the catchword ‘general strike’ and how happy he will be if only he can put off the day of reckoning.
That being so we ought, in my opinion, to take the utmost care not to do or say anything that might encourage the impetuous elements.
The Viennese working men should wa it until the suffrage has given them the means to take stock of themselves and of their friends in the provinces; they will then be appraised of their strength and of how it compares with that of their opponents.
Incidentally, things might get to the stage when a general strike would be carried out under the aegis and more or less for the benefit of Electoral Reform Minister Taaffe.
That would be the height of irony.

Pareto has just been sent to me by Lafargue—extracts were made by Lafargue; the introduction was evi dently written by a bogus vulgar economist.
293 To come back to the general strike, you ought not to forget that nobody was more delighted than the Belgian leaders that the affair should have turned out so well.
They have had an anxious enough time and might have been forced to implement their threat; they themselves knew only too well how little they could accomplish.
And this in a primarily industrial country with a thoroughly shaky and ill-disciplined militia-style army.
But if, in such a country, there was nevertheless a chance of achieving something with this weapon, 276 what hope could there be in Austria where the peasant predominates, industry is sparse and relatively weak, the big towns are few and far between, the nationalities have b een set at odds with one another and the socialists make up less than ten per cent of the total population (of adult males, naturally)! So for heaven’s sake let us avoid taking any step that might tempt the working men, who are in any case impatient and thirsting for action, to stake their all on one card—a nd, what’s more, at a time when the government wants this and could use provocation to bring it about.
The Vorwärts will always remain the same old Vorwärts.

Herein the reason why they want it in German, and it is a very important one.
The two papers could publish the identical report on the same day, so that it would be an original article in each of them.
If publication is not simultaneous, if one of the two papers prints it a day later, it will be suspected of having taken the article from the previous day’s issue of the other, like so many other news items taken from that issue.
Now there might be someone in Hamburg who would translate you— don’t ask me how!—but in Berlin! There Liebknecht has established the custom of all translations being done by Mme Liebknecht or by one of his sons.
The manuscript goes to Charlottenburg and into Liebknecht ‘s house and God alone knows when the tran slation reaches the newspaper this job for you? Let us say 10 francs a letter for the translation and two copies, which would leave you 40 francs a letter, and would still provide an incentive to the translator.
What about Frankel? But perhaps he himself is a Vorwärts correspondent (I have no idea at all who provides the Paris letters which I see in it from time to time).
Anyway, think about it and try to arrange something.
You realise that our Berlin people are doing their utmost, try to facilitate the business for them.
And don’t forget that this will enable you to speak to 60,000-70,000 subscribers, i.
e.
, at least 250,000 readers without counting the readers of other papers who borrow their articles from these two organs, the most important ones that our Party in Germany has.
In any case, make a start with Vorwärts and leave the arrangements for the Echo and the translation for later.
But it would be wise not to lose time over it.
And further: Bebel as well as Liebknecht insist upon a regular contribution which will give them the outstanding events and your reflections and reports on the general situation.
One letter a week, and on a fixed day, determined by yourself (I do not think they will lay down the day for you).

Dear Mrs Liebknecht, Thank you very much for your letter and kind good wishes for my 73rd birthday which I passed in the best of health and spirits.
The Avelings and Bernsteins spent the evening with us, and empty bottles bore testimony to our good humour and general sense of we ll-being.
If things go on like this there will, so far as I am concerned, be no reason why I should not repeat my visit to Berlin, 189 in which case we could again take coffee in the Zoological Gardens and comment upon the four-l egged and two-legged, winged and wingless, roaring and talking zoological specimens on display, whether in captivity or at large.
Poor Gizycki! He’s unable to walk as it is, and now they are also trying to prevent him from talking, and this, becau se he illicitly consorts with Social Democrats.
Prussia is indeed not only a civilised state, but also a state of illuminati! I am very sorry that y our Karl should have acqui red fibrositis while on His Majesty’s service but let us hope he will soon get over it.
At all events the best thing to do, once one finds oneself in those circumstances, is to carry out one’s duties properly.
I can readily imagine that messieurs les officiers will take care not to compromise themse lves in the eyes of your sons,a those two sappers being uncomfortably close to the portals of the a Karl and Theodor Liebknecht mother’s birthplace and I often used to go there as a child, but now everything has changed and it’s a smoky, industrial sort of hole, though quite tolerable to live in.
Well, goodbye now, and please give my warm regards to Liebknecht and your children.
We shall hold Liebknecht to his promise of coming here after the New Year.
Mrs Kautsky also sends you all her warmest regards.

XXIX, Moscow, 1946 Published in English for the first time a Walter Bronsart von Schellendorff - b Heinrich Heine, Himmelsbräute (from ‘Romanzero’) will recede as time goes on; it’ s an insidious complaint.
The repeal of the silver purchase law 187 has saved America from a serious financial crisis and will help to promot e an industrial recovery.
But I am not sure whether it might not have been better had there really been a crash.
The phrase ‘cheap money’ seems to be deeply engraved in the minds of your Western farmers.
In the first place, when they suppose that, if there be ample means of circulation in a country, the rate of interest must fall, they are confusing means of circulation with disposable money capital, a matter upon which considerable light will be shed in Volume II I.
a And, secondly, all debtors find it convenient to incur de bts in good currency and subsequently pay them off in depreciated currency.
Hence every indebted Prussian Junker clamours for bimetallism 299 that would rid him of his debts in disguised, Solonic fashion.
300 Had it been possible to postpone silver reform in the United States until there had been time for the consequences of this foolishness to redound on the farmers also, it would have dinned some sense into many a thick skull.
Tariff reform, 301 however slowly it may be put into operation, would already seem to have given rise to a kind of panic among the manufacturers of New England.
I have learnt—both from private sources and the newspapers—that large numbers of workers are being laid off.
But all this will die down the moment the Bill goes through and puts an end to the uncertainty.
I am convinced that, in all the larger branches of industry, America can boldly go into competition with England.
As regards the German Socialists in America, things are pretty dire.

a number of smaller groups, each speaking only its own lan- guage—Czechs, Poles, Italians, Scandina vians, etc.

To form a party of one’s own out of all these calls for exceptionally strong incentives.
Every now and again a powerful élan may suddenly make itself felt, but all the bourgeoisie has to do is to stick it out passively, whereupon the dissimilar working-class elements will disintegrate again.

Finally, the protective tariff system and the steady growth of the domestic market must have exposed the workers to a prosperity unlike anything that has been experienced fo r many years in Europe, (with the exception of Russia where, however, it is not the workers who reap the benefit but the middle classes).
A country like America, when really ripe for a socialist labour party, is certainly not going to be deterred by a handful of German socialist doctrinaires.

Dear Baron, First of all my warmest thanks for your good wishes on my 73rd birthday which has left me fit and well.
Either you misinterpreted my remarks about the ‘publisher’ or I expressed myself badly.
a It never occurred to me to lay the blame on Dietz or, indeed, any one individual, in as much as I was not sufficiently au fait with what had happened over there in regard to the Stepniak business 288 before this had come to my notice.
I merely adduced it as an awful example that ought not to be followed.
And in view of the position occupied by publishers in this country, there could be no doubt that the German publisher had gratuitously presented Sonnenschein (or so it must seem to him) with £25, which could not but give him, Sonnenschein, a somewhat indifferent idea of the business efficiency of German publishers.
Nor can a See this volume, pp.
223-24 for Parliament.
Victor writes to say that the general st rike in Austria is dead as a door nail; so a discussion of it would not be likely to do any harm.
a But at the same time we have had inquiries from the Austrian provinces as to what we in this country think of a general strike.
I still believe that electoral reform, at least in the form hatched up by Taaffe and Franz Joseph, is a foregone conclusion in Austria.
270 Even if the coalition ministry succeeds in tabling and gaining acceptance for a Bill for the extension of the parliamentary franchise without, as it must, foundering in consequence, or in consequence of something else in the meantime, the matter will by no means be settled.
In a country as artificially equilibrated as Austria, a stable balance, once destroye d, can be restored only with difficulty, maybe by force alone, and the government is only too well aware that even this will be effective only for a while and will leave the state weaker than it was before.
And the fact that Franz Joseph has given his blessing to this particular piece of electoral reform whic h he has, indeed, declared to be his very own work, rules out once and for all the possibility of Austria continuing as before.

He is improving vastly, shaking off his Germanisms and becoming actually French.
Some time ago I went over to Oxford for a day, to look at the place and also at poor old Rotef Wolffg—your earliest admirer, for he admired you before you were 2 years old in Brussels.
Poor devil, he is quite cracked again.
He had written so mething about Bucher in the Neue Zeit,h and since then whenever a Wolf or Wolff (and you know they are as plentiful as the Smiths and Jones’s) is alluded to, he imagines that this is meant for him, and so he makes it out that there is a complete conspiracy to pretend that he does not know Latin—and you know, not to know Latin is the awfullest crime a man can be guilty of in Oxford.
But is it not a melancholy irony of fate, that one of the most spirituel 1 of men should end his career in the belief that he is the Massmann, not of a Heine, but of an imaginary conspiracy of second and third rate German literati! Then he is 81 years old—so, apart from other considerations, hardly any hope of recovery from this fixed idea which nobody can root out of his mind.

If this heterogeneous lot of 54 had been kept in the front rank of the chambre for any length of time, it must, either have split up, or else the old Radical wing—Millerand and Co.

As it is, time w ill be given to the various components of the group to make closer acquaintan ce with each other, to consolidate the group, and to eliminate, if necessary, one after another those elements which really have joined the group only by mistake.
At all events, in the Dupuy— Casimir Périer campaign M illerand and Jaurès took the lead entirely, and that will never do in the long run, though I fu lly approve of Guesde and Vaillant having, so far, and under the present circumstances, kept in the background.

My dear Schorlemmer, If I have not written before now to thank you for your good wishes on my seventy-third birthday, you can blame it on Volume II I of Capital.
This must now be finished once and for all and consequently I have had to put the whole of my correspondence on one side without compunction or remorse.
I have now one section left to be done a nd shall be able to use the few days remaining before the festive season to catch up.
I only passed through Darmstadt 189—Mrs Kautsky, Bebel and wife, a Viennese doctor 1 resident over here and I were unable to ascertain the train in advance, which in any case only stopped for ten minutes or so, otherwise I should have telegraphed you.

Fo r I have no right whatever, legally speaking, to intervene and would not like Siebold to refer to or even so much as hint at this.
If, however, I go and ask him for information for which you have appealed to me, that is rather a different matter and puts me in an altogether different position.
Siebold is an absolutely sterling chap but by nature not over-energetic and in recent years he has been weakened by illness.
In which case a little bit of extra help can do no harm.

Dear Sorge, Your postcards of 29 November and 17 December received with a Antonio Labriola for some, for others, however, ve ry remote—of their programme.
Concentration is now the battle-cry in France.
If in the past this meant a concentration républicaine (i.
e.
the subordination of all Republicans to the right wing, the Opportunists 87), it now means a concentration socialiste and I only hope this does not mean the subordination of all Socialists to the Millerandists whose practical programme is assuredly more radical than socialist.
The first result of this alliance is th at our people have as good as lost the chance of acquiring a daily of their own.
Millerand’s Petite République Française already occupies that position, so it will be difficult to produce an organ to compete with it—finance is more difficult to obtain and the others would complain that it would mean splitting the party! The more so as the Petite République Française is crafty enough to open its columns to any socialist group.
The second is that in the group’s m eetings the Millerandists command an absolute majority (ca.
30 against 24 at the most—Marxists (12), Allemanists 21 (3-5), Broussists 30 (2) and Blanquists 20 (4-6)).
Nevertheless messieurs les Français, intoxicated once again by victory, are crowing away for the benefit of all and sundry and would like to resume their place at the forefront of the m ovement.
They have tabled a motion demanding that the standing army be changed into an army of a contributions are not paid - b Radical Socialists momentary success.
But it would really be better for us to wait and see.
Next, I have to tell you— but this is strictly between ourselves —that yesterday the first third of the ms.
of Volume II P was packed in strong oil- cloth (as was in its day that notorious forgery, the Cologne minute-book 315) and will shortly be sent to the printers.
The last two-thirds are still in need of the final—mostly technical—editing.
If all goes well the book will come out in September.
Now for something else.
Prof.
Labriolac of Rome, with whom I have corresponded for several years and whom I met in Zurich, 189 is giving a course of lectures at the university there on the genesis of Marxist theory.
He is a strict Marxist.
To this end he has procured all the necessary literature but has never managed to set eyes on the Holy Family, although he has advertised in the Leipzig Buchändlerblatd and elsewhere to the effect that he will pay ‘any price’ for it.
There was some prospect of his getting a copy on loan from Switzerland, but its ownere has suddenly vanished and is said to be travelling in Hungary.
He is now urging me to do whatever I can to procure him a copy for three or four weeks.
But I myself have only one and if that is lost it will be absolutely impossible for me to arrange for the inclusion of the new, later edition in the projected Collected Works.

As for the proposal to be made concerning a disarmament congress, that would be—like Vaillant’s motion also— a matter to be settled by a conference of delegates from the three parliaments: French, German and Italian.
One delegate from each nati on would be enough.
Any international action must have as a necessary premis e a previous agreement both as to the basis and as to the form.
It strikes me as inadmissible that one nationality should take the initiative publicly and then invite the others to fall in.
The French, themselves pretty punctilious at times on matters of etiquette, should for their part observe democratic consid erations.
I shall not call the Germans’ attention to this point, but I should not be surprised if this rather naïve invitation, to follow in the footsteps of the I am proposing an international agreement for the reduction—simultaneous and agreed jointly in advance—of the period of military service.
To meet the usual prejudices as far as possible, I am proposing for a start a period of two years’ enlistment, to be reduced as soon as possible to 18 months (two summers and the winter between), and then to one year and so on, until a class of young men have reached milita ry age who shall have been through that athletic and military instruction which shall have fitted them to bear arms without further training.
And then there would be a militia that would require no more than large-scale manoeuvres every 2 or 3 years to find its feet and to learn how to operate in large formations.
Now that the two-year period is already generally recognised one could demand 18 months at once, and reduction to 1 year in 2 or 3 years; during that time, the athletic and military training of young men between 15 and 18 could be set going, not forgetting that of boys between 10 and 15.
Vaillant’s Bill has great need for re vision by someone who knows what’s what in military affairs, it contains things written in haste on which we could not stand up to serious argument.

Kautsky’s article which you reprinted 321 will be of great help to your people.
But it’s indicative of the extent to which its author has lost touch with the living party movement.
A few months ago he showed an inconceivable want of tact in proposi ng to sling a purely academic discussion of the general strike in abstracto, and of its pros and cons generally, into the midst of a movement engaged in a life and death struggle against slogans advocating such a strike.

BORGIUS 329 IN BRESLAUa London, 25 January 1894 Dear Sir, Herewith the answers to your questions.
1.
By economic relations, considered by us to be the determinant upon which the history of society is based, we understand the manner in which men of a certain society produce the necessities of life, and exchange a Now Wroclaw (Torricelli, etc.
) owes its existence so lely to the need to regulate mountain streams in Italy in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
Only since the discovery of its technological uses have we known anything rational about electricity.
Unfortunately historiographers in Germany have got into the habit of writing about the sciences as though they had appeared out of the blue.
2.
We see economic conditions as that which, in the final analysis, determines historical development.
Bu t the human race is itself an economic factor.
Here, however, there are two points which should not be overlooked: a) Political, juridical, philosophical, religious, literary, artistic, etc.
, development is based on economic deve lopment.
But each of these also reacts upon the others and upon the economic basis.
This is not to say that the economic situation is the cause and that it alone is active while everything else is mere passive effect, but rather that there is reciprocal action based, in the final analysis, on economic necessity which invariably prevails.
The state, for instance, exerts its influence through protective tariffs, free trade, good or bad fiscal systems, and even your German philistine’s mortal weariness and impotence, consequent upon Germany’s impoverished economic condition between 1648 and 1830, and expressing itself first in Pietism and then in sentimentality and cringing servility a the force of inertia chance is again ultimately economic.
This brings us to the question of what are known as great men.
The fact that such and such a man, and he alone, should arise at a particular time in any given country, is, of course, purely fortuitous.
But if we eliminate him, a replacement will be called for and such a replacement will be found— tant bien que mal,a but found he will ultimately be.
That Napoleon, this particular Corsican, was the military dictator rendered necessary by a French Republic bled white by her own wars, was fortuitous; but that, in the absence of a Napoleon, someone else would have taken his place is proved by the fact that the moment someone becomes necessary—Caesar, Augustus, Cromwell, etc.
—he invariably turns up.
If it was Marx who discovered the materialist view of history, the work of Thierry, Mignett Guizot and every English historiographer prior to 1850 goes to show that efforts were being made in that direction, while the discovery of the same view by Morgan shows that the time was ripe for it and that it was bound to be discovered.
The same thing applies to all fortuitous and seemingly fortuitous events in history.
The further removed is the s phere we happen to be investigating from the economic sphere and the closer to the purely abstract, ideological sphere, the more likely shall we be to find evidence of the fortuitous in its development, and the more irregular will be the curve a for better or for worse the introduction, and again in the final section of the Feuerbach.
d Please do not take every word I have said above for gospel, but rather consider them in their general context; I am sorry not to have had the time to write to you in such careful detail as I should have had to do for publication.

already been there once before and denounced Reuss as a spy, whereupon they had said they would get rid of him).
But now all of a sudden the story was that the proprietor of the paper wished to keep Reuss on and so there was nothing they could do about it.
But if Reuss nevertheless asserts that he gave notice himself on 9.

immediately afterwards, it shows that, as a result of what Aveling had to ld them, they treat ed him in such a manner as to force him to give notice—the fact remains that he was made to go.
However you cannot publicly ventilate any of these matters because you would risk a public denial by the Chronicle people, since etiquette in this country strictly precludes publication of a newspaper’s internal affairs and the chaps can thus tell any lies they choose and do so with complete impunity.
If I were you I should drop the matter altogether since it is no longer of any importance whatever.
The very most you could say would be that the Erfurt Conference took place in October 1891, immediately after which the information about Reuss was sent to London and that, as early as 9 November Reuss had, by his own admissi on, found it necessary to give notice—and let the reader draw his own conclusions.
Should you venture one step further, the Chronicle will state that, so far as it is concerned, the thing simply is not true, and neither it nor any other London paper will print a line of rectification from you.
Such is the etiquette of the press over here.

In this country the official politicia ns, both Liberal and Conservative, are in a state of complete disarray.
The Liberals can maintain their position only by making fresh political and social concessions to the workers, for which, however, they lack the courage.
Thus , they are trying to do so with an election cry against the house of lords instead of proposing payment of members, payment of election expenses by the government, and second ballot.
I.
e.
instead of offering the workers more power vis-à-vis the Commons and the lords, all they want is to give the Commons more power vis-à-vis the lords, and that is something the workers are no longer prepared to swallow.
But in any case there will be a general election here this summer and, unless the Liberals really take their courage in both hands and make genuine concessions to the workers, they will suffer defeat and go to pieces; at present they are held together only by Gladstone who might kick the bucket any day.
Then there will be a mi ddle-class democratic party with pro- Labour tendencies, and what is left of the Liberals will go over to Chamberlain.
And all this has come about simply as a result of pressure from a working class that is still disunited and only partially conscious.
If, in due course, it attains full consciousness, things will take an altogether different turn.

My dear Lafargue, I have just read Jaurès’ and Guesde’s speeches on the corn tariffs.
I must say Jaurès’ speech is astounding, and it seems to me regrettable that he was allowed to put forward his amendment in the name of the Party.
342 I don’t wish to speak of his proposal that the State should hold the price of corn at a minimum of 25 francs, which is out and out protectionism, and purely to the advantage of the big landowners into the bargain, since the small ones have no corn to sell, their produce not even sufficing for their own consumption.
Guesde certainly said that, but after Léon Say, whereas we should have been the first to proclaim it loudly, instead of fol- socialism ! Further, Jaurès fancies he has made an altogether new and unheard-of proposal.
But the petty-bourgeois Socialists in the canton of Zurich got in first; for years past they have been asking for state monopoly in the corn trade; their state, I may say, is a great deal more democratic than the French Republic, it can even treat itself to a chief of police who is a petty-bourgeois Socialist (Mr Vogelsanger) and knows nothing of omnipotent chief commissioners; and, besides, it is so small that it can afford many absurdities which mean nothing there, whereas a great nation cannot go in for such puerilities with impunity.
Guesde’s speech naturally suffered by having to support, at least for the sake of appearances, some of Jaurès’ proposals.
Fortunately his audience drew him into the field of general principles; that saved us; he was able to limit himself to touching lightly on Jaurès’ motion.
Speaking for myself, I should have preferred to see Guesde make his formal contributions in- dependently of Jaurès and as the m outhpiece of our group.
However, he did what he could.
All this is the upshot of the alliance with the ex-Radicals whom we are forced to endure.
a In the first place, why did Jaurès make promises to the radical voters which he knew he could not keep? A radical custom, 86 but in no wise socialist and one that we should do well not to adopt.
a See this volume, pp.
249, 262 of the proletariat.
You have the advantage of us in that it is already in being; we, for our part, shall have to waste 24 hours creating it.
But a republic, like any other form of government, is determ ined by what composes it; so long as it is the form of bourgeois rule, it is quite as hostile to us as any monarchy whatsoever (save in the, forms of that hostility).
Hence it is a gratuitous illusion to treat it as an essentially socialist form; to entrust it, whilst it is dominated by the bourgeoisie, with socialist tasks.
We can wring concessions from it, but never look to it to carry out our job.
Even if we were able to control it by a minority so strong that it could become a majority from one day to the next.
However, what’s done can’t be undone .
There will be other opportunities when our people will be able to come to the fore and proclaim their own tendencies, by means of Bills.
So you were surprised by Louise’s marriage? It has been brewing for some months.
Freyberger has left Vienna and given up a brilliant university career because they forbade him to enlighten the work ers, in his lectures, on the social causes of their ills.
So he came here, and he has found very good openings in the hospitals here.
Once that was settled, there was no further reason for delaying the wedding.
While waiting for his expectations to materialise he came to join his wife he re, you can see that it is an entirely matriarchal marriage, the husband is his wife’s boarder!

At the same time they want to abolish the house of lords but don’t lift a finger to produce a Lower House with the courage and ability to do this.
The Tories for their part are making mistake after mistake.
For two years they have been turning Parliament into a complete farce on the pretext of smashing HOME RULE; 171 with the Liberals, who took this lying down, they have played, and continue to play, Old Harry, as Randy Churchill demonstrated last night, 346 although, with elections in the offing, this is a risky business and might seriously shake the peace-loving [?]b British philistine’s faith in the Conservatives.
Furthermore, Salisbury attempted to make the PARISH COUNCILS BILL 163 an occasion for playing a dirty trick on his Liberal Unionist allies, 206 Devonshire and Chamberlain, and exploiting them for purely TORY ends, so that the said alliance is no longer as steadfast as heretofore.
In short, things are getting into a frightful tangle, and at the moment it is difficult to guess what the outcome will be.

c Auntie Motteler has just been here in company with Gertrud Liebknecht.
Apparently the latter wants to move in temporarily with the former.
What Liebknecht intends to do about her (s he says he wants her to go back) remains a secret—doubtless also to himself.
His eldest daughter, Mrs Geiser, is living in the worst possible circumstances and his wife and Gertrud are at daggers drawn.
I don’t in fact believe he has actually insisted that she return.
Have you seen the novel Helena by old Mother Kautsky in the Vorwärts? She has peopled her stage with a crowd of living party members, including Motteler and his wife.
It is a poor imitation of the popular novels of Gregor Samarowd (Spy Meding).
I shall be interested to see whether it is passed over in silence and am somewhat surprised that the Vorwärts should have taken it.
The paper’s feuilleton is censored by Mother Natalie Liebknecht.

To this the Liberals have calmly submitted, while the philistines, who have been turning Conservative in drove s, have rejoiced, since it was done on the pretext of removing the treasonable, anti-Empire HOME RULE BILL 171 HOME RULE Government.
Now, however, that serious domestic legislation is on the agenda, they are continuing to play the same game, and that might be rather too much of a good thing for your peace-loving philistine.
So things remain very uncertain and the new elec tions will at all events produce some surprising results.
Whatever happens, Labour will be strengthened and the Liberals will be compelled to make further concessions to the working man.
In Austria, Belgium and Holland elector al reform has also been the order of the day.
Before long there will be no European parliament without labour representatives.
In Austria the cause is progressing very well.
Adler is leading the movement with quite outstanding address and the Party Conference on Sunday 323 will also help.
Once the tariff business 301 has to some extent been sorted out on your side of the Atlantic and the duty on raw materials been abolished, the crisis will probably recede and the superiority of Am erican industry over that of Europe will undoubtedly make itself fe lt.
Only then will matters take a serious turn here in England, but then they will go with a bang.

IN MADRID [Draft] [London, 26 March, 1894] My dear friend Iglesias! I duly received your letter dated 24 N ovember, and I begin my reply by stating that this letter will be the last, if you persist in addressing me as ‘usted’.
Indeed, I have reason to feel offended by the fact that you refuse to address me in the manner customary among old members of the International and comrades-in-arms, the form of address which Anselmo Lorenzo, and many other comrades, old and younga accorded me as far back as 1872.
So.
let us please address each other as ‘tu’! I shall continue in French: I have not written in Spanish for more than twenty years now, and it would take me all day to write a letter in Spanish.

As for the anarchists, they are perhaps on the verge of killing themselves.
This fever of violence, this volley of assassinations, senseless and, in the final analysis, paid for and incited by the police, cannot but open the eyes of the bourgeoisie to the nature of this propaganda of madmen and agents provocateurs.
353 Even the bourgeoisie will realise in the end that it is absurd to pay the police, and through the police the anarchists, to blow up the very bourgeois who pay them.
And if now we also risk suffering from the bourgeois reaction, we shall benefit in the long run because this time we shall succeed in proving to everyone that th ere is a world of difference between ourselves and the anarchists.
Over here the movement is progressing quite slowly.
There is certainly a strong tendency towards socialism among the working masses.
However, the historical conditions in England are such that this tendency in the masses produces, among the leaders, a host of different cross-currents which even fight against each other.
Here, as in France, there will onl y be unity when there are some socialists in parliame nt.
Today there are only two—which is one too many, or at least, too few.
In Italy the situation is becoming critical and revolutionary.
I am sending you the Critica Sociale with an article which I have written on the request of my friends from Milan.

’ Kanitz, 356 one of the most shining lights amongst those Prussian Junkers who are, according to Hermann Wagener, their theoretical champion, either Ochsen von Geburt oder Ochsen aus Prinzip.
c This motion, made in the interest of the landed aristocracy of Eastern Germany, is almost literally the proposition [made by] Jaurèsd which was to show the way to the socialist world how to use their parliamentary position in the interest of the working class and the peasantry.
The same Count Kanitz has, the other day, proclaimed a new way to pay old debts, for the benefit of the German Empire: sell all your gold coin and repl ace it by about 4 milliards silver coin, which will leave 2 milliards clear prof it (silver being bought at 28 pence the ounce and being turned into money at 60 pence an ounce) wherewith to wipe out the Imperial debt.
Now if I wanted to be malicious, I might ask M.
Jaurès whether, in return for Kanitz’s accepta nce of his corn motion, he would not accept Kanitz’s silver motion which l ooks equally socialistic, and which, from an economic standpoint, is not a b it more objectionable.
But I will be generous, even with Jaurès, and l eave him alone; our French comrades, however, I cannot refrain from observing, ought really to look a little closer into the proposals of their ex-radical allies,e before they accept them blindfolded.

XXIX, Moscow, 1946 Barmen you so very kindly sent me, and I should like to say how very grateful I am to the Social Democratic Club in Barmen and, in particular, to the compiler of the album, for this kind and for me both flattering and agreeable gift.
Indeed it was an unexpect ed pleasure to be able to see the enormous changes that have taken pl ace in Barmen during the twenty years that I have been away.
I feel completely lost.
Other than by the station and on one, the older, side of the Werther Bollwerk, I can no longer tell where I am from the pictures.
Even the view taken on the Neuenweg, which surely cannot be more than a few minutes walk from the Bruch, is utterly strange to me.
Only our old house remains unaltered.
Though it is cheering to see these signs of an upheaval that has changed the Barmen of my youth from a small philistine backwater into a large industrial town, what nevertheless pleases me most is the fact that people there have also experienced a significan t change for the better.
Had that not been the case, Barmen would even now be represented in the Reichstag by an out-and-out Conservative, some thoroughly sanctimonious ‘swell’, nor could there be any question of a Social Democratic Club in Barmen, while the last thing that would have occurred to Barmen’s working men would have been to honour me with an album.
Fortunately, however, the revolution in the appearance of the town is attended by a revolution in the minds of its working men and for us that is a guarantee of a far mightier and more comprehensive revolution in the world as presently constituted.

Things are little changed over here.
There is no chance of achieving any kind of unity amongst the labour leaders.
But the masses are nevertheless moving ahead, Slowly it is true, and only now striving to acquire consciousness, yet the process is unmistakeable.
It will be the same here as in France and, before that, in German y: Unification will be forced upon them as soon as a number of independent wo rking men (especially those who have been elected without the help of the Liberals) secure seats in Parliament.

Th ereupon the Tories will take the helm and carry out what the Liberals intended—not merely to promise—actually to do.
And in that case an independent Labour party is pretty well assured.
The Social Democratic Federation 44 over here and your German- American Socialists 367 share the distinction of being the only parties that have contrived to reduce Marx’s theory of development to a rigid orthodoxy which the working man is not expected to arrive at by virtue of his own class consciousness; rather it is to be promptly and without preparation rammed down his throat as an article of faith.
Hence they have both remained mere sects, having come, as Hegel puts it, from nothing by way of nothing to nothing.

that you have made and already sent to the printers a Russian translation of my works on Russia which recently appeared in Berlin , just as you did previous ly in the case of other writings by Marx and myself.
368 I must needs draw your attention to the fact that, in accordance with the Berne Convention 303 Introduction to Wage Labour and Capital by Marx (1891) as well as the above-mentioned works are my literary property and that translations of them into foreign languages may not be published in the countries of the Union without my permission.
Even though the matter of fees may play only a subordinate or no role at all in cases such as these, or where genuine party undertakings are c oncerned, I am nevertheless obliged to assert my rights in the interests of the cause, for otherwise it would mean my assuming joint responsibility for th e publication of translations by unqualified or otherwise incompetent persons.
And since I have already committed myself to a third party, I am under a twofold obligation.
So far as I am aware, it has hitherto been customary in th e party, even in the case of translations of works unprotected by the Berne Convention, to show consideration for the writer by applying to him for authorisation.

impatiently.
Here things are moving, albeit slowly and in zigzags.
Take, for example, Mawdsley, the leader of the Lancashire textile workers.
He is a Tory, a conservative in politics, and a pious believer in religion.
Three years ago, these people were furious over the 8 hours day, and now they themselves insist on it.
In a recent manifesto, Ma wdsley, who a year ago was a vehement opponent of any separate politics by the working class, declares that the textile workers should think about direct representation in parliament, and a workers’ newspaper in Manchester calculates that the textile workers in the county of Lancashire alone would control twelve seats in parliament.
You will see: it is the trade-unions that will enter parliament; it is not the class but the branch of industry which is asking to be represented.
But that is also a step forward.
First let us break the subordination of the workers to the two large bourgeois parties by having tex tile workers in parliament, as we already have miners.
When there are a dozen branches of industry represented, class consciousness will explode of its own accord.

My dear Mendelson, I have received a long letter from Geor gi Plekhanov which contains many things with regard to you and the Polish movement.
I intended to read it to you last Sunday, but I have learne d that Mme Mendelson was taken ill and that therefore you had to stay at home.
If this be convenient to you, I shall come to see you the day after tomorrow, Thursday, from 2 to 2.
30 in the afternoon, together with Mme Freyberger, who would like to see how Mme Mendelson is feeling.
Yours truly, F.
Engels Our compliments to Mme Mendelson, who, we hope, is doing better.
My dear Plekhanov, Yesterday, shortly after my letter to you had left, Bernstein and Kautsky arrived at my house.
That has inevitably changed my plans.
I thought that I ought—even without waiting for your express permission—to read them your letter, and put them both in a position to judge for themselves of the Krichevsky business.
The impression this created on them will, I believe, be everything you could have desired.
Indeed, however much one might wish to remain neutral in issues and disputes within the Russian emigre community, one cannot excuse the behaviour of Kric hevsky as regards the translation of the Soziales aus Russland 368 after learning about the translation undertaken by Vera Zasulich.
a As for the rest, these gentlemen knew Karl Kautsky had given his consent to the translation of his Erfurt Programmeb; however, he thought that it was to be printed in Russia, or at least, he had not the slightest idea that it would be published in Switzerland.
Ignatievc is, so Kautsky told me, the pseudonym of Helfond (or some name similar to that), who is in Stuttgart.
You probably know him.
However, as I do not have Kautsky’s authorisation to use this information, I would ask you to treat it as strictly confidential.
According to Kautsky and Bernstein, it would seem that Helfond is an honourable fellow who has fallen into Jogiches’ trap by accident ra ther than malicious intent.

Krichevsky, Weggisa You have my permission to sell off the copies already in print of your Russian edition of Wage Labour and Capital along with my introduction, and I note with satisfaction that y ou will refrain from publishing my other works.
368 Apart from that, I thank you for your letter of the 25th which I look upon as a most valuable contribution to the characterisation of certain trends amongst the Russian émigrés.
Any inclination I might have to discuss its contents is tempered by the consideration that you yourself probably do not expect to impress anybody with these time-worn catchphrases à la Nechayev, since you yourself are doubtless aware how ludicrous it is to seek to act the Social Democrat while behaving like an anarchist.
But when you say ‘that we could have had no inkling that you had already made over the translation rights to someone else’, you might really have spared yourself that downright falsehood.
You knew long before you wrote your letter of the 10th of May that V.

With many thanks I received the Russian ‘Origin’ etc.

The sheets were sent rather late, but it was the fault of the publisher who delayed them a long time.
It is very hard work reading the proofsheets of a book like this.
You will find in the sheet s sent the solution of the question how the different rates of surplus value are equalised into one and the same average rate of profits, the law of the tendency of that rate of profits constantly to fall, and the mode in which commercial capital participates in the distribution of surplus value.

Marx, Capital themselves the sole right to speak for you all in the Chamber, will boss things.
Today they have the ear of the H ouse where they silence our people, tomorrow they will have the ear of the nation.
It is always on the cards that the whole thing will not turn out too badly, and even well; but, in the meantime, you will go through some curious experiences, and I am glad for us all th at there is a solid combat corps in Germany whose actions will decide the battle.
This socialist mania which is emerging in your country may lead to a decisive struggle in which you will win the first victories; the revolutionary traditions of the country and of the capital, the character of your army, reorganised since 1870 on a far more popular basis—all this makes such an eventuality possible.
But to ensure victory, to destroy the foundations of capitalist society, you will need the active support of a much stronger, more numerous, more tried and more conscious socialist party than you have at your command.
It would mean the achievement of what we have foreseen and predicted for many years.
The French give the signal, open fire, and the Germans decide the battle.
In the meantime, we are nowhere near that and I am very curious to see how the confused enthusiasm su rrounding you will resolve itself.
Even Carl Hirsch noted in the Rheinische Zeitung that behind all this noise over Turpin 374 there are but bourse speculators.
It is only the English press that is forbidden to say this and consequently, it pretends to see in that an affair of high and low politics.
Here one is sure that behind in profile, has really impossible lines.

As far as money matters are concerned th ere is no need for you to worry; they are in good hands and, as things are now, Roscoe is also in control of this aspect so that ultimately one must content oneself with the particulars he supplies in respect of payments made for work such as revision, etc.
It is possible that Roscoe’s task has been made somewhat easier by his having dealt with Siebold direct instead of with myself as promised, but it won’t make much difference since I should in any case have had to refer him to Siebold and Klepsch in respect of all se ttlements and should, in the end, have had to make do with his assurances.
A vital factor here is that, with the rapid advances made in chemistry, any textbook becomes out of date within a year unless constantly revised and thus, where this sort of literature is concerned, only a living author can keep his end up vis-à-vis either publishers or readers.

ENGELS TO VICTOR ADLER IN VIENNA London, 17 July 1894 Dear Victor, I am glad that those few marks should have arrived so opportunely and trust you will use them to treat yourself to the rest and recuperation out in the country which are so absolutely essential to you.
You simply must go away; what you need more than anything else is to recover from the wear and tear of your time in prison.
349 You yourself say you feel done in and that, if truth be told, is not surprising, so the moment you are released, out into the country with you! This would also be the best way of ensuring your wife’s complete recovery.
The additional chapter (it is only the enlargement of an already extant one) in Anti-Dühring is by Marx, so the only work I had to do on it consisted in copying and editing.
382 About 36 sheets of Volume II P have been set up and there will probably be more than 50 all told.
Since it is wholly in Meissner’s interest to get the thing out by September, it will doubtless be ready by then.
I wish your daily paper well and am already looking forward to seeing it.
377 It is really essential to set the insufferable Vorwärts an example of of Capital etc.
In short, you are engaged in an offensive and one, which, to begin with at any rate, is assured of victory.
In France, Germany and Italy, on the other hand, our people are engaged in what is a by no means always promising defensive action and have to withstand the onslaught of a reaction constantly reinforced by the adherence of the most disparate parties.
It is proof that—in Germany, at least,—our people have really become a power in the land, while in France, a country riddled with revolution, it is proof that our people are at least looked upon as a power.
But none the less you are, at the moment, in a better position to fight—you are attacking, gaining ground step by step, and every fresh bit of ground you seize and occupy not only strengthens your position but brings you vast numbers of fresh reinforcements.
Your primitive constitutionalism is such that there are still at least a few positions for the workers to capture, and by lawful mean s at that, i.
e.
m eans whereby they themselves will be politically educated—positions which ought to have been captured by the bourgeoisie.
In our c ountry, too, there are still positions of this kind to be taken, but these we shall only get if the impulse comes from without, from a country where the amalgamation of the old forms— feudalism, bureaucracy and police—with more or less modern, civil institutions, has given such prepondera nce to the first as to produce a situation of impossible complexity.
And that is the happy state in which you find yourselves, not to mention the even hap- recoup your strength, you will be neglecting what is your foremost duty.
And how serious that duty is becomes all the more apparent when you reflect that the only rivals whom you might have as a vanguard are the French.
You wrote and told Louise that you would like me to report on the latter.
I have put it off until today becau se 1.
last week Tussy returned from the Glassworkers’ Congress in Paris and 2.
Bonnier came to see us the day before yesterday and I wanted to hear their side of the story first.
W ELL, SO far as I can see, the position is this: The last elections 208 brought some twenty-five ‘Socialists’—Marxists, Broussists, 30 Allemanists, 21 Blanquists 20 and Independents—into the Chamber.
At the same time they elim inated what had h itherto been the ‘Radical group’, also describing itself as républicains socialistes, 86 notably by excluding all its former leaders.
Thereupon some thirty members of that group, who had been re-elected, combin ed under the leadership of Millerand and Jaures and suggested that they and the ‘Socialists’, should join forces.
169 It was a very safe move on their part for not only were they more numerous then the old Socialists, they were also united whereas the latter were fragmented into umpteen groups.
In this way they once more formed in the Chamber a respectable group some fifty or sixty strong without having to offer the old Socialists anything more than a highly platonic socialist programme, the politically radical articles of which had already formed part of their earlier programme as had their general pro- one fell swoop we’ve got fifty-five if not sixty! La France reprend sa place à la tête du mouvement!c The thirty or thirty-five new Socialists have entered into a marriage of convenience with Socialism.
They would just as soon not have done so, but taking the plunge was the shrewdest thing for them to do.
Having realised that they would not, after all, be able to carry on without the workers, they have had to ally themselves with the latter for better or for worse.
But for no- one was that alliance an altogether voluntary affair at first, as it certainly still is not for many today.
Of its leading representatives, Millerand is the shrewdest and, I believe, the most sincere, but I fear that some of his bourgeois-legal prejudices are more deep-seated than he himself realises.
Politically he is the most capable of the whole bunch.
Jaurès is an acad emic and doctrinaire who enjoys the sound of his own voice and whose voice the Chamber enjoys listening to more than to that of Guesde or Vaillant because he is more closely akin to the gentlemen of the majority.
I believe it is his sincere intention to turn himself into a decent Socialist but, as you know, the zeal of such neophytes is in direct relation to their lack of practical knowledge which, in the case of Jaurès, is very great.
Which explains how it was that a the socialisation of the means of production - b France will once more resume her place at the head of the movement.
might involve them in a conflict over principles, in which case a split might become inevitable.
They must, I went on, prepare for this so that in the event the transition to a simple alliance c ould proceed smoothly and not surprise them into making blunders.
Above all, should the chaps in the joint group put forward anything they felt unable to endorse and they be outvoted, they should repudiate any obligation to take the floor in the Chamber in support of such measures, but rather reserve the right to justify their adverse opinion in their press even if, for the sake of unity, they had had to vote in favour of the said measures.
Well, we shall have to see if it does any good.
Thus, on the one hand there are the new Socialists who are imposing a certain unity on the most disparate groups of old Socialists.
On the other, our chaps abroad, who find it puzzling that a group of some sixty men should suddenly have appeared ‘out of thin air’ and that its chief spokesmen, Millerand and Jaurès, should not hitherto have been known to be Socialists; hence the very natural doubts as to the authenticity of the aforementioned sixty, particularly after the brilliant impression left behind in Zurich by the French delegates.
250 Beneath the surface, the intrigues and mu tual recriminations of the various sects continue unchecked.
In particular the Marxists complain about Vaillant who is constantly touring the provinces for propaganda a economic matters things and incapable of seeing beyond their own noses, become conscious of their own feelings and requirements unless virtually forced to do so.
In the meantime political intrigue of the bourge ois-parliamentary variety continues to flourish mightily amongst the ‘leader s’, and never a day goes by without one’s hearing of some startling instance of this.
Ludwig is today sitting his examination for admission as M EMBER , (not merely L ICENCIATE ) OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS .
The thing goes on for a fortnight.
Soon after it is over we shall, with any luck, be able to go to the seaside—this year I shall be prevented from leaving England by domestic business.

whatever.
The millennium is reserved only for the martyrs and at best for such Christians as happen to be still living when it comes about, and to that extent, for the latter, it is of this world, whereas for the martyrs, who are only then resurrected fro m the dead, it is of the next.
So it’s the old story: You P AYS YOUR MONEY AND YOU TAKES YOUR CHOICE .
TO my mind what decides the issue is the f act that it is impossible unless one has a concept of immortality and a belief in reward and punishment in the next world.
Even less of this world is the New Jerusalem which is to come after the millennium and the Last Judgement.
But the so-called Pauline Epistles also have it that those believers still living at Christ’s second coming are to be ‘changed’, i.
e.
transformed and magnified from mortals into immortals.
That the millennium was here depicted in earthly colours goes without saying.
Even Revelation cannot rest content with such heavenly delights as sitting with a bare bottom on a damp cloud, twanging a harp with more or less gory hands and singing hymns to all eternity.

Thanks to you for the article of Jaurès in the Revue Socialiste;a it seems awfully shallow as far as I can see, but the man looks after all as if he was learning a bit, so we will not give up all hopes.
The Petite République is indeed awful reading—the disc ursive matter as well as the soi-disantb reports of facts, and you will not be astonished to learn that I do no longer long for it, unless it given real news, real reports, or articles from Jaurès (whose evolution I should like to follow) and Millerand.

The German Socialist law 15 kept me from Germany thirteen years, let us hope th is new law will not last long enough to prevent me from coming to Fr ance once more in my life.
Paul is not quite so enthusiastic about the situation in in France as ce cher Bonnier who considers the whole de bate—result and all—an unmitigated triumph for French Socialism; but s till his way of looking at the subject seems to me rather couleur de rose.
The main advantage I consider indeed to be the irrefutable proof that our part y is the only real and serious opposition party in France as well as in Germ any; and that the French Radicals 86 are no more serious in their pretended oppositi on than the German Richters & Co.
From that, as Paul says, a real union of all Socialist elements must grow; and the persecution now initiated will hasten it; and if this unification, under the auspices of Jaurès, Millerand & Co, and their lot,d means a lowering of the standard of the official expression of the party, un abaissement de niveau intellectuel et politique,e this comes from the previous indulging in revolutionary phraseology, as Paul also sees very clearly, and is but the necessary consequence of it.

In Turin he was a preacher or missionary of the English sect of Baptists, and showed me the letter from his eccles iastical superior in which he was removed from this post because of his socialism.
He will need assistance si nce, even if he serious ly looked for work, he does not speak a word of English.
As in other countries we have had some curious experiences with ex-ec- clesiastics of Christian, Jewish and other religions.
I and my other friends here would be obliged to you if you c ould give us some information on this man, who claims to know you.
Has he indeed been banished from Italy? Has he indeed been obliged to leave Paris to escape pursuit? Has he indeed played a role, and if so, what, in the events in Sicily and in the socialist movement in Italy in general? IN VIENNA London, 4 August 1894 Dear Victor, The encl.

These little schemes might well result in the Continentals saying: Neither of the two congresses is the one you ought to convoke and, since you don’t want to convoke the latter, we’ll simply go somewhere else and leave you to settle your squabbles between you.
It is inconceivably stupid of the Social Democratic Federation to have passed at the same time the resolution in regard to the Independent Labour Party 114 candidates, whether Socialists or not.
It’s the old story: either you are a Socialist, in which case you belong to the Social Democratic Federation or else you are unwilling to join the Social Democratic Federation, in which case you are no Socialist.
But what s eems to have entirely escaped their minds is the fact that these two resolutions, set side by side, would be bound to make the Continentals feel disinclined to have anything to do with the Social Democratic Federation’s congress.
All this, incidentally, has left me comparatively unmoved.
Between now and the congress all kinds of water will flow down the Thames and neither the quantity nor the quality of that water can possibly be predicated today.

39, Moscow, 1966 201 ENGELS TO FILIPPO TURATI IN MILAN Eastbourne, 16 August 1894 4 Royal Parade My dear citizen Turati, I am infinitely grateful for the trouble you have taken concerning the point of being unsaleable.
Your law on suspects 401 goes further than ours of 1878, 15 and the one passed in France in 1894.
383 It entails administrative exile as in Russia.
I hope, however, that this is one of t hose instances which will illustrate the German proverb ‘ es wird nichts so heiss gegessen wie es gekocht wird.
’e What is certain is that, of all the countries of Europe, Italy is the one where all political ailments suffer acute inflammation: rebellion with the outright use of force on the one hand, and excessively violent reaction on the other.
However, where Bismarck failed, Cris pi will certainly not succeed: in the end persecution will strengthen socialism in Italy, and all that I desire is that this squall will pass without forcing you temporarily into e ither the hell of Eritrea or the purgatory of London.
Speaking of London, the Social Democratic Federation, 44 one of the five or six socialist sects here—it has a Marxist programme, but the tactics of an exclusive sect—has just held a congress at which two quite important resolutions were adopted.
The first is characteristic of this Federation: it was proposed that the Federation should support the candidates of the Independent Labour Party 114 in the coming parliamentary elections if these candidates proclaim themselves openly to be socialist—rejected a See this volume, p.
333 - b The bore of the first degree has ceased to pester our circle.
- c He went to Varés.
- d “together with my wife and my little Marx Guglielmo” - e the devil is not so black as he is painted - f See this volume, p.
337 before the general congress in London.
392 Note that the group which is calling on the socialist world to attend a special congress which has no mandate whatever, declared at the congress I have just referred to that it had 4,500 members; but according to the secretary,a last year they had 7,000 names on the membership list, so that they have lost almost as many as they have retained, and another member boasted that during the fourteen years that this organisation has existed, no less than a million members have joined and left (except for the 4,500 mentioned above).
An organisation possessing such an ability to attract (and repel), which rejects all socialist candidates save its own (note that the Independent Labour Party, in the provinces, exists in perfect harmony with the SDF!), and which also wishes to exclude the trade unions at a time when they (our largest and most promising terrain for propaganda) are probably going to declare themselves at Norwich 396 for the second time in favour of the socialisation of the means of production (adopted at Belfast in 1893) 402 and adopted again by the council of workers of London 197 in 1894—such an organisation is indeed well positioned to take the initiative on such a question.
The continental socialists, now unite d in all the countries, will have a Henry Mayers Hyndman and wishes to take advantage of them so that it can take control of the congress and turn it into a separate event.
As the resolution adopted by the SDF is official and has been published, one can discuss it in the press.
However, it would be better not to lend it too much importance, as it is clearly an attempt to see which way the wind is blowing, and will become important only if there then come steps to carry it through, a circular letter of invitation, etc.

Your cheque will arrive during the firs t days of next month as soon as I shall have had some payments.
I am very curious to see how they are going to administer the new law against suspects.
383 I am by no means sure that they will not use it against the Socialists as much as against the anarchists at a given moment.
But though a few individuals may suffer by it, this law will certainly do for you what the ‘78 law did for the Germans; 15 you will defeat it and you will emerge from the struggle infinitely stronger than you went into it.
Here the Social Democratic Federation, 44 which for a time seemed to try to adopt a reasonable and tolerable lin e of conduct, has suddenly fallen back on the Hyndmanniads of yore.
At the Congress which they held in London a fortnight or three weeks ago, 404 the Liverpool delegate moved that at the next general elections they should s upport the Independent Labour Party 114 candidates provided they publicly declared themselves Socialists.
This, against all the rules of English procedure, was turned down in favour of a motion adopted by 42 to 12, that the duty of every Socialist was to belong to an openly revolutionary socialist organisation, such as the Social Democratic Federation (and as the S.
D.
F.
claims th at apart from itself there is no other, this meant: belong to the S.

As for electoral tactics, this was delegated to a committee which will report to the Executive Committee.

Will they administer this slap in the face to the British trade unionists, who have made such progress since the New Unionism 405 has set them on the road towards socialism, who at Belfast in 1893 402 voted for the nationalisation of the means of production (adopted a few week s ago in the political programme of even the recalcitrant London Trades Council 197) and which, in a fortnight’s time, at Norwich 396 will be stating its position in relation to us once again? But do you know how the S.
D.

in its annual report and the speeches at a conference depicted the strength of that organisation which claims to change the Zurich resolutions 229 (for this is a palpable emendation which contradicts the Zurich resolution)? It has—4,500 members.

count this as one of the Party’s victories in France? Whatever the case, the two months of September and October will be interesting.
Towards the 5, the Trades Congress, at Norwich 396 (after the Spanish congress 390 next Sunday), then your congress at Nantes, 406 then the Germans at Frankfurt on 21 October.
418 The last two will be dealing with the question of peasants and farm workers.
Overall, the views of the two national groups are the same, only that you intransigent revolutionaries of the bygone days are now inclining a little more to wards opportunism than the Germans, who probably will not support any measure which might serve to maintain or conserve small property against the corrosive action of capitalism.
On the other hand, they will agree with you that it is not our task to accelerate or intensify this corrosive action, and that a most important thing is to organise small property-holders into agricultural associations to cultivate land in common and on a large scale.
I am curious to see which of the two congresses will show itself to be the mo re advanced in economic theory and propose the more effective practical measures.
Give my greetings to Laura and remind her that she owes me a letter.

I, 1924 Published in English for the first time a Bernstein’s wife and adopted children working men immigration passed at Norw ich; but such contradictions and inconsistencies one will have to put up with for some time yet ‘in this free country’.
The moment will come after a ll, when the masses, having attained a sufficient degree of consciousness, will break through the tangled web of the intrigues and sectarian squabbles of the ‘leaders’.
The war between China and Japan 409 seems to me instigated by the Russian government, who use Japan as their tool.
But whatever may be the proximate consequences of this war, it must lead to one thing: the total break-up of the whole traditional system in old China.
There, an old- fashioned system of agriculture and domestic industry combined has been artificially kept going by rigid exclusion of all disturbing elements.
That exclusion of everything foreign has been partially broken through by the wars with the English and French; this war with Asiatics, rivals living next door to the Chinese, must put a complete stop to it.
The Chinese, licked on land and on sea, will have to Europeanise themselves, open their ports generally to trade, establish railways and fac- tories, and thus completely smash up that old system which made it possible to feed so many millions.
There w ill be all of a sudden a constantly increasing surplus population, supersed ed peasants, who will flock to the coast to search for a living in foreign lands.
Where up to now thousands emigrated, millions will want to go then.
And then the Chinese Coolies will be everywhere, in Europe as well as America and Australia, and will try to reduce wages and the standard of living of our working men to the Chinese level.
And then the time will come for our European workmen.

Published in English for the first time Dokumente, Hannover, 1971 a Aveling Louise’s marriage our old home had become rather too cramped and, since the consequences of that marriage soon manifested themselves, we could no longer make do.
We therefore took a larger house which became available a little further down the road, close by the gates into Regent’s Park and, after a great bother, moved in four weeks ago—bother with house agents, solicitors, contractors, furniture salesmen, etc.
, and it’s not yet over, my books being still in great disarray.
Downstairs we have our communal living-rooms, on the first floor my study and bedroom, on the second Louise, her husband, the baby daughter, born on Tuesday the 6th of this month, and nursery maid, on the third floor the two housemaids, lumber-room and visitor’s room.
My study is at the front, has three windows and is so big that I can accommodate nearly all my books (eight cases full) in it and yet, despite its size, very nice and easy to heat.
In short, we are a lot better off.
In the circumstances Louise and her baby are very well, and everything went off swimmingly.
Today, you will get two fat parcels, 3 copies of the (Berlin) Sozialdemokrat, 3 of the Pest Volksstimme, the rest of the proceedings of the Party Conference in the Vorwärts 418 and a Critica Sociale containing a letter by me.

Consequently he might—through the defection of the Irish and Radical voters—very easily lose his parliamentary seat in the General Election of 1895 345 and this would be fortunate, for at the moment the man is the greatest stumbling-block of all.
He appears in Parliament only on demagogic occasions, so as to draw atte ntion to himself by spouting hot air about the UNEMPLOYED to no effect whatever, or else to address inanities to the Queena on the birth of some princeb which, in this country, is cheap and trivial to the utmost, etc.
Otherwise, and particularly in the provinces, there are some very good elements, both in the Social Democratic Federation and in the Independent Labor Party —eleme nts which, though scattered, have at least succeeded in frustrati ng every attempt made by the leaders to set the two organisations at each other’s throat s.
John Burns is something of a lone wolf politically; he is furiously attacked by both Hyndman and a Queen Victoria - b Edward Albert, Prince of York the ruin of the small peasant by direct intervention, a task that may safely be entrusted to capitalism, but also that it behoves us actually to protect the small peasant against taxation, usury and the big landowner.
But we cannot go along with this, firstly because it is stupid and secondly because it is impossible.
Next, Vollmar 418 goes to Frankfurt and actually proposes to bribe your peasant as such; nor is the peasant with whom he is concerned in Upper Bavaria, your small, debt-ridden Rhenish chap, but your middling if not big peasant who exploits his farmhands, male and female, and sells cattle and grain in quantity.
And that would not be feasible unless one were to abandon the whole principle of the thing.
We can only win over the Alpine peasants and the big peasants of Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein at the cost of betraying their ploughboys and day labourers, and in so doing we should lose politically more than we should gain.
The Frankfurt Party Conference failed to come to any decision on this question and that is a good thing, in as much as the matter w ill now be properly gone into; the people who attended it knew far too little about peasants, or rural conditions, which vary so greatly from province to province, to do anything more than form resolutions out of thin air.
But the matter will have to be settled sooner or later.

a More than any other world event, the d eath of the Russian Tsar is likely to bring about a change, either as a result of an internal movement or as a result of a financial crisis and the impossibility of obtaining money abroad.
I cannot suppose that the existing system will continue to subsist if it brings to the throne an idiot whose health, both physical and mental, has been shattered by onanism.
(This fact is notorious in all the faculties of medicine.

For then a liberal wind will blow through Europe—a wind which now can only be of benefit to us.

I have had many a discussion with Sam Moore as to the possi- bility of providing, in my will, in some way for our dear Jenny’s children.
Unfortunately, English law stands in the way.
It could only be done under almost impossible conditions, where the expense would more than eat up the funds to be taken care of.
I therefore had to give it up.
Instead, I have left each of you three- eighths of the residue of my estate after defraying legacies etc.
Of these, two -eighths are intended for yourselves, and the third eighth is meant to be held by each of you in trus t for Jenny’s children, to be used as you and the children’s guardian, Paul La fargue, may think best.
In this way you are freed from all responsibility with regard to English law and can act as your own moral sense and love for the children may dictate.
The money I owe to the children for shares of profits on Mohr’s writings are put down in my ledger, and will be paid by my Executors to the party who, according to English law, will be the children’s legal representative.

Am just reading Ledebour’s reply to you.
424 The chap’s trying to be too clever by half.
As though, two years ago, you could have foreseen what Vollmar would be like today.
And it really is a bit much to conclude, merely because the small peasant has been told there is no intention of forcibly evicting him, that the intention is to provide economic conditions such as will enable him to continue farming on his own account.
Obviously, as things are today, you would have worded this or that passage differently.
But nobody is proof against verbal hair-splitting and my article might suffer exactly the same fate.
I look forward to seeing how the polem ic initiated by Bebel is going to develop.
425 It was long overdue.
I simply have not got the time just now to go into the matter of the International’s attitude to the question of land ownership.
Besides, it has been a ticklish point so far as the Inte rnational is concerned.
Firstly because of the Proudhonists in France, Belgium, etc.
, and their enthusiasm for parcels of land, and secondly because of Bakunin’s hobby-horse, the abolition of inheritance, which tended to obscure the issue.
426 Needless to say, the Vorwärts has come down in favour of unity, i.
e.
of hushing things up.
Nothing can be done about this for the present.
But anyone who hushes things up can now only be of assistance to Vollmar and will have to bear the consequences.
The only correct thing for me to do is, I think, to intervene in an absolutely objective way and leave personalities completely out of it.
Otherwise it will again be said that I am a F.
Engels, ‘The Peasant Qu estion in France and Germany’ 220 ENGELS TO PAUL LAFARGUE 35 AT LE PERREUX London, 22 November 1894 My dear Lafargue, I have found your report in the Sozialdemokrat.
419 That was lucky, for it has allowed me to put the responsibility for quite a few things on a somewhat careless editorship and to conclude that, although I did not agree with what the Nantes resolution 406 said, I think I agree with what it tried to say.
At the same time I have tried to be as friendly as possible; but in view of the way this resolution is being abused in Germany, it is no good remaining silent about it.
The fact is you allowed yourself to lean a bit too much towards the opportunist tendency.
At Nantes you came near to sacrificing the future of the Party to a momentary triumph.
There is still time to call a halt: if my articlea can contribute towards this, I shall be happy.

But when Russia needs gold, she must naturally try to get it! Loria will be even more pleas ed when he reads the preface,b he is treated there as he deserves and without the least regard for ‘il primo economista dell’ Italia’.

The poor young man had to keep quiet and lie low for over eight months; he can’t stand it any longer, he blows up—and there you are! At a time when we are winning a quarter of Belgium, 412 when electoral reform in Austria is about to send our people into Parliament, when in Russia everything is in a state of uncertainty about the future—the young man gets it into his head to outdo Crispi and Casimir Périer! You can tell the effect this will have in Germany from the fact that at the Frankfurt Congress 418 the delegates, or at least many of them, called for a new repressive law as the best means for the Party to gain ground! a [P.

I cannot very well write anything that is to be published in a language which I do not understand.
Were I to do so as a favour to yourself, I could not refuse to oblige others, in which case it might happen that my words were ushered into the world in unintentionally, if not deliberately, garbled form, while I might not learn about it for years, if ever.
Then there is another reason—grateful though I am to you for your interesting exposé of the Armenian situation—namely, that I do not regard it as right or fair to try and express an opinion on matters of which I have not acquired a knowledge from personal study.
Particularly in this instance when the people concerned belong to an oppressed nationality unfortunate enough to be trapped between the Scylla of Turkish and the Charybdis of Russian despotism, a situation in which Russian Tsarism speculates on playing the role of liberator and the servile Russian press never fails to make the most of every word uttered in favour of Armenian liberation by turning it to the advantage of a Tsarism bent on conquest.
If, however, I am to tell you honestly what I think, it is this—that Armenia’s liberation from the Turks and Russians will become a possibility only on the day when Russian Tsarism is overthrown.

If in my letters you find any facts that may be useful to you in your reply, you are welcome to make use of them.

I am daily and weekly assailed by Russian friends to reply to Russian reviews and books in which the words of our authorb are not only misinterpreted but misquoted and where they say my interference would suffice to set the matter right.
I have constantly declin ed doing so, because I cannot, without giving up real and serious work, be dr agged into controversies going on in a faraway country, in a language which I do not yet read with as much ease as the better known western languages, and in a literature whereof at best I but see occasional fragments and where it is utterly impossible for me to follow the debate closely and in all its phases and passages.
There are people everywhere who, in order to defend a position once taken up by them, do not shrink from any distortion or unfair manoeuvre; and if this is the case with the writings of our author, I am afraid I should get no better treatment and be compelled, finally, to interfere in the debate, both for other people’s sake and my own.

Dear Liebknecht, I have written to Bebel, 25 suggesting that, in po litical debate, one should always consider things calmly and do nothing in haste or in the heat of the moment.

’ They claimed special rights for the Bavarians and dubbed their opponents in the party ‘Prussians’ and ‘Berliners’.
They demanded that the grant of supplies be approved, as also an agrarian policy which is actually further to the right than that of the petty bourgeoisie.
Instead of promptly putti ng a spoke in their wheels, as had always been done before, the Party Conference did not venture to pass a resolution.
So if that wasn’t the time for Bebel to speak of the penetration of the party by petty-bourgeois elements then I’m at a loss to know when he should have done.
And what did the Vorwärts do? Fasten upon the form of Bebel’s attack, say things weren’t so bad after all and place itself in such ‘diametrical opposition’ to him that only the—in the event inevitable—’misunder- standing’ of Bebel’s opponents forced you to declare that your diametrical opposition referred simply to the form taken by Bebel’s attack, but that, so far as its substance was concerned—the matter of supplies and the agrarian question—he had been right and you were on his side.
432 I should have thought that the mere fact of your having been forced to make this statement after the event would have proved to you that you had strayed much further to the right than Bebel could have strayed to the left.
And after all, the whole debate hinged solely upon the two points in which the action of the Bavarians culminated, namely, the opportunism a Karl Grillenberger act in a way hitherto unpr ecedented in the party, mu ch to the glee of the vulgar democrats on the Frankfurter Zeitung who recognise in Vollmar and the Bavarians men of their own stamp, while the latter rejoice and become ever more audacious, You say Vollmar is not a traitor.
Maybe.
Nor do I think he regards himself as such.
But what would you call a man who asks of a proletarian party that it should oblige the Upper Bavarian big and middle peasants, owners of anything between ten and thirty hectares, by perpetuating a state of affairs based on the exploitation of farm servants and day labourers? A proletarian party, expressly founded for the perpetuation of wage slavery! The man may be an anti-Semite, a bourgeois democrat, a Bavarian particularist and anything else you care to name, but a So cial Democrat? Come to that, in a growing workers’ party, the accretion of petty-bourgeois elements is inevitable, nor does it do any harm.
Any more than the accretion of ‘academics’,a failed students, etc.
A few years ago they still constituted a danger.
Now we are able to digest them.
But the process of digestion must be allowed to run its course.
And for this, hydrochloric acid is needed; if there is not enough of it (as Frankfurt went to show), we ought to be thankful to Bebel for giving us an extra dose, thereby enabling us properly to digest the non-proletarian elements.

Dear Madam, May I tender my warmest thanks for the delightful present you were so kind as to send me for my birthday? I value it all the more highly, not only for being your own handiwork, but also and above all for your having found leisure to do it at a time when you already had enough and more than enough to do for the little one that is on its way.
For during that self-same time I was again afforded an opportunity of seeing, here in my own house, what a multitude of cares and preoccupati ons the expectation of motherhood involves.
b I have all the more reason to pride myself in a present made for me at such a time.
I put it to use at once, on my birthday, when I took a short siesta.
One sleeps upon it as sweetly as the proverbial ‘quiet conscience’ upon a ‘good pillow’.
In fact I feel pre tty sure that it would be able to cope without dif- ficulty even with a pr etty uneasy conscience.

Between ourselves, my 75th year doesn’t hold out quite so much promise as previous ones.
True I am still nimble enough on my pins, besides having an appetite for work and a reasonable capacity for it, but nevertheless I find that stomach upsets and colds, which I could once afford to treat with supreme contempt, now demand the most respectful treatment.

Stiebeling, Das Werthgesetz und die Profit-Rate, New York, [1890] catch the big peasants of Upper Bavaria—men with 25-80 ACRES of land (10-30 hectares) and thus quite unable to manage without wage labour —but not their labourers.
Having no high hopes of the Frankfurt Party Conference 418 they organised, a week before the latter, a Bavarian Party Conference of their own in the course of which they constituted what amounted to a Sonderbund, 431 in as much as they agreed that at Frankfurt the Bavarian delegation should, on all questi ons relating to Bavaria, vote as a body and in accordance with the Bavari an resolutions previous ly settled upon.
So, having arrived there, they d eclared that they had had to grant the general estimates in Bavaria, there having been no other alternative and that it was, furthermore a purely Bavarian question in which no one else had any business to poke his nose.
In other words, if you resolve anything we Bavarians do not like, if you reject our ultimatum, then it will be your fault if there’s a split! Such was the claim, unprecedented in th e annals of the party, with which they confronted the other delegates who were utterly unprepared for it.
And to such extremes has the clamour for unity been taken in recent years that, having regard to the influx of as yet insufficiently trained elements during the same period, it is small wonder that this attitude, incompatible as it is with the party’s continued existence, should have got by without the peremptory rebuff it deserved, and that no resolution should have been taken on the question of supplies.
federalist, particularist complexion in him is forever coming to the surface.
Worse still, he cannot tolerate the fact that Bebel, who has long since out- grown him, refuses to submit to hi s guidance although he puts up willingly with his presence at his side.
Furthermore, so badly has he managed the central organ, the Vorwärts —mainly because of the jealousy with which he guards his LEADERSHIP , wanting to direct everything and in fact directing nothing, i.
e.
placing obstacles everywhere—that the paper, which could be the best in Berlin, serves only to provide the party with profits amounting to 50,000 marks but no political influen ce whatsoever.
Needless to say, Liebknecht is now intent on acting as mediator and pours scorn on Bebel, but in my view, it’s the latter who will turn out to be right.
In Berlin the Executive and the best of our chaps ar e already taking his side and I am convinced that, if he appeals to the part y at large, he will get a big majority.
Meanwhile we must wait and see.

Th e same day as I receive your card, one addresses the same request to me on behalf of Berlin students; I am obliged to send them the same refusal as I do to your friends.

Little Willie and ‘Mr von Kö ller, Whatever they do there’s worse to foller’ are a fine pair and as if cut out to get everything into a mess and us—out of it.
Bebel has emerged victorious.
In th e first place, after Bebel’s articles Vollmar broke off the controversy, 434 in the second, his appeal to the Executive was most resolutely rejected and, in the third, he appealed to the parliamentary group but the latter, having been declared incompetent by Bebel, admitted its incompetence, which means that the matter will come up before the next Party Conference, when Bebel can be certain of a majority of two-thirds or three-quarters.
It is the third campaign Vollmar ha s fought for a leading position in the party outside of Bavaria.
On the firs t occasion he demanded that we should actively support Caprivi and become government socialists.
437 On the second, that we should go in for state socialism and assist the present German Empire in its socialist experiments.
438 On both he got a flea in his ear.
And now he has got another.

439 I have written Liebknecht two letters about this,b from which he will have derived little pleasure.
The man is becoming ever more obstructive.
He still claims to have the best nerves in the party—no great shakes, to go by his rotten speech in the Reichs tag the day before yesterday.
440 Nor, it seems, has this gone unnoticed in government circles where an attempt is clearly being made to help him ont o his legs again by accusi ng him of lese -majestie, 436 allegedly committed a posteriori.
That affair proves, by the way, either that Williamc and von Köller are completely crazy or that they are deliberately trying to engineer a coup d’état.
Hohenlohe’s speech has demonstrat ed that he is an utterly gormless,d feeble-minded, weak-willed old gentle man, and nothing but Mr von Köllers man of straw.
Köller himself is a typical Junker—vain, forceful and narrow- minded, and is capable of presenting himself to Little Willie as the man who will put paid to ‘subversion’ and carry out to the very letter His Majesty’s intentions with regard to the restoration of the royal prerogative.
And William is capable of saying in reply: ‘You are a man after my own heart!’ If that’s how matters stand—and every day brings fresh indications that it is— then vogue la galere!e We’ll be in for a merry time.

Now this can only mean one of two things: Either you in your correspondence are so enmeshed in a web of postal and other kinds of intrigue that it is virtually impossible to get a letter to you, or your disinclination to answer letters is such that you would rather forego the money that has been offered you than write to Louise.
Either way we have got to know where we stand.
The chaps are pressing for a decision for, if you refuse the money, they will invest it elsewhere.
We have therefore been compelled to send this letter to Mrs Anna Pernerstorfer, with the request that she deliver it to you in person and to no one else.
We would now ask you— -for the very last time —if you would kindly let us know whether or not you wish to negotiate with us and or Louise regarding the money.

For that purpose I receive 3 German, 2 English, 1 Italian dailies and from January 1 the Vienna daily, 7 in all.
Of weeklies I receive 2 from Germany, 7 Austria, 1 France, 3 America (2 English, 1 German), 2 Italian, and 1 each in Polish, Bulgarian, Spanish and Bohemian, three of which in la nguages I am still gradually acquiring.
Besides that, calls of the most varied sorts of people (just now, a few min utes ago, Polak from Amsterdam sent me a German sculptor penniless and in want of employment) and an ever increasing crowd of correspon dents, more than at the time of the International! many of whom expect long explanations and all of them taking away time.
With all this and the 3rd volume, I have not, even during the proof-sheet-time, that is the whole of 1894, been able to read more than one book.
Now the next thing is the publication of Lassalle’s letters to Mohr.
284 Tussy has typed them, they are in my desk, but—thanks to the removal—I have not been able to touch them.
That means notes, references to facts long gone by as well as to my own old correspondence with Mohr— and a preface to be written diplomatically.
Then the heaps of arrears of my own.
First the complete rewriting of the Bauernkrieg 235 which has been out of sale for years, and has been promised as my first work after Vol.

That requires a considerable study; I hoped to do that along with the proof-sheets, But impossible.
Anyhow I shall have to look myself up how to do it.
Then—not to speak of other little jobs hanging over me—I want to write at least the chief chapters out of Mohr’s political life: 1842-1852, a of Capital have one or two intelligent men of th e younger generation broken in to read Mohr’s handwriting.
I thought of Kautsky and Bernstein.
Kautsky was then still in London (some 6 or 7 years ago).
I asked him and he assented; I said I would pay one hundred pounds for the complete ‘fair copy’ of what there is, and assist him where he could not deci pher.
He began.
Then he left London, took one Hefta with him, and for years I heard no more, He was too busy with the Neue Zeit, so I had Manuscript and copy returned, as far as the latter went—perhaps 1/8 to 1/6 of the whole.
b Bernstein too is not only very busy, but suffers from overwork, has not yet completely overcome his neurasthenia, and I hardly dare ask him.
I shall see whether Tussy will; if he volunteers, all well; if not I do not intend to run the risk of having it said that I brought on a relapse of his illne ss by overloading him with work.
That is my position: 74 years the which I am beginning to feel, and work enough for two men of 40.
Yes, if I could divide myself into the F.
E.
of 40 and the F.

of 34, which would just be 74, then we shoul d soon be all right.
But as it is, all I can do is to work on with what is before me and get through it as far and as well as I can.

Crispi is mortally wounded by Giolitti’s sensational move 445—the whole of Parliament as well as all the higher o fficials are compromised by it, and in simple-minded Italy they are still so Catholic, that is to say, pagan, that all this is done in broad daylight and there is no means of concealing the corruption, of which, on the contrary, they boast—until there is a crisis.
And then, Russia—the unknown, where only one thing is certain: that the present regime will not be able to stand a change of tsar, and there will be a crisis there too.
What you say about the effect pr oduced by the little scene in the Reichstag goes for England as well.

—I hardly imagine that E.
Bernstein will be able to send you a great deal; as it is, he seldom has much time to spare for articles for the Vorwärts and prefers to work for the Neue Zeit.
Lafargue has asked whether you could make use of him as a contributor.
I told him that in the first instance you would have to consider Frankel but that I was unaware of all the circumstances and would write.
b He—Lafargue—is a lively and interesting writer but his stuff, like the Gallus reports he sends to the Vorwärts, is all in French.
His wife does not write German either and speaks it only on fairly rare occasions.
No r is she as fluent as Tussy.
I don’t know whether it would be convenient for you to do the translating over there yourselves.
Lafargue would naturally have a fee in mind, since he has lost his deputy’s salary.
I couldn’t tell him anything about that either.
Things are getting complicated on the Continent.
In your country electoral reform is assured—and nowadays, when something like that gets under way, it is not so easy to stop—while Russia is seeing the beginning of the end of Tsarist omnipotence, for it is improbable that autocracy will survive this latest change of monarch; in Italy they are heading straight for a revolution that may cost the monarchy its head, and in the German Empire Little Williec seems intent on crossing the Halys and destroying a great empire.

Adler writes about Paul’s correspondence for the daily Arbeiter Zeitung: ‘was Lafargue anlangt so habe ich nichts gegen französische Korrespondenzen, ich werde viel übersetzen müssen.
Natürlich wird Frankel regelmässig schreiben—Lafargue ist ein Korrespondent wie ich es für den Vorwärts bin, selten, aber dann lang.

408-11 wishes which I sincerely reciprocate.
But now we had better get down to business straight away, as I am overwhelmed with correspondence, etc.
453 If I understood you aright, the collection in America was mainly to do with Marx’s articles in the Tribune.
I have two collections of these over here, of which one at any rate is incomplete and probably both, since the Tribune also published Marx’s articles as unsigned leaders.
A third collection could therefore only be of use to me for the purpose of completing the set and that was why I suggested at the time that it should be temporarily housed in the archives where I could always have access to it when necessary.
But you now speak of earlier things, i.
e.
stuff from the period up till 1851, and that, of course, is quite a differe nt matter and not what I had understood you to say in Berlin.
454 These things are in fact of the utmost value and it is only the lack of them that has prevented me from bringing out a complete edition of these lesser works as well as of the articles by Marx and myself that appeared between 1842 and 1852.
It has long been my wish to publish these things, once I am in some sort of a position to do so and if, therefore, you can place as many of them as po ssible at my disposal, you will be making your own contribution towards that end.
In which case I shall resume my search for a copy of the Rheinische Zeitung of 1842, chiefly with regard to Marx’s articles.
Please tell me again where the collection originated and, if you cannot at once get hold of the things themselves, kindly procure for me, if possible, a list of the books, periodicals, etc.
, contained therein, but excluding the Tribune articles.

In short, not a party but so many sects.
The leaders ar e nearly all of them pretty unreliable fellows, while the candidates for the supreme leadership, though thick on the ground, are by no means eminently fitted for the post.
At the same time we have the two big bourgeois parties who are standing by, purse in hand, to see whom they can buy.
Moreover, what is known as ‘democracy’ over here is much restricted by indirect barriers.
Periodicals are shockingly expensive, ditto candidatures for Parliament, ditto life as a Member of Parliament—if only on account of the vast correspondence this entails.
To revise the deplorably kept registers of electors also costs a great deal of money and hitherto none but the two official parties have been able to defray that cost.
Hence it is unlikely that anyone who does not support either of those parties will appear on the register.
People over here are far behind the Continent in all these matters and, what’s more, they are beginning to notice it; again, there is no second ballot, a relative majority or, as you Americans would say, PLURALITY , being enough.
It is a situation in which everything is organised on the basis of only two parties and, until a third party is strong enough to be a match for them, the most it will be able to do is turn the scales.
In the same way there is little likelihood of the Tr ades Unions over here bringing off something on the lines of the Berlin beer boycott 458—a court of arbitration such as was secured over ENGELS TO KARL KAUTSKY IN STUTTGART London, 3 January 1895 Dear Baron, Firstly, a very Happy New Year from one household to the other, and, secondly, my thanks for the amusing report of the MARE ’S NEST discovered by Liebknecht.

At the moment I am reading Gardiner’s Personal Government of Charlesa in which the parallels with present-day Germany are so close as to be almost absurd.
As, for instance, the arguments over immunity from the consequences of actions performed in Parliament.
Were Germany a Latin country, a revolutionary conflict would be inevitable, but as it is, you can’t be certain about nowt, as Jollymeiera used to say.
Meanwhile the business of the peasants has quietly fizzled out, though August’s attack was most meritorious nevertheless and made good much of which had been omitted at Frankfurt.
425 The worthy Bavarian socialists who favour reserved rights will be in no hurry to burn their fingers again.
Amongst the various small factions over here things are, for the moment, jogging along in the usual dilatory way.
Though their mutual squabbles are no longer so heated, the intrigues behind the scenes are being conducted with proportionately greater zeal.
The masses, on the other hand, who are being instinctively drawn towards socialism, are experiencing a growing urge for conscious and unified action.

actually make us the champions of the constitutional rights of the Reichstag! And it was precisely this new conflict that provided us with the opportunity of bringing the Berlin beer boycott to a victorious conclusion, 458 a victory which has made a great impression abroad and especially here in England, For despite their seventy years of publicly organised trade clubs and considerable freedom of association, the workers over here are very far from securing the kind of court of arbitration that was successfully fought for in Berlin.
In the words of one paper: ‘Kaiser William would do well to reflect on the fact that the men who have got the better of a beer barrel will also get the better of a sceptre.
’ And that was our doing.
In Germany there are now only two people whose speeches command general attention—the Kaiser William and August Bebel.
His last speech was brilliant, but it must be read in the or iginal transcript.
461 Though I am again in good health, I realise, of course, that 74 isn’t 47 and that I can no longer make so free with food, drink, etc.
Nor am I as hardy as in the past.
But I am nevertheless still perfectly robust for my age and trust I shall live to see this and that, especially if, as seems distinctly probable, the gentlemen in Berlin decide to engage in a slight tussle with the Constitution.

Dear Old Man, As you see, I reciprocate your congratulations on the completion of my 74th year (you were kind enough to make me a year younger (than I am) with a resounding Happy New Year.
Let us hope that, come the next one, we shall both of us still be hale and hearty; for I have a great desire just to take one peek into the new century, though by the first of January 1901 or thereabouts, I shall be a complete wreck, and then let happen what may.
I was not unduly disturbed about the row in the party.
463 It is much better that things of this kind should crop up from time to time and be properly thrashed out than that people should don their nightcaps.
For the very fact that the party has steadily and inexorably grown and expanded has meant that the new elements are more difficu lt to absorb than their predecessors.
The working men of the big cities, i.
e.
the most intelligent and wideawake, are already ours and what we are now getting are either the working men of the small towns and rural areas, or stude nts, salesmen, etc.
, or again, those struggling to keep their heads above water, counting on there being a split, while at the same time ensuring that there should not be the slightest risk of one.
Take, for instance, the present Subversion Bill 428 and Liebknecht’s elevation to the status of representative of the rights of the Reichstag and of the Imperial Constitution, 436 likewise the threatened coup d’état and infringement of the law by the powers that be.
Of course stupidities are committed on our side also, but to render it possible for opponents such as these to get the bette r of us, we should have to be of a stupidity so abysmal as to be without rival anywhere else in the world today.
Otherwise your idea of giving the younger generation a chance to take the helm in the party and thus get itself into a fix would not be at all bad; but I believe that they will acquire experi ence and common sense even without an experiment of that kind.
As you can see from my address, I have, as we used to say, moved a few doors along.
This house is much better and more convenient and is very close to the park entrance.
I hope that the ‘Heilig Geist’ wher e we downed a good few glasses in our time, is still flourishing.
465 I should like to cool off on some hot summer’s day in its Gothic vaults.
But who knows what may not happen? One should never say die.
Well, once again a Happy New Year and warm regards from Yours F.

Dear Friend, I have had your various letters of 6 Sep.

and the 1st of this month and have passed on your message to Aveling.
466 Many thanks for the trouble you have been to over the pr eface to the third volume of Capital.
It in quite a good thing that it should come out in the Rassegna 467 since it will enable people in Italy to see that abroad Loria’s spurious greatness is viewed in a very different light from what it is at home.
On the other hand I can understand that at present Turati should consider it better tactics not to attack the man as vehemently as I do.
a When we had the exceptional laws 15 to contend with in Germany, our tactics were different in many respects, and individual opponents whom we have since mercilessly attacked were temporarily spared for one reason or another.
In cases such as these I must rely to a very large extent on the judgement of men who, like Turati, are in the thick of the fray; those men may not always do what I, from my standpoint over here, would consider best or most important, but nevertheless they are doing something, are doing their duty to the best of their knowledge, and are prepared to take the consequences.
If the government didn’t find Turati and his Milan friends exceedingly objectionable, it would not have put them under domicilio coattob for three months or five.

Since your wifeb has a perfect command of Russian, might it not be worth your while to have a look at and, perhaps, make use of it? It really would be a capital joke if the Arbeiter-Zeitung were also to steal a march on the bourgeois press in this particular field.

His reports from Vienna before the advent of Windischgrätz showed an undue bias towards violent revolution which, at a time when reaction was everywhere gathering strength, was not unwelcome to us.

Dear Hermann, At long last! But I haven’t got the time to make excuses.
First of all, my thanks for your news which has put me pretty well au fait again.
I shall now repay the debt by telling you all manner of things in return.
To begin with, you will see above a change of address.
This came about as follows: About a year ago Mrs Kautsky, my fellow-lodger, became engaged to a compatriot of hers, Dr Freyberger, a young and extremely able Viennese physician who settled in this country two years ago.
Before long a desire manifested itself to clinch the engage ment with a marriage but, since I had no desire to put myself at the mercy of strangers in my old age, it was arranged that we should all three set up house together, and thus the need arose for a larger place.
In the m eantime the young couple had got married early in February while we were s till living at 122, but we soon found and took a very nice, large and exceptionally cheap house in a far better part of the same road.
We moved in at the beginning of October and, at a Ignaz Auer for two and a half years and live on the advance.
The last tenant, a doctor, used to pay £130, from which you will see how much the value of houses fluctuates here.
This rehousing business happened during the summer and, since I took the place on a seven year lease with the opti on to renew for another seven years, this and obtaining a guarantee for my advance have necessitated prolonged legal negotiations which have prevented me from going any distance away from London.
Hence I only spent five weeks or so at Eastbourne on the south coast.
393 It is one of the nicest seaside places I know and is, in fact, already becoming a seaside suburb of London for people who don’t have to come up to town more than a couple of times a week.
Please will you again convey my bela ted congratulations to Elsbetha on her engagement, and to Walterb on having, or so I hope, successfully passed his examinations, Actually, I still owe Walter a letter but must, alas, continue in his debt, thus also owing him, no less than yourself, an apology.
I trust he won’t take it amiss.
Well, now for the sherry.

LANDLORD , and I should be glad if, in the c ourse of this month, you could let me have, say, £40.
Finally, I have a pleasant piece of news to impart, namely that I have at last become an old man.
Last spring I had an attack of bronchitis which, though not at all severe, refused to budge for six weeks or more; and on top of that I suffered a great deal last y ear from stomach-ache, constipation, etc.
So in the end I had perforce to believe Freyberger when he said I must no longer indulge in my former Sparjitzen.
a And when the looking glass reflects an ever more abject image of encro aching baldness, I can no longer conceal from myself the realisation that there is very little in common between 74 and 4 7.
Eating and drinking have both been considerably curtailed and I also have to submit to all kinds of unwonted protective measures against catching cold.
Well, I shall have to put up with it, and at least it hasn’t cost me my sense of humour.
So that’s that, and my debt, I trust, is now repaid.

477 Things are going well.
If the year ‘95 finishes as it has begun we may see some strange happenings.
In Germany, young Williama has fallen into the hands of the ‘agrarians’ (the big aristocratic landowners of the Eastern provinces, the Junkern)b who want to make sure of their control over this young ninny and who can only do so by compromising William to the point of no return.
Thus they are hinting at a dissolution of the Reichstag, which will emerge from fresh elections more refractory than ever and then, his throne and his honour being at stake, th ere will be nothing for it but a coup d’ état to give William the means of obtaining new soldiers and ships, and the Junkers new import duties on agricultural produce and subsidies on the export of sugar, spirits, etc.
That seems to be these gentlemen’s idea; impossible to say how far it will materialise.
In the meantime, they are playing with fire—the War Ministerc openly inviting our people in the Reichstag to come out on to the st reets by jeering at them—they are absolutely determined to create an opportunity for firing on the people.
478 And in your country there are the scandals of bourgeois corruption which go beyond anything and are driving towards a crisis: certainly if the Ministry threatens to bring the majority to court unless it votes against Gérault- Richard, matters cannot go on much longer.

114 Sad but true.
A fortnight ago I received a letter fro m Vaillant enclosing some of his Bills.
480 I promised I would examine them critically as soon as I had the time.
c Meanwhile I told him 25 that Wroblewski, in Nice, has written asking me for money, that he has had an accident, broken his arm, has been in hospital and is in great distress; that I have given him as much help as I could but that it is beyond my means and that in my view the Communards and the socialist deputies owe it to their honour not to let him die of starvation.
He replied that they had tried to get up a public subscription for Wroblewski but that he, W.
, was against this and that there is nothing to be done.
Do you know anything about this? Wroblewski as a true Pole does not understand the handling of money, he spends it lavishly when he has it; perhaps he has done similar things in relation to Vaillant and others who would have been able to help him.
What he needs is a little regular pension, paid out once a month in small amounts.
But in my view it is a matter of the honour of French socialism which cannot claim credit for the Commune of 1871 if they allow the last general of the Commune to die of hunger.

Dear Sorge, Have received card of 6th and letters of 19th and 31st Dec.
Many thanks.
And may I again heartily reciprocate y our and your wife ’s good wishes for the New Year.
By way of a New Year’s greeting Stie beling sent me his grotesque riposte 475 together with the suggestion that I should get the Neue Zeit to print it!! I replied 25 to the effect that its columns were not at my disposal a These last three paragraphs are wr itten in the margin of this letter.

Karl Heinzen, for instance, not to mention religious and spiritualist superstition.
Thus you still have old Lassalleans amongst you, while a man like Sanial, who would now seem passé in France, is still able to play a role over there.
This may be attributed on the one hand to the fact that, over and above its concern for material production and the accumulation of wea lth, America is only now beginning to find time for untramelled intellectual work and the preliminary training this demands; on the other hand, it may also be attributed to the dual nature of America’s development, still engaged as it is on the one hand in the primary task of reclaiming the vast area of untamed country, while being already compelled on the other to co mpete for first place in industrial production.
Hence the UPS AND DOWNS of the movement, according to which point of view takes precedence in th e average person’s mind—that of the urban working man or that of the peasant engaged in reclamation.
In a couple of years’ time all this will change and then we shall witness a great step forward.
The evolution of the Anglo-Saxon RACE with its ancient Teutonic freedom happens to be quite exceptionally slow, pursuing as it does a zig-zag course (small zig-zags here in England, colossal ones on your side of the Atlantic) and tacking against the wind, but making headway none the less.

At the same time, however, these gentlemen, Köller & Co.
, despite their ostentatious catchwords, are so poorly endowed with courage that they are already prey to all manner of forebodi ngs, and it may well be asked whether they will not take fright when the moment for action comes.
And as for France! There, as in Italy, the bourgeoisie precipitated itself head first into corruption in a manner that would put America to shame.
For the past three years all efforts in both countries have been directed towards finding a bourgeois government—admitte dly not free from corruption—but whose immediate involvement in public scandal is nevertheless so slight that a parliament could support it without unduly violating the commonest decencies.
In Italy Crispi will hang on for a little while longer only because the Kingb and the Crown Princec are as deeply implicated in the banking scandals as he is himself.
d In France, our forty-five or fifty socialist deputies have just toppled their third Ministry on the count of actual corruption, and Casimir-Périer has gone tumbling after.

My dear Löhr, Your last letter has indeed startled me.
485 I have tried, not very success- fully, to recollect the terms used in my letter to you of December 29tha; still, in what I do remember there is not a word which ought to offend you.
And indeed, if there is anything in the tone of that letter which you think strange, it is there entirely against my will and intention.
It never could occur, nor has it ever occurred to me for a moment to a See this volume, pp.

In the meantime things have come to a crisis in your neighbourhood.
I intended to write at some length about that, but Bebel all at once asked me for historical materials as to the various and pretty frequent riots here in England which are settled without ever attempting to encumber the Statute Book with increased penal laws or exceptional legislation.
He is in the Committee on the Umsturzvorlage 428 and wants it for them, so I had to leave everything else alone and get it off by this day’s post before the usual Sunday delays in postal communication retard it.
Anyhow our 50 French Socialist memb ers are in luck.
In less than 18 months they have upset three ministries and one president.
484 That shows what a Socialist minority can do in a parliament which, like the French or English, is the really supreme power in the country.
A similar power our men in Germany can get by a revolution only; still, the break-up of the Centre party 71 would make them the arbiters of the house and give them the balance of power.
What a miserable retreat is that of Casimir’sa! After the brag with which he came in, to skedaddle at the first serious difficulty! 486 It looks as if our bourgeois heroes had individually degene rated quite as much as their class has done collectively.

Mr Faure may do what he likes, he cannot halt this process of forming into two opposing camps, nor the confusion wh ich is necessarily born of this interplay of opposing forces, attraction and repulsion, within the milieu of the bourgeois parties.
That is precise ly the milieu we need, and which the existence of a socialist group creates everywhere, however little power it may have in Parliament.
You will race ahead; it is the Party’s progress itself that will first subdue and then eliminat e the intestine and traditional quarrels.

And Jaurès, indeed, seems full of goodwill—if he develops rather slowly it is perhaps a good thing for him and for us.
Though frankly, in economic matters he needs further schooling.
His Bills for immediate reforms in the Petite République 489 article are not quite as wild as his Bill for a corn monopoly, 13 but they are calling on the bourgeois for sacrifices incompatible with the advance of capitalist industry, so that in their eyes they are tantamount to immediate expropriation; whereas, on the other a Gean Casimir-Périer - b See this volume, p.

So that, with the complete revolution in weapons since 1870 and, in consequence, of tactics, there is a total uncertainty about the outcome of a war where so many imponderables are involved and regarding which all the calculations made in advance are based on fictitious quantities.
In these circumstances we seem to be assured of peace and even the most frenzied bourgeois ch auvinists of the Déroulède type can keep calm: the Pr ussians have taken over responsibility in Alsace for maintaining and nourishing French patriotism.

I am sending you a report of the Norwich Trades Union Congress.
396 a William II Dear Sir, I still have to thank you for your ki ndness in sending me your critique of Barth ‘s book and your interesting article on Pestalozzi.
490 I would beg you to excuse the delay which was occasi oned by an excess of work, the latter being aggravated by my having moved house (please note the change of address).
I should say that you have let Mr Barth off rather lightly; he would, at any rate, have fared far worse at my hands.
However, in literary debate one has to get used to the fact that, lawyer-fashion, one’s opponent suppresses what doesn’t suit his book and introduces extran eous matter if he thinks this will enable him to pull the wool over his r eader’s eyes.
But in Mr Barth’s case this is done in a manner and to an extent that cannot but lead one to ask whether what we have here is simple ignorance and boneheadedness or deliberate, wilful distortion.
To take only his chapter on Marx—how does one explain the horrendous misinterpretations, nearly all of which are incomprehensible in a man who does, after all, claim to have read my Anti- Dühring and Feuerbacha which should have constitute d a perfectly adequate antidote? And what can one say about the absurd causal nexus attributed to me on p.

A series of brilliant ideas nearly all of which, however, suffer to a greater or lesser extent from inadequate development; 2.
A correspondingly narrow, philistine outl ook in stark contrast to that brilliance; 3.
A religious system of undoubtedly Saint-Simonian origin but stripped of all mysticism, hierarchically organised and utterly flat—with, at its head, a pope, no less.
Thus Huxley was able to say of Comtism 491 that it was Catholicism without Christianity.
c Now I am willing to bet that No.
3 supplies the key to the otherwise incomprehensible inconsistency of Nos 1 and 2; namely, that Comte derived all his brilliant ideas from Saint-Simon but he assembled them in a manner peculiar to himself and by so doing bowdlerised them.
By stripping them of the mysticism with which they were imbued, he simultaneously degraded them to a lower level, giving them a philistine slant in accordance with his own lights.
A great many of them can be easily traced back to their Saint- Simonian source and I feel sure that certain others would admit of the same treatment if only someone could be found who would seriously apply himself to the task.

So, where news from official circles is concerned, you will never be able to compete with the big bourgeois papers who not only monopolise the sources but can also organise news-gathering services on a footing similar to that of big industry.
It’s hard luck, your having to content yourselves during the first few weeks with the little provincial assemblie s, but the Diet will soon be meeting again and then you will have plenty of material, whereupon your personal intervention will agai n become necessary, The differences in the Ministry here are of no great account so far as their practical consequences are concerned.
The Liberal government contains as many shades of opinion as it has members.
Now that the big bourgeoisie together with Whig aristocrats 497 and the university ideologues have gone over to the Conservative camp (a process which began after 1848, gained impetus after the Reform Bill of 1867 498 and became very marked after the HOME RULE BILL 171).
Liberalism has been largely an omnium gatherum of all the sects and sectarian crotchets in this sect-ridden count ry.
And since each individual sect considers its own particular crotchet to be the one and only panacea, the result is constant strife.
But of greater moment than that strife is the certain knowledge that only cohesion vis-à-vis the outside world can keep them in power for a extraordinarily effective th at it enabled you to save yourselves the expense of another, quite unnecessary, edition.

No one in Paris can equal her knowledge of personalities and you would therefore be well-advised to file away for future reference even those articles for which you have no present use.
Over and over again she has seen all her Radical and Republican friends plunge into the mire of corruption and has thus, bourgeois though she is, acquired a remarkable sympathy for Socialists.
She has one unshakeable conviction, however, and that is that J.

For I myself do not possess one of my own and if I did I couldn’t let it out of my hands.
Now for another matter.
When the Vorwärts set up its bookselling side, Augusta wrote to say that I would be sent two copies of all your publications.

You would greatly oblige me by sending them to me, namely your reprint of the Subversion Debate in two parts’b and a couple of copies of the most recent edition of the Communist Manifesto.

You will have to speak to her about it first, a nd obtain her consent, and then the best would be for her to talk to me, and I will take care of the rest.
Or else she can talk to Louise Freyberger if she pref ers, and Louise will see to everything.
That is my suggestion, but if you think you have another idea on how to achieve your aim, tell me about it, and we can discuss it.

When the north-easter blows it is bitterly cold but when, like yesterday and today, there is little wind, it is glori ous.
Fortunately there is always enough wind to disperse the fog, the result being a marvellous blue sky.

ENGELS TO JULIUS MOTTELER 515 IN LONDON [London,] 23 February 1895 41 Regent’s Park Road, N.
W.
Dear Julius, One Theodor Barlen,a the bearer of a card from the Dortmund club, has called on me seeking assistance.
He is a deserter, having decamped from Spandau, and alleges that he was previously a very active party member in Hörde, Dortmund, etc.
I referred him to the Society.
62 He came back today to say that the Society refused to reco mmend him to me, since they did not know whether the papers he produced were his own.
As I should like to have some information on the man so as to know whether I ought not to send him packing once and for all, I would ask you to tell me whether this accords with the facts and, once his case has been investigated, what view they take of him at the Society.
516 Many regards to your wife and yourself from a Hermann Barlen in the ms.

My dear Lafargue, I am sending the Manuscript to you by registered post with a few comments—as always the translation is excellent.
517 There has been a delay of a few days, and this is why; in Berlin they want to reprint the three articles by Marx on the events in France in 1848-49 (published in 1850 in the Revue de la Nouvelle Gazette Rhénanea and this cannot be done without an introduction; 507 this introduction has become quite long, since besides a general review of the events since that date, it would be necessary to explain why we were right to expect the imminent and definitive victory of the proletariat, why that has not come about, and to what point events have modified the way we saw things then.
This is important because of the new laws which are threatening us in Germany.
428 A Reichstag Commission is attempting to transform all the articles of the penal code into rubber articles which are applicable or not, depending on the political party to which the defendant belongs.

requested by Williamc—if the electors do not become involved.
For our bourgeois deputies are so cowardly that even the courage of cowardice may prove lacking.
In any case, we are striding towards a cris is, if there can be a crisis in this Germany of the Bourgeoisie, where ever ything is blunted.
What is certain is that there will be a new age of persecution for our friends.
As for us, our policy should be not to let ourselves be provoked at this point; we would be fighting without the least chance of succe ss, and we would be bled like Paris in 1871, whereas in two or three years our forces may have doubled, as under the exceptional law.
15 Today our Party would be fighting alone against all the others, rallied around the government unde r the banner of social order; in two or three years we will have on our side the peasants and the petty- bourgeois crushed by taxation.
The battle corps does not engage in frontline battles but reserves itself for the critical moment.
Anyway, we shall see how it ends.
How ironical that you, one of the most French writers of our age, should be doomed to be published almost always in German! And what German! The translators of Berlin and Stuttgart display a truly Germanic heaviness.

There is no way of discussing with this generation of Russians to which he belongs, and which still believes in the spontaneous-communist mission which distinguishes Russia, the true Holy Russ,c from other profane peoples.
As for the rest, in a country such as yours, where largescale modern industry is grafted onto the primitive peasant commune, and where all the intermediary stages of civilisation are represented simultaneously, in a country which, in addition, is surr ounded more or less effectively by an intellectual wall of China erected by despotism, it is scarcely surprising if the most bizarre and impossible combinations of ideas are produced.
Take the poor devil Flerovsky, who imagines that tables and beds think, but have no memory.
It is a phase the country must pass through.
Little by little, with the growth of the towns, the isolation of men of talent will disappear, and with it these mental aberrations caused by loneliness, the inconsistency of the patchy knowledge of these curious thinkers, and also a little, in the Narodniki,d by the despair of seeing their hopes evaporate.

No.
928, communal agricultural land.
This draft goes into too much detail for me to pass knowledgeable judgement on it.
First of all one would need to know whether, in the great majority of cases, this communal land does not consist of forests, moorland, heath or, at very most, land suitable only for grazing, and where agriculture proper cannot be practiced to advantage.
Such is the case in Germany and, if I am not mistaken, in a large part of northern France.
In these cases, farming such land, unless kept within very narrow territorial confines, would risk falling into the errors of the National Workshops of 1848.
525 However, as I have just said, one needs very specialised knowledge to form an opinion on this subject.

A measure very useful both as an example for the capitalists, and as a means of propaganda; however, the day before yesterday the workers abandoned the County Council Progressives who had one point that seems to me to be dubious; whether it is wise to promise 40 million annually to the peasants in a form and for a purpose so clearly defined.
The peasants could one day present us with this promissory note, and at a time when we might have better uses for such a sum.
Thank you for your comments concerning Wroblewskia.
I have calculated that the roughly 45 socialist deputies receive a total of 400,000 fr.
annually from the state, and that it would not perhaps be wholly impossible to provide on the basis of this sum, an annual income of, say, 1,200 francs to the sole surviving general of the Commune.
I am perfectly well aware that the requests made by electoral constituenci es on the funds of their deputies are not very reasonable, but here it seems to me to be a question of the honour of the whole of revolutionary France.
It will be difficult to make the world understand that the survivors of a nd successors to the Commune are represented in the house by 45 deputies, and that a party of this size is not, however, capable of guaranteeing its most senior general against the most extreme poverty.
And indeed, I still dare to hope that it will be found pos- sible to use this means of enabling him to live out his life, without exposing him to the humiliation of a public subscription.

My dear Sir, I am very sorry, in reply to your kind letter of Jan.
29th, to inform you that our authorb has not left any manuscripts relating to his views upon, and deductions from the state of landed property in Russia such as might be useful to the Russian translator.
527 All I have been able to find a Nicholas II - b Karl Marx translator, a friend of Dr.
Lux, had better apply to you direct for your permission.
To avoid indiscretion, he insisted that the letter to you should be sent through him.
The translator, a young Russianb in Berlin, was said to be capable of undertaking the work (Dr.
Lux’s wife is a Russian lady), and Dr.
Lux has promised to revise the German text in order to insure correctness.
The translator is also said to have occupied himself with economical subjects, so as to be no stranger to the contents of your book.
The letter enclosed seems to assume that your consent has already been given, at least I cannot find in it any tr ace of a formal request to you to that effect.
I know that some young Russians abroadc are of opinion that such is an unnecessary formality, but such is not my opinion, and if you feel inclined to entertain at all Mr.
Konov’s proposal, I think a hint in that direction might do the young man good.
As to myself I know nothing at all of the intended translation.
If you will kindly send me your reply to Mr Konov, I will see that it is forwarded at once.

Dear Fischer, I have taken as much account as possible of your grave objections al- though I cannot for the life of me see what is objectionable about, say, half of the instances you cite.
529 For I cannot after all assume that you intend to subscribe heart and soul to ab solute legality, legality under any circumstances, legality even vis-à-vis laws infringed by their promulgators, in short, to the policy of turning the left cheek to him, who has struck you on the right.
True, the Vorwärts sometimes expends almost as much energy on repudiating revolution as once it did—and may soon do again—on advocating the same.
But I cannot regard that as a criterion.
My view is that you have nothing to gain by advocating complete ab- stention from force.
Nobody would believe you, nor would any party in any country go so far as to forfeit the right to resist illegality by force of arms.
I also have to take account of the fact that my stuff is read by foreigners as well—Frenchmen, Englishmen, Swiss, Austrians, Italians, etc.
—and I simply cannot compromise myself to that extent in their eyes.
I have therefore accepted your amendm ents with the fo llowing exceptions: 1.

Braun was good enough to send me and was glad at long last to find such appreciation of Capitalc at a German university.
Needless to say, I cannot identify myself with all the expressions into which y ou have transposed Marx’s exposition.
In particular, it seems to me that the definitions of the concept of value, given by you on pp.
576 and [5] 77, are rather too generalised; for one thing, I should delimit them historically by expressly confining them to the economic phase in which alone there has and c ould have been any question of value hitherto—to the social form s in which exchange of commodities and production of commodities exist; prim itive communism was innocent of value.
And in the second place the propos ition would also seem to me to be susceptible of a conceptually narrower formulation.
But this would take us too far afield and on the whole you are certainly right in what you say.
On p.
586, however, you appeal directly to me and I could not but laugh at the unconcerned way in which you hold a pistol to my head.
But you need not worry—I am not going to ‘contradict you flat’.
The conceptual transitions whereby Marx arrives at th e general and equal rate of profit from the various values produced in individual capitalist concerns, namely s/c = s/(c+v), are wholly foreign to the consciousness of the individual capitalist.
In so far as they have any historical parallel or any reality outside our own heads, this consists in, say the fact that the individual constituents of the amount of surplus value produced by capitalist a W.

- c Volume II I something that was the diametrical opposite of what was achieved, or else that achievement entailed consequences quite other than those that had been foreseen.
If we apply this to political economy, we find that each individual capitalist is in pursuit of bigger profits for himself.
Bourgeois economics reveals that this pursuit of bigger profits on the part of each individual capitalist results in a general and equal rate of profit, an approximately equal rate of profit for all.
But neither capitalists nor bourgeois economists are aware that the real purpose of that pursu it is the equal percentual distribution of the total surplus value over capital as a whole.
But how did this process of equalisation really come about? That is a very interesting point about wh ich Marx himself has little to say.
But Marx’s whole way of thinking [Auffassungsweise] is not so much a doctrine as a method.
It provides, not so much ready-made dogmas, as aids to further investigation and the method for such investigation.
Here, then, is a piece of work to be done which Marx himself did not attempt in his first draft.

Dear Schmidt, I have before me your two letters of the 13th of November last and of the 1st of this month.

side-tracked when it came to the rate of profit.
In it I find you lapsing into detail in just the same way, and for this I blame the eclectic method of philosophising endemic at German uni versities since 1848, a method which loses sight of the whole, and all too often goes astray by indulging in almost endless and unprofitable speculation on minutiae.
Now it so happens that your earlier studies of classical philosophy revolved primarily around Kant, and Kant was more or less compelled by the then state of philosophising in Germany and by his own antipathy to Wolf’s pedantic Leibnizianism to make what appeared to be formal con cessions to Wolfian speculation.
It is thus I explain your tendency, also apparent from your epistolatory digression on the law of value, to become engro ssed in minutiae; hence your occasional failure, or so it seems to me, to see the wood for the trees, which is why you reduce the law of value to a fiction, a necessary fiction, in much the same way as Kant reduced the existence of G od to a postulate of practical reason.
Your objections to the law of value apply to all concepts regarded from the standpoint of reality.
The identity of thinking and being, to use a Hegelian expression, corresponds in all respects to your example of the circle and the polygon.
In other words, the c oncept of an object and its reality run side by side like two asymptotes which, though constantly a Vol.
II I of Capital businesses over a succession of years.
If, however, we were to insist that the rate of profit—say, 14.

.
.
be exactly the same down to the last decimal point in every business every year, on pain of being reduced to a fiction, we should be grossly mistaking the nature of the rate of profit and of economic laws generally—they none of them have any reality save as an approximation, a tendency, an average, but not as immediate reality.
This is due partly to the fact that their action is frustrated by the simultaneous action of other laws, but also to some extent by their nature as concepts.
Or take the law of wages, the realisation of the value of the power of labour, a value which is only, and even then not always, realised as an av- erage and varies from locality to locality, indeed from branch to branch, according to the standard of living cu stomary in each.
Or ground rent, which represents the surplus profit, in excess of the general rate, arising from a monopolisation of a natural force.
Here, too, real surplus profit and real rent do not by any means automatically correspond, but do so only approximately and on an average.
Exactly the same thing applies to the law of value and the distribution of surplus value through the rate of profit.
1.
Both come closest to full realisation only in as much as capitalist production has everywhere been fully implemented, i.
e.
society has been a self-evidently because their labour power is not paid for in full; c) the total amount of surplus value from which, however, we must again deduct that portion that is presented to the buyer, especially at times of crisis when overproduction is reduced to its true content of socially necessary labour.
From this it necessarily follows that the total profit and the total surplus value can correspond only approximately.
If, however, you also consider that neither the total surplus value nor the total capital are constant quantities but variables which change from day to day, then any correspondence between the rate of profit and Σs/Σ(c+v), other than an approximate progression, and any coincidence of the total price and total value other than one which constantly tends towards, and yet as constantly tends away from, unity, will be seen to be a sheer impossibility.
In other words, the unity of concept and phenomenon turns out to be an essentially endless process, and so indeed it is, in this case as in every other.
Has feudalism, then, ever corresponded to its concept? Having begun in the Kingdom of the Western Franks, 537 been further developed in Normandy by the Norwegian invaders, and taken a stage further in England and the south of Italy by the Norman French, it came closest to its concept—in the ephemeral Kingdom of Jerusalem, a relic of which, the Assises de Jérusalem, 538 the most classical expression of the feudal order.
Was that order a fiction merely because it was in Palestine alone that it achieved a short-lived exis- scorn on the folly of supposing that a mammal could lay eggs, and now it has been proven! So do not treat the concept of value in the same manner as has obliged me to proffer my belated apologies to the duck-billed platypus! In Sombart’s otherwise excellent article on Volume II P I have also found a similar tendency to emasculate the theory of value; evidently he, too, had hoped to find a rather different solution.
15 Your article in the Centralblatt, however, is first-rate,c and your dem- onstration—by quantitative determination—of the specific differences between Marx’s theory of the rate of profit and that of the earliest political economists, is very well done.
In his wisdom, the illustrious Loria sees Volume II I as nothing less than an abandonment of the theory of value,d and thus your article is a cut-and-dried reply.
There are now two more interested parties, Labriola in Rome, and Lafargue, the latter having joined battle with Loria in the Critica Sociale.

Sombart’s article is very good,a except that his view of the law of value is impaired by some disappointment over the solution to the rate of profit question.
He clearly expected a miracle, instead of which he merely found what was rational and that is anything but miraculous.
Hence his reduction of the significance of the law of value to the domination of the productive force of labour as the determining economic power.
This is all much too generalised and imprecise.
—Little Conrad Schmidt’s article in the Sozial politisches Centralblatt is very good.
b Eduard Bernstein’s articles were very muddle- headedc; the man is still neurasthenic and, what is more, scandalously over- worked.
Having too many other things on hand, he left the article on one side and then was suddenly dunned for it by K.

Part VI.

37 and 38 important.
39 and 40 less so, but nevertheless not to be skipped.
41-43 demand rather less attention.
(Differential rent II , individual cases.
) 44-47 are again important and also, on the whole, easy to read.
Part VII very fine; unfortunately truncated and, moreover, strongly symptomatic of insomnia.
So if you make a thorough study of the essentials by following the above, and devote less attention initially to what is of lesser importance (preferably having first reread the essential bits of Vol.

But I suppose it’s just the typical Anglo-Saxon way of going about things.

Dear Sir, Following are my brief answers to your questions: a Arbeiter-Zeitung 7) If by the Central Association 549 you mean the central section of democratic associations, led by the Frankfurt Left, I must say the Rhenish democrats soon lost trust in it and made themselves independent.
8) We were on the same good terms with Becker as with the other bourgeois democratic leaders in Cologne, without making a secret of the fact that we were going considerably furt her than they and without expecting them to unconditionally support the stance taken by the Neue Rheinische Zeitung.
The majority of them, Becker included, were not contributors to the paper, except, at the most, for publishing short, usually signed, articles from time to time in the local news section (then printed ‘under the line’).
You will often come across the initials H.
B.
550 there.
After the onset of reaction, in the autumn of 1848, democracy became more radical and Becker also drew closer to us.
But he did not work more for the paper then either.
9) I’ve no knowledge of this at all.
551 I was already gone by then, we left Cologne in May.
10) After we had gone, Becker and Heinrich Burgers founded the Westdeutsche Zeitung, one might say on the inheritance of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung? 552 11) I have no further material on the Communist trial 553 concerning a Hermann Heinrich Becker - b of the Neue Rheinische Zeitung times he again became what he had b een previously, a bourgeois democrat, and, as you will know, went through a ll the changes undergone by German, and particularly Prussian, bourgeois democracy.
This attitude stemmed from his whole nature, so I am far removed from seeing any sort of careerism in it; on the contrary, if he had tried to remain more radical and carry the communist episode on, he would have mi ssed his calling.
In this he differed, very favourably, from Miquel.
I hope these notes will be of use to you.

Before I got your letter of 19 Octobe r, friends in Barcelona had asked Comrade Eleanor Marx-Aveling to inform the British Trades-Unions of the Malaga strikers’ situation, and she ha d done all she could, so that nothing more is left for me to do.
And as you know, some of the Trades-Unions helped.
As regards really socialist organisations in England, they are so disunited and so poor that no help can be expected from them.
I have been following the progress of this strike with great interest, admiring the workers’ tenacity and courage.
Marquis de Larios’ name reminds me of an episode that occurred about 1850.
At that time there was a firm of Larios Bros.
(Jews) in Gibraltar.
A British merchant used to send his goods to the firm on commission to be smuggled to other merchants on Spanish territory .
Those goods were constantly seized by Spanish Customs, and Larios Bros, would pay the Englishman the guaranteed sum in insurance, as is customary in this kind of business.
But that did not suit the Englishman, for he lost his customers in Spain and a substantial amount of profit.
He arrived in Gibraltar to see for himself why those accidents always befell his goods but never those of others.
However, he could not find out the reason.
One day as he was taking a walk in the city, he saw a cart lose a wheel and some boxes with goods fall to the ground and burst open.
The boxes were a See this volume, p.

Dear Hirsch, I am willing to oblige you, 555 but only on two conditions: 1.
that the general a term.
What mode of produc tion have you in mind here? ‘The minimum of socially necessary labour time’—if this is supposed to be the time needed to produce the gross social product, it is meaningless so far as capitalist society is concerned, since in its apportionment among individual workers, the industrial reserve army is wholly left out of account.
P.
15.
‘Everywhere’ (etc.
, up till the end of the sentence)—this is ex- pressed very obscurely, to say the least and, as it stands, is a contradiction.
First, the increase in the products of labour is said to give rise to ‘a gain as such’ and then to a ‘loss of value, which is at least a possibility’.
This will not do unless explanatory and delimiting intermediate links are provided.
P.
18.
‘The capital of the working man is his own person.
’ That sounds very nice, but in this context the word capital loses every vestige of meaning.
Why the devil must you go and translate things that are sensible into nonsensical philistine cliches? What you say here is quite beyond my comprehension.
Similarly on p.
18, no.
2.
The concentration of labour re- sulting from improvements in machinery is all of a sudden supposed to be unhealthy.
It may be so, and very often is, in the capitalist system but of itself it is no more unhealthy than is eating and digesting on the following page.
Not only will it not cease, but we shall be able to augment it considerably because, with it, we shall get co mpensation for the workers.
Other all your propositions as having been deduced from real life, while you yourself will learn something in the process.
Now, do your best in the Cologne by-election 556 so that we may at least win here.
And if by chance you should be writing to me again, let me know if the old house, behind Hutmacher, where the Neue Rheinische Zeitung used to be, is still no.
17 and whether the owner of the sweatshop who now lives there is called Salomon or Lewi—I have forgotten.
So far you have been conducti ng your battle with the Centre 71 quite nicely, but it seems to me that you might castigate the conduct of the Liebers et al in the Reichstag rather more often in your leading articles.

Dear Hermann, Many thanks for the kind wedding invitation which I am unfortunately unable to accept.
Apart from other obstacl es, I have again fallen prey to the springtime complaint which, for the past four or five years, has regularly crippled me for some weeks at this season.
A little rest will no doubt suffice to put paid to the thing, thus enabling me, a week tomorrow, to drink a glass of the best to ElsbethV and her bridegroom’sb health, as will be conscientiously done.
Otherwise I am well and have grown more or less accustomed to the domestic and dietary regulations befitting an elderly gentleman—so much so, in fact, that any deviation there from becomes instantly apparent to me from all manner of little upsets and I get given the well-meant but earnest advice to desist from the same in future.

The text explains that the contents ar e a reprint of the old articles from the Neue Rheinische Zeitung, Revue.
My text has suffered to some extent from the apprehensive objections, in spired by the Subversion Bill, 428 of our friends in Berlin—objections of which, in the circumstances, I could not but take account.
529 I at once wrote to Plekhanov to clear up the misunderstanding.
a It was very right of you to stave off Ferri; the chap is a belletrist and sensation- monger in no matter what field and, like most Italians, holds Loria to be a giant in the field of economics, an opinion the illustrious one has implanted in them by dint of ‘reiterated appearan ces’ (to use Ruge’s expression) and by a refined system of camaraderie.
I have not read the stenographic version of Liebknecht’s militia speech 360 and one cannot go by the newspaper re ports.
A long dissertation might be written on the subject of militia and the standing army.
If France and Germany were to agree gradually to turn their armies into militias, each with the same period of training, that would be that; Russia could be left to her own devices and Austria and Italy would be delighted to follow suit.
But because of domestic circumstances Fr ance and Germany cannot afford to do this and, even if they could, it w ould not be feasible because of Alsace- Lorraine.
And that will prove the undoing of the whole of the militia business.

The other countries don’t really matter.
For years past I have been intending to make use of the material in my possession for a biography of Marx and, in fact, it is this, as it happens to be quite the most important part, that I shall do first.
A number of cir- cumstances make this necessary.
Firstly, I was personally involved during the crucial period, 1870-72, and can fill out the material from my own experience.
Secondly, it is at one and the same time the most important episode in Marx’s public life and that least amenable to accurate portrayal from printed sources.
Thirdly, the calumnies to be disposed of belong for the most part to this period.

But its political success seems assured and, that being so, it would be very strange if it didn’t eventually prove a financial success also.
Electoral reforms 270 that would enable us to get into parliament are, I consider, a virtual certainty in Austria, unless a period of general reaction were suddenly to set in.
In Berlin they would seem to be making determined efforts in that direction, but unfortunately no one there knows his own mind from one day to the next.

47, My dear Löhr, If you were in danger of being flooded, it was just the reverse with us— four weeks without water, and at the end of the frost the canalisation blocked up as the result.
A fine mess it was.
London was thrown back into barbarism by this month of hard frost, and the Standard with truly British Conservatism congratulated us on the fact that the non-supply of water was a proof of the high civilisation attained here, while it pitied the uncivilised cities of the Continent where the water-pipes had not frozen.
Well, thank goodness, it’s over.
You grumble at the mythical union and real squabbles of the French Socialists—they are babies at that game , compared to the English.
They are especially interesting—the English Socialists I mean—since Social Democratic Federation 44 and Independent Labour Party 114 fight each other under the cloak of a pretended harmony.
This harmony goes exactly as far as their common hatred of John Burns, and allows the Social Democratic Federation to invite Keir Hardie to speak at their Commune meeting; at which meeting Keir Hardie (read his speech in the Labour Leadera) directs hidden attacks against the Social Democratic Federation to which that body replies in Justice.
b The Social Democratic Federation says the Independent Labour Party has no right to exist, the Social Democratic Federation being the a No.

584, 23 March 1895: Topical Tattle ‘Socialists’ prefer to support the party which refuses to allow London its self- government and fights hard to keep the County Council powerless.
Now the County Council is the next and best and easiest-to-be -conquered piece of governmental machinery—the working class could have it tomorrow if they were united.
And what would Parliament be with a Socialist autonomous Council for London! The Berlin people are republishing Mohr’s articles in the Revue der Neuen Rheinischen Zeitung on France 1848-50 and I have written an introduction which will probably first appear in the Neue Zeit.
It has suffered somewhat from the, as I think, exaggerated desires of our Berlin friends not to say anything which might be used as a means to assist in the passing of the Umsturzvorlage in the Reichstag.
428 Under the circumstances I had to give way.
529 But this Umsturzvorlage and the absolutely uncertain state of things in Germany—splendid though it be for the general progress of our party— upsets a good deal of my calculations .
I was, I believe you know, getting ready the Lassalle correspondence; 284 for that I have to compare a lot of old papers, letters, etc.
But if the new bill passes, neither the letters nor my notes and introduction will be printable in Germany.
And a reprint of our old articles of 1843-52 will be equally impossi ble.

My dear Lafargue, I had not yet finished reading your half-book 567 when I received Vol.
I of the History of Socialism by Kautsky, 561 various Italian reviews concern- in which that phase has been maintained up to our own times, in France, and on the form of its dissolution in that country.
The form of coparcenary under which the consanguineous community has gone on so long in France is already in itself a subdivision of the large family community, continued to our day in the zádruga of the Serbians and Bulgarians.
This form, it appears certain, preceded the peasant commune in Russia, in Germany, etc.
; in breaking up, the Slav zádruga, the German Hausgenossenschaft (genealogy of lex Alamannorum 575 ) passed over to the commune of separate families (or, quite often at first, and still toda y in Russia, to coparcenaries), with separately cultivated fields though subject to periodic redistribution —that is to say, what emerged from it was the Russian mira and the German Markgenossenschaft.
The more restricted community of several families which was kept up in France was no more, as I see it, than an integral part of the Markgenossenschaft, at any rate in the North (the Frankish region); in the South (former Aquitaine) it may perhaps have formed a unity holding its land under the superior ownership of the lord of the manor alone, without being subject to the control of the village commune.
It is only this special French form which, on breaking up, could pass in one leap to the individual ownership of the land.

So far as the Russians are concerned, it is normal practice to encroach upon an author’s rights without so much as your leave ‘in the interests of propaganda’, not to speak of the interests, as is frequently the case, of their own private printing-shop and publishing house, as opposed to those of others.
579 Up till now, however, I have not b een accustomed to that kind of thing when dealing with Germans.
Had I only known what I had merely suspected, namely that the old Rheinische Zeitung is in the Berlin Library, I should have gone there back in 1893 580 and looked it out, in which case we should have made a good deal more progress in regard to other matters too.

154-157b though it has not been elaborated or emphasi sed with sufficient exactitude, a cir- cumstance that has persuaded me to enlarge briefly on the above point in the Neue Zeit with reference to Sombart’sc and your objections.
In any case there is a further point regard ing which I should like to make an addition to Volume II I and bring it into line with the situation today by taking account of certain changes in economic conditions since 1865.
534 But if I am to develop that point concerning the effectiveness and validity of the law of value, it would make thing easier for me if you would permit me to make mention, not only of the ‘hypothesis’ of your Centralblatt article,d but also of the ‘fiction’ you discuss in your two letters and to quote one or two passages from them for the purpose of defining more precisely what you mean by the hypothesis of the article.
So would you kindly reread the passage alluded to above and then tell me whether I may say that the aforesaid quotations were extracted from letters by Dr C.
Schmidt to myself.
Should you be convinced by Marx’ passage that, where the production of commodities is concerned, the law of value is, after all, rather more than a necessary fiction, we should then see eye to eye, and in that case I should of course be glad to dispense with this.

But in view of the fact that we used to write in a very unrestrained way and were forever justifying things which, in the territories of the German Empire, ar e regarded either as a crime or an offence, a re-issue in Berlin after the passing of that exemplary Bill would be quite impossible without numerous deletions.
Secondly, however, I have a scheme for again presenting Marx’s and my lesser writings to the public in a complete edition —not, that is to say, by instalments but all at one go, in whole volumes.
I have already been in correspondence with Augusta on the subject and we are still discussing it.
So you might have a word with him when he gets back.
I am by no means certain that an enterprise like this is really your cup of tea, nor do I know whether you, i.
e.
the publishing side of the Vorwärts, are the best people for the job—quite aside from the harassmen t of the press which has already inclined me to believe that we may be forced to have recourse to a publisher outside the German Empire.
Marx would never have consented to the issue of a work by instalments.
In the case of the 2nd Ed.
of Capital I he once allowed Meissner to bring out seven big instalments, each of some seven sheet s, but that was as much as he could stomach.

For if the management of the Socialiste is to serve as a pattern, woe be unto us! The Vorwärts announces the complete reorga nisation of that illustrious paper, published ‘mit Ausschluss der Oeffentlichkeit’,e and that Chauvin has remodelled the publishing department 588—if so, il est tellement chauvinf that nobody here has seen a trace of it.

Dear Fischer, One further matter: Would you please take another look at the old Rheinische Zeitung with regard to the Mosel articles 584 to find out whether some sort of polemic may not have arisen over the things and if so whether there are also articles under Marx’s usual pseudonym and written in his own style—short, antithetically expressed sentences—as well as any other shorter articles under the same pseudonym and stylistically the same.
If there are, let me know.
I can no longer remember my own articles—the best of them fell foul of the censor—or even my pseudonym; most of the longer ones, i.

those that are not merely day to day reports, are in the supplement or the feuilleton.

to help me hunt out Marx’s early writings for republication.
The first difficulty to confront me was the Rheinische Zeitung of 1842, which I had imagined to be in the Berlin Library.
Despite numerous inquiries, I was unable to ascertain whether it was actually there, but now that that point has been cleared up, we can make a start.
Marx was in Bonn up till October 1842.
When I passed through at the end of September or the beginning of October on my return from Berlin, the editorial board consisted, so far as I recall, only of M.
Hess and Dr Rave, a former editor of the Elberfelder Zeitung (which was, I believe, known by another name at the time).
Rutenberg had, I believe, already been expelled, though I am not sure about that.
When I dropped in again towards the end of November on my way to England, I ran into Marx there and that was the occasion of our first, distinctly chilly meeting.
Marx had meanwhile taken a stand against the Bauers, i.
e.
he had said he was opposed not only to the Rheinische Zeitung becoming predominantly a vehicle for theological propaganda, atheism, etc.
, rather than for political discussion and action, but also to Edgar Bauer’s hot air brand of communism, which was based on a sheer love of ‘going to extremes’ and was soon after replaced by Edgar with other kinds of extremist hot air.
Since I corresponded with the Bauers, I was regarded as their ally, whereas they cau sed me to view Marx with suspicion.
To the best of my recollection Marx resigned—at any rate officially— from the post of editor en chef on I January 1843.
That, however, did not prevent him from surreptitiously contributing to the paper up to and including February.
I think I am equally right in saying that the ukase requiring the paper to close down on 31 March 1843 was served on it no later than 31 December.
Negotiations then began, the result of One of the best pieces in the Rheinische Zeitung, again in the feuilleton, is a long critique of Leo’s History of the French Revolution.
It is my Marx’s friend C.
F.
Köppenc (who also wrote about old Fritzd and Norse mythologye) and (for the first time in any language) gives a correct expla- nation for the reign of terror.
Certain quotations and retrospective insights in your articles in the Neue Zeit have already shown me that you have made a thorough study of the period previous to 1848.
1 am glad that it has fallen to you to deal with this, as well as with the later period in respect of Germany.
There might possibly be one or two more things of Marx’s in the sup- plement for the period prior to October 1842; it would hardly be worth your while to search out smaller items from Bonn in the main part of the paper.

Dear Mr Mehring, Very many thanks for your long and informative letter plus enclosures, which I shall reply to at length as soon as my cranium permits.
Unfortunately for the past week a rheumatic condition of the scalp has been encircling and compressing it as though with a band of iron.
I hope to have got over it by next week along with the attendant insomnia.
Meanwhile I agree to your proposal that the only articles from the Rheinische Zeitung that should be published in their entirety are the two long ones and those on Communisma (as also the article from the Anekdotab).
It would only be necessary to copy from the remainder such passages as you might be so good as to indicate as being the most pregnant (along with particulars of the context).
As regards the Mosel articles, 584 it would be desirable if my introduction included a brief outline both of the course of the debate and of the contents.
Would you be kind enough to acquaint Fischer with the foregoing? Once again my best thanks and until my next, which has to do with one minor detail, I remain Yours sincerely F.

Printed according to the original Published in English for the first time a See previous letter both you and Paul were ready and willing to come over here for a bit, and I should have written at once in reply, had it not been for those confounded pains which for a week nearly drove me mad and even now have not left me, anything but painless, but extremely stupid and unfit for anything.
The fact is this.
Some time ago I got a swelling on the right side of the neck, which after some time resolved itself into a bunch of deep-seated glands infiltrated by some cause or other.
The pains arose from direct pressure of that lump on the nerve and will of course only give way when that pressure disappears.
At present a process of resorption is going on very satisfactorily, but a couple of these glands are suppurating and will have to be cut; and as they are so deep- seated and slow in coming to the surf ace, and we old peopl e being such slow coaches, the time for the operation cannot be exactly fixed, but it is hoped will come off this week.
That once performed I am ordered to the sea-side; but the uncertainty is still about the time.
Now as things are situated, would it not be the best thing for you to come over say in the course of next week, and then as soon as possible you and I could bundle off to Eastbourne 596 and settle down in comfortable quarters and prepare for visitors from London.
I say you and I, because I intend to keep you here a good bit longer than very likely Paul would care to separate himself from his studies and your animals and the garden work; so he perhaps would prefer to do as you say and come tumbling after.
When I shall have cleared out from here, Louise intends giving my two rooms a good cleaning down and after that she might come and join us with her baby for a week or so; after that Tussy and Edward might come, and then Paul who by that time is sure to be tired of his solitude, and then Ever yours, F.

Dear (.
.
.
)a You have set us a difficult task.
We are to seek out ‘the journalist Tollittb England’ as also those ‘English papers ’ containing the relevant details about Brauweiler.
598 In the first place, the English daily press does not even mention the name Braunweiler in its accounts of the case.
The report of a Parliamentary Committee is not, however, published until its work has been completed.
So the item must doubtless have emanated from some obscure trade paper and will therefore be impossi ble to trace in this country.
In the second place, no one here knows the journalist Tollitt, who according to some is called Pollitt.
Dr Freyberger tried in vain to track him down at the NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB which has a vast number of journalists amongst its members.
We have now taken further steps in order to discover the man if possible—it seems quite clear that he does not live in London or work for the political press; more likely he is in some trade branch—though that will take time.
But it is very naive of you to expect that he would appear over there as witness on your behalf.
After all, he himself says that he got into the prisons by stealth, and conseque ntly be would at once be thrown into jug in Cologne for bribery of officials or something of the kind, and put on trial.

Dear Baron, I should have replied at once to your letter of the 6th had not a nasty inflammation of the glands in my neck, accompanied by much pain and inevitable loss of sleep, rendered me almost wholly incapable of work during the past two weeks.
But now you are to be kept waiting no longer.
At the time in question you took it upon yourselves to produce a a See this volume, p.
514 manner of people kept surreptitiously inquiring what conn ection I had with the thing, whether I had refused to collaborate, etc.
And then at length, when silence could no longer be maintained, the good Ede got round to mentioning the subject with a sheepishness and embarrassment that would have been worthy of a worse cause—though nothing wrong had been done save for this absurd play-acting which, in the m eantime, as Louise can testify, has enlivened many a dull hour for me.
Well and good.
You have presented me with a fait accompli; a History of Socialism on which I have not collaborated.
I have accepted the fact without complaint from the very start.
But that fact is of your own making, nor can you do away with or ignore it, should this ever happen to suit your purpose.
And neither can I do away with it.
If, on mature reflection, you chose to slam the front door in my face at a time when my advice and help might have been of material use to you, please do not expect of me that I should now slink in through some little back door in order to help you out of a quandary.
I must admit that, had the roles been reversed, I should have reflected for a very, very long time before coming to you with a request such as this one.
600 Is it really so terribly difficult to see that ev eryone must bear the consequences of his own actions? As YOU MADE YOUR BED so YOU MUST LIE IN IT .
If there is no room for me here, it is only because you wanted it so.
Well, that settles that.
And now you would oblige me by considering this reply as irrevocable.
Let us both regard the whole incident as finished many more important economic analyses of political events there are also some commonplaces which would seem to indicate a gap in your studies.
I have learnt a great deal from your book which is indispensible preliminary reading for my new edition of The Peasant War.
235 It would seem to me to have two main faults—1.
Very inadequate research into the development and role of the déclassé, almost pariah- like elements who had no place whatever in the feudal system and who were the inevitable outcome of urban development,, It is they who in all cases formed the lowest stratum of urban population in the Middle Ag es—devoid of rights and set apart from village communities, craft guilds and feudal dependence.
Though difficult, this should serve as your main basis, for by degrees, with the dissolution of the feudal bonds, these elements became the pre-proletariat which, in 1789, was responsible for the revolution in the faubourgs’ 3 of Paris and absorbed all the outcasts of feudal and guild society.
You talk of proletarians—a term which is inapt—amongst whom you comprise weavers whose importance you quite rightly stress—but you can count them among your ‘proletariat’ only after, and in so far as, déclassé journeymen weavers cam e into existence outside of the guilds.
There is still much room for improvement here.
2.
You have not fully grasped the position of Germany—her international economic position in so far as it is possible to speak of any such a Kautsky, Von Plato bis zu den Wiedertäufern —b suburbs completely new subject, and you cannot expect to attain perfection straight away.
You should be glad to have produced a book that is presentable, even at this stages when it is, as it were, in its initial draft form.
Now, however, you are both honour-bound not to allow the ground you have broken to lie fallow but to continue with your researches so that, in a few years’ time, you will be able to bring out a new edition capable of meeting every requirement.
Someone in St Petersburg has sent me a Russian translation of your old piece on marriage and the familya (Kosmos) .

Dear Editors, The man has been found, is called Ja mes Pollitt, and is ready to do any- thing within reason.

The articles are in The Hardwareman, 11 and 18 May—stenographic reports of the sessions of the BOARD OF TRADE COMMITTEE on convict labour abroad, at which his statements were made.
These are being sent to you in the original with translations of the passages relating to Braunweiler.
He will further supply us with samples of th e commodities produced in Braunweiler and sold over here, and also an affi davit as to the accuracy both of his statements before the Committee and of the excerpts quoted by you.
But since the material is very ample and would not lend itself to being paraphrased in a letter in such a way as to put you in a position to make full use of it in court, a personal discussion is urgently called for.

I am taking leave to enclose a copy of this little work, just off the press, with the request of kindly contributing to its circulation by mentioning it in the Jahrbücher 622 When an occasion offers itself.
I need hardly say that it is calculated for a public with roughly the educational level of a student.
Perhaps I will take the liberty of soon sending you an article for the Jahrbücher which, without reference to an y particular recently published work, deals with the Christian poetry of the Middle Ages, notably with its central figure, Dante.
This is done in the context of the perspectives opened up by Feuerbach.
623 Meanwhile I am sending you my regards and best wishes for the success of the Jahrbücher.

Apart from th e diseased glands of the neck there is danger either from weakness of the heart or from pneumonia—and in either of these two cases the end would be sudden.
He may go on for some weeks if pneumonia does not intervene, but if it does then it will be a question of a few hours.
In spite of all, however, the General is quite hopeful and is certain that he will recover—he intends, and has arranged with the 2 doctors, to return to London on Wednesday eveningb so that if you want to see him you had better go to 41 R.

This is sad news and I trust the doctors may be mistaken.
There is so much work to be done which the General alone is capable of doing, that his loss will be irreparable from a public point of view—to his friends it will be a calamity.
I have just time to write this in haste.

Addressing the 10th Congress of the French Workers’ Party on 25 September 1892 in Marseille (see Note 11) as a representativ e of German Social-Democracy, Wilhelm Liebknecht said the following, partly on the outcome of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 and partly on the seizure of Alsace-Lorraine by Germany: ‘.
.
.
the matter would be settled without any trouble once the social and democr atic Republic was established on both sides of the Rhine.
’ This statement triggered rabid attacks in the French bourgeois press against the Socialists.
Thus, in its editorial note of September 28 titled ‘Herr Liebknecht’, the newspaper La France urged his immediate expulsion from France.
Meanwhile, Lucien Millevoye, deputy for the Nord in the Chambe r of Deputies, asked the Minister of the Interior: ‘Following the example of Mr.
Lie bknecht, does the government of the Republic intend to tolerate that foreigners should come to France in order to arouse hatred and con- tempt for the French nation?’ 6.

However, the names of the authors were not indicated therei n—it was said in the Manifesto that the text was written by ‘one of our oldest and most respected comrades in London’.
On 23 November 1871 the Committee members appeared before the district court on charges of breaking the public order laws and affiliati on with the International Working Men’s Association.
The court sentenced the accused to prison terms ranging from 5 to 16 months.
The sentence was commuted on appeal to 3 m onths, including the period of preliminary detention; it meant that they were virtually acquitted.

Addressing a Reichstag session on 27 July 1870, August Bebel supported the Reichstag’s refusal to vote for credits to finance the wa r against France.
On 26 November 1870, when the German Reichstag took up this issue again, Bebel and Liebknecht demanded that credits be refused and peace with the French Republic promptly concluded w ithout annexations.
On 28 November the entire Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag, together with Bebel and Liebknecht, voted against the granting of war credits.
After the Reichstag session closed on 17 December Bebel, Liebknecht and Hepner were arrested and charged with high treason.
9.
All the required materials mentioned in the letter were handed over to Paul Lafargue through Engels.
But since Lafargue’s planned statem ent in the Chamber of Deputies never took place, Lafargue used them s ubsequently in his pamphlet La Démocratie Socialiste Allemande devant l’histoire which came from the press in L ille in 1893.
It bore the follow- ing imprint (after the Preface and the Afterword): Conseil national du Parti ouvrier.

The miners’ strike at Carmaux (Southern Fr ance) which continued from mid-August to early November 1892.
The strike action was caused by the dismissal of one of the miners, Calvignac, the head of the local union, who had been elected to the pos t of town mayor.
The workers demanded that the managers of the mine revoke their decision and, this demand having been refused, went on strike.
This stoppage became political in character.
The governments arbitration actually sanctioned th e decision of the mine management.
The French Workers’ Party came out in support of the strike action; a country-wide fund- Die Neue Zeit, Bd.

Late in 1884 Bismarck, in a bid to intensify German y’s colonial policies, urge d the Reichstag to approve annual subsidies for steamship companies with the aim of organising regular voyages to East Asia, Australia and Africa.
This demand caused a split within the Social-Democratic faction in the Reichstag.
The Left wing with August Bebel and Wilhelm Liebkn echt at the head spoke out against support for the government’s demand.
The Right-wing majority in the faction (J.
H.
W Dietz, P.
Frohme, G.
Grillenberger) intended to vote for the subsidies on the pretext of furthering international ties.
The Right-wing stand was condemned by the party’s ra nk and file and its central organ, the newspaper Der Sozialdemokrat.
As a result, the majority of the faction wa s compelled to modify their attitude to the government motion during Reichsta g debates in March 1885 by maki ng its ‘yes’ votes conditional on passage by the Reichstag of some of the proposals of the faction (in pa rticular, the demand that ships for these lines be built only at German yards).
Only after these demands had been turned down by the Reichstag did all the members of the Social-Democratic faction vote against.

In his book Der Klassenkampf in der deutschen Sozialdemokratie (Zurich, 1892, p.

15- The Anti-Socialist Law (The Exceptional Law Against the Socialists) was introduced by the Bismarck government on a majority vote cast in the Reichsta g, on 21 October 1878 to combat the socialist and workers’ movement.
It banned all party and mass work ers’ organisations, and th e socialist and workers’ press, and sanctioned c onfiscation of socialist literature a nd persecution of Social-Democrats.
Nevertheless, the Social-Democratic Party, in acco rdance with Constitution preserved its group in the Reichstag.
Assisted by Marx and Engels, the Party was able to overcome both the reformist and anarchist tendencies within its ranks and e xpand its base among the popular masse s by a skilful combination of legal and illegal methods of wo rk.

Blanquists ( les blanquistes) —supporters of Louis A.
Blanqui who, after leaving the Workers’ Party {Le Parti français ouvrier, see Note 11), set up an organisation of their own, the Central Revolutionary Committee ( Comité Révolutionnaire Central) in 1880.
After Blanqui’s death in 1881, E.
Vaillant, E.
Eude s and E.
Granger came into the Committee’s leadership.
The Blanquists upheld the slogan of a general strike and advocated the inde- pendence of labour unions from the party.
They opted for political struggle at the expense of economic struggle.
During Boulangism (see Note 6) the Blanquists broke into two factions; one with Edouard Vaillant at the head came out against General Boulanger and thus made common cause with the Workers’ Party, while the other (E.
Granger, E.
Roche), having cooperated with the Boulangists, walked out of the Central Revolutionary Committee and fell apart soon after.
21.
Allemanists {les allemanistes) —supporters of the French socia list Jean Allemane.
After a split in the Possibilist Party (see No te 30), the Allemanists formed a Revolutionary-Socialist Workers’ Party {Le Parti ouvrier socialiste-révolutionnaire) in October 1890; this party existed up to 1905.
Considering economic st ruggle above the political one and opposing excessive parliamentarism, the Allemanists con centrated their efforts on propaganda work in labour unions {les syndicats) and assigned the political party of the proletariat but a secondary role.
A significant part of their activ ity was devoted to campaigns to win seats at municipal councils.

In keeping with the decision of the Second International Socialist Working Men’s Congress held in Brussels on 16-22 August 1891 (see Note 228), the worker and socialist organisa- tions of Switzerland, beginning January 1892, la unched preparations for the next congress due in Zurich in the summer of 1893.
They set up an Organising Committee which included representatives of the Social -Democratic Party, of the Grütli Union (founded in 1838 as an enlightenment alliance of artisans and workmen, it adhered to reformist positions) and of the trade-union amalgamation.
In Fe bruary 1892, the Organising Comm ittee issued an appeal to the working men of all lands saying that it be gan its activities and urging them to send in suggestions concerning the congress agenda.
28.
The Parliamentary Committee—the executive body of the Trades Union Congress of Great Britain that met in Manchester in 1868 a nd united the country’s unions.
As of 1871 the Parliamentary Committee was elected at annual congresses of the Britis h trades-unions and, in fact, was their steering body in between the congresses.
It nominated candidates to Parliament, supported draft bills tabled in the interests of the trades unions and worked to prepare regular trades-union congresses.
29.
Labour bourses {bourses du travail) was the name given in France to worker associations set up beginning with the latter half of the 1880s largely at the municipal councils of major towns and comprising representatives of various syndicats (labour unions).
Such bourses du travail were initially supported by government bodies and subsidised by them; thereby the government hoped to use these bourses as a ‘tool of social appeasement’ .
Yet the activity of the labour bourses (labour exch anges) engaged in job placem ent of the unemployed (each bourse had a special department in charge of that), in the organising of new syndicats in the Committee to which he intended to send the text of the resolution.

Engels refers to V.
Adler’s German translation of the first volume of the book by Sergei Kravchinsky (alias Stepniak) The Russian Peasantry.
Their Agrarian Condition, Social Life and Religion that was published in English in 1888 by Swan Sonnenschein & Co.
In his let- ter of 22 September 1892 Adler asked Engels to approach Stepniak so as to obtain formal permission from S.
Sonnenschein to publish the German translation of the book, and pay the royalties due to the author and the publisher.
Stepniak read the German edition and wrote a brief preface.
The book appeared in Stuttgart in 1893 under the title Der Russische Bauer (Dietz Publishers).

In his preface to Volume II I of Das Kapital (written in October 1894), Engels noted that Part V presented ‘the chief obstacle in prepar ing it for the press’ (Division of profit into interest and entrepreneural income.

Engels completed the bulk of this work in the spring of 1893 (see present edition, Vol.

Fabians —members of the Fabian Society founde d in 1884 by democratic-minded intellec- tuals.
It was named after the Roman general of 3d century B.
C.
, Quintus Fabias Maximus, surnamed Cunctator (‘the dela yer’) because of his cautious tactics in the war against Hannibal.
The Fabian Society included such prominent members as Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Bernard Shaw, H.
Bland, among others.
Its local organisations drew support from industrial workers who were attracted by a shar p critique of the capitalist order contained in Fabian publications.
However, except in 1892, when it attracted a number of otherwise ‘homeless’ working-class socialists, the number of actual ‘practising’ workers (i.
e.
, non- official trade-union members) never exceeded 10 per cent of the identifiable membership, and perhaps even less if the total numbers were counted.
Rejecting the possibility of a revolutionary transformation of bourgeois soci ety, the Fabians thought it was possible to shift from capitalism to socialism by implem enting reforms within the framework of so- called municipal socialism.
In 1900 the Fabian Society joined the Labour Party.
44.
Social Democratic Federation —a British socialist organisa tion set up in August 1884 on the basis of the bourgeois-radical Democratic Fede ration; it united heterogeneous socialist ele- ments, predominantly intellectuals and a section of politically active workers.
The Federation stated in its programme that the entire wealth of the nation should belong to Labour, its only source.
It also set as its aim a socialisation of the means of production, dis- tribution and exchange, and came out for a so ciety of ‘emancipated labour’.
That was Britain’s first socialist programme based main ly on Marxist ideas.
Th e leadership of the Federation was in the hands of Henry Hyndman, prone to authoritarian methods of guidance, and his supporters who did not deem it necessa ry to conduct work in the trades unions, a stance that inevitably led to isolation of the organisation from the working-class masses.
A group of Socialists within the Federation (El eanor Marx-Aveling, Edward Aveling, William Morris, Tom Mann and others) opposed Hyndman and championed closer ties with the working-class movement.
The differences on tactical issues and interna- weekly a daily publication.
Engels was watching closely the course of negotiations of which he had learned from Laura and Paul Lafa rgue.
Yet this plan did not come off.
49.
From 6 August to 24 December 1892 the German Social-Democratic newspaper Die Berliner Volks- Tribüne was publishing (in its supplement) a series of articles by the Swiss Socialist Louis Héritier under the general title ‘Die Juraföderation und Michael Bakunin; the author’s name was indicated only in the final article.
Proceeding from Bakuninist principles, the author gave a slanted picture of the histor y of the First International in Switzerland and vindicated the divisive activities of the Bakunini sts in particular, of the anarchist Jura Federation which, at its congress in La Ch aux-de-Fonds held between 4 and 6 April 1870, had broken away from the International secti ons in Roman Switzerland.
In addition, the articles contained numerous innuendoes about the activity of the General Council, Marx and his associates, specifically, about Johann Phili pp Becker.
Thus, it was claimed without any ground whatever that the London Conference of th e First International (1871) had been held in Marx’s house.
The tenth article, published on 12 November 1892, contained particularly numerous distortions.
Engels therefore decide d to speak out and refute the insinuations without waiting for the end of the series.
He se nt his statement, together with the present letter, to August Bebel for delivery to the editorial board of Die Berliner Volks-Tribüne.
The newspaper published Engels’ statement on 19 N ovember 1892 (see present edition, Vol.
27, pp.
344-46).
On 24 December 1892 L.
Héritier offered his reply, which was published together with his final article.
As in his le tter to Engels of 15 December 1892, Héritier tried to rebut the accusations.

On 14 November 1892 British Socialists held a rally in London’s Trafalgar Square to com- memorate the fifth anniversary of the ‘B loody Sunday’ of 13 November 1887, when a socialist meeting culminated in clashes w ith the police.
Several hundred demonstrators received injuries (three, fatal injuries), and some organisers were arrested.
Louise Kautsky’s account, which Engels men tions in his letter, was published without any title by Die Arbeiter Zeitung {no.

All the delegates, including those from Germ any, voted for this resolution, even though during the discussion on this issue the British and the German delegations had insisted on this action being held on the first Sunday of May.
The Be rlin Congress of the German Social-Democratic Party (see Note 51) passed a decision to celebrate May Day 1893 on the ev ening of May 1 and refrain from general work stoppages owing to the bad economic situation in the country.

In his address to the Berlin congress of the German Social-Democratic Party on 17 November 1892, A.
Bebel vindicated the proposal to hold 1893 May Day celebrations in Germany without staging work stoppages on May 1.
V.

An allusion to George Bernard Shaw’s letter to A.
Bebel of 29 May 1892 which Engels had copied.
This letter was published in a supplement to Volume 49 of the present edition, p.
563; in it Shaw pointed to the need of an alliance between the Socialists and the Liberals in the election campaign.
The only chance for the Socialists to win the election, he wrote to Bebel, was ‘to force th e Liberals to accept our men as their party candidates’.
According to Shaw, the Fabians were ‘compelled’ to force their candidates on the Liberals, or otherwise ‘at every election’ they would ‘suffer defeat and disgrace’.
In his letter to Kautsky on 4 September 1892, Engels analysed the Fabian electoral tactics and the causes of the defeat of the Fabian candidates on the Liberal list during the 1892 elections, (see present edition, Vol.
49, p.

Engels wrote this facetious letter in reply to the birthday greetings sent to him on behalf of the Secretariat of the Social-Democratic Pa rty of Germany by Ignaz Auer and Richard Fischer on 27 November 1892.
Jakob Bamberger made a postscript to the message and joined in the greetings on Engels’ 72nd birthday.

Apparently an allusion to Louise Kautsky’ s cooperation with the Vienna-published news- paper Arbeiterinnen-Zeitung.
In his letter to Laura Lafargue of 2 Octobe r 1891 (see present edition, Vol.
49, p.
251) on the forthcoming release of the newspaper’s first number, Engels described it ‘a hyaena paper’.
The epithet ‘hyaena is from Schiller’s poem The Song of the Bell m which the poet compares revolutionary women to hyenas.

It rallied under the banner of Catholicism the socially he terogenous strata of the clergy, the landed aristocracy, the bourgeoisie, that part of the peasantry predominantly in small and medium- sized states, as well as Roman Catholic working men in Western and South-Western Germany.
The Centrists, while being in opposition to the Bismarck government, voted nonetheless for its anti-labour and anti-Socialist enactments.
Engels gave a detailed analysis of the Centre in his work The Role of Force in History (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
453- 511) and in the article What’s Next? (see present edition, Vol.
27, pp.
7-11).
Since in 1893 the Centre Party had 196 seats in the Reichstag out of 397, it could play a decisive role in the event of differences among other parties.

In October 1890 Karl Liebknecht began a course in law at Berlin University.
He completed this course in March 1893 and, after passing an examination in October 1893, obtained the rank of a Referender (a low-rank official in Germany, us ually a lawyer, on probation at court of law or government office).

‘In Geldfragen hört die Gemütlichkeit auf (lite rally, ‘In money matters there is no room for sentiments’—’Where money begins, benevolen ce ends’).
Engels cites the phrase from a statement from one of the leaders of the Rhin eland liberal bourgeoisie and Prussian Finance Minister David Hansemann at a session of th e first United Landtag of Prussia on 8 June 1847.

The Ems dispatch—a report on the results of negotiations held between the Prussian King William I and the French Ambassador M.
Bene detti in the town of Ems concerning the candidacy of Prince Leopold Hohenzollern to the Spanish throne; this dispatch was sent to Bismarck on 13 July 1870.
William I declined th e demand of the French side that Prussia the war expenditures by raising taxes on consumer goods.
This elicited widespread discontent among the popular masses and with some bourgeoi s political parties as well.
On 6 May 1893 the Reichstag majority rejected the draft bill of the government.
The same day the Kaiser dissolved the Reichstag two years ahead of time.
After a new election, in June 1893, a similar draft law was e ndorsed by the Reichstag.
77.
Engels probably means the intention of W.
Gladst one’s Liberal Government in Britain to grant Home Rule for Ireland (see Note 171).
The decision to table a draft bill to this effect was largely due to conditions attending the formation of the Gladstone cab inet after parliamentary elections in the summer of 1892 when the Liberals could form the government onl y with the the backing of the Irish deputies.
The Home Rule Bill was introduced in February 1893 and, after heated debates and agitation throughout the spring and summer, was adopted by the Commons but turned down by the House of Lords, as had been the case in 1886.

This is in reply to Charles Bonnier’s letter to Engels of 2 December 1892 in which he protested against the decision of the Berlin Congress of the German So cial-Democratic Party (see Note 51) to refrain from work stoppages on 1 May 1893 and have May Day cel ebrations on the evening of the same day.

In a letter addressed to Engels on 2 December 1892 Charles Bonnier agreed that in Britain May Day celebrations were to be held on the first Sunday of May, as it had been in 1890 and 1891 (see also Engels’ article May 4 in London; present edition.

Th e Heinze Law, tabled in the Reichstag in 1891 and envisaging heavier penalties for pandering, pimpi ng and propagation of por nographic literature, was adopted after long debates only in 1900.
Speaking during the Heinze Law debates in the Re ichstag on 15 December 1892, A.

Engels means flagrant abuses in the activ ity of the Banca Romana which came to light dur- ing debates held in the Italian Parliament in December 1892-January 1893.
Implicated in these shady dealings were statesmen, MPs, lawyers, journalists and private individuals.
The scandalous affair came to be known as Panamino, a hint at the Panama Company fraud.
The debates were sparked off by a statement of one of the deputies, Napol eone Colajanni.
Engels responded by the article ‘The Italian Panama ’ (see present edition, Vol.

The editors of the present edition do not have at their disposal the original of Engels’ letter to Karl Henckell.
The phrase quoted here came from the notes on the poem ‘The Steam- King’ by E.

This edition wa s sponsored by the Social-Democratic group in the Reichstag.
In the course of his work K.
Henckell asked Engels on 2 November 1892 for verses and songs that could be included into the collection and also fo r the texts of his letters to be sent to the English poets Swinburne and W.
Morris.
E ngels must have responded favourably to Henckell’s request.
Besides the verses of Swinbur ne, Morris, Goethe, Heine, Schiller, Byron, Mickiewicz and the Russian poets Pushkin, Ry leyev and Nekrasov, the anthology included the poem ‘The Steam-King’ which Engels had tr anslated into German (see present edition, Vol.

The Independent Labour Party was founded by leaders of the new trades unions at the Bradford Conference on 13-14 January 1893 in a situation characterised by the mounting strike action and the movement for a greater sa y of the British working class in politics.
This party was headed by Keir Hardie.
In its programme the Independent Labour Party cham- pioned collective ownership of the means of production, an eight-hour day, prohibition of child labour, social insurance, unemploymen t allowances, among other demands.
The party leadership focused on parliamentary forms of struggle in its practical activities.
In 1900 the Independent Labour Party joined the Labour Party.

There was a welcome ceremony at Kronstadt in July 1891 for a French naval squadron to demonstrate a rapprochement between tsarist Russia and France.
The two countries, meanwhile, were holding diplomatic negotiations which, in August 1891, terminated in the signing of an agreement whereby France a nd Russia undertook the commitment to consult each other on foreign policy issues and to co me to terms on steps which both governments were to take in case of the threat of an a ttack on either.
Further talks led to the signing of the Bakunin trend as epitomised by the Jura Federation (see present edition, Vol.

In the 1885 parliamentary debates on the budget, the Irish MPs headed by Ch.
S.
Parnell, who were dissatisfied with the policy of the Gl adstone cabinet toward Ireland, joined hands with the Conservatives and forced the Gladstone government to resign.
The Salisbury Conservative Cabinet that came to power lasted only six months.
The parliamentary election of December 1885 gave no decisive margin to any of the contesting parties.
With the Liberals gaining a few more seats in Parliame nt, Gladstone was able to form a new cabinet, this time with the backing of the Irish deputies.
As the new cabinet head, Gladstone tabled two bills in 1886—on the Irish agrarian legisl ation and on Home Rule (see Note 171), both favourable to Ireland.
In the 1892 election Gladst one formed an allian ce with the Irish MPs again and, in 1893, tabled a second draft of the Home Rule; but neither the first nor the second bill succeeded.

Engels alludes to a three percent interest loan which France agr eed to grant Russia in September 1891 to a sum of 125 million gold roubl es (or 500 million francs).
The loan was a great success initially, with the sum of 125 m illion being surpassed se ven-and-a-half-fold during the subscription.
But then, because of th e dramatic fall in the rate of Russian secu- rities at European exchanges as a result of the 1891 famine in Russia and the country’s wors- ening economic situation, subscribers refuse d to accept the bonds.

The Congress made significant changes in the term s of the preliminary San Stefano Peace Treaty (of 3 March 1878) between Russia and Turkey which fortified Russia’s positions in the Balkans.

Engels means the sp eech of Franz Tutzauer, a Social-D emocrat, in the Reichstag on 21 January 1893 during the first reading of the dr aft law on enterprises selling their merchan- dise on an instalment plan (the text of the speech was published by the newspaper Vorwärts on 22 January 1893).
The speaker, who owned a small furniture-dealing shop, defended the rights of shop owners; in particular, their right to recover debts from defaulters, the working people as a rule.

Die Jungen (The Young Ones)—a semi-anarchist opposition group in German Social- Democracy formed in the spring and summer of 1890.
It was led by former university students: young literati and editors of party news papers (hence the name), as well as trade- union and party leaders from local organisations.
The oppositi on drew support from Social- Democratic Party members among industrial workers and craftsmen.
The leaders of the Young Ones were Paul Ernst, Paul Kamp ffmeyer, Hans Müller, Bruno Wille, Wilhelm Werner, Carl Wildberger and others.
Ignori ng the new realities obtained for the Party’s activity with the abrogation of the Anti-So cialist Law (see Note 15), the Young Ones opposed the Party’s parliamentary activities as not radical enough and were making dema- gogic attacks on the Party and its Executive Board {der Vorstand); thus, they accused it of political corruption, opportunism and violation of the Party democracy.
In October 1891 the leaders of the Young Ones were expelled from the Party.

In his letter to Engels on 5 January 1893 K.
Kautsky said he was going to write a detailed biography of Karl Marx for the forthcoming te nth anniversary of Marx’s death.
He was to proceed from the materials at his disposal—the article of Engels ‘Karl Marx’ (see present edition, Vol.

Engels means The Socialist League’s programme document— The Manifesto of the Socialist League (see The Commonweal No.
1, February 1885).
This organisation was founded in Britain in December 1885 by a group of Socialis ts who had left the Social Democratic Federation (see Note 44).
The Manifesto proclaimed in part that its members ‘.
.
.
seek a change in the basis of Society.
.
.
which would destroy the distinction of classes and nation- alities’.
The Socialist League pursued the following objectives: setting up a national and international socialist party; gaining political power by electing Socialists to local govern- ment bodies; assisting the trade-union and cooperative movements.
In the inital years of its existence the League was actively involved in the working-class movement, However, after 1887 its leadership split into several factions, and there surfaced strong sectarian tendencies, with many members leaving the ranks.
In 1895 th e Socialist League actually ceased to exist.

The Gazeta Robotnicza, which Maria Mendelson sent to Engels, carried a statement of Polish Social-Democrats about Marcin Kasprzak’s expulsion from the Party for the embez- zlement of Party funds, abuse of trust and susp icious links with the police.
Besides, the newspaper published a statement of Berlin So cialists who urged breaking off ties with Kasprzak.
Subsequently Marcin Kasprzak proved the slanderous nature of such accusations and took an active part in the revolutionary movement.
In 1905 the Central Committee of the Polish Social-Democratic Party adopted an offi cial decision clearing him from imputation.

Marx, from 6 to 8 signatures large.
Shmuilov asked Engels for assitance in collecting materials on three instalment).

In the course of the Reichstag delibera tions in late January 1893 on the state budget for 1893-94, the bourgeois depu ties hurled accusation at the Social-D emocrats to the effect that they allegedly wanted no more than foment popular discontent but were unable to say how they envisioned a socialist state of the futu re.
Responding in his two parliamentary speeches on 3 and 6 February 1893, August Bebel laid dow n the fundamental socialist principles.
He sought to capitalise on the widespread disc ontent and the inability of the imperial government to combat the gathering economic de pression.
For several days this issue was the subject of debates in the Reichstag, an occasion which the Social-Democratic deputies used to articulate their ideas.
Speaking on 7 Fe bruary, A.
Stoecker, representing the Right Wing, said that after W.
Liebknechts speech he would make no statement as he had originally intended and suggested that the debates be terminated.
The discussion ended therewith.

The French government had to bring to trial some of the men implicated in the Panama scandal (see Note 60).
On 9 February 1893, the court found Ferdinand-Marie Lesseps, the 88-year-old head of the comp any, guilty, and his son Charle s Lesseps, together with the other defendants, Fontacem Cottu and Fiffel.
F.

The Parish Councils Bill was tabled in Parliament by the Gladstone cabinet in 1893 and approved on 1 March 1894.
The entire system of local self-government was reorganised with this Bill.
The Parish councils, which had been performing the func tions of church and secular government in rural districts, now reta ined their prerogatives only in ecclesiastical affairs, while secular government was turned ove r to Parish Assemblies elected by local tax- payers.
In larger rural comm unities such assemblies elected Parish Councils from their midst.

A reference to the tug of war in the United States between the a dvocates of bimetallism and those of a single gold standard.
In 1890, under th e Sherman Silver Purchase Act, the West’s demands for more and more coinage of the me tal were heeded.
But as predicted, gold was hoarded and driven out of circ ulation, and the silver-to-gol d ration became 26.
5 : 1 in 1893.
In the summer of that year, under President Cleveland’s Administration, Congress had to repeal the Sherman Act to keep gold from va nishing altogether.
By the end of the 19th century gold was fully restored as a single cu rrency standard in the United States.
Engels gave his assessment of these developments in his letter to Sorge of 2 December 1893 (see this volume, pp.
235-36).

Yet fearing a possible confiscation of the booklet by the authorities, the editor pub- lished the Manifesto (in instalments), as a series of articles in the above newspaper.

This message, which Marx had written late in November 1864, was sent to Lincoln through the American Ambassador in London, Charles Francis Adams.
On 28 January 1865 the General Council received a reply sent on Lincoln’s behalf which was read out at the Council’s meeting of January 31 and then published by The Times (No.

Conservatives —a political party expressing the interest s of the Prussian Junkers, army cir- cles, top bureaucracy and Luther an clergy.
With the formati on of the North German Union and in the initial years of the German Empire , the Conservatives made a strong right-wing opposition to the Bismarck government; they came out against bourgeois reforms and broader powers conceded to the Reich author ities.
In 1866 there was a split in their ranks which gave rise to the Free Conservative Party {Die Freikonservative Partei, or Reichspartei) representing the interests of big landed propr ietors and of a segment of the industrial magnates.
The Free Conservatives took a stand of unequivocal support for the Bismarck government.
In 1876 the Conservatives made common cause with other right-wing groups and formed a German Conservative Party {Die Deutschkonservative Partei) which continued up to the year 1918.
203.
National Liberals —a Prussian (and from 1871, an a ll-German) bourgeois political party active between 1867 and 1918 as a bulwark of th e Junkers and industrial magnates.
This party expressed the interests of a larger pa rt of the big industrial and commercial bour geoisie, and also of the financiers—the stra ta that supported the domestic and foreign pol- 208.
At the elections to the French Chamber of Deputies on 20 August and 3 September 1893 the Socialists of various trends gained 700,000 votes and 30 seats (among the elected deputies 12 were from the Workers’ Party—J.
Gues de, J.
Juarés, E.
Vaillant and others).
The deputies representing the Workers’ Party agreed to form a united socialist group in the new Chamber; this group comprised 20 de puties who belonged to the bourgeois Left Wing, Radicals for the most part (also known as ‘independent socialists’) and other social- ists.
All in all the Socialist group in th e Chamber of Deputies numbered 50 deputies.
Engels more than once criticised the leadersh ip of the Workers’ Pa rty for concessions it had made to the Radicals in the matter of Pr ogramme and organisational principles for the sake of forming a joint Socialist parliamentary gr oup.

The second edition of Henry Lloyd’s book A Strike of Millionaires against Miners saw print in Chicago in 1891 (the first ed ition being published there in 1890).
This book looks into the history of a major loc kout staged by the owners of Illinois coal mines.
At the end of 1888 and in early 1889 the company fired a third of its coal miners and declared a general lockout; it closed stores selling foodstuffs on credit.
For nearly six months about five thousand mine rs were involved in a struggle to defend their rights.
Yet this standoff ended in a victory of the entr epreneurs who succeeded in imposing the lowest pay rates for miners in the United States by slashing the old ones 1/3.
The author had twice visited the scene and published a number of artic les in the press, urging assistance to the jobless coal miners and their families.

By anti-Semitic candidates, Engels means representatives of Die Christlich-soziale Arbeiterpartei (The Christian Social Worker Party) founded in 1878 by A dolf Stoecker, a reactionary German political figure and advocate of anti-Semitism.
This party saw its aim in combatting the socialist movement; subsequently it used the slogan of anti-Semitism to mount a dema gogic campaign against financial capital.
Its members succeeded in winning support among the backward strata of the peasantry and artisans in some districts of Germany; this success had a part to play in the se tup of the poll.
In 1895 A.
Stoecker transformed his organisation into Die Christlich-soziale Partei.

The reactionary French politicians P.
Dé roulède and L.

Clemenceau, the lead er of the Radical Party (see Note 86) in June 1893; they accused him of links with one of those implicated in the Panama affair (see Note 60) and of his being in the pay of the British governme nt.
The monarchist press started printing documents stolen from the British embassy which indicated breach of allegiance on Clemenceau’s part.
Yet these documents pr oved false upon their promulgation in the Chamber of Deputies.

In the spring of 1893 the monarc hist quarters of France, backed by the anarchists, launched a slanderous campaign against the Socialists; th ey branded as anti-patriotic the Socialist principle of internationalism.
In this connecti on J.
Geusde and P.
Lafargue organised meet- ings in towns of northern France on June 17 and 18 at which they read out an appeal to the working people of France (‘Le Conseil national du Parti ouvrier aux trav ailleurs de France’).
The appeal was published inthe newspaper Le Socialiste (No.
144) on 17 June 1893 on behalf of the National Council of the French Wo rkers’ Party.
Its full text reads as follows: TO THE WORKING PEOPLE OF FRANCE Comrades! In their impotent fury over the onward march of the Workers’ Party our class enemies have resorted to the only weapon left in their arsenal, slander.
They are distorting our inter- nationalism the way they have tried to distort our socialism.
And albeit those who seek to present us as having no Motherland are the selfsame people who, all through this century, have been but abetting incursions into Mo therland’s territory and dismemberment, a Motherland whom their class gave up to sack and plunder by the banditry of cosmopolitan financiers and whom it had b een exploiting without stopping at bloodshed at Ricamari and Fourmi, we, far from permitting them to confus e a collectivist solution to the question with anarchy, this mockery of bourgeois individualis m, shall never allow them to translate our glorious motto ‘Long Live the International!’ as the preposterous ventriloquy ‘Down with France!’ France was in the past, and she is de stined already now to evolve into one of the most significant factors of social advancement, as we understand it.
So, we want—and we cannot but want—to have a great and strong France capable of defending the republic against united monarchies, and also of protec ting her new year of 1789 which is to come against the coalition, at least against a possible co alition, of the capitalist states of Europe.
It is France who by the works of Babeuf, Four ier and Saint-Simon has made a beginning in the development of the socialist ideas to which Marx and Engels have imparted scientific consummation.
It is France, the country of the first bourgeois re volution, which is the inevitable precursor of a proletarian revolution, who became an epic battlefield of the classes a nd who sacrificed to the cause of emancipated labour a countless numbe r of her heroic rebels in Ly on in 1832 and Paris in 1848 and 1871.
It is France who, in spite of her sons having been butchered in the Versailles massacre, raised in 1889, at her immortal Congress in Paris, the banner of the International—a banner crimson with her own blood—and made a beginning in the celebration of May Day; she is the first to have hoisted the red banner of the proletariat, marching on toward winning political power, on the town halls seized by means of ballots.
And since her revolutionary past is the earnest of her socialist future, 23 years ago, as she faced danger, the internationalists of Italy, Spain and othe r countries rushed under the tricolor to her rescue, while the nascent German Social -Democracy, risking its freedom, did everything to prevent her dismemberment, just as absurd as criminal.
But this is why we, patriots, do not want a war whic h, be it victorious or not, would equally result in unspeakable calamities, leaving in the battlefield milli ons of people and the engines of death they will have been armed with.
We do not want a war which, whatever its outcome, would be but a game of Asiatic cruelty in the person of the Russian czar for the exhausted West.
We want peace, a lasting peace, because it is to our benefit but, is against the domination of the capitalists and governments, a domination we are out to destroy—for they can National Council: Joseph Crepin, Simon Dereure, Ferroul, deputy; Jules Geusde, Paul Lafargue, deputy; Prévost, Kennel.

The International Socialist Work ing-Men’s Congress in Paris, which was actually the constituent congress of the Second Internati onal, opened on 14 July 1889, the centennial of the storming of the Bastille.
About 400 delegates from 20 c ountries of Europe and America attended.
The Congress heard the reports of Socialist representatives on the condition of the working-class movement in their respective countries, outlined fundamental principles of the in ternational labour legisla tion by approving demands for the legal eight hours, prohibition of child labour and for labour protection of working women and adolescents.
The Congress stressed the need of a political organisation of the prol etariat and of a struggle for the implementation of workers’ democratic dema nds; it spoke out for a dissolution of regular armies which were to be replaced by a people’s militia.
Th e most significant decision of the Congress was its resolution on holding demonstrations and meetings in all countries on 1 May 1890 in support of an eight- hour working day and of a fair-labour code.
The an archists, who opposed the congress resolutions, failed to enlist support from the absolute majority of the delegates.
228.
The International Socialist Working-Men’s Congr ess in Brussels was held on 16-22 August 1891.
It was attended by 370 delegates from 16 Eur opean countries and the United States who represented, by and large, the Marxist trend in the working-class moveme nt.
Most of the delegates voted against anarchists participating in the Congress (w ho had sent their delegates).
A ttending the Congress were also representatives of the British trades unions, a rather positive factor according to Engels.
Such issues were on its agenda as the labour code, work stoppage a nd boycott, and militarism.
In its resolution on labour legislation the Congress called on work ers of the world to join forces in the struggle against the capitalist rule; it urged workers, wherever they had politi cal rights, to use thes e rights for their eman- Democrats and the position of Social-Democracy in the event of a war.
Since participation in the Congress was conditional on one’s rec ognition of political activity (something that the anarchists denied), the Congress began its work by considering the legitimacy of the mandates of the anarchist delegates.
Following a heated debate a resolution was carried by a majority of votes.
It interpreted the notion of political activity as the use of political rights and law-making institutions by wo rking-class parties in the inte rests of the proletariat and for gaining political power.
Upon the adoption of this amendment the anarchists, includ ing the representatives of The Young (see Note 129), had to leave the Congress.
On the issue of May Day festivities the Congre ss rejected by a majority of votes the pro- posal of the German Social-Democrats to have the celebrations as late as the first Sunday of the month; it stressed the major political significance of a demonstration on May 1 as the day of proletarian solidarity.
On the third issue of the agenda (t he political tactics of Social- Democrats) the Congress adopted a resolution which recognised the need of combining the parliamentary and non-pa rliamentary forms of struggle de pending on specific conditions in this or that country.
Concerning the attitude of Social-Democrats to war, the Congress turned down the Nieuwenhuis proposal for a general strike to be declared in case of a war and reaffirmed the basic provisions of the Brussels Congress reso lution on this issue (see Note 228); it added a clause urging workers to wage a disarmament struggle and obliging the Socialist MPs to vote against war credits.

The Belgian Workers’ Party was founded in Brussels on 5 April 1885 on the basis of the Belgian Socialist Party formed in 1879.
The Workers’ Party likewise comprised other work- ers’ organisations—trade unions, cooperatives , etc.
The Party crusaded for economic demands of the working class and for universal suffrage; it led the strike action of the proletariat.

The Duchy of Burgundy, formed in eastern France in th e 9th century, became an inde- pendent feudal state in the 14th and 15th centu ries; it attained maximum might under Duke Charles the Bold in the latter half of the 15th century.
In a bid to expand its dominions the Duchy of Burgundy worked against the centra list policy of the French King Louis XI and waged a war of conquest against the Swiss a nd Lorraine.
Finally Louis XI succeeded in having the Swiss and Lorrainians form a coa lition against Burgundy.
In a war against this coalition (1474-77) the troops of Charles the Bold were def eated, and the Duke was killed in the Battle of Nancy (1477).
His dominion was divided between Loui s XI and Maximilian Habsburg, the German Emperor’s son.

The other delegates were from non-Marxist parties and political groups: the Possibilists (see Note 30), the Independent Socialists (Jaclard), the Blanquists (see Note 20) [Degay and Rémy], etc.
The French delegation distinguished itself by its inconsistent voting and its opposition to Bebel’s theses and to the majority at the Congress.

Engels is answering Karl Kautsky’s letter of 20 September 1893 asking permission to publish Heinrich Heine’s letter to Marx of 21 September 1844 in Die Neue Zeit.
This letter was in the possession of Eleanor Marx-Aveling.
Kautsky asked Engels to wr ite an introduction to the intended publication, but Engels did not do so.
The Heine letter was published in Die Neue Zeit (No.
1, 1895-96, Vol.

A reference to the draft electoral reform tabl ed in the Austrian Reichskrat on 10 October 1893 by Ministerpräsident (Premier) Eduard Taaffe whose govern ment represented the conservative bloc of the big landed proprietors and top bureaucracy.
He was suppor ted by the Polish, Czech and Slovenian feudal- clerical interests, A broad campaign for a reform of the country’s electoral system began in the early 1890s.
On 9 July 1893 Social-Democrats organised a mammoth demonstration of Vienna’s workers for universal suffrage.
Similar demonstrations and rallies were held countrywide.
Under the circumstances the Taaffe government proposed a draft electoral reform which provided for a considerably wider range of prospective voters, but preserved the old curial sy stem and the privileges for the landlords and the bourgeoisie.
The reactionary political parties, however, opposed the draft law, and the Taaffe cabinet had to resign in October 1893.
The country’s electoral system was reformed as late as 1896.

The Social-Democratic Workers’ Party of Aust ria was founded at a unification congress that was in session at Heinfeld (Low Austria) on 30 Decem ber 1888—1 January 1889.
Th is congress adopted a programme (‘Declaration of Principles’) which was ba sed on the fundamental tenets of Marxism.
In its Declaration the Party defined as its objective a politi cal organisation of the pr oletariat; it pledged to promote the class-consciousness of the proletariat.
Its other targets incl uded socialisation of the means of production, emancipation of Labour, political right s for working people and their education.

Der Sonderbund- —a separatist union of the se ven economicallly backward Catholic cantons formed in 1843 to resist progressive bourgeois reforms and to defend the privilege s of the Church and the Jesuits.
The decree of the Swiss Diet of 1847 dissolving the S onderbund served as a pretext for the latter to start hostilities against other cantons early in Novemb er.
On 23 November 1847, the Sonderbund forces, consisting largely of milita detachments, were defeated by the federalist army.

In view of the Socialists’ success at the elections to the French Chamber of Deputies in August-September 1893 (see Note 208), the reacti onary press mounted a campaign of slan- der accusing them of being German agents on th e pretext that German Social-Democrats had donated 2,500 francs to the election fund.
In this connection P.
Lafargue wrote to Engels on 5 September 1893 that French Socialists had be tter not receive money from Germany in the future.

Engels means a congress held by the Soci al-Democratic Party of Germany in Cologne on 22-28 October 1893.
The congress heard the repor ts of the Party Execu tive of the Social- Democratic group in the Reichstag, and disc ussed the Party press, the labour union move- ment and its support by the Social-Democrats, May Day celebrations in 1894, as well as August Bebel’s report Antisemitismus und Sozi aldemokratie’.
The delegates came out against Social-Democrats taking part in the el ection to the Prussian Landtag and against any compromises with the bourgeois parties.
280.
On 10 October 1893 P.
Lafargue wrote to Enge ls about the plan to start a newspaper that could enable the Workers’ Party to rise to a leading position in the French Socialist press.
Here Engels recalls that in 1892 Le Socialiste had announced that it would be a daily news- paper as of October 1892; the announcement began with the words ‘pour paraître en Octobre’ (‘to appear in October’).
In actual fact, Le Socialiste continued as a weekly.

Engels had the fee for his works printed by the Dietz Publishers in Stuttgart sent to V.
Adler for the needs of Austri an Social-Democracy.
At about the same time there was a strike of Be lgian miners who demanded a 10 per cent wage rise.
This strike, which ended in mid-Octobe r, also fell short of its objectives.
286.
In the summer of 1893, after the announcement of a lockout in the British mining industry (see this volume, pp.
204-05), the employers tried to use strike breakers.
On 7 September 1893, as there was unrest among the miners of Featherstone (Yorkshire), th e mine owners called in troops who opened fire, wounding several people.
Thereupon nearly all the co al districts were overrun by government troops, a move that caused outrage countrywide.
As a result, the employers had to refrain from introducing lower pay rates for the time being.

Engels sketched the dr aft of his reply to Ferdinand Wolff on th e reverse side of Wolff’s letter received late in October 1893 and containing innuendoes and threats against Engels .
Ignorant as he was of Wolff’s mental illness, Engels wrote a letter of reply, but it is not known whether it was ever sent.
Visiting Wolff shortly afterwards, Engels could see at first hand his grave condition.

Karl Kautsky asked Eduard Bernstein to write an article on the general strike for publication in Die Neue Zeit, he hoped this would start a discussion on the subject .

A reference to the controversy over the McKinley protectionist tariff a dopted in November 1890 (William McKinley was one of the leaders of the Republican Party [and President of the United States in 1897-1901]).
The new tariff provided for a dramatic rise in duties on merchandise imported to the United States and, as a consequence, sent consumer prices up.
The situation of the worrking class deteriorat ed as a result.
The tariff bill invested the President with the right to in crease import duties in the future as well.

The new cabinet, head ed by Jean Casimir-Périer, ran into major difficulties at the very outset as Jean Juarès, sp eaking in a debate on the tax reform, tabled a motion whereby small farms were to be tax ex empt.
This proposal, made on behalf of the socialist parliamentary group, was carried by a majority of votes; however, Casimir-Périer annulled the results of voting to prevent a fall of the new cabinet.

On 5 January 1894 Die Arbeiter-Zeitung (No.
9) carried the article ‘Das allgemeine Wahlrecht eine “konservative Maßregel’”; cited in this article was a passage from K.
Kautsky’s article ‘Ein sozialdemokratischer Katechismus’ published in December 1893 by Die Neue Zeit (Bd.
I, NN 12 and 13, 1893-1894).
The publication in Die Arbeiter-Zeitung proved the inadequacy and harm of a general political strike in the struggle for electoral reform.
322.
The first c ongress of the Austrian trade unions, he ld in Vienna from 24 to 27 December 1893, set up a single centralised organisation and endorsed a single strike statute for all the unions.
The congress spoke out against a general st rike as a tool in the struggle for universal suffrage.
The Czech Social-Democrats held thei r congress on 24-26 December 1893 in Budweis (the present name, Ceské Budejovice).
It passed a decision on forming a Czechoslavonian Social-Democratic Party [Ceskoslovanská Sociál ne domekraticka strana] on the basis of the principles proclaimed by the Unification C ongress of the Austrian Social-Democrats at Heinfeld in 1888 (see Note 272).
The proceedings of the congresses held by the Austrian trade unions and the Czech Social-Democrats were covered by Die Arbeiter-Zeitung (NN 1 and 2) on 2 and 5 January 1894.
323.
The fourth Congress of the Social-Democratic Party of Austria was held in Vienna on 25- 31 March 1894.
The Congress passed a resolution stating that the Austrian workers intended to campaign for universal suffrage us ing all available means, including a general strike.
The congress also adopted new Party Rule s and resolved to continue with the annual May Day celebrations by holding demonstrations for an 8-hour day, universal suffrage and in support of international br otherhood among all working people.

As R.
Fischer wrote in his letter of 27 January 1894, Reuß had voiced protes t over this article and denied any connection between his departure from The Daily Chronicle and the exposures in Vorwärts.
On 14 January 1894, Fischer also asked Engels if he remembered a second publication on Reuß in Vorwärts .
331.
The Erfurt Congress of the German Social -Democratic Party took place on 14 to 20 October 1891.
Among the other issues, the Congress discussed and adopted a new Party Programme which, despite some shortcomings, was essentially based on Marxist principles.
The critic ism of the original draft of the Programme, which Engels made in his work A Critique of the Draft of the Social-Democratic Programme of 1891’ (see present edition, Vol.
27), applies in pa rt to the adopted Programme.
The decisions of the Erfurt Congress sealed the Marxist tre nd in Germany’s working-class movement.

The Congress of the Socialist Workers’ Party of Germany in Wyden (Switzerland) was held in August 1890.
That was the first illegal congress of the Germ an Social-Democrats following the introduction of the Anti-Socialist Law of 1878 (see Note 15).
The Congr ess criticised the anarchist stand of Johann Most and Wilhelm Hasselmann, who rejected all legal m eans of struggle, advocated individual terror and launched an open campaign against the Party l eadership; it expelled them from the Party.
The Congress unanimously decided to strike out the word ‘legal’ from the statement contained in Part II of the Gotha Programme of 1875 to the effect that the Party was working to attain its goals ‘with all legal means’.
The Congress confirmed the status of Der Sozialdemokrat as the Party’s official organ.
344.
As August Momberger wrote to Engels on 26 Februa ry 1894, he wanted to take part in disseminating socialist ideas among foreigners resident in Wiesbaden, the English in the first place.
He asked Engels to recommend the significant socialist, socio-political and natural science works, as well as some English journal similar to the German Die Neue Zeit.

Engels means the articles published anonymously by Der Arbeiter-Zeitung (Nos.
19-22) on 6, 13 and 16 March 1894; apparently they were written by Victor Adle r.
The article that Engels refers to appeared on 6 March 1894, likewise without a signature; it was entitled ‘Die Wahlreform Stadnicki’.
It criticised the draft of an electoral reform suggested by the co alition government of Alfred von Windischgrätz.
The bill envisaged only an insignificant increase in the Reic hstag representation by setting up a fifth curia.

In her letter of 11 April 1894 Laura Lafargue to ld Engels that the Fren ch anarchists (liber- taires) were out to publish one of the works of Eugen Dühring.
In this connection Bonnet, the secretary of the Editorial Board of the journal L’Ere nouvelle, suggested that a transla- tion into French of Engels’ work Anti-Dühring should be begun without de lay so as to have it ready before the appearance of Dühring’s book.
Such a translation did not materialise at the time.
356.
Speaking in the Reichstag on 7 April 1894, Earl von Kanitz proposed a state monopoly of grain imports and exports; the state was likewise to fix grain prices.
The Social-Democrats voted against; on 14 July 1894 the motion was rejected by 159 votes against 49.

358.
The English translation of Marx’s Speech on the Question of Free Trade was published in Boston in 1888; it was prefaced by an introduction (Free Trade) written by Engels; it was published in Boston and London in 1889.
The Ita lian translation of Marx’s speech was pub- lished in La Critica Sociale (Nos.
7 and 8) on 1 and 16 April 1894; the same periodical car- ried Engels’ introduction on 1 and 16 May and 1 June 1894 (Nos.

Boris Krichevsky, a Russian emigré Socialist, had sent Engels the Russian translations of Marx’s works The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte and Wage Labour and Capital with Engels’ introduction to the 1891 edition (see pr esent edition, Vols.
11,9,26); both works, published in Geneva in 1894 in the series Social-Democratic Library, were translated into Russian by Krichevsky.
He told Engels in his letter that the same publishers undertook the printing of Engels’ article ‘On Social Relations in Russia’ (in the series of his articles Refugee Literature) [see present edition, Vol.
24] .
Krichevsky asked Engels to write a preface to the Russian edition of the above article.
However, the printing was stopped because of protest from Engels who had earlier given Vera Zasulic h the copyright.
This article appeared in V Zasulich’s translation in The Library of Contemporary Socialism (Geneva, 1894) under the title ‘Friedrich Engels on Russia.

Using the anarchist acts of terror as a pretext, th e French government enacted la ws against anarchists, the vague wording of which made it possible to apply them against Socialists as well.
The first enactment was endorsed in December 1893 after August Vaillant had th rown a bomb in the French Chamber of Deputies (see Note 309); the second enactment was approved at the end of July 1894 af ter the assassination of President Carnot by the Italian anarchist Caseri o (see Note 378), against heavy resistance from the Socialists and some of the Radicals.
These two bills imposed restrictions on freedom of the press and provided for special courts to handle cases of violation of the laws on the press.

At the request of Pablo Iglesias, Engels wrote the appeal ‘To the English Socialist and Working Men’s Organisations’ (see present edition, Vol.
27) in wh ich he gave notice of th e forthcoming 4th annual Congress of the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party.
He se nt similar appeals also to the Social-Democrats of Austria and Germany.
The Fourth Congress of the Spanish Socialist Work ers’ Party took place in Madrid from 29 August to 1 September 1894.
The Congress heard reports of the Party’s National C ouncil and of a delegate who had attended the International Socialis t Working-Men’s Congress in Zurich (held in 1893, see Note 229); it discussed the issue of the Party press and adopted the new Party Rules.

It was formed in late March-early Ap ril 1889 under the conditions of a mounting strike movement.
A major contributi on to the foundation and work of the union was made by Eleanor Marx-Aveling and Edward Aveling.
The Un ion campaigned for the legal eight hours.
It gained considerable influence within a short span of tim e; as many as 100,000 gas works employees joined it within a year.

Engels probably refers to the speeches made at the Zurich International Socialist Working-Men’s Congress (see Note 229) by some members of the Fr ench delegation who levele d sharp criticism at the parliamentary activity of Socialists and put forward the idea of social revolution by means of a general strike.
Among the members of the French delegati on was Paul Arndt, a Paris correspondent of the newspaper Vorwärts.

Engels means the Exceptional Law on Public Secur ity passed by the Italian Parliament on 14 July 1894.
This law, enacted with the aim of combatting the an archists, was used by the Crispi government against the working-class movement and Socialists as well.
It banned the Socialist Party of the Italian Working People (Il Partito Socialista dei lavoratori italiani), closed worker organisations and worker periodicals; arbitrary arrests, searches and trials assumed mass proportions.
All this notwithstanding, the Italian Socialists kept up their struggle and, in January 1895, they convened in Parma illegally for a third congress of their party.

In October 1894 Pablo Iglesias was sentenced to a fo rty-day term in prison for leading a strike action of Malaga textile workers.
This strike broke out in the first half of October 1894 at the textile mills of Marquis Larios in protest over the decision of the en trepreneurs to disband the Textile Workers’ Union and punish 19 workers active in it.
