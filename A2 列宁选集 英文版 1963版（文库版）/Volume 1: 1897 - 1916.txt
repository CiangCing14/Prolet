Lenin wrote this article for the Encyclopaedia
    Dictionary published by the Granat Brothers, which was then the most popular
    in Russia. In the preface for the pamphlet edition in 1918 Lenin gave the
    date of writing as 1913, from memory. Actually, he began it in the spring of
    1914 in Poronin, but had to interrupt it, being too busy with his work
    guiding the Party and the newspaper Pravda. Lenin resumed his work
    on the aritcle only in September that year, after he had moved to Berne, and
    finished it in the first half of November.
The aritcle was published in 1915 in Volume 28 of the
    Dictionary with Bibliography of Marxism appended to it; it
    was signed V. Ilyin. For censorship reasons, the editors omitted
    two chapters: Socialism and Tactics of the Class Struggle of
    the Proletariat and made a number of changes in the text.
In 1918, the Priboi Publishers put out the article in
    pamphlet form exactly as published in the Dictionary but without
    the “Bibliography.”
The full text of the article according to the manuscript was
    first published by the Lenin Institute of the C.P.S.U. Central Committee in
    the collection of Lenin’s articles Marx, Engels, Marxism,
    which appeared in 1925.

Note that this document has undergone special formating to ensure that 
Lenin’s sidenotes fit on the page, marking as best as possible 
where they were located in the original manuscript.

  This article was published in 1913 in Prosveshcheniye No. 3,
  dedicated to the Thirtieth Anniversary of Marx’s death.

Prosveshcheniye (Enlightenment) was a Bolshevik
  social, political and literary monthly published legally in St. Petersburg
  from December 1911 onwards. Its inauguration was proposed by Lenin to
  replace the Bolshevik journal Mysl (Thought), a Moscow
  publication banned by the tsarist government. Lenin directed the work of
  the journal from abroad and wrote the following articles for it:
  “Fundamental Problems of the Election Campaign”, 
  “Results of the Election”, “Critical Remarks on the 
  National Question”, “The Right of
  Nations to Self-Determination”, and others.

  The journal was suppressed by the tsarist government in June
  1914, on the eve of the First World War. Publication was resumed in the
  autumn of 1917 but only one double number appeared; this number contained
  two articles by Lenin: “Can the Bolsheviks Retain State Power?” and “A
  Review of the Party Programme”.


Throughout the civilised world the teachings of Marx evoke
the utmost hostility and hatred of all bourgeois science (both official and
liberal), which regards Marxism as a kind of “pernicious sect”. And no
other attitude is to be expected, for there can be no “impartial” social
science in a society based on class struggle. In one way or another,
all official and liberal science defends wage-slavery,
whereas Marxism has declared relentless war on that slavery. To expect
science to be impartial in a wage-slave society is as foolishly naïve as
to expect impartiality from manufacturers on the question of whether
workers’ wages ought not to be increased by decreasing the profits of
capital.

But this is not all. The history of philosophy and the history of
social science show with perfect clarity that there is nothing resembling
“sectarianism” in Marxism, in the sense of its being a hidebound,
petrified doctrine, a doctrine which arose away from the high road
of the development of world civilisation. On the contrary, the genius of
Marx consists precisely in his having furnished answers to questions
already raised by the foremost minds of mankind. His doctrine emerged as
the direct and immediate continuation of the teachings of the
greatest representatives of philosophy, political economy and socialism.

The Marxist doctrine is omnipotent because it is true. It is
comprehensive and harmonious, and provides men with an integral world
outlook irreconcilable with any form of superstition, reaction, or defence
of bourgeois oppression. It is the legitimate successor to the best that
man produced in the nineteenth century, as represented by German

 

philosophy, English political economy and French socialism.

It is these three sources of Marxism, which are also its component
parts that we shall outline in brief.
I

The philosophy of Marxism is materialism. Throughout the
modern history of Europe, and especially at the end of the eighteenth
century in France, where a resolute struggle was conducted against every
kind of medieval rubbish, against serfdom in institutions and ideas,
materialism has proved to be the only philosophy that is consistent, true
to all the teachings of natural science and hostile to superstition, cant
and so forth. The enemies of democracy have, therefore, always exerted all
their efforts to “refute”, under mine and defame materialism, and have
advocated various forms of philosophical idealism, which always, in one way
or another, amounts to the defence or support of religion.

Marx and Engels defended philosophical materialism in the most
determined manner and repeatedly explained how profoundly erroneous is
every deviation from this basis. Their views are most clearly and fully
expounded in the works of Engels, Ludwig Feuerbach and
Anti-Dühring, which, like the Communist Manifesto, are
handbooks for every class-conscious worker.

But Marx did not stop at eighteenth-century materialism:
he developed philosophy to a higher level, he enriched it with the
achievements of German classical philosophy, especially of Hegel’s system,
which in its turn had led to the materialism of Feuerbach. The main
achievement was dialectics, i.e., the doctrine of development in
its fullest, deepest and most comprehensive form, the doctrine of the
relativity of the human knowledge that provides us with a reflection of
eternally developing matter. The latest discoveries of natural
science—radium, electrons, the transmutation of elements—have been a
remarkable confirmation of Marx’s dialectical materialism despite the
teachings of the bourgeois philosophers with their “new” reversions to
old and decadent idealism.


Marx deepened and developed philosophical materialism to the full, and
extended the cognition of nature to include the cognition of human
society. His historical materialism was a great achievement
in scientific thinking. The chaos and arbitrariness that had previously
reigned in views on history and politics were replaced by a strikingly
integral and harmonious scientific theory, which shows how, in consequence
of the growth of productive forces, out of one system of social life
another and higher system develops—how capitalism, for instance, grows
out of feudalism.  

Just as man’s knowledge reflects nature (i.e., developing matter),
which exists independently of him, so man’s social knowledge
(i.e., his various views and doctrines—philosophical, religious,
political and so forth) reflects the economic system of
society. Political institutions are a superstructure on the economic
foundation. We see, for example, that the various political forms of the
modern European states serve to strengthen the domination of the
bourgeoisie over the proletariat.  

Marx’s philosophy is a consummate philosophical materialism which has
provided mankind, and especially the working class, with powerful
instruments of knowledge.  
II

Having recognised that the economic system is the foundation on which
the political superstructure is erected, Marx devoted his greatest
attention to the study of this economic system. Marx’s principal work,
Capital, is devoted to a study of the economic system of modern,
i.e., capitalist, society.  

Classical political economy, before Marx, evolved in England, the most
developed of the capitalist countries. Adam Smith and David Ricardo, by
their investigations of the economic system, laid the foundations of the
labour theory of value. Marx continued their work; he provided a
proof of the theory and developed it consistently. He showed that the value
of every commodity is determined by the quantity of socially necessary
labour time spent on its production.  


Where the bourgeois economists saw a relation between things (the
exchange of one commodity for another) Marx revealed a relation between
people. The exchange of commodities expresses the connection between
individual producers through the market. Money signifies that the
connection is becoming closer and closer, inseparably uniting the entire
economic life of the individual producers into one whole. Capital
signifies a further development of this connection: man’s labour-power
becomes a commodity. The wage-worker sells his labour-power to the owner of
land, factories and instruments of labour. The worker spends one part of
the day covering the cost of maintaining himself and his family (wages),
while the other part of the day he works without remuneration, creating for
the capitalist surplus-value, the source of profit, the source of
the wealth of the capitalist class.  

The doctrine of surplus-value is the corner-stone of Marx’s economic
theory.  

Capital, created by the labour of the worker, crushes the worker,
ruining small proprietors and creating an army of unemployed. In industry,
the victory of large-scale production is immediately apparent, but the same
phenomenon is also to be observed in agriculture, where the superiority of
large-scale capitalist agriculture is enhanced, the use of machinery
increases and the peasant economy, trapped by money-capital, declines and
falls into ruin under the burden of its backward technique. The decline of
small-scale production assumes different forms in agriculture, but the
decline itself is an indisputable fact.  

By destroying small-scale production, capital leads to an increase in
productivity of labour and to the creation of a monopoly position for the
associations of big capitalists. Production itself becomes more and more
social—hundreds of thousands and millions of workers become bound
together in a regular economic organism—but the product of this
collective labour is appropriated by a handful of capitalists. Anarchy of
production, crises, the furious chase after markets and the insecurity of
existence of the mass of the population are intensified.  

By increasing the dependence of the workers on capital, the capitalist
system creates the great power of united labour.  


Marx traced the development of capitalism from embryonic commodity
economy, from simple exchange, to its highest forms, to large-scale
production.  

And the experience of all capitalist countries, old and new, year by
year demonstrates clearly the truth of this Marxian doctrine to increasing
numbers of workers.  

Capitalism has triumphed all over the world, but this triumph is only
the prelude to the triumph of labour over capital.  
III

When feudalism was overthrown and “free” capitalist society
appeared in the world, it at once became apparent that this freedom meant a
new system of oppression and exploitation of the working people. Various
socialist doctrines immediately emerged as a reflection of and protest
against this oppression. Early socialism, however, was utopian
socialism. It criticised capitalist society, it condemned and damned it, it
dreamed of its destruction, it had visions of a better order and
endeavoured to convince the rich of the immorality of exploitation.  

But utopian socialism could not indicate the real solution. It could
not explain the real nature of wage-slavery under capitalism, it could not
reveal the laws of capitalist development, or show what social
force is capable of becoming the creator of a new society.  

Meanwhile, the stormy revolutions which everywhere in Europe, and
especially in France, accompanied the fall of feudalism, of serfdom, more
and more clearly revealed the struggle of classes as the basis and
the driving force of all development.  

Not a single victory of political freedom over the feudal class was won
except against desperate resistance. Not a single capitalist country
evolved on a more or less free and democratic basis except by a
life-and-death struggle between the various classes of capitalist society.

The genius of Marx lies in his having been the first to deduce from
this the lesson world history teaches and to apply that lesson
consistently. The deduction he made is the doctrine of the class
struggle.  


People always have been the foolish victims of deception and
self-deception in politics, and they always will be until they have learnt
to seek out the interests of some class or other behind all moral,
religious, political and social phrases, declarations and
promises. Champions of reforms and improvements will always be fooled by
the defenders of the old order until they realise that every old
institution, how ever barbarous and rotten it may appear to be, is kept
going by the forces of certain ruling classes. And there is only
one way of smashing the resistance of those classes, and that is to
find, in the very society which surrounds us, the forces which can—and,
owing to their social position, must—constitute the power capable of
sweeping away the old and creating the new, and to enlighten and organise
those forces for the struggle.  

Marx’s philosophical materialism alone has shown the proletariat the
way out of the spiritual slavery in which all oppressed classes have
hitherto languished. Marx’s economic theory alone has explained the true
position of the proletariat in the general system of capitalism.  

Independent organisations of the proletariat are multi plying all over
the world, from America to Japan and from Sweden to South Africa. The
proletariat is becoming enlightened and educated by waging its class
struggle; it is ridding itself of the prejudices of bourgeois society; it
is rallying its ranks ever more closely and is learning to gauge the
measure of its successes; it is steeling its forces and is growing
irresistibly.

There is a well-known saying that if geometrical axioms
affected human interests attempts would certainly be made to refute
them. Theories of natural history which conflicted with the old prejudices
of theology provoked, and still provoke, the most rabid opposition. No
wonder, therefore, that the Marxian doctrine, which directly serves to
enlighten and organise the advanced class in modern society, indicates the
tasks facing this class and demonstrates the inevitable replacement (by
virtue of economic development) of the present system by a new order—no
wonder that this doctrine has had to fight for every step forward in the
course of its life.  

Needless to say, this applies to bourgeois science and philosophy,
officially taught by official professors in order to befuddle the rising
generation of the propertied classes and to “coach” it against internal
and foreign enemies. This science will not even hear of Marxism, declaring
that it has been refuted and annihilated. Marx is attacked with equal zest
by young scholars who are making a career by refuting socialism, and by
decrepit elders who are preserving the tradition of all kinds of outworn
“systems”. The progress of Marxism, the fact that its ideas are spreading
and taking firm hold among the working class, inevitably increase the
frequency and intensity of these bourgeois attacks on Marxism, which
becomes stronger, more hardened and more vigorous every time it is
“annihilated” by official science.  

But even among doctrines connected with the struggle of the working
class, and current mainly among the proletariat, Marxism by no means
consolidated its position all at once. In the first half-century of its
existence (from

    

the 1840s on) Marxism was engaged in combating theories fundamentally
hostile to it. In the early forties Marx and Engels settled accounts with
the radical Young Hegelians whose viewpoint was that of philosophical
idealism. At the end of the forties the struggle began in the field of
economic doctrine, against Proudhonism. The fifties saw the completion of
this struggle in criticism of the parties and doctrines which manifested
themselves in the stormy year of 1848. In the sixties the struggle shifted
from the field of general theory to one closer to the direct labour
movement: the ejection of Bakuninism from the International. In the early
seventies the stage in Germany was occupied for a short while by the
Proudhonist Mühlberger, and in the late seventies by the positivist
Dühring. But the influence of both on the proletariat was already
absolutely insignificant. Marxism was already gaining an unquestionable
victory over all other ideologies in the labour movement.  

By the nineties this victory was in the main completed. Even in the
Latin countries, where the traditions of Proudhonism held their ground
longest of all, the workers’ parties in effect built their programmes and
their tactics on Marxist foundations. The revived international
organisation of the labour movement—in the shape of periodical
international congresses—from the outset, and almost without a struggle,
adopted the Marxist standpoint in all essentials. But after Marxism had
ousted all the more or less integral doctrines hostile to it, the
tendencies expressed in those doctrines began to seek other channels. The
forms and causes of the struggle changed, but the struggle continued. And
the second half-century of the existence of Marxism began (in the nineties)
with the struggle of a trend hostile to Marxism within Marxism itself.


Bernstein, a one-time orthodox Marxist, gave his name to this trend by
coming forward with the most noise and with the most purposeful expression
of amendments to Marx, revision of Marx, revisionism. Even in Russia
where—owing to the economic backwardness of the country and the
preponderance of a peasant population weighed down by the relics of
serfdom—non-Marxist socialism has naturally held its ground longest of
all, it is plainly passing into

    

revisionism before our very eyes. Both in the agrarian question (the
programme of the municipalisation of all land) and in general questions of
programme and tactics, our Social-Narodniks are more and more substituting
“amendments” to Marx for the moribund and obsolescent remnants of their
old system, which in its own way was integral and fundamentally hostile to
Marxism.  

Pre-Marxist socialism has been defeated. It is continuing the struggle,
no longer on its own independent ground, but on the general ground of
Marxism, as revisionism. Let us, then, examine the ideological content of
revisionism.  

In the sphere of philosophy revisionism followed in the wake of
bourgeois professorial “science”. The professors went “back to
Kant"—and revisionism dragged along after the neo-Kantians. The
professors repeated the platitudes that priests have uttered a thousand
times against philosophical materialism—and the revisionists, smiling
indulgently, mumbled (word for word after the latest Handbuch)
that materialism had been “refuted” long ago. The professors treated
Hegel as a

“dead dog”,[2] and while themselves preaching idealism, only an
idealism a thousand times more petty and banal than Hegel’s,
contemptuously shrugged their shoulders at dialectics—and the
revisionists floundered after them into the swamp of philosophical
vulgarisation of science, replacing “artful” (and revolutionary)
dialectics by “simple" (and tranquil) “evolution”. The professors earned
their official salaries by adjusting both their idealist and their
“critical” systems to the dominant medieval “philosophy” (i.e., to
theology)—and the revisionists drew close to them, trying to make
religion a “private affair”, not in relation to the modern state, but in
relation to the party of the advanced class.  

What such “amendments” to Marx really meant in class terms need not
be stated: it is self-evident. We shall simply note that the only Marxist
in the international Social-Democratic movement to criticise the incredible
platitudes of the revisionists from the standpoint of consistent
dialectical materialism was Plekhanov. This must be stressed. all the more
emphatically since profoundly mistaken attempts are being made at the
present time to smuggle in

    

old and reactionary philosophical rubbish disguised as a criticism of
Plekhanov’s tactical

     opportunism.[1]


Passing to political economy, it must be noted first of all that in
this sphere the “amendments” of the revisionists were much more
comprehensive and circumstantial; attempts were made to influence the
public by “new data on economic development”. It was said that
concentration and the ousting of small-scale production by large-scale
production do not occur in agriculture at all, while they proceed very
slowly in commerce and industry. It was said that crises had now become
rarer and weaker, and that cartels and trusts would probably enable capital
to eliminate them altogether. It was said that the “theory of collapse”
to which capitalism is heading was unsound, owing to the tendency of class
antagonisms to become milder and less acute. It was said, finally, that it
would not be amiss to correct Marx’s theory of value, too, in
accordance with

Böhm-Bawerk.[3] 

The fight against the revisionists on these questions resulted in as
fruitful a revival of the theoretical thought in international socialism as
did Engels’s controversy with Dühring twenty years earlier. The
arguments of the revisionists were analysed with the help of facts and
figures. It was proved that the revisionists were systematically painting a
rose-coloured picture of modern small-scale production. The technical and
commercial superiority of large-scale production over small-scale
production not only in industry, but also in agriculture, is proved by
irrefutable facts. But commodity production is far less developed in
agriculture, and modern statisticians and economists are, as a rule, not
very skilful in picking out the special branches (sometimes even the
operations) in agriculture which indicate that agriculture is being
progressively drawn into the process of exchange in world
economy. Small-scale production

    

maintains itself on the ruins of natural economy by constant worsening of
diet, by chronic starvation, by lengthening of the working day, by
deterioration in the quality and the care of cattle, in a word, by the very
methods whereby handicraft production maintained itself against capitalist
manufacture. Every advance in science and technology inevitably and
relentlessly undermines the foundations of small-scale production in
capitalist society; and it is the task of socialist political economy to
investigate this process in all its forms, often complicated and intricate,
and to demonstrate to the small producer the impossibility of his holding
his own under capitalism, the hopelessness of peasant farming under
capitalism, and the necessity for the peasant to adopt the standpoint of
the proletarian. On this question the revisionists sinned, in the
scientific sense, by superficial generalisations based on facts selected
one-sidedly and without reference to the system of capitalism as a
whole. From the political point of view, they sinned by the fact that they
inevitably, whether they wanted to or not, invited or urged the peasant to
adopt the attitude of a small proprietor (i.e., the attitude of the
bourgeoisie) instead of urging him to adopt the point of view of the
revolutionary proletarian.  

The position of revisionism was even worse as regards the theory of
crises and the theory of collapse. Only for a very short time could people,
and then only the most short-sighted, think of refashioning the foundations
of Marx’s theory under the influence of a few years of industrial
boom and prosperity. Realities very soon made it clear to the revisionists
that crises were not a thing of the past: prosperity was followed by a
crisis. The forms, the sequence, the picture of particular crises changed,
but crises remained an inevitable component of the capitalist system. While
uniting production, the cartels and trusts at the same time, and in a way
that was obvious to all, aggravated the anarchy of production, the
insecurity of existence of the proletariat and the oppression of capital,
thereby intensifying class antagonisms to an unprecedented degree. That
capitalism is heading for a break-down—in the sense both of individual
political and economic crises and of the complete collapse of the entire
capitalist system—has

    

been made particularly clear, and on a particularly large scale, precisely
by the new giant trusts. The recent financial crisis in America and the
appalling increase of unemployment all over Europe, to say nothing of the
impending industrial crisis to which many symptoms are pointing—all this
has resulted in the recent “theories” of the revisionists having been
forgotten by everybody, including, apparently, many of the revisionists
themselves. But the lessons which this instability of the intellectuals had
given the working class must not be forgotten.  

As to the theory of value, it need only be said that apart from the
vaguest of hints and sighs, à la Böhm-Bawerk, the
revisionists have contributed absolutely nothing, and have therefore left
no traces whatever on the development of scientific thought.  

In the sphere of politics, revisionism did really try to revise the
foundation of Marxism, namely, the doctrine of the class
struggle. Political freedom, democracy and universal suffrage remove the
ground for the class struggle—we were told—and render untrue the old
proposition of the Communist Manifesto that the working men have
no country. For, they said, since the “will of the majority” prevails in
a democracy, one must neither regard the state as an organ of class rule,
nor reject alliances with the progressive, social-reform bourgeoisie
against the reactionaries.  

It cannot be disputed that these arguments of the revisionists amounted
to a fairly well-balanced system of views, namely, the old and well-known
liberal-bourgeois views. The liberals have always said that bourgeois
parliamentarism destroys classes and class divisions, since the right to
vote and the right to participate in the government of the country are
shared by all citizens without distinction. The whole history of Europe in
the second half of the nineteenth century, and the whole history of the
Russian revolution in the early twentieth, clearly show how absurd such
views are. Economic distinctions are not mitigated but aggravated and
intensified under the freedom of “democratic” capitalism. Parliamentarism
does not eliminate, but lays bare the innate character even of the most
democratic bourgeois republics as organs of class oppression. By helping to
enlighten and to organise immeasurably wider

    

masses of the population than those which previously took an active part in
political events, parliamentarism does not make for the elimination of
crises and political revolutions, but for the maximum intensification of
civil war during such revolutions. The events in Paris in the spring of
1871 and the events in Russia in the winter of 1905 showed as clearly as
could be how inevitably this intensification comes about. The French
bourgeoisie without a moment’s hesitation made a deal with the enemy
of the whole nation, with the foreign army which had ruined its country, in
order to crush the proletarian movement. Whoever does not understand the
inevitable inner dialectics of parliamentarism and bourgeois
democracy—which leads to an even sharper decision of the argument by mass
violence than formerly—will never be able on the basis of this
parliamentarism to conduct propaganda and agitation consistent in
principle, really preparing the working-class masses for victorious
participation in such “arguments”. The experience of alliances,
agreements and blocs with the social-reform liberals in the West and with
the liberal reformists (Cadets) in the Russian revolution, has convincingly
shown that these agreements only blunt the consciousness of the masses,
that they do not enhance but weaken the actual significance of their
struggle, by linking fighters with elements who are least capable of
fighting and most vacillating and treacherous. Millerandism in France—the
biggest experiment in applying revisionist political tactics on a wide, a
really national scale—has provided a practical appraisal of revisionism
that will never be forgotten by the proletariat all over the world.  

A natural complement to the economic and political tendencies of
revisionism was its attitude to the ultimate aim of the socialist
movement. “The movement is everything, the ultimate aim is nothing"—this
catch-phrase of Bernstein’s expresses the substance of revisionism
better than many long disquisitions. To determine its conduct from case to
case, to adapt itself to the events of the day and to the chopping and
changing of petty politics, to forget the primary interests of the
proletariat and the basic features of the whole capitalist system, of all
capitalist evolution, to sacrifice these primary interests for the

    

real or assumed advantages of the moment—such is the policy of
revisionism. And it patently follows from the very nature of this policy
that it may assume an infinite variety of forms, and that every more or
less “new” question, every more or less unexpected and unforeseen turn of
events, even though it change the basic line of development only to an
insignificant degree and only for the briefest period, will always
inevitably give rise to one variety of revisionism or another.  

The inevitability of revisionism is determined by its class roots in
modern society. Revisionism is an international phenomenon. No thinking
socialist who is in the least informed can have the slightest doubt that
the relation between the orthodox and the Bernsteinians in Germany, the
Guesdists and the Jaurèsists (and now particularly the Broussists)
in France, the Social Democratic Federation and the Independent Labour
Party in Great Britain, Brouckère and Vandervelde in Belgium, the
Integralists and the Reformists in Italy, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks
in Russia, is everywhere essentially similar, notwithstanding the immense
variety of national conditions and historical factors in the present state
of all these countries. In reality, the “division” within the present
international socialist movement is now proceeding along the same
lines in all the various countries of the world, which testifies to a
tremendous advance compared with thirty or forty years ago, when
heterogeneous trends in the various countries were struggling within the
one international socialist movement. And that “revisionism from the
left” which has taken shape in the Latin countries as

“revolutionary syndicalism”,[4] is also adapting itself to Marxism,
“amending” it: Labriola in Italy and Lagardelle in France frequently
appeal from Marx who is understood wrongly to Marx who is understood
rightly.  

We cannot stop here to analyse the ideological content of this
revisionism, which as yet is far from having developed to the same extent
as opportunist revisionism: it has not yet become international, has not
yet stood the test of a single big practical battle with a socialist party
in any single country. We confine ourselves therefore to that “revisionism
from the right” which was described above.  
 

Wherein lies its inevitability in capitalist society? Why is it more
profound than the differences of national peculiarities and of degrees of
capitalist development? Because in every capitalist country, side by side
with the proletariat, there are always broad strata of the petty
bourgeoisie, small proprietors. Capitalism arose and is constantly arising
out of small production. A number of new “middle strata” are inevitably
brought into existence again and again by capitalism (appendages to the
factory, work at home, small workshops scattered all over the country to
meet the requirements of big industries, such as the bicycle and automobile
industries, etc.). These new small producers are just as inevitably being
cast again into the ranks of the proletariat. It is quite natural that the
petty-bourgeois world-outlook should again and again crop up in the ranks
of the broad workers’ parties. It is quite natural that this should be so
and always will be so, right up to the changes of fortune that will take
place in the proletarian revolution. For it would be a profound mistake to
think that the “complete” proletarianisation of the majority of the
population is essential for bringing about such a revolution. What we now
frequently experience only in the domain of ideology, namely, disputes over
theoretical amendments to Marx; what now crops up in practice only over
individual side issues of the labour movement, as tactical differences with
the revisionists and splits on this basis—is bound to be experienced by
the working class on an incomparably larger scale when the proletarian
revolution will sharpen all disputed issues, will focus all differences on
points which are of the most immediate importance in determining the
conduct of the masses, and will make it necessary in the heat of the fight
to distinguish enemies from friends, and to cast out bad allies in order to
deal decisive blows at the enemy.  

The ideological struggle waged by revolutionary Marxism against
revisionism at the end of the nineteenth century is but the prelude to the
great revolutionary battles of the proletariat, which is marching forward
to the complete victory of its cause despite all the waverings and
weaknesses of the petty bourgeoisie.

“Revolutionary syndicalism"— a petty-bourgeois
semi-anarchist trend that made its appearance in the labour movement of a
number of West-European countries at the close of the nineteenth century.


The syndicalists saw no need for the working class to engage in
political struggle, they repudiated the leading role of the Party and the
dictatorship of the proletariat. They believed that by organising a general
strike of the workers the trade unions (in France—syndicats) could,
without a revolution, overthrow capitalism and take over control of
production.

      The article “The Heritage We Renounce” was written at
      the close of 1897 when in exile in Siberia. In 1898 it was published in
      the miscellany Economic Studies and Essays.






      Referring, in Russkoye Bogatstvo, No. 10, 1897, to a comment by
      Mr. Minsky on the “dialectical materialists,” Mr. Mikhailovsky
      says: “He” (Mr. Minsky) “must know that these people do
      not acknowledge any continuity with the past and emphatically renounce the
      heritage” (p. 179) — that is, the “heritage of the
      1860-70s,” which Mr. V. Rozanov solemnly renounced in 1891 in
      Moskovskiye Vedomosti (p. 478).

    
      Mr. Mikhailovsky’s statement about the “Russian
      disciples” is a falsehood. True, he is not the only, and not the
      independent, author of the falsehood that “the Russian disciples
      renounce the heritage”—it has been reiterated for quite a
      longtime now by practically all the representatives of the
      liberal-Narodnik press when fighting the “disciples.” As far
      as we remember, when Mr. Mikhailovsky began his fierce war on the
      “disciples” he had not yet invented this falsehood but others
      had done so before him. Later he, too, chose to seize upon it. The further
      the “disciples” developed their views in Russian literature,
      the more minutely and thoroughly they set forth their opinions on a number
      of issues, both theoretical and practical, the more rarely did one find
      the hostile press objecting in substance to the fundamental tenets of the
      new trend, to the view that Russian capitalism is progressive, that the
      Narodnik idealisation of the small producer is absurd, that the
      explanation of trends of social thought and of legal and political
      institutions must be sought in the material interests of the various
      classes of Russian society. These fundamental tenets were hushed up,

 

      it was—and still is—thought best to say nothing about them,
      but fabrications to discredit the new trend were con-coded with all the
      greater fertility. One of these fabrications—”shabby
      fabrications”—-is the modish phrase that “the Russian
      disciples renounce the heritage,” that they have broken with the
      best traditions of the best, the most progressive section of Russian
      society, that they have severed the democratic thread, etc., etc., and all
      the many other ways in which this is expressed. The fact that such phrases
      are so widely used prompts us to undertake a detailed examination and
      refutation of them. In order that our exposition may not appear
      unsupported, we shall begin by drawing an historico-literary parallel
      between two “essayists of the countryside,” chosen in order to
      describe the “heritage.” Let us say in advance that we shall
      confine ourselves exclusively to economic and social questions, that of
      the ‘heritage,” we shall examine only these, leaving aside
      philosophical, literary, aesthetic and other problems.
    
I
One Representative Of The “Heritage”

      Thirty years ago, in 1867, Otechestvenniye

Zapiski[17]
began publishing a series of essays by Skaldin, under the title In
the Backwoods and in the Capital. The essays appeared over a period
of three years, 1867-69. In 1870 the author gathered them together in a
single volume bearing the same

      title.[1]

 A perusal
  of this book, now almost forgotten, is extremely instructive from the
  angle of the subject under discussion, i.e., the relation in which the
  representatives of the “heritage” stand to the Narodniks
  and the “Russian disciples.” The title of the book is
  inaccurate. The author himself was conscious of this, and he explains
  in a foreword that his theme is the attitude of the
  “capital” to the “countryside,” in other
  words, that his book is a series of social essays on rural conditions,
  and that he does not propose to

 

      speak of the capital specifically. Or rather, he might have proposed to do
  so, but does not find it expedient:

ως δε
  βουλομ

(for I will not write as I may, and may not write as I will), Skaldin says,
  borrowing the words of a Greek writer to explain the
  inexpediency.

    
      Let us give a brief exposition of Skaldin’s views.

    
      We shall begin with the peasant

      Reform[18]—that
      initial point from which all who wish to expound their general views on
      economic and social problems must, even to this day, inevitably
      begin. Very much space is devoted to the peasant Reform in Skaldin’s
      book. He was perhaps the first writer who—on a broad basis of fact
      and a detailed examination of all aspects of life in the
      countryside—systematically showed the poverty-stricken state of the
      peasants after the Reform, the deterioration of their conditions,
      the new forms of their subjection, economic, legal and in daily
      life—the first, in a word, to show all that has since been
      elucidated and demonstrated in such detail and thoroughness in numerous
      investigations and surveys. Today all these truths are no longer new. At
      that time they were not only new, but aroused distrust in liberal society,
      which feared that behind these references to the so-called “defects
      of the Reform” lurked a condemnation of it and concealed support for
      serfdom. Skaldin’s views are the more interesting because he was a
      contemporary of the Reform (and even perhaps had a hand in it. We have no
      historical or literary information or biographical data about him at our
      disposal). Consequently, his views are based on direct observation both of
      the “capital” and the “countryside” of the time,
      and not on an armchair study of printed material.

    
      What first of all strikes the contemporary reader, who is accustomed to
      the Narodniks’ sickly gushing over the peasant Reform, is the
      extreme sobriety of Skaldin’s views on the subject. He
      looks at the Reform without any illusions or idealisation; he sees it as a
      transaction between two parties, the landlords and the peasants, who until
      then had used the land in common on definite terms and now had divided it,
      the division being accompanied by a change in the legal status of both
      parties. The factor which determined the mode of division and the size of
      the share of each party was their

 

      respective interests. These interests determined the ambitions of both
      parties, while the fact that one of them was able to have a direct hand in
      the Reform itself, and in the practical working-out of the various
      questions connected with its implementation, determined, among other
      things, that party’s dominant position. That is how Skaldin
      understands the Reform. He dwells in particular detail on the principal
      question of the Reform, the allotments and land redemption payments,
      reverting to it time and again in the course of his
      essays. (Skaldin’s book is divided into eleven essays, each of them
      self-contained, their form reminding one of letters from the
      countryside. The first essay is dated 1866, and the last, 1869.) It goes
      without saying that on the subject of the so-called
      ‘land-poor” peasants, there is nothing in Skaldin’s book
      that is new to the contemporary reader, but at the end of the sixties his
      testimony was both new and valuable. We shall not, of course, recapitulate
      it, but shall only remark on that feature of his description of the facts
      which distinguishes him—to his advantage—from the
      Narodniks. Skaldin does not talk about “land poverty,” but
      about the “excessive amount of land cut off from the peasants’
      allotments” (p. 213, also p. 214 and many other places; cf. title of
      the third essay), and says that the largest allotments established by the
      Regulations[19] proved
      to be smaller than those they had before (p. 257), incidentally citing
      some extremely characteristic and typical opinions of peasants on this
      aspect of the

Reform.[2]

 Skaldin’s explanations and proofs of this
      fact are very circumstantial, forceful and even vehement for a writer who
      as a rule is extremely moderate and temperate, and whose general outlook
      is undoubtedly bourgeois. The fact, then, must have been too starkly
      evident, if such a writer as Skaldin speaks of it so emphatically. Skaldin
      also speaks very emphatically and circumstantially of the severe burden of
      the payments, and supports his statements with

 

      many facts. “Inordinate taxation,” reads a sub-title to the
      third essay (1867), “is the chief cause of their” (the
      peasants’) “poverty,” and Skaldin shows that taxation is
      higher than the peasants returns from the land, and he cites from the
      Proceedings of the Commission on Taxation data relative to the
      incidence of taxation of the upper and lower classes in Russia which show
      that 76% of the taxation falls on the lower classes and 17% on the upper,
      whereas in Western Europe the correlation is everywhere incomparably more
      favourable to the lower classes. A sub-title to the seventh essay (1868)
      reads, “Excessive money dues are one of the chief causes of poverty
      among the peasants,” and the author shows that the new conditions of
      life at once demanded money, money and more money of the peasant, that the
      Regulation made it a principle to compensate the landlords for the
      abolition of serfdom as well (252), and that the amount of the quit-rent
      was based “on sworn information supplied by the landlords, their
      stewards and village elders, that is, on absolutely arbitrary data not
      deserving of the slightest credence” (255), in consequence of which
      the average quit-rents computed by the commissions were higher than the
      existing average quit-rents. “Added to the burden of quit-rent borne
      by the Peasants was the loss of land which they had used for
      centuries” (258). “Had the redemption price of the land not
      been assessed on the basis of the capitalised amount of the quit-rents,
      but on the basis of its actual value at the time of the emancipation, the
      redemption could have been paid off very easily and would not even have
      required the assistance of the government, or the issue of credit
      certificates” (264). “Redemption, which was designed by the
      Regulation of February 19 to make things easier for the peasants and to
      consummate the work of improving their conditions, in reality often has
      the effect of putting them into even more straitened circumstances”
      (269). We cite these excerpts—which, in themselves, are of little
      interest and are in part out-of-date—in order to show how
      energetically the peasants’ interests were defended by a writer who
      was hostile to the village community and whose opinions on a whole number
      of questions were those of a true member of the Manchester School. It is
      very instructive to note that nearly all the useful and non-reactionary
      precepts of

 

      Narodism fully coincide with those of this Mancunian. It goes without
      saying that, such being Skaldin’s opinion of the Reform, he could
      not possibly sentimentally idealise it in the way the Narodniks did, and
      still do, when they say that it sanctioned people’s production, that
      it was superior to the West-European peasant reforms, that it made a
      tabula rasa of Russia, and so on. Skaldin did not and could not say
      anything of the kind; further, he said plainly that in our country peasant
      Reform was less advantageous, less beneficial to the peasants than in the
      West. “The question will be put plainly,” he wrote, “if
      we ask ourselves why the beneficial consequences of the emancipation in
      our country are not growing with the steady speed with which they did,
      say, in Prussia or Saxony in the first quarter of the present
      century” (221). “In Prussia, and throughout Germany, the
      peasants paid not for the redemption of their allotments, which had long
      been recognised as their property by law, but for the redemption of their
      compulsory services to the landlords”(272).

    
      Let us now pass from the economic to the legal aspect of the Reform, as
      Skaldin sees it. Skaldin is a bitter foe of collective responsibility, of
      the passport system, and of the patriarchal power of the peasant
      “community” (and of the urban community) over its members. In
      the third essay (1867) he insists on the abolition of collective
      responsibility, the poll tax and the passport system, on the necessity for
      an equitable property tax, and on the replacement of passports by free and
      permanent certificates. “In no other civilised country is there a
      tax on internal passports” (109). We know that this tax was only
      abolished in 1897. In the title to the fourth essay, we read:
      “arbitrary actions of village communities and urban dumas in sending
      out passports and levying taxes on absentee
      payers.”... “Collective responsibility is a heavy burden which
      efficient and industrious husbandmen have to bear on account of idlers and
      wastrels” (126). Skaldin is disposed to attribute the
      differentiation of the peasantry, which was already to be observed at that
      time, to the personal qualities of those who get on or go under. He
      describes in detail the difficulties peasants living in St. Petersburg
      experience in obtaining or prolonging passports, and repudiates those who
      would retort that “thank God, all this multitude of landless
      peasants have not been registered

 

      in the towns, have not increased the numbers of propertyless
      town-dwellers” (130).... “This barbarous collective
      responsibility (131). ... “Can people placed in such a position be
      called free citizens? Are they not the same old glebae
adscripti?[3]

”

(132). The
      peasant Reform is blamed. “But is the peasant Reform to blame for
      the fact that the law, having released the peasant from his bond to the
      landlord has devised nothing to deliver him from his bond to his community
      and place of registration?... Where are the attributes of civil liberty,
      if the peasant is not free to decide either his place of domicile or
      manner of occupation?” (132). Skaldin very accurately and aptly
      calls our peasant a “settled proletarian”

(231).[4]

 In the heading to the
      eighth essay (1868) we read: “the fact that the peasants are tied to
      their communities and allotments prevents improvement of their
      conditions.... It is. an obstacle to the development of outside
      industries.” “Apart from the ignorance of the peasants and the
      burden of progressively mounting taxation, one of the causes retarding the
      development of peasant labour and, consequently, of peasant prosperity, is
      the fact that they are tied to their communities and allotments. The tying
      of the labourer to one place and the shackling of the rural community in
      unbreakable fetters—this in itself is an extremely unfavourable
      condition for the development of labour, private enterprise and small
      landed property” (284). “Bound to their allotments and
      communities, and unable to apply their labour where it would be more
      productive and of greater advantage to themselves, the peasants are, as it
      were, frozen in that congested, herdlike, unproductive form of life in
      which they emerged from serfdom” (285).

 

      Skaldin, consequently, regards these aspects of peasant life from the
      purely bourgeois standpoint, but in spite of that (and, perhaps, because
      of it), his assessment of the harm caused to all social development and to
      the peasants themselves by the fact that the latter are tied down is very
      accurate. And it causes particular harm (let us add) to the lowest
      sections of the peasantry, the rural proletariat. Skaldin says very aptly:
      “the concern of the law that the peasants shall not remain without
      land is admirable; but it should not be forgotten that the concern of the
      peasants themselves on this score is incomparably greater than that of any
      legislator” (286). “Apart from the fact that the peasant is
      bound to his allotment and his community, even his temporary departure to
      earn something elsewhere involves considerable difficulty and expense,
      owing to collective responsibility and the passport system”
      (29S). “For many peasants, in my opinion, a way out of their
      difficult situation would be opened if ... measures were taken to make it
      easier for peasants to give up their land” (294). Here Skaldin is
      expressing a wish that runs sharply counter to the Narodnik projects,
      which all tend in the very opposite direction, namely, to perpetuate the
      village community, to make the allotments inalienable, etc. There has been
      ample evidence since then to show that Skaldin was perfectly right: the
      fact that the peasant remains tied to the land, and that the peasant
      community is an exclusive social estate only worsens the position of the
      rural proletariat and retards the country’s economic development,
      while being unable in any degree to protect the “settled
      proletarian” from the worst forms of bondage and subjection, or from
      the decline of his wages and living standards to the very lowest level.

    
      The reader may have already seen from the above-quoted excerpts that
      Skaldin is a foe of the village community. He objects to the community and
      to land redistribution because he favours private property, enterprise and
      so on (P. 142, et seq.). To the defenders of the village community Skaldin
      retorts that “the ancient common law” has outlived its
      day. “In all countries,” he writes, “as the rural
      dwellers came into contact with a civilised environment, their common law
      lost its primeval purity and became subject to corruption and
      distortion. The same is to be observed in our country:

 

      the power of the community is gradually being turned into the power of the
      village exploiters and rural clerks and, instead of protecting the person
      of the peasant, is a heavy burden upon him” (143)—a very true
      observation, corroborated by endless facts in these thirty years. In
      Skaldin’s opinion, “the patriarchal family, communal ownership
      of the land and common law” have been irrevocably condemned by
      history. “Those who would preserve these venerable monuments of past
      centuries for us in perpetuity, show thereby that they are more capable of
      being carried away by an idea than of penetrating into realities and
      grasping the irresistible march of history” (162), and to. this
      correct observation Skaldin adds hot Manchester School
      philippics. “Community land tenure,” he says elsewhere,
      “places every peasant in slavish subjection to the whole
      community” (222). Therefore, Skaldin’s unreserved hostility to
      the village community from the purely bourgeois standpoint is combined
      with his consistent defence of the peasants’ interests. Hostile
      though he is to the village community, Skaldin does not advance foolish
      projects for forcibly abolishing the community and forcibly introducing
      some other, similar system of land ownership, such as are usually
      concocted by the present-day opponents of the village community, who
      favour gross interferences in the peasants’ life and attack the
      village community from anything but the standpoint of the peasants’
      interests. Skaldin, on the contrary, strongly protests against being
      classed with the believers in “forcible abolition of communal Land
      tenure” (144). “The Regulation of February 19,” he says,
      “very wisely left it to the peasants themselves ... to pass ... from
      communal to family tenure.  Indeed, none but the peasants themselves can
      properly decide the best time for such passage.” Consequently,
      Skaldin is opposed to the village community only for the reason that it
      hampers economic development, prevents the peasant from withdrawing from
      the community and giving up his land, that is, for the same reason that
      the “Russian disciples” are opposed to it today; this
      hostility has nothing in common with defence of the selfish interests of
      the landlords, with defence of the survivals and the spirit of serfdom,
      with advocacy of interference in the life of the peasants. It is very
      important to note this difference, because the

      present-day. 

 

      Narodniks, who are accustomed to seeing enemies of the village community
      only in the camp of Moskovskiye Vedomosti and the like, very
      willingly pretend to be oblivious to any other kind of hostility to the
      village community.

    
      Skaldin’s general opinion about the causes of the peasants’
      distressed condition is that they are all survivals of serfdom. Describing
      the famine of 1868, he remarks that the serf-owners pointed to it with
      malicious glee, ascribing it to the dissoluteness of the peasants, to the
      abolition of the landlords’ tutelage, and so on. Skaldin heatedly
      refutes these views. “The causes of the impoverishment of the
      peasants,” he says, “were inherited from serfdom
      (212), and are not the result of its abolition; they are the general
      causes which keep the majority of our peasants at a level bordering on
      that of the proletariat”—and he repeats the above-quoted
      opinions of the Reform. It is absurd to attack the family division of the
      land: “Even if divisions do injure the peasants’ material
      interests for a while, they save their personal freedom and the moral
      dignity of the peasant family, that is, those higher human blessings
      without which no civil progress is possible” (217), and Skaldin
      rightly points to the real reasons for the campaign against land
      divisions: “many landlords highly exaggerate the harm caused by
      divisions, blaming them, as well as drunkenness, for all the consequences
      of the various causes of the peasants’ poverty, which the landlords
      are so unwilling to recognise” (218). To those who say that much is
      being written today about the peasants’ poverty, but that formerly
      it was not so and that therefore the peasants’ conditions must have
      deteriorated, Skaldin replies that: “In order to form a judgement of
      the results of the peasants’ emancipation from the landlords’
      power, by comparing the peasants’ present with their former
      condition, it would have been necessary, while serfdom still prevailed, to
      trim down the peasants’ allotments as they have been now trimmed
      down, and to tax the peasants with all the duties which have appeared
      since the emancipation, and then see how the peasant serfs would have
      borne such conditions” (219). It is a supremely characteristic and
      important feature of Skaldin’s views that’ he reduces all the
      causes of the deterioration in the peasants’ condition to survivals
      of serfdom, to its legacy of labour service, quit-rent,

 

      cut-off land, and the peasants’ lack of rights, and
      immobility. Skaldin not only does not see that the causes of the
      peasants’ impoverishment might be found in the very structure of the
      new socio-economic relations, in the very structure of the post-Reform
      economy; he absolutely refuses to entertain the thought, being profoundly
      convinced that the complete abolition of all these survivals of serfdom
      would usher in an era of universal well-being. His views, in fact, are
      negative: remove the obstacles to the free development of the peasantry,
      remove the shackles bequeathed by serfdom, and everything will be for the
      best in this best of possible worlds. Skaldin writes: “Here”
      (i. e., in relation to the peasantry) “there is only one course the
      government can follow: to eliminate steadily and unflaggingly
      the causes which have reduced our peasants to their present state
      of dullness and poverty and which do not allow them to rise to their
      feet” (224, my italics). Highly characteristic in this respect is
      the reply given by Skaldin to those who defend the “community”
      (that is, binding the peasants to the village communities and allotments)
      on the ground that, without it, “a rural proletariat will
      emerge.” “This objection,” Skaldin says, “falls to
      the ground when we remember what boundless tracts of land lie idle in our
      country from lack of hands to cultivate them. If the law did not hamper
      the natural distribution of manpower, the only people who would be real
      proletarians in Russia would be the professional beggars or the
      incorrigibly vicious and dissipated” (144)—the typical view of
      the eighteenth-century economists and “enlighteners,” who
      believed that abolition of serfdom and all its survivals would usher in a
      reign of universal well-being on earth. The Narodnik would no doubt look
      down on Skaldin with disdain and say that he was simply a bourgeois. Yes,
      of course, Skaldin was a bourgeois, but he was a representative of the
      progressive bourgeois ideology which the Narodniks have replaced by one
      that is petty-bourgeois and, on a whole number of points, reactionary. And
      this “bourgeois” had a better idea than the Narodnik of how to
      defend those practical and real interests of the peasants which coincided,
      and coincide now, with the requirements of social development

      generally![5]




      To complete our account of Skaldin’s views, let us add that he is
      opposed to the system of social estates, advocates a single court of
      justice for all of them, sympathises “theoretically” with the
      idea that the volost authorities should not be constituted on the basis of
      social estates, is an ardent advocate of public education, especially
      general education, favours local self-government and Zemstvo institutions,
      and believes that land credits, especially small, should be widely
      available, for there is a strong desire among the peasants to buy
      land. Here, too, Skaldin is a true “Mancunian”: he says, for
      instance, that Zemstvo and municipal banks are “a patriarchal or
      primitive form of bank” and should give way to private banks, which
      are “vastly superior” (80). The land might be endowed with
      value “through the stimulation of industrial and commercial activity
      in our provinces” (71), and so on.

    
      To sum up. In outlook, Skaldin may be called a bourgeois enlightener. His
      views are very reminiscent of those of the eighteenth-century economists
      (correspondingly refracted, of course, in the prism of Russian
      conditions), and he reflected the general “enlightenment”
      character of the “heritage” of the sixties quite vividly. Like
      the West-European enlighteners and the majority of the literary
      representatives of the sixties, Skaldin was imbued with a violent
      hostility to serfdom and all its economic, social and legal products. That
      was the first characteristic feature of the “enlightener.” The
      second characteristic feature common to all the Russian enlighteners was
      ardent advocacy of education, self-government, liberty, European forms of
      life and all-round Europeanisation of Russia generally. And the third
      characteristic feature of the “enlightener” was his defence of
      the interests of the masses, chiefly of the peasants (who, in the days of
      the enlighteners, were not yet fully emancipated or only in process of
      being emancipated), the sincere belief that abolition of serfdom and its
      survivals would be followed by universal well-being, and a sincere desire
      to help bring this about. These three features constitute the

 

      essence of what In our country is called “the heritage of the
      sixties,” and it is important to emphasise that there is nothing
      whatsoever of Narodism in this heritage. There are quite a number of
      Russian writers whose views are characterised by these features and who
      have never had anything in common with Narodism. Where the outlook of a
      writer bears these features, he is always recognised by everyone as having
      “preserved the traditions of the sixties,” quite irrespective
      of what his attitude to Narodism may be. Nobody, of course, would think of
      saying that Mr. M. Stasyulevich, for instance, whose jubilee was recently
      celebrated, had “renounced the heritage” —merely because
      he was an opponent of Narodism or was indifferent to the questions
      advanced by Narodism. We have taken

Skaldin[6]

 as an example precisely because,
      while he was undoubtedly a representative of the
      “heritage,” he was at the same time a confirmed enemy of those
      ancient institutions which the Narodniks have taken under their
      protection.

    
      We have said that Skaldin was a bourgeois. Ample proof of this description
      has been given above, but it must be observed that this word is often
      understood very incorrectly, narrowly and unhistorically, it being
      associated (without distinction of historical period) with a
      selfish defence of the interests of a minority. It must not be forgotten
      that at the time when the eighteenth-century enlighteners (who are by
      general consent included among the leaders of the bourgeoisie)

 

      wrote, and at the time when our enlighteners of the forties and sixties
      wrote, all social problems amounted to the struggle against serfdom and
      its survivals. At that time the new socio-economic relations and their
      contradictions were still in embryo. No selfishness was therefore
      displayed at that time by the ideologists of the bourgeoisie; on the
      contrary, both in the West and in Russia, they quite sincerely believed in
      universal well-being and sincerely desired it, they sincerely did not see
      (partly could not yet see) the contradictions in the system which was
      growing out of serfdom. It is not for nothing that Skaldin in one part of
      his book quotes Adam Smith: we have seen that both his views and the
      character of his arguments in many respects repeat the theses of that
      great ideologist of the progressive bourgeoisie.

    
      And so, if we compare Skaldin’s practical suggestions with the views
      of the present-day Narodniks, on the one hand, and with the attitude to
      them of the “Russian disciples,” on the other, we shall find
      that the “disciples” will always support Skaldin’s
      suggestions, since the latter reflect the interests of the progressive
      social classes, and the vital interests of social development generally
      along the present, i. e., capitalist, path. The things that the Narodniks
      have changed in Skaldin’s practical wishes, or in his presentation
      of problems, are a change for the worse, and are rejected by the
      “disciples.” It is not against the “heritage” that
      the disciples “hurl themselves” (that is an absurd
      fabrication), but against the romantic and petty-bourgeois additions to
      the heritage made by the Narodniks. To these additions we shall now pass.
    
 II 

      Narodism’s Addition to the “Heritage”
    

      From Skaldin, let us pass to Engelhardt. His Letters from the
      Countryside are likewise essays on the social aspects of rural life,
      so that in substance and even in form his book very much resembles that of
      Skaldin’s. Engelhardt is much more talented than Skaldin, and his
      letters from the country are incomparably more lively and imaginative. The
      lengthy disquisitions of the serious author of In the

 

Backwoods and in the Capital are not to be found in
      Engelhardt’s book, which, for its part, is replete with deft
      delineation and imagery. It is not surprising that Engelhardt’s book
      enjoys the steady sympathy of the reading public, and only recently
      appeared in a fresh edition, while Skaldin’s book is almost
      completely forgotten, although it was only two years after its publication
      that Otechestvenniye Zapiski began printing Engelhardt’s
      letters. There is therefore no need for us to acquaint the reader with the
      contents of Engelhardt’s book, and we shall confine ourselves to a
      brief exposition of two aspects of his views: first, views that are
      characteristic of the “heritage” in general, and common to
      Engelhardt and Skaldin in particular; and, second, views that are
      specifically Narodnik. Engelhardt is already a Narodnik, but his
      views still contain so much that is common to all the enlighteners, so
      much that has been discarded or altered by contemporary Narodism, that one
      is at a loss how to class him—with the representatives of the
      “heritage” in general, without the Narodnik tinge, or with the
      Narodniks.

    
      What makes Engelhardt akin to the former is, primarily, the remarkable
      sobriety of his views, his plain and direct descriptions of realities, his
      relentless exposure of all the bad sides of the “foundations”
      in general, and of the peasantry in particular—of those very
      “foundations,” the false idealisation and embellishment of
      which is an essential component of Narodism. Engelhardt’s very
      feebly and timidly expressed Narodism is therefore in direct and crying
      contradiction to the picture of rural realities that he paints with such
      talent, and if some economist or sociologist were to base his opinions of
      the countryside on Engelhardt’s facts and

observations,[7]

he would find it
      impossible to draw Narodnik conclusions from such material. Idealisation
      of the peasant and his village community is one of the essential

 

      components of Narodism, and Narodniks of all shades, from Mr. V. V. to
      Mr. Mikhailovsky, have given full rein to this effort to idealise and
      embellish the “community.” There is not the slightest trace of
      such embellishment in Engelhardt. As against the fashionable talk about
      the communal spirit of our peasantry, the current contrasting of this
      “communal spirit” to the individualism of the town, the
      competition of capitalist economy, etc., Engelhardt is absolutely
      relentless in exposing the amazing individualism of the small
      farmer. He shows at length that our “peasants in matter of ownership
      have the keenest possible sense of property” (p. 62, 1885 ed.), that
      they cannot tolerate “gang work,” hate it from narrowly
      selfish and egoistic motives: in gang work each is “afraid of doing
      more than the others” (p. 206). This fear of doing more work than
      others goes to comical (or, rather, tragicomical) extremes; the author,
      for instance tells of women living under one roof and bound by ties of
      common residence and kinship, each of whom washes only her particular part
      of the table at which they eat, or who milk the cows in turn, each getting
      milk for her own child (for fear that others may hide some of the milk)
      and preparing porridge for her own child separately (p. 323). Engelhardt
      brings out these features in such detail, and corroborates them with such
      a mass of examples, that there can be no question of their being
      exceptional instances. One or the other: either Engelhardt is a worthless
      observer who deserves no credence, or the tale about the communal spirit
      and communal virtues of our muzhik are sheer imagination, which transfers
      to economic practice features abstracted from the form of land
      tenure (and from this form of landholding there are additionally
      abstracted all the fiscal and administrative aspects). Engelhardt shows
      that in his economic activity the muzhik aims at becoming a
      kulak. “There is a definite dose of the kulak in every
      peasant,” he says (p. 491), “kulak ideals prevail among the
      peasants.”... “I have said time and again that individualism,
      egoism, the urge to exploit are strongly developed among the
      peasants.”... “Each prides himself on being a pike and strives
      to swallow the tiddler.” Engelhardt demonstrates superbly that the
      trend among the peasantry is not towards the “communal”
      system, not towards “people’s production,” but towards
      the most ordinary

 

      petty-bourgeois system inherent in all capitalist societies. He describes
      and proves incontrovertibly the tendency of the well-to-do peasant to
      launch into trade (363), to loan grain in return for work, to buy the
      labour of the poor muzhik (pp. 457, 492, etc.)—or, in economic
      language, the conversion of enterprising muzhiks into a rural
      bourgeoisie. “If,” says Engelhardt, “the peasants do not
      adopt the artel form of economy and each continues to conduct his own farm
      in isolation, then, even if there is an abundance of land, there will be
      both landless peasants and farm labourers among the peasant
      tillers. Further, I believe that the difference in status among the
      peasants will be even wider than it now is. Despite communal ownership of
      the land, side by side with the rich,’ there will be many virtually
      landless farm labourers. “What benefit is it to me or my children if
      I have the right to land, but neither the capital nor the implements with
      which to cultivate it? It is like giving a blind man land and
      saying—eat it!” (p. 370). With a sort of melancholy irony, the
      “artel form of economy’ figures forlornly in this passage as a
      pious and innocent wish which, far from following from the facts about the
      peasantry, is directly repudiated and ruled out by them.

    
      Another feature which makes Engelhardt akin to the representatives of the
      heritage without any Narodnik tinge is his belief that the chief and
      fundamental cause of the distressed condition of the peasantry is the
      survivals of serfdom and the reglementation characteristic of it. Do away
      with these survivals and this reglementation, and all will be
      well. Engelhardt’s absolute hostility to reglementation and his
      caustic scoffing at all attempts to confer happiness on the muzhik through
      reglementation from above, are in the sharpest contrast to the
      Narodniks’ faith in “the reason and conscience, the knowledge
      and patriotism of the ruling classes” (the words of Mr. Yuzhakov, in
      Russkoye Bogatstvo, 1896, No. 12, p. 106), to their fantastic
      projects for “organising production,” etc. Let us recall
      Engelhardt’s sarcastic denunciation of the rule that vodka
      should not be sold at flour-mills, a rule intended for the muzhik’s
      “good”; or the disgust with which he speaks of the obligatory
      order issued by several Zemstvos in 1880 forbid. ding the sowing of rye
      before August 15, of that gross interference

 

      by armchair scientists”—also actuated by consideration for the
      muzhik’s good—in the farming of “millions of
      peasant proprietors” (424). Referring to such rules and orders as
      those forbidding smoking in pine forests, pike fishing in spring, cutting
      birch for the May festival, bird-nest pillaging and so on, Engelhardt
      sarcastically remarks: solicitude for the muzhik is and always has been
      the principal concern of intellectual minds. Who lives for himself?
      Everybody lives for the muzhik!... The muzhik is stupid, he cannot manage
      his own affairs. If nobody looks after him, he will burn down all the
      forests, kill off all the birds, denude the rivers of fish, ruin the land,
      and himself die out” (398). Do you think, reader, that this writer
      could have had any sympathy for laws so dear to the hearts of the
      Narodniks, as, say, those forbidding alienation of allotments?  Could his
      pen have written anything like the phrase of one of the pillars of
      Russkoye Bogatstvo quoted above? Could he have shared the view of
      Mr. N. Karyshev, another pillar of the same journal, who flung the
      reproach at our gubernia Zemstvos (in the nineties!) that they “find
      no room” “for regular large and substantial expenditure on the
      organisation of agricultural

labour”?[8]

      Let us mention another feature which makes Engelhardt akin to Skaldin: his
      unconscious attitude to many purely bourgeois aspirations and
      measures. Not that Engelhardt tries to gild the petty bourgeois or to
      concoct excuses (& la Mr. V. V.) for not applying this designation to any
      particular entrepreneur—far from it. As a practical farmer,
      Engelhardt is simply infatuated with every progressive innovation, every
      improvement in farming methods, and completely fails to realise that the
      social form of these improvements is the most effective refutation of his
      own theory that capitalism is impossible in our country. Let us recall,
      for instance, how delighted We was with the success he achieved on his
      farm thanks to the introduction of the piece-rate system o!
      paying his workers (for flax scutching, threshing, etc.). Engelhardt
      does not even suspect that the substitution of piece rates for time rates
      is one of the most

 

      widespread methods by which a developing capitalist economy heightens the
      intensification of labour and increases the rate of surplus-value. Another
      example. Engelhardt scoffs at the programme of Zemledelcheskaya

      Gazeta[20]:
      “discontinuation of leasing fields for cycle

cultivation[21]; farming based on
      employment of labourers; introduction of improved machines, implements and
      cattle breeds and of multi-field system; improvement of meadows and
      pastures, etc., etc.” “All this, however, is nothing but
      general talk!” Engelhardt exclaims (128). Yet it was this programme
      that Engelhardt adopted in his own practical farming; he achieved
      technical progress on his own farm precisely by basing it on the
      employment of farm labourers. Or again: we know how frankly and faithfully
      Engelhardt exposed the real tendencies of the enterprising muzhik; but
      that did not prevent him from asserting that “it is not factories
      that are needed, but small” (Engelhardt’s italics)
      “rural distilleries, oil mills,” etc. (p. 33), that is, what
      is “needed” is that the rural bourgeoisie should go in for
      agricultural industries—which has always and everywhere been one of
      the major indications of agricultural capitalism. Here we have the
      influence of the fact that Engelhardt was not a theoretician but a
      practical farmer. It is one thing’ to argue that progress is
      possible without capitalism, and another thing to farm yourself. Having
      set himself the aim of conducting his farm on rational lines, Engelhardt
      was compelled, by virtue of surrounding circumstances, to strive
      for this by purely capitalistic methods and to leave aside all his
      theoretical and abstract misgivings concerning the “employment of
      farm labourers.” In the field of theory Skaldin argued like a
      typical member of the Manchester School, completely failing to realise
      both that his arguments were of just this character, and that they
      corresponded to the needs of Russia’s capitalist evolution. In the
      field of practice Engelhardt was compelled to act as a typical Mancunian,
      despite his theoretical protest against capitalism and his desire to
      believe that his fatherland was following a path of its own.

    
      Engelhardt did believe this, and it is this that induces us to call him a
      Narodnik. He had already clearly perceived the real trend of
      economic development in Russia, and sought to explain away the
      contradictions of this development.

 

      He endeavoured to prove that agricultural capitalism was impossible in
      Russia, that “there is no Knecht in our country”
      (p. 556)—though he himself refuted in the greatest detail the story
      that our workers are expensive, and himself showed how miserably he paid
      his cattleman, Pyotr, who with his family, after their keep, had only 6
      rubles a year Left “with which to buy salt, vegetable oil,
      clothing” (p. 10). “Yet even he is envied, and if I turned him
      off, fifty others would immediately be found eager to take his
      place” (p. 11). Speaking of the success of his farm, and of the
      skilful way his workers handle the plough, Engelhardt triumphantly
      exclaims: “And who are these ploughmen? Ignorant, unconscientious
      Russian peasants” (p. 225).

    
      Though his own farming experience and his exposure of the peasant’s
      individualism refuted all illusions concerning the “community
      spirit,” Engelhardt not only “believed” that the
      peasants could adopt an artel form of economy, but expressed the
      “conviction” that such would indeed be the case, and that we,
      the Russians, would accomplish this great feat and introduce a new mode of
      farming. “It is this that constitutes the exceptional character, the
      specific nature of our economy” (p. 349). Engelhardt the realist
      turns into Engelhardt the romanticist, who replaces the complete lack of
      “exceptional character” in his own methods of farming, and in
      the peasants’ farming methods as he observed them by
      “faith” in a future “exceptional character”! From
      this faith it is only a stone’s throw to the ultra-Narodnik features
      which—though very few—one finds in Engelhardt, to a narrow
      nationalism bordering on chauvinism (“We’ll give Europe a
      drubbing,”and “in Europe, too, the muzhik will be on
      our side” (p. 387)—said Engelhardt to a landlord with whom he
      was discussing the prospect of war), and even to idealisation of labour
      service! Yes, this selfsame Engelhardt who devoted so many superb. pages
      of his book to describing the downtrodden and degraded condition of the
      peasant who has taken a loan of money or grain to be paid off in work and
      is compelled to toil almost for nothing in the very worst conditions of
      personal

dependence[9]

—this

selfsame Engelhardt goes to the
      length

 

      of saying that “it would be a good thing if the doctor” (he
      was talking of the benefit of and need for doctors in the
      countryside. V. I.) “had a farm of his own, so that the muzhik could
      pay for the treatment with his labour” (p. 41). Comment is
      superfluous.

    
      —All in all, comparing the above-enumerated good features of
      Engelhardt’s outlook (i.e., those he has in common with the
      representatives of the “heritage” without any Narodnik tinge)
      with the bad (i.e., the Narodnik features), we have to admit that the
      former unquestionably predominate in the author of Letters from the
      Countryside, while the latter are an extraneous and accidental
      admixture, as it were, which has drifted in from without and is at odds
      with the general tone of his book.
    
 III 
 Has the “Heritage” Gained From Association With
      Narodism?
    

      “But what do you understand by Narodism?” the reader will
      probably ask. “The meaning attached to the concept
      ‘heritage’ was defined above, but no definition of the concept
      ‘Narodism’ has been given.”

    
      By Narodism we mean a system of views which comprises the following three
      features: 1) Belief that capitalism in Russia represents a
      deterioration, a retrogression. Hence the urge and desire to
      “retard,” “halt,” “stop the break-up”
      of the age-old foundations by capitalism, and similar reactionary
      cries. 2) Belief in the exceptional character of the Russian economic
      system in general, and of the peasantry, with its village community,
      artel, etc., in particular. It is not considered necessary to apply
      to Russian economic relationships the concepts elaborated by modern
      science concerning the different social classes and their conflicts. The
      village— community peasantry is regarded as something higher and

 

      better than capitalism; there is a disposition to idealise the
      “foundations.” The existence among the peasantry of
      contradictions characteristic of every commodity and capitalist economy is
      denied or slurred over; it is denied that any connection exists between
      these contradictions and their more developed form in capitalist industry
      and capitalist agriculture. 5) Disregard of the connection between the
      “intelligentsia” and the country’s legal and political
      institutions, on the one hand, arid the material interests of definite
      social classes, on the other. Denial of this connection, lack of a
      materialist explanation of these social factors, induces the belief that
      they represent a force capable of “dragging history along another
      line” (Mr. V. V.), of “diversion from the path”
      (Mr. N. —on, Mr. Yuzhakov, etc.), and so on.

    
      That is what we mean by “Narodism.” The reader will
      consequently see that we use this term in its broad sense, just as all the
      “Russian disciples” use it when opposing a whole system of
      views, and not individual representatives of this system. Among these
      individual representatives there arc differences, of course, and sometimes
      important ones. Nobody ignores these differences. But the aforementioned
      views are common to all the most diverse representatives of Narodism,
      from—well, Mr. Yuzov, let us say, to Mr. Mikhailovsky. To these
      objectionable features of their views, the Yuzovs, Sazonovs, V. V., etc.,
      add others, which are not shared, for instance, either by Mr. Mikhailovsky
      or by other contributors to the present-day Russkoye Bogatstvo.
      To deny these differences between the Narodniks in the narrow sense and
      the Narodniks in general would, of course, be wrong; but it would be
      wronger still to ignore the fact that the fundamental
      socio-economic views of all Narodniks coincide on the aforementioned major
      points. And since it is these fundamental views that the “Russian
      disciples” reject, and not only “deplorable deviations”
      from them in a worse direction, they are obviously fully entitled to
      employ the term “Narodism” in its wider meaning. Not only are
      they entitled to do so; they cannot do otherwise.

    
      Turning to the fundamental views of Narodism outlined above, the first
      thing we must note is that the “heritage”


has absolutely no part in them. There are a whole number of
      undeniable representatives and guardians of the “heritage” who
      have nothing in common with Narodism, who do not pose the question of
      capitalism at all, who do not believe in the exceptional character of
      Russia, the peasant community, etc., and who do not regard the
      intelligentsia and our legal and political institutions as a factor
      capable of “diversion from the path.” Above we named in
      illustration the editor and publisher of Vestnik

  Yevropy,[22] who might be
      accused of anything save violation of the traditions of the heritage. On
      the other hand, there are people whose views resemble the aforementioned
      fundamental principles of Narodism, yet who plainly and frankly
      “renounce the heritage”—we might mention, for example,
      the same Mr. Y. Abramov to whom Mr. Mikhailovsky refers, or Mr. Yuzov. The
      Narodism which the “Russian disciples” battle against did not
      even exist when the heritage was (to use a legal term)
      “bequeathed,” that is, in the sixties. Germs, rudiments of
      Narodism existed, of course, not only in the sixties, but in the forties
      and even

earlier[10]

—but

it is not the history
      of Narodism that concerns us here. We repeat, what is important for us is
      to establish that the “heritage” of the sixties, in the sense
      outlined above, has nothing in common with Narodism, i.e., that there is
      nothing in common in the substance of their views, that they pose
      different problems. There are guardians of the “heritage” who
      are not Narodniks, and there are Narodniks who “have renounced the
      heritage.” Of course, there are also Narodniks who guard the
      “heritage,” or who pretend to do so. That is why we speak of a
      connection between the heritage and Narodism. Let us see what has been the
      effect of this connection.

    
      First, Narodism made a big step forward compared with the
      heritage by posing for the attention of society problems which
      the guardians of the heritage were partly (in their time) not yet able to
      pose, or partly did not, and do not, pose because of their inherent
      narrowness of outlook. In posing these problems the Narodniks performed a
      great historical service, and it is quite natural and
      understandable,

 

      that, having offered a solution (whatever it maybe worth) for these
      problems, Narodism thereby occupied a foremost place among the
      progressive trends of Russian social thought.

    
      But the solution of these problems proposed by Narodism proved to be
      worthless, to be based on backward theories, long ago discarded in Western
      Europe, on a romantic and petty-bourgeois criticism of capitalism, on a
      disregard for the cardinal facts of Russian history and reality. So long
      as the development of capitalism in Russia and of its inherent
      contradictions was still very weak, this primitive criticism of capitalism
      could hold its ground. But Narodism is absolutely incapable of measuring
      up to the contemporary development of capitalism in Russia, the
      contemporary state of our knowledge of Russian economic history and
      reality, the contemporary demands made on sociological theory. Once
      progressive, as the first to pose the problem of capitalism, nowadays
      Narodism is a reactionary and harmful theory which misleads
      social thought and plays into the hands of stagnation and Asiatic
      backwardness. Today the reactionary character of its criticism of
      capitalism has even lent Narodism features that make it inferior
      to the outlook which confines itself to faithful guardianship of the

      heritage.[11]

      That this is so we shall now endeavour to prove by analysing each of the
      three basic features of the Narodnik outlook mentioned above.

    
      The first feature—the belief that in Russia capitalism represents a
      deterioration, a retrogression. Very soon after the problem of capitalism
      in Russia had been posed, it became clear that our economic development
      was capitalistic, and the Narodniks proclaimed this development a
      retrogression, a mistake, a deviation from the path supposedly prescribed
      by the whole history of the nation’s life, from the path supposedly
      hallowed by age-old foundations, and so on and so forth. The
      enlighteners’ ardent faith in this course of social development was
      replaced by distrust

 

      of it; historical optimism and cheerfulness were replaced by pessimism and
      dejection founded on the fact that the farther matters proceeded as they
      were proceeding, the harder and more difficult would it be to solve the
      problems raised by the new development; appeals were made to
      “retard” and “halt” this development; the theory
      was advanced that Russia’s backwardness was her good fortune, and so
      forth. All these features of the Narodnik outlook, far from having
      anything in common with the “heritage,” flatly contradict
      it. The belief that Russian. capitalism represents a “deviation from
      the path,” a deterioration, etc., leads to a misrepresentation of
      Russia’s whole economic evolution, to a misrepresentation of that
      “change-over” which is taking place before our eyes. Carried
      away by their desire to retard and stop the break-up of the age-old
      foundations by capitalism, the Narodniks display an amazing lack of
      historical tact, they forget that antecedent to this capitalism there was
      nothing but the same exploitation combined with countless forms of bondage
      and personal dependence, which burdened the position of the labourer,
      nothing but routine and stagnation in social production and, hence, in all
      spheres of social life. Contending against capitalism from their romantic,
      petty-bourgeois angle, the Narodniks throw all historical realism
      overboard and always compare the reality of capitalism with a
      fiction of the pre-capitalist order. The “heritage”
      of the sixties with their ardent faith in the progressive character of the
      existing course of social development, their relentless enmity directed
      wholly and exclusively against the relics of the past, their conviction
      that these relics had only to be swept clean away and everything would go
      splendidly—this ’heritage,” far from having any part in
      the aforementioned views of Narodism, runs directly counter to them.

    
      The second feature of Narodism is belief in Russia’s exceptionalism,
      idealisation of the peasantry, the village community, etc. The doctrine of
      Russia’s exceptionalism induced the Narodniks to seize upon
      out-dated West-European theories, prompted them to regard many of the
      achievements of West-European culture with amazing levity: the Narodniks
      reassured themselves with the thought that, if we lacked some of the
      features of civilised humanity, “we are

      destined,” on the other hand, to show the world new modes of
      economy, etc. Not only was the analysis of capitalism and all its
      manifestations given by progressive West-European thought not accepted in
      relation to Holy Russia; every effort was made to invent excuses for not
      drawing the same conclusions about Russian capitalism as were made
      regarding European capitalism. The Narodniks bowed and scraped to the
      authors of this analysis and—calmly continued to remain romanticists
      of the same sort as these authors had all their lives contended
      against. Again, this doctrine of Russia’s exceptionalism, which is
      shared by all the Narodniks, far from having anything in common with the
      “heritage,” runs directly counter to it. The
      “sixties,” on the contrary, desired to Europeanise Russia,
      believed that she should adopt the general European culture, were
      concerned to have the institutions of this culture transferred to our
      anything but exceptional soil. Any doctrine that teaches that Russia is
      exceptional is completely at variance with the spirit and the tradition of
      the sixties. Even more at variance with this tradition is Narodism’s
      idealisation and over-embellishment of the countryside. This false
      idealisation, which desired at all costs to see something specific in our
      rural system, something quite unlike the rural system in every other
      country in the period of pre-capitalist relations, is in naked
      contradiction to the traditions of the sober and realistic heritage. The
      wider and more deeply capitalism developed, the more distinctly did the
      countryside display the contradictions common to every
      commodity-capitalist society, the more and more glaringly did the
      antithesis stand out between the Narodniks’ honeyed talk about the
      peasant’s “community spirit,” “artel
      spirit,” etc., on the one hand, and the actual division of the
      peasantry into a rural bourgeoisie and a rural proletariat on the other;
      and the more rapidly did the Narodniks, who continued to look upon things
      with the eyes of the peasant, change from sentimental romanticists into
      ideologists of the petty bourgeoisie, because in modern society the small
      producer changes into a commodity producer. Their false idealisation of
      the countryside and romantic dreams about the “community
      spirit” led the Narodniks to adopt an extremely frivolous attitude
      towards the peasants’

 

      real needs arising from the existing course of economic development. In
      theory one might talk to one’s heart’s content about the
      strength of the foundations, but in practice every Narodnik sensed very
      well that the elimination of the relics of the past, the survivals of the
      pre-Reform system, which to this day bind our peasantry from head to foot,
      would open the way to precisely the capitalist course of development, and
      no other. Better stagnation than capitalist progress—this,
      essentially, is every Narodnik’s attitude to the countryside,
      although of course not every Narodnik would venture to say so frankly and
      bluntly, with the same forthrightness of a Mr. V. V. “Tied to their
      allotments and communities, and unable to apply their labour where
      it. would be more productive and of greater advantage to themselves, the
      peasants are, as it were, frozen in that congested, herd-like,
      unproductive form of life in which they emerged from serfdom.” That
      is how one of the representatives of the “heritage” saw it
      from his characteristic “enlightener’s”

standpoint.[23] “Better that
      the peasants remain frozen in their routine, patriarchal form of life,
      than clear the way for capitalism in the countryside”— that,
      essentially, is how every Narodnik sees it. Indeed, probably not a single
      Narodnik would venture to deny that social-estate exclusiveness of the
      peasant community, with its collective responsibility and its ban on the
      sale of land and on the right to refuse an allotment, stands in the
      sharpest contradiction to contemporary economic realities, to
      contemporary commodity-capitalist relations and their development. To deny
      this contradiction is impossible, but the whole point is that the
      Narodniks are mortally afraid of this presentation of the question, of
      this contrasting of the legal status of the peasantry with economic
      realities and the present course of economic development. The Narodnik is
      stubbornly determined to believe in a non-existent non-capitalist
      development which is a figment of his romantic imagination, and therefore
      ... and therefore he is prepared to retard the present development, which
      is proceeding along capitalist lines. The Narodnik’s attitude to
      such problems as the social-estate exclusiveness of the peasant community,
      collective responsibility, and the peasant’s right to sell and give
      up his allotment, is not only one of extreme caution

 

      and fear for the fate of the “foundations” (the foundations of
      routine and stagnation); more than this, the Narodnik falls so low that he
      even welcomes the police rule forbidding the peasants to sell land. To
      such a Narodnik, one might retort in the words of Engelhardt: “The
      muzhik is stupid, he cannot manage his own affairs. If nobody looks after
      him, he will burn down all the forests, kill off all the birds, denude the
      rivers of fish, ruin the land and himself die out.” Here the
      Narodnik quite definitely “renounces the heritage,” becomes a
      reactionary. And note that with the progress of economic development, this
      destruction.  But what about the foreign market? Do we deny that
      capitalism needs a foreign market? Of course not. But the question of a
      foreign market has absolutely nothing to do with the question of
      realisation, and the attempt to link them into one whole merely
      expresses the romantic wish to “retard” capitalism, and the
      romantic inability to think logically. The theory which has explained the
      question of realisation has proved this up to the hilt. The romanticist
      says: the capitalists cast allotment and community is an enormous
      restriction on his economic activity, makes it impossible for him to find
      a better employer, and compels him to sell his labour-power only to local
      purchasers, who invariably pay less and seek all sorts of ways and means
      of reducing him to bondage. Having surrendered to the sway of romantic
      dreaming and set himself the aim of maintaining and preserving the
      foundations despite the course of economic development, the Narodnik,
      without himself observing it, bad slipped down this inclined plane until
      he found himself side by side with the agrarian, who yearns with all his
      heart and soul for the preservation and consolidation of the
      “peasant’s tie with the land.” It is worth recalling,
      for example, that this social-estate exclusiveness of the peasant
      community has bred specific methods of hiring workers: factory and farm
      owners send out agents to the villages, especially those heavily in
      arrears, to hire labourers on the most advantageous terms. Fortunately,
      the development of agricultural capitalism, by breaking down the
      “settled state” of the proletarian (such is the effect of the
      so-called agricultural outside employments), is gradually substituting
      free hire for this form of bondage.
    


      Another, and perhaps no less striking corroboration of our contention that
      the present-day Narodnik theories are pernicious, is to be found in the
      common tendency among the Narodniks to idealise labour services.
      We have already given an example of how Engelhardt, consummating his
      Narodnik fall from grace, went so far as to say that “it would be a
      good thing” to develop labour services in the countryside!  We find
      the same thing in Mr. Yuzhakov’s famous project for agricultural
      gymnasia (Russkoye Bogatstvo, 1895,

No. 5).[12]

 In serious economic articles in the same journal,
      a fellow contributor of Engelhardt’s, Mr. V. V., indulged in similar
      idealisation when he declared that the peasant had scored a victory over
      the landlord, who had supposedly wanted to introduce capitalism; but the
      whole trouble was that the peasant undertook to cultivate the
      landlord’s land in return for land received from him “on
      lease”—in other words, was restoring the very same mode of
      economy as existed under serfdom. These are some of the most glaring
      illustrations of the Narodniks’ reactionary attitude to problems
      concerning our agriculture. In less glaring form, you will find this idea
      advocated by every Narodnik. Every Narodnik says that capitalism in our
      agriculture is pernicious and dangerous, because capitalism, you see,
      substitutes the farm labourer for the independent peasant. The reality of
      capitalism (the “farm labourer”) is contrasted to the fiction
      of the “independent” peasant: and this fiction is based on the
      peasant ownership of means of production in the pre-capitalist era, the
      fact being modestly ignored that the peasant has to pay double their value
      for these means of production; that these means of production serve for
      the performance of labour service; that the living standard of this
      “independent” peasant is so low that in any capitalist country
      he would be classed as a pauper; and that added to the hopeless poverty
      and intellectual inertness of this “independent” peasant is
      the personal dependence that inevitably accompanies pre-capitalist forms
      of economy.

    
      The third characteristic feature of Narodism—disregard of the
      connection between the “intelligentsia” and the

 

      country’s legal and political institutions, on the one hand, and the
      material interests of definite social classes, on the other—is bound
      up indissolubly with the previous ones: only this unrealistic attitude to
      sociological problems could have bred the doctrine that Russian capitalism
      is a “mistake,” and that “diversion from the path”
      is possible. This Narodnik view, too, bears no relation to the
      “heritage” and traditions of the sixties; on the contrary, it
      runs directly counter to these traditions. A natural corollary to
      this view is the Narodniks’ attitude to the numerous survivals of
      the pre-Reform reglementation of Russian life, an attitude which the
      representatives of the “heritage” could not possibly have
      shared. To illustrate this attitude, we shall take the liberty of
      borrowing the excellent remarks of Mr. V. Ivanov in his article “A
      Shabby Fabrication” (Novoye Slovo, September 1897). The
      author refers to Mr. Boborykin’s novel A Different Way, and
      exposes his misconception of the dispute between the Narodniks and the
      “disciples.” Mr. Boborykin makes his hero, a Narodnik,
      reproach the “disciples” for supposedly dreaming of “a
      barrack regime with the intolerable despotism of reglementation.”
      Mr. V. Ivanov observes in this connection that:

    
      “Far from saying that the ‘dream’ of their opponents was
      the intolerable despotism of ‘reglementation,’ they”
      (the Narodniks) “cannot and will not say so as long as they
      remain Narodniks. The substance of their dispute with the
      ‘economic materialists’ in this respect is that, in
      the opinion of the Narodniks, the remaining survivals of the old
      reglementation may serve as the basis for its further development. The
      intolerableness of the old reglementation is veiled from their eyes, on
      the one hand, by their conviction that the very ‘peasant soul
      (single and indivisible) is evolving’ towards reglementation, and,
      on the other, by their belief in the existing or coming moral beauty of
      the ‘intelligentsia,’ ‘society,’ or the
      ‘leading classes’ generally. They accuse the economic
      materialists of being infatuated not with ‘reglementation,’
      but, on the contrary, with the West-European system, which is based on
      freedom from reglementation. And the economic materialists really do assen
      that the survivals of the old reglementation, which

 

      sprang from a natural form of economy, are daily becoming more
      ‘intolerable’ in a country that has passed over to a money
      economy, entailing countless changes both in the actual status and in the
      menial and moral complexion of the various sections of its
      population. They are therefore convinced that the conditions necessary for
      the rise of a new and beneficial ‘reglementation’ of the
      country’s economic life cannot develop out of the survivals of a
      reglementation which was adapted to a natural economy and serfdom, and can
      only evolve in such an atmosphere of wide and comprehensive freedom from
      the old reglementation as exists in the advanced countries of Western
      Europe and America. That is how matters stand with the question of
      ‘reglementation’ in the dispute between the Narodniks and
      their opponents” (pp. 11-12, loc. cit.). This attitude of the
      Narodniks to “the survivals of the old reglementation is, perhaps,
      their most flagrant departure from the traditions of the
      “heritage.” The representatives of this heritage were, as we
      have seen, distinguished by their ineradicable and fierce aversion for
      every survival of the old reglementation. Consequently, in this respect
      the “disciples” are incomparably closer to the
      “traditions” and “heritage” of the sixties than
      the Narodniks are.

    
      In addition to the highly important error of the Narodniks mentioned
      above, their lack of sociological realism impels them to a specific manner
      of thinking and reasoning about social affairs and problems which might be
      called narrow intellectual self-conceit or, perhaps, the bureaucratic
      mentality. The Narodnik is always dilating on the path “we”
      should choose for our country, the misfortunes that would arise if
      “we” directed the country along such-and-such a path, the
      prospects “we” could ensure ourselves if we avoided the
      dangers of the path old Europe has taken, if- we “take what is
      good” both from Europe and from our ancient village-community
      system, and so on and so forth. Hence the Narodnik’s complete
      distrust and contempt for the independent trends of the various social
      classes which are shaping history in accordance with their own
      interests. Hence the amazing levity with which the Narodnik (forgetting
      the conditions surrounding him) advances all sorts of social projects,
      from the “organisation of agricultural

 

      labour” to the “communalisation of production” through
      the good offices of our “society.” “Mit der
      Gründlichkeit der geschichtlichen Action wird also der Umfang der Masse
      zunehmen, deren Action sie

ist”[13]

—these

words express one of the profoundest
      and most important precepts of that historico-philosophical theory which
      our Narodniks will not and cannot understand. As man’s
      history-making activity grows broader and deeper, the size of that mass of
      the population which is the conscious maker of history is bound to
      increase. The Narodnik, however, always regarded the population in
      general, and the working population in particular, as the object of this
      or that more or less sensible measure, as something to be directed along
      this or that path, and never regarded the various classes of the
      population as independent history-makers on the existing path, never asked
      which conditions of the present path might stimulate (or, on the contrary,
      paralyse) the independent and conscious activity of these history-makers.

    
      And so, although Narodism, by posing the question of capitalism
      in Russia, made a big step forward compared with the
      “heritage” of the enlighteners, the solution of the
      question it offered has proved so unsatisfactory, because of its
      petty-bourgeois outlook and sentimental criticism of capitalism, that on a
      number of cardinal questions of social life it lags behind the
      “enlighteners.” Narodism’s association with the heritage
      and traditions of our enlighteners has proved in the end to be a
      drawback: the new questions with which Russian social thought has
      been confronted by Russia’s post-Reform economic development,
      Narodism has not solved, confining itself to sentimental and reactionary
      lamentations over them; while Narodnik romanticism has obscured the old
      questions already posed by the enlighteners, thus retarding their full
      solution.
    

IV
The “Enlighteners,” the Narodniks,
      and the “Disciples”

      We may now sum up the results of our comparisons. Let us endeavour to give
      a brief description of the relationship in which each of the trends of
      social thought enumerated in the sub-title stands to the others.

    
      The enlightener believes in the present course of social development,
      because he fails to observe its inherent contradictions. The Narodnik
      fears the present course of social development, because he is already
      aware of these contradictions. The “disciple” believes in the
      present course of social development, because he sees the only earnest of
      a better future in the full development of these contradictions. The first
      and last trends therefore strive to support, accelerate, facilitate
      development along the present path, to remove all obstacles which hamper
      this development and retard it. Narodism, on the contrary, strives to
      retard and halt this development, is afraid of abolishing certain
      obstacles to the development of capitalism. The first and last trends are
      distinguished by what may be called historical optimism: the farther and
      the quicker things go as they are, the better it will be. Narodism, on the
      contrary, naturally tends to historical pessimism: the farther things go
      as they are, the worse it will be. The “enlighteners” never
      posed questions concerning the character of post-Reform development and
      confined themselves exclusively to warring against the survivals of the
      pre-Reform system, to the negative task of clearing the way for a European
      type of development in Russia. Narodism posed the question of capitalism
      in Russia, but answered it in the sense that capitalism is reactionary,
      and therefore could not wholly accept the heritage of the enlighteners:
      the Narodniks always warred against people who in general strove to
      Europeanise Russia from the standpoint of a “single
      civilisation”; warred against them not only because they, the
      Narodniks, could not confine themselves to these people’s ideals
      (such a war would have been lust), but because they did not want to go so
      far in the development of this, i.e., capitalist, civilisation. The
      ‘disciples”

 

      answer the question of capitalism in Russia in the sense that it is
      progressive, and they therefore not only can, but must, accept the
      heritage of the enlighteners in its entirety, supplementing it with an
      analysis of the contradictions of capitalism from the standpoint of the
      property-less producers. The enlighteners did not single out any one class
      of the population for special attention; they not only spoke of the people
      in general, but even of the nation in general. The Narodniks were desirous
      of representing the interests of labour, but they did not point to any
      definite groups in the contemporary economic system; actually, they always
      took the standpoint of the small producer, whom capitalism converts into a
      commodity producer. The “disciples” not only take the
      interests of labour as their criterion, but in doing so point to quite
      definite economic groups in the capitalist economy, namely, the
      propertyless producers. By the nature of their aims, the first and last
      trends correspond to the interests of the classes which are created and
      developed by capitalism; Narodism, by its nature, corresponds to the
      interests of the class of small producers, the petty bourgeoisie, which
      occupies an intermediate position among the classes of contemporary
      society. Consequently, Narodism’s contradictory attitude to the
      “heritage” is not accidental, but is a necessary result of the
      very nature of the Narodnik views: we have seen that one of the basic
      features of the enlighteners’ views was the ardent desire to
      Europeanise Russia, but the Narodniks cannot possibly share this desire
      fully without ceasing to be Narodniks.

    
      We have in the end arrived at the conclusion which we have repeatedly
      indicated above in particular instances namely, that the disciples are
      much more consistent and faithful guardians of the heritage than the
      Narodniks As far from renouncing the heritage, they consider it one of
      their principal duties to refute the romantic and petty-bourgeois fears
      which induce the Narodniks on very many and very important points to
      reject the European ideals of the enlighteners. But it goes without saying
      that the “disciples” do not guard the heritage in the way an
      archivist guards an old document. Guarding the heritage does not mean
      confining oneself to the heritage, and the ‘disciples” add to
      their defence

 

      of the general ideals of Europeanism an analysis of the contradictions
      implicit in our capitalist development, and an assessment of this
      development from the specific standpoint indicated above.  
V
Mr. Mikhailovsky on the “Disciples”’
      Renunciation of the Heritage

      Let us, in conclusion, return to Mr. Mikhailovsky and examine his
      statements on the subject under consideration. Not only does
      Mr. Mikhailovsky declare that these people (the disciples) “do not
      acknowledge any continuity with the past and emphatically renounce the
      heritage” (loc. cit., 179); he also affirms that “they”
      (together with other persons of the most diverse trends, up to and
      including Mr. Abramov, Mr. Volynsky and Mr. Rozanov) “hurl
      themselves against the heritage with the greatest fury” (180). To
      which heritage is Mr. Mikhailovsky referring? To the heritage of the
      sixties and seventies, the heritage which Moskovskiye Vedomosti
      solemnly renounced and renounces (178).

    
      We have already said that if it is a question of the
      “heritage” that has fallen to the people of today, then one
      must distinguish between two heritages: one is the heritage of
      the enlighteners in general, of the people who were absolutely hostile to
      the whole pre-Reform order, who stood for European ideals and for the
      interests of the broad mass of the population. The other heritage is
      Narodism. We have already shown that to confuse these two different things
      would be a gross error, for everyone knows that there have been, and still
      are, people who guard the “traditions of the sixties” but have
      nothing in common with Narodism. All Mr. Mikhailovsky’s observations
      are founded wholly and exclusively upon a confusion of these totally
      different heritages. And since Mr. Mikhailovsky must be aware of this
      difference, his sally is not only absurd, but definitely slanderous. Did
      Moskovskiye Vedomosti hurl itself against Narodism specifically?
      Not at all: it hurled itself no less, if not more, against the
      enlighteners in general, and


Vestnik Yevropy, which absolutely abhors Narodism, is in its eyes
      no less an enemy than the Narodnik Russkoye Bogatstvo. Moskovskiye
      Vedomosti would, of course, disagree on many points with the
      Narodniks who most emphatically renounce the heritage—Yuzov, for
      example—but it would hardly hurl itself against him with fury, and
      in any case, it would praise him for that which distinguishes him from the
      Narodniks who desire to guard the heritage. Did Mr. Abramov or
      Mr. Volynsky hurl himself against Narodism?  Not at all. The former is
      himself a Narodnik; and both hurled themselves against the enlighteners in
      general. Did the “Russian disciples” hurl themselves against
      the Russian enlighteners? Did they ever renounce the heritage which
      enjoins unreserved hostility to the pre-Reform way of life and its
      survivals? Far from hurling themselves against it, they denounced the
      Narodniks for desiring to maintain some of these survivals out of a
      petty-bourgeois fear of capitalism. Did they ever hurl themselves against
      the heritage which enjoins European ideals generally? Far from hurling
      themselves against it, they denounced the Narodniks because on many very
      important issues, instead of espousing general European ideals, they
      concoct the most arrant nonsense about Russia’s exceptional
      character. Did they ever hurl themselves against the heritage which
      enjoins concern for the interests of the labouring masses of the
      population? Far from hurling themselves against it, they denounced the
      Narodniks because their concern for these interests is inconsistent (owing
      to their confirmed tendency to lump together the peasant bourgeoisie and
      the rural proletariat); because the value of their concern is diminished
      by their habit of dreaming of what might be, instead of turning their
      attention to what is; because their concern is extremely circumscribed,
      since they have never been able properly to appraise the conditions
      (economic and other) which make it easier or harder for these people to
      care for their own interests themselves.

    
      Mr. Mikhailovsky may not agree with these denunciations—being a
      Narodnik, he certainly will not agree with them— but to assert that
      certain people “furiously” attack the ‘heritage of the
      sixties and the seventies,” when, actually, they
      “furiously” attack only Narodism, and attack it for having

 

      failed to solve the new problems posed by post-Reform history in the
      spirit of this heritage and without contradicting it—such an
      assertion is a direct misrepresentation of the truth.

    
      Mr. Mikhailovsky most amusingly complains that the “disciples”
      readily confuse “us” (i.e., the Russkoye Bogatstvo
      writers) with the “Narodniks” and other persons who have no
      connection with Russkoye Bogatstvo’ (p. 180). This curious
      attempt at dissociation from the “Narodniks,” while at the
      same time preserving all the basic views of Narodism, can evoke nothing
      but laughter. Everyone knows that all the “Russian disciples”
      employ the words “Narodnik” and “Narodism” in the
      broad sense. That there are quite a number of different shades among the
      Narodniks has not been forgotten or denied by anybody: in their books
      neither P. Struve nor N. Beltov, for instance, “confused”
      Mr. N. Mikhailovsky with Mr. V. V., or even for that matter with
      Mr. Yuzhakov; that is, they did not gloss over the differences between
      them, or ascribe the views of one to the other. P. B. Struve even
      expressly drew attention to the difference between Mr. Yuzhakov’s
      views and those of Mr. Mikhailovsky. It is one thing to confuse different
      views; it is another to generalise and class in one category writers who,
      despite their differences on many questions, are at one on the fundamental
      and principal points, points which the “disciples”
      oppose. What is important for the “disciple” is not to show
      the worthlessness of the views which distinguish, for instance, a
      Mr. Yuzov from the other Narodniks, but to refute the views common to
      Mr. Yuzov and Mr. Mikhailovsky and all the Narodniks in
      general—that is, their attitude to Russia’s capitalist
      evolution, their discussion of economic and social problems from the
      standpoint of the small producer, their failure to understand social (or
      historical) materialism. These features are the common property
      of a whole trend of social thought which has played a big historical
      role. This broad trend contains the most varied shades: right and left
      flanks, people who have sunk to nationalism and anti-semitism, etc., and
      people who are not guilty of these things; people who have been
      contemptuous of many of the behests of the “heritage,” and
      people who have striven their utmost (that is, the utmost possible to a
      Narodnik) to guard these behests. Not one of the “Russian

 

      disciples” has denied these differences of shade; not one of them
      has Mr. Mikhailovsky been able to convict of ascribing the views of a
      Narodnik of one shade to a Narodnik of another shade. But since we oppose
      the fundamental views common to all these different shades, why
      should we be expected to speak of partial differences within the general
      trend? That, surely, is an absolutely senseless demand! Long before the
      appearance of the “disciples,” our literature had noted many
      times that writers who were far from unanimous on everything held common
      views on Russia’n capitalism, the peasant “community,”
      the almighty power of so-called “society,” and not only noted
      it, but praised it as a happy peculiarity of Russia. Again, in its broad
      sense, the term “Narodism” was employed in our literature long
      before the appearance of the “disciples.” Not only did
      Mr. Mikhailovsky contribute for many years to a journal along with the
      “Narodnik” (in the narrow sense) Mr. V. V., but the outlook of
      both bore the same fundamental features mentioned above. Though, both in
      the eighties and the nineties, he objected to some of Mr. V. V.’s
      conclusions, and denied the correctness of his excursions into the field
      of abstract sociology, Mr. Mikhailovsky, both in the eighties and the
      nineties, made the reservation that his criticism was not directed against
      Mr. V. V.’s economic works, that he was at one with his basic views
      on Russian capitalism. Consequently, if the pillars of Russkoye
      Bogatstvo, who have done so much to develop, reinforce and
      disseminate the views of Narodism (in the broad sense), now think that
      they can escape the criticism of the “Russian disciples”
      simply by declaring that they are not “Narodniks” (in the
      narrow sense), that they constitute a quite specific “ethico-social
      school”—such subterfuges, of course, can only expose to
      justified ridicule people who are so brave and at the same time so
      diplomatic.

    
      On p. 182 of his article, Mr. Mikhailovsky also levels the following
      phenomenal argument against the “disciples.” Mr. Kamensky
      venomously attacks the

Narodniks[24]; that, you see, “indicates that he is
      angry, which he is not entitled (sic!!) to be. We, the ‘subjective
      oldsters,’ as well as the ‘subjective youngsters, can permit
      ourselves this weakness without being guilty of

      self-contradiction, But 

      the representatives

 

      of a doctrine which ‘prides itself on its inexorable
      objectivity’ “ (the expression of one of the
      “disciples”) “are in a different position.”

    
      What is this?! If people insist that views on social phenomena must be
      based upon an inexorably objective analysis of realities and the real
      course of development, then it follows that they are not entitled to be
      angry?! Why, this is utter twaddle, the sheer gibberish! Have you not
      heard, Mr. Mikhailovsky, that the famous work on Capital is
      considered to be one of the finest specimens of inexorable objectivity in
      the investigation of social phenomena? It is precisely the inexorable
      objectivity of the work that is regarded by many scientists and economists
      as its principal and basic defect. Yet rarely will you find in a
      scientific work so much “feeling,” so much heated and
      passionate polemical attacks on representatives of backward views, on
      representatives of the social classes which, in the author’s
      convinced opinion, are hampering social development. A writer who shows
      with inexorable objectivity that the opinions of Proudhon, say, are a
      natural, understandable and inevitable reflexion of the views and
      sentiments of the French petit bourgeois, nevertheless “hurls
      himself” against that ideologist of the petty bourgeoisie with
      tremendous passion and fiery wrath. Does Mr. Mikhailovsky believe that
      Marx is here guilty of “self-contradiction”? If a certain
      doctrine demands of everyone taking part in public life an inexorably
      objective analysis of realities and of the relationships between the
      various classes arising from these realities, by what miracle can the
      conclusion be drawn from this that they must not sympathise, are
      “not entitled” to sympathise with one or another class? It is
      ridiculous in this connection even to talk of duty, for no living person
      can help taking the side of one class or another (once he has
      understood their interrelationships), can help rejoicing at the successes
      of that class and being disappointed by its failures, can help being
      angered by those who are hostile to that class, who hamper its development
      by disseminating backward views, and so on and so
      forth. Mr. Mikhailovsky’s nonsensical sally only shows that he still
      fails to grasp the very elementary distinction between determinism and
      fatalism.
    


      “‘Capital is coming’!—that is certain,”
      writes Mr. Mikhailovsky,—”but (sic) the question is, how shall
      we greet it” (p. 189).

    
      Mr. Mikhailovsky makes a great discovery, points to a
      “question” to which the “Russian disciples” have
      evidently given no thought whatever! As though it were not on this
      question that the “Russian disciples” have parted ways with
      the Narodniks! One can “greet” the capitalism developing in
      Russia only in two ways: one can regard it either as progressive, or as
      retrogressive; either as a step forward on the right road, or as a
      deviation from the true path; one can assess it either from the standpoint
      of the class of small producers which capitalism destroys, or from the
      standpoint of the class of propertyless producers which capitalism
      creates. There is no middle

way.[14]

 Consequently, if Mr. Mikhailovsky denies the
      correctness of the attitude to capitalism which the
      “disciples” insist on, it means that he accepts the Narodnik
      attitude which he has many a time expressed quite definitely in his
      earlier articles. He has not made any additions or amendments to his old
      views on this subject, and continues to remain a Narodnik. But nothing of
      the kind! He is not a Narodnik, heaven forbid He is a representative of an
      “ethico-sociological school.”...

    
      “Let no one talk,” Mr. Mikhailovsky continues, “of those
      future (??) benefits which the further development of capitalism will (?)
      bring.”

    
      Mr. Mikhailovsky is no Narodnik. He only reiterates all the
      Narodniks’ errors and fallacious methods of argument. How many times
      have the Narodniks been told that this talk of the “future” is
      wrong, that it is not a question of “future,” but of actual
      progressive changes already taking place in the pre-capitalist
      relationships—changes which the development of capitalism in Russia
      is bringing (not, will bring). By transplanting the question to the
      “future,”

 

      Mr. Mikhailovsky in point of fact takes for granted the very assertions
      which the ‘disciples” contest. He takes it for granted that in
      reality, in what is taking place under our eyes, the development of
      capitalism is not bringing any progressive changes into the old
      socio-economic relations. This is what constitutes the Narodnik view, and
      it is against this that the “Russian disciples” argue and
      demonstrate that the contrary is true. There is not a book put out by the
      “Russian disciples” which does not affirm and demonstrate that
      the replacement of labour service by wage-labour in agriculture, and the
      replacement of what is called “handicraft” industry by factory
      industry, is a real phenomenon which is taking place (and, moreover, at a
      tremendous speed) now, under our eyes, and not merely “in the
      future”; that this change is in all respects progressive, that it is
      breaking down routine, disunited, small-scale hand production which has
      been immobile and stagnant for ages; that it is increasing the
      productivity of social labour, and thereby creating the possibility of
      higher living standards for the working man; that it is also creating the
      conditions which convert this possibility into a necessity—namely,
      by converting the “settled proletarian” lost in the
      “backwoods,” settled physically and morally, into a mobile
      proletarian, and by converting Asiatic forms of labour, with their
      infinitely developed bondage and diverse forms of personal dependence,
      into European forms of labour; that “the European manner of thought
      and feeling is no less necessary (note, necessary. V. I.) for the
      effective utilisation of machines than steam, coal,

techniques,”[15]

      etc. All this, we repeat, is affirmed and demonstrated by every
      “disciple,” but, presumably, does not apply to
      Mr. Mikhailovsky “and company”; all this is only written
      against “Narodniks” who are “not connected” with
      Russkoye Bogatstvo. Russkoye Bogatstvo, you see, is an
      “ethico-sociological school,” whose essence is that it serves
      up the old rubbish under a new guise.

    
      As we observed above, the purpose of this article is to refute the
      allegation so widespread ‘in the liberal-Narodnik press that the
      “Russian disciples” abjure the “heritage,”

 

      break with the best traditions of the best section of Russian society, and
      so forth. It is not without interest to observe that, in reiterating these
      hackneyed phrases, Mr. Mikhailovsky in point of fact says exactly the same
      thing as was said much earlier and much more emphatically by a
      “Narodnik” “not connected” with Russkoye
      Bogatstvo—Mr. V. V. Are you familiar, dear reader, with the
      articles which this writer contributed to

Nedelya[25] three years ago, at
      the close of 1894, in reply to P. B. Struve’s book? If you are not,
      I must confess that, in my opinion, you have lost absolutely nothing. The
      basic idea of these articles, is that the “Russian disciples”
      are breaking the democratic thread which runs through all the progressive
      trends of Russian social thought. Is this not exactly what
      Mr. Mikhailovsky says, only in somewhat different terms, when he accuses
      the “disciples” of renouncing the “heritage,”
      against which Moskovskiye Vedomosti hurls itself with fury?
      Actually, as we have seen, the inventors of this allegation blame others
      for their own sins when they assert that the
      “disciples”’ irrevocable break with Narodism
      signifies a break with the best traditions of the best section of Russian
      society. Is it not the other way round, sirs? Does not such a break
      signify that these best traditions are being purged of Narodism?

[4]
      Skaldin very circumstantially demonstrates the correctness not only of the
      first, but also of the second part of this definition (proletarian). He
      devotes much space in his essays to a description of the peasants’
      dependent status and their poverty, to a description of the hard lot of
      the agricultural labourer, to a “description of the 1868
      famine” (heading of the fifth essay) and of the diverse forms of
      peasant bondage and humiliation. There were people in the sixties, as
      there are in the nineties, who sought to hush up or deny the existence of
      famine. Skaldin passionately opposes them. It would of course be
      superfluous to give detailed excerpts on this point.
    —Lenin

[5]
      And vice versa, all the progressive practical measures that we find the
      Narodniks advocating are, in substance, fully bourgeois,

  

that is,
      they conduce to the capitalist line of development, and no other. Only
      petty-bourgeois people could concoct the theory that extension of peasant
      land tenure, tax reduction, resettlement, credits, technical progress,
      marketing arrangements and suchlike measures would serve the interests of
      so-called “people’s production.”
    —Lenin

[6]
      It might perhaps be objected that Skaldin is not typical of the sixties
      because of his hostility to the village community and because of his
      tone. But it is not a question of the village community alone. It is a
      question of the views common to all the enlighteners, which Skaldin
      shared. As to his tone, it really is not typical in its calm
      reasonableness, moderation, emphasis on gradualness, etc. It was not
      without reason that Engels called Skaldin a

      Liberalkoservatir.[26] However, the selection of a
      representative of
      the heritage with a more typical tone would, firstly, he inconvenient for
      various reasons, and might, secondly, give rise to misunderstanding when
      comparing him with the present-day

Narodniks.[27] Because of the very character of our
      task, the tone (contrary to the proverb) does not make the
      music, and Skaldin’s untypical tone serves to bring out his
      “music,” that is, the substance of his views, more
      distinctly. And it is only the substance that interests us. It is only on
      the basis of the substance of writers’ views (and not of their tone)
      that we intend to draw the comparison between the representatives of the
      heritage and the present-day Narodniks.

      Incidentally, this would be not only extremely interesting and

      answers and opinions of numerous proprietors, who all too often are
      biassed and ill-informed, have not developed a consistent outlook or
      intelligently thought out their views—why not trust the observations
      gathered for a full eleven years by a marl with splendid powers of
      observation, who is unquestionably sincere and has made a superb study of
      what he is talking about.

Otechestvenniye Zapiski (Fatherland Notes)—a
      literary-political magazine that began publication in St. Petersburg in
      1820. From 1839 it became the best progressive journal of its day. Among
      its contributors were V. G. Belinsky, A. I. Herzen, T. N. Granevaky, and
      N. P. Ogaryov. Following Beiinsky’s departure from the editorial
      board in 1846, the importance of Otechestvenniye Zapiski began to
      diminish. In 1868 the journal came under the direction of N. A. Nekrasov
      and N. Y. Saltykov-Shchedrln. This marked the onset of a period in which
      the journal flourished anew, gathering around itself the revolutionary
      democratic intellectuals of Russia. When Nekrasov died (in 1877), the
      Narodniks gained dominant influence in the journal.

    
Otechestvenniye Zapiski was continually harassed by the
      censors, and in April 1834 was closed down by the tsarist
      government.

    


[18]
      The “peasant Reform” of 1861, which abolished serfdom
      In Russia, was effected by the tsarist government in the interests of the
      serf owning landlords. The Reform was made necessary by the entire course
      of Russia’s economic development and by the growth of a mass
      movement among the peasantry against feudal exploitation. In

 

its form the
      ‘peasant Reform” was feudal, but the force of economic
      development that had drawn Russia on to the capitalist path gave the
      feudal form a capitalist content, and this content became “the more
      evident the less land was filched from the peasants, the mere
      fully the land of the peasants was separated from that of the
      landlords, the less the tribute” (i.e., redemption) “paid to
      the feudalists” (“The ‘Peasant Reform’ and
      proletarian-Peasant Revolution.” See present edition, Vol. 17). The
      “peasant Reform marked a step towards Russia’s transformation
      into a bourgeois monarchy. On February 19, 1861, Alexander II signed a
      Manifesto and Regulations for the peasants, who had been freed from feudal
      dependence. In all, 22,500,000 serfs, formerly belonging to landowners,
      were “emancipated.” Landed proprietorship, however,
      remained. The peasants’ lands were declared the property of the
      landlords. The peasant could only get a land allotment according to the
      standard established by law (and even then by agreement with the
      landlord), and had to redeem it, that is, pay for it. The peasants made
      their redemption payments to the tsarist government, that had paid the
      established sums to the landlords. Approximate estimates show that after
      the Reform, the nobility possessed 71,500,000 dessiatines of land and the
      peasants 83,700,000 dessiatines. The Reform enabled the landlords to cut
      off and appropriate one-fifth or even two-fifths of the lands formerly
      cultivated by the peasants.

    
      The Reform merely undermined, but did not abolish, the old

      corvée

      system of farming. The landlords secured possession of the best parts of
      the peasants’ allotments (the ‘cut-off lands,” woods,
      meadows, watering places, grazing grounds, and so on), without which the
      peasants could not engage in independent farming. Until the redemption
      arrangements were completed the peasants were considered to be
      “temporarily bound,” and rendered services to the landlord in
      the shape of quit-rent or corvèe service.

    
      The Russian revolutionary democrats, headed by N. G. Chernyshevsky,
      criticised the “peasant Reform” for its feudal
      character. V. I. Lenin called the “peasant Reform” of 1861 the
      first mass act of violence against the peasantry in the interests of
      nascent capitalism in agriculture—the landlords were “clearing
      the estates” for capitalism.

    
      For material ‘on the 1861 Reform, see F. Engels’ article
      “Socialism in Germany” (Die Neue Zeit, 1g. X,
      Ed. 1,1891, H. 19) and VI. Lenin’s “The Fiftieth Anniversary
      of the downfall of Serfdom,” “The Jubilee,” “The
      ‘Peasant Reform’ and Proletarian-Peasant Revolution”
      (see present edition, Vol. 47).

    


[19]
      The Regulations of February 19,1861, were legislative acts on the
      abolition of serfdom in Russia.

[27]
      When speaking of the ideological “heritage” of the 1860s Lenin
      was compelled, for censorship reasons, to make reference to
      Skaldin. Actually Lenin considered Chernyshevsky to be the principal
      representative of this “heritage.” In a letter to
      A. N. Potresov dated January 26, 1899, from exile in Siberia, Lenin wrote:
      “... nowhere, however, do I suggest accepting the heritage from
      Skaldin. There can be no doubt that it should be accepted from other
      people. I think that the footnote on p. 237” (p. 505 of the present
      volume), “in which I had Chernyshevsky in mind and explained why it
      was not convenient to take him for purposes of comparison, will make it
      easier for me to defend myself (against possible attacks by
      opponents).”

[21]
      Cycle cultivation—an enslaving form of labour-service rendered to
      the landlord by the peasant as rental for land obtained from him. The
      landlord lent the peasant land or made him a loan in cash or kind for
      which the peasant undertook to cultivate a “cycle” using his
      own implements and draught animals: this meant cultivating one dessialine
      of spring crops and one of winter crops, occasionally supplemented by
      reaping a dessiatine of crops.

    


[22]
Vestnik Yevropy (European Messenger)—a monthly
      historico-political and literary magazine, bourgeois-liberal in
      trend. Appeared in St. Petersburg from 1866 to 1918. The magazine
      published articles directed against the revolutionary Marxists. The
      magazine’s editor and publisher until 1908 was M. M. Stasyulevich.

      matters,” i.e., appealed to the intelligentsia to abstain from
      revolutionary struggle and to engage in “cultural activity.”

  Lenin’s work What Is To Be Done? was written at the end of
  1901 and early in 1902. In “Where To Begin”, published in Iskra,
  No. 4 (May 1901), Lenin said that the article represented “a skeleton plan
  to be developed in greater detail in a pamphlet now in preparation for
  print”.  


  Lenin began the actual writing of the book in the autumn of 1901. In
  his “Preface to the Pamphlet Documents of the ‘Unity’
  Conference”, written in November 1901, Lenin said that the book was
  in preparation “to be published in the near future”. In December Lenin
  published (in Iskra, No. 12) his article “A Talk with Defenders
  of Economism”, which he later called a conspectus of What Is To Be
  Done? He wrote the Preface to the book in February 1902 and early in
  March the book was published by Dietz in Stuttgart. An announcement of its
  publication was printed in Iskra, No. 18, March 10, 1902.  


  In republishing the book in 1907 as part of the collection Twelve
  Years, Lenin omitted Section A of Chapter V, “Who Was Offended by the
  Article ‘Where To Begin,’” stating in the Preface that the book
  was being published with slight abridgements, representing the omission
  solely of details of the organisational relationships and minor polemical
  remarks. Lenin added five footnotes to the new edition.  


  The text of this volume is that of the 1902 edition, verified with the
  1907 edition.

  Lenin devoted several months to the writing of One Step Forward
      Two Steps Back (The Crisis in Our Party), making a careful
      study of the minutes and resolutions of the Second Party
      Congress, of the speeches of each of the delegates and the
      political groupings at the Congress, and of the Central
      Committee and Party Council documents.
    

      The book evoked fury among the Mensheviks. Plekhanov demanded
      that the Central Committee disavow it. The conciliators on the
      Central Committee tried to prevent its publication and
      circulation.
    

      Though published abroad, One Step Forward, Two Steps
      Back had a wide circulation among advanced workers in
      Russia. Copies of the book were found during arrests and
      house-searches in Moscow St. Petersburg, Riga, Saratov, Tula,
      Orel, Ufa, Perm, Kostroma Shchigri, Shavli (Kovno Gubernia), and
      elsewhere. Lenin included the book in the Twelvee Years
      collection published in 1907 (the date on the title-page is
      1908), omitting sections J, K, L, M, O, and P making
      abridgements in other sections, and adding a few explanatory
      notes.
    

      The present edition contains the full text as originally
      published in 1904 and all the additions made by the author in
      1907.

Geneva, Wednesday, January 25 (12)


Events of the greatest historical importance are developing in Russia. The
proletariat has risen against tsarism. The proletariat was driven to revolt by
the government. There can hardly be any doubt now that the government
deliberately allowed the strike movement to develop and a wide demonstration to
be started more or less without hindrance in order to bring matters to a point
where military force could be used. Its manoeuvre was successful. Thousands of
killed and wounded—such is the toll of Bloody Sunday, January 9, in
St. Petersburg. The army defeated unarmed workers, women, and children. The army
vanquished the enemy by shooting prostrate workers. âWe have taught them
a good lesson!â the tsar’s henchmen and their European flunkeys from
among the conservative bourgeoisie say with consummate cynicism.


Yes, it was a great lesson, one which the Russian proletariat will not
forget. The most uneducated, backward sections of the working class, who naïvely
trusted the tsar and sincerely wished to put peacefully before âthe tsar
himselfâ the petition of a tormented people, were all taught a lesson by
the troops led by the tsar or his uncle, the Grand Duke Vladimir.


The working class has received a momentous lesson in civil war; the
revolutionary education of the proletariat made more progress in one day than it
could have made in months and years of drab, humdrum, wretched existence. The
slogan of the heroic St. Petersburg proletariat, âDeath or freedom!â is
reverberating throughout Russia. Events

    

are developing with astonishing rapidity. The general strike in St. Petersburg
      is spreading. All industrial, public, and political activities are
      paralysed. On Monday, January 10, still more violent clashes occurred
      between the workers and the military. Contrary to the mendacious
      government reports, blood is flowing in many parts of the capital. The
      workers of Kolpino are rising. The proletariat is arming itself and the
      people. The workers are said to have seized the Sestroretsk Arsenal. They
      are providing themselves with revolvers, forging their tools into weapons,
      and procuring bombs for a desperate bid for freedom. The general strike is
      spreading to the provinces. Ten thousand have already ceased work in
      Moscow, and a general strike has been called there for tomorrow (Thursday,
      January 13). An uprising has broken out in Riga. The workers are demonstrating in Lodz, an uprising is being prepared in Warsaw,
      proletarian demonstrations are taking place in Helsingfors. Unrest is
      growing among the workers and the strike is spreading in Baku, Odessa,
      Kiev, Kharkov, Koyno, and Vilna. In Sevastopol, the naval stores and
      arsenals are ablaze, and the troops refuse to shoot at the
      mutineers. Strikes in Revel and in Saratov. Workers and reservists clash
      with the troops in Radom.


The revolution is spreading. The government is beginning to lose its head. From
the policy of bloody repression it is attempting to change over to economic
concessions and to save itself by throwing a sop to the workers or promising the
nine-hour day. But the lesson of Bloody Sunday cannot be forgotten. The demand
of the insurgent St. Petersburg workers—the immediate convocation of a
Constituent Assembly on the basis of universal, direct, and equal suffrage by
secret ballot—must become the demand of all the striking
workers. Immediate overthrow of the government— this was the slogan with
which even the St. Petersburg workers who had believed in the tsar answered the
massacre of January 9; they answered through their leader, the priest Georgi
Gapon, who declared after that bloody day: âWe no longer have a tsar. A
river of blood divides the tsar from the people. Long live the fight for
freedom!â


Long live the revolutionary proletariat! say we. The general strike is rousing
and rallying increasing masses

    

of the working class and the urban poor. The arming of the people is becoming an
immediate task of the revolutionary moment.


Only an armed people can be the real bulwark of popular liberty. The sooner the
proletariat succeeds in arming, and the longer it holds its fighting positions
as striker and revolutionary, the sooner will the army begin to waver; more and
more soldiers will at last begin to realise what they are doing and they will
join sides with the people against the fiends, against the tyrant, against the
murderers of defenceless workers and of their wives and children. No matter
what the outcome of the present uprising in St. Petersburg may be, it will, in
any case, be the first step to a wider, more conscious, better organised
uprising. The government may possibly succeed in putting off the day of
reckoning, but the postponement will only make the next step of the
revolutionary onset more stupendous. This will only mean that the
Social-Democrats will take advantage of this postponement to rally the
organised fighters and spread the news about the start made by the
St. Petersburg workers. The proletariat will join in the struggle, it will quit
mill and factory and will prepare arms for itself. The slogans of the struggle
for freedom will be carried more and more widely into the midst of the urban
poor and of the millions of peasants. Revolutionary committees will be set up
at every factory, in every city district, in every large village. The people
in revolt will overthrow all the government institutions of the tsarist autocracy
and proclaim the immediate convocation of a Constituent Assembly.


The immediate arming of the workers and of all citizens in general, the
preparation and organisation of the revolutionary forces for overthrowing the
government authorities and institutions—this is the practical basis on
which revolutionaries of every variety can and must unite to strike the common
blow. The proletariat must always pursue its own independent path, never
weakening its connection with the Social-Democratic Party, always bearing in
mind its great, ultimate objective, which is to rid mankind of all
exploitation. But this independence of the Social Democratic proletarian party
will never cause us to forget the importance of a common revolutionary onset at
the

    

moment of actual revolution. We Social-Democrats can and must act
independently of the bourgeois-democratic revolutionaries and guard the
class independence of the proletariat. But we must go hand in hand with
them during the

up rising, 

when direct blows are being struck at tsarism, when resistance is offered
the troops, when the bastilles of the accursed enemy of the entire Russian
people are stormed.  

The proletariat of the whole world is now looking eagerly towards the
proletariat of Russia. The overthrow of tsarism in Russia, so valiantly begun
by our working class, will be the turning-point in the history of all countries;
it will facilitate the task of the workers of all nations, in all states, in all
parts of the globe. Let, therefore, every Social-Democrat, every
class-conscious worker bear in mind the immense tasks of the broad popular
struggle that now rest upon his shoulders. Let him not forget that he represents
also the needs and interests of the whole peasantry, of all who toil, of all
who are exploited, of the whole people against their enemy. The proletarian
heroes of St. Petersburg now stand as an example to all.

Long live the revolution!
Long live the insurgent proletariat!

Notes
 
 



Two Tactics of Social-Democry in the Democratic
  Revolution was written by Lenin in Geneva, in June-July
  1905. The book was published in late July 1905, by the Central
  Committee of the R.S.D.L.P. It was twice republished in Russia
  in the same year, once by the Central Committee of the
  R.S.D.L.P., and the second time by the Moscow Committee of the
  Party, this time in 10,000 copies.


  The book was illegally distributed throughout the
  country—particularly in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan,
  Tiflis and Baku. On February 19, 1907 it was banned by the
  St. Petersburg Press Department, and on December 22 of the same
  year the St. Petersburg Court issued an injunction for its
  destruction.


  In 1907 Lenin had Two Tactics published in the
  miscellany Twelve Years, supplementing the book with
  new notes. The material prepared by Lenin for this book, his
  plans, précis, and other notes, were published in Lenin
  Miscellany V, pp. 315-20, and XVI, pp. 151-56.

The publication of the book Moscow in December 1905 (Moscow, 1906)
could not have been more timely. It is an urgent task of the workers’ party to
assimilate the lessons of the December uprising. Unfortunately, this book is
like a barrel of honey spoilt by a spoonful of tar: most interesting
material—despite its incompleteness—and incredibly slovenly,
incredibly trite conclusions. We shall deal with these conclusions on another

       occasion[1]

;

at present we shall turn our attention to the burning political
question of the day, to the lessons of the Moscow uprising.


The principal forms of the December movement in Moscow were the peaceful strike
and demonstrations, and these were the only forms of struggle in which the vast
majority of the workers took an active part. Yet, the December action in Moscow
vividly demonstrated that the general strike, as an independent and predominant
form of struggle, is out of date, that the movement is breaking out of these
narrow bounds with elemental and irresistible force and giving rise to the
highest form of struggle—an uprising.


In calling the strike, all the revolutionary parties, all the Moscow unions
recognised and even intuitively felt that it must inevitably grow into an
uprising. On December 6 the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies resolved to
“strive to transform the strike into an armed uprising”. As a matter
of fact, however, none of the organisations were prepared for this. Even the
Joint Council of Volunteer Fighting Squads[2]

spoke (on December 9!)
of an uprising as of something remote, and it is quite evident that it
had no hand in or control of

    

the street fighting that took place. The organisations failed to keep
      pace with the growth and range of the movement.


The strike was growing into an uprising, primarily as a result of the pressure
of the objective conditions created after October. A general strike could no
longer take the government unawares: it had already organised the forces of
counter-revolution, and they were ready for military action. The whole course of
the Russian revolution after October, and the sequence of events in Moscow in
the December days, strikingly confirmed one of Marx’s profound propositions:

revolution progresses by giving rise to a strong and united counter-revolution,
i.e., it compels the enemy to resort to more and more extreme measures of
defence and in this way devises ever more powerful means of
attack.[3]


December 7 and 8: a peaceful strike, peaceful mass demonstrations. Evening of
the 8th: the siege of the Aquarium.[4]

The morning of the 9th: the crowd in
Strastnaya Square is attacked by the dragoons. Evening: the Fiedler
building[5]

is raided. Temper rises. The unorganised street crowds,
quite spontaneously and hesitatingly, set up the first barricades.


The 10th: artillery fire is opened on the barricades and the crowds in the
streets. Barricades are set up more deliberately, and no longer in isolated
cases, but on a really mass scale. The whole population is in the streets; all
the main centres of the city are covered by a network of barricades. For several
days the volunteer fighting units wage a stubborn guerrilla battle against the
troops, which exhausts the troops and compels Dubasov[6]

to beg for
reinforcements. Only on December 15 did the superiority of the government forces
become complete, and on December 17 the Semyonovsky Regiment[7]

crushed Presnya District, the last stronghold of the
uprising.


From a strike and demonstrations to isolated barricades. From isolated
barricades to the mass erection of barricades and street fighting against the
troops. Over the heads of the organisations, the mass proletarian struggle
developed from a strike to an uprising. This is the greatest historic gain the
Russian revolution achieved in December 1905; and like all preceding gains it
was purchased at the price of enormous sacrifices. The movement was raised from
a

    

general political strike to a higher stage. It compelled the reaction to go
to the limit in its resistance, and so brought vastly nearer the moment
when the revolution will also go to the limit in applying the means of
attack. The reaction cannot go further than the shelling of barricades,
buildings and crowds. But the revolution can go very much further than the
Moscow volunteer fighting units, it can go very, very much further in breadth
and depth. And the revolution has advanced far since December. The base of the
revolutionary crisis has become immeasurably broader—the blade must now be
sharpened to a keener edge.


The proletariat sensed sooner than its leaders the change in the objective
conditions of the struggle and the need for a transition from the strike to an
uprising. As is always the case, practice marched ahead of theory. A peaceful
strike and demonstrations immediately ceased to satisfy the workers; they
asked: What is to be done next? And they demanded more resolute action. The
instructions to set up barricades reached the districts exceedingly late, when
barricades were already being erected in the centre of the city. The workers set
to work in large numbers, but even this did not satisfy them; they
wanted to know: what is to be done

next?— they 

demanded active
measures. In December, we, the leaders of the Social-Democratic proletariat,
were like a commander-in-chief who has deployed his troops in such an absurd
way that most of them took no active part in the battle. The masses of the
workers demanded, but failed to receive, instructions for resolute mass action.


Thus, nothing could be more short-sighted than Plekhanov’s view, seized upon by
all the opportunists, that the strike was untimely and should not have been
started, and that “they should not have taken to arms”. On the
contrary, we should have taken to arms more resolutely, energetically and
aggressively; we should have explained to the masses that it was impossible to
confine things to a peaceful strike and that a fearless and relentless armed
fight was necessary. And now we must at last openly and publicly admit that
political strikes are inadequate; we must carry on the widest agitation among
the masses in favour of an armed uprising and make no attempt to obscure this
question by talk about

    

“preliminary stages”, or to befog it in any way. We would be
      deceiving both ourselves and the people if we concealed from the masses
      the necessity of a desperate, bloody war of extermination, as the
      immediate task of the coming revolutionary action.


Such is the first lesson of the December events. Another lesson concerns the
character of the uprising, the methods by which it is conducted, and the
conditions which lead to the troops coming over to the side of the people. An
extremely biased view on this latter point prevails in the Right wing of our
Party. It is alleged that there is no possibility of fighting modern troops; the
troops must become revolutionary. Of course, unless the revolution assumes a
mass character and affects the troops, there can be no question of serious
struggle. That we must work among the troops goes without saying. But we must
not imagine that they will come over to our side at one stroke, as a result of
persuasion or their own convictions. The Moscow uprising clearly demonstrated
how stereotyped and lifeless this view is. As a matter of fact, the wavering of
the troops, which is inevitable in every truly popular movement, leads to a
real fight for the troops whenever the revolutionary struggle

be comes 

acute. The Moscow uprising was precisely an example of the desperate, frantic
struggle for the troops that takes place between the reaction and the
revolution. Dubasov himself declared that of the fifteen thousand men of the
Moscow garrison, only five thousand were reliable. The government restrained the
waverers by the most diverse and desperate measures: they appealed to them,
flattered them, bribed them, presented them with watches, money, etc.; they
doped them with vodka, they lied to them, threatened them, confined them to
barracks and disarmed them, and those who were suspected of being least reliable
were removed by treachery and violence. And we must have the courage to
confess, openly and unreservedly, that in this respect we lagged

be hind 

the
government. We failed to utilise the forces at our disposal for such an active,
bold, resourceful and aggressive fight for the wavering troops as that which the
government waged and won. We have carried on work in the army and we will
redouble our efforts in the future ideologically to “win over” the
troops. But we shall prove to be miserable

    

pedants if we forget that at a time of uprising there must also be a physical
struggle for the troops.


In the December days, the Moscow proletariat taught us magnificent lessons in
ideologically “winning over” the troops, as, for example, on
December 8 in Strastnaya Square, when the crowd surrounded the Cossacks, mingled
and fraternised with them, and persuaded them to turn back. Or on December 10,
in Presnya District, when two working girls, carrying a red flag in a crowd of
10,000 people, rushed out to meet the Cossacks crying: “Kill us! We will
not surrender the flag alive!” And the Cossacks were disconcerted and galloped
away, amidst the shouts from the crowd: “Hurrah for the Cossacks!” These
examples of courage and heroism should be impressed forever on the mind of the
proletariat.


But here are examples of how we lagged behind Dubasov. On December 9, soldiers
were marching down Bolshaya Serpukhovskaya Street singing the
Marseillaise, on their way to join the insurgents. The workers sent
delegates to meet them. Malakhov himself galloped at breakneck speed towards
them. The workers were too late, Malakhov reached them first. He delivered a
passionate speech, caused the soldiers to waver, surrounded them with dragoons,
marched them off to barracks and locked them in. Malakhov reached the soldiers
in time and we did not, although within two days 150,000 people had risen at our
call, and these could and should have organised the patrolling of the
streets. Malakhov surrounded the soldiers with dragoons, whereas we failed to
surround the Malakhovs with bomb-throwers. We could and should have done this;
and long ago the Social-Democratic press (the old
Iskra[8])

pointed out that ruthless extermination of civil and military chiefs was our
duty during an uprising. What took place in Bolshaya Serpukhovskaya Street was
apparently repeated in its main features in front of the Nesvizhskiye Barracks
and the Krutitskiye Barracks, and also when the workers attempted to
“withdraw” the Ekaterinoslav Regiment, and when delegates were sent
to the sappers in Alexandrov, and when the Rostov artillery on its way to Moscow
was turned back, and when the sappers were disarmed in Kolomna, and so
on. During the uprising we proved unequal to our task in the fight for the
wavering troops.

 

The December events confirmed another of Marx’s profound propositions, which
      the opportunists have forgotten, namely, that insurrection is an art and
      that the principal rule of this art is the waging of a desperately bold
      and irrevocably determined offensive.[9]

    We have
    not sufficiently assimilated this truth. We ourselves have not sufficiently
    learned, nor have we taught the masses, this art, this rule to attack at all
    costs. We must make up for this omission with all our energy. It is not
    enough to take sides on the question of political slogans; it is also
    necessary to take sides on the question of an armed uprising. Those who are
    opposed to it, those who do not prepare for it, must be ruthlessly dismissed
    from the ranks of the supporters of the revolution, sent packing to its
    enemies, to the traitors or cowards; for the day is approaching when the
    force of events and the conditions of the struggle will compel us to
    distinguish between enemies and friends according to this principle. It is
    not passivity that we should preach, not mere “waiting” until
    the troops “come over”. No! We must proclaim from the house tops
    the need for a bold offensive and armed attack, the necessity at such times
    of exterminating the persons in command of the enemy, and of a most
    energetic fight for the wavering troops.


The third great lesson taught by Moscow concerns the tactics and organisation
of the forces for an uprising. Military tactics depend on the level of military
technique. This plain truth Engels demonstrated and brought home to
all Marxists.[10]

Military technique today is not what it was in the
middle of the nineteenth century. It would be folly to contend against
artillery in crowds and defend barricades with revolvers. Kautsky was right when
he wrote that it is high time now, after Moscow, to review Engels’s conclusions,
and that Moscow had inaugurated “new barricade
tactics”.[11]

These tactics are the
tactics of guerrilla warfare. The organisation required for such tactics is
that of mobile and exceedingly small units, units of ten, three or even two
persons. We often meet Social-Democrats now who scoff whenever units of five or
three are mentioned. But scoffing is only a cheap way of ignoring the
new question of tactics and organisation raised by street fighting
under the conditions imposed by modern military technique. Study carefully the
story

    

of the Moscow uprising, gentlemen, and you will understand what connection
exists between “units of five” and the question of “new
barricade tactics”.


Moscow advanced these tactics, but failed to develop them far enough, to apply
them to any considerable extent, to a really mass extent. There were too few
volunteer fighting squads, the slogan of bold attack was not issued to the
masses of the workers and they did not apply it; the guerrilla detachments were
too uniform in character, their arms and methods were inadequate, their ability
to lead the crowd was almost undeveloped. We must make up for all this and we
shall do so by learning from the experience of Moscow, by spreading this
experience among the masses and by stimulating their creative efforts to develop
it still further. And the guerrilla warfare and mass terror that have been
taking place throughout Russia practically without a break since December, will
undoubtedly help the masses to learn the correct tactics of an
uprising. Social-Democracy must recognise this mass terror and incorporate it
into its tactics, organising and controlling it of course, subordinating it to
the interests and conditions of the working-class movement and the general
revolutionary struggle, while eliminating and ruthlessly lopping off the
“hooligan” perversion of this guerrilla warfare which was so
splendidly and ruthlessly dealt with by our Moscow comrades during the uprising
and by the Letts during the days of the famous Lettish
republics.[12]


There have been new advances in military technique in the very recent
period. The Japanese War produced the hand grenade. The small-arms factories
have placed automatic rifles on the market. Both these weapons are already being
successfully used in the Russian revolution, but to a degree that is far from
adequate. We can and must take advantage of improvements in technique, teach the
workers’ detachments to make bombs in large quantities, help them and our
fighting squads to obtain supplies of explosives, fuses and automatic rifles. If
the mass of the workers takes part in uprisings in the towns, if mass attacks
are launched on the enemy, if a determined and skilful fight is waged for the
troops, who after the Duma, after Sveaborg and Kronstadt are wavering more than
ever—and if we ensure participation

    

    of the rural areas in the general struggle—victory will be
    ours in the next all-Russian armed uprising.


Let us, then, develop our work more extensively and set our
tasks more boldly, while mastering the lessons of the great days of the Russian
revolution. The basis of our work is a correct estimate of class interests and
of the requirements of the nation’s development at the present juncture. We are
rallying, and shall continue to rally, an increasing section of the proletariat,
the peasantry and the army under the slogan of overthrowing the tsarist regime
and convening a constituent assembly by a revolutionary government. As hitherto,
the basis and chief content of our work is to develop the political
understanding of the masses. But let us not forget that, in addition to this
general, constant and fundamental task, times like the present in Russia impose
other, particular and special tasks. Let us not become pedants and philistines,
let us not evade these special tasks of the moment, these special tasks of the
given forms of struggle, by meaningless references to our permanent duties,
which remain unchanged at all times and in all circumstances.


Let us remember that a great mass struggle is approaching. It will be an armed
uprising. It must, as far as possible, be simultaneous. The masses must know that
they are entering upon an armed, bloody and desperate struggle. Contempt for
death must become widespread among them and will ensure victory. The onslaught
on the enemy must be pressed with the greatest vigour; attack, not defence, must
be the slogan of the masses; the ruthless extermination of the enemy will be
their task; the organisation of the struggle will become mobile and flexible;
the wavering elements among the troops will be drawn into active
participation. And in this momentous struggle, the party of the class-conscious
proletariat must discharge its duty to the full.

The Joint Council of Volunteer Fighting Squads was
formed in Moscow at the end of October 1905. It was created at the outset for
the practical struggle against the Black Hundreds but it was kept in existence
during the December uprising. It included representatives of the volunteer
squads of the Moscow Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., the Moscow group of
Social-Democrats, the Moscow committee of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and
also of the volunteer squads bearing the names “Free District”,
“University”, “Typographical” and
“Caucasian”. The S.-R.-Menshevik majority

   

of the Joint Council was responsible for disorganising its activity; during the
days of the December armed uprising it lagged behind the revolutionary events
and was incapable of acting as the operational general staff of the
uprising.

Lenin cites the proposition put forward by Marx in his
Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1860 (see Marx and Engels,
Selected Works, Vol. 1, Moscow, 1958, p. 139).





[4]

During the evening of December 8 (21), 1905, soldiers and police cordoned off
the “Aquarium” garden (at the Sadovo-Triumfalnaya Square) where a
crowded meeting was being held in the theatre. Thanks to the selfless efforts of
the workers’ volunteer squads guarding the meeting, bloodshed was avoided; those
who possessed arms were enabled to escape through a broken fence, but the other
participants in the meeting who went out through the gate were searched, beaten
up and in many cases arrested.





[5]

The Fiedler school building (at Chistiye Prudy) was
regularly used for party meetings. During the evening of December 9 (22), 1905,
when a meeting was being held there, it was surrounded by troops. The
participants in the meeting, mostly members of volunteer squads, refused to
surrender and barricaded themselves in the building. The troops opened fire
using artillery and machine-guns. During the destruction of the building more
than 30 persons were killed or wounded; 120 were arrested.

Dubasov, F. V. (1845-1912)—Governor-General
of Moscow in 1905-06, who directed the suppression of the armed
uprising of the Moscow workers in December 1905.

Semenovtsy—soldiers of the Semenovsky Guards
Regiment who were sent from St. Petersburg to Moscow in December 1905 to
suppress the uprising of the Moscow workers.





[8]

Iskra (The Spark)—the first all-Russian
illegal Marxist revolutionary newspaper. It was founded by Lenin in 1900, and
it played a decisive part in building the Marxist revolutionary party of the
Russian working class. After the Party, at the Second Congress of the
R.S.D.L.P. in 1903, had split into a revolutionary (Bolshevik) wing and an
opportunist (Menshevik) wing, Iskra passed into the hands of the
Mensheviks and became known as the “new”
Iskra in contrast to Lenin’s old Iskra.





[9]

This refers to Engels’s Revolution and
Counter-Revolution in Germany, 1848 (New York Daily Tribune, 18.IX. 1852)
which was published in 1851-52 as a series of articles in the newspaper New
York Daily Tribune over the signature of Marx, who originally intended to
write them but, being preoccupied with his economic researches,
handed over the task to Engels. In writing the articles Engels

   

constantly consulted Marx, who also read them through, before they
were sent to the press. Not until 1913, as a result of the publication of
      the correspondence between Marx and Engels, did it become known that the
      work had been
written by Engels.





[10]

Engels expounded this proposition on a number of occasions in
his works, notably in Anti-Dühring.





[11]

Lenin deals with this in more detail in his work “The
Russian Revolution and the Tasks of the Proletariat” (see present
edition, Vol. 10, pp. 141-42).





[12]

In December 1905 various Lettish towns were seized by armed
detachments of insurgent workers, agricultural labourers and
peasants. Guerrilla war against the tsarist troops began. In January 1906 the
uprising in Latvia was suppressed by punitive expeditions
under tsarist generals.

A year of disintegration, a year of ideological and
political disunity, a year of Party driftage lies behind us. The membership
of all our Party organisations has dropped. Some of them—namely, those
whose membership was least proletarian—have fallen to pieces. The Party’s
semi-legal institutions created by the revolution have been broken up time
after time. Things reached a point when some elements within the Party,
under the impact of the general break-up, began to ask whether it was
necessary to preserve the old Social-Democratic Party, whether it was
necessary to continue its work, whether it was necessary to go
“underground” once more, and how this was to be done. And the extreme
Right (the liquidationist trend, so called) answered this question in the
sense that it was necessary to legalise ourselves at all costs, even at the
price of an open renunciation of the Party programme, tactics and
organisation. This was undoubtedly an ideological and political crisis as
well as an organisational one.  

The recent All-Russian Conference of the Russian Social- Democratic
Labour Party has led the Party out on to the road, and evidently marks a
turning-point in the development of the Russian working-class movement
after the victory of the counter-revolution. The decisions of the
conference, published in a special Report issued by the Central Committee
of our Party, have been confirmed by the Central Committee, and therefore,
pending the next Congress, stand as the decisions of the whole Party. These
decisions give a very definite answer to the question of the causes and the
significance of the crisis, as well as the means of overcoming it. By
working in the spirit of the conference

    

resolutions, by striving to make all Party workers realise clearly
and fully the present tasks of the Party, our organisations will be able to
strengthen and consolidate their forces for united and effective
revolutionary Social-Democratic work.  

The main cause of the Party crisis is indicated in the preamble of the
resolution on organisation. This main cause is the wavering intellectual
and petty-bourgeois elements, of which the workers’ party had to rid
itself; elements who joined the working-class movement mainly in the hope
of an early triumph of the bourgeois-democratic revolution and could not
stand up to a period of reaction. Their instability was revealed both in
theory ("retreat from revolutionary Marxism”: the resolution on the
present situation) and in tactics (the “whittling down of slogans”), as
well as in Party organisation. The class-conscious workers repelled this
instability, came out resolutely against the liquidators, began to take the
management and guidance of the Party organisations into their own hands. If
this hard core of our Party was unable at the outset to overcome the
elements of disunity and crisis, this was not only because the task was a
great and difficult one amidst the triumph of the counter-revolution, but
also because a certain indifference towards the Party showed itself among
those workers who, although revolutionary-minded, were not sufficiently
socialist-minded. It is precisely to the class-conscious workers of Russia
that the decisions of the conference are addressed in the first place—as
the crystallised opinion of Social- Democracy concerning the means of
combating disunity and vacillation.  

A Marxist analysis of present-day class relations and of the new policy
of tsarism; an indication of the immediate aim of the struggle which our
Party continues as before to set itself; an appreciation of the lessons of
the revolution as regards the correctness of the revolutionary
Social-Democrats’ tactics; elucidation of the causes of the Party crisis;
pointing out the role in combating it of the proletarian elements of the
Party; solution of the problem of relations between the illegal and legal
organisations; recognition of the necessity of utilising the Duma tribune
and drawing up precise instructions for the guidance of

    


    

our Duma group, linked with direct criticism of its mistakes—such was the
principal content of the decisions of the conference, which provide a
complete answer to the question of the party of the working class choosing
a definite path in the present difficult period. Let us examine this answer
more carefully.  

The interrelation of classes in their political groupings remains the
same as that which prevailed during the past period of direct revolutionary
struggle of the masses. The overwhelming majority of the peasants cannot
but strive for an agrarian revolution which would destroy semi-feudal
landownership, and which cannot be achieved without the overthrow of
tsarism. The triumph of reaction has borne down heavily on the democratic
elements of the peasantry, which is incapable of forming a solid
organisation; but despite all oppression, despite the Black-Hundred Duma,
despite the extreme instability of the Trudoviks, the revolutionary
mood of the peasant masses is clearly evidenced even by the
debates in the Third Duma. The fundamental position of the
proletariat in regard to the tasks of the bourgeois- democratic revolution
in Russia remains unaltered: to guide the democratic peasantry and to wrest
it from the influence of the liberal bourgeoisie, the Cadet Party—which
continues to draw closer and closer to the Octobrists notwithstanding petty
private squabbles, and which recently has been striving to establish
national-liberalism and to sup port tsarism and reaction by chauvinist
agitation. The struggle goes on as before—says the resolution—for the
complete abolition of the monarchy and the conquest of political power by
the proletariat and the revolutionary peasantry.  

The autocracy, as hitherto, is the principal enemy of the proletariat
and of all democratic trends. It would be a mistake, however, to imagine
that it remains unchanged. The Stolypin “constitution” and Stolypin’s
agrarian policy mark a new stage in the break-down of the old,
semi-patriarchal, semi-feudal tsarism, a new step towards its
transformation into a bourgeois monarchy. The delegates from the Caucasus,
who wished either to delete such a characterisation of the present
situation altogether, or to substitute “plutocratic” for “bourgeois”,
were wrong. The autocracy has long been plutocratic; but it is only after
the first stage

    

of the revolution, under the impact of its blows, that. the autocracy is
becoming bourgeois, both in its agrarian policy and its direct,
      nationally-organised alliance with certain strata of the bourgeoisie. The
      autocracy has been nursing the bourgeoisie for a long time now; the
      bourgeoisie, by means of the ruble, has long been winning its way to
      “the top”, securing influence on legislation and
      administration, and a place beside the noble aristocracy. But the peculiar
      feature of the present situation is that the autocracy has been forced to
      set up a representative assembly for certain strata of the bourgeoisie, to
      balance between them and the feudalist landlords, to form an alliance of
      these sections in the Duma; it has been forced to abandon all the hopes it
      had placed in the patriarchalism of the muzhik, and to seek support
      against the rural masses among the rich peas ants, who are ruining the
      village commune.


The autocracy cloaks itself with pseudo-constitutional institutions, but at the
same time its class essence is being exposed as never before, owing to the
alliance concluded by the tsar with the Purishkeviches and the Guchkovs, and
with no one else. The autocracy is attempting to take upon itself the fulfilment
of those tasks of the bourgeois revolution which are objectively
necessary—the setting-up of a representative assembly of the people which
would really manage the affairs of bourgeois society, and the purging of the
countryside of medieval, entangled and antiquated agrarian relations. But the
practical results of these new steps taken by the autocracy are, so far, exactly
nil, and this only shows more clearly than ever that other forces and other
means are necessary for the fulfilment of the historical task. In the minds of
millions of people inexperienced in politics, the autocracy was hitherto
contrasted with popular representation in general; now, the struggle is
narrowing its aims, and is more concretely defining its task as the struggle for
power in the state, which determines the character and significance of
representation itself. That is why the Third Duma marks a special stage in the
break-down of the old tsarism, in the intensification of its adventurist
character, in the deepening of the old revolutionary aims, in the widening of
the field of struggle (and of the numbers taking part in the struggle) for these
aims.

 

We must get over this stage. The present new conditions require new forms of
struggle. The use of the Duma tribune is an absolute necessity. A prolonged
effort to educate and organise the masses of the proletariat becomes
particularly important. The combination of illegal and legal organisation raises
special problems before the Party. The popularisation and clarification of the
experience of the revolution, which the liberals and liquidationist
intellectuals are seeking to discredit, are necessary both for theoretical and
practical purposes. But the tactical line of the Party—which must be able
to take the new conditions into account in its methods and means of
struggle—remains unchanged. The correctness of revolutionary
Social-Democratic tactics, states one of the resolutions of the conference, is
confirmed by the experience of the mass struggle in 1905-07. The defeat of the
revolution resulting from this first campaign revealed, not that the tasks were
wrong, not that the immediate aims were “utopian”, not that the
methods and means were mistaken, but that the forces were insufficiently
prepared, that the revolutionary crisis was insufficiently wide and
deep—and Stolypin and Co. are working to widen and deepen it with most
praiseworthy zeal! Let the liberals and terrified intellectuals lose heart
after the first genuinely mass battle for freedom, let them repeat like cowards:
don’t go where you have been beaten before, don’t tread that fatal
path again. The class-conscious proletariat will answer them: the great wars in
history, the great problems of revolutions, were solved only by the advanced
classes returning to the attack again and again—and they achieved victory
after having learned the lessons of defeat. Defeated armies learn well. The
revolutionary classes of Russia have been defeated in their first campaign, but
the revolutionary situation remains. In new forms and by other ways, sometimes
much more slowly than we would wish, the revolutionary crisis is approaching,
coming to a head again. We must carry on with the lengthy work of preparing
larger masses for that crisis; this preparation must be more serious, taking
account of higher and more concrete tasks; and the more successfully we do this
work, the more certain will be our victory in the new struggle. The Russian
proletariat can be proud of the fact that in 1905, under its leadership, a
nation

    

of slaves for the first time became a million-strong host, an army of the
revolution, striking at tsarism. And now the same proletariat will know how to
do persistently, staunchly and patiently t.he work of educating and training the
new cadres of a still mightier revolutionary force.


As we have said, utilisation of the Duma tribune is an essential element of this
work of education and training. The conference resolution on the Duma group
indicates to our Party that road which comes nearest—if we are to seek
instances in history—to the experience of German Social- Democracy at the
time of the Anti-Socialist Law. The illegal Party must know how to use, it must
learn how to use, the legal Duma group; it must train up the latter into a Party
organisation equal to its tasks. The most mistaken tactics, the most regrettable
deviation, from consistent proletarian work, dictated by the conditions of the
present period, would be to raise the question of recalling the group from the
Duma (there were two “otzovists” at the conference, but they did not
raise the question openly), or to refrain from directly and openly criticising
its mistakes and from enumerating them in the resolution (as some delegates
insisted at the conference). The resolution fully recognises that the group has
committed mistakes for which it was not alone to blame, and which were quite
similar to the inevitable mistakes of all our Party organisations. But there are
other mistakes— departures from the political line of the
Party. Since these departures occurred, since they were made by an organisation
openly acting in the name of the whole Party, the Party was bound to declare
clearly and definitely that these were deviations. In the history of
West-European socialist parties there have been a number of instances of
abnormal relations between the parliamentary groups and the Party; to this.day
these relations are quite often abnormal in the Latin countries, where the
groups do not display sufficient Party spirit. We must from the very outset
organise Social-Democratic parliamentarism in Russia on a different basis; we
must at once establish team-work in this field—so that every Social-
Democratic deputy may really feel that he has the Party behind him, that the
Party is deeply concerned over his mistakes and tries to straighten out his
path—so that every Party worker may take part in the general Duma work of
the

    

Party, learning from the practical Marxist criticism of its steps, feeling it
his duty to assist it, and striving to gear the special work of the group to the
whole propaganda and agitation activity of the Party.


The conference was the first authoritative meeting of delegates from the biggest
Party organisations to discuss the work of the Duma Social-Democratic group
during the whole session. And the decision of the conference shows very clearly
how our Party will shape its Duma work, how very exacting it will be in this
field both to itself and to the group, how undeviatingly and consistently it
proposes to work on developing genuinely Social-Democratic parliamentarism.


The question of our attitude to the Duma group has a tactical and an
organisational aspect. In the latter respect the resolution on the Duma group is
only the application of our general principles of organisational policy to a particular case, principles laid down by the conference in the resolution giving
instructions on the question of organisation. The conference has recorded that
two main tendencies exist in the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party on this
question: one of them throws the weight of emphasis on the illegal Party
organisation, the other—which is more or less akin to
liquidationism—throws the weight of emphasis on the legal and semi-legal
organisations. The point is that the present situation is characterised, as we
have already pointed out, by a certain number of Party workers leaving the
Party—especially intellectuals, but also some proletarians. The
liquidationist trend raises the question as to whether it is the best, the most
active elements that are abandoning the Party and choosing the legal organisations as their field of activity, or whether it .is the “vacillating
intellectualist and petty-bourgeois elements” that are leaving the
Party. Needless to say, by emphatically rejecting and condemning liquidationism,
the conference replied that it was the latter elements. The most proletarian
elements of the Party, and those elements of the intelligentsia that were most
consistent in principle and most Social Democratic, remained true to the Russian
Social-Democratic Labour Party. The desertions from the Party mean its
purification, they mean getting rid of its least stable element,

    

of its unreliable friends, of its “fellow-travellers” (Mitläufer), who always joined the proletariat for a while and who were
recruited from among the petty bourgeoisie or from among the
“declassed”, i. e., people thrown out of the orbit of some definite
class.


From this evaluation of the principle of Party organisation logically follows
the line of organisational policy adopt ed by the conference. To strengthen the
illegal Party organisation, to create Party cells in all spheres of work, to
set up first of all “entirely Party committees consisting of workers, even
if their number be small, in each industrial enterprise”, to concentrate
the functions of leadership in the hands of leaders of the Social-Democratic
movement from among the workers themselves—such is the task today. Need
less to say, the task of these cells and committees must be to utilise all the
semi-legal and, as far as possible, legal organisations, to maintain
“close contact with the masses”, and to direct the work in such a
way that Social-Democracy responds to all the needs of the masses. Every Party
cell and workers’ committee must become a “base for agitation, propaganda
and practical organising work among the masses”, i. e.,
they must go where the masses go, and try at every step to push the
consciousness of the masses in the direction of socialism, to link up every
specific question with the general tasks of the proletariat, to transform every
act of organisation into one of class consolidation, to win by dint of
energy and ideological influence (not by their ranks and titles, of course) the
leading role in all the proletarian legal organisations. Even if these cells
and commit tees be very small at times, they will be linked together by Party
tradition and Party organisation, by a definite class programme; and two or
three Social-Democratic members of the Party will thus be able to avoid
becoming sub merged in an amorphous legal organisation and to pursue their
Party line under all conditions, in all circumstances and in all kinds
of situations, to influence their environment in the spirit of the whole Party,
and not allow the environment to swallow them up.


Though mass organisations of one type or another may be dissolved, though the
legal trade unions may be hounded out of existence, though every open act of
workers’ initiative

    

under a regime of counter-revolution may be ruined by the police on one pretext
or another—no power on earth can prevent the concentration of masses of
workers in a capitalist country, such as Russia has already become. One way or
another, legally or semi-legally, openly or covertly, the working class will
find its own rallying points; the class- conscious Party Social-Democrats will
everywhere and always march in front of the masses, everywhere and always act
together in order to influence the masses in the spirit of the Party. And
Social-Democracy, which has proved in open revolution that it is the party of
the class, the party that succeeded in leading millions in strikes, in the
uprising of 1905, as well as in the elections of 1906-07, will now also be able
to remain the party of the class, the party of. the masses, the vanguard, which
in the hardest times will not lose touch with the bulk of the army, but will be
able to help the latter overcome these hard times, consolidate its ranks once
more, and train more and more new fighters.


Let the Black-Hundred diehards rejoice and howl inside the Duma and outside it,
in the capital and in the remote provinces, let the reaction rage—the ever
so wise Mr. Stolypin cannot take a single step without bringing the precariously balancing autocracy nearer its fall, without creating a new tangle of
political impossibilities and absurdities, without adding new and fresh forces
to the ranks of the proletariat and to the ranks of the revolutionary elements
of the peasant masses. A party which succeeds in consolidating itself for
persistent work in contact with the masses, a party of the advanced class, which
succeeds in organising its vanguard, and which directs its forces in such a way
as to influence in a Social-Democratic spirit every sign of life of the
proletariat—such a party will win no matter what
happens.

One hundred years have elapsed since Herzen’s birth. The
whole of liberal Russia is paying homage to him, studiously evading,
however, the serious questions of socialism, and taking pains to conceal
that which distinguished Herzen the revolutionary from a
liberal. The Right-wing press, too, is commemorating the Herzen centenary,
falsely asserting that in his last years Herzen renounced revolution. And
in the orations on Herzen that are made by the liberals and Narodniks
abroad, phrase-mongering reigns supreme.  

The working-class party should commemorate the Herzen centenary, not
for the sake of philistine glorification, but for the purpose of making
clear its own tasks and ascertaining the place actually held in history by
this writer who played a great part in paving the way for the Russian
revolution.  

Herzen belonged to the generation of revolutionaries among the nobility
and landlords of the first half of the last century. The nobility gave
Russia the Birons and

Arakcheyevs,[1] innumerable “drunken officers, bullies, gamblers,
heroes of fairs, masters of hounds, roisterers, floggers, pimps”, as well
as amiable

Manilovs.[2] “But,” wrote Herzen, “among them developed the men of

December 14,[3] a phalanx of heroes reared, like Romulus and Remus, on
the milk of a wild beast.... They were veritable titans, hammered out of
pure steel from head to foot, comrades-in-arms who deliberately went to
certain death in order to awaken the young generation to a new life and to
purify the children born in an environment of tyranny and

servility.”[4] 

Herzen was one of those children. The uprising of the Decembrists
awakened and “purified” him. In the feudal Russia of the forties of the
nineteenth century, he rose to a

    

height which placed him on a level with the greatest thinkers of his
time. He assimilated Hegel’s dialectics. He realised that it was “the
algebra of revolution”. He went further than Hegel, following Feuerbach to
materialism. The first of his Letters on the Study of Nature,
“Empiricism and Idealism”, written in 1844, reveals to us a thinker who
even now stands head and shoulders above the multitude of modern empiricist
natural scientists and the host of present-day idealist and semi-idealist
philosophers. Herzen came right up to dialectical materialism, and
halted—before historical materialism.  

It was this “halt” that caused Herzen’s spiritual ship wreck after
the defeat of the revolution of 1848. Herzen had left Russia, and observed
this revolution at close range. He was at that time a democrat, a
revolutionary, a socialist. But his “socialism” was one of the countless
forms and varieties of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois socialism of the
period of 1848, which were dealt their death-blow in the June days of that
year. In point of fact, it was not socialism at all, but so many
sentimental phrases, benevolent visions, which were the expression at
that time of the revolutionary character of the bourgeois
democrats, as well as of the proletariat, which had not yet freed itself
from the influence of those democrats.  

Herzen’s spiritual shipwreck, his deep scepticism and pessimism after
1848, was a shipwreck of the bourgeois illusions of
socialism. Herzen’s spiritual drama was a pro duct and reflection of that
epoch in world history when the revolutionary character of the bourgeois
democrats was already passing away (in Europe), while the
revolutionary character of the socialist proletariat had not yet
matured. This is something the Russian knights of liberal verbiage, who are
now covering up their counter-revolutionary nature by florid phrases about
Herzen’s scepticism, did not and could not understand. With these knights,
who betrayed the Russian revolution of 1905, and have even forgotten to
think of the great name of revolutionary, scepticism is a form of
transition from democracy to liberalism, to that toadying, vile, foul and
brutal liberalism which shot down the workers in 1848, restored the
shattered thrones and applauded Napoleon III, and which Herzen
cursed, unable to understand its class nature.  
 

With Herzen, scepticism was a form of transition from the illusion of a
bourgeois democracy that is “above classes” to the grim, inexorable and
invincible class struggle of the proletariat. The proof: the Letters to
an Old Comrade—to Bakunin—written by Herzen in 1869, a year before
his death. In them Herzen breaks with the anarchist Bakunin. True, Herzen
still sees this break as a mere disagreement on tactics and not as a gulf
between the world outlook of the proletarian who is confident of the
victory of his class and that of the petty bourgeois who has despaired of
his salvation. True enough, in these letters as well, Herzen repeats the
old bourgeois-democratic phrases to the effect that socialism must preach
“a sermon addressed equally to workman and master, to farmer and
townsman”. Nevertheless, in breaking with Bakunin, Herzen turned his gaze,
not to liberalism, but to the International—to the international
led by Marx, to the International which had begun to “rally the
legions” of the proletariat, to unite “the world of
labour”, which is “abandoning the world of those who enjoy without

working”.[5] 


Failing as he did to understand the bourgeois-democratic character of
the entire movement of 1848 and of all the forms of pre-Marxian socialism,
Herzen was still less able to understand the bourgeois nature of the
Russian revolution. Herzen is the founder of “Russian” socialism, of
“Narodism”. He saw “socialism” in the emancipation of the peasants
with land, in community land

tenure[6] and in the peasant idea of “the right to land”. He set forth
his pet ideas on this subject an untold number of times.  

Actually, there is not a grain of socialism in this doctrine
of Herzen’s, as, indeed, in the whole of Russian. Narodism, including the
faded Narodism of the present-day Socialist-Revolutionaries. Like the
various forms of “the socialism of 1848” in the West, this is the same
sort of sentimental phrases, of benevolent visions, in which is expressed
the revolutionism of the bourgeois peasant democracy in
Russia. The more land the peasants would have received in

1861[7] and the less they would have had to pay for it, the more would
the power of the feudal landlords have been

    

undermined and the more rapidly, freely and widely would capitalism have
developed in Russia. The idea of the “right to land” and of “equalised
division of the land” is nothing but a formulation of the revolutionary
aspiration for equality cherished by the peasants who are fighting for the
complete overthrow of the power of the landlords, for the complete
abolition of landlordism.  

This was fully proved by the revolution of 1905: on the one hand, the
proletariat came out quite independently at the head of the revolutionary
struggle, having founded the Social-Democratic Labour Party; on the other
band, the revolutionary peasants (the Trudoviks and the Peasant

Union[8]), who fought for every form of the abolition of landlordism
even to “the abolition of private landownership”, fought precisely as
proprietors, as small entrepreneurs.  

Today, the controversy over the “socialist nature” of the right to
land, and so on, serves only to obscure and cover up the really
important and serious historical question concerning the difference of
interests of the liberal bourgeoisie and the revolutionary
peasantry in the Russian bourgeois revolution;, in other words,
the question of the liberal and the democratic, the “compromising”
(monarchist) and the republican trends manifested in that revolution. This
is exactly the question posed by Herzen’s

Kolokol,[9] if we turn our attention to the essence of the
matter and not to the words, if we investigate the class struggle as the
basis of “theories” and doctrines and not vice versa.  

Herzen founded a free Russian press abroad, and that is the great
service rendered by him. Polyarnaya

Zvezda[10] took up the tradition of the
Decembrists. Kolokol (1857–67) championed the emancipation of the
peasants with might and main. The slavish silence was broken.  

But Herzen came from a landlord, aristocratic milieu. He left Russia in
1847; he had not seen the revolutionary people and could have no faith in
it. Hence his liberal appeal to the “upper ranks”. Hence his innumerable
sugary letters in Kolokol addressed to Alexander II the Hangman,
which today one cannot read without revulsion. Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov
and Serno-Solovyevich, who represented the new generation of revolutionary

raznochintsi,[11] were a thousand times right when they reproached Herzen
for these

    

departures from democracy to liberalism. However, it must be said
in fairness to Herzen that, much as he vacillated between democracy and
liberalism, the democrat in him gained the upper hand nonetheless.  

When Kavelin, one of the most repulsive exponents of liberal
servility—who at one time was enthusiastic about Kolokol
precisely because of its liberal tendencies—rose in arms against
a constitution, attacked revolutionary agitation, rose against “violence”
and appeals for it, and began to preach tolerance, Herzen broke
with that liberal sage. Herzen turned upon Kavelin’s “meagre, absurd,
harmful pamphlet” written “for the private guidance of a government
pretending to be liberal”; he denounced Kavelin’s “sentimental political
maxims” which represented “the Russian people as brutes and the
government as an embodiment of intelligence”. Kolokol printed an
article entitled “Epitaph”, which lashed out against “professors weaving
the rot ten cobweb of their superciliously paltry ideas, ex-professors,
once open-hearted and subsequently embittered because they saw that the
healthy youth could not sympathise with their scrofulous
thinking”. Kavelin at once recognised himself in this portrait.  

When Chernyshevsky was arrested, the vile liberal Kavelin wrote:

“I see nothing shocking in the arrests ... the revolutionary party
considers all means fair to overthrow the government, and the latter
defends itself by its own means.” As if in retort to this Cadet, Herzen
wrote concerning Chernyshevsky’s trial:

“And here are wretches, weed-like people, jellyfish, who say that we must
not reprove the gang of robbers and scoundrels that is governing us.”


When the liberal

Turgenev[12] wrote a private letter to Alexander II assuring him of his
loyalty, and donated two goldpieces for the soldiers wounded during the
suppression of the Polish insurrection, Kolokol wrote of “the
grey-haired Magdalen (of the masculine gender) who wrote to the tsar to
tell him that she knew no sleep because she was tormented by the thought
that the tsar was not aware of the repentance that had overcome her”. And
Turgenev at once recognised himself.  

When the whole band of Russian liberals scurried away from Herzen for
his defence of Poland, when the whole of

    

“educated society” turned its back on Kolokol, Herzen was not
dismayed. He went on championing the freedom of Po land and lashing the
suppressors, the butchers, the hangmen in the service of
Alexander II. Herzen saved the honour of Russian democracy. “We have saved
the honour of the Russian name,” he wrote to Turgenev, “and for doing so
we have suffered at the hands of the slavish majority.”  

When it was reported that a serf peasant had killed a landlord for an
attempt to dishonour the serf’s betrothed, Herzen commented in
Kolokol: “Well done!” When it was reported that army officers
would be appointed to supervise the “peaceable” progress of
“emancipation”, Herzen wrote:

“The first wise colonel who with his unit joins the peasants instead of
crushing them, will ascend the throne of the Romanovs.” When Colonel
Reitern shot himself in Warsaw (1860) because he did not want to be a
helper of hangmen, Herzen wrote: “If there is to be any shooting, the ones
to be shot should be the generals who give orders to fire upon unarmed
people.”  When fifty peasants were massacred in Bezdna, and their leader,
Anton Petrov, was executed (April 12, 1861), Herzen wrote in
Kolokol: 


   “If only my words could reach you, toiler and sufferer
   of the land of Russia!... How well I would teach you to despise your
   spiritual shepherds, placed over you by the St. Petersburg Synod and a
   German tsar.... You hate the landlord, you hate the official, you fear
   them, and rightly so; but you still believe in the tsar and the bishop
   ... do not believe them. The tsar is with them, and they are his men. It is
   him you now see—you, the father of a youth murdered in Bezdna, and you,
   the son of a father murdered in Penza.... Your shepherds are as ignorant as
   you, and as poor.... Such was another Anthony (not Bishop Anthony, but
   Anton of Bezdna) who suffered for you in Kazan.... The dead bodies of your
   martyrs will not per form forty-eight miracles, and praying to them will
   not cure a tooth ache; but their living memory may produce one
   miracle—your emancipation.”  


This shows how infamously and vilely Herzen is being slandered by our
liberals entrenched in the slavish “legal” press, who magnify Herzen’s
weak points and say nothing about his strong points. It was not Herzen’s
fault but his misfortune that he could not see the revolutionary people in
Russia itself in the 1840s. When in the sixties he came to see the
revolutionary people, he sided fearlessly with the revolutionary democracy
against liberalism. He fought for a

    

victory of the people over tsarism, not for a deal between the liberal
bourgeoisie and the landlords’ tsar. He raised aloft the banner of
revolution.  

In commemorating Herzen, we clearly see the three generations, the
three classes, that were active in the Russian revolution. At first it was
nobles and landlords, the Decembrists and Herzen. These revolutionaries
formed but a narrow group. They were very far removed from the people. But
their effort was not in vain. The Decembrists awakened Herzen. Herzen began
the work of revolutionary agitation.  

This work was taken up, extended, strengthened, and tempered by the
revolutionary raznochintsi—from Chernyshevsky to the heroes of Narodnaya

Volya.[13] The range of fighters widened, their contact with the people
became closer. “The young helmsmen of the gathering storm” is what Herzen
called them. But it was not yet the storm itself.  

The storm is the movement of the masses themselves. The proletariat,
the only class that is thoroughly revolutionary, rose at the head of the
masses and for the first time aroused millions of peasants to open
revolutionary struggle. The first onslaught in this storm took place in
1905. The next is beginning to develop under our very eyes.  

In commemorating Herzen, the proletariat is learning from his example
to appreciate the great importance of revolutionary theory. It is learning
that selfless devotion to the revolution and revolutionary propaganda among
the people are not wasted even if long decades divide the sowing from the
harvest. It is learning to ascertain the role of the various classes in the
Russian and in the international revolution. Enriched by these lessons, the
proletariat will fight its way to a free alliance with the socialist
workers of all lands, having crushed that loathsome monster, the tsarist
monarchy, against which Herzen was the first to raise the great banner of
struggle by addressing his free Russian word to the masses.  

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Biron, E. I. (1690–1772)—all-powerful favourite of the
Empress Anna Ivanovna. He came from the petty nobility of Courland and was
not a Russian subject. But while holding no official position, he exerted
great influence on the domestic and partly the foreign policy of Russia. He
established a terroristic regime and followed a policy of Germanising the
state apparatus. He took advantage of his position to rob the Treasury,
take bribes and engage in speculative deals. After the death of the Empress
he became Regent for a while. He was overthrown in November 1740 as the
result of a coup d’état.  

Arakcheyev, A. A. (1769-1834)—One of the most reactionary
representatives of the tsarist autocracy, Minister of War in the reign of
Alexander I. A man distinguished by brutality and cruelty, he exerted
tremendous influence on Russia’s home and foreign

   

policies. His name is associated with a long period of reaction and police
tyranny, brutal militarism, spying, bribery, corruption and soulless, petty
formalism, comprising what became known as the “Arakcheyev regime”.





[2]
Manilov—a character in Gogol’s Dead Souls. A
sentimental, amiable landowner, Manilov personifies pipe-dreaming and empty
talk.





[3]
The men of December 14 were Russian revolutionary noblemen who
fought against serfdom and the autocracy. They revolted on December 14,
1825.





[4]
Lenin is quoting from Alexander Herzen’s Ends and Beginnings.




[5]
The passage is taken from Herzen’s letters “To an Old Comrade” (the
fourth and second letters).





[6]
The village commune in Russia was the communal form of peasant
use of the land, characterised by compulsory crop rotation, and undivided
woods and pastures. Its principal features were collective liability
(compulsory collective responsibility of the peasants for timely and full
payments, and the fulfilment of all kinds of services for the benefit of
the state and the landlords), the periodical redistribution of the land,
with no right to refuse the allotment given, and prohibition of its
purchase and sale.  

The land fords and the tsarist government used the village commune to
intensify feudal oppression and to squeeze land redemption payments and
exactions from the people.





[7]
The “peasant Reform” of 1861 abolished serfdom in
Russia. As a result, the landlords were able to cut off for themselves over
one-fifth, or even two-fifths, of the peasants’ land. They retained
possession of the best parts of the peasants’ allotments (the “cut-off
lands”, woods, meadows, watering places, grazing grounds, and so on),
without which the peasants could not engage in independent farming. The
redemption payments imposed on the peasants for their allotments were
nothing short of plunder by the landlords and the tsarist government. To
pay off their debts by instalments to the tsarist government, the peasants
were granted credit for forty-nine years at 6 per cent interest. Arrears on
redemption payments grew from year to year. The former landlord peasants
alone paid the government 1,900 million rubles by way of compensation,
while the market price of the land transferred to the peasants did not
exceed 544 million rubles. The peasants had in effect to pay hundreds of
millions of rubles for their land, which led to the ruin of the peasant
households.  

Lenin described the “peasant Reform” of 1861 as the first act of mass
violence against the peasantry for the benefit of rising capitalism in
agriculture, as a “clearing of estates” for capitalism by the landlords.





[8]
All-Russia Peasant Union—a revolutionary-democratic
organisation founded in 1905. Its first and second congresses, herd in
Moscow in August and November 1905, drew up its programme and tactics. The
Union demanded political freedom and the immediate convening of a
constituent assembly. It favoured the tactic of boycotting the First
Duma. Its agrarian programme included the demand for abolishing private
landownership and transferring the monastery, church, crown and state lands
to the peasants without compensation. Its policy was half-hearted and
vacillating. While insisting on the abolition of the landed estates, the
Union was agreeable to partial compensation for the landlords.  

The Peasant Union was persecuted by the police ever since it came into
being. It fell to pieces early in 1907.





[9]
Kolokol (The Bell)—a political periodical,
published under the motto of Vivos voco! (I call on the living!)
by A. I. Herzen and N. P. Ogaryov at the Free Russian Printing Works
established by Herzen. The periodical was published in London from July 1,
1857 to April 1865 and in Geneva from May 1865 to July 1867. It was a
monthly, but occasionally it was brought out twice a month. In all 245
issues appeared.  

In 1868 Kolokol was published in French (15 issues appeared),
with an occasional supplement in Russian. It had a circulation of 2,500
copies and it was disseminated throughout Russia. It exposed the tyranny of
the autocracy, the plunder and embezzlement practised by the civil
servants, and the ruthless exploitation of the peasants by the
landlords. It issued revolutionary appeals and helped to rouse the people
to the struggle against the tsarist government and the ruling classes.


Kolokol was the leading organ of the revolutionary uncensored
press and the forerunner of the working-class press in Russia. It played an
important role in the development of the general-democratic and
revolutionary movement, in the struggle against the autocracy and against
serfdom.





[10]
Polyarnaya Zvezda (The Pole Star)—a
literary-political symposium. Its first three issues were published by
A. I. Herzen, and the subsequent ones by Herzen and Ogaryov, at the Free
Russian Printing Works in London from 1855 to 1862. The last issue appeared
in Geneva in 1868. Altogether eight issues appeared.





[11]
The raznochintsy (literally, men of various social-estates)
were educated members of Russian society drawn from the small towns folk,
the clergy, the merchants and the peasantry, as distinct from those drawn
from the nobility.





[12]
Turgenev, I. S. (1818-1883)—a famous Russian writer who did
much for the development of the Russian literary language. His writings
reflected the typical contradictions of Russian society. While protesting
ardently against serfdom, he put forward mode rate liberal demands. Lenin
said that “Turgenev ... was drawn towards

   

a moderate monarchist and nobleman’s constitution, ... was repelled by the
muzhik democracy of Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky”





[13]
Narodnaya Volya (People’s Will)—an illegal
organisation of the revolutionary-minded intelligentsia, the Narodniks,
founded In 1879 to combat the tsarist regime. It was active until the
second half of the 1880s.

 The questions of the present-day working-class movement are
in many respects vexed questions, particularly for representatives of that
movement’s recent past (i. e., of the stage which historically has just
drawn to a close). This applies primarily to the questions of so-called
factionalism, splits, and so forth. One often hears intellectuals in the
working-class movement making nervous, feverish and almost hysterical
appeals not to raise these vexed questions. Those who have experienced the
long years of struggle between the various trends among Marxists since
1900—01, for example, may naturally think it superfluous to repeat many of
the arguments on the subject of these vexed questions.  

 But there are not many people left today who took part in the
fourteen-year-old conflict among Marxists (not to speak of the eighteen- or
nineteen-year-old conflict, counting from the moment the first symptoms of
Economism appeared). The vast majority of the workers who now make up the
ranks of the Marxists either do not remember the old conflict, or have
never heard of it. To the overwhelming majority (as, incidentally, was
shown by the opinion poll held by our
journal[5]), these vexed questions are a matter of exception ally great
interest. We therefore intend to deal with these questions, which have been
raised as it were anew (and for the younger generation of the
workers they are really new) by Trotsky’s “non-factional workers’
journal”, Borba.  
I. “FACTIONALISM”

 Trotsky calls his new journal “non-factional”. He puts this word in
the top line in his advertisements; this word is stressed by him in every
key, in the editorial articles of Borba itself, as well as in the
liquidationist Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta, which carried an
article on Borba by Trotsky before the latter began publication.



 What is this “non-factionalism”?  

 Trotsky’s “workers’ journal” is Trotsky’s journal for
workers, as there is not a trace in it of either workers’ initiative, or
any connection with working-class organisations. Desiring to write in a
popular style, Trotsky, in his journal for workers, explains for the
benefit of his readers the meaning of such foreign words as “territory”,
“factor”, and so forth.  

 Very good. But why not also explain to the workers the meaning of the
word “non-factionalism”? Is that word more intelligible than the
words “territory” and “factor”?  

 No, that is not the reason. The reason is that the label
“non-factionalism” is used by the worst representatives of the worst
remnants of factionalism to mislead the younger generation of
workers. It is worth while devoting a little time to explaining this.  

 Group-division was the main distinguishing feature of the
Social-Democratic Party during a definite historical period. Which period?
From 1903 to 1911.  

 To explain the nature of this group-division more clearly we must
recall the concrete conditions that existed in, say, 1906—07. At that time
the Party was united, there was no split, but group-division existed,
i. e., in the united Party there were virtually two groups, two
virtually separate organisations. The local workers’ organisations were
united, but on every important issue the two groups devised two sets of
tactics. The advocates of the respective tactics disputed among themselves
in the united workers’ organisations (as was the case, for example, during
the discussion of the slogan: a Duma, or Cadet, Ministry, in 1906, or
during the elections of delegates to the London Congress in 1907), and
questions were decided by a majority vote. One group was defeated
at the Stockholm Unity Congress (1906), the other was defeated at the
London Unity Congress (1907).  

 These are commonly known facts in the history of organised Marxism in
Russia.  

 It is sufficient to recall these commonly known facts to realise what
glaring falsehoods Trotsky is spreading.  

 For over two years, since 1912, there has been no factionalism
among the organised Marxists in Russia, no disputes over tactics in
united organisations, at united conferences and
congresses. There is a complete break between the

 

Party, which in January 1912 formally announced that the liquidators do
not belong to it, and the liquidators. Trotsky often calls this state
of affairs a “split”, and we shall deal with this appellation separately
later on. But it remains an undoubted fact that the term “factionalism”
deviates from the truth.  

 As we have said, this term is a repetition, an uncritical,
unreasonable, senseless repetition of what was true yesterday,
i. e., in the period that has already passed. When Trotsky talks to us
about the “chaos of factional strife” (see No. 1, pp. 5, 6, and many
others) we realise at once which period of the past his words
echo.  

 Consider the present state of affairs from the viewpoint of the young
Russian workers who now constitute nine-tenths of the organised Marxists in
Russia. They see three mass expressions of the different views, or
trends in the working-class movement: the Pravdists, gathered around a
newspaper with a circulation of 40,000; the liquidators (15,000
circulation) and the Left Narodniks (10,000 circulation). The circulation
figures tell the reader about the mass character of a given tenet.


 The question arises; what has “chaos” got to do with it? Everybody
knows that Trotsky is fond of high-sounding and empty phrases. But the
catchword “chaos” is not only phrase-mongering; it signifies
also the transplanting, or rather, a vain attempt to transplant,
to Russian soil, in the present period, the relations that existed
abroad in a bygone period. That is the whole point.  

 There is no “chaos” whatever in the struggle between the Marxists and
the Narodniks. That, we hope, not even Trotsky will dare to
deny. The struggle between the Marxists and the Narodniks has been going on
for over thirty years, ever since Marxism came into being. The cause of
this struggle is the radical divergence of interests and viewpoints of two
different classes, the proletariat and the peasantry. If there is any
“chaos” anywhere, it is only in the heads of cranks who fail to
understand this.  

 What, then, remains? “Chaos” in the struggle between the Marxists and
the liquidators? That, too, is wrong, for a struggle against a
trend, which the entire Party recognised as a trend and condemned
as far back as 1908, cannot be

 

called chaos. And everybody who has the least concern for the history of
Marxism in Russia knows that liquidationism is most closely and inseverably
connected, even as regards its leaders and supporters, with Menshevism
(1903—08) and Economism (1894—1903). Consequently, here, too, we have a
history extending over nearly twenty years. To regard the history of one’s
own Party as “chaos” reveals an unpardonable empty-headedness.  

 Now let us examine the present situation from the point of
view of Paris or Vienna. At once the whole picture
changes. Besides the Pravdists and liquidators, we see no less
than five Russian groups claiming membership of one and the same
Social-Democratic Party: Trotsky’s group, two Vperyod groups, the
“pro-Party Bolsheviks” and the “pro-Party
Mensheviks”.[6] All Marxists in Paris and in Vienna (for the purpose
of illustration I take two of the largest centres) are perfectly well aware
of this.  

 Here Trotsky is right in a certain sense; this is indeed
group-division, chaos indeed!  

 Groups within the Party, i. e., nominal unity (all claim to
belong to one Party) and actual disunity (for, in fact, all the groups are
independent of one another and enter into negotiations and agreements with
each other as sovereign powers).  

“Chaos”, i. e., the absence of
(1) objective and verifiable proof that these groups are linked with the
working-class movement in Russia and
(2) absence of any data to enable us to judge the actual ideological and
political physiognomy of these groups. Take a period of two full
years—1912 and 1913. As everybody knows, this was a period of the revival
and upswing of the working-class movement, when every trend or tendency of
a more or less mass character (and in politics this mass character
alone counts) could not but exercise some influence on the Fourth
Duma elections, the strike movement, the legal newspapers, the trade
unions, the insurance election campaign, and so on. Throughout those two
years, not one of these five groups abroad asserted itself in the slightest
degree in any of the activities of the mass working-class movement
in Russia just enumerated!  

 That is a fact that anybody can easily verify.  


 And that fact proves that we were right in calling Trotsky a
representative of the “worst remnants of factionalism”.  

 Although he claims to be non-factional, Trotsky is known to everybody
who is in the least familiar with the working-class movement in Russia as
the representative of “Trotsky’s faction”. Here we have
group-division, for we see two essential symptoms of it:
(1) nominal recognition of unity and
(2) group segregation in fact. Here there are remnants of group-division,
for there is no evidence whatever of any real connection with the mass
working-class movement in Russia.  

 And lastly, it is the worst form of group-division, for there is
no ideological and political definiteness. It cannot be denied
that this definiteness is characteristic of both the Pravdists (even our
determined opponent L. Martov admits that we stand “solid and
disciplined” around universally known formal decisions on all questions)
and the liquidators (they, or at all events the most prominent of them,
have very definite features, namely, liberal, not Marxist).  

 It cannot be denied that some of the groups which, like Trotsky’s,
really exist exclusively from the Vienna-Paris, but by no means from the
Russian, point of view, possess a degree of definiteness. For example, the
Machist theories of the Machist Vperyod group are
definite; the emphatic repudiation of these theories and defence of
Marxism, in addition to the theoretical condemnation of liquidationism, by
the “pro-Party Mensheviks”, are definite.  

 Trotsky, however, possesses no ideological and political definiteness,
for his patent for “non-factionalism”, as we shall soon see in greater
detail, is merely a patent to flit freely to and fro, from one
group to another.  

 To sum up: 

1)
 Trotsky does not explain, nor does he understand, the historical
significance of the ideological disagreements among the various
Marxist trends and groups, although these disagreements run through the
twenty years’ history of Social Democracy and concern the fundamental
questions of the present day (as we shall show later on); 

2)
 Trotsky fails to understand that the main specific features of
group-division are nominal recognition of unity and actual
disunity; 


3)
 Under cover of “non-factionalism” Trotsky is championing the interests of
a group abroad which particularly lacks definite principles, and has no
basis in the working-class movement in Russia.  

 All that glitters is not gold. There is much glitter and sound in
Trotsky’s phrases, but they are meaningless.  
II. THE SPLIT

“Although there is no group-division, i. e., nominal recognition of
unity, but actual disunity, among you, Pravdists, there is something worse,
namely, splitting tactics,” we are told. This is exactly what Trotsky
says. Unable to think out his ideas or to get his arguments to hang
together, he rants against group-division at one moment, and at the next
shouts: “Splitting tactics are winning one suicidal victory after
another”. (No. 1, p. 6.)  

 This statement can have only one mending: “The Pravdists are
winning one victory after another” (this is an objective, verifiable fact,
established by a study of the mass working-class movement in Russia during,
say, 1912 and 1913), but I, Trotsky, denounce the Pravdists
(1) as splitters, and
(2) as suicidal politicians.  

 Let us examine this.  

 First of all we must express our thanks to Trotsky. Not long ago (from
August 1912 to February 1914) he was at one with F. Dan, who, as is well
known, threatened to “kill” anti-liquidationism, and called upon
others to do so. At present Trotsky does not threaten to “kill” our trend
(and our Party—don’t be angry, Citizen Trotsky, this is true!), he only
prophesies that it will kill itself!  

 This is much milder, isn’t it? It is almost “non-factional”, isn’t
it?  

 But joking apart (although joking is the only way of retorting mildly
to Trotsky’s insufferable phrase-mongering).  

“Suicide” is a mere empty phrase, mere “Trotskyism”.  

 Splitting tactics are a grave political accusation. This accusation is
repeated against us in a thousand different keys by the liquidators and by
all the groups enumerated above, who, from the point of view of Paris and
Vienna, actually exist.  


 And all of them repeat this grave political accusation in an amazingly
frivolous way. Look at Trotsky. He admitted that “splitting tactics are
winning [read: the Pravdists are winning] one suicidal victory after
another”. To this he adds: 


   “Numerouss advanced workers, in a state of utter
   political bewilderment, themselves often become active agents of a
   split.”  (No. 1, p. 6.)  


 Are not these words a glaring example of irresponsibility on this
question?  

 You accuse us of being splitters when all that we see in front of us in
the arena of the working-class movement in Russia is liquidationism. So you
think that our attitude towards liquidationism is wrong? Indeed,
all the groups abroad that we enumerated above, no matter how much
they may differ from each other, are agreed that our attitude towards
liquidationism is wrong, that it is the attitude of “splitters”. This,
too, reveals the similarity (and fairly close political kinship) between
all these groups and the liquidators.  

 If our attitude towards liquidationism is wrong in theory, in
principle, then Trotsky should say so straightforwardly, and state
definitely, without equivocation, why he thinks it is wrong. But
Trotsky has been evading this extremely important point for years.


 If our attitude towards liquidationism has been proved wrong in
practice, by the experience of the movement, then this experience should be
analysed; but Trotsky fails to do this either. “Numerous advanced
workers,” he admits, “become active agents of a split” (read:
active agents of the Pravdist line, tactics, system and organisation).


 What is the cause of the deplorable fact, which, as Trotsky admits, is
confirmed by experience, that the advanced workers, the
numerous advanced workers at that, stand for Pravda?


 It is the “utter political bewilderment” of these advanced workers,
answers Trotsky.  

 Needless to say, this explanation is highly flattering to Trotsky, to
all five groups abroad, and to the liquidators. Trotsky is very fond of
using, with the learned air of the expert, pompous and high-sounding
phrases to explain

 

historical phenomena in a way that is flattering to Trotsky. Since
“numerous advanced workers” become “active agents” of a political and
Party line which does not conform to Trotsky’s line, Trotsky settles the
question unhesitatingly, out of hand: these advanced workers are “in a
state of utter political bewilderment”, whereas he, Trotsky, is evidently
“in a state” of political firmness and clarity, and keeps to the right
line!... And this very same Trotsky, beating his breast, fulminates against
factionalism, parochialism, and the efforts of intellectuals to impose
their will on the workers!  

 Reading things like these, one cannot help asking oneself:
is it from a lunatic asylum that such voices come?  

 The Party put the question of liquidationism, and of condemning it,
before the “advanced workers” as far back as 1908, while the question of
“splitting” away from a very definite group of liquidators (namely, the
Nasha Zarya group), i. e., that the only way to build up the Party
was without this group and in opposition to it—this question was
raised in January 1912, over two years ago. The overwhelming majority of
the advanced workers declared in favour of supporting the
“January (1912) line”. Trotsky himself admits this fact when he talks
about “victories” and about “numerous advanced workers”. But Trotsky
wriggles out of this simply by hurling abuse at these advanced
workers and calling them “splitters” and “politically bewildered”!


 From these facts sane people will draw a different conclusion. Where
the majority of the class-conscious workers have rallied around
precise and definite decisions, there we shall find unity of
opinion and action, there we shall find the Party spirit, and the Party.


 Where we see liquidators who have been “removed from office” by the
workers, or half a dozen groups outside Russia, who for two years have
produced no proof that they are connected with the mass working-class
movement in Russia, there, indeed, we shall find bewilderment and
splits. In now trying to persuade the workers not to carry out
the decisions of that “united whole”, which the Marxist Pravdists
recognise, Trotsky is trying to disrupt the movement and cause a
split.  


 These efforts are futile, but we must expose the arrogantly conceited
leaders of intellectualist groups, who, while causing splits themselves,
are shouting about others causing splits; who, after sustaining utter
defeat at the hands of the “advanced workers” for the past two years
or more, are with incredible insolence flouting the decisions and
the will of these advanced workers and saying that they are
“politically bewildered”. These are entirely the methods of
Nozdrev,[7] or of “Judas”
Golovlyov.[8] 

 In reply to these repeated outcries about a split and in fulfilment of
my duty as a publicist, I will not tire of repeating precise,
unrefuted and irrefutable figures. In the Second Duma, 47 per cent of the
deputies elected by the worker curia were Bolsheviks, in the Third Duma 50
per cent were Bolsheviks, and in the Fourth Duma 67 per cent.  

 There you have the majority of the “advanced workers”, there you have
the Party; there you have unity of opinion and action of the majority of
the class-conscious workers.  

 To this the liquidators say (see Bulkin, L. M., in Nasha Zarya
No. 3) that we base our arguments on the Stolypin curias. This is a foolish
and unscrupulous argument. The Germans measure their successes by the
results of elections conducted under the Bismarckian electoral law, which
excludes women. Only people bereft of their senses would reproach the
German Marxists for measuring their successes under the existing
electoral law, without in the least justifying its reactionary
restrictions.  

 And we, too, without justifying curias, or the curia system, measured
our successes under the existing electoral law. There were curias
in all three (Second, Third and Fourth) Duma elections; and within
the worker curia, within the ranks of Social-Democracy, there was
a complete swing against the liquidators. Those who do not wish to
deceive themselves and others must admit this objective fact, namely, the
victory of working-class unity over the liquidators.  

 The other argument is just as “clever”: “Mensheviks and liquidators
voted for (or took part in the election of) such and-such a Bolshevik.”
Splendid! But does not the same thing apply to the 53 per cent
non-Bolshevik deputies re turned to the Second Duma, and to the 50 per cent
returned

 

to the Third Duma, and to the 33 per cent returned to the Fourth Duma?


 If, instead of the figures on the deputies elected, we could obtain the
figures on the electors, or workers’ delegates, etc., we would gladly quote
them. But these more detailed figures are not available, and
consequently the “disputants” are simply throwing dust in people’s eyes.


 But what about the figures of the workers’ groups that assisted the
newspapers of the different trends? During two years (1912 and
1913), 2,801 groups assisted Pravda, and 750 assisted
    Luch.[1]

These figures are verifiable and nobody has attempted to disprove them.


 Where is the unity of action and will of the majority of the
“advanced workers”, and where is the flouting of the will of the
majority?  

 Trotsky’s “non-factionalism” is, actually, splitting tactics, in that
it shamelessly flouts the will of the majority of the workers.  
III. THE BREAK-UP OF THE AUGUST BLOC

 But there is still another method, and a very important one, of
verifying the correctness and truthfulness of Trotsky’s accusations about
splitting tactics.  

 You consider that it is the “Leninists” who are splitters? Very well,
let us assume that you are right.  

 But if you are, why have not all the other sections and groups proved
that unity is possible with the liquidators without the
“Leninists”, and against the “splitters”?... If we are
splitters, why have not you, uniters, united among yourselves, and with the
liquidators? Had you done that you would have proved to the workers by
deeds that unity is possible and beneficial!...  

 Let us go over the chronology of events.  

 In January 1912, the “Leninist” “splitters” declared that they were
a Party without and against the liquidators.  

 In March 1912, all the groups and “factions”: liquidators,
Trotskyists, Vperyodists, “pro-Party Bolsheviks” and “pro-Party

 

Mensheviks”, in their Russian news sheets and in the columns of the German
Social-Democratic newspaper Vorw\"arts, united against these
“splitters”. All of them unanimously, in chorus, in unison and in one
voice vilified us and called us “usurpers”, “mystifiers”, and other no
less affectionate and tender names.  

 Very well, gentlemen! But what could have been easier for you than to
unite against the “usurpers” and to set the “advanced workers”
an example of unity? Do you mean to say that if the advanced
workers had seen, on the one hand, the unity of all against the usurpers,
the unity of liquidators and non-liquidators, and on the other,
isolated “usurpers”, “splitters”, and so forth; they would not
have supported the former?  

 If disagreements are only invented, or exaggerated, and so forth, by
the “Leninists”, and if unity between the liquidators, Plekhanovites,
Vperyodists, Trotskyists, and so forth, is really possible, why
have you not proved this during the past two years by your own
example?  

 In August 1912, a conference of “uniters” was
convened. Disunity started at once: the Plekhanovites refused to
attend at all; the Vperyodists attended, but walked out after protesting
and exposing the fictitious character of the whole business.  

 The liquidators, the Letts, the Trotskyists (Trotsky and Semkovsky),
the Caucasians, and the Seven “united”. But did they? We stated at the
time that they did not, that this was merely a screen to cover up
liquidationism. Have the events disproved our statement?  

 Exactly eighteen months later, in February 1914, we found: 

1.
 that the Seven was breaking up. Buryanov had left them.  

2.
 that in the remaining new “Six”, Chkheidze and Tulyakov, or somebody
else, could not see eye to eye on the reply to be made to Plekhanov. They
stated in the press that they would reply to him, but they could
not.  

3.
 that Trotsky, who for many months had practically vanished from the columns
of Luck, had broken away, and had started “his own”
journal, Borba. By calling this journal “non-factional”, Trotsky
clearly (clearly to those who

 

are at all familiar with the subject) intimates that in his, Trotsky’s,
opinion, Nasha Zarya and Luch had proved to be
“factional”, i. e., poor uniters.  

 If you are a uniter, my dear Trotsky, if you say that it is possible to
unite with the liquidators, if you and they stand by the “fundamental
ideas formulated in August 1912” (Borba No. 1, p. 43, Editorial
Note), why did not you yourself unite with the liquidators in
Nasha Zarya and Luch?  

 When, before Trotsky’s journal appeared, Severnaya Rabochaya
Gazeta published some scathing comment stating that the physiognomy of
this journal was “unclear” and that there had been “quite a good deal of
talk in Marxist circles” about this journal, Put Pravdy
       (No. 37)[2]

was naturally obliged to expose this falsehood. It said: “There has been
talk in Marxist circles” about a secret memorandum written by Trotsky
against the Luch group; Trotsky’s physiognomy and his
breakaway from the August bloc were perfectly “clear”.  

4.
 An, the well-known leader of the Caucasian liquidators, who had attacked
L. Sedov (for which he was given a public wigging by F. Dan and Co.), now
appeared in Borba. It remains “unclear” whether the Caucasians
now desire to go with Trotsky or with Dan.  

5.
 The Lettish Marxists, who were the only real organisation in the “August
bloc”, had formally withdrawn from it, stating (in 1914)
in the resolution of their last Congress that: 


   “the attempt on the part of the conciliators to
   unite at all costs with the liquidators (the August Conference of 1912)
   proved fruitless, and the uniters themselves became ideologically and
   politically dependent upon the liquidators.”  


 This statement was made,after eighteen months’ experience, by an
organisation which had itself been neutral and had not
desired to establish connection with either of the two
centres. This decision of neutrals should carry all the more
weight with Trotsky!  

 Enough, is it not?  

 Those who accused us of being splitters, of being unwilling or unable
to get on with the liquidators, were themselves
 

unable to get on with them. The August bloc proved to be a fiction and
broke up.  

 By concealing this break-up from his readers, Trotsky is deceiving
them.  

 The experience of our opponents has proved that we are right, has
proved that the liquidators cannot be co-operated with.  
IV. A CONCILIATOR’S ADVICE TO THE “SEVEN”

 The editorial article in issue No. 1 of Borba entitled “The
Split in the Duma Group” contains advice from a conciliator to the seven
pro-liquidator (or inclining towards liquidationism) members of the
Duma. The gist of this advice is contained in the following words: 


   “first of all consult the Six whenever it is necessary
   to reach an agreement with other groups....” (P. 29.)  


 This is the wise counsel which, among other things, is evidently the
cause of Trotsky’s disagreement with the liquidators of Luch. This
is the opinion the Pravdists have held ever since the outbreak of the
conflict between the two groups in the Duma, ever since the resolution of
the Summer (1913) Conference was adopted. The Russian Social-Democratic
Labour group in the Duma has reiterated in the press, even after
the split, that it continues to adhere to this position, in spite of the
repeated refusals of the Seven.  

 From the very outset, since the time the resolution of the Summer
Conference was adopted, we have been, and still are, of the opinion that
agreements on questions concerning activities in the Duma
are desirable and possible; if such agreements have been repeatedly arrived
at with the petty-bourgeois peasant democrats (Trudoviks), they are all the
more possible and necessary with the petty-bourgeois, liberal-labour
politicians.  

 We must not exaggerate disagreements, but we must face the facts: the
Seven are men, leaning towards liquidationism, who yesterday entirely
followed the lead of Dan, and whose eyes today are travelling longingly
from Dan to Trotsky and back again. The liquidators are a group of
legalists who have broken away from the Party and are pursuing a liberal-

 

labour policy. Since they repudiate the “underground”, there can be no
question of unity with them in matters concerning Party organisation and
the working-class movement. Who ever thinks differently is badly mistaken
and fails to take into account the profound nature of the changes that have
taken place since 1908.  

 But agreements on certain questions with this group, which
stands outside or on the fringe of the Party, are, of course, permissible:
we must always compel this group, too, like the Trudoviks, to
choose between the workers’ (Pravdist) policy and the liberal policy. For
example, on the question of fighting for freedom of the press the
liquidators clearly revealed, vacillation between the liberal formulation
of the question, which repudiated, or overlooked, the illegal press, and
the opposite policy, that of the workers.  

 Within the scope of a Duma policy in which the most important
extra-Duma issues are not directly raised, agreements with the
seven liberal-labour deputies are possible and desirable. On this point
Trotsky has shifted his ground from that of the liquidators
to that of the Party Summer (1913) Conference.  

 It should not be forgotten, however, that to a group standing outside
the Party, agreement means something entirely different from what Party
people usually understand by the term. By “agreement” in the Duma,
non-Party people mean “drawing up a tactical resolution, or
line”. To Party people agreement is an attempt to enlist others
in the work of carrying out the Party line.  

 For example, the Trudoviks have no party. By agreement they understand
the “voluntary”, so to speak, “drawing up” of a line, today with the
Cadets, tomorrow with the Social-Democrats. We, however, understand
something entirely different by agreement with the Trudoviks. We have Party
decisions on all the important questions of tactics, and we shall never
depart from these decisions; by agreement with the Trudoviks we mean
winning them over to our side, convincing them that we
are right, and not rejecting joint action against the Black
Hundreds and against the liberals.  

 How far Trotsky has forgotten (not for nothing has he associated with
the liquidators) this elementary difference

 

between the Party and non-Party point of view on agreements, is shown by
the following argument of his: 


   “The representatives of the International must bring
   together the two sections of our divided parliamentary group and jointly
   with them ascertain the points of agreement and points of
   disagreement.... A detailed tactical resolution formulating the principles
   of parliamentary tactics may he drawn up....”  (No. 1, pp. 29—30.)  


 Here you have a characteristic and typical example of the
liquidationist presentation of the question! Trotsky’s journal forgets
about the Party; such a trifle is hardly worth remembering!  

 When different parties in Europe (Trotsky is fond of inappropriately
talking about Europeanism) come to an agreement or unite, what they do is
this: their respective representatives meet and first of all ascertain the
points of disagreement (precisely what the International proposed in
relation to Russia, without including in the resolution Kautsky’s
ill-considered statement that “the old Party no longer
exists”[9]). Having ascertained the points of disagreement, the
representatives decide what decisions (resolutions, conditions,
etc.) on questions of tactics, organisation, etc., should be submitted
to the congresses of the two parties. If they succeed in drafting
unanimous decisions, the congresses decide whether to adopt them or not. If
differing proposals are made, they too are submitted for final
decision to the congresses of the two parties.  

 What appeals to the liquidators and Trotsky is only the
European models of opportunism, but certainly not the models of
European partisanship.  

“A detailed tactical resolution” will be drawn up by the members of
the Duma! This example should serve the Russian “advanced workers”, with
whom Trotsky has good reason to be so displeased, as a striking
illustration of the lengths to which the groups in Vienna and Paris—who
persuaded even Kautsky that there was “no Party” in Russia—go in their
ludicrous project-mongering. But if it is some times possible to fool
foreigners on this score, the Russian “advanced workers” (at the risk of
provoking the terrible Trotsky to another outburst of displeasure) will
laugh in the faces of these project-mongers.  


“Detailed tactical resolutions,” they will tell them, “are drawn up
among us (we do not know how it is done among you lion-Party people) by
Party congresses and conferences, for example, those of 1907, 1908, 1910,
1912 and 1913. We shall gladly acquaint uninformed foreigners, as well as
forgetful Russians, with our Party decisions, and still more gladly ask the
representatives of the Seven, or the August bloc members, or Left-wingers
or anybody else, to acquaint us with the resolutions of their congresses,
or conferences, and to bring up at their next congress the definite
question of the attitude they should adopt towards our resolutions, or
towards the resolution of the neutral Lettish Congress of 1914, etc.”


 This is what the “advanced workers” of Russia will say to the various
project-mongers, and this has already been said iii the Marxist
press, for example, by the organised Marxists of St. Petersburg. Trotsky
chooses to ignore these published terms for the liquidators? So much the
worse for Trotsky. It is our duty to warn our readers how ridiculous that
“unity” (the August type of “unity”?) project-mongering is which
refuses to reckon with the will of the majority of the class-conscious
workers of Russia.  
V. TROTSKY’S LIQUIDATIONIST VIEWS

 As to the substance of his own views, Trotsky contrived to say as
little as possible in his new journal. Put Pravdy (No. 37) has
already commented on the fact that Trotsky has not said a word either on
the question of the “underground” or on the slogan of working for a legal
party,
 etc.[3]

That, among other things, is why we say that when attempts are made to form
a separate organisation which is to have no ideological and
political physiognomy, it is the worst form of factionalism.  

 Although Trotsky has refrained from openly expounding his views, quite
a number of passages in his journal show what kind of ideas he has been
trying to smuggle in.  

 In the very first editorial article in the first issue of his journal,
we read the following: 



   “The pre-revolutionary Social-Democratic Party in our
   country was a workers’ party only in ideas and aims. Actually, it
   was an organisation of the Marxist intelligentsia, which led the awakening
   working class.” (5.)  


 This is the old liberal and liquidationist tune, which is really the
prelude to the repudiation of the Party. It is based on a
distortion of the historical facts. The strikes of 1895—96 had already
given rise to a mass working-class movement, which both in ideas
and organisation was linked with the Social-Democratic movement. And in
these strikes, in this economic and non-economic agitation, the
“intelligentsia led the working class”!?  

 Or take the following exact statistics of political offences in the
period 1901—03 compared with the preceding period.  


Occupations of participants in the emancipation movement prosecuted for political offences (per cent)


Period
Agriculture
Industry and commerce
Liberal professions and students
No definite occupation, and no occupation




1884—90 
7.1
15.1
53.3
19.9


1901—03 
9.0
46.1
28.7
8.0




 We see that in the eighties, when there was as yet no Social-Democratic
Party in Russia, and when the movement was “Narodnik”, the intelligentsia
predominated, accounting for over half the participants.  

 But the picture underwent a complete change in 1901—03, when a
Social-Democratic Party already existed, and when the old Iskra
was conducting its work. The intelligentsia were now a minority
among the participants of the movement; the workers (“industry
and commerce”) were far more numerous than the intelligentsia, and the
workers and peasants together constituted more than half the total.  

 It was precisely in the conflict of trends within the Marxist movement
that the petty-bourgeois intellectualist wing of the
Social-Democracy made itself felt, beginning with Economism (1895—1903)
and continuing with Menshevism (1903—1908) and liquidationism
(1908—1914). Trotsky

 

repeats the liquidationist slander against the Party and is afraid to
mention the history of the twenty years’ conflict of trends within the
Party.  

 Here is another example.  


   “In its attitude towards parliamentarism, Russian
   Social-Democracy passed through the same three stages ... [as in other
   countries] ...  first ‘boycottism’ ... then the acceptance in principle of
   parliamentary tactics, but ... [that magnificent “but”, the “but” which
   Shchedrin translated as: The ears never grow higher than the forehead,

never![4]]...

   for purely agitational purposes ... and lastly, the presentation from the
   Duma rostrum ... of current demands....”  (No. 1, p. 34.)  


 This, too, is a liquidationist distortion of history. The distinction
between the second and third stages was invent ed in order to smuggle in a
defence of reformism and opportunism. Boycottism as a stage in “the
attitude of Social-Democracy towards parliamentarism” never existed
either in Europe (where anarchism has existed and continues to
exist) or in Russia, where the boycott of the Bulygin Duma, for example,
applied only to a definite institution, was never linked
with “parliamentarism”, and was engendered by the peculiar nature of the
struggle between liberalism and Marxism for the continuation of the
onslaught. Trotsky does not breathe a word, about the way this struggle
affected the conflict between the two trends in Marxism!  

 When dealing with history, one must explain concrete questions and the
class roots of the different trends; anybody who wants to make a Marxist
study of the struggle of classes and trends over the question of
participation in the Bulygin Duma, will see therein the roots of the
liberal-labour policy. But Trotsky “deals with” history only in order to
evade concrete questions and to invent a justification,
or a semblance of justification, for the present-day opportunists!  


   “Actually, all trends,” he writes, “employ the same
   methods of struggle and organisation.” “The outcries about the liberal
   danger in our working-class movement are simply a crude and sectarian
   travesty of reality.” (No. 1, pp. 5 and 35.)  


 This is a very clear and very vehement, defence of the liquidators. But
we will take the liberty of quoting at least

 

one small fact, one of the very latest. Trotsky merely slings words about;
we should like the workers themselves to ponder over the facts.  

 It is a fact that Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta for March 13
wrote the following: 


   “Instead of emphasising the definite and concrete
   task that confronts the working class, viz., to compel the Duma to throw
   out the bill [on the press], a vague formula is
   proposed of fighting for the ‘uncurtailed slogans’, and at the same time
   the illegal press is widely advertised, which can only lead to the
   relaxation of the workers’ struggle for their legal press.”  


 This is a clear, precise and documentary defence of the liquidationist
policy and a criticism of the Pravda policy. Well, will any
literate person say that both trends employ “the same methods of struggle
and organisation” on this question? Will any literate person say that the
liquidators are not pursuing a liberal-labour policy on
this question, that the liberal menace to the working-class movement is
purely imaginary?  

 The reason why Trotsky avoids facts and concrete references is because
they relentlessly refute all his angry outcries and pompous phrases. It is
very easy, of course, to strike an attitude and say: “a crude and
sectarian travesty”. Or to add a still more stinging and pompous
catch-phrase, such as “emancipation from conservative factionalism”.


 But is this not very cheap? Is not this weapon borrowed from the
arsenal of the period when Trotsky posed in all his splendour before
audiences of high-school boys?  

 Nevertheless, the “advanced workers”, with whom Trotsky is so angry,
would like to be told plainly and clearly:
Do you or do you not approve of the “method of struggle and organisation”
that is definitely expressed in the above-quoted appraisal of a definite
political campaign? If you do, then you are pursuing a liberal-labour
policy, betraying Marxism and the Party; to talk of “peace” or of
“unity” with such a policy, with groups which pursue
such a policy, means deceiving yourself and others.  

 If not, then say so plainly. Phrases will not astonish, satisfy or
intimidate the present-day workers.  

 Incidentally, the policy advocated by the liquidators in the
above-quoted passage is a foolish one even from the

 

liberal point of view, for the passage of a bill in the Duma depends on
“Zemstvo-Octobrists” of the type of Bennigsen, who has already shown his
hand in the committee.  
 *     *  * 

 The old participants in the Marxist movement in Russia know Trotsky
very well, and there is no need to discuss him for their benefit. But the
younger generation of workers do not know him, and it is therefore
necessary to discuss him, for he is typical of all the five groups abroad,
which, in fact, are also vacillating between the liquidators and the Party.


 In the days of the old Iskra (1901—03), these waverers, who
flitted from the Economists to the Iskrists and back again, were dubbed
“Tushino turncoats” (the name given in the Troublous Times in Rus to
fighting men who went over from one camp to
another[10]).  

 When we speak of liquidationism we speak of a definite ideological
trend, which grew up in the course of many years, stems from Menshevism and
Economism in the twenty years’ history of Marxism, and is connected with
the policy and ideology of a definite class—the liberal bourgeoisie.


 The only ground the “Tushino turncoats” have for claiming that they
stand above groups is that they “borrow” their ideas from one group one
day and from another the next day. Trotsky was an ardent Iskrist in
1901—03, and Ryazanov described his role at the Congress of 1903 as
“Lenin’s cudgel”. At the end of 1903, Trotsky was an ardent Menshevik,
i. e., he deserted from the Iskrists to the Economists. He said that
“between the old Iskra and the new lies a gulf”. In 1904—05, he
deserted the Mensheviks and occupied a vacillating position, now
co-operating with Martynov (the Economist), now proclaiming his absurdly
Left “permanent revolution” theory. In 1906—07, he approached the
Bolsheviks, and in the spring of 1907 he declared that he was in agreement
with Rosa Luxemburg.  

 In the period of disintegration, after long “non-factional”
vacillation, he again went to the right, and in August 1912, he entered
into a bloc with the liquidators. He has now

 

deserted them again, although in substance he reiterates their
shoddy ideas.  

 Such types are characteristic of the flotsam of past historical
formations, of the time when the mass, working-class movement in Russia was
still dormant, and when every group had “ample room” in which to pose as
a trend, group or faction, in short, as a “power”, negotiating
amalgamation with others.  

 The younger generation of workers should know exactly whom they are
dealing with, when individuals come before them with incredibly pretentious
claims, unwilling absolutely to reckon with either the Party
decisions, which since 1908 have defined and established our attitude
towards liquidationism, or with the experience of the present-day
working-class movement in Russia, which has actually brought about the
unity of the majority on the basis of full recognition of the
aforesaid decisions.

 A preliminary calculation made up to April 1, 1914, showed 4,000 groups
for Pravda (commencing with January 1,1912) and 1,000 for the
liquidators and all their allies taken together.  —Lenin

 Pro-Party Bolsheviks—conciliators with leanings towards the
liquidators. (For further details see Lenin’s article “Adventurism”,
pp. 350—59 of this volume.)  

 Pro-Party Mensheviks—headed by Plekhanov, came out against
the liquidators during the period of reaction. While taking a Menshevik
stand, the Plekhanovites at the same time stood for the preservation and
strengthening of the illegal Party organisation and therefore stood for a
bloc with the Bolsheviks. Plekhanov broke the bloc with the Bolsheviks at
the end of 1911. Under the guise of fighting “factionalism” and the split
in the R.S.D.L.P. be attempted to reconcile the Bolsheviks with the
opportunists. In 1912 the Plekhanovites, together with the Trotskyists,
Bundists and liquidators, came out against the decisions of the Prague
Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.

[9]

 At the December meeting of the International Socialist Bureau (held in
London on December 13—14, 1913) a resolution was adopt ed instructing the
Executive of the International Socialist Bureau to call a meeting of
representatives of “all factions of the labour movement in Russia,
including Russian Poland, who recognise the Party Programme or whose
programme corresponds with that of the Social-Democrats, for a mutual
exchange o opinions (Aussprache) on points of disagreement”. In
seconding this resolution, Kautsky, in his speech of December 14, stated
that the old Social-Democratic Party in Russia was dead. It had to be
re-established on the basis of the Russian workers’ urge for unity. In his
article “A Good Resolution and a Bad Speech”, Lenin examined this
resolution and called Kautsky’s speech monstrous. (See present edition,
Vol. 19, pp. 528—30.)





[10]
 The Troublous Times—a term used in pre-revolutionary Russian
historiography to denote the period of the peasant war and the struggle of
the Russian people against the Polish and Swedish intervention in the early
seventeenth century.  

 In 1608 the Polish troops under Pseudo-Dmitry II, a henchman of the
Polish landed gentry who posed as the younger son of the Russian tsar Ivan
the Terrible, invaded Russia, and reached the outskirts of Moscow, where
they encamped in Tushino. A government headed by Pseudo-Dmitry was formed
in Tushino in opposition to the government of Moscow. Some of the Russian
nobles and boyar aristocracy deserted one camp for another in an effort to
keep in with the winning side. These deserters were called “Tushino
turncoats”.

The European war, which the governments and the bourgeois
    parties of all countries have been preparing for decades, has broken
    out. The growth of armaments, the extreme intensification of the struggle
    for markets in the latest—the imperialist—stage of capitalist
    development in the advanced countries, and the dynastic interests of the
    more backward East-European monarchies were inevitably bound to bring about
    this war, and have done so. Seizure of territory and subjugation of other
    nations, the ruining of competing nations and the plunder of their wealth,
    distracting the attention of the working masses from the internal political
    crises in Russia, Germany, Britain and other countries, disuniting and
    nationalist stultification of the workers, and the extermination of their
    vanguard so as to weaken the revolutionary movement of the
    proletariat—these comprise the sole actual content, importance and
    significance of the present war.


It is primarily on Social-Democracy that the duty rests of revealing the
    true meaning of the war, and of ruthlessly exposing the falsehood, sophistry
    and “patriotic” phrasemongering spread by the ruling classes, the
    landowners and the bourgeoisie, in defence of the war.


One group of belligerent nations is headed by the German bourgeoisie. It
    is hoodwinking the working class and the toiling masses by asserting that
    this is a war in defence of the fatherland, freedom and civilisation, for
    the liberation of the peoples oppressed by tsarism, and for the destruction
    of reactionary tsarism. In actual fact, however, this bourgeoisie, which
    servilely grovels to the Prussian Junkers, headed by Wilhelm II, has always
    been a most faithful ally of tsarism, and an enemy of the revolutionary
    movement of Russia’s workers and peasants. In fact, whatever the
    outcome of the war, this bourgeoisie will together with the

    

      Junkers, exert every effort to support the tsarist monarchy against a
      revolution in Russia.


In fact, the German bourgeoisie has launched a robber campaign against
    Serbia, with the object of subjugating her and throttling the national
    revolution of the Southern Slavs, at the same time sending the bulk of its
    military forces against the freer countries, Belgium and France, so as to
    plunder richer competitors. In fact, the German bourgeoisie, which has been
    spreading the fable that it is waging a war of defence, chose the moment it
    thought most favourable for war, making use of its latest improvements in
    military matériel and forestalling the rearmament already planned and
    decided upon by Russia and France.


The other group of belligerent nations is headed by the British and the
    French bourgeoisie, who are hoodwinking the working class and the toiling
    masses by asserting that they are waging a war for the defence of their
    countries, for freedom and civilisation and against German militarism and
    despotism. In actual fact, this bourgeoisie has long been spending thousands
    of millions to hire the troops of Russian tsarism, the most reactionary and
    barbarous monarchy in Europe, and prepare them for an attack on
    Germany.


In fact, the struggle of the British and the French bourgeoisie is aimed
    at the seizure of the German colonies, and the ruining of a rival nation,
    whose economic development has been more rapid. In pursuit of this noble
    aim, the “advanced” “democratic” nations are helping
    the savage tsarist regime to still more throttle Poland, the Ukraine, etc.,
    and more thoroughly crush the revolution in Russia.


Neither group of belligerents is inferior to the other in spoiliation,
    atrocities and the boundless brutality of war; however, to hoodwink the
    proletariat and distract its attention from the only genuine war of
    liberation, namely, a civil war against the bourgeoisie both of its
    “own” and of “foreign” countries—to achieve so
    lofty an aim—the bourgeoisie of each country is trying, with the help
    of false phrases about patriotism, to extol the significance of its
    “own” national war, asserting that it is out to defeat the enemy,
    not for plunder and the seizure of territory, but for the
    “liberation” of all other peoples except its own.

 

But the harder the governments and the bourgeoisie of all countries try
    to disunite the workers and pit them against one another, and the more
    savagely they enforce, for this lofty aim, martial law and the military
    censorship (measures which even now, in wartime, are applied against the
    “internal” foe more harshly than against the external), the more
    pressingly is it the duty of the class-conscious proletariat to defend its
    class solidarity, its internationalism, and its socialist convictions
    against the unbridled chauvinism of the “patriotic” bourgeois
    cliques in all countries. If class-conscious workers were to give up this
    aim, this would mean renunciation of their aspirations for freedom and
    democracy, to say nothing of their socialist aspirations.


It is with a feeling of the most bitter disappointment that we have to
    record that the socialist parties of the leading European countries have
    failed to discharge this duty, the behaviour of these parties’
    leaders, particularly in Germany, bordering on downright betrayal of the
    cause of socialism. At this time of supreme and historic importance, most of
    the leaders of the present Socialist International, the Second (1889-1914),
    are trying to substitute nationalism for socialism. As a result of their
    behaviour, the workers’ parties of these countries did not oppose the
    governments’ criminal conduct, but called upon the working class to
    identify its position with that of the imperialist governments. The leaders
    of the International committed an act of treachery against socialism by
    voting for war credits, by reiterating the chauvinist
    (“patriotic”) slogans of the bourgeoisie of their
    “own” countries, by justifying and defending the war, by joining
    the bourgeois governments of the belligerent countries, and so on and so
    forth. The most influential socialist leaders and the most influential
    organs of the socialist press of present-day Europe hold views that are
    chauvinist, bourgeois and liberal, and in no way socialist. The
    responsibility for thus disgracing socialism falls primarily on the German
    Social-Democrats, who were the strongest and most influential party in the
    Second International. But neither can one justify the French socialists, who
    have accepted ministerial posts in the government of that very bourgeoisie
    which betrayed its country and allied itself with Bismarck so as to crush
    the Commune.

 

The German and the Austrian Social-Democrats are attempting to justify
      their support for the war by arguing that they are thereby fighting
      against Russian tsarism. We Russian Social-Democrats declare that we
      consider such justification sheer sophistry. In our country the
      revolutionary movement against tsarism has again assumed tremendous
      proportions during the past few years. This movement has always been
      headed by the working class of Russia. The political strikes of the last
      few years, which have involved millions of workers, have had as their
      slogan the overthrow of tsarism and the establishment of a democratic
      republic. During his visit to Nicholas II on the very eve of the war,
      Poincaré, President of the French Republic, could see for himself, in
      the streets of St. Petersburg, barricades put up by Russian workers. The
      Russian proletariat has not flinched from any sacrifice to rid humanity of
      the disgrace of the tsarist monarchy. We must, however, say that if there
      is anything that, under certain conditions, can delay the downfall of
      tsarism, anything that can help tsarism in its struggle against the whole
      of Russia’s democracy, then that is the present war, which has
      placed the purses of the British, the French and the Russian bourgeois at
      the disposal of tsarism, to further the latter’s reactionary
      aims. If there is anything that can hinder the revolutionary struggle of
      the Russia’s working class against tsarism, then that is the
      behaviour of the German and the Austrian Social-Democratic leaders, which
      the chauvinist press of Russia is continually holding up to us as an
      example.


Even assuming that German Social-Democracy was so weak that it was
    compelled to refrain from all revolutionary action, it should not have
    joined the chauvinist camp, or taken steps which gave the Italian socialists
    reason to say that the German Social-Democratic leaders were dishonouring
    the banner of the proletarian International.


Our Party, the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party, has made, and will
    continue to make great sacrifices in connection with the war. The whole of
    our working-class legal press has been suppressed. Most working-class
    associations have been disbanded, and a large number of our comrades have
    been arrested and exiled. Yet our parliamentary representatives—the
    Russian Social-Democratic Labour

    

group in the Duma—considered it their
    imperative socialist duty not to vote for the war credits, and even to walk
    out of the Duma, so as to express their protest the more energetically; they
    considered it their duty to brand the European governments’ policy as
    imperialist. Though the tsar’s government has increased its tyranny
    tenfold, the Social-Democratic workers of Russia are already publishing
    their first illegal manifestos against the war, thus doing their duty to
    democracy and to the International.


While the collapse of the Second International has given rise to a sense
    of burning shame in revolutionary Social-Democrats—as represented by
    the minority of German Social-Democrats and the finest Social-Democrats in
    the neutral countries; while socialists in both Britain and France have been
    speaking up against the chauvinism of most Social-Democratic parties; while
    the opportunists, as represented, for instance, by the German
    Sozialistische Monatshefte, which have long held a national-liberal
    stand, are with good reason celebrating their victory over European
    socialism—the worst possible service is being rendered to the
    proletariat by those who vacillate between opportunism and revolutionary
    Social-Democracy (like the “Centre” in the German
    Social-Democratic Party), by those who are trying to hush up the collapse of
    the Second International or to disguise it with diplomatic phrases.


On the contrary, this collapse must be frankly recognised and its causes
    understood, so as to make it possible to build up a new and more lasting
    socialist unity of the workers of all countries.


The opportunists have wrecked the decisions of the Stuttgart, Copenhagen
    and Basle
congresses,[1] which made it binding on socialists of all
    countries to combat chauvinism in all and any conditions, made it binding on
    socialists to reply to any war begun by the bourgeoisie and governments,
    with intensified propaganda of civil war and social revolution. The collapse
    of the Second International is the collapse of opportunism, which developed
    from the features of a now bygone (and so-called “peaceful”)
    period of history, and in recent years has come practically to dominate the
    International. The opportunist have long been preparing the ground for this
    collapse by denying the socialist

    

revolution and substituting bourgeois
    reformism in its stead; by rejecting the class struggle with its inevitable
    conversion at certain moments into civil war, and by preaching class
    collaboration; by preaching bourgeois chauvinism under the guise of
    patriotism and the defence of the fatherland, and ignoring or rejecting the
    fundamental truth of socialism, long ago set forth in the 
    Communist Manifesto, that the workingmen have no country; by
    confining themselves, in the struggle against militarism, to a sentimental,
    philistine point of view, instead of recognising the need for a
    revolutionary war by the proletarians of all countries, against the
    bourgeoisie of all countries; by making a fetish of the necessary
    utilisation of bourgeois parliamentarianism and bourgeois legality, and
    forgetting that illegal forms of organisation and propaganda are imperative
    at times of crises. The natural “appendage” to
    opportunism—one that is just as bourgeois and hostile to the
    proletarian, i.e., the Marxist, point of view—namely, the
    anarcho-syndicalist trend, has been marked by a no less shamefully smug
    reiteration of the slogans of chauvinism, during the present crisis.


The aims of socialism at the present time cannot be fulfilled, and real
    international unity of the workers cannot be achieved, without a decisive
    break with opportunism, and without explaining its inevitable fiasco to the
    masses.


It must be the primary task of Social-Democrats in every country to
    combat that country’s chauvinism. In Russia this chauvinism has
    overcome the bourgeois liberals (the
    “Constitutional-Democrats”), and part of the
    Narodniks—down to the
Socialist-Revolutionaries[2] and the
    “Right” Social-Democrats. (In particular, the chauvinist
    utterances of E. Smirnov, P. Maslov and G. Plekhanov, for example, should be
    branded; they have been taken up and widely used by the bourgeois
    “patriotic” press.)


In the present situation, it is impossible to determine, from the
    standpoint of the international proletariat, the defeat of which of the two
    groups of belligerent nations would be the lesser evil for socialism. But to
    us Russian Social-Democrats there cannot be the slightest doubt that, from
    the standpoint of the working class and of the toiling masses of all the
    nations of Russia, the defeat of the tsarist

    

monarchy, the most reactionary
    and barbarous of governments, which is oppressing the largest number of
    nations and the greatest mass of the population of Europe and Asia, would be
    the lesser evil.


The formation of a republican United States of Europe should be the
    immediate political slogan of Europe’s Social-Democrats. In contrast
    with the bourgeoisie, which is ready to “promise” anything in
    order to draw the proletariat into the mainstream of chauvinism, the
    Social-Democrats will explain that this slogan is absolutely false and
    meaningless without the revolutionary overthrow of the German, the Austrian
    and the Russian monarchies. 

Since Russia is most backward and has not yet completed its bourgeois
    revolution, it still remains the task of Social-Democrats in that country to
    achieve the three fundamental conditions for consistent democratic reform,
    viz., a democratic republic (with complete equality and self-determination
    for all nations), confiscation of the landed estates, and an eight-hour
    working day. But in all the advanced countries the war has placed on the
    order of the day the slogan of socialist revolution, a slogan that is the
    more urgent, the more heavily the burden of war presses upon the shoulders
    of the proletariat, and the more active its future role must become in the
    re-creation of Europe, after the horrors of the present
    “patriotic” barbarism in conditions of the tremendous
    technological progress of large-scale capitalism. The bourgeoisie’s
    use of wartime laws to gag the proletariat makes it imperative for the
    latter to create illegal forms of agitation and organisation. Let the
    opportunists “preserve” the legal organisations at the price of
    treachery to their convictions—revolutionary Social-Democrats will
    utilise the organisational experience and links of the working class so as
    to create illegal forms of struggle for socialism, forms appropriate to a
    period of crisis, and to unite the workers, not with the chauvinist
    bourgeoisie of their respective countries, but with the workers of all
    countries. The proletarian International has not gone under and will not go
    under. Notwithstanding all obstacles, the masses of the workers will create
    a new International. Opportunism’s present triumph will be
    short-lived. The greater the sacrifices imposed by the war the clearer will
    it become to the mass of the workers

    

that the opportunists have betrayed the
    workers’ cause and that the weapons must be turned against the
    government and the bourgeoisie of each country. 

The conversion of the present imperialist war into a civil war is the
    only correct proletarian slogan, one that follows from the experience of the
    Commune, and outlined in the Basle resolution (1912); it bas been dictated
    by all the conditions of an imperialist war between highly developed
    bourgeois countries. However difficult that transformation may seem at any
    given moment, socialists will never relinquish systematic, persistent and
    undeviating preparatory work in this direction now that war has become a
    fact. 

It is only along this path that the proletariat will be able to shake off
    its dependence on the chauvinist bourgeoisie, and, in one form or another
    and more or less rapidly, take decisivo steps towards genuine freedom for
    the nations and towards socialism. 

Long live the international fraternity of the workers against the
    chauvinism and patriotism of the bourgeoisie of all countries! 

Long live a proletarian International, freed from
    opportunism!

The
    Stuttgart Congress of the Second Internationalwas held on August 18–24,
    1907. The R.S.D.L.P. delegation consisted of 37 members, the Bolshevik
    delegates including Lenin, Lunacharsky and Litvinov. 
The Congress conducted its main work in committees set up
    to draft resolutions for the plenary meetings. Lenin worked on the committee
    which drafted a resolution on “Militarism and International
    Conflicts”. Lenin and Rosa Luxemburg introduced into Bebel’s
    draft the historic amendment on the duty of the socialists to use the
    war-created crisis to arouse the masses for the overthrow of capitalism. The
    amendment was adopted by the Congress (concerning the Congress, see
    Lenin’s articles “The International Socialist Congress in
    Stuttgart” in Volume 13 of the present edition, pp. 75-81 and 82-93).
    
The Copenhagen Congress of the Second
    International was held between August 28 and September 3, 1910, the
    R.S.D.L.P: being represented by Lenin, Plekhanov, Lunacharsky, Kollontai,
    Pokrovsky and others. The Congress appointed, several committees for
    preliminary discussion and drafting of resolutions on the agenda
    items. Lenin worked on the co-operative committee. 
The Congress’s resolution “The Struggle
    Against Militarism and War” confirmed the Stuttgart Congress’s
    resolution on “Militarism and International Conflicts” and listed
    the demands to be advanced by the socialist parliamentary deputies: (a) all
    conflicts between states to be unfailingly submitted for settlement by
    international courts of arbitration, (b) general disarmament; (c) abolition
    of secret diplomacy; (d) autonomy for all nations and their protection
    against military attacks and oppression. 

The Basle Congress of the Second
    International was held on November 24–25, 1912. It was the extraordinary
    congress called in connection with the Balkan War and the imminent European
    war. The Congress adopted a manifesto emphasising the imperialist nature of
    the approaching world war, and called on the socialists of all countries to
    wage a vigorous struggle against war. (The Basle Manifesto is discussed on
    pp. 208-17, 307-08
    in this volume.)

Socialist-Revolutionaries—a peasant-based party in Russia,
    founded at the end of 1901 and the beginning of 1902 as a result of the
    union of various Narodnik groups and circles (Union of Socialist
    Revolutionaries, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, etc.). The newspaper
    Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia ) (1900-05)
    and the journal Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii (Herald of the
    Russian Revolution ) (1901-05) became its official organs. The
    Socialist-Revolutionaries did not recognise the class differences between
    the proletariat and the petty proprietors, glossed over the class
    contradictions within the peasantry, and rejected the proletariat’s
    leading role in the revolution. The Socialist-Revolutionaries’ views
    were an eclectic mixture of the ideas of Narodism and revisionism; they
    tried, as Lenin put it, to patch up “the rents in the Narodnik ideas
    with bits of fashionable opportunist “criticism” of
    Marxism” (see present edition, Vol. 9, p. 310). 
The Bolshevik Party exposed the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries’ attempts to masquerade as socialists,
    conducted a determined struggle against the Socialist-Revolutionaries for
    influence over the peasantry, and showed how dangerous their tactic of
    individual terrorism was to the working-class movement. At the same time the
    Bolsheviks were prepared, on definite conditions, to enter into temporary
    agreements with the Socialist-Revolutionaries in the struggle against
    tsarism. As early as the first Russian revolution (1905-07), the Right wing
    of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party broke away and formed the legal
    Popular-Socialist Party, whose outlook was close to that of the Cadets, the
    Left wing forming the semi-anarchist league of Maximalists. In the period of
    reaction between 1907 and 1910, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party suffered a
    complete ideological and organisational breakdown. During the First World
    War most of its members took a social-chauvinist position.

What a lot of talk, argument and vociferation there is nowadays about
      nationality and the fatherland! Liberal and radical cabinet ministers in
      Britain, a host of “forward-looking” journalists in France (who
      have proved in full agreement with their reactionary colleagues), and a
      swarm of official Cadet and progressive scribblers in Russia (including
      several Narodniks and “Marxists”)—all have effusive
      praise for the liberty and independence of their respective countries, the
      grandeur of the principle of national independence. Here one cannot tell
      where the venal eulogist of the butcher Nicholas
Romanov[1] or of the brutal
      oppressors of Negroes and Indians ends, and where the common philistine
      begins, who from sheer stupidity or spinelessness drifts with the streams,
      begins. Nor is that distinction important. We see before us an extensive
      and very deep ideological trend, whose origins are closely interwoven with
      the interests of the landowners and the capitalists of the dominant
      nations. Scores and hundreds of millions are being spent every year for
      the propaganda of ideas advantageous to those classes: it is a pretty big
      mill-race that takes its waters from all sources—from Menshikov, a
      chauvinist by conviction, to chauvinists for reason of opportunism or
      spinelessness such as Plekhanov and Maslov, Rubanovich and Smirnov,
      Kropotkin and Burtsev. 

Let us, Great-Russian Social-Democrats, also try to define our attitude
      to this ideological trend. It would be unseemly for us, representatives of
      a dominant nation in the far east of Europe and a goodly part of Asia, to
      forget the immense significance of the national question—especially

    

in a country which has been rightly called the “prison of the
      peoples”, and particularly at a time when, in the far east of Europe
      and in Asia, capitalism is awakening to life and self-consciousness a
      number of #8220;new” nations, large and small; at a moment when the
      tsarist monarchy has called up millions of Great Russians and
      non-Russians, so as to “solve” a number of national problems in
      accordance with the interests of the Council of the United
Nobility[2] and of
      the Guchkovs, Krestovnikovs, Dolgorukovs, Kutlers and Rodichevs. 

Is a sense of national pride alien to us, Great-Russian class-conscious
    proletarians? Certainly not! We love our language and our country, and we
    are doing our very utmost to raise her toiling masses (i.e.,
    nine-tenths of her population) to the level of a democratic and
    socialist consciousness. To us it is most painful to see and feel the
    outrages, the oppression and the humiliation our fair country suffers at the
    hands of the tsar’s butchers, the nobles and the capitalists. We take
    pride in the resistance to these outrages put up from our midst, from the
    Great Russians; in that midst having produced
Radishchev,[3] the
Decembrists[4] and the revolutionary commoners of the
seventies[5]; in the Great-Russian working class having
    created, in 1905, a mighty revolutionary party of the masses; and in the
    Great-Russian peasantry having begun to turn towards democracy and set about
    overthrowing the clergy and the landed proprietors. 

We remember that Chernyshevsky, the Great-Russian democrat, who dedicated
    his life to the cause of revolution, said half a century ago: “A
    wretched nation, a nation of slaves, from top to bottom—all
slaves."[6] The
    overt and covert Great-Russian slaves (slaves with regard to the tsarist
    monarchy) do not like to recall these words. Yet, in our opinion, these were
    words of genuine love for our country, a love distressed by the absence of a
    revolutionary spirit in the masses of the Great-Russian people. There was
    none of that spirit at the time. There is little of it now, but it already
    exists. We are full of national pride because the Great-Russian nation,
    too, has created a revolutionary class, because it, too,
    has proved capable of providing mankind with great models of the struggle
    for freedom and socialism, and not only with great pogroms, rows of

    

gallows,
    dungeons, great famines and great servility to priests, tsars, landowners
    and capitalists.

We are full of a sense of national pride, and for that very reason we
      particularly hate our slavish past (when the landed
      nobility led the peasants into war to stifle the freedom of Hungary,
      Poland, Persia and China), and our slavish present, when these selfsame
      landed proprietors, aided by the capitalists, are loading us into a war in
      order to throttle Poland and the Ukraine, crush the democratic movement in
      Persia and China, and strengthen the gang of Romanovs, Bobrinskys and
      Purishkeviches, who are a disgrace to our Great-Russian national
      dignity. Nobody is to be blamed for being born a slave; but a slave who
      not only eschews a striving for freedom but justifies and eulogises his
      slavery (e.g., calls the throttling of Poland and the Ukraine, etc., a
      “defence of the fatherland” of the Great Russians)—such a
      slave is a lickspittle and a boor, who arouses a legitimate feeling of
      indignation, contempt, and loathing. 

"No nation can be free if it oppresses other nations,” said Marx and
    Engels, the greatest representatives of consistent nineteenth century
    democracy, who became the teachers of the revolutionary proletariat. And,
    full of a sense of national pride, we Great-Russian workers want, come what
    may, a free and independent, a democratic, republican and proud Great
    Russia, one that will base its relations with its neighbours on the human
    principle of equality, and not on the feudalist principle of privilege,
    which is so degrading to a great nation. Just because we want that, we say:
    it is impossible, in the twentieth century and in Europe (even in the far
    east of Europe), to “defend the fatherland” otherwise than by
    using every revolutionary means to combat the monarchy, the landowners and
    the capitalists of one’s own fatherland, i.e., the worst
    enemies of our country. We say that the Great Russians cannot “defend
    the fatherland” otherwise than by desiring the defeat of tsarism in any
    war, this as the lesser evil to nine-tenths of the inhabitants of Great
    Russia. For tsarism not only oppresses those nine-tenths economically and
    politically, but also demoralises, degrades, dishonours and prostitutes them
    by teaching them to oppress other nations and to cover up this shame with
    hypocritical and quasi-patriotic phrases.
 

The objection may be advanced that, besides tsarism and under its wing,
      another historical force has arisen and become strong, viz., Great-Russian
      capitalism, which is carrying on progressive work by economically
      centralising and welding together vast regions. This objection, however,
      does not excuse, but on the contrary still more condemns our
      socialist-chauvinists, who should be called tsarist-Purishkevich
      socialists[7] (just as Marx called the Lassalleans
      Royal-Prussian
socialists).[8] Let us even assume that history will decide in
      favour of Great-Russian dominant-nation capitalism, and against the
      hundred and one small nations. That is not impossible, for the entire
      history of capital is one of violence and plunder, blood and
      corruption. We do not advocate preserving small nations at all costs;
      other conditions being equal, we are decidedly for centralisation
      and are opposed to the petty-bourgeois ideal of federal
      relationships. Even if our assumption were true, however, it is, firstly,
      not our business, or that of democrats (let alone of socialists), to help
      Romanov-Bobrinsky-Purishkevich throttle the Ukraine, etc. In his own
      Junker fashion, Bismarck accomplished a progressive historical task, but
      he would be a fine “Marxist” indeed who, on such grounds,
      thought of justifying socialist support for Bismarck! Moreover, Bismarck
      promoted economic development by bringing together the disunited Germans,
      who were being oppressed by other nations. The economic prosperity and
      rapid development of Great Russia, however, require that the country be
      liberated from Great-Russian oppression of other nations—that is the
      difference that our admirers of the true-Russian would-be Bismarcks
      overlook. 

Secondly, if history were to decide in favour of Great Russian
      dominant-nation capitalism, it follows hence that the socialist
      role of the Great-Russian proletariat, as the principal driving force of the
      communist revolution engendered by capitalism, will be all the greater. The
      proletarian revolution calls for a prolonged education of the workers in the
      spirit of the fullest national equality and
      brotherhood. Consequently, the interests of the Great-Russian proletariat
      require that the masses be systematically educated to champion—most
      resolutely, consistently, boldly and in a revolutionary
      manner—complete equality and the right to self-determination for all
      the nations oppressed

    

by the Great Russians. The interests of the Great
      Russians’ national pride (understood, not in the slavish sense)
      coincide with the socialist interests of the Great-Russian (and all
      other) proletarians. Our model will always be Marx, who, after living in
      Britain for decades and becoming half-English, demanded freedom and national
      independence for Ireland in the interests of the socialist movement of the
      British workers. 

In the second hypothetical case we have considered, our home-grown
      socialist-chauvinists, Plekhanov, etc., etc., will prove traitors, not only
      to their own country—a free and democratic Great Russia, but also to
      the proletarian brotherhood of all the nations of Russia, i.e., to the cause
      of socialism.

In No. 40 of Sotsial-Demokrat we reported that a
    conference of our-Party’s groups abroad had decided to defer the
    question of the “United States of Europe” slogan pending a
    discussion, in the press, on the economic aspect of the
matter.[1]

At our conference the debate on this question assumed a purely political
    character. Perhaps this was partly caused by the Central Committee’s
    Manifesto having formulated this slogan as a forthright political one
    (“the immediate political slogan...”, as it says
    there); not only did it advance the slogan of a republican United States of
    Europe, but expressly emphasised that this slogan is meaningless and false
    “without the revolutionary overthrow of the German, Austrian and
    Russian monarchies”.

It would be quite wrong to object to such a presentation of the question
    within the limits of a political appraisal of this
    slogan—e.g., to argue that it obscures or weakens, etc., the slogan of
    a socialist revolution. Political changes of a truly democratic nature, and
    especially political revolutions, can under no circumstances whatsoever
    either obscure or weaken the slogan of a socialist revolution. On the
    contrary, they always bring it closer, extend its basis, and draw new
    sections of the petty bourgeoisie and the semi-proletarian masses into the
    socialist struggle. On the other hand, political revolutions are inevitable
    in the course of the socialist revolution, which should not be regarded as a
    single act, but as a period of turbulent political and

    

      economic upheavals,
    the most intense class struggle, civil war, revolutions, and
    counter-revolutions.

But while the slogan of a republican United States of Europe—if
    accompanied by the revolutionary overthrow of the three most reactionary
    monarchies in Europe, headed by the Russian—is quite invulnerable as a
    political slogan, there still remains the highly important question of its
    economic content and significance. From the standpoint of the economic
    conditions of imperialism—i.e., the export of capital and the
    division of the world by the “advanced” and
    “civilised” colonial powers—a United States of Europe,
    under capitalism, is either impossible or reactionary.

Capital has become international and monopolist. The world has been
    carved up by a handful of Great Powers, i.e., powers successful in the great
    plunder and oppression of nations. The four Great Powers of
    Europe—Britain, France, Russia and Germany, with an aggregate
    population of between 250,000,000 and 300,000,000, and an area of about
    7,000,000 square kilometres—possess colonies with a population of
    almost 500 million (494,500,000) and an area of 64,600,000 square
    kilometres, i.e., almost half the surface of the globe (133,000,000 square
    kilometres, exclusive of Arctic and Antarctic regions). Add to this the
    three Asian states—China, Turkey and Persia, now being rent piecemeal
    by thugs that are waging a war of “liberation”, namely, Japan,
    Russia, Britain and France. Those three Asian states, which may be called
    semi-colonies (in reality they are now 90 per cent colonies), have a total
    population of 360,000,000 and an area of 14,500,000 square kilometres
    (almost one and a half times the area of all Europe).

Furthermore, Britain, France and Germany have invested capital abroad to
    the value of no less than 70,000 million rubles. The business of securing
    “legitimate” profits from this tidy sum—these exceed 3,000
    million rubles annually—committees of the millionaires, known as
    governments, which are equipped with armies and navies and which provide the
    sons and brothers of the millionaires with jobs in the colonies and
    semi-colonies as viceroys, consuls, ambassadors, officials of all kinds,
    clergymen, and other leeches.

 

That is how the plunder of about a thousand million of the earth’s
    population by a handful of Great Powers is organised in the epoch of the
    highest development of capitalism. No other organisation is possible under
    capitalism. Renounce colonies, “spheres of influence”, and the
    export of capital? To think that it is possible means coming down to the
    level of some snivelling parson who every Sunday preaches to the rich on the
    lofty principles of Christianity and advises them to give the poor, well, if
    not millions, at least several hundred rubles yearly.

A United States of Europe under capitalism is tantamount to an agreement
    on the partition of colonies. Under capitalism, however, no other basis and
    no other principle of division are possible except force. A
    multi-millionaire cannot share the “national income” of a
    capitalist country with anyone otherwise than “in proportion to the
    capital invested” (with a bonus thrown in, so that the biggest capital
    may receive more than its share). Capitalism is private ownership of the
    means of production, and anarchy in production. To advocate a
    “just” division of income on such a basis is sheer Proudhonism,
    stupid philistinism. No division can be effected otherwise than in
    “proportion to strength”, and strength changes with the course
    of economic development. Following 1871, the rate of Germany’s
    accession of strength was three or four times as rapid as that of Britain
    and France, and of Japan about ten times as rapid as Russia’s. There
    is and there can be no other way of testing the real might of a capitalist
    state than by war. War does not contradict the fundamentals of private
    property—on the contrary, it is a direct and inevitable outcome of
    those fundamentals. Under capitalism the smooth economic growth of
    individual enterprises or individual states is impossible. Under capitalism,
    there are no other means of restoring the periodically disturbed equilibrium
    than crises in industry and wars in politics.

Of course, temporary agreements are possible between capitalists
    and between states. In this sense a United States of Europe is possible as
    an agreement between the European capitalists ... but to what end?
    Only for the purpose of jointly suppressing socialism in Europe, of jointly
    protecting colonial booty against Japan and America, who

    

      have been
    badly done out of their share by the present partition of colonies, and the
    increase of whose might during the last fifty years has been immeasurably
    more rapid than that of backward and monarchist Europe, now turning
    senile. Compared with the United States of America, Europe as a whole
    denotes economic stagnation. On the present economic basis, i.e., under
    capitalism, a United States of Europe would signify an organisation of
    reaction to retard America’s more rapid development. The times when
    the cause of democracy and socialism was associated only with Europe alone
    have gone for ever.

A United States of the World (not of Europe alone) is the state form of
    the unification and freedom of nations which we associate with
    socialism—about the total disappearance of the state, including the
    democratic. As a separate slogan, however, the slogan of a United States of
    the World would hardly be a correct one, first, because it merges with
    socialism; second, because it may be wrongly interpreted to mean that the
    victory of socialism in a single country is impossible, and it may also
    create misconceptions as to the relations of such a country to the
    others.

Uneven economic and political development is an absolute law of
    capitalism. Hence, the victory of socialism is possible first in several or
    even in one capitalist country alone. After expropriating the capitalists
    and organising their own socialist production, the victorious proletariat of
    that country will arise against the rest of the world—the capitalist
    world—attracting to its cause the oppressed classes of other
    countries, stirring uprisings in those countries against the capitalists,
    and in case of need using even armed force against the exploiting classes
    and their states. The political form of a society wherein the proletariat is
    victorious in overthrowing the bourgeoisie will be a democratic republic,
    which will more and more concentrate the forces of the proletariat of a
    given nation or nations, in the struggle against states that have not yet
    gone over to socialism. The abolition of classes is impossible without a
    dictatorship of the oppressed class, of the proletariat. A free union of
    nations in socialism is impossible without a more or less prolonged and
    stubborn

    

      struggle of the socialist republics against the backward
    states.

It is for these reasons and after repeated discussions at the conference
    of R,S.D.L.P. groups abroad, and following that conference, that the Central
    Organ’s editors have come to the conclusion that the slogan for a
    United States of Europe is an erroneous one.

The demand for a United States of Europe, as advanced by the
    Central Committee’s Manifesto, which accompanied it with a call for
    the overthrow of the monarchies in Russia, Austria, and Germany, is distinct
    from the pacifist interpretation of this slogan by Kautsky and others.

Issue No. 44 of Sotsial-Demokrat, our Party’s Central
    Organ, carries an editorial proving the economic erroneousness of the
    United States of Europe
slogan.[1]

 Either this is a demand that cannot be
    implemented under capitalism, inasmuch as it presupposes the establishment
    of a planned world economy, with a partition of colonies, spheres of
    influence, etc., among the individual countries, or else it is a reactionary
    slogan, one that signifies a temporary union of the Great Powers of Europe
    with the aim of enhancing the oppression of colonies and of plundering the
    more rapidly developing countries-Japan and America.

The old
Economism[9] of 1894–1902 reasoned thus: the
Narodniks[10] have been refuted; capitalism has triumphed in
Russia. Consequently, there can be no question of political revolution. The
practical conclusion: either “economic struggle be left to the workers and
political struggle to the liberals”—that is a curvet to the right—or,
instead of political revolution, a general strike for socialist
revolution. That curvet to the left was advocated in a pamphlet, now
forgotten, of a Russian Economist of the late
nineties.[11] 

Now a new Economism is being born. Its reasoning is similarly based on
the two curvets: “Right”—we are against the “right to
self-determination” (i.e., against the liberation of oppressed peoples,
the struggle against annexations—that has not yet been fully thought out
or clearly stated). “Left”—we are opposed to a minimum programme
(i. e., opposed to struggle for reforms and democracy) as “contradictory”
to socialist revolution.  

It is more than a year now since this nascent trend was revealed to
several comrades at the Berne Conference in the spring of 1915. At that
time, happily, only one comrade, who met with universal
disapproval, insisted on these ideas of imperialist Economism right up to
the end of the Conference and formulated them in writing in special
“theses”. No one associated himself with these
theses.[12] 

Subsequently two others associated themselves with this comrade’s
theses against self-determination (unaware that the question was
inextricably linked with the general line of the afore-mentioned
“theses”).[13] But the appearance of the “Dutch programme” in February
1916, published in No. 3 of the Bulletin of the International Socialist
=

Committee,[14]
    

immediately brought out this “misunderstanding” and
again compelled the author of the original theses to
restate his imperialist Economism, this time, too, as a whole, and
not merely in application to one allegedly “partial” issue.  

It is absolutely necessary again and again to warn the
comrades concerned that they have landed themselves in a quagmire,
that their “ideas” have nothing in common either with Marxism or
revolutionary Social-Democracy. We can no longer leave the matter “in
the dark”: that would only encourage ideological confusion and direct it
into the worst possible channel of equivocation, “private”
conflicts, incessant “friction”, etc. Our duty, on the contrary, is to
insist, in the most emphatic and categorical manner, on the
obligation thoroughly to think out and analyse questions raised
for discussion.  

In its theses on
self-determination[1]

(which appeared in German as a reprint from No. 2 of
Vorbote[15]), the
Sotsial-Demokrat[16] editorial board purposely brought the matter
into the press in an impersonal, but most detailed, form,
emphasising in particular the link between self-determination and
the general question of the struggle for reforms, for democracy,
the impermissibility of ignoring the political aspect, etc. In his
comments on the editorial board’s theses, the author of the original theses
(imperialist Economism) comes out in solidarity with the Dutch
programme, thereby clearly demonstrating that self-determination is by
no means a “partial” question, as exponents of the nascent trend
maintain, but a general and basic one.  

The Dutch programme was laid before representatives of the Zimmerwald
Left[17] on February 5–8, 1916, at the Berne meeting of the
International Socialist
Committee.[18] Not a single member of the Zimmerwald Left, not even
Radek, spoke in favour of the programme, for it combines,
indiscriminately, such points as “expropriation of the banks” and
“repeal of customs tariffs”, “abolition of the first Senate chamber”,
etc. The Zimmerwald Left unanimously, with practically no comment, in fact
merely with a shrug of the shoulders, dismissed the Dutch programme as
patently and wholly unsuitable.  
 

However, the author of the original theses, written in the spring of
1915, was so fond of the programme that he declared: “Substantially, that
is all I said, too



[in the spring of
1915],[2]

“the Dutch have thought things out”: “with them the
economic aspect is expropriation of the banks and large-scale
production [enterprises], the political aspect is a
republic and so on. Absolutely correct!” 

The fact, however, is that the Dutch did not “think things out”, but
produced an unthought out programme. It is the sad fate of Russia
that some among us grasp at precisely what is not thought out in the newest
novelty....  

The author of the 1915 theses believes that the Sotsial
Demokrat editors lapsed into a contradiction when they “themselves”
urged “expropriation of the banks”, and even added the word
“immediately” (plus “dictatorial measures”) in § 8 (“Concrete
Measures”). “And how I was reproached for this very thing in Berne!” the
author of the 1915 theses exclaims indignantly, recalling the Berne debates
in the spring of 1915.  

He forgets or fails to see this “minor” point: in §8 the
Sotsial-Demokrat editors clearly distinguish two
eventualities:
I. The socialist revolution has begun. In that event, they say:
“immediate expropriation of the banks”, etc.
II. The socialist revolution has not begun, and in that event we
shall have to postpone talking about these good things.  

Since the socialist revolution, in the above-mentioned sense, has
obviously not yet begun, the Dutch programme is incongruous. And
the author of the theses adds his bit of “profundity” by
reverting (he always seems to slip on the same spot!) to his old mistake of
turning political demands (like “abolition of the first chamber”?)  into
a “political formula for social revolution”.  

Having marked time for a whole year, the author returned to his old
mistake. That is the “crux” of his misadventures: he cannot solve the
problem of how to link the advent of imperialism with the struggle for
reforms and democracy— just as the Economism of blessed memory could
not link the advent of capitalism with the struggle for democracy.  
 

Hence—complete confusion concerning the “unachievability” of
democratic demands under imperialism.  

Hence—ignoring of the political struggle now, at present,
immediately, and at all times, which is impermissible for a Marxist (and
permissible only for a Rabochaya
Mysl[19] Economist).  

Hence—the knack of persistently “sliding” from recognition
of imperialism to apology for imperialism (just as the Economists
of blessed memory slid from recognition of capitalism to apology for
capitalism).  

And so on, and so forth.  

A detailed examination of the errors the author of the 1915 theses
commits in his comments on the Sotsial-Demokrat self-determination
theses is impossible, for every line is wrong! After all, you
cannot write pamphlets or books in reply to “comments” if the initiators
of imperialist Economism spend a whole year marking time and stubbornly
refuse to concern themselves with what ought to be their direct party duty
if they want to take a serious attitude to political, issues, namely: a
considered and articulate statement of what they designate as “our
differences”.  

I am therefore obliged to confine myself to a brief review of how the
author applies his basic error and how he “supplements” it.  

He believes that I contradict myself: in 1914 (in
Prosveshcheniye[20]) I wrote that it was absurd to look for
self-determination “in the

programmes of West-European
socialists”,[3]

but in 1916 I proclaim self-determination to be especially urgent.  

It did not occur (!!) to the author that these “programmes” were
drawn up in 1875 1880,
1891![21] 

Now let us take his objections (to the Sotsial-Demokrat
self-determination theses) point by point.  

§1. The same Economist refusal to see and pose political
questions. Since socialism creates the economic basis for the
abolition of national oppression in the political sphere,
therefore our author refuses to formulate our political
tasks in this sphere! That’s ridiculous!  
 

Since the victorious proletariat does not negate wars against
the bourgeoisie of other countries, therefore the author refuses
to formulate our political tasks in relation to national oppression!! These
are all examples of downright violation of Marxism and logic, or, if you
like, manifestations of the logic of the fundamental errors of
imperialist Economism.  

§2. The opponents of self-determination are hopelessly confused in
their references to its being “unachievable”.  

The Sotsial-Demokrat editors explain to them two
possible interpretations of unachievability and their error in
both cases.  

Yet the author of the 1915 theses, without even trying to give
his interpretation of “unachievability”, i. e.,
accepting our explanation that two different things are confused
here, persists in that confusion!!  

He ties crises to “imperialist” “policy”: our expert on political
economy has forgotten that there were crises before
imperialism!  

To maintain that self-determination is unachievable economically is to
confuse the issue, the editors explain. The author does not reply,
does not state that he considers self-determination unachievable
economically; he abandons his dubious position and jumps over to
politics (unachievable “all the same”) though he has been told with the
utmost clarity that politically a republic is just as
“unachievable” under imperialism as self-determination.  

Cornered, the author “jumps” again: he accepts a republic and the
whole minimum programme only as a “political formula for social
revolution”!!!  

He refuses to defend the “economic” unachievability of
self-determination and jumps to politics, maintaining that political
unachievability applies to the minimum programme as a whole. Here again
there is not a grain of Marxism, not a grain of logic, save the logic
of imperialist Economism.  

The author wants imperceptibly (without stopping to think,
without producing anything articulate, without making any effort to work
out his programme) to jettison the Social-Democratic Party minimum
programme! No wonder he has been marking time for a whole year!!  

The question of combating Kautskyism is again not a partial,
but a general and basic question of modern times:

    

the author does not understand this struggle. Just as the
Economists turned the struggle against the Narodniks into an apology for
capitalism, so the author turns the struggle against Kautskyism into an
apology for Imperialism (that applies also to §3).  

The mistake of the Kautskyites lies in the fact that they present in a
reformist manner such demands, and at such a time, that can be presented
only in a revolutionary manner (but the author lapses into the position
that their mistake is to advance these demands altogether, just as the
Economists “understood” the struggle against Narodism to mean that the
slogan “Down with the autocracy” was Narodism).  

The mistake of Kautskyism lies in projecting correct
democratic demands into the past, to peaceful capitalism, and not into the
future, to the social revolution (the author, however, falls into the
position of regarding these demands as incorrect).  

§3. See above. The author bypasses also the question of
“federation”. The same old fundamental mistake of the same old Economism:
inability to pose political
      questions.[4]


§4. “From self-determination follows defence of the fatherland,”
the author obstinately repeats. His mistake here is to make negation of
defence of the fatherland a shibboleth, deduce it not
from the concrete historical features of a given war, but apply it
“in general”. That is not Marxism.  

The author has been told long ago—try to think up a formula of
struggle against national oppression or inequality which (formula) does
not justify “defence of the fatherland”. You cannot devise such
a formula, and the author has not challenged that.  

Does that mean that we reject the fight against national oppression if
it could be interpreted to imply defence of the fatherland?  

No, for we are opposed not to “defence of the fatherland” “in
general” (see

our Party
  resolutions),[5]

but to using

    

this fraudulent slogan to embellish the present
imperialist war.  

The author wants to pose the question of “defence of the
fatherland” in a basically incorrect and unhistorical
way (but he cannot; he has been trying in vain for a whole year...).  

His reference to “dualism” shows that he does not under
stand the difference between monism and dualism.  

If I “unite” a shoe brush and a mammal, will that be “monism”?


If I say that to reach goal a we must



    (c)–>a<–(b)
   
 travel to the left from point (b) and to the right from point (c),
will that be “dualism”?  

Is the position of the proletariat with regard to national oppression
the same in oppressing and oppressed nations? No, it is not the same, not
the same economically, politically, ideologically, spiritually,
etc. 

Meaning? 

Meaning that some will approach in one way, others in
another way the same goal (the merger of nations) from
different starting-points. Denial of that is the “monism” that
unites a shoe brush and a mammal.  

“It is not proper to say this [i. e., to urge
self-determination] to the proletarians of an oppressed nation”—that is
how the author “interprets” the editors’ theses.  

That’s amusing!! There is nothing of the kind in the
theses. The author has either not read them to the end or has not given
them any thought at all.  

§5. See above on Kautskyism.  

§6. The author is told there are three types of countries
in the world. He “objects” and snatches out “cases”. That is casuistry,
not politics.  

You want a concrete “case”: “How about Belgium”?  

See the Lenin and Zinoviev
pamphlet[22]: it says that we would be for the defence of
Belgium (even by war) if this concrete war were
    different.[6]

 

You do not agree with that?  

Then say so!!  

You have not properly thought out the question of why
Social-Democrats are against “defence of the fatherland”.  

We are not against it for the reasons you believe, because your
presentation of the question (vain efforts, not really a presentation) goes
against history. That is my reply to the author.  

To describe as “sophistry” the fact that while justifying wars
for the elimination of national oppression, we do not justify the
present imperialist war, which on both sides is being waged to
increase national oppression—is to use “strong” words without
giving the matter the least bit of thought.  

The author wants to pose the question of “defence of the
fatherland” from a more “Left” position, but the result (for a whole
year now) is utter confusion!  

§7. The author criticises: “The question of ‘peace
terms’ is not touched upon at all.”  

Strange criticism: failure to deal with a question we did not even
raise!!  

But what is “touched upon” and discussed is the question of
annexations, on which the imperialist Economists are utterly
confused, this time together with the Dutch and Radek.  

Either you reject the immediate slogan against old and new
annexations—(no less “unachievable” under imperialism than
self-determination, in Europe as well as in the colonies)—and in that
case you pass from concealed to open apology for imperialism.  

Or you accept the slogan (as Radek has done in the press)—and in that
case you accept self-determination of nations under a different name!!


§8. The author proclaims “Bolshevism on a West-European scale”
(“not your position,” he adds).  

I attach no importance to this desire to cling to the word
“Bolshevism”, for I know such “old Bolsheviks” from whom God
save us. I can only say that the author’s proclamation of “Bolshevism on a
West-European scale” is, I am deeply convinced, neither Bolshevism nor
Marxism, but a minor variant of the same old Economism.  
 

In my view it is highly intolerable, flippant and non-Party to proclaim
for a whole year the new Bolshevism and leave things at that. Is
it not time to think matters out and give the comrades an
articulate and integrated expose of “Bolshevism on a
West-European scale”?  

The author has not proved and will not prove the difference between
colonies and oppressed nations in Europe (as applied to the question under
discussion).  


The Dutch and the
P.S.D.[7]

rejection of self-determination is not only, and even not so much,
the result of confusion, for Gorter factually accepts it, and so does the
Zimmerwald statement of the
Poles,[23] but rather the result of the special position of
their nations (small nations with centuries-old
traditions and pretentions to Great-Power status).  

It is extremely thoughtless and naive to take over and mechanically and
uncritically repeat what in others has developed over decades of struggle
against the nationalist bourgeoisie and its deception of the people. Here
we have a case of people taking over precisely what should not be
taken over.

This article and the two that follow it were directed against the
un-Marxist and anti-Bolshevik attitude of the Bukharin-Pyatakov-Bosh group
which began to take shape in the spring of 1915, when preparations were
being made for publication of the magazine Kommunist. It was to be
put out in co-operation with Sotsial-Demokrat.  Y. L. Pyatakov
(P. Kievsky) and Y. B. Bosh undertook to finance tile magazine and
N. I. Bukharin was made one of its editors. Lenin’s differences with the
group were accentuated after the appearance of No. 1–2 of
Kommunist in September 1915. In their theses “On the
Self-Determination Slogan”, which they sent to Sotsial-Demokrat,
Bukharin, Pyatakov and Bosh opposed Lenin’s theory of socialist revolution,
rejected the struggle for democracy in the imperialist era and insisted on
the Party withdrawing its demand for national self-determination.  

The group did not confine itself to theoretical differences and openly
attacked the Party’s policy and slogans. It sought to use
Kommunist in furtherance of its factional aims and tried to
dictate terms to the editors of Sotsial-Demokrat. Pyatakov and
Bosh insisted on the Central Committee Bureau Abroad recognising them as a
separate group not accountable to it and authorised to maintain independent
connections with Central Committee members in Russia and publish leaflets
and other literature. Though this demand was turned down, the group
attempted to establish contact with the Central Committee Bureau in Russia.


Lenin was sharply opposed to the Pyatakov-Bosh-Bukharin theses, saying
that “we can take no responsibility for them, either direct or
indirect—even for harbouring them in the Party, let alone granting them
equality”. In letters to N. I. Bukharin, Y. L. Pyatakov, G. Y. Zinoviev
and A. G. Shlyapnikov, Lenin trenchantly criticised tile group’s views and
anti-Party, factional actions and condemned the conciliatory attitude of
Zinoviev and Shlyapnikov. On his proposal, joint publication of
Kommunist by tile Sotsial Demokrat editors and the group
was discontinued.  

The “Nascent Trend of Imperialist Economism” was written when the
Sotsial-Demokrat editors had received Bukharin’s comments on the
theses “The Socialist Revolution and tile Right of Nations to
Self-Determination”. The article was not published at the time.





[9]

Economism was an opportunist trend in Russian Social-Democracy at
the turn of the century, a Russian variety of international

   

opportunism. The Economists limited the tasks of the working-class movement
to the economic struggle for higher wages, better working conditions, etc.,
maintaining that the political struggle should be left to the liberal
bourgeoisie. They denied the leading role of the working-class
party. Making a fetish of the spontaneity of the working-class movement,
they belittled the importance of revolutionary theory and, by denying the
need for a Marxist party to bring socialist consciousness into the
working-class movement, cleared the way for bourgeois ideology. They
championed the existing disunity, confusion and parochial amateurish
approach in the Social-Democratic ranks, and opposed the creation of a
centralised working-class party.  

Comprehensive criticism by Lenin of the Economist standpoint will be
found in his “A Protest by Russian Social-Democrats”, “A Retrograde
Trend in Russian Social-Democracy”, “Apropos of the Profession de
Foi” and “A Talk with Defenders of Economism” (see present edition,
Vol. 4, pp. 167–82, 255–85, 286–96, and Vol. 5, pp. 313–20). Lenin’s
What Is To Be Done? brought about the ideological rout of
Economism (see present edition, Vol. 5, pp.347–529). A major part in the
struggle against the Economists was also played by the newspaper
Iskra.





[10]

Narodniks—followers of a petty-bourgeois trend, Narodism, in the
Russian revolutionary movement, which arose in the sixties and seventies of
the nineteenth century. The Narodniks stood for the abolition of the
autocracy and the transfer of the landed estates to the peasantry. At the
same time, they believed capitalism in Russia to be a temporary phenomenon
with no prospect of development and they therefore considered the
peasantry, not the proletariat, to be the main revolutionary force in
Russia. They regarded the village commune as the embryo of socialism. With
the object of rousing the peasantry to struggle against the autocracy, the
Narodniks “went among the people”, to the villages, but found no support
there.  

In the eighties and nineties the Narodniks adopted a policy of
conciliation to tsarism, expressed the interests of the kulak class, and
waged a bitter fight against Marxism.





[11]

Reference is to the article “Who Will Perform the Political Revolution?”
in the symposium Proletarian Struggle No. 1, published by the
Urals Social-Democratic Group in 1899. The article was re published as a
pamphlet by the Kiev Committee. The author, A. A. Sanin, an Economist, was
opposed to an independent working-class political party and political
revolution, believing that Russia’s socialist transformation, which he
considered an immediate task, could be accomplished through a general
strike.





[12]

Reference is to the Conference of R.S.D.L.P. groups abroad, held
in Berne between February 14 and 19 (February 27–March 4), 1915. Convened
on Lenin’s initiative, it assumed the character of a

   

general Party conference, since neither a Party congress nor an all-Russia
conference could be convened during the war.  

The Conference was attended by representatives of the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, the R.S.D.L.P. Central Organ,
Sotsial-Demokrat, the Social-Democrat Women’s Organisation and
delegates from R.S.D.L.P. groups in Paris, Zurich, Berne, Lausanne, Geneva,
London and Baugy. All members of the Berne group and several members of the
Lausanne and Baugy groups attended as guests. Lenin was delegated by the
Central Committee and Central Organ and directed the work of the
Conference.  

The main item on the agenda, the war and the tasks of the Party, was
introduced by Lenin, who amplified the propositions set out in the Central
Committee Manifesto, “The War and Russian Social Democracy”. The
resolutions tabled by the Montpellier, and especially the Baugy groups and
adopted by the Conference revealed that some Party members had failed to
grasp the implications of Lenin’s proposition on civil war. They objected
to the slogan of the defeat of one’s “own” government and advanced their
own slogan of peace, and failed to appreciate the need and importance of
combating Centrism. All these questions were thrashed out in the debate,
and Lenin’s theses were unanimously approved. Only Bukharin persistently
supported the erroneous views of the Baugy resolution and objected to the
slogans Lenin had formulated for the Party and the international
Social-Democratic movement. Bukharin opposed the right of nations to
self-determination and the mini mum-programme demands in general,
contending that they were “contrary” to socialist revolution. However,no
one supported Bukharin at the conference.





[13]

Reference is to Bukharin’s theses “On the Self-Determination Slogan”,
written in November 1915 and submitted to the editors of
Sotsial-Demokrat over the signatures of Bukharin, Pyatakov and
Bosh.





[14]

This refers to the “Programm-Entwurf der R.S.V. und der
S.D.A.P. Hollands” (“Draft Programme of the Revolutionary-Socialist
League and the Social-Democratic Labour Party of Holland”) compiled by
Henriette Roland-Holst and published on February 29, 1916 in No. 3 of the
Bulletin of the international Socialist Committee over the
signatures of Henriette Roland-Holst, J. Visscher, D. Wijnkoop and
J. Ceton.  

The International Socialist Committee—the executive body of
the Zimmerwald group elected at time first International Socialist
Conference in Zimmerwald, September 5–8, 1915, and composed of Robert
Grimm, Oddino Morgan, Charles Name and A. Balabanova. Its headquarters were
in Berne. Shortly after the Zimmerwald Conference, on Grimm’s suggestion, a
larger International Socialist Committee was formed, composed of
representatives of all the parties subscribing to the Zimmerwald
decisions. The R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee was represented on it by Lenin,
Inessa Armand and Zinoviev. It published the Internationale
Sozialistische
   

Kommission zu Bern. Bulletin (Bulletin of the international
Socialist Committee in Berne) in German, French and English language
editions. Six issues appeared between September 1915 and January 1917.





[15]

Vorbote (The Herald)—theoretical organ of the Zimmerwald Left,
published in German in Borne. Two issues appeared, in January and April
1916. The official publishers were Roland-Holst and Pannekoek.  

Lenin had an active share in founding the magazine and, after the
appearance of its first issue, in organising a French edition to reach a
wider readership. A keen discussion was conducted on its pages by Left
Zimmerwaldists on the right of nations to self-determination and the
“disarmament” slogan.





[16]

Sotsial-Demokrat—illegal Central Organ of the
R.S.D.L.P. published from February 1908 to January 1917. After unsuccessful
at tempts to issue the first number of the paper in Russia, publication was
arranged abroad. Nos. 2–32 (February 1909–December 1913) were put out in
Paris and Nos. 33–58 (November 1914–January 1917) in Geneva. Altogether,
58 issues appeared, five of which had supplements. From December 1911,
Sotsial-Demokrat was edited by Lenin and carried more than 80 of
his articles and shorter items.  

Lenin directed all the affairs of the paper, decided on the con tents
of the current issue, edited the various contributions and looked after the
production side.  

During the First World War, Sotsial-Demokrat played an
outstanding part in combating international opportunism, nationalism and
chauvinism, in popularising the Bolshevik slogans and in awakening the
working class and the working people generally for struggle against the
imperialist war and its instigators, against the tsarist autocracy and
capitalism. Sotsial-Demokrat also played a major part in uniting
the internationalist forces in the Social-Democratic movement.





[17]

The Zimmerwald Left was formed on Lenin’s initiative at the
International Socialist Conference in Zimmerwald in September 1915. The
group consisted of eight of the Conference delegates, representing the
R.S.D.L.P. Central Committee, Left Social-Democrats in Sweden, Norway,
Switzerland and Germany, the Polish Social-Democratic opposition and the
Latvian Social-Democrats. Led by Lenin, it combated the Centrist conference
majority. Its draft resolutions and draft Manifesto condemning the war,
exposing the treachery of the social-chauvinists and emphasising the need
for active struggle against the war were rejected by the Centrist
majority. However, the Zimmerwald Left did succeed in including in the
adopted Manifesto a number of important points from its draft
resolution. Regarding the Manifesto as a first step in the struggle against
the imperialist war, the Zimmerwald Left voted for-it, but in a special
statement pointed out its inadequacy and inconsistency. At the same time,
the group stated that while it would remain part

   

of the Zimmerwald movement, it would continue to disseminate its views and
conduct independent work internationally. It elected a Bureau, which
included Lenin, Zinoviev and Radek, and published its own organ,
Vorbote (see Note No. 8).  

The Bolsheviks, the only ones to take a correct and consistently
internationalist position, were the leading force in the Zimmerwald
Left. Lenin corn bated Radek’s opportunist vacillations and criticised the
mistakes of other members of the group.  

The Zimmerwald Left became the rallying point for internationalist
elements in the world Social-Democratic movement (see also Note No. 36).





[18]

This meeting, held in Berne, February 5–9, 1916, was attended by
22 representatives of internationalist socialists in Germany, Russia,
Italy, Norway, Austria, Poland, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Rumania and several
more countries. The composition of the meeting was indicative of the
changed alignment of forces in favour of the Left, though most of the
delegates, as at the original Zimmerwald Conference, were Centrists.  

The meeting adopted an appeal to all affiliated parties and groups
(Rundschreiben an alle angeschlossen Parteien und Gruppen), in which were
included, as a result of pressure from the Bolsheviks and other Left
forces, amendments in line with the Zimmerwald Left policy. The appeal
condemned socialist participation in bourgeois governments, denounced the
slogan of “fatherland defence” in an imperialist war and approval of war
credits. It stressed the need to support the labour movement and prepare
for mass revolutionary actions against the imperialist war. However, the
appeal was inconsistent, since it did not call for a break with
social-chauvinism and opportunism. Not all of Lenin’s amendments were
adopted. The Zimmerwald Lefts declared that though they did not consider
the appeal satisfactory in all its points, they would vote for it as a step
forward compared with the decisions of the first Zimmerwald Conference.





[19]

Rabochaya Mysl (Workers’ Thought)—a newspaper published by a
group of Economists in Russia from October 1897 to December 1902. A
critique of the paper as representative of the Russian variety of
international opportunism will be found in Lenin’s What Is To Be
Done?




[20]

Prosveshcheniye (Enlightenment)—a monthly theoretical, legal
Bolshevik magazine, published in St. Petersburg from December 1911 to June
1914. Its circulation reached 5,000 copies. While in Paris, and later in
Cracow and Poronin, Lenin directed the magazine, edited articles published
in it and regularly corresponded with the members of the editorial
hoard. Among his own articles published in Prosveshcheniye are the
following: “Fundamental Problems of the Election Campaign”, “The Three
Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism”, “Critical Remarks on the
National Question”, “The Right of Nations to Self-Determination”,
“Disruption

   

of Unity Concealed by Shouts for Unity” and “The Methods of Struggle of
the Bourgeois Intellectuals Against the Workers”.





[21]

Lenin is here referring to the programme of the French Workers’ Party
adopted in 1580, and to the programmes of the German Social-Democratic
Party adopted in Gotha in 1875 and in Erfurt in 1891.





[22]

Reference is to the pamphlet Socialism and War (see present
edition, Vol. 21, pp. 295–338).





[23]

Reference is to the Declaration of the Polish Social-Democrats at the
1915 Zimmerwald Conference. The Declaration protested against the
oppressive policy of the tsarist and German and Austrian governments which
“deprive the Polish people of the opportunity to shape their own
destiny,regard the Polish lands as a pawn in future bargaining over
compensation....” “And this,” the Declaration said, “brings out with
especial crudity the very essence of the policy of the capitalist
governments which, in sending the masses to the slaughter, are at the same
time arbitrarily shaping the destinies of nations for generations to
come.” The Polish Social-Democrats, the Declaration said, are convinced
that only participation in the impending struggle of the international
revolutionary proletariat for socialism—“in the struggle that will tear
the fetters of national oppression and destroy alien domination in whatever
form or shape—will assure the Polish people, too, the opportunity for
all-round development as an equal member of the alliance of the nations”.

The “Military Programme of the Proletarian Revolution” (in a letter
    Lenin refers to it as an article “On Disarmament”) was written in German
    and meant for publication in the Swiss, Swedish and Norwegian Left
    Social-Democratic press. However, it was not published at the time. Lenin
    somewhat re-edited it for publication in Russian. The article “The
    ‘Disarmament’ Slogan” appeared in Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata
    No. 2, Decmeber 1916 (see pp. 94–104 of this volume).  

    The original, German text appeared in Jugend-Internationale,
    organ of the International League of Socialist Youth Organisations, Nos.9
    and 10, September and October 1917, under the heading “Das
    Militärprogramm der proletarischen Revolution”. The article was
    reprinted with this editorial forward: “In our day, when Lenin is one of
    the most spoken-of leaders of the Russian revolution, the following article
    by this veteran revolutionary stalwart, in which he sets out a large part
    of his political programm, is of especial interest. We received it shortly
    before his departure from Zurich in April 1917.” The heading was
    apparently given by the editors of Jugend-Internationale.


Jugend-Internationale (The Youth International)—Organ of the

Notes
 
 



   Lenin’s
      book The Development of Capitalism in Russia was the
      result of tremendous research lasting more than three
      years. Lenin began intensive work on his book when in prison,
      soon after his arrest in connection with the case of the
      St. Petersburg “League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the
      Working Class,” and finished it in the village of Shushenskoye
      where he lived in exile. He had, however, been gathering
      material for his book long before he began writing it.

    
      In his first letter from prison, dated January 2, 1896, Lenin
      wrote: “I have a plan that has occupied my mind considerably
      ever since I was arrested, increasingly so as time passes. I
      have long been engaged on an economic problem (that of the
      marketing of the products of manufacturing industry within the
      country), have selected some literature, drawn up a plan for its
      analysis and have even done some writing with a view to having
      my work published in book form, should its dimensions exceed
      those of a magazine article. I should be very unwilling to give
      up on the job, and am now, apparently, faced with the
      alternative of either writing it here or of abandoning it
      altogether.” (See present edition, Vol. 37)

    
      In the same letter, in addition to giving instructions about
      books to be obtained according to a list he had drawn up, Lenin
      unfolded his plan of work:

    
      “The list of books,” he wrote, “is divided into the two parts
      into which my book is divided. A–The general theoretical
      part. This requires fewer books, so that, in any case, I hope to
      write it. although it needs more preparatory work. B–The
      application of the theoretical principles to Russian facts. This
      part requires very many books. The chief difficulty will be: 1)
      Zemstvo publications. Part of them, by the way, I already have,
      but another part (small monographs) may be ordered, and a part
      may be obtained through statisticians I know; 2) Government
      publications–the papers of commissions, reports and minutes of
      congresses, etc. These are important, but they are more
      difficult to obtain. Some of them, even the majority, I think,
      are in the library of the Free Economic Society. (See present
      edition, Vol. 37)
    


      Lenin’s sister, A. I. Ulyanova-Elizarova, relates in her
      reminiscences that while Vladimir Ilyich was working on his book
      in prison “he decided to use the St. Petersburg libraries in
      order to obtain material needed for the work he had planned and
      that he knew he would not be able to get in exile. And so in
      prison he made an intense study of a mass of source material,
      and copied out numerous extracts. I dragged heaps of books to
      him from the Free Economic Society library, from the Academy of
      Sciences and from other scientific book reposititories.”

    
      Lenin also worked on the book while on his way to exile.
      In a letter dated March 15, 1897, he wrote that while on the way
      he had looked over some “books borrowed for a short while,” and
      that he intended to send them back from Krasnoyarsk. During a
      halt at Krasnoyarsk (en route for Shushenskoye village), Lenin
      made a study of books and magazines that he found in the rich
      private library of G. V. Yudin, a merchant, and also in the
      local city library.

    
      While in exile Lenin continued to work hard on The
      Development of Capitalism in Russia. Since he did not
      possess the means to buy large numbers of books, he wrote to his
      relatives asking them to make arrangements to supply him from
      libraries in the capital. “... It would very likely be more
      profitable for me to spend money on postage and have many books
      than to spend much more money on buying a few books.”
      (See present edition, Vol. 37). On Lenin’s instructions, his
      sister, M. I. Ulyanova, copied out numerous extracts from
      various books in the Rumyantsev Library in Moscow. Lenin received
      these extracts at the end of May 1897. From the autumn of the
      same year, he received the material he needed regularly and set
      to work on the new sources, particularly on the numerous
      statistical abstracts. In the spring of 1898, N. K. Krupskaya,
      who had secured a transfer from her place of exile in Ufa to
      Shushenskoye, brought Lenin many books.

    
      During his three years’ work on The Development of
      Capitalism in Russia, Lenin studied and made a critical
      analysis of everything that had been written on Russian
      economics. In this monograph mention is made of, and passages
      are quoted from, over 500 different books, abstracts, research
      papers, reviews and articles. The literature, however, actually
      studied and used by Lenin, but not included among the sources
      mentioned, was much more extensive. But even this list
      gives an idea of the colossal amount of work involved in his
      study of the development of Russian capitalism.

    
      The draft of The Development of Capitalism in Russia
      was completed in August 1898. In a letter dated October 11,
      1898, Lenin wrote: “I have finished drafting my markets, and I
      have begun to give them the finishing touches. The making of a
      fair copy will go on simultaneously, so that I have thought of
      sending it off in parts and of having it printed as it gets
      there in order to avoid delay (I expect to send off the first
      lot in a month’s time at the very latest); if they begin
      printing it in December, it might



just be in time for this
      season.” (See present edition, Vol. 37). Much time was needed to
      give the manuscript the finishing touches and the job was
      completed at the end of January 1899.

    
      Lenin paid careful attention to the remarks of comrades and
      relatives who read The Development of Capitalism in
      Russia while it was still in manuscript. Each chapter was
      copied into a separate little notebook, and, apart from
      Krupskaya, was read and discussed by other Social-Democrats who
      were in exile at that time in the Minusinsk area. “We were the
      ‘first readers,’ so to speak, of The Development of
      Capitalism in Russia,” wrote G. M. Krzhizhanovsky in his
      reminiscences (he lived in exile not far from Shushenskoye
      village). “Whatever was sent to us, we read carefully and
      returned it to Lenin with our comments. He took our comments
      very much into consideration.”

    
The Development of Capitalism in Russia came off the
      press at the end of March, 1899, under the pseudonym of
      “Vladimir Ilyin.” The issue of 2,400 copies was sold out very
      quickly and circulated mainly among the Social-Democratic
      intelligentsia, the student youth, and also through the medium
      of propagandists in workers’ study circles.

    
      The bourgeois press tried to pass over Lenin’s monograph in
      silence, and the first reviews did not appear until the autumn
      of 1899. One of them received a crushing retort from Lenin in
      his article “Uncritical Criticism,” which was printed in the
      magazine Nauchnoye Obozreniye (Scientific Review) for
      May-June 1900 (see pp. 609-32 in this volume).

    
      A second edition of The Development of Capitalism in
      Russia appeared in 1908.

    
      Since the establishment of Soviet power The Development of
      Capitalism in Russia has, according to data as of October
      1, 1957, been published 75 times, in a total of 3,372,000 copies
      and in 20 of the languages of the Soviet peoples. In addition it
      has appeared in the English, French, German, Spanish, Chinese,
      Czech, Hungarian, Japanese, Turkish and other foreign languages.

    
      Part of the preparatory work for The Development of
      Capitalism in Russia, which shows the volume of the
      research done by Lenin, and the methods he employed, has been
      published in the Lenin Miscellany XXXIII.

    
      The present volume follows the second, 1908, edition, which was
      published after the text had been corrected and supplemented by
      Lenin. In addition, account has been taken of all the author’s
      remarks concerning the first, 1899, edition.
