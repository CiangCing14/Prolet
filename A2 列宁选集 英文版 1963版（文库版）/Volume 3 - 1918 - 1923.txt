      (Applause, which grows into ovation.) Comrades, this is
      not the first time we have pointed out in the Party press, in
      Soviet institutions and in our agitation among the people that
      the period up to the new harvest will be the most difficult,
      arduous and crucial phase in the socialist revolution that has
      begun in Russia. Now, I think, we must say that this crucial
      situation has reached its climax. That is because it has now
      become perfectly clear once and for all who are the supporters
      of the imperialist world, of the imperialist countries, and who
      are the supporters of the Soviet Socialist Republic. It should
      first be said that from the military standpoint the position of
      the Soviet Republic has only now become quite clear. Many at
      first regarded the Czechoslovak revolt[2]

      as just one of the episodes in the chain of counterrevolutionary
      revolts. We did not sufficiently appreciate the news in the
      papers about the participation in this revolt of British and
      French capital, of the British and French imperialists. We must
      now recall how events developed in Murmansk, among the Siberian
      troops and in the Kuban, how the British and French, in alliance
      with the Czechs, with the closest co-operation of the British
      bourgeoisie, endeavoured to overthrow the Soviets. All these
      facts now show that the Czechoslovak movement was one link in
      the chain long since forged by the systematic policy of the
      British and French imperialists to throttle Soviet Russia so as
      to again drag Russia into the ring of imperialist wars. This
      crisis must now be resolved by the broad mass of the people of
      Soviet Russia, for we are today laced not only with a struggle
      to preserve the Soviet Socialist Republic from the Czech attack,
      as one particular counter-revolutionary assault, and not even
      from counterrevolutionary assaults in general, but with a
      struggle against the onslaught of the whole imperialist world.

    

      I should like first of all to remind you of the fact that the
      direct participation of the British and French imperialists in
      the Czechoslovak revolt has long been established; I would
      remind you of an article printed by Prukopnik Svobody, the
      central organ of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, on June 28
      and reprinted in our press[3]:

    

      “ On March 7, the Department of the National Council
      received the first instalment from the French Consul to the
      amount of three million rubies.

    

      This money was handed to a certain Mr. Sip, an official of the Department of the National Council.

    

      On March 9, this same Sip received another two million and on
      March 25 another million, and on March 26,
      Mr. Bohumil-Cermák, Vice-President of the National Council,
      received one million; on April 3, Mr. Sip received another
      million.

    

      In all, from March 7 to April 4, the French Consul paid the
      Department of the National Council 8 million rubles.

    

      No dates are indicated for the following payments: Mr. Sip one
      million, Mr. Bohumil-Cermák one million and Mr. Sip another
      million.

    

      In addition, a sum of 188,000 rubles was paid to an unknown
      person. Total: 3,188,000 rubles. Together with the
      above-mentioned 8 million we get a total of 11,188,000 rubles
      paid by the French Government to the Department of the National
      Council.

    

      From the British Consul the Department received
      £,80,000. Thus, from March 7 to the date of action, the
      leaders of the Czech National Council received about 15 million
      rubles from the French and British governments, and for this sum
      the Czechoslovak army was sold to the French and British
      imperialists.” 

    

      The majority of you, of course, read this report in the
      newspapers at the time it was published. We certainly never
      doubted that the imperialists and financial magnates of Britain
      and France would do their very utmost to overthrow the Soviet
      government and place every possible obstacle in its way. But at
      that time the picture was not yet complete to show that what we
      are faced with here is a systematic, methodical and evidently
      long-planned counter-revolutionary military and financial
      campaign against the Soviet Republic, which all the
      representatives of British and French imperialism had evidently
      been preparing for months The general trend of events becomes
      clear now when we review them as a whole, when we compare the
      Czechoslovak counter-revolutionary movement with the Murmansk
      landing-where we know the British have disembarked over ten
      thousand soldiers, and under the pretext of defending Murmansk
      have actually begun to advance, have occupied Kem and Soroki,
      have moved to the east of Soroki, and have begun to shoot our
      Soviet officials-and when we read in the newspapers that many
      thousands of railwaymen and other workers of the Far North are
      fleeing from these saviours and liberators, or, to give them
      their true name, these new imperialist bandits who are rending
      Russia from another end. And quite recently we received new
      confirmation of the character of the Anglo-French offensive
      against Russia.

    

      For geographical considerations alone it is clear that the form
      of this imperialist offensive against Russia cannot be the same
      as it was in the case of Germany. There are no common frontiers
      with Russia, as in the case of Germany; troop strength is
      less. In her wars of conquest, Britain has been compelled for
      many decades, owing to the primarily colonial and naval
      character of her military might, to employ different methods of
      attack, to attempt chiefly to cut off her victim’s supply
      sources, and to prefer the method of strangulation, under
      pretext of aid, to open, direct, blunt and outright military
      force. From information recently received, it is clear that
      Alexeyev, who has long been notorious among the Russian soldiers
      and workers and who recently seized the village of
      Tikhoretskaya, has undoubtedly been utilising the aid of British
      arid French imperialism. There the revolt was more clear-cut,
      again apparently because British and French imperialism had a
      hand in it.

    

      Lastly, we received news yesterday that in Baku the British and
      French imperialists have succeeded in making a very effective
      move. They have managed to secure a majority of about thirty
      votes in the Baku Soviet, over our Party, over the Bolsheviks,
      and those Left Socialist-Revolutionaries[4]

      unfortunately, very few in number-who refused to fall in with
      the despicable gambles and treachery of the Moscow Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, and who have remained loyal to the
      Soviet government in the struggle against imperialism and
      war. Over this nucleus in the Baku Soviet which is loyal to the
      Soviet government and which up to now constituted the majority,
      the British and French imperialists have now secured a majority
      of thirty votes, owing to the fact that the greater part of the
      Dashmktsutyun Party,[5]

      the Armenian quasi-socialists, have sided with them against us. (Reads telegram.)

    

      “On July 26, on the orders of People’s Commissar
      Korganov, the Adji-Kabul detachment retired from Adji-Kabul to a
      position near Alyat. After the withdrawal of the Shomakha
      detachment from Shemakha and Maraza the enemy began to advance
      along the River Pirsagat valley; the first skirmish with the
      enemy’s vanguard occurred near the village of Kubala.

    

      Simultaneously from the south, from the direction of the Kura, a
      large force of cavalry began to advance towards Pirsagat. Under
      the circumstances, to hold Adji-Kabul we would have had to
      deploy all our available forces on three sides: to the west of
      Adji-Kabul, and to the north and south of the Navagi-Pirsagat
      valley. Such an extension of the front would have left us
      without reserves and would have made it impossible for us to
      strike at the enemy as we have no cavalry, and would even have
      endangered the group at Adji-Kabul if the front had been broken
      from the north or south. In view of this situation, and in order
      to conserve the strength of the troops, orders were given to the
      detachment to retreat from Adji-Kabul to a position near
      Alyat. The retreat was carried out in good order. Important
      railway installations and the Adji-Kabul station as well as the
      kerosene and oil tanks, have been blown up. In Daghestan, the
      enemy is on the move as part of the general offensive. On July
      24, the enemy advanced in large forces in four directions. After
      twenty-four hours’ fighting we occupied the enemy’s
      trenches; the foe dispersed into the woods and nightfall
      prevented further pursuit. Oil July 24, news of successes was
      received from Shura, where fighting is going on around the town;
      the enemy is tting up a stubborn and organised resistance, and
      is commanded by former Dagbestan officers. Daghestan peasants
      are taking an active part in the fighting around Shura.

    

      The Bight-wing parties in Baku have raised their heads and are
      vigorously campaigning to call in the British. This campaign is
      strongly backed by the army officers and is being conducted
      among the forces at the front. Anglophil agitation has
      disorganized the army. The British orientation has recently been
      making great headway among the worn-out and despairing people.

    

      Under the influence of the unscrupulous and provocative
      activities of the Right-wing parties, the Caspian flotilla has
      adopted several contradictory resolutions in regard to the
      British. Deceived by British hirelings and volunteer agents,
      until quite recently it blindly believed in the sincerity of
      British support.

    

      Latest reports say that the British are advancing in Persia and
      have occupied Resht (Giljan), where for four days they have been
      engaged against Knchuk-Khan and the German and Turkish
      bands. who have joined forces with him, headed by Mussavatists[6]

      who had fled from Baku. After the Resht battle the British
      applied to us for assistance, but our representatives in Persia
      refused. The British got the upper hand in Resht. But they have
      practically no forces in Persia. We know they have only fifty
      men in Enzeli. They need petrol, in exchange for which they are
      offering us cars. Without petrol they are stuck.

    

      On July 25, a second session of the Soviet was held to discuss
      the political and military situation, and at the insistence of
      the rightwing parties the question of the British was raised
      Comrade Shahumyan, Commissar Extraordinary for the Caucasus,
      citing the resolution of the Fifth Congress of Soviets and
      Stalin’s telegram on behalf of the Central Council of
      People’s Commissars, spoke against inviting the British
      and demanded that this question be struck from the
      agenda. Comrade Shahumyan’s move was defeated by a small
      majority, whereupon, as representative of the central
      government, he entered a vigorous protest. The session heard the
      report of the delegates who had visited the front. By 259 votes
      of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, Right Dashnaks and
      Mensheviks against 236 votes of the Bolsheviks Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Left Dashnaks, a resolution was
      adopted to invite the British and form a government comprising
      members of all parties represented in the Soviet and recognising
      the Power of the Council of People’s Commissars. The
      resolution was sharpy condemned by the Left wing. Shahumyan
      declared that he regarded it as a shameful betrayal and stark
      ingratitude towards the workers and peasants of Russia and that
      as the central government’s representative, he renounced
      all responsibility for the decision. A statement was made on
      behalf of the group of the Bolsheviks, Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Left Dashnaks to the effect that
      they would not join the coalition government and that the
      Council of People’s Commissars would resign. Comrade
      Shahumyan declared in the name of the three Left groups that a
      government which had in fact broken with the Russian Soviet
      government by inviting the British imperialists would receive no
      support from Soviet Russia. By its treacherous policy of
      inviting the British, the local Soviet had lost Russia and the
      parties supporting the Soviet government.

    

      The Right-wing parties were thrown into utter confusion at the
      decision of the Council of People’s Commissars to
      resign. When news of this situation got around there was an
      abrupt change of sentiment in the districts and at the
      front. The sailors realised they had been duped by traitors who
      want to break with Russia and bring down the Soviet
      government. The people are having second thoughts about the
      British. Yesterday, an urgent meeting of the Executive Committee
      was held over the resignation of the Council of People’s
      Commissars. It was decided that all the People’s
      Commissars should remain at their posts and continue their
      former functions pending decision of the question of power at
      the Soviet’s session on July 31. The Executive Committee
      has decided to take urgent t measures to combat the threatening
      counter-revolution. The foe is carrying on activities under the
      wing or the A nglo-French parties.

    

      Press Bureau of the Baku Council of People’s
      Commissars,” 

    

      Not unlike the groups here. who call themselves socialists but
      have never broken off relations with the bourgeoisie there,
      too. these people came out in favour of inviting the British
      troops to defend Baku.[7]

      We already know only too well the meaning of such an invitation
      to imperialist troops to defend the Soviet Republic. We know the
      meaning of this invitation extended by the bourgeoisie a section
      of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and by the Mensheviks. We know
      the meaning of this invitation extended by the Menshevik leaders
      in Tiflis, Georgia.

    

      We may now say that the Bolshevik, the Communist Party is the
      only party which has never invited imperialists and has never
      entered into a rapacious alliance with them but has only
      retreated before these cutthroats when they pressed too
      hard. (Applause.) We know our Communist comrades in the
      Caucasus were in a very difficult position because the
      Mensheviks betrayed them everywhere by entering into direct
      alliance with the German imperialists, on the pretext, of course
      of defending Georgia’s independence.

    

      You are all aware that this independence of Georgia has become a
      sheer fraud. In actual fact it amounts to the occupation and
      complete seizure of Georgia by the German imperialists, an
      alliance of German bayonets with the Menshevik government
      against the Bolshevik workers and peasants. And, therefore., our
      Baku comrades were a thousand times right in refusing to close
      their eyes to the danger of the situation and saying: W(,. would
      never be opposed to peace with an imperialist power on the basis
      of ceding part of our territory, provided this would not harm
      us, would not bind our troops in an alliance with the bayonets
      of the aggressors and would not prevent us from carrying on our
      Socialist reconstruction.

    

      But since, as the question now stands, by inviting the British,
      supposedly for the defence of Baku, they are inviting a power
      which has now swallowed up the whole of Persia and which has
      long been moving up its forces for seizing the Southern
      Caucasus—that is, surrendering themselves to British and
      French imperialism—we cannot doubt or hesitate for a
      moment any must say that, however difficult the position of our
      Baku comrades may be, by refusing to conclude such a peace they
      have taken the only step worthy of true socialists. This
      resolute rejection of any agreement whatsoever with the British
      and French imperialists was the only true course for our Baku
      comrades to take, for you cannot invite them without converting
      your independent socialist government, even though on severed
      territory, into a slave of imperialist war.

    

      We therefore do riot entertain the slightest doubt as to the
      significance of the Baku events in the general scheme of
      things. Yesterday, news was received that counter-revolutionary
      revolts have broken out in a number of towns in Central Asia
      with the obvious complicity of the British entrenched in India,
      who, having brought Afghanistan completely under their sway,
      long ago created a base for extending their colonial
      possessions, strangling nations, and attacking Soviet
      Russia. And now, when these separate links have become quite
      clear to us, the present military and general strategic position
      of our Republic has been fully revealed. Murmansk in the North,
      the Czechoslovak front in the East, Turkestan. Baku and
      Astrakhan in the South-East—we see that practically all
      the links in the chain forged by British and French imperialism
      have been joined.

    

      We now clearly see that the landowners, the capitalists and the
      kulaks, all of whom, of course. for perfectly natural reasons
      have a burning hatred for the Soviet government are acting here,
      toe, in ways greatly resembling those of the landowners,
      capitalists and kulaks in the Ukraine and in other regions
      severed from Russia. As the lackeys of British and French
      imperialism they have done their utmost to undermine the Soviet
      government at all costs. Realising they could not do it with
      forces inside Russia alone, they decided to act not by words or
      appeals in the spirit o the Martov gentry, but by restoring to
      more effective methods of struggle—military
      hostilities. That is where our attention should he chiefly
      directed: that is Where we should concentrate all our agitation
      arid propaganda; and we should shift the centre of the whole of
      our Soviet work accordingly.

    

      The fundamental fact is that it is the imperialist forces of the
      other coalition that are now at work, not the German, but the
      Anglo-French, which have seized part of our territory and are
      using it as a base. Up to now their geographical position has
      prevented them from attacking Russia by the direct route; now
      British and French imperialism, which for four years has been
      drenching the whole world in blood in a bid for world supremacy,
      has by an indirect route approached within easy reach of Russia,
      with the object of strangling the Soviet Republic and once more
      plunging Russia into imperialist war. You are all perfectly
      aware, comrades, that from the very beginning of the October
      Revolution our chief aim has been to put a stop to the
      imperialist war; but we never harboured the illusion that the
      forces of the proletariat and the revolutionary people of any
      one country, however heroic and however organised and
      disciplined they might be, could overthrew international
      imperialism. That can be done only by the joint efforts of the
      workers of the world.

    

      What we have done, however, is to sever all connections with the
      capitalists of the whole world in one country. Our government is
      net tied by a single thread to any kind of imperialist and never
      will be, whatever future course our revolution may take. The
      revolutionary movement against imperialism during the eight
      months of our rule has made tremendous strides, and in one of
      the chief centres of imperialism, Germany, matters in January
      1918 came to an armed clash and the bloody suppression of that
      movement. We have done our revolutionary duty as no
      revolutionary government in any country has ever done on an
      international world-wide scale. But we never deceived ourselves
      into thinking this could be done by the efforts of one country
      alone. We knew that our efforts were inevitably leading to a
      world-wide revolution, and that the war begun by the imperialist
      governments could not be stepped by the efforts of those
      governments themselves. It can be stopped only by the efforts of
      all workers; and when we came to power, our task as the
      proletarian Communist Party, at a time when capitalist bourgeois
      rule still remained in the ether countries-our immediate task, I
      repeat, was to retain that power, that torch of socialism, so
      that it might scatter as many sparks as possible to add to the
      growing flames of socialist revolution.

    

      This was everywhere an extremely difficult task; and what
      enabled us to accomplish it was the fact that the proletariat
      rallied to the defence of the gains of the Socialist
      Republic. This task has led to a particularly arduous and
      critical situation, for the socialist revolution, in the direct
      sense of the term, has not yet begun in any country, although it
      is more imminent in countries like Italy and Austria. But as it
      has net yet begun, we are faced with a new success to British
      and French, and therefore world, imperialism. Whereas from the
      West, German imperialism continues to stand as a military,
      annexatory, imperialist force, from the North-East and South of
      Russia, British and French imperialism has been able to dig
      itself in and is making it patently obvious to us that this
      force is prepared once more to plunge Russia into imperialist
      war, is prepared to crush Russia, the independent socialist
      state that is continuing its socialist work and propaganda on a
      scale hitherto unparalleled anywhere in the world. Against this,
      British and French imperialism has won a big victory, and,
      surrounding us on all sides, it is doing its utmost to crush
      Soviet Russia. We are fully aware that British and French
      imperialism’s victory is inseparably connected with the
      class struggle.

    

      We have always said, and revolutions bear it outthat when the
      foundations of the exploiters’ economic power are at
      stake, their property, which places the labour of tens of
      millions of workers and peasants at their disposal and enables
      the landowners and capitalists to enrich themselves, when, I
      repeat the private property of the capitalists and landowners is
      at stake, they forget all talk about love for one’s
      country and independence. We know full well that the Cadets, the
      Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks have beaten
      the record in concluding alliances with the imperialist powers,
      in concluding predatory treaties and betraying the country to
      Anglo-French imperialism. The Ukraine and Tiflis are good
      examples The alliance of the Mensheviks and Right
      Socialist-Revolutionaries with the Czechs is sufficient proof of
      this. And the action of the Left Socialist-R revolutionaries,
      when they tried to embroil the Russian Republic in war in the
      interests of the Yaroslavl white guards,[8]

      shows quite clearly that when their class profits are at stake,
      the bourgeoisie will sell their country and strike a bargain
      with any foreigner against their own people. This truth has time
      and again been borne out by the history of the Russian
      revolution, after the history of revolution over a hundred years
      had shown that that is the law of the class interests, of the
      class policy of the bourgeoisie at all times and in all
      countries. It is therefore by no means surprising that the
      present aggravation of the Soviet Republic’s international
      position is connected with the aggravation of the class struggle
      at home.

    

      We have often said that, in this respect, in regard to the
      aggravation of the food crisis, the period until the new harvest
      will be the most difficult. Russia is being flayed with the
      scourge of famine, which has attained unparalleled proportions
      precisely because it is the plan of the imperialist robbers to
      cut off her granaries. Their calculations are well founded and
      are aimed at getting social and class support in the
      grain-producing outlying regions; they seek areas where the
      kulaks predominate—the rich peasants, who have battened on
      the war and who live by the labour of others, the labour of the
      poor. You know that these people have piled up hundreds of
      thousands of rubles and that they have huge stocks of grain. You
      know that it is these people who have battened on national
      misfortunes and who had greater opportunity to rob and increase
      their profits the more the population of the capital
      suffered—it is these kulaks who have constituted the chief
      and most formidable buttress of the counter-revolutionary
      movement in Russia. Here the class struggle has reached its
      deepest source. There is not a village left where the class
      struggle is not. raging between a miserable handful of kulaks on
      the one hand and the vast labouring majority-the poor and those
      middle peasants who have no grain surpluses, who have consumed
      them long ago, and who did not go in for profiteering—on
      the other. This class struggle has penetrated every village.

    

      When we were determining our political plans and publishing our
      decrees-the vast majority of those present here are, of course,
      familiar with them—when, I repeat, we drafted and passed
      the decrees on the organisation of the poor peasants,[9]

      it was clear to us we were coming up against the most decisive
      and fundamental issue of the whole revolution, the most decisive
      and fundamental issue, the issue of power-whether power would
      remain in the hands of the workers; whether they could gain the
      support of all the poor peasants, with whom they have no
      differences; whether they would succeed in winning over the
      peasants with whom they have no disagreement, and unite this
      whole mass, which is dispersed, disunited and scattered through
      the villages-in which respect it lags behind the urban workers;
      whether they could unite them against the other camp, the camp
      of the landowners, the imperialists and kulaks.

    

      Before our very eyes the poor peasants have begun to rally
      together very quickly. It is said that revolution teaches. The
      class struggle does indeed teach in practice that any false note
      in the position of any party immediately lands that party where,
      it deserves to be. We have clearly seen the policy of the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party, who, because of their
      spinelessness and stupidity, started to vacillate at a time when
      the food problem was at its height, and that party disappeared
      from the scene as a party and became a pawn in the hands of the
      Yaroslavl white guards. (Applause.)

    

      Comrades, the wave of revolts sweeping Russia is easy to
      understand in the light of this sharpening of the class struggle
      over the food crisis at the very time when we know the new
      harvest is a bumper one but cannot yet be gathered, and when the
      hunger-tormented people of Petrograd and Moscow are being driven
      to revolt by the kulaks and the bourgeoisie, who are making the
      most desperate efforts, crying “Now or never!” There
      is the revolt in Yaroslavl. And we can see the influence of the
      British and French; we see the calculations of the
      counterrevolutionary landowners and bourgeoisie. Wherever the
      question of grain arose, they obstructed the grain monopoly,
      without which there can be. no socialism. That. is just where
      the bourgeoisie are bound to unite; here the bourgeoisie have a
      stronger backing than the country yokel. The decisive fight
      between the forces of socialism and bourgeois society is bound
      to come in any case, whatever happens, if not today, then
      tomorrow, on one issue or another. Only pseudo-socialists, like
      our Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, for example, can waver. When
      socialists waver over this question, over this fundamental
      question, it means they are only pseudo-socialists, and are not
      worth a brass farthing. The effect of the revolution has
      virtually been to turn such socialists into more pawns in the
      hands of the French generals, pawns whose role was demonstrated
      by the former Central Committee of the former Left
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party.

    

      Comrades, the result of these combined efforts of the
      counter-revolutionary Russian bourgeoisie and the British and
      French imperialists has been that the Civil War-in our country
      is now coming from a quarter which not all of us anticipated and
      from which not all of us clearly realised it might come, and it
      has merged with the war from without into one indivisible
      whole. The kulak revolt, the Czechoslovak mutiny and the
      Murmansk movement are all part of one and the same war that is
      bearing down on Russia. We escaped from war in one quarter by
      incurring tremendous losses and signing an incredibly harsh
      peace treaty; we knew we were concluding a predatory peace,[10]

      but we said we would be able to continue our propaganda and our
      constructive work, and in that way cause the imperialist
      world’s disintegration. We have succeeded in doing
      so. Germany is now negotiating with us as to how many thousand
      millions to extort from Russia on the basis of the Brest-Litovsk
      Peace Treaty, but she has recognised all the acts of
      nationalisation we proclaimed under the decree of June 28.[11]

      She has not raised the question of private ownership of land in
      the Republic; this point must be stressed as a counterblast to
      the fantastic lies spread by Spiridonova and similar leaders of
      the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, lies that have brought grist
      to the mill of the landowners and are now being repeated by the
      most ignorant and backward Black-Hundred[12]

      elements. These lies must be nailed.

    

      The fact of the matter is that, burdensome as the peace treaty
      may be, we have won freedom to carry on socialist construction
      at home, and have taken steps in this direction which are now
      becoming known in Western Europe and constitute elements of
      propaganda that are incomparably more effective than any before.

    

      So, having got out of war in one quarter, with one coalition, we
      have been at once subjected to an imperialist assault from
      another quarter. Imperialism is a world-wide phenomenon; it is a
      struggle for the division of the whole world, of the whole
      earth, for the domination of one or another group of
      robbers. Now another group of vultures, the Anglo-French, are
      hurling themselves at our throats and threatening to drag us
      into war again. Their war is merging with the Civil War into one
      continuous whole, and that is the chief source of our
      difficulties at present, when the question of war, of military
      hostilities, has again come to the fore as the cardinal and
      fundamental question of the revolution. There lies the whole
      difficulty, for the people are tired of war, exhausted by it as
      never before. The Russian people’s state of extreme war
      fatigue and exhaustion is rather like that of a man who has been
      thrashed within an inch of his life, and who cannot be expected
      to show any energy or working capacity. And in the same way this
      nearly four years’ war, overwhelming a country which had
      been despoiled, tormented, and defiled by tsarism, by the
      autocracy, the bourgeoisie and Kerensky, has for many reasons
      naturally aroused a feeling of abhorrence in the Russian people,
      and is one of the chief sources of the tremendous difficulties
      we are now experiencing.

    

      Yet such a turn of events definitely made for war. We have again
      been plunged into war, we are in a state of war; and it is not
      only civil war, war against the kulaks, the landowners and the
      capitalists who have united against us-now we are faced with
      British and French imperialism. The imperialists are still not
      in a position to throw their armies against Russia-they are
      prevented by geographical conditions; but they are devoting all
      they can, all their millions, all their diplomatic connections
      and forces, to aid our enemies. We are in a state of war, and we
      can emerge triumphant. But here we come up against a formidable
      enemy, one of the most difficult to cope with war-weariness,
      hatred and abhorrence of war; and this must be overcome,
      otherwise we shall not be able to tackle this problem-the
      problem of war-which does not depend on our will. Our country
      has again been plunged into war, and the outcome of the
      revolution will now entirely depend on who is the victor. The
      principal protagonists are the Czechs, but the real directors,
      the real motive and actuating power are the British and French
      imperialists. The whole question of the existence of the Russian
      Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, the whole question of the
      Russian socialist revolution has been reduced to a question of
      war. There lie tremendous difficulties, considering the state in
      which the people have emerged from the imperialist war. Our task
      is now perfectly clear. Any deceit would be tremendously
      harmful; we consider it a crime to conceal this bitter truth
      from the workers arid peasants. On the contrary, let the truth
      be brought home to them all as clearly and graphically as
      possible.

    

      Yes, there have been cases when our troops displayed criminal
      weakness, as, for example, during the capture of Simbirsk by the
      Czechs, when our forces retreated. We know the troops are tired
      of war and loathe it; but it is also natural and inevitable that
      until imperialism is defeated internationally, it should attempt
      to drag Russia into imperialist war, endeavour to make a
      shambles of her. Whether we like it or not, the question stands
      as follows: we are in a war, and on the outcome of that war
      hangs the fate of the revolution. That should be the first and
      last word in our propaganda work, in all our political,
      revolutionary, and construction activities. We have done very
      much in a short time, but the job is not yet over. All our
      activities must he entirely and completely geared to this
      question, on which the fate and outcome of the revolution, the
      fate of the Russian and world revolution now depends. Of course,
      world imperialism cannot get out of the present war without a
      number of revolutions; this war cannot end otherwise than by the
      ultimate victory of socialism. But our task now is to maintain,
      protect and uphold this force of socialism, this torch of
      socialism, this source of socialism which is so actively
      influencing the whole world. And as matters now stand, this task
      is a military task.

    

      This is not the first time we have been in such a situation, and
      many of us have said that however severe the price we had to pay
      for peace, however grave the sacrifices it demanded of us,
      however much the enemy was striving to rob us of more and more
      territory, Russia so far, in the face of great odds, was
      enjoying peace and in a position to consolidate her socialist
      gains. We have even gone farther in this direction than many of
      us expected. For example, our workers’ control has
      advanced a long way from its early forms, and today we are about
      to witness the conversion of the state administration into a
      socialist system. We have made great strides in our practical
      affairs. We now have the workers completely running
      industry. But circumstances have prevented us from continuing
      that work in peace; they have once again plunged us into war,
      and we must strain every nerve and summon everyone to arms. It
      would be a disgrace for any Communist to be in two minds over
      this.

    

      Vacillation among the peasants does not surprise us. The
      peasants have not been through the same school of life as the
      workers, who have been accustomed for decades to look upon the
      capitalist as their class enemy, and who have learned to unite
      their forces to combat him. We know the peasants have riot been
      through such a university. At one time they sided with the
      workers but today we are witnessing a period of vacillation,
      when the peasants are splitting up. We know any number of
      instances of kulaks selling grain to the peasants below the
      fixed prices in order to create the impression that they, the
      kulaks, are defending the peasants’ interests. None of
      this surprises us. But the Communist worker will not waver, the
      working class will stand firm; and if a kulak spirit prevails
      among the peasants, it is quite understandable. Where the Czechs
      rule and the Bolsheviks no longer are, we have the following
      picture: at first the Czechs are hailed practically as
      deliverers; but after a few weeks of this bourgeois rule, a
      tremendous movement against the Czechs and in favour of the
      Soviet government arises, because the peasants begin to realise
      that all talk about freedom of trade and a Constituent Assembly
      means only one thing-the rule of the landowners and capitalists.

    

      Our job is to get the workers to rally and to create an
      organisation under which within the next few weeks evertheing
      will be devoted to solving the war issue. We are now at war with
      British and French imperialism and with evertheing bourgeois and
      capitalist in Russia, with everyone endeavouring to frustrate
      the socialist revolution and embroil us in war. The situation is
      one where all the gains of the workers and peasants are at
      stake. We may be confident that we shall have the broad sympathy
      and support of the proletariat, and then the danger will be
      completely averted, and new ranks of the proletariat will come
      forward to stand up for their class and save the socialist
      revolution. As matters now stand, the struggle is being fought
      over two major issues, and all the main party differences have
      been obliterated in the fires of revolution. The Left
      Socialist-Revolutionary who keeps insistently reminding us that
      he is on the left, concealing himself behind a cloud of
      revolutionary phrases, while actually revolting against the
      Soviet government, is just the same a hireling of the Yaroslavl
      whiteguards. That is what he is in history and the revolutionary
      struggle! Today only two classes confront each other in the
      battle arena: the class struggle is between the proletariat,
      which is protecting the interests of the working people, and
      those protecting the interests of the landowners and
      capitalists. All talk about a Constituent Assembly, about an
      independent state and so on, which is being used to dupe the
      ignorant masses, has been exposed by the experience of the Czech
      and Caucasian Menshevik movements. Behind all this talk stand
      the same forces-the landowners and capitalists; and the Czech
      mutiny brings in its train the rule of the landowners and
      capitalists, just as the German occupation does. That is what
      the war is about!

    

      Comrades, the workers must close their ranks more firmly than
      ever and set an example of organisation and discipline in this
      struggle. Russia is still the only country which has severed all
      ties with the imperialists. True, we are bleeding from grave
      wounds. We have retreated in the face of the imperialist brute,
      playing for time, striking a blow at it here and there. But, as
      the Socialist Soviet Republic, we have remained
      independent. Performing our socialist work, we opposed the
      imperialism of the whole world; and this struggle is becoming
      clearer and clearer to the workers of the world, and their
      mounting indignation is bringing them nearer and nearer to the
      future revolution. It is over this that the struggle is being
      waged, because our Republic is the only country in the world not
      to march hand in hand with imperialism and not to allow millions
      of people to be slaughtered to decide whether the French or the
      Germans will rule the world. Our Republic is the only country to
      have broken away by force, by revolutionary means, from the
      world imperialist war, and to have raised the banner of
      socialist revolution. But it is being dragged back into the
      imperialist war, and being forced into the trenches. Let the
      Czechs fight the Germans, let the Russian bourgeoisie make their
      choice, let Milyukov decide, perhaps even in concurrence with
      Spiridonova and Kamkov, which imperialists to side with. But we
      declare we must be prepared to lay down our lives to prevent
      them deciding this question, for the salvation of the whole
      socialist revolution is at stake. (Applause.) I know
      there is a change of spirit among the peasants of the Saratov,
      Samara, and Simbirsk gubernias, where fatigue was most marked
      and fitness for military action was lowest of all. After
      experiencing the ravages of the Cossacks and Czechs, and having
      a real taste of what the Constituent Assembly and the cries
      “Down with the Brest Peace Treaty!” mean, they have
      realised that all this only leads to the return of the
      landowner, to the capitalist mounting the throne-and they are
      now becoming the most ardent champions of Soviet power. I have
      not the slightest doubt that the Petrograd and Moscow workers,
      who are marching at the head of the revolution, will understand
      the situation, will understand the gravity of the times and will
      act with greater determination than ever, and that the
      proletariat will smash both the Anglo-French and the Czech
      offensive in the interests of the socialist
      revolution. (Applause.).

      The session was called because of the critical position of the
      Soviet Republic which was cut off from her main sources of food
      supply, raw materials and fuel as a result of the foreign armed
      intervention and whiteguard revolts. A unanimous resolution was
      passed on Lenin’s report, moved by the Communist group.

      Reference is to a counter-revolutionary revolt of the
      Czechoslovak army corps engineered by the Entente with the
      active assistance of the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries. The corps was formed in Russia from
      Czech and Slovak prisoners of war before the October Socialist
      Revolution. In the summer of 1918 the corps numbered more than
      60,000 men (the total number of Czechoslovak prisoners of war
      was 200,000). After the establishment of Soviet power the corps
      was financed by the Entente. Tomás Masaryk, President of
      the Czechoslovak National Council and leader of the Czech
      bourgeois nationalists, proclaimed the corps part of the French
      army, and Entente representatives raised the question of its
      evacuation to France. The Soviet Government agreed to the
      evacuation, provided the Russian troops were allowed to return
      home from France. The agreement of March 26, 1918, allowed the
      corps to leave Russia via Vladivostok on the condition that it
      surrender its arms. But the commanders of the corps did not keep
      their word and provoked an armed revolt at the end of May on the
      instigation of the Entente. The governments of the U.S.A.,
      Britain and France openly supported the revolt in every possible
      way, while French officers took a direct part in it. Acting in
      close contact with the whiteguards and kulaks, the mutineers
      occupied a large part of the Urals, the Volga area and Siberia
      and restored bourgeois rule. In the occupied areas they formed
      whiteguard governments with Menshevik and SocialistRevolutionary
      participation-the Siberian government in Omsk, the Committee of
      Constituent Assembly members in Samara, etc. 

    

      On June 11, the Central Executive Committee of the Czechoslovak
      Communist groups in Russia addressed an appeal to the soldiers
      of the corps exposing the counter-revolutionary nature of the
      revolt and calling on them to join Czechoslovak units of the Red
      Army. Most Czech and Slovak prisoners of war were sympathetic to
      Soviet power and did not fall for the counter-revolutionary
      propaganda of the corps commanders. Realising they had been
      deceived, many left the corps, refusing to fight against Soviet
      power. About 12,000 fought for the Red Army. 

    

      The Volga area was liberated in the autumn of 1918. The
      whiteguard Czechs were completely routed along with
      Kolchak’s troops.

      units of Lenin refers to the counter-revolutionary revolt of the
      Left Socialist-Revolutionaries which took place on July 6-7,
      1918, as the Fifth All-Russia Congress of Soviets was meeting in
      Moscow. 

    

      The Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party was formed at its First
      National Congress held in November 1917. Until then its members
      had belonged to the Left wing of the Socialist-Revolutionary
      Party which had emerged during the First World War and was
      headed by M. A. Spiridonova, B. D. Kamkov and M. A. Natanson
      (Bobrov). At the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries constituted the majority in the
      SocialistRevolutionary group. The group split over the question
      of Congress attendance. The Right Socialist-Revolutionaries left
      the Congress on the directives of the Central Committee of their
      party and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries stayed and voted
      together with the Bolsheviks on the major items of the
      agenda. But they rejected the Bolsheviks’ invitation to
      join the Soviet Government. After long hesitation and so as to
      retain influence among the peasants, the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries came to an agreement with the
      Bolsheviks and their representatives took posts in the Council
      of People’s Commissars. They clashed with the Bolsheviks,
      however, on the fundamental questions of the socialist
      revolution and opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. In
      January and February 1918 the Central Committee of the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party campaigned against the
      Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty. Following its conclusion and
      ratification by the Fourth Congress of Soviets in March 1918 the
      Left Socialist-Revolutionaries resigned from the Council of
      People’s Commissars, but retained their posts on the
      boards of People ’s Commissariats and in local government
      bodies. As the socialist revolution developed in the countryside
      they went into opposition to Soviet power. 
      
    

      On June 24 the party’s Central Committee decided on
      revolt. 

    

      Defeated at the Fifth Congress of Soviets, the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries decided to torpedo the Brest-Litovak
      Peace Treaty and embroil the country in a war with Germany. On
      July 6 they assassinated the German Ambassador, Count Mirbach,
      in Moscow. 

    

      They followed this up with armed revolt. Their strike force was
      a unit under the command of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary
      Popov, a Cheka worker. They bombarded the Kremlin and seized the
      Telephone Exchange and the Telegraph Office which they held for
      two hours. They issued several provocative messages, bulletins
      and telegrams announcing that power had passed into their hands
      and that the entire population had greeted them
      enthusiastically. 

    

      The Fifth Congress of Soviets instructed the government to take
      urgent measures to suppress the revolt. The Left
      SocialistRevolutionary group at the Congress was
      arrested. Twenty-four hours after it had begun, by 2 p. m. July
      7, the revolt was put down due to the steps taken by the Soviet
      Government and the concerted action of the Moscow workers and
      garrison. The revolt was part of the anti-Soviet campaign of the
      counter-revolutionaries at home and the imperialists abroad, and
      was secretly supported by foreign diplomatic missions. The Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries tried to start revolts also in
      Petrograd, Vologda and other towns. 

    

      Following the suppression of the revolt the Fifth All-Russia
      Congress of Soviets adopted a decision to remove from the
      Soviets all Left Socialist-Revolutionaries who supported the
      reckless policy of their leaders. The Congress received numerous
      telegrams from workers and peasants all over the country
      welcoming the suppression of the revolt and expressing their
      readiness to defend Soviet power by arms.

      Dashnaktsutyun Party-Armenian nationalist party which arose in
      the early nineties of the last century and strove for liberation
      of the Turkish Armenians from subjugation to the sultan of
      Turkey. Besides the bourgeoisie it included many national
      intellectuals, petty bourgeoisie and working people who fell for
      the nationalist and socialist phrase-mongering. During the
      Revolution of 1905-07 the party drew close to the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries. In 1907 a congress of the party
      adopted a Narodnik type of “socialist” programme. 

    

      After the February 1917 revolution the Dashnaks supported the
      Provisional Government policy and, following the October
      Revolution, they joined with the block of Mensheviks,
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mussavatists. Between 1918 and
      1920 they headed the counter-revolutionary nationalist
      government of Armenia. Their policy tended to turn Armenia into
      a colony of the imperialists and bridgehead for the British and
      French imperialists and Russian whiteguards in the struggle
      against the Soviet Republic. In November 1920 the people of
      Armenia led by the Bolsheviks and Red Army units brought down
      the Dashnak government. After Soviet power had triumphed in
      Transcaucasia the Dasbnaktsutvun organisations were broken up. 

    

[6]
      Mussauatists—members of the nationalist Mussavat Party of
      the Azerbaijanian bourgeoisie and landowners, which was formed
      in 1912. During the October Revolution and Civil War it was the
      main counter-revolutionary force in Azerbaijan. After the fall
      of Soviet government in 1918, the Mussavatists came to power
      with the help of the Turkish and British interventionists. On
      April 28, 1920, the working people of Azerbaijan and Red Army
      units overthrew the Mussavatist government. 

    

[7]
      On July 25, 1918, an emergency session of the Baku Soviet
      discussed the political and military situation in Baku in
      connection with the Turkish offensive. Under the pretext of
      defending Baku, the Mensheviks, Dashnaks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries demanded that British-troops be called
      in "for help". The Bolshevik leaders of the Soviet government in
      Baku, S. G. Shahumyan, WA. Azizbekov, P. A. Djaparidze,
      Y. D. Zevin and others, rejected these treacherous demands. They
      declared that-to “invite” the British
      interventionists into Baku would he betraying the Soviet
      Republic and insisted on taking urgent measures to defend Baku
      with the forces available. The Bolsheviks, however, were
      narrowly defeated and a resolution was carried to call in the
      British. 

    

      Finding themselves outvoted, the Bolsheviks announced their
      resignation from the Council of People’s Commissars. But
      they soon realised their mistake and decided to stay on and
      utilise every opportunity to isolate and defeat the traitors. At
      its emergency meeting the Executive of the Baku Soviet decided
      that the People’s Commissars should retain their posts
      until settlement of the question of power. The Baku city
      Bolshevik conference held on July 27 decided not to relinquish
      power without a fight, urgently to organise the city’s
      defence under the leadership of the Council of People’s
      Commissars, announce general mobilisation and call on the
      workers to defend the city and Soviet government. In pursuance
      of this decision the Baku Council of People’s Commissars
      declared martial law in the city, instructed the Cheka to cut
      short counter-revolutionary propaganda and called on the workers
      of Baku to take to arms in defence of the city. 

    

      However, the efforts of the Communists and many Baku workers
      were frustrated by the treachery of the Dashnaks,
      SocialistRevolutionaries and Mensheviks. The Dashnak units left
      the front and the Turkish troops advanced ---through the exposed
      section. On July 31 Soviet power in Baku fell to the foreign
      interventionists and their agents. Among other causes of its
      fall were the failure of the Party organisations of Azerbaijan
      and the Baku Council of People’s Commissars to secure a
      firm alliance between the Baku proletariat and the working
      peasants of Azerbaijan and their mistakes over the national
      question, which were taken advantage of by the Mussavatists,
      Dashnaks and other counter-revolutionaries to deceive the
      people. 

    

      Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Dasimaks, the agents
      of the Entente, formed a counter-revolutionary
      government—the Dictatorship of the Central Caspianr
      Area. The Soviet leaders in Azerbaijan were arrested. On the
      night of September 19-20 twenty-six Baku Commissars
      (S. C. Shabumyan, M. A. Aziz bekov, P. A. Djaparidze,
      1. T. Fioletov, Y. D. Zevin, G. N. Korganov, M. (I. Vezirov and
      others) were shot by the British with the direct connivance of
      the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. 

    

[8]
      This refers to the whiteguard revolt in Yaroslavl which began on
      July 6, 1918. It was organised by the counter-revolutionary
      Union for the Defence of the Country and Freedom which was led
      by the Right Socialist-Revolutionary B. V. Savinkov. This
      revolt, like other counter-revolutionary revolts in Russia at
      that time, was supported by the Entente imperialists with the
      active participation of the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries. The Union received large sums of
      money from them. The revolt was part of the general plan of
      intervention in Russia and was timed to coincide with the revolt
      of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow (see Note 4). It
      was also planned to start simultaneous revolts in Murom,
      Kostroma, Rybinsk and other towns of the Volga area and central
      Russia. 

    

      On the eve of the revolt Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks
      and whiteguard officers gathered in Yaroslavl in large
      numbers. The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, being most
      influential, filled a number of responsible posts. On July 6,
      the mutineers occupied the centre of the town, the arsenal, the
      Post and Telegraph Office and other buildings. Party and Soviet
      workers were killed. The mutineers tried to seize the
      workers’ districts but encountered stubborn and organised
      resistance. Party organisations of the factories rallied the
      people, and armed workers and Red Army units went into
      battle. The Soviet Government sent military units and armed
      workers’ detachments from Moscow, Petrograd,
      Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Kostroma, Vologda and Rybinsk. On July 21,
      1918, the revolt was put down. 

    

[9]
      Lenin refers to the decree On the Organisation of the Village
      Poor and Supply to them of Grain, Prime Necessities and
      Agricultural implements which was endorsed by the All-Russia
      Central Executive Committee on June 11, 1918. The decree
      provided for the establishment of the Poor Peasants’
      Committees on local initiative. It charged the Committees with
      the task of taking stock of the food supplies of the peasant
      farms, ascertaining the kulaks’ food resources and
      assisting the Soviet supply bodies in requisitioning surpluses,
      as well as protecting and delivering confiscated grain to the
      state granaries. The Committees were also to supply the poor
      peasants with food at the expense of the kulak farms, distribute
      farm implements and manufactured goods, look after sowing and
      harvesting, protect the crops and combat grain profiteering. By
      the autumn of 1918 over 80,000 Poor Peasants’ Committees
      were functioning in the localities. They formed the strongholds
      and organs of the proletarian dictatorship in the
      countryside. Their establishment marked the extensive
      development of the socialist revolution in the villages. They
      played an outstanding part in suppressing the kulak
      counter-revolution and undermining the economic power of the
      kulaks through their partial expropriation. In a comparatively
      short period of time the Committees confiscated and turned over
      to the poor and middle peasants 50 million hectares of land, and
      requisitioned the hulk of the kulaks’ farm implements for
      distribution among the poor and economically weak middle
      peasants. Great credit is due to the Committees for carrying
      through the abolition of landed proprietorship and supplying
      foodstuffs to the hungry industrial centres and the Red
      Army. The Poor Peasants’ Committees were active in
      establishing collective agricultural enterprises, the artels and
      communes, which together with the state farms were the first
      stones laid in the foundation of the socialist
      countryside. According to incomplete data, the number of
      collective farms increased from 240 at the time the Poor
      Peasants’ Committees were created to 1,600 at the end of
      1918. The Committees took the initiative in forming Red Army
      units by recruiting volunteers from among the poor
      peasants. They also helped to consolidate local Soviets and
      purge them of kulak elements. 

    

      The Poor Peasants’ Committees were vastly important in
      strengthening the worker-peasant alliance and in winning over
      the middle peasants to the Soviet side. As Lenin pointed out, in
      their activities the Poor Peasants’ Committees were to
      rely on the middle as well as the poor peasants. They paved the
      way for a change-over from the policy of neutralising the middle
      peasants to a firm alliance with them. 

    

      By the autumn of 1918 the Poor Peasants’ Committees, which
      played a historic role in the socialist revolution, had outlived
      their usefulness. The Soviets were consolidated with the help of
      the Committees and the extensive network of rural Party
      cells. In view of this and also of the need to “consummate
      Soviet construction by establishing a uniform pattern of Soviets
      on the entire territory of the Soviet Republic” the
      Extraordinary Sixth AllRussia Congress of Soviets held in
      November 1918 decided to merge the Poor Peasants’
      Committees with the volost and village Soviets. 

    

[10]
      Lenin refers to the decree On the Organisation of the Village
      Poor and Supply to them of Grain, Prime Necessities and
      Agricultural implements which was endorsed by the All-Russia
      Central Executive Committee on June 11, 1918. The decree
      provided for the establishment of the Poor Peasants’
      Committees on local initiative. It charged the Committees with
      the task of taking stock of the food supplies of the peasant
      farms, ascertaining the kulaks’ food resources and
      assisting the Soviet supply bodies in requisitioning surpluses,
      as well as protecting and delivering confiscated grain to the
      state granaries. The Committees were also to supply the poor
      peasants with food at the expense of the kulak farms, distribute
      farm implements and manufactured goods, look after sowing and
      harvesting, protect the crops and combat grain profiteering. By
      the autumn of 1918 over 80,000 Poor Peasants’ Committees
      were functioning in the localities. They formed the strongholds
      and organs of the proletarian dictatorship in the
      countryside. Their establishment marked the extensive
      development of the socialist revolution in the villages. They
      played an outstanding part in suppressing the kulak
      counter-revolution and undermining Lenin refers to the peace
      treaty concluded between Soviet Russia and the countries of the
      Quadruple Alliance (Germany, AustriaHungary, Bulgaria and
      Turkey) on March 3, 1918, in Brest-Litovsk and ratified on March
      15 by the Extraordinary Fourth All Russia Congress of
      Soviets. The peace terms were very harsh. Germany and
      Austria-Hungary were to get Poland, nearly the whole of the
      Baltic region and part of Byelorussia. The Ukraine was to be
      severed from Russia and become dependent on Germany. Turkey was
      to get Ardahan, Batumi and Kars. In August 1918 Germany forced
      Soviet Russia to conclude a supplementary treaty and financial
      agreement which contained even harsher terms. 

    

      The Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty was concluded despite dogged
      resistance from Trotsky and the anti-Party group of “Left
      Communists.” Credit for its conclusion was due to
      Lenin’s efforts to overcome opposition. The peace was a
      judicious political compromise. It brought a respite from the
      war and enabled the Soviet government to demobilise the old,
      demoralised army and create a new Red Army, to launch socialist
      construction and gather strength for the coming struggle against
      internal counter-revolution and foreign intervention. The
      signing of the treaty also promoted the peace struggle, enhanced
      the revolutionary mood in the armies and among the people of all
      countries in the war. On November 13, following the revolution
      in Germany, which led to the downfall of the monarchy, the
      All-Russia Central Executive Committee repealed the treaty. 

    

[11]
      Lenin refers to the historic decree of the Council of
      People’s Commissars on the nationalisation of large-scale
      industry, approved on June 28, 1918, and published in 

      Izvestia

      No. 134 on June 30. Under the decree all big factories with
      basic capital of 200,0001,000,000 rubles and over were
      nationalised. The decree consummated the socialisation of the
      major means of production. It was preceded by the
      nationalisation of banks, big metallurgical plants, sugar
      refineries, coal and oil industries, water transport, etc. While
      establishing state ownership of large-scale industry, the
      Council of People’s Commissars left the nationalised
      enterprises, pending their transfer to Soviet economic bodies,
      “in the hands of their former owners for free use on lease
      terms”. The owners were held responsible for the
      maintenance and proper operation of the enterprises. The
      workers, technical staff and managers were brought into the
      service of the Soviet Republic. The Supreme Economic Council was
      obliged to draw up at short notice and circulate to all the
      nationalised enterprises detailed instructions on how to run
      them. Despite the enormous difficulties involved, the
      nationalisation was completed quickly due to the organisational
      measures of the Communist Party and the enthusiasm of the
      workers. By August 31 more than 3,000 enterprises had been
      nationalised. 

    

      The decree also announced the nationalisation of all
      privately-owned railways and communal services (water supply,
      gasworks, trams, etc.), which came under the control of local
      Soviets. 

    

[12]
      Black hundreds-monarchist gangs in tsarist Russia formed by the
      police to fight the revolutionary movement. They murdered
      revolutionaries, hounded progressives among the intellectuals
      and organised anti-Jewish pogroms.

      Comrades! A Russian Bolshevik who took part in the 1905 Revolution,
      and who lived in your country for many years afterwards, has
      offered to convey my letter to you. I have accepted his proposal
      all the more gladly because just at the present time the
      American revolutionary workers have to play an exceptionally
      important role as uncompromising enemies of American
      imperialism—the freshest, strongest and latest in joining
      in the world-wide slaughter of nations for the division of
      capitalist profits. At this very moment, the American
      multimillionaires, these modern slaveowners have turned an
      exceptionally tragic page in the bloody history of bloody
      imperialism by giving their approval—whether direct or
      indirect, open or hypocritically concealed, makes no
      difference—to the armed expedition launched by the brutal
      Anglo-Japanese imperialists for the purpose of throttling the
      first socialist republic. 
 The history of modern, civilised America opened with one of
    those great, really liberating, really revolutionary wars of which
    there have been so few compared to the vast number of wars of
    conquest which, like the present imperialist war, were caused by
    squabbles among kings, landowners or capitalists over the division
    of usurped lands or ill-gotten gains. That was the war the
    American people waged against the British robbers who oppressed
    America and held her in colonial slavery, in the same way as these
    “civilised” bloodsuckers are still oppressing and
    holding in colonial slavery hundreds of millions of people in
    India, Egypt, and all parts of the world. 
 About 150 years have passed since then. Bourgeois civilisation
    has borne all its luxurious fruits. America has taken first place
    among the free and educated nations in level of development of the
    productive forces of collective human endeavour, in the
    utilisation of machinery and of all the wonders of modern
    engineering. At the same time, America has become one of the
    foremost countries in regard to the depth of the abyss which lies
    between the handful of arrogant multimillionaires who wallow in
    filth and luxury, and the millions of working people who
    constantly live on the verge of pauperism. The American people,
    who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against
    feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest, capitalist
    stage of wage-slavery to a handful of multimillionaires, and find
    themselves playing the role of hired thugs who, for the benefit of
    wealthy scoundrels, throttled the Philippines in 1898 on the
    pretext of “liberating” them, and are throttling the
    Russian Socialist Republic in 1918 on the pretext of
    “protecting” it from the Germans. 
 The four years of the imperialist slaughter of nations,
    however, have not passed in vain. The deception of the people by
    the scoundrels of both robber groups, the British and the German,
    has been utterly exposed by indisputable and obvious facts. The
    results of the four years of war have revealed the general law of
    capitalism as applied to war between robbers for the division of
    spoils: the richest and strongest profited and grabbed most, while
    the weakest were utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.

    
      The British imperialist robbers were the strongest in number of
      “colonial slaves”. The British capitalists have not
      lost an inch of “their” territory (i.e., territory
      they have grabbed over the centuries), but they have grabbed all
      the German colonies in Africa, they have grabbed Mesopotamia and
      Palestine, they have throttled Greece, and have begun to plunder
      Russia. 
 The German imperialist robbers were the strongest in
    organisation and discipline of “their” armies, but
    weaker in regard to colonies. They have lost all their colonies,
    but plundered half of Europe and throttled the largest number of
    small countries and weak nations. What a great war of
    “liberation” on both sides! How well the robbers of
    both groups, the Anglo-French and the German capitalists, together
    with their lackeys, the social-chauvinists, i.e., the socialists
    who went over to the side of “their own ”
    bourgeoisie, have “defended their country”! 
 The American multimillionaires were, perhaps, richest of all,
    and geographically the most secure. They have profited more than
    all the rest. They have converted all, even the richest, countries
    into their tributaries. They have grabbed hundreds of billions of
    dollars. And every dollar is sullied with filth: the filth of the
    secret treaties between Britain and her “allies”,
    between Germany and her vassals, treaties for the division of the
    spoils, treaties of mutual “aid” for oppressing the
    workers and persecuting the internationalist socialists. Every
    dollar is sullied with the filth of “profitable” war
    contracts, which in every country made the rich richer and the
    poor poorer. And every dollar is stained with blood—from
    that ocean of blood that has been shed by the ten million killed
    and twenty million maimed in the great, noble, liberating and holy
    war to decide whether the British or the German robbers are to get
    most of the spoils, whether the British or the German thugs are to
    be foremost in throttling the weak nations all over the
    world. 
 While the German robbers broke all records in war atrocities, the
      British have broken all records not only in the number of colonies
      they have grabbed, but also in the subtlety of their disgusting
      hypocrisy. This very day, the Anglo-French and American bourgeois
      newspapers are spreading, in millions and millions of copies, lies and
      slander about Russia, and are hypocritically justifying their
      predatory expedition against her on the plea that they want to
      “protect” Russia from the Germans! 
 It does not require many words to refute this despicable and
    hideous lie; it is sufficient to point to one well-known fact. In
    October 1917, after the Russian workers had overthrown their
    imperialist government, the Soviet government, the government of
    the revolutionary workers and peasants, openly proposed a just
    peace, a peace without annexations or indemnities, a peace that
    fully guaranteed equal rights to all nations—and it proposed
    such a peace to all the belligerent countries. 
 It was the Anglo-French and the American bourgeoisie who
    refused to accept our proposal; it was they who even refused to
    talk to us about a general peace! It was they who
    betrayed the interests of all nations; it was they who prolonged
    the imperialist slaughter! 
 It was they who, banking on the possibility of dragging Russia
    back into the imperialist war, refused to take part in the peace
    negotiations and thereby gave a free hand to the no less predatory
    German capitalists who imposed the annexationist and harsh Brest
    Peace upon Russia! 
 It is difficult to imagine anything more disgusting than the
    hypocrisy with which the Anglo-French and American bourgeoisie are
    now “blaming” us for the Brest Peace
    Treaty. The very capitalists of those countries which could have
    turned the Brest negotiations into general negotiations for a
    general peace are now our “accusers”! The Anglo-French
    imperialist vultures, who have profited from the plunder of
    colonies and the slaughter of nations, have prolonged the war for
    nearly a whole year after Brest, and yet they “accuse”
    us, the Bolsheviks, who proposed a just peace to all
    countries, they accuse us, who tore up, published and
    exposed to public disgrace the secret, criminal treaties concluded
    between the ex-tsar and the Anglo-French capitalists. 
 The workers of the whole world, no matter in what country they
    live, greet us, sympathise with us, applaud us for breaking the
    iron ring of imperialist ties, of sordid imperialist treaties, of
    imperialist chains—for breaking through to freedom, and
    making the heaviest sacrifices in doing so—for, as a
    socialist republic, although torn and plundered by the
    imperialists, keeping out of the imperialist war and
    raising the banner of peace, the banner of socialism for the whole
    world to see. 
 Small wonder that the international imperialist gang hates us
    for this, that it “accuses” us, that all the lackeys
    of the imperialists, including our Right Socialist-Revolutionaries
    and Mensheviks, also “accuse” us. The hatred these
    watchdogs of imperialism express for the Bolsheviks, and the
    sympathy of the class-conscious workers of the world, convince us
    more than ever of the justice of our cause. 
 A real socialist would not fail to understand that for the
    sake of achieving victory over the bourgeoisie, for the sake of
    power passing to the workers, for the sake of starting
    the world proletarian revolution, we cannot and must
    not hesitate to make the heaviest sacrifices, including
    the sacrifice of part of our territory, the sacrifice of heavy
    defeats at the hands of imperialism. A real socialist would have
    proved by deeds his willingness for “his”
    country to make the greatest sacrifice to give a real push forward
    to the cause of the socialist revolution. 
 For the sake of “their” cause, that is, for the
    sake of winning world hegemony, the imperialists of Britain and
    Germany have not hesitated to utterly ruin and throttle a whole
    number of countries, from Belgium and Serbia to Palestine and
    Mesopotamia. But must socialists wait with “their”
    cause, the cause of liberating the working people of the whole
    world from the yoke of capital, of winning universal and lasting
    peace, until a path without sacrifice is found? Must they fear to
    open the battle until an easy victory is “guaranteed”?
    Must they place the integrity and security of “their”
    bourgeois-created “fatherland” above the interests of
    the world socialist revolution? The scoundrels in the
    international socialist movement who think this way, those lackeys
    who grovel to bourgeois morality, thrice stand condemned. 
 The Anglo-French and American imperialist vultures
    “accuse” us of concluding an “agreement”
    with German imperialism. What hypocrites, what scoundrels they are
    to slander the workers’ government while trembling because
    of the sympathy displayed towards us by the workers of
    “their own” countries! But their hypocrisy will be
    exposed. They pretend not to see the difference between an
    agreement entered into by “socialists” with the
    bourgeoisie (their own or foreign) against the workers,
    against the working people, and an agreement entered into for
    the protection of the workers who have defeated their
    bourgeoisie, with the bourgeoisie of one national colour
    against the bourgeoisie of another colour in order that
    the proletariat may take advantage of the antagonisms between the
    different groups of bourgeoisie. 
 In actual fact, every European sees this difference very well,
    and, as I shall show in a moment, the American people have had a
    particularly striking “illustration” of it in their
    own history. There are agreements and agreements, there are
    fagots et fagots, as the French say. 
 When in February 1918 the German imperialist vultures hurled
    their forces against unarmed, demobilised Russia, who had relied
    on the international solidarity of the proletariat before the
    world revolution had fully matured, I did not hesitate for a
    moment to enter into an “agreement” with the French
    monarchists. Captain Sadoul, a French army officer who, in words,
    sympathised with the Bolsheviks, but was in deeds a loyal and
    faithful servant of French imperialism, brought the French officer
    de Lubersac to see me. “I am a monarchist. My only aim is to
    secure the defeat of Germany,” de Lubersac declared to
    me. “That goes without saying (cela va sans dire
    ),” I replied. But this did not in the least prevent me
    from entering into an “agreement” with de Lubersac
    concerning certain services that French army officers, experts in
    explosives, were ready to render us by blowing up railway lines in
    order to hinder the German invasion. This is an example of an
    “agreement” of which every class-conscious worker will
    approve, an agreement in the interests of socialism. The French
    monarchist and I shook hands, although we knew that each of us
    would willingly hang his “partner”. But for a time our
    interests coincided. Against the advancing rapacious Germans,
    we, in the interests of the Russian and the world
    socialist revolution, utilised the equally rapacious
    counter-interests of other imperialists. In this way we
    served the interests of the working class of Russia and of other
    countries, we strengthened the proletariat and weakened the
    bourgeoisie of the whole world, we resorted to the methods, most
    legitimate and essential in every war, of manoeuvre,
    stratagem, retreat, in anticipation of the moment when the rapidly
    maturing proletarian revolution in a number of advanced countries
    completely matured. 
 However much the Anglo-French and American imperialist sharks
    fume with rage, however much they slander us, no matter how many
    millions they spend on bribing the Right Socialist-Revolutionary,
    Menshevik and other social-patriotic newspapers, I shall not
    hesitate one second to enter into a similar
    “agreement” with the German imperialist vultures if an
    attack upon Russia by Anglo-French troops calls for it. And I know
    perfectly well that my tactics will be approved by the
    class-conscious proletariat of Russia, Germany, France, Britain,
    America—in short, of the whole civilised world. Such tactics
    will ease the task of the socialist revolution, will hasten it,
    will weaken the international bourgeoisie, will strengthen the
    position of the working class which is defeating the
    bourgeoisie. 
 The American people resorted to these tactics long ago to the
    advantage of their revolution. When they waged their great war of
    liberation against the British oppressors, they had also against
    them the French and the Spanish oppressors who owned a part of
    what is now the United States of North America. In their arduous
    war for freedom, the American people also entered into
    “agreements” with some oppressors against others for
    the purpose of weakening the oppressors and strengthening those
    who were fighting in a revolutionary manner against oppression,
    for the purpose of serving the interests of the oppressed
    people. The American people took advantage of the strife
    between the French, the Spanish and the British; sometimes they
    even fought side by side with the forces of the French and Spanish
    oppressors against the British oppressors; first they defeated the
    British and then freed themselves (partly by ransom) from the
    French and the Spanish. 
 
      Historical action is not the pavement of Nevsky Prospekt, said
      the great Russian revolutionary Chernyshevsky.[2] A
      revolutionary would not “agree” to a proletarian
      revolution only “on the condition” that it proceeds
      easily and smoothly, that there is, from the outset, combined
      action on the part of the proletarians of different countries,
      that there are guarantees against defeats, that the road of the
      revolution is broad, free and straight, that it will not be
      necessary during the march to victory to sustain the heaviest
      casualties, to “bide one’s time in a besieged
      fortress”, or to make one’s way along extremely
      narrow, impassable, winding and dangerous mountain tracks. Such
      a person is no revolutionary, he has not freed himself from the
      pedantry of the bourgeois intellectuals; such a person will be
      found constantly slipping into the camp of the
      counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, like our Right
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and even (although more
      rarely) Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 Echoing the bourgeoisie, these gentlemen like to blame us for
    the “chaos” of the revolution, for the
    “destruction” of industry, for the unemployment and
    the food shortage. How hypocritical these accusations are, coming
    from those who welcomed and supported the imperialist war, or who
    entered into an “agreement” with Kerensky who
    continued this war! It is this imperialist war that is the cause
    of all these misfortunes. The revolution engendered by the war can
    not avoid the terrible difficulties and suffering bequeathed it by
    the prolonged, ruinous, reactionary slaughter of the nations. To
    blame us for the “destruction” of industry, or for the
    “terror”, is either hypocrisy or dull-witted pedantry;
    it reveals an inability to understand the basic conditions of the
    fierce class struggle, raised to the highest degree of intensity
    that is called revolution. 
 Even when “accusers” of this type do
    “recognise” the class struggle, they limit themselves
    to verbal recognition; actually, they constantly slip into the
    philistine utopia of class “agreement” and
    “collaboration”; for in revolutionary epochs the class
    struggle has always, inevitably, and in every country, assumed the
    form of civil war, and civil war is inconceivable without
    the severest destruction, terror and the restriction of formal
    democracy in the interests of this war. Only unctuous
    parsons—whether Christian or “secular” in the
    persons of parlour, parliamentary socialists— cannot see,
    understand and feel this necessity. Only a life less “man in
    the muffler”[3] can shun the revolution for this
    reason instead of plunging into battle with the utmost ardour and
    determination at a time when history demands that the greatest
    problems of humanity be solved by struggle and war. 
 The American people have a revolutionary tradition which has
    been adopted by the best representatives of the American
    proletariat, who have repeatedly expressed their complete
    solidarity with us Bolsheviks. That tradition is the war of
    liberation against the British in the eighteenth century and the
    Civil War in the nineteenth century. In some respects, if we only
    take into consideration the “destruction” of some
    branches of industry and of the national economy, America in 1870
    was behind 1860. But what a pedant, what an idiot would anyone be
    to deny on these grounds the immense, world-historic, progressive
    and revolutionary significance of the American Civil War of
    1863-65! 
 The representatives of the bourgeoisie understand that for the
    sake of overthrowing Negro slavery, of overthrowing the rule of
    the slaveowners, it was worth letting the country go through long
    years of civil war, through the abysmal ruin, destruction and
    terror that accompany every war. But now, when we are confronted
    with the vastly greater task of overthrowing capitalist
    wage-slavery, of overthrowing the rule of the
    bourgeoisie—now, the representatives and defenders of the
    bourgeoisie, and also the reformist socialists who have been
    frightened by the bourgeoisie and are shunning the revolution,
    cannot and do not want to understand that civil war is necessary
    and legitimate. 
 The American workers will not follow the bourgeoisie. They
    will be with us, for civil war against the bourgeoisie. The whole
    history of the world and of the American labour movement
    strengthens my conviction that this is so. I also recall the words
    of one of the most beloved leaders of the American proletariat,
    Eugene Debs, who wrote in the Appeal to Reason,[4] I believe towards the end of 1915, in
    the article “What Shall I Fight For” (I quoted this
    article at the beginning of 1916 at a public meeting of workers in
    Berne, Switzerland)[5]—that he, Debs, would rather be
    shot than vote credits for the present criminal and reactionary
    war; that he, Debs, knows of only one holy and, from the
    proletarian standpoint, legitimate war, namely: the war against
    the capitalists, the war to liberate mankind from
    wage-slavery. 
 I am not surprised that Wilson, the head of the American
    multimillionaires and servant of the capitalist sharks, has thrown
    Debs into prison. Let the bourgeoisie be brutal to the true
    internationalists, to the true representatives of the
    revolutionary proletariat! The more fierce and brutal they are,
    the nearer the day of the victorious proletarian revolution. 
 We are blamed for the destruction caused by our
    revolution. . . . Who are the accusers? The hangers-on of the
    bourgeoisie, of that very bourgeoisie who, during the four years
    of the imperialist war, have destroyed almost the whole of
    European culture and have reduced Europe to barbarism, brutality
    and starvation. These bourgeoisie now demand we should not make a
    revolution on these ruins, amidst this wreckage of culture, amidst
    the wreckage and ruins created by the war, nor with the people who
    have been brutalised by the war. How humane and righteous the
    bourgeoisie are! 
 
      Their servants accuse us of resorting to terror. . . . The
      British bourgeoisie have forgotten their 1649, the French
      bourgeoisie have forgotten their 1793. Terror was just and
      legitimate when the bourgeoisie resorted to it for their own
      benefit against feudalism. Terror became monstrous and criminal
      when the workers and poor peasants dared to use it against the
      bourgeoisie! Terror was just and legitimate when used for the
      purpose of substituting one exploiting minority for another
      exploiting minority. Terror became monstrous and criminal when
      it began to be used for the purpose of overthrowing
      every exploiting minority, to be used in the interests
      of the vast actual majority, in the interests of the proletariat
      and semi-proletariat, the working class and the poor peasants!
      
 The international imperialist bourgeoisie have slaughtered ten
    million men and maimed twenty million in “their” war,
    the war to decide whether the British or the German vultures are
    to rule the world. 
 If our war, the war of the oppressed and exploited
    against the oppressors and the exploiters, results in half a
    million or a million casualties in all countries, the bourgeoisie
    will say that the former casualties are justified, while the
    latter are criminal. 
 The proletariat will have something entirely different to say. 
 Now, amidst the horrors of the imperialist war, the
    proletariat is receiving a most vivid and striking illustration of
    the great truth taught by all revolutions and bequeathed to the
    workers by their best teachers, the founders of modern
    socialism. This truth is that no revolution can be successful
    unless the resistance of the exploiters is crushed. When
    we, the workers and toiling peasants, captured state power, it
    became our duty to crush the resistance of the exploiters. We are
    proud we have been doing this. We regret we are not doing it with
    sufficient firmness and determination. 
 We know that fierce resistance to the socialist revolution on the
      part of the bourgeoisie is inevitable in all countries, and that this
      resistance will grow with the growth of this revolution. The
      proletariat will crush this resistance; during the struggle against
      the resisting bourgeoisie it will finally mature for victory and for
      power. 
Let the corrupt bourgeois press shout to the whole world about
      every mistake our revolution makes. We are not daunted by our
      mistakes. People have not become saints because the revolution
      has begun. The toiling classes who for centuries have been
      oppressed, downtrodden and forcibly held in the vice of poverty,
      brutality and ignorance cannot avoid mistakes when making a
      revolution. And, as I pointed out once before, the corpse of
      bourgeois society cannot be nailed in a coffin and buried.[*]
      The corpse of capitalism is decaying and disintegrating in our
      midst, polluting the air and poisoning our lives, enmeshing that
      which is new, fresh, young and virile in thousands of threads
      and bonds of that which is old, moribund and decaying. 
 For every hundred mistakes we commit, and which the
    bourgeoisie and their lackeys (including our own Mensheviks and
    Right Socialist-Revolutionaries) shout about to the whole world,
    10,000 great and heroic deeds are performed, greater and more
    heroic because they are simple and inconspicuous amidst the
    everyday life of a factory district or a remote village, performed
    by people who are not accustomed (and have no opportunity) to
    shout to the whole world about their successes. 
 But even if the contrary were true—although I know such
    an assumption is wrong—even if we committed 10,000 mistake
    for every 100 correct actions we performed, even in that case our
    revolution would be great and invincible, and so it will be in
    the eyes of world history, because, for the first
    time, not the minority, not the rich alone, not the educated
    alone, but the real people, the vast majority of the working
    people, are themselves building a new life, are by
    their own experience solving the most difficult problems of
    socialist organisation . 
 Every mistake committed in the course of such work, in the
    course of this most conscientious and earnest work of tens of
    millions of simple workers and peasants in reorganising their
    whole life, every such mistake is worth thousands and millions of
    “lawless” successes achieved by the exploiting
    minority—successes in swindling and duping the working
    people. For only through such mistakes will the workers
    and peasants learn to build the new life, learn to do
    without 

      capitalists; only in this way will they hack a path for
      themselves—through thousands of obstacles—to
      victorious socialism. 
 Mistakes are being committed in the course of their
    revolutionary work by our peasants, who at one stroke, in one
    night, October 25-26 (old style), 1917, entirely abolished the
    private ownership of land, and are now, month after month,
    overcoming tremendous difficulties and correcting their mistakes
    themselves, solving in a practical way the most difficult tasks of
    organising new conditions of economic life, of fighting the
    kulaks, providing land for the working people (and not
    for the rich), and of changing to communist large-scale
    agriculture. 
 Mistakes are being committed in the course of their
    revolutionary work by our workers, who have already, after a few
    months, nationalised almost all the biggest factories and plants,
    and are learning by hard, everyday work the new task of managing
    whole branches of industry, are setting the nationalised
    enterprises going, overcoming the powerful resistance of inertia,
    petty-bourgeois mentality and selfishness, and, brick by brick,
    are laying the foundation of new social ties, of a
    new labour discipline, of a new influence of the
    workers’ trade unions over their members. 
 Mistakes are committed in the course of their revolutionary
    work by our Soviets, which were created as far back as 1905 by a
    mighty upsurge of the people. The Soviets of Workers and Peasants
    are a new type of state, a new and higher type
    of democracy, a form of the proletarian dictatorship, a means of
    administering the state without the bourgeoisie and
    against the bourgeoisie. For the first time democracy is
    here serving the people, the working people, and has ceased to be
    democracy for the rich as it still is in all bourgeois republics,
    even the most democratic. For the first time, the people are
    grappling, on a scale involving one hundred million, with the
    problem of implementing the dictatorship of the proletariat and
    semi-proletariat—a problem which, if not solved, makes
    socialism out of the question. 
 Let the pedants, or the people whose minds are incurably
    stuffed with bourgeois-democratic or parliamentary prejudices,
    shake their heads in perplexity about our Soviets, about the
    absence of direct elections, for example. These people have
    forgotten nothing and have learned nothing during the period of
    the great upheavals of 1914-18. The combination of the proletarian
    dictatorship with the new democracy for the working
    people—of civil war with the widest participation of the
    people in politics—such a combination cannot be brought
    about at one stroke, nor does it fit in with the outworn modes of
    routine parliamentary democracy. The contours of a new world, the
    world of socialism, are rising before us in the shape of the
    Soviet Republic. It is not surprising that this world does not
    come into being ready-made, does not spring forth like Minerva
    from the head of Jupiter. 
 The old bourgeois-democratic constitutions waxed eloquent
    about formal equality and right of assembly; but our proletarian
    and peasant Soviet Constitution casts aside the hypocrisy of
    formal equality. When the bourgeois republicans overturned thrones
    they did not worry about formal equality between monarchists and
    republicans. When it is a matter of overthrowing the bourgeoisie,
    only traitors or idiots can demand formal equality of rights for
    the bourgeoisie. “Freedom of assembly” for workers and
    peasants is not worth a farthing when the best buildings belong to
    the bourgeoisie. Our Soviets have confiscated all the
    good buildings in town and country from the rich and have
    transferred all of them to the workers and peasants for
    their unions and meetings. This is our freedom
    of assembly—for the working people! This is the meaning and
    content of our Soviet, our socialist Constitution! 
 That is why we are all so firmly convinced that no matter what
    misfortunes may still be in store for it, our Republic of Soviets
    is invincible. 
 It is invincible because every blow struck by frenzied
    imperialism, every defeat the international bourgeoisie inflict on
    us, rouses more and more sections of the workers and peasants to
    the struggle, teaches them at the cost of enormous sacrifice,
    steels them and engenders new heroism on a mass scale. 
 We know that help from you will probably not come soon,
    comrade American workers, for the revolution is developing in
    different countries in different forms and at different tempos
    (and it cannot be otherwise). We know that although the European
    proletarian revolution has been maturing very rapidly lately, it
    may, after all, not flare up within the next few weeks. We are
    banking on the inevitability of the world revolution, but this
    does not mean that we are such fools as to bank on the revolution
    inevitably coming on a definite and early date. We have
    seen two great revolutions in our country, 1905 and 1917, and we
    know revolutions are not made to order, or by agreement. We know
    that circumstances brought our Russian detachment of the
    socialist proletariat to the fore not because of our merits, but
    because of the exceptional backwardness of Russia, and that
    before the world revolution breaks out a number of
    separate revolutions may be defeated. 
 In spite of this, we are firmly convinced that we are
    invincible, because the spirit of mankind will not be broken by
    the imperialist slaughter. Mankind will vanquish it. And the first
    country to break the convict chains of the imperialist
    war was our country. We sustained enormously heavy
    casualties in the struggle to break these chains, but we
    broke them. We are free from imperialist
    dependence, we have raised the banner of struggle for the complete
    overthrow of imperialism for the whole world to see. 
 We are now, as it were, in a besieged fortress, waiting for
    the other detachments of the world socialist revolution to come to
    our relief. These detachments exist, they are more
    numerous than ours, they are maturing, growing, gaining more
    strength the longer the brutalities of imperialism continue. The
    workers are breaking away from their social traitors—the
    Gomperses, Hendersons, Renaudels, Scheidemanns and Renners. Slowly
    but surely the workers are adopting communist, Bolshevik tactics
    and are marching towards the proletarian revolution, which alone
    is capable of saving dying culture and dying mankind. 
 In short, we are invincible, because the world proletarian
      revolution is invincible.

      The dispatch of the letter to America was organised by the
      Bolshevik M. M. Borodin, who had recently been there. With the
      foreign military intervention and the blockade of Soviet Russia
      this involved considerable difficulties. The letter was
      delivered to the United States by P. I. Travin (Sletov). Along
      with the letter he brought the Constitution of the
      R.S.F.S.R. and the Soviet Government’s Note to President
      Wilson containing the demand to stop the intervention. The
      well-known American socialist and journalist John Reed secured
      the publication of all these documents in the American
      press. 
In December 1918 a slightly abridged version of
    the letter appeared in the New York magazine The Class
    Struggle and the Boston weekly The Revolutionary
    Age, both organs of the Left wing of the American Socialist
    Party. The Revolutionary Age was brought out by John Reed
    and Sen Katayama. The letter evoked keen interest among readers
    and it was published as a reprint from The Class Struggle
    in a large number of copies. Subsequently it was published many
    times in the bourgeois and socialist press of the U.S.A. and
    Western Europe, in the French socialist magazine Demain
    No. 28-29, 1918, in No. 138 of the Call, organ of the
    British Socialist Party, the Berlin magazine Die Aktion
    No. 51-52, 1918, and elsewhere. In 1934 the letter was brought out
    in New York in the form of a pamphlet, which contained the
    passages omitted in earlier publications. 
 The letter was widely used by the American
    Left Socialists and was instrumental in aiding the development of
    the labour and communist movement in the U.S. and Europe. It
    helped advanced workers to appreciate the nature of imperialism
    and the great revolutionary changes effected by the Soviet
    government. Lenin’s letter aroused a mounting protest in the
    U.S. against the armed intervention.

      history is not paved like Nevsky Prospekt; it runs across
      fields, either dusty or muddy, and cuts through swamps or forest
      thickets. Anyone who fears being covered with dust or muddying

      The proletarian and peasant revolutionary movement against the
      imperialist war has recently had tremendous successes in all
      countries, especially in the Balkans, Austria and Germany. These
      successes, however, have particularly embittered the
      international bourgeoisie, now headed by the Anglo-American and
      French bourgeoisie, and have forced them to make hasty efforts
      to organise themselves as a counter-revolutionary force for
      crushing the revolution and, above all for crushing Soviet power
      in Russia, which is the chief hotbed of revolution at present. 

    
 
      The German bourgeoisie and the German Government, defeated in
      the war and threatened by a mighty revolutionary movement from
      within, are threshing about in their search for salvation. One
      trend in the ruling circles of Germany still hopes by delays to
      gain time before the winter and to prepare for the
      country’s military defence on a new line of
      fortifications. Another trend is feverishly seeking agreement
      with the Anglo-French bourgeoisie against the revolutionary
      proletariat and the Bolsheviks. Since this trend is running up
      against the flat refusal of the victors, the Anglo-French
      imperialists, to strike a bargain, it is trying to frighten them
      with the Bolshevik danger and bribe them by offering its
      services against the Bolsheviks, against the proletarian
      revolution. 

    
 
      The bourgeoisie of the countries subordinated to Germany or
      occupied by her are still more eagerly seeking agreement with
      the Entente, especially in those cases—as, for example, in
      Finland, the Ukraine, etc.—where they are aware that it is
      completely impossible for them to maintain power over the
      exploited working people without the aid of foreign bayonets. 

    
 
      Owing to these circumstances, Soviet power finds itself in the
      following peculiar situation: on the one hand, we have never
      been so close to an international proletarian revolution as we
      are now; on the other hand, we have never been in such a
      perilous position as we are now. There are no longer two
      approximately equal groups of imperialist plunderers, devouring
      and weakening each other. There remains a single group of
      victors, the Anglo-French imperialists, which intends to divide
      the whole world among the capitalists. It intends to overthrow
      Soviet power in Russia at all costs and replace it by bourgeois
      power. It is preparing now to attack Russia from the South,
      through the Dardanelles and the Black Sea, for example, or
      through Bulgaria and Rumania. Moreover, at least a part of the
      Anglo-French imperialists evidently hope that the German
      Government, by a direct or tacit agreement with them, will
      withdraw its troops from the Ukraine only as the latter becomes
      occupied by Anglo-French troops, so as not to allow the
      otherwise inevitable victory of the Ukrainian workers and
      peasants and their establishment of a Ukrainian workers’
      and peasants’ government. 


 
      Behind the back of the Krasnov and whiteguard
      counter-revolutionaries, preparations are being made for an
      attack against us by a much more dangerous force, the force of
      the international counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, with the
      Anglo-American and French bourgeoisie in first place. This is a
      fact that is not realised everywhere and the awareness of which
      has not penetrated deep down among the broad mass of the workers
      and peasants. We must therefore tirelessly imbue this awareness
      in the people. The most assiduous attention must be devoted to
      strengthening the Southern Front and establishing and arming an
      incomparably mightier Red Army than we have now. Every
      workers’ organisation, every union of poor peasants, every
      Soviet institution must again and again give priority to the
      question of strengthening the army, and repeatedly re-examine
      whether we have done enough, and what new measures we could and
      should undertake. 

    
 
      A marked change has taken place in the mood of our workers and
      peasants. The people have overcome their extreme
      war-weariness. An army is being created and has been created. A
      new, communist discipline, a class-conscious discipline of the
      working people, has developed. And this fact gives us every
      reason to confidently expect that we can and will defend our
      socialist homeland and secure the victory of the international
      proletarian revolution.

Pravda today carries a remarkably
      interesting letter by Pitirim Sorokin, to which the special
      attention of all Communists should be drawn. In this letter,
      which was originally published in Izvestia of the North
      Dvina Executive Committee[1], Pitirim
      Sorokin announces that he is leaving the Right
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party and relinquishing his seat in the
      Constituent Assembly. His motives are that he finds it difficult
      to provide effective political recipes, not only for others, but
      even for himself, and that therefore he “is withdrawing
      completely from politics”. He writes: “The past year
      of revolution has taught me one truth: politicians may make
      mistakes, politics may be socially useful, but may also be
      socially harmful, whereas scientific and educational work is
      always useful and is always needed by the people. . . .”
      The letter is signed: “Pitirim Sorokin, lecturer at
      St. Petersburg University and the Psycho-Neurological Institute,
      former member of the Constituent Assembly and former member of
      the Socialist-Revolutionary Party”.
This letter is worth mentioning in the first place because it
      is an extremely interesting “human document”. We do
      not often meet such sincerity and frankness as are displayed by
      Sorokin in admitting the mistakenness of his politics. In
      practically the majority of cases politicians who become
      convinced that the line they have been pursuing is erroneous try
      to conceal their change of front, to hush it up, to
      “invent” more or less extraneous motives, and so
      on. A frank and honest admission of one’s political error
      is in itself an important political act. Pitirim Sorokin is
      wrong when he says that scientific work “is always
      useful”.

      For mistakes are made in this sphere too, and there are examples
      also in Russian literature of the obstinate advocacy of, for
      instance, reactionary philosophical views by people who are not
      conscious reactionaries. On the other hand, a frank declaration
      by a prominent person—i.e., a person who has occupied a
      responsible political post known to the people at
      large—that he is withdrawing from politics is also
      politics. An honest confession of a political error may be
      of great political benefit to many people if the error was
      shared by whole parties which at one time enjoyed influence over
      the people.
The political significance of Pitirim Sorokin’s letter is
      very great precisely at the present moment. It is a
      “lesson” which we should all seriously think over
      and learn thoroughly.
It is a truth long known to every Marxist that in every
      capitalist society the only decisive forces are the
      proletariat and the bourgeoisie, while all social elements
      occupying a position between these classes and coming within the
      economic category of the petty bourgeoisie inevitably
      vacillate between these decisive forces. But there is an
      enormous gulf between academic recognition of this truth and the
      ability to draw the conclusions that follow from it in the
      complex conditions of practical reality.
Pitirim Sorokin is representative of the Menshevik
      Socialist-Revolutionary trend, an extremely broad public and
      political trend. That this is a single trend, that the
      difference between the Mensheviks and the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries in their attitude towards the struggle
      between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat is insignificant, is
      especially convincingly and strikingly borne out by the events
      in the Russian revolution since February 1917. The Mensheviks
      and the Socialist-Revolutionaries are varieties of
      petty-bourgeois democrats—that is the economic essence and
      fundamental political characteristic of the trend in
      question. We know from the history of the advanced countries how
      frequently this trend in its early stages assumes a
      “socialist” hue.
What was it that several months ago so forcibly repelled those
      of this trend from the Bolsheviks, from the proletarian
      revolution, and what is it that is now inducing them to shift
      from hostility to neutrality? It is quite obvious that the cause
      of this shift was, firstly, the collapse of German imperialism
      in connection with the revolution in Germany and other
      countries, and the exposure of Anglo-French imperialism, and,
      secondly, the dispelling of bourgeois democratic illusions.
Let us deal with the first cause. Patriotism is one of the most
      deeply ingrained sentiments, inculcated by the existence of
      separate fatherlands for hundreds and thousands of years. One of
      the most pronounced, one might say exceptional, difficulties of
      our proletarian revolution is that it was obliged to pass
      through a phase of extreme departure from patriotism, the phase
      of the Brest-Litovsk Peace. The bitterness, resentment, and
      violent indignation provoked by this peace were easy to
      understand and it goes without saying that we Marxists could
      expect only the class-conscious vanguard of the proletariat to
      appreciate the truth that we were making and were obliged to
      make great national sacrifices for the sake of the supreme
      interests of the world proletarian revolution. There was no
      source from which ideologists who are not Marxists, and the
      broad mass of the working people, who do not belong to the
      proletariat trained in the long school of strikes and
      revolution, could derive either a firm conviction that the
      revolution was maturing, or an unreserved devotion to it. At
      best, our tactics appeared to them a fantastic, fanatical, and
      adventurist sacrifice of the real and most obvious interests of
      hundreds of millions for the sake of an abstract, utopian, and
      dubious hope of something that might occur abroad. And the petty
      bourgeoisie, owing to their economic position, are more
      patriotic than the bourgeoisie or the proletariat.
But it turned out as we had said.
German imperialism, which had seemed to be the only enemy,
      collapsed. The German revolution, which had appeared to be a
      “dream-farce” (to use Plekhanov’s expression),
      became a fact. Anglo-French imperialism, which the fantasy of
      the petty-bourgeois democrats had pictured as a friend of
      democracy and a protector of the oppressed, turned out to be a
      savage beast which imposed on the German Republic and the people
      of Austria terms worse than those of Brest, a savage beast which
      used armies of “free” republicans—French and
      American—as gendarmes, butchers and throttlers of the
      independence and freedom of small and weak nations. Anglo-French
      imperialism was exposed by world history with ruthless
      thoroughness and frankness. The facts of world history
      demonstrated to the Russian patriots, who formerly would hear of
      nothing that was not to the direct advantage (as formerly
      understood) of their country, that the transformation of our
      Russian revolution into a socialist revolution was not a dubious
      venture but a necessity, for there was no other
      alternative: Anglo-French and American imperialism will
      inevitably destroy the independence and freedom of
      Russia if the world socialist revolution, world Bolshevism, does
      not triumph.
Facts are stubborn things, as the English say. And during
      recent months we have witnessed facts that signify a most
      momentous turning-point in world history. These facts are
      compelling the petty-bourgeois democrats of Russia, in spite of
      their hatred of Bolshevism, a hatred inculcated by the history
      of our inner-Party struggle, to turn from hostility to
      Bolshevism first to neutrality and then to support of
      Bolshevism. The objective conditions which repelled these
      democratic patriots from us most strongly have now vanished. The
      objective conditions existing in the world now compel
      them to turn to us. Pitirim Sorokin’s change of front is
      by no means fortuitous, but rather the symptom of an inevitable
      change of front on the part of a whole class, of the
      whole petty-bourgeois democracy. Whoever fails to reckon with
      this fact and to take advantage of it is a bad socialist, not a
      Marxist.
Furthermore, faith in “democracy” in
      general, as a universal panacea, and failure to understand
      that this democracy is bourgeois democracy,
      historically limited in its usefulness and its necessity, have
      for decades and centuries been particularly characteristic of
      the petty bourgeoisie of all countries. The big bourgeois is
      case-hardened; he knows that under capitalism a democratic
      republic, like every other form of state, is nothing but a
      machine for the suppression of the proletariat. The big
      bourgeois knows this from his most intimate
      acquaintance with the real leaders and with the most profound
      (and therefore frequently the most concealed) springs of
      every bourgeois state machine. The petty bourgeois,
      Owning to his economic position and his conditions of life
      generally, is less able to appreciate this truth, and even
      cherishes the illusion that a democratic republic implies
      “pure democracy”, “a free people’s
      state”, the non-class or supra-class rule of the people, a
      pure manifestation of the will of the people, and so on and so
      forth. The tenacity of these prejudices of the petty-bourgeois
      democrat is inevitably due to the fact that he is farther
      removed from the acute class struggle, the stock exchange, and
      “real” politics; and it would be absolutely
      un-Marxist to expect these prejudices to be eradicated very
      rapidly by propaganda alone.
World history, however, is moving with such furious rapidity,
      is smashing everything customary and established with a hammer
      of such immense weight, by crises of such unparalleled
      intensity, that the most tenacious prejudices are giving
      way. The naïve belief in a Constituent Assembly and the
      naïve habit of contrasting “pure democracy”
      with “proletarian dictatorship” took shape naturally
      and inevitably in the mind of the “democrat in
      general”. But the experiences of the Constituent Assembly
      supporters in Archangel, Samara, Siberia and the South could not
      but destroy even the most tenacious of prejudices. The idealised
      democratic republic of Wilson proved in practice to be
      a form of the most rabid imperialism, of the most shameless
      oppression and suppression of weak and small nations. The
      average “democrat” in general, the Menshevik and the
      Socialist-Revolutionary, thought: “How can we even dream
      of some allegedly superior type of state, some Soviet
      government? God grant us even an ordinary democratic
      republic!” And, of course, in “ordinary”,
      comparatively peaceful times he could have kept on cherishing
      this “hope” for many a long decade.
Now, however, the course of world events and the bitter lessons
      derived from the alliance of all the Russian monarchists with
      Anglo-French and American imperialism are proving in
      practice that a democratic republic is a
      bourgeois-democratic republic, which is already out of date from
      the point of view of the problems which imperialism has placed
      before history. They show that there is no other
      alternative: either Soviet government triumphs in every
      advanced country in the world, or the most reactionary
      imperialism triumphs, the most savage imperialism, which is
      throttling the small and weak nations and reinstating reaction
      all over the world—Anglo-American imperialism, which has
      perfectly mastered the art of using the form of a democratic
      republic.
One or the other.
There is no middle course. Until quite recently this view was
      regarded as the blind fanaticism of the Bolsheviks.
But it turned out to be true.
If Pitirim Sorokin has relinquished his seat in the Constituent
      Assembly, it is not without reason; it is a symptom of a change
      of front on the part of a whole class, the petty-bourgeois
      democrats. A split among them is inevitable: one section will
      come over to our side, another section will remain neutral,
      while a third will deliberately join forces with the monarchist
      Constitutional-Democrats, who are selling Russia to
      Anglo-American capital and seeking to crush the revolution with
      the aid of foreign bayonets. One of the most urgent tasks of the
      present day is to take into account and make use of the turn
      among the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary democrats from
      hostility to Bolshevism first to neutrality and then to support
      of Bolshevism.
Every slogan the Party addresses to the people is bound to
      become petrified, become a dead letter, yet remain valid for
      many even when the conditions which rendered it necessary have
      changed. That is an unavoidable evil, and it is impossible to
      ensure the correctness of Party policy unless we learn to combat
      and overcome it. The period of our proletarian revolution in
      which the differences with the Menshevik and
      Socialist-Revolutionary democrats were particularly acute was a
      historically necessary period. It was impossible to avoid waging
      a vigorous struggle against these democrats when they swung to
      the camp of our enemies and set about restoring a bourgeois
      and imperialist democratic republic. Many of the slogans of
      this struggle have now become frozen and petrified and
      prevent us from properly assessing and taking effective
      advantage of the new period, in which a change of front has
      begun among these democrats, a change in our direction, not a
      fortuitous change, but one rooted deep in the conditions of the
      international situation.
It is not enough to encourage this change of front and amicably
      greet those who are making it. A politician who knows what he is
      working for must learn to bring about this change of
      front among the various sections and groups of the broad mass of
      petty-bourgeois democrats if he is convinced that serious and
      deep-going historical reasons for such a turn exist. A
      revolutionary proletarian must know whom to suppress and with
      whom—and when and how—to conclude an agreement. It
      would be ridiculous and foolish to refrain from employing terror
      against and suppressing the landowners and capitalists and their
      henchmen, who are selling Russia to the foreign imperialist
      “Allies”. It would be farcical to attempt to
      “convince” or generally to “psychologically
      influence” them. But it would be equally foolish and
      ridiculous—if not more so—to insist only on tactics
      of suppression and terror in relation to the petty-bourgeois
      democrats when the course of events is compelling them to turn
      in our direction.
The proletariat encounters these democrats everywhere. Our task
      in the rural districts is to destroy the landowner and smash the
      resistance of the exploiter and the kulak profiteer.  For this
      purpose we can safely rely only on the
      semi-proletarians, the “poor peasants”. But the
      middle peasant is not our enemy. He wavered, is wavering, and
      will continue to waver. The task of influencing the waverers
      is not identical with the task of overthrowing the
      exploiter and defeating the active enemy. The task at the
      present moment is to come to an agreement with the middle
      peasant—while not for a moment renouncing the struggle
      against the kulak and at the same time firmly relying solely on
      the poor peasant—for a turn in our direction on the part
      of the middle peasants is now inevitable owing to the causes
      enumerated above.
This applies also to the handicraftsman, the artisan, and the
      worker whose conditions are most petty-bourgeois or whose views
      are most petty-bourgeois, and to many office workers and army
      officers, and, in particular, to the intellectuals generally. It
      is an unquestionable fact that there often are instances in our
      Party of inability to make use of this change of front among
      them and that this inability can and must be overcome.
We already have the firm support of the vast majority of the
      proletarians organised in the trade unions. We must know how to
      win over the least proletarian and most petty bourgeois sections
      of the working people who are turning towards us, to
      include them in the general organisation and to subject them to
      general proletarian discipline. The slogan of the moment here is
      not to fight these sections, but to win them over, to be able to
      influence them, to convince the waverers, to make use of those
      who are neutral, and, by mass proletarian influence, to educate
      those who are lagging behind or who have only very recently
      begun to free themselves from “Constituent Assembly”
      or “patriotic democratic” illusions.
We already have sufficiently firm support among the working
      people. This was quite strikingly borne out by the Sixth
      Congress of Soviets. We are not afraid of the bourgeois
      intellectuals, but we shall not for a moment relax the struggle
      against the deliberate saboteurs and whiteguards among them. But
      the slogan of the moment is to make use of the change of
      attitude towards us which is taking place among them. There
      still remain plenty of the worst bourgeois specialists who have
      wormed themselves into Soviet positions. To throw them out, to
      replace them by specialists who yesterday were our convinced
      enemies and today are only neutral is one of the most important
      tasks of the present moment, the task of every active Soviet
      functionary who comes into contact with the
      “specialists”, of every agitator, propagandist, and
      organiser.
Of course, like every other political action in a complex and
      rapidly changing situation, agreement with the middle peasant,
      with the worker who was a Menshevik yesterday and with the
      office worker or specialist who was a saboteur yesterday, takes
      skill to achieve. The whole point is not to rest content with
      the skill we have acquired by previous experience, but under
      all circumstances to go on, under all circumstances to
      strive for something bigger, under all circumstances to
      proceed from simpler to more difficult tasks. Otherwise, no
      progress whatever is possible and in particular no progress is
      possible in socialist construction.
The other day I was visited by representatives from a congress
      of delegates of credit co-operative societies. They showed me
      the congress resolution[2] protesting
      against the merger of the Credit Co-operative Bank with
      the People’s Bank of the Republic. I told them that I
      stood for agreement with the middle peasants and highly valued
      even the beginnings of a change in attitude from hostility to
      neutrality towards the Bolsheviks on the part of the
      co-operators, but the basis for an agreement could be created
      only by their consent to the complete merger of their special
      bank with the single Bank of the Republic. The congress
      delegates thereupon replaced their resolution by another, which
      they had the congress adopt, and in which everything hostile to
      the merger was deleted; but . . . but what they
      proposed was a plan for a special “credit
      union” of co-operators, which in fact differed in no way
      from a special bank! That was ridiculous. Only a fool, of
      course, will be deceived by such verbiage. But the
      “failure” of one such . . .  “attempt”
      will not affect our policy in the least; we have pursued and
      will pursue a policy of agreement with the co-operators, the
      middle peasants, at the same time suppressing every attempt to
      change the policy of the Soviet government and of
      Soviet socialist construction.
Vacillation on the part of the petty-bourgeois democrats is
      inevitable. It was enough for the Czechs to win a few victories
      for these democrats to fall into a panic, to begin to spread
      panic, to hasten to the side of the “victors”, and
      be ready to greet them in a servile manner. Of course, it must
      not be forgotten for a moment that now, too, any partial success
      of, let us say, the Anglo-American-Krasnov whiteguards would be
      enough for vacillation to begin in the other direction,
      increasing panic and multiplying cases of the dissemination of
      panic, of treachery, and desertion to the imperialists, and so
      on and so forth.
We are aware of that. We shall not forget it. The purely
      proletarian basis we have won for the Soviet government, which
      is supported by the semi-proletarians, will remain firm and
      enduring. Our ranks will not falter, our army will not
      waver—that we already know from experience. But when
      profound world-historic changes bring about an inevitable turn
      in our direction among the mass of non-Party, Menshevik, and
      Socialist-Revolutionary democrats, we must learn and shall learn
      to make use of this change of front, to encourage it, to induce
      it among the various groups and sections of the population, to
      do everything possible to reach agreement with them and thus
      facilitate the work of socialist construction and ease the
      burden of grievous economic dislocation, ignorance, and
      incompetence which are delaying the victory of socialism.

Background
and Description of the First Congress


 

Speech at the Opening Session of the Congress
March 2

      On behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist
      Party I declare the First Congress of the Communist
      International open.  First I would ask all present to rise in
      tribute to the finest representatives of the Third
      International: 
      Karl Liebknecht  and 
      Rosa Luxemburg .  ( All rise .)

    

      Comrades, our gathering has great historic significance.  It
      testifies to the collapse of all the illusions cherished by
      bourgeois democrats.  Not only in Russia, but in the most
      developed capitalist countries of Europe, in Germany for
      example, civil war is a fact.

    

      The bourgeois are terror-stricken at the growing workers’
      revolutionary movement.  This is understandable if we take into
      account that the development of events since the imperialist war
      inevitably favors the workers’ revolutionary movement, and that
      the world revolution is beginning and growing in intensity
      everywhere.

    

      The people are aware of the greatness and significance of the
      struggle now going on. All that is needed is to find the
      practical form to enable the proletariat to establish its rule.
      Such a form is the  Soviet
      system  with the dictatorship of the proletariat.
      Dictatorship of the proletariat—until now these words
      were Latin to the masses.  Thanks to the spread of the Soviets
      throughout the world this Latin has been translated into all
      modern languages; a practical form of dictatorship has been
      found by the working people.  The mass of workers now understand
      it thanks to Soviet power in Russia, thanks to the 
      Spartacus League  in Germany and to similar organizations in
      other countries, such as, for example, the 
      Shop Stewards Committees in Britain .  All this shows that a
      revolutionary form of the dictatorship of the proletariat has
      been found, that the proletariat is now able to exercise its
      rule.

    

      Comrades, I think that after the events in Russia and the
      January struggle in Germany, it is especially important to note
      that in other countries, too, the latest form of the workers’
      movement is asserting itself and getting the upper hand.  Today,
      for example, I read in an anti-socialist newspaper a report to
      the effect that the British government had received a deputation
      from the Birmingham Workers’ Counsel and had expressed its
      readiness to recognize the Councils as economic bodies.  [A] The Soviet
      system has triumphed not only in backward Russia, but also in
      the most developed country of Europe—in Germany, and in
      Britain, the oldest capitalist country.

    

      Even though the bourgeoisie are still raging, even though they
      may kill thousands more workers, victory will be ours, the
      victory of the worldwide Communist revolution is assured.  

    

      Comrades, I extend hearty greetings to you on behalf of the
      Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party.  I move that
      we elect a presidium.  Let us  have nominations. [B]

      Thesis and Report on Bourgeois Democracy and the Dictatorship of
      the Proletariat
      March 4
    

      1.  Faced with the growth of the revolutionary workers’ movement
      in every country, the bourgeoisie and their agents in the
      workers’ organizations are making desperate attempts to find
      ideological and political arguments in defense of the rule
      of the exploiters.  Condemnation of dictatorship and a sense
      of democracy are particularly prominent among these
      arguments.  The falsity and hypocrisy of this argument,
      repeated in a thousand strains by the capitalist press and
      at the 
Berne yellow International Conference  in February 1919,
      are obvious to all who refuse to betray the fundamental
      principles of socialism.

    


      2.  Firstly, this argument employs the concepts of
      “democracy in general” and “dictatorship
      in general “, without posing the question of the class
      concerned.  This nonclass or above class presentation, which
      supposedly is popular, is an outright travesty of the basic
      tenet of socialism, namely, its theory of class struggle,
      which Socialists who have sided with the bourgeoisie
      recognize in words but disregard in practice.  For in no
      civilized capitalist country does “democracy in
      general” exist; all that exists is bourgeois
      democracy, and it is not a question of “dictatorship
      in general", but of the dictatorship of the oppressed class,
      i.e., the proletariat, over its oppressors and exploiters,
      i.e., the bourgeoisie, in order to overcome the resistance
      offered by the exploiters in their fight to maintain their
      domination.

    

      3.  History teaches us that no oppressed class ever did, or could, achieve power without going through a period of dictatorship, i.e., the conquest of political power and forceable suppression of the resistance always offered by the exploiters—the resistance that is most desperate, most furious, and that stops at nothing.  The bourgeoisie, whose domination is now defended by the Socialists who denounce “dictatorship in general” and extol “democracy in general", won power in the advanced countries through a series of insurrections, civil wars, and the forcible suppression of kings, feudal lords, slaveowners and their attempts at restoration.  In books, pamphlets, Congress resolutions, and propaganda speeches, Socialists have everywhere thousands and millions of times explained to people the class nature of these bourgeois revolutions and this bourgeois dictatorship.  That is why the present defense of bourgeois democracy under the cover of talk about “democracy in general", and the present howls and shouts against proletarian dictatorship under the cover of shouts about “dictatorship in general", are an outright betrayal of socialism.  They are, in fact, desertion to the bourgeoisie, denial of the proletariat’s right to its own, proletarian revolution, and a defense of bourgeois  reformism  at the very historical juncture when bourgeois reformism throughout the world has collapsed and
 the war has created a revolutionary situation.

    

      4.  In explaining the class nature of bourgeois civilization,
 bourgeois democracy and the bourgeois parliamentary system,
 all Socialists have expressed the idea formulated with the
 greatest scientific precision by Marx and Engels [Engels
 Introduction to the The Civil War in France],
 namely, that the most democratic bourgeois republic is no
 more than a machine for the suppression of the working class
 by the bourgeoisie, for the suppression of the working
 people by a handful of capitalists. There is not a single
 revolutionary, not a single Marxist among those now shouting
 against dictatorship and for democracy, who has not sworn
 and vowed to the workers that he excepts this basic truth of
 socialism.  But now, when the revolutionary proletariat is
 in a fighting mood and taking action to destroy this machine
 of oppression and to establish proletarian dictatorship,
 these traitors to socialism claim that the bourgeoisie have
 granted the working people “pure democracy", have abandoned
 resistance and are prepared to yield to the majority of the
 working people.  They assert that in a democratic republic
 there is not, and never has been, any such thing as a state
 machine for the suppression of labor by capital.

    

      5.  The 
Paris Commune —to which all who parade as
      Socialists pay lip service (for they know that the workers
      ardently and sincerely sympathize with though Commune)
      —showed very clearly the historically conventional
      nature and limited value of the bourgeois parliamentary
      system and bourgeois democracy; institutions which, though
      highly progressive compared with medieval times, inevitably
      require a radical alteration in the era of proletarian
      revolution.  It was Marx who best appraised the historical
      significance of the Commune.  

      In
his analysis, 

      he revealed the exploiting nature of
      bourgeois democracy in the bourgeois parliamentary system
      under which the oppressed classes enjoy the right to decide
      once in several years which representative of the propertied
      classes shall “represent and suppress” ( ver- und
zertreten ) the people in parliament. And it is now,
      when the Soviet movement is embracing the entire world and
      continuing the work of the Commune for all to see, that the
      traitors to socialism are forgetting the concrete experience
      and concrete lessons of the Paris Commune and repeating the
      old bourgeois rubbish about “democracy in general”.  The
      Commune was not a parliamentary institution.
      
    

      6.  The significance of the commune, furthermore, lies in the
 fact that it endeavored to crush, to smash to its very
 foundations, the bourgeois state apparatus, the
 bureaucratic, judicial, military and police machine, and to
 replace it by a self-governing, mass workers’ organization
 in which there was no division between legislative and
 executive power.  All contemporary bourgeois-democratic
 republic’s, including the German republic—which the
 traitors to socialism, in mockery of the truth, describe as
 a proletarian republic—retain this state apparatus.
 We therefore again get quite clear confirmation of the point
 that shouting in defense of “democracy in general” is
 actually defense of the bourgeoisie and their privileges as
 exploiters.

    

      7.  “Freedom of assembly” can be taken as a sample of the
 requisites of “pure democracy”.  Every class conscience
 worker who has not broken with his class will readily
 appreciate the absurdity of promising freedom of assembly to
 the exploiters at a time and in a situation when the
 exploiters are resisting the overthrow of their rule and are
 fighting to retain their privileges.  When the bourgeoisie
 were revolutionary, they did not, neither in England in 1649
 nor in France in 1793, grant “freedom of assembly” to the
 monarchists and nobles, who summoned foreign troops and
 “assembled” to organize attempts at restoration.  If the
 present day bourgeoisie, who have long since become
 reactionary, demand from proletariat advance guarantees of
 “freedom of assembly” for the exploiters, whatever the
 resistance offered by the capitalists to being expropriated,
 the workers will only laugh at their hypocrisy.

    

      The workers know perfectly well, too, that even in the most
      democratic bourgeois republic “freedom of assembly” is a hollow
      phrase, for the rich have the best public and private buildings
      at their disposal, and enough leisure to assemble at meetings,
      which are protected by the bourgeois machine of power.  The
      rural and urban workers and small peasants—the
      overwhelming majority of the population—are denied all
      these things.  As long as that state of affairs prevails,
      “equality", i.e., “pure democracy", is a fraud.  The first thing
      to do to win genuine equality and enable the working people to
      enjoy democracy in practice is to deprive the exploiters of all
      the public and sumptuous private buildings, to give to the
      working people leisure and to see to it that their freedom of
      assembly is protected by armed workers, not by heirs of the
      nobility or capitalist officers in command of downtrodden
      soldiers.

    

      Only when that change is affected can we speak of freedom of
      assembly and of equality without mocking at the workers, at
      working people in general, at the poor.  And this change can be
      affected only by the vanguard of the working people, the
      proletariat, which overthrows the exploiters, the bourgeoisie.

    

      8.  “Freedom of the press” is another of the principal slogans
      of “pure democracy”.  And here, too, the workers know —
      and Socialists everywhere have explained millions of times
      —that this freedom is a deception because the best
      printing presses and the biggest stocks of paper are
      appropriated by the capitalists, and while capitalist rule
      over the press remains—a rule that is manifested
      throughout the whole world all the more strikingly, sharply
      and cynically—the more democracy and the republican
      system are developed, as in America for example.  The first
      thing to do to win really equality and genuine democracy for
      the working people, for the workers and peasants, is to
      deprive capital of the possibility of hiring writers, buying
      publishing houses and bribing newspapers.  And to do that
      the capitalists and exploiters have to be overthrown and
      their resistance oppressed.  The capitalists have always use
      the term “freedom” to mean freedom for the rich to get
      richer and for the workers to starve to death.  And
      capitalist usage, freedom of the press means freedom of the
      rich to bribe the press, freedom to use their wealth to
      shape and fabricate so-called public opinion.  In this
      respect, too, the defenders of “pure democracy” prove to be
      defenders of an utterly foul and venal system that gives the
      rich control over the mass media.  They prove to be
      deceivers of the people, who, with the aid of plausible,
      fine-sounding, but thoroughly false phrases, divert them
      from the concrete historical task of liberating the press
      from capitalist enslavement.  Genuine freedom and equality
      will be embodied in the system which the Communists are
      building, and in which there will be no opportunity for
      massing wealth at the expense of others, no objective
      opportunities for putting the press under the direct or
      indirect power of money, and no impediments in the way of
      any workingman (or groups of workingman, in any numbers) for
      enjoying and practicing equal rights in the use of public
      printing presses and public stocks of paper.
      
    

      9.  The history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
 demonstrated, even before the war, what this celebrated
 “pure democracy” really is under capitalism.  Marxists have
 always maintained that the more developed, the “purer"
 democracy is, the more naked, acute and merciless the class
 struggle becomes, and the “purer” the capitalist oppression
 and bourgeois dictatorship.  The Dreyfus case in republican
 France, the massacre of strikers by hired bands armed by the
 capitalists in the free and democratic American republic
—these and thousands of similar facts illustrate the
 truth which the bourgeoisie are mainly seeking to conceal,
 namely, that actually terror and bourgeois dictatorship
 prevail in the most democratic of republics and are openly
 displayed every time the exploiters think the power of
 capital is being shaken.

    

      10.  The imperialist war of 1914-18 conclusively revealed even
  to backward workers the true nature of bourgeois democracy,
  even in the freest republics, as being a dictatorship of
  the bourgeoisie.  Tens of millions were killed for the sake
  of enriching the German or the British group of
  millionaires and multimillionaires, and bourgeois military
  dictatorships were established in the freest republics.
  This military dictatorship continues to exist in the Allied
  countries even after Germany’s defeat.  It was mostly the
  war that opened the eyes of the working people, that
  striped bourgeois democracy of its camouflage and showed
  the people the abyss of speculation and profiteering that
  existed during because of the war.  It was in the name of
  “freedom and equality” that the bourgeoisie wage the war,
  in the name of “freedom and equailty” that the munitions
  manufacturers piled up fabulous fortunes.  Nothing that the
  yellow Berne International does can conceal from the people
  the now thoroughly exposed exploiting character of
  bourgeois freedom, bourgeois equality and bourgeois
  democracy.

    

      11.  In Germany, the most developed capitalist country of
  Continental Europe, the very first months of full
  Republican freedom, establish as a result of imperialist
  Germany’s defeat, have shown the German workers and the
  whole world the true class substance of the
  bourgeois-democratic republic.  The murder of  Karl
  Liebknecht  and Rosa Luxemburg  is an event of epoch-making
  significance not only because of the tragic death of these
  finest people and leaders of the truly proletarian,
  Communist International, but also because the class nature
  of an advanced European state—it can be said without
  exaggeration, of an advanced state, on a worldwide scale
 —has been conclusively exposed.  If those arrested,
  i.e., those placed under state protection, could be
  assassinated by officers and capitalists with impunity, and
  this under the government headed by social patriots, in the
  democratic republic where such a thing was possible is a
  bourgeois dictatorship.  Those who voice their indignation
  at the murder of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg but
  fail to understand this fact are only demonstrating their
  stupidity, or hypocrisy.  “Freedom” in the German republic,
  one of the freest and advanced republics of the world, is
  freedom to murder arrested leaders of the proletariat with
  impunity.  Nor can it be otherwise as long as capitalism
  remains, for the development of democracy sharpens rather
  than dampens the class struggle which, by virtue of all the
  results and influences of the war and of its consequences,
  has been brought to boiling point.

    

      Throughout the civilized world we see Bolsheviks being exiled,
      persecuted and thrown into prison.  This is the case, for
      example, in Switzerland, one of the freest bourgeois republics,
      and in America, where there has been anti-Bolshevik pogroms,
      etc. .  From the standpoint of “democracy in general", or “pure
      democracy", it is really ridiculous that advanced, civilized,
      and democratic countries, which are armed to the teeth, should
      fear the presence of a few score men from backward, famine
      stricken and ruined Russia, which the bourgeois papers, in tens
      of millions of copies, described as savage, criminal, etc..
      Clearly, the social situation that could produce this crying
      contradiction is in fact a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.

    

      12.  In these circumstances, proletarian dictatorship is not
  only an absolutely legitimate means of overthrowing
  exploiters and suppressing the resistance, but also
  absolutely necessary to the entire mass of working people,
  being their only defense against the bourgeois dictatorship
  which led to the war and is preparing new wars.

    

      The main thing that Socialists fail to understand—which
      constitutes their shortsightedness in matters of theory, their
      subservience to bourgeois prejudices, and their political
      betrayal of the proletariat—is that in capitalist
      society, whenever there is any serious aggravation of the class
      struggle intrinsic to that society, there can be no alternative
      but the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie or the dictatorship of
      the proletariat.  Dreams of some third way are reactionary,
      petty-bourgeois limitations.  That is borne out by more than a
      century of development of bourgeois democracy in the
      working-class movement in all the advanced countries, and
      notably by the experience of the past five years.  This is also
      borne out by the whole science of political economy, by the
      entire content of Marxism, which reveals the economic
      inevitability, wherever commodity economy prevails, of the
      dictatorship of the bourgeoisie that can only be replaced by the
      class which the very growth of capitalism develops, multiplies,
      welds together and strengthens; that is, the proletarian class.

    

      13.  Another theoretical and political error of the Socialists
  is their failure to understand that ever since the
  rudiments of democracy first appeared in antiquity, its
  forms notably changed over the centuries as one ruling
  class replaced another.  Democracy assumed different forms
  and was applied in different degrees in the ancient
  republics of Greece, the medieval cities and the advanced
  capitalist countries.  It would be sheer nonsense to think
  that the most profound revolution in human history, the
  first case in the world of power being transferred from the
  exploiting minority to the exploited majority, could take
  place within the time-worn framework of the old, bourgeois,
  parliamentary democracy, without drastic changes, without
  the creation of new forms of democracy, new institutions
  that embody the new conditions for applying democracy, etc.

    

      14.  Proletarian dictatorship is similar to dictatorship of
  other classes in that it arises out of the need, as every
  other dictatorship does, to forcibly suppresses the
  resistance of the class that is losing its political sway.
  The fundamental distinction between the dictatorship of the
  proletariat and a dictatorship of the other classes —
  landlord dictatorship in the Middle Ages and bourgeois
  dictatorship in all civilized capitalist countries —
  consists in the fact that the dictatorship of landowners
  and bourgeoisie was a forcible suppression of the
  resistance offered by the vast majority of the population,
  namely, the working people.  In contrast, proletarian
  dictatorship is a forcible suppression of the resistance of
  the exploiters, i.e., of an insignificant minority the
  population, the landlords and capitalists.

    

      It follows that proletarian dictatorship must inevitably entail
      not only a change in the democratic forms and institutions,
      generally speaking, but precisely such change as provides an
      unparalleled extension of the actual enjoyment of democracy by
      those oppressed by capitalism—the toiling classes.

    

      And indeed, the form of proletarian dictatorship that has
      already taken shape, i.e., Soviet power in Russia, the
      Räte-System in Germany, the Shop Stewards Committees in
      Britain and similar Soviet institutions in other countries, all
      this implies and presents to the toiling classes, i.e., the vast
      majority of the population, greater practical opportunities for
      enjoying democratic rights and liberties than ever existed
      before, even approximately, in the best and the most democratic
      bourgeois republics.

    

      The substance of Soviet government is that the permanent and
      only foundation of state power, the entire machinery of state,
      is the mass scale organization of the classes oppressed by
      capitalism, i.e., the workers and semi-proletarians (peasants
      who do not exploit the labor of others and regularly resort to
      the sale of at least a part of their own labor power).  It is
      the people, who even in the most democratic bourgeois republics,
      while possessing equal rights by law, have in fact been debarred
      by thousands of devices and subterfuges from participation in
      political life and enjoyment of democratic rights and liberties,
      that are now drawn into constant and unfailing, moreover,
      decisive, participation in the democratic administration of the
      state.

    

      15.  The equality of citizens, irrespective of sex, religion,
  race, or nationality, which bourgeois democracy everywhere
  has always promised but never affected, and never could
  affect because of the domination of capital, is given
  immediate and full effect by the Soviet system, or
  dictatorship of the proletariat.  The fact is that this can
  only be done by a government of the workers, who are not
  interested in the means of production being privately owned
  and in the fight for their division and redivision.

    

      16.  The old, i.e., bourgeois, democracy and the parliamentary
  system were so organized that it was the mass of working
  people who were kept farthest away from a machinery of
  government.  Soviet power, i.e., the dictatorship of the
  proletariat, on the other hand, is so organized as to bring
  the working people close to the machinery of government.
  That, too, is the purpose of combining the legislative and
  executive authority under the Soviet organization of the
  state and of replacing territorial constituencies by
  production units—the factory.

    

      17.  The Army was a machine of oppression not only under the
  monarchy.  It remains as such in all bourgeois republics,
  even the most democratic ones.  Only the Soviets, the
  permanent organizations of government authority of the
  classes that were oppressed by capitalism, are in a
  position to destroy the Army’s subordination to bourgeois
  commanders and really merge the proletariat with the Army;
  only the Soviets can effectively arm the proletariat and
  disarm the bourgeoisie.  Unless this is done, the victory
  of socialism is impossible.

    

      18.  The Soviet organization of the state is suited to the
  leading role of the proletariat as a class most
  concentrated and enlightened by capitalism.  The experience
  of all revolutions and all movements of the oppressed
  classes, the experience of the world Socialist movement
  teaches us that only the proletariat is in a position to
  unite and lead the scattered and backward sections of the
  working and exploited population. 

    

      19.  Only the Soviet government of the state can really affect
  the immediate breakup and total destruction of the old,
  i.e., bourgeois, bureaucratic and judicial machinery, which
  has been, and has inevitably had to be, retained under
  capitalism even in the most democratic republics, and which
  is, in actual fact, the greatest obstacle to the practical
  implementation of democracy for the workers and working
  people generally.  The Paris Commune took the first epoch
  making step along this path.  The Soviet system has taken
  the second.

    

      20.  Destruction of state power is the aim set by all
  Socialists, including Marx above all.  Genuine democracy,
  i.e., Liberty and equality, is unrealizable unless this aim
  is achieved.  But it’s practical achievement as possible
  only through Soviet, or proletarian, democracy, for by
  enlisting the mass organizations of the working people in
  constant and unfailing participation in the administration
  of the state, it immediately begins to prepare the complete
  withering away of any state.

    

      21.  The complete bankruptcy of the Socialists who assembled in
  Berne, their complete failure to understand the new, i.e.,
  proletarian, democracy, is especially apparent from the
  following.  On February 10, 1919, Branting delivered the
  concluding speech at the International Conference of the
  yellow International in Berne.  In Berlin, on February 11,
  1919, Die
  Freiheit, the paper of the International’s affiliates,
  published an appeal from the party of “Independence” to the
  proletariat.  The appeal acknowledged the bourgeois
  character of the Scheidemann government, rebuked it for
  wanting to abolish the Soviets, which are described as
  Träger und Schutzer der Revolution  —
  vehicles and guardians of the revolution—and
  proposed that the Soviets be legalized, invested with
  government authority and given the right to suspend the
  operation of National Assembly decisions pending a popular
  referendum.

    

      That proposal indicates the complete ideological bankruptcy of
      the theorists who defend democracy and failed to see its
      bourgeois character.  This ludicrous attempt to combine the
      Soviet system, i.e., proletarian dictatorship, with the National
      Assembly, i.e. bourgeois dictatorship, utterly exposes the
      paucity of thought of the yellow Socialists and
      Social-Democrats, their 
      reactionary  petty-bourgeois political outlook, and their
      cowardly concessions to the irresistible growing strength of the
      new, proletarian democracy.

    

      22.  From a class standpoint, the Berne yellow International
  majority, which did not dare to adopt a formal resolution
  out of fear of the mass of workers, was right in condemning
  Bolshevism.  This majority is in full agreement with the
  Russian Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the
  Sheidemanns in Germany.  In complaining of persecution by
  the Bolsheviks, the Russian Mensheviks and Socialist
  revolutionaries try to conceal the fact that they are
  persecuted for participating in the Civil War on the side
  of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat.  Similarly, the
  Sheidemanns and their party have already demonstrated in
  Germany that they, too, are participating in the Civil War
  on the side of the bourgeoisie against the workers.

    

      It is therefore quite natural that the Berne yellow
      International majority should be in favor of condemning the
      Bolsheviks.  This was not an expression of defense of “pure
      democracy", but of the self defense of people who know and feel
      that in the Civil War they stand with the bourgeoisie against
      the proletariat.

    

      That is why, from the class point of view, the decision of the
      yellow International majority must be considered correct.  The
      proletariat must not fear the truth, it must face it squarely
      and draw all the necessary political conclusions.

    

      Comrades, I would like to add a word or two to the last two
      points.  I think that the comrades who are to report to us on
      the burn Conference will deal with it in greater detail.

    

      Not a word was said at the Berne Conference about the
      significance of Soviet power.  We in Russia have been discussing
      this question for two years now.  At our Party Conference in
      April 1917, we raised the following question, theoretically and
      politically: “What is Soviet power, what is its substance and
      what is its historical significance?”  We have been discussing
      it for almost two years.  And at our [Seventh] Party Congress we adopted a
      resolution on it. 


      On February 11 the Berlin Die Freiheit  published an
      appeal to the German proletariat signed not only by the leaders
      of the Independent
      Social Democratic Party of Germany, but also by all members
      of the Independent Social Democratic group in the Reichstag.
      In August 1918, Kautsky,
      one of the leading theorists of these Independents, wrote a
      pamphlet entitled  The Dictatorship of the Proletariat,
       in which he declared that he was a supporter of democracy
       and  of Soviet bodies, but that the Soviets must be
      bodies merely of an economic character and that they must not by
      any means be recognized as state organizations.  Kautsky says
      the same thing in Die Freiheit  of November 11 and
      January 12.  On February 9, an article appeared by Rudolf
      Hilferding, who is also regarded as one of the leading and
      authoritative theorists of the Second International, in which he
      proposed that the Soviet system be united with the National
      Assembly juridically, by state legislation.  That was on
      February 9.  On February 11 this proposal was adopted by the
      whole of the Independent Party and published in the form of an
      appeal.

    

      There is vacillation again, despite the fact that the National
      Assembly already exists, even after “pure democracy” has been
      embodied in reality, after the leading theorists of the
      Independent Social Democratic Party have declared that the
      Soviet organizations must not be state organizations!  This
      proves that these gentlemen really understand nothing about the
      new movement and about its conditions of struggle.  But it goes
      to prove something else, namely, that there must be conditions,
      causes, for this vacillation!  When, after all these events,
      after nearly two years of victorious revolution in Russia, we
      are offered resolutions like those adopted at the Berne
      Conference, which say nothing about the Soviets and their
      significance, about which not a single delegate uttered a single
      word, we have a perfect right to say that all these gentlemen
      are dead to us as Socialists and theorists.

    

      However, comrades, from the practical side, from the political
      point of view, the fact that these Independents, who in theory
      and on principle have been opposed to these state organizations,
      suddenly making the stupid proposal to “peacefully” unite the
      National Assembly with the Soviet system, i.e., to unite the
      dictatorship of the bourgeoisie with the dictatorship of the
      proletariat, shows that a great change is taking place among the
      masses.  We see that the Independents are all bankrupt in the
      Socialist and theoretical sense and that an enormous change is
      taking place among the masses.  The backward masses among the
      German workers are coming to us, have come to us!  So, the
      significance of the Independent Social Democratic Party of
      Germany, the best section of the Berne Conference, is nil from
      the theoretical and Socialist standpoint.  Still, it has some
      significance, which is that these waverers serve as an index to
      us of the mood of the backward sections of the proletariat.
      This, in my opinion, is a great historical significance of this
      Conference.  We experienced something of the kind in our own
      revolution.  Our Mensheviks traversed almost exactly the same
      path as that of the theorists of the Independents in Germany.
      At first, when they had a majority in the Soviets, they were in
      favor of the Soviets.  All we heard then was: “Long live the
      Soviets!", “For the Soviets!", “The Soviets are revolutionary
      democracy!”  When, however, we Bolsheviks secured a majority in
      the Soviets, they changed their tune; they said: the Soviets
      must not exist side-by-side with the Constituent Assembly.  And
      various Mensheviks theorists made practically the same
      proposals, like the one to unite the Soviet system with the
      Constituent Assembly and to incorporate the Soviets into the
      state structure.  Once again it is here revealed that the
      general course of the proletarian revolution is the same
      throughout the world.  First the spontaneous formation of
      Soviets, then their spread and development, and then the
      appearance of the practical problem: Soviets, or National
      Assembly, or Constituent Assembly, or the bourgeois
      parliamentary system; utter confusion among the leaders, and
      finally—the proletarian revolution.  But I think we
      should not present the problem in this way after nearly two
      years of revolution; we should rather adopt concrete decisions
      because for us, and particularly for the majority of the West
      European countries, spreading of the Soviet system is a most
      important task.

    

      I would like to quote here just one Mensheviks resolution.  I
      asked Comrade Obolensky to translate it into German.  He
      promised to do so but, unfortunately, he is not here.  I shall
      try to render it from memory, as I have not the full text of it
      with me.

    

      It is very difficult for a foreigner who has not heard anything
      about Bolshevism to arrive at an independent opinion about our
      controversial questions.  Everything the Bolsheviks assert is
      challenged by the Mensheviks, and vice versa.  Of course, it
      cannot be otherwise in the middle of the struggle, and that is
      why it is so important that the last Menshevik Party conference,
      held in December 1918, adopted the long and detailed resolution
      published in full in the Menshevik Gazeta
      Pechatnikov .  In this resolution the Mensheviks themselves
      briefly outline the history of the class struggle and of the
      Civil War.  The resolution states that they condemn those groups
      in their Party which rallied with the propertied classes in the
      Urals, in the South, in the Crimea and in Georgia—all
      these regions are enumerated.  Those groups of the Menshevik
      party which, in alliance with the propertied classes, fought
      against the Soviets are now condemned in the resolution; but the
      last point of the resolution also condemns those who joined the
      Communists.  It follows that the Mensheviks were compelled to
      admit that there was no unity in their party, and that its
      members were either on the side of the bourgeoisie or on the
      side of the proletariat.  The majority of the Mensheviks went
      over to the bourgeoisie and fought against us during the Civil
      War.  We, of course, persecute Mensheviks, we even shoot them,
      when they wage war against us, fight against our Red Army and
      shoot our Red commanders.  We responded to the bourgeois war
      with the proletarian war—there can be no other way.
      Therefore, from the political point of view, all this is sheer
      Menshevik hypocrisy.  Historically, it is incomprehensible how
      people who have not been officially certified as mad could talk
      at the Berne Conference, on the instructions of the Mensheviks
      and Socialist-Revolutionaries, about the Bolsheviks fighting the
      latter, yet keep silent about their own struggle, in alliance
      with the bourgeoisie, against the proletariat.

    

      All of them furiously attack us for persecuting them.  This is
      true.  But they do not say a word about the part they themselves
      have taken in the Civil War!  I think that I shall have to
      provide the full text of the resolution to be recorded in the
      minutes, and I shall ask the foreign comrades to study it
      because it is a historical document in which the issue is raised
      correctly and which provides excellent material for appraising
      the controversy between the “socialist” trends in Russia.  In
      between the proletariat and bourgeoisie there is another class
      of people, who incline first this way and then the other.  This
      has always been the case in all revolutions, and it is
      absolutely impossible in capitalist society, in which the
      proletariat and bourgeoisie formed to hostile camps, for
      intermediary sections not to exist between them.  The existence
      of these waverers is historically inevitable, and,
      unfortunately, these elements, who do not know themselves on
      whose side they will fight tomorrow, will exist for quite some
      time.

    

      I want to make the practical proposal that a resolution be
      adopted in the which three points shall be specifically
      mentioned.

    

 First:  one of the most important tasks confronting
      the West European comrades is to explain to the people the
      meaning, importance and necessity of the Soviet system.  There
      is a sort of misunderstanding on this question.  Although
      Kautsky and Hilferding are bankrupt as theorists, their recent
      articles in Die Freiheit  show that they correctly
      reflect the mood of the backward sections of the German
      proletariat.  The same thing took place in our country: during
      the first eight months of the Russian Revolution the question of
      the Soviet organization was very much discussed, and the workers
      did not understand what the new system was and whether the
      Soviets could be transformed into a state machine.  In our
      revolution we advanced along the path of practice, and not of
      theory.  For example, formally we did not raise the question of
      the Constituent Assembly from the theoretical side, and we did
      not say we did not recognize the Constituent Assembly.  It was
      only later, when the Soviet organizations had spread throughout
      the country and had captured political power, that we decided to
      dissolve the Constituent Assembly.  Now we see that in Hungary
      and Switzerland the question is much more acute.  On the one
      hand, this is very good: it gives us the firm conviction that in
      the West European states the revolution is advancing more
      quickly and will yield great victories.  On the other hand, a
      danger is concealed in it, namely, that the struggle will be so
      precipitous that the minds of the mass of workers will not keep
      pace with this development.  Even now the significance of the
      Soviet system is not clear to a large mass on the politically
      educated German workers, because they have been trained in the
      spirit of the parliamentary system and ingrained with  bourgeois prejudices.

    

 Second:  About the spread of the Soviet system.  When
      we hear how quickly the idea of Soviets is spreading in Germany,
      and even in Britain, it is very important evidence that the
      proletarian revolution will be victorious.  Its progress can
      only be retarded for a short time.  It is quite another thing,
      however, when Comrades Albert and Platten tell us that in the
      rural districts in their countries there are hardly any Soviets
      among the farm laborers and small peasants.  In Die
      Rote Fahne I read in article opposing peasant Soviets, but
      quite properly supporting Soviets of farm laborers and of poor
      peasants.  [C] The bourgeoisie and their lackeys, like
      Sheidemann and company, have already issued the slogan of
      peasant Soviets.  All we need, however, is Soviets of farm
      laborers and poor peasants.  Unfortunately, from the reports of
      Comrades Albert, Platten and others, we see that, with the
      exception of Hungary, very little is being done to spread the
      Soviet system in the countryside.  In this, perhaps, lies the
      real and quite serious danger threatening the achievement of
      certain victory by the German proletariat.  Victory can only be
      considered assured when not only the German workers, but also
      the rural proletarians are organized, and organized not as
      before—in trade unions and cooperative societies —
      but in Soviets.  Our victory was made much easier by the fact
      that in  October
      1917  we marched with the peasants, with all the peasants.
      In that sense, our revolution at that time was a bourgeois
      revolution.  The first step taken by our proletarian government
      was to embody in a law promulgated on October 26 (old-style),
      1917, on the next day after the revolution, the old demands of
      all the peasants which peasant Soviets and village assemblies
      had put forward under Kerensky.  That is where our strength lay;
      that is why we were able to win the overwhelming majority so
      easily.  As far as the countryside was concerned, our revolution
      continued to be a bourgeois revolution, and only later, after a
      lapse of six months, were we compelled within the framework of
      the state organization to start the class struggle in the
      countryside, to establish Committees of Poor Peasants, of
      semi-proletarians, in every village, and to carry on a
      methodical fight against the rural bourgeoisie.  This was
      inevitable in Russia owing to the backwardness of the country.
      In Western Europe things will proceed differently, and that is
      why we must emphasize the absolute necessity of spreading the
      Soviet system also to the rural population in proper, perhaps
      new, forms.

      
    

 Third:  we must say that winning a Communist majority
      in the Soviets is the principal task in all countries in which
      Soviet government is not yet victorious.  Our Resolutions’
      Commission discussed this question yesterday.  Perhaps other
      comrades will express their opinion on it; but I would like to
      propose that these three points be adopted as a special
      resolution.  Of course, we are not in a position to prescribe
      the path of development.  It is quite likely that the revolution
      will come very soon in many West-European countries, but we, as
      the organized section of the working-class, as a party, strive
      and must strive to gain majority in the Soviets.  Then our
      victory will be assured and no power on Earth will be able to do
      anything against the Communist revolution.  If we do not,
      victory will not be secured so easily, and it will not be
      durable.  And so, I would like to propose that these three
      points be adopted as a special resolution.

      Resolution to the Thesis on Bourgeois Democracy and the
      Dictatorship of the Proletarian
    

      On the basis of these thesis and the reports made by the
      delegates from the different countries, the Congress of the
      Communist International declares that the chief task of the
      Communist Parties in all countries where Soviet government has
      not yet been established, is as follows: 

    

      1) to explain to the broad mass of the workers the historic
         significance and the political and historical necessity of
         the new, proletarian, democracy which must replace bourgeois
         democracy and the parliamentary system;

    

      2) to extend the organization of Soviets among the workers in
         all branches of industry, among the soldiers in the Army and
         the sailors in the Navy and also among farm laborers and poor
         peasants;

    

      3) to build a stable Communist majority inside the Soviets.

      Concluding Speech at the Closing Session of the Congress
      March 6
    
 

      That we have been able to gather, despite all the persecution
      and all the difficulties created by the police, that we have
      been able without any serious differences and in a brief space
      of time, reach important decisions on all the vitally urgent
      questions of the contemporary revolutionary epoch, we owe to the
      fact that the proletarian masses of the whole world, by their
      action, have brought up these questions in practice and begun to
      tackle them.

    

      All we have had to do here has been to record the gains already
      won by the people in the process of their revolutionary
      struggle.

    

      Not only in the East European but also in the West European
      countries, not only in the vanquished but also in the victor
      countries, for example in Britain, the movement in favor of
      Soviets is spreading farther and farther, and this movement is,
      most assuredly, a movement pursuing the aim of establishing the
      new, proletarian democracy.  It is the most significant step
      towards the dictatorship of the proletariat to, towards the
      complete victory of communism.

    

      No matter how the bourgeoisie of the whole world rage, how much
      they deport or jail or even kill 
      Spartacists  and Bolsheviks—all this will no longer
      help.  It will only serve to enlighten the masses, help rid them
      of the old bourgeois-democratic prejudices and steel them in the
      struggle.  The victory of the proletarian revolution on a world
      scale is assured.  The founding of an international Soviet
      republic is on the way.  ( Stormy Applause.  )

      Most probably, it is not the Birmingham Workers’ Counsel that is
      meant here, but the 
      shop stewards committee .  It is very likely that the
      newspaper which Lenin read contained incorrect information.
      Speaking at the First Congress of the Communist International on
      March 3, 1919, J. Fineberg, a delegate from the British
      Communist group, said:

    

      “In industrial areas local workers’ committees were formed,
      including representatives of the shop stewards committees, for
      instance, the Clyde workers’ committee, London and Sheffield
      workers’ committees and so on.  The committees served as
      organizational centers and representatives of organized labor
      and localities.  For some time the employers in the government
      refused to recognize the shop stewards committees, but in the
      end they had to enter into negotiations with these unregistered
      committees.  That Lloyd George agreed to recognize the
      Birmingham committee as an economic organization proves the shop
      stewards committees had become permanent factors in the British
      movement.  In the shop stewards committees, workers’ committees
      and national conferences of shop stewards committees we have an
      organization similar to the one forming the basis of the Soviet
      republic"

[1] This
      Congress of the R.C.P.(B.), held in Moscow, was attended by 301 delegates
      with the right to vote who represented 313,766 Party members and 102
      delegates with voice but no vote. Lenin opened the Congress with a short
      speech. The Congress agenda was: report of the Central Committee, the
      Programme of the R.C.P.(B.), the foundation of the Communist
      International, the war situation and war policy, work in the countryside,
      organisational problems, and other business.
Lenin delivered the report of the Central Committee and
      also reported on the Party Programme and work in the countryside.
In a resolution on the report of the Central Committee
      the Congress expressed its full “approval of the political
      activities of the Central Committee”.
In the sphere of military affairs the Congress adopted a
      decision to strengthen the regular Red Army, lead by Trotsky, and
      inculcate iron discipline, stressing especially the role of the
      proletarian hard core of the army and the role of the commissars and Party
      cells in the political and military training of the Red Army. The Congress
      pointed to the need, developed by Trotsky with Lenin’s support, to
      employ old army specialists and to make use of the highest achievements of
      the bourgeois art of war. The Congress vehemently rejected the proposal
      from the group known as the “army opposition” that was against
      the formation of a regular Red Army and defended the survivals of the
      guerrilla spirit in the army.
The Congress adopted a decision on Party and Soviet
      organisation and defeated the opportunist group headed by Sapronov and
      Osinsky who denied the leading role of the Party in the Soviets.
Owing to the large influx of new members into the Party
      the Congress decided to carry out the re-registration of the entire
      membership and to improve the Party’s social composition.
Among the members of the Central Committee elected by the
      Congress were Lenin, Dzerzhinsky, Kalinin and Stasova; among the
      alternative members were Artyom (Sergeyev), Vladimirsky and
      Yaroslavsky.

Koichak’s victories on the Eastern Front are creating an extremely grave danger for the Soviet Republic. Our efforts must be exerted to the utmost to smash Kolchak.
The Central Committee therefore instructs all Party organisations to concentrate their efforts first and foremost on the following measures, which must be carried out by the Party organisations and, in particular, by the trade unions in order to enlist wider sections of the working class in the active defence of the country.
1. Support In every way the mobilisation ordered on April 11, 1919.
All the forces of the Party and the trade unions must be mobilised immediately so as to render, within the next few days, without the slightest delay, the most energetic assistance to the mobilisation decreed by the Council of People’s Commissars on April 10, 1919.
The mobilised men must at once be made to see the active participation of the trade unions and to feel that they have the support of the working class.
In particular, it must be made clear to every mobilised man that his immediate departure for the front will mean an improvement in his food situation; firstly, because of the better ration received by the soldiers in the grain-producing front-line zone; secondly, because of the fact that the food brought into the hungry gubernias will be distributed among fewer people; thirdly, because of the widely organised dispatch of food parcels by Red Army men in the front areas to their families at home.
The Central Committee demands of every Party and trade union organisation a weekly report, however brief, on what has been done to help mobilisation and the mobilised.
2. In the areas near the front, especially in the Voigaside region, trade union members must be armed to a man, and in the event of a shortage of arms, they must all be mobilised to render every possible aid to the Red Army, to replace casualties, etc.
Such towns as Pokrovsk, where the trade unions themselves decided to mobilise immediately 50 per cent of their members, should serve us as an example. The metropolitan cities and the large industrial centres must not lag behind Pokrovsk.
The trade unions everywhere must, using their own forces and means, carry out a check registration of their members in order that all who are not absolutely indispensable at home may be sent to fight for the Volga and the Urals territory.
3. The most serious attention must be given to intensifying agitational work, especially among those to be mobilised, those already mobilised and Red Army men. The usual methods of agitation—lectures, meetings, etc.—are not enough; agitation should be carried on among Red Army men by workers, singly or in groups; such groups of ordinary workers, members of trade unions, should be appointed specifically to barracks, Red Army units and factories. The trade unions must institute a check to see that every one of their members takes part in house-to-house agitation, distribution of leaflets and personal talks.
4. All male office workers are to be replaced by women, for which purpose a new registration, both Party and trade union, shall be carried out.
Special cards shall be introduced for all trade union members and all office workers, indicating the part they are personally taking in assisting the Red Army.
5. Aid Bureaus or Committees of Action, local and central, are to be instituted immediately through the trade unions, factory committees, Party organisations, co-operative societies, etc. Their addresses shall be published. The public shall be informed of them in the widest possible manner. Every man liable to mobilisation, every Red Army man, and every person desirous of leaving for the South, for the Don or the Ukraine for food supply work should know that there is an aid bureau or a committee of action nearby; that it is accessible to every worker and peasant and he can obtain advice or instruction there, that contact with the army authorities will he facilitated for him, etc.
It shall be the special task of these bureaus to help to equip the Red Army. We can greatly increase the strength of our army if we improve the supply of arms, clothing, etc. And among the population there are still considerable quantities of arms which have been hidden or are not being used for the army. There are still considerable factory stocks of goods of various kinds needed by the army, and they must be quickly found and dispatched to the army. The army organisations in charge of supplies should be given immediate, broad and effective assistance by the general public. Every effort must be devoted to this matter.
6, The trade unions must organise the extensive enlistment of peasants, especially of peasant youths in the non-agricultural gubernias, for the ranks of the Red Army, for the formation of food detachments and for the food army in the Don and the Ukraine.
This activity can and should be expanded to many times Its present volume; it helps both to assist the hungry population of the metropolitan cities and the non-agricultural gubernias and to strengthen the Red Army.
7. As regards the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Party line in the present situation is to imprison those who assist Koichak, whether deliberately or unwittingly. In our republic of working people we shall not tolerate anybody who does not help us by deeds in the fight against Kolchak. Among the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries there are people who are willing to render such help. These people should be encouraged and given practical jobs, principally in the way of technical assistance to the Red Army in the rear, and their work must be strictly supervised.
The Central Committee appeals to all Party organisations and all trade unions to set to work in a revolutionary way, and not confine themselves to the old stereotyped methods.
We can defeat Koichak. We can gain an early and final victory, because our victories in the South and the international situation, which is daily improving and changing in our favour, guarantee our ultimate triumph.
We must exert every effort, display revolutionary energy, and Koichak will be rapidly defeated. The Volga, the Urals and Siberia can and must be defended and regained.

## Greetings to the Hungarian Workers












Greetings to the Hungarian Workers



V. I. Lenin
Greetings to the Hungarian Workers


Written: 27 May, 1919
First Published: Pravda No. 115, May 29, 1919; Published  according to the manuscript 
Source: Lenin’s Collected Works, 4th English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1972 Volume 29, pages 387-391

  Comrades, the news we have been receiving from the Hungarian Soviet leaders fills us with enthusiasm and pleasure. Soviet government has been in existence in Hungary for only a little over two months, yet as regards organisation the Hungarian proletariat already seems to have excelled us. That is understandable, for in Hungary the general cultural level of the population is higher; further more, the proportion of industrial workers to the total population is immeasurably greater (in Budapest there are three million of the eight million population of present-day Hungary), and, lastly, in Hungary the transition to the Soviet system, to the dictatorship of the proletariat, has been incomparably easier and more peaceful.
  This last circumstance is particularly important. The majority of the European socialist leaders, of both the social-chauvinist and Kautskyite trends, have become so much a prey to purely philistine prejudices, fostered by decades of relatively “peaceful” capitalism and the bourgeois parliamentary system, that they are unable to understand that Soviet power and the dictatorship of the proletariat mean. The proletariat cannot perform its epoch-making liberating mission unless it removes these leaders from its path, unless it sweeps them out of its way. These people believed, or half-believed, the bourgeois lies about Soviet power in Russia and were unable to distinguish the nature of the new, proletarian democracy—democracy for the working people, socialist democracy, as embodied in Soviet government—from bourgeois democracy, which they slavishly worship and call “pure democracy” or “democracy” in general.
 These blind people, fettered by bourgeois prejudices, failed to understand the epoch-making change from bourgeois to proletarian democracy, from bourgeois to proletarian dictatorship. They confused certain specific features of Russian Soviet government, of the history of its development in Russia, with Soviet government as an international phenomenon.
  The Hungarian proletarian revolution is helping even the blind to see. The form of transition to the dictatorship of the proletariat in Hungary is altogether different from that in Russia—voluntary resignation of the bourgeois government, instantaneous restoration of working-class unity, socialist unity on a communist programme. The nature of Soviet power is now all the clearer; the only form of rule which has the support of the working people and of the proletariat at their head that is now possible anywhere in the world is Soviet rule, the dictatorship of the proletariat.
  This dictatorship presupposes the ruthlessly severe, swift and resolute use of force to crush the resistance of the exploiters, the capitalists, landowners and their underlings. Whoever does not understand this is not a revolutionary, and must be removed from the post of leader or adviser of the proletariat.
  But the essence of proletarian dictatorship is not in force alone, or even mainly in force. Its chief feature is the organisation and discipline of the advanced contingent of the working people, of their vanguard; of their sole leader, the proletariat, whose object is to build socialism, abolish the division of society into classes, make all members of society working people, and remove the basis for all exploitation of man by man. This object cannot be achieved at one stroke. It requires a fairly long period of transition from capitalism to socialism, because the reorganisation of production is a difficult matter, because radical changes in all spheres of life need time, and because the enormous force of habit of running things in a petty-bourgeois and bourgeois way can only be overcome by a long and stubborn struggle. That is why Marx spoke of an entire period of the dictatorship of the proletariat as the period of transition from capitalism to socialism.[1] 
 Throughout the whole of this transition period, resistance to the revolution will be offered both by the capitalists and by their numerous myrmidons among the bourgeois intellectuals, who will resist consciously, and by the vast mass of the working people, including the peasants, who are shackled very much by petty-bourgeois habits and traditions, and who all too often will resist unconsciously. Vacillations among these groups are inevitable. As a working man the peasant gravitates towards socialism, and prefers the dictatorship of the workers to the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. As a seller of grain, the peasant gravitates towards the bourgeoisie, towards freedom of trade, i.e., back to the “habitual”, old, “time-hallowed” capitalism.
  What is needed to enable the proletariat to lead the peasants and the petty-bourgeois groups in general is the dictatorship of the proletariat, the rule of one class, its strength of organisation and discipline, its centralised power based on all the achievements of the culture, science and technology of capitalism, its proletarian affinity to the mentality of every working man, its prestige with the disunited, less developed working people in the countryside or in petty industry, who are less firm in politics. Here phrase-mongering about “democracy” in general, about “unity” or the “unity of labour democracy”, about the “equality” of all “men of labour”, and so on and so forth—the phrase-mongering for which the now petty-bourgeois social-chauvinists and Kautskyites have such a predilection—is of no use whatever. Phrase-mongering only throws dust in the eyes, blinds the mind and strengthens the old stupidity, conservatism, and routine of capitalism, the parliamentary system and bourgeois democracy.
  The abolition of classes requires a long, difficult and stubborn class struggle, which, after the overthrow of capitalist rule, after the destruction of the bourgeois state, after the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat, does not disappear (as the vulgar representatives of the old socialism and the old Social-Democracy imagine), but merely changes its forms and in many respects becomes fiercer.
  The proletariat, by means of a class struggle against the resistance of the bourgeoisie, against the conservatism, routine, irresolution and vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie, must uphold its power, strengthen its organising influence, “neutralise” those groups which fear to leave the bourgeoisie and which follow the proletariat too hesitantly, and consolidate the new discipline, the comradely discipline of the working people, their firm bond with the proletariat, their unity with the proletariat—that new discipline, that new basis of social ties in place of the serf discipline of the Middle Ages and the discipline of starvation, the discipline of “free” wage-slavery under capitalism.
  In order to abolish classes a period of the dictatorship of one class is needed, the dictatorship of precisely that oppressed class which is capable not only of overthrowing the exploiters, not only of ruthlessly crushing their resistance, but also of breaking ideologically with the entire bourgeois-democratic outlook, with all the philistine phrase-mongering about liberty and equality in general (in reality, this phrase-mongering implies, as Marx demonstrated long ago, the “liberty and equality” of commodity owners, the “liberty and equality” of the capitalist and the worker ).
  More, classes can be abolished only by the dictatorship of that oppressed class which has been schooled, united, trained and steeled by decades of the strike and political struggle against capital—of that class alone which has assimilated all the urban, industrial, big-capitalist culture and has the determination and ability to protect it and to preserve and further develop all its achievements, and make them available to all the people, to all the working people—of that class alone which will be able to bear all the hardships, trials, privations and great sacrifices which history inevitably imposes upon those who break with the past and boldly hew a road for themselves to a new future—of that class alone whose finest members are full of hatred and contempt for everything petty-bourgeois and philistine, for the qualities that flourish so profusely among the petty bourgeoisie, the minor employees and the “intellectuals”—of that class alone which “has been through the hardening school of labour” and is able to inspire respect for its efficiency in every working person and every honest man.
  Hungarian workers! Comrades! You have set the world an even better example than Soviet Russia by your ability to unite all socialists at one stroke on the platform of genuine  proletarian dictatorship. You are now faced with the most gratifying and most difficult task of holding your own in a rigorous war against the Entente. Be firm. Should vacillation manifest itself among the socialists who yesterday gave their support to you, to the dictatorship of the proletariat, or among the petty bourgeoisie, suppress it ruthlessly. In war the coward’s legitimate fate is the bullet.
  You are waging the only legitimate, just and truly
    revolutionary war, a war of the oppressed against the oppressors,
    a war of the working people against the exploiters, a war for the
    victory of socialism. All honest members of the working class all
    over the world are on your side. Every month brings the world
    proletarian revolution nearer.
Be firm! Victory will be yours!
Lenin

## A Great Beginning: Heroism Of The Workers In The Rear











A Great Beginning Heroism Of The Workers In The Rear ”Communist subbotniks”



V. I. Lenin
A Great Beginning
Heroism Of The Workers In The Rear
“Communist subbotniks”


Written: 28 June, 1919
First Published: July 1919 as a separate pamphlet in Moscow; Signed: N. Lenin; Published according to the manuscript
Source: Lenin’s Collected Works, 4th English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1972 Volume 29, pages 409-434

 The press reports many instances of the heroism of
    the Red Army men. In the fight against Kolchak, Denikin and other
    forces of the landowners and capitalists, the workers and peasants
    very often display miracles of bravery and endurance, defending
    the gains of the socialist revolution. The guerrilla spirit,
    weariness and indiscipline are being overcome; it is a slow and
    difficult process, but it is making headway in spite of
    everything. The heroism of the working people making voluntary
    sacrifices for the victory of socialism—this is the
    foundation of the new, comradely discipline in the Red Army, the
    foundation on which that army is regenerating, gaining strength
    and growing. 
 
      The heroism of the workers in the rear is no less worthy of
      attention. In this connection, the communist
      subbotniks organised by the workers on their own
      initiative are really of enormous significance. Evidently, this
      is only a beginning, but it is a beginning of exceptionally
      great importance. It is the beginning of a revolution that is
      more difficult, more tangible, more radical and more decisive
      than the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, for it is a victory over
      our own conservatism, indiscipline, petty-bourgeois egoism, a
      victory over the habits left as a heritage to the worker and
      peasant by accursed capitalism. Only when this victory
      is consolidated will the new social discipline, socialist
      discipline, be created; then and only then will a reversion to
      capitalism become impossible, will communism become really
      invincible. 

Pravda in its issue of May 17 published an article by
      A. J. entitled: “Work in a Revolutionary Way. A
      Communist Saturday ”. This article is so important
      that we reproduce it here in full.
    

      “Work In A Revolutionary Way 
      “A Communist Saturday
“The letter of the Russian Communist
      Party’s Central Committee on working in a revolutionary
way was a powerful stimulus to communist organisations and to
      Communists. The general wave of enthusiasm carried many communist
      railway workers to the front, but the majority of them could not
      leave their responsible posts or find new forms of working in a
      revo1utionary way. Reports from the localities about the tardiness
      with which the work of mobilisation was proceeding and the
      prevalence of red tape compelled the Moscow-Kazan Railway district
      to turn its attention to the way the railway was functioning. It
      turned out that, owing to the shortage of labour and low
      productivity of labour, urgent orders and repairs to locomotives
      were being held up. At a general meeting of Communists and
      sympathisers of the Moscow-Kazan Railway district held on May 7,
      the question was raised of passing from words to deeds in helping
      to achieve victory over Kolchak. The following resolution was
      moved: 
    
“’In view of the grave domestic and
    foreign situation, Communists and sympathisers, in order to gain
    the upper hand over the class enemy must spur themselves on again
    and deduct an extra hour from their rest, i.e., lengthen their
    working day by one hour, accumulate these extra hours and put in
    six extra hours of manual labour on Saturday for the purpose of
    creating real values of immediate worth. Since Communists must not
    grudge their health and life for the gains of the revolution, this
    work should be performed without pay. Communist Saturdays
    are to be introduced throughout the district and to continue until
    complete victory over Kolchak has been achieved.’ 
    
“After some hesitation, the resolution was
    adopted unanimously. 
    
“On Saturday, May 10, at 6 p.m., the
    Communists and sympathisers turned up to work like soldiers,
    formed ranks, and without fuss or bustle were taken by the foremen
    to the various jobs. 
    
“The results of working in in a
    revolutionary way are evident. The accompanying table gives
    the place, of work and the character of the work performed.

    4 locomotives and 16 carriages turned out and 9,300 poods unloaded and loaded 

“The total value of the work performed at
      ordinary rates of pay is five million rubles; calculated at
      overtimes rate it would be fifty per cent higher.

    
“The productivity of labour in loading
      wagons was 270 per cent higher than that of regular workers, The
      productivity of labour on other jobs was approximately the
      same. 
“Jobs (urgent) were done which had been held up for periods ranging from seven days to three months owing to the shortage of labour and to red tape. 
    
“The work was done in spite of the state of disrepair (easily remedied) of implements, as a result of which certain groups were held up from thirty to forty minutes. 
    
“The administration left in charge of the work could hardly keep pace with the men in finding new jobs for them, and perhaps it was only a slight exaggeration when an old foreman said that as much work was done at this communist Saturday as would have been done in a week by non-class-conscious and slack workers. 
    
“In view of the fact that many non-Communists, sincere supporters of the Soviet government, took part in the work, and that many more are expected on future Saturdays, and also in view of the fact that many other districts desire to follow the example of the communist railway workers of the Moscow-Kazan Railway, I shall deal in greater detail with the organisational side of the matter as seen from reports received from the localities. 
    
“Of those taking part in the work some ten per cent were Communists permanently employed in the localities. The rest were persons occupying responsible and elective posts, from the commissar of the railway to commissars of individual enterprises, representatives of the trade union, and employees of the head office and of the Commissariat of Railways. 
    
“The enthusiasm and team spirit displayed during work were extraordinary. When the workers, clerks and head office employees without even an oath or argument, caught hold of the forty-pood wheel tire of a passenger locomotive and, like industrious ants, rolled it into place, one’s heart was filled with fervent joy at the sight of this collective effort, and one’s conviction was strengthened that the victory of the working class was unshakable. The international bandits will not crush the victorious workers; the internal saboteurs will not live to see Kolchak. 
    
“When the work was finished those present witnessed an unprecedented scene: a hundred Communists, weary, but with the light of joy in their eyes, greeted their success with the solemn strains of the Internationale. And it seemed as if the triumphant strains of the triumphant anthem would sweep over the walls through the whole of working-class Moscow and that like the waves caused by a stone thrown into a pool they would spread through the whole of working-class Russia and shake up the weary and the slack.
    
”A. J.” 
    
Appraising this remarkable “example worthy of emulation”, Comrade N. R. in an article in Pravda of May 20 under that heading, wrote: 
“Cases of Communists working like this are not rare. I know of similar cases at an electric power station, and on various railways On the Nikolayevskaya Railway, the Communists worked overtime several nights to lift a locomotive that had fallen into the turn-table pit. In the winter, all the Communists and sympathisers on the Northern Railway worked several Sundays clearing the track of snow; and the communist cells at many goods stations patrol the stations at night to prevent stealing. But all this work was casual and unsystematic. The comrades on the Moscow-Kazan line are making this work systematic and permanent, and this is new. They say in their resolution, ’until complete victory over Kolchak has been achieved’, and therein lies the significance of their work. They are lengthening the working day of every Communist and sympathiser by one hour for the duration of the state of war; simultaneously, their productivity of labour is exemplary. 
    
“This example has called forth, and is bound to call forth, further emulation. A general meeting of the Communists and sympathisers on the Alexandrovskaya Railway, after discussing the military situation and the resolution adopted by the comrades on the Moscow-Kazan Railway, resolved: (1) to introduce ’subbotniks’ for the Communists and sympathisers on the Alexandrovskaya Railway, the first subbotnik to take place on May 17; (2) to organise the Communists and sympathisers in exemplary, model teams which must show the workers how to work and what can really be done with the present materials and tools, and in the present food situation. 
    
“The Moscow-Kazan comrades say that their example has made a great impression and that they expect a large number of non-Party workers to turn up next Saturday. At the time these lines are being written the Communists have not yet started working overtime in the Alexandrovskaya Railway workshops, but as soon as the rumour spread that they were to do so the mass of non-Party workers stirred themselves. ’We did not know yesterday, otherwise we would have worked as well!’ ’I will certainly come next Saturday,’ can be heard on all sides. The impression created by work of this sort is very great. 
    
“The example set by the Moscow-Kazan comrades should be emulated by all the communist cells in the rear; not only the communist cells at Moscow Junction, but the whole Party organisation in Russia. In the rural districts too, the communist cells should in the first place set to work to till the fields of Red Army men and thus help their families. 
    
“The comrades on the Moscow-Kazan line finished their first communist subbotnik by singing the Internationale. If the communist organisations throughout Russia follow this example and consistently apply it, the Russian Soviet Republic will successfully weather the coming severe months to the mighty strains of the Internationale sung by all the working people of the Republic. . . . 
    
“To work, communist comrades!” 
    
On May 23, 1919, Pravda reported the following:
“The first communist ’subbotnik’ on the Alexandrovskaya Railway took place on May 17. In accordance with the resolution adopted by their general meeting, ninety-eight Communists and sympathisers worked five hours overtime without pay, receiving in return only the right to purchase a second dinner, and, as manual labourers, half a pound of bread to go with their dinner.” 
    
 
 Although the work was poorly prepared and organised the productivity of labour was nevertheless from two to three times higher than usual. 
 
 Here are a few examples. 
 
 Five turners turned eighty spindles in four hours. The productivity is 213 per cent of the usual level. 
 
 Twenty unskilled workers in four hours collected scrap materials of a total weight of 600 poods, and seventy laminated carriage springs, each weighing 31 1/2 poods, making a total of 850 poods. Productivity, 300 per cent of the usual level. 
“The comrades explain this by the fact that ordinarily their work is boring and tiresome, whereas here they worked with a will and with enthusiasm. Now, however, they will be ashamed to turn out less in regular working hours than they did at the communist subbotnik.” 
    
“Now many non-Party workers say that they would like to take part in the subbotniks. The locomotive crews volunteer to take locomotives from the ’cemetery’, during a subbotnik, repair them and set them going. 
    
“It is reported that similar subbotniks are to be organised on the Vyazma line.”

 
      How the work is done at these communist subbotniks is
      described by Comrade A. Dyachenko in an article in
      Pravda of June 7, entitled “Notes of a
      subbotnik Worker”. We quote the main passages
      from this article.




“A comrade and I were very pleased to go
    and do our ’bit’ in the subbotnik arranged by
    a decision of the railway district committee of the Party; for a
    time, for a few hours, I would give my head a rest and my muscles
    a bit of exercise. . . . We were detailed off to the railway
    carpentry shop. We got there, found a number of our people
    exchanged greetings, engaged in banter for a bit, counted up our
    forces and found that there were thirty of us. . . . And in front
    of us lay a ’monster’, a steam boiler weighing no less
    than six or seven hundred poods; our job was to
    ’shift’ it, i.e., move it over a distance of a quarter
    or a third of a verst, to its base. We began to have our
    doubts. . . . However, we started on the job. Some comrades placed
    wooden rollers under the boiler, attached two ropes to it, and we
    began to tug away. . . . The boiler gave way reluctantly, but at
    length it budged. We were delighted. After all, there were so few
    of us. . . . For nearly two weeks this boiler had resisted the
    efforts of thrice our number of non-communist workers and nothing
    could make it budge until we tackled it. . . . We worked for an
    hour, strenuously, rhythmically to the command of our
    ’foreman’—’one, two, three’, and the
    boiler kept on rolling. Suddenly there was confusion, and a number
    of our comrades went tumbling on to the ground in the funniest
    fashion. The rope ’let them down’. . . . A
    moment’s delay, and a thicker rope was made
    fast. . . . Evening. It was gettine dark, but we had yet to
    negotiate a small hillock, and then our job would soon be
    done. Our arms ached, our palms burned, we were hot and pulled for
    all we were worth—and were making headway. The
    ’management’ stood round and somewhat shamed by our
    success, clutched at a rope. ’Lend a hand, it’s time
    you did!’ A Red Army man was watching our labours; in his
    hands he held an accordion. What was he thinking? Who were these
    people? Why should they work on Saturday when everybody was at
    home? I solved his riddle and said to him: ’Comrade, play us
    a jolly tune. We are not raw hands, we are real
    Communists. Don’t you see how fast the work is going under
    our hands? We are not lazy, we are pulling for all we are
    worth!’ In response, the Red Army man carefully put his
    accordion on the ground and hastened to grab at a rope end. . . . 
    
“Suddenly Comrade U. struck up the workers’ song ’Dubinushka’, ’anglichanin mudrets’, he sang, in an excellent tenor voice and we all joined in the refrain of this labour shanty: ’Eh, dubinushka, ukhnem, podyornem, podyornem. . . .’ 
    
“We were unaccustomed to the work, our muscles were weary, our shoulders, our backs ached . . . but the next day would be a free day, our day of rest, and we would be able to get all the sleep we wanted. The goal was near, and after a little hesitation our ’monster’ rolled almost right up to the base. ’Put some boards under, raise it on the base, and let the boiler do the work that has long been expected of it.’ We went off in a crowd to the ’club room’ of the local Party cell. The room was brightly lit; the walls decorated with posters; rifles stacked around the room. After lustily singing the Internationale we enjoyed a glass of tea and ’rum’, and even bread. This treat, given us by the local comrades, was very welcome after our arduous toil. We took a brotherly farewell of our comrades and lined up. The strains of revolutionary songs echoed through the slumbering streets in the silence of the night and our measured tread kept time with the music. We sang ’Comrades, the Bugles Are Sounding’, ’Arise Ye Starvelings from Your Slumbers’, songs of the International and of labour. 
    
“A week passed. Our arms and shoulders were back to normal and we were going to another ’subbotnik’, nine versts away this time, to repair railway waggons. Our destination was Perovo. The comrades climbed on the roof of an ’American’ box waggon and sang the Internationale well and with gusto. The people on the train listened to the singing, evidently in surprise. The wheels knocked a measured beat, and those of us who failed to get on to the roof clung to the steps pretending to be ’devil-may-care’ passengers. The train pulled in. We had reached our destination. We passed through a long yard and were warmly greeted by the commissar, Comrade G. 
    
“’There is plenty of work, but few to do it! Only thirty of us, and in six hours we have to do average repairs to a baker’s dozen of waggons! Here are twin-wheels already marked. We have not only empty waggons, but also a filled cistern. . . . But that’s nothing, we’ll “make a job of it”, comrades!’ 
    
“Work went with a swing. Five comrades and I were working with hoists. Under pressure of our shoulders and two hoists, and directed by our ’foreman’, these twin-wheels, weighing from sixty to seventy poods apiece, skipped from one track to another in the liveliest possible manner. One pair disappeared, another rolled into place. At last all were in their assigned places, and swiftly we shifted the old worn out junk into a shed. . . . One, two, three—and, raised by a revolving iron hoist, they were disloged from the rails in a trice. Over there in the dark, we heard the rapid strokes of hammers; the comrades, like worker bees, were busy on their ’sick’ cars. Some were carpentering, others painting, still others were covering roofs, to the joy of the comrade commissar and our own. The smiths also asked for our aid. In a portable smithy a rod with a coupling hook was gleaming white hot, it had been bent by careless shunting. It was laid on the anvil scattering white sparks, and, under the experienced direction of the smith, our trusty hammers beat it back into its proper shape. Still red-hot and spitting sparks, we rushed it on our shoulders to where it had to go. We pushed it into its socket. A few hammer strokes and it was fixed. We crawled under the waggon. The coupling system is not as simple as it looks; there are all sorts of contraptions with rivets and springs. . . . 
    
“Work was in full swing. Night was falling. The torches seemed to burn brighter than before. Soon it would be time to knock off. Some of the comrades were taking a ’rest’ against some tires and ’sipping’ hot tea. The May night was cool, and the new moon shone beautifully like a gleaming sickle in the sky. People were laughing and joking. 
    
“’Knock off, Comrade G., thirteen waggons are enough!’ 
    
“But Comrade G. was not satisfied. 
    
“We finished our tea, broke into our songs of triumph, and marched to the door. . . . 
    
 
 The movement of “communist subbotniks” is not confined to Moscow. Pravda of June 6 reported the following:
“The first communist subbotnik in Tver took place on May 31. One hundred and twenty-eight Communists worked on the railway. In three and a half hours they loaded and unloaded fourteen waggons, repaired three locomotives, cut up ten sagenes of firewood and performed other work. The productivity of labour of the skilled communist workers was thirteen times above normal.” 
    
 
      Again, on June 8 we read in Pravda:
    

      “Communist Subbotniks”
    
 
      “Saratou, June 5. In response to the appeal of their MOSCOW comrades, the communist railway workers here at a general Party meeting resolved: to work five hours overtime on Saturdays without pay in order to support the national economy.”
 
I have given the fullest and most detailed information about the communist subbotniks because in this we undoubtedly observe one of the most important aspects of communist construction, to which our press pays insufficient attention, and which all of us have as yet failed properly to appreciate. 
 
 Less political fireworks and more attention to the simplest but living facts of communist construction, taken from and tested by actual life—this is the slogan which all of us, our writers, agitators, propagandists, organisers, etc., should repeat unceasingly. 
 
 It was natural and inevitable in the first period after the proletarian revolution that we should be engaged primarily on the main and fundamental task of overcoming the resistance of the bourgeoisie, of vanquishing the exploiters, of crushing their conspiracy (like the “slave-owners’ conspiracy” to surrender Petrograd, in which all from the Black Hundreds and Cadets to the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries were involved[1]). But simultaneously with this task, another task comes to the forefront just as inevitably and ever more imperatively as time goes on, namely, the more important task of positive communist construction, the creation of new economic relations, of a new society. 
 
 As I have had occasion to point out more than once, among other occasions in the speech I delivered at a session of the Petrograd Soviet on March 12, the dictatorship of the proletariat is not only the use of force against the exploiters, and not even mainly the use of force. The economic foundation of this use of revolutionary force, the guarantee of its effectiveness and success is the fact that the proletariat represents and creates a higher type of social organisation of labour compared with capitalism. This is what is important, this is the source of the strength and the guarantee that the final triumph of communism is inevitable. 
 
 The feudal organisation of social labour rested on the discipline of the bludgeon, while the working people, robbed and tyrannised by a handful of landowners, were utterly ignorant and downtrodden. The capitalist organisation of social labour rested on the discipline of hunger, and, not withstanding all the progress of bourgeois culture and bourgeois democracy, the vast mass of the working people in the most advanced, civilised and democratic republics remained an ignorant and downtrodden mass of wage-slaves or oppressed peasants, robbed and tyrannised by a handful of capitalists. The communist organisation of social labour the first step towards which is socialism, rests, and will do so more and more as time goes on, on the free and conscious discipline of the working people themselves who have thrown off the yoke both of the landowners and capitalists. 
 
 This new discipline does not drop from the skies, nor is it born from pious wishes; it grows out of the material conditions of large-scale capitalist production, and out of them alone. Without them it is impossible. And the repository, or the vehicle, of these material conditions is a definite historical class, created, organised, united, trained, educated and hardened by large-scale capitalism. This class is the proletariat. 
 
 If we translate the Latin, scientific, historico-philosophical term “dictatorship of the proletariat” into simpler language, it means just the following: 
 
 Only a definite class, namely, the urban workers and the factory, industrial workers in general, is able to lead the whole mass of the working and exploited people in the struggle to throw off the yoke of capital, in actually carrying it out, in the struggle to maintain and consolidate the victory, in the work of creating the new, socialist social system and in the entire struggle for the complete abolition of classes. (Let us observe in parenthesis that the only scientific distinction between socialism and communism is that the first term implies the first stage of the new society arising out of capitalism, while the second implies the next and higher stage.) 
 
 The mistake the “Berne” yellow International makes is that its leaders accept the class struggle and the leading role of the proletariat only in word and are afraid to think it out to its logical conclusion. They are afraid of- that inevitable conclusion which particularly terrifies the bourgeoisie, and which is absolutely unacceptable to them. They are afraid to admit that the dictatorship of the proletariat is also a period of class struggle, which is inevitable as long as classes have not been abolished, and which changes in form, being particularly fierce and particularly peculiar in the period immediately following the overthrow of capital. The proletariat does not cease the class struggle after it has captured political power, but continues it until classes are abolished—of course, under different circumstances, in different form and by different means. 
 
 And what does the “abolition of classes” mean? All those who call themselves socialists recognise this as the ultimate goal of socialism, but by no means all give thought to its significance. Classes are large groups of people differing from each other by the place they occupy in a historically determined system of social production, by their relation (in most cases fixed and formulated in law) to the means of production, by their role in the social organisation of labour, and, consequently, by the dimensions of the share of social wealth of which they dispose and the mode of acquiring it. Classes are groups of people one of which can appropriate the labour of another owing to the different places they occupy in a definite system of social economy. 
 
 Clearly, in order to abolish classes completely, it is not enough to overthrow the exploiters, the landowners and capitalists, not enough to abolish their rights of ownership; it is necessary also to abolish all private ownership of the means of production, it is necessary to abolish the distinction between town and country, as well as the distinction between manual workers and brain workers. This requires a very long period of time. In order to achieve this an enormous step forward must be taken in developing the productive forces; it is necessary to overcome the resistance (frequently passive, which is particularly stubborn and particularly difficult to overcome) of the numerous survivals of small-scale production; it is necessary to overcome the enormous force of habit and conservatism which are connected with these survivals. 
 
 The assumption that all “working people” are equally capable of doing this work would be on empty phrase, or the illusion of an antediluvian, pre-Marxist socialist; for this ability does not come of itself, but grows historically, and grows only out of the material conditions of large-scale capitalist production. This ability, at the beginning of the road from capitalism to socialism, is possessed by the proletariat alone. It is capable of fulfilling the gigantic task that confronts it, first, because it is the strongest and most advanced class in civilised societies; secondly, because in the most developed countries it constitutes the majority of the population, and thirdly, because in backward capitalist countries, like Russia, the majority of the population consists of semi-proletarians, i.e., of people who regularly live in a proletarian way part of the year, who regularly earn a part of their means of subsistence as wage-workers in capitalist enterprises. 
 
 Those who try to solve the problems involved in the transition from capitalism to socialism on the basis of general talk about liberty, equality, democracy in general equality of labour democracy, etc. (as Kautsky, Martov and other heroes of the Berne yellow International do), thereby only reveal their petty-bourgeois, philistine nature and ideologically slavishly follow in the wake of the bourgeoisie. The correct solution of this problem can be found only in a concrete study of the specific relations between the specific class which has conquered political power, namely, the proletariat, and the whole non-proletarian, and also semi-proletarian, mass of the working population—relations which do not take shape in fantastically harmonious, “ideal” conditions, but in the real conditions of the frantic resistance of the bourgeoisie which assumes many and diverse forms. 
 
 The vast majority of the population—and all the more so of the working population—of any capitalist country, including Russia, have thousands of times experienced, themselves and through their kith and kin, the oppression of capital, the plunder and every sort of tyranny it perpetrates. The imperialist war, i.e., the slaughter of ten million people in order to decide whether British or German capital was to have supremacy in plundering the whole world, has greatly intensified these ordeals, has increased and deepened them, and has made the people realise their meaning. Hence the inevitable sympathy displayed by the vast majority of the population, particularly the working people, for the proletariat, because it is with heroic courage and revolutionary ruthlessness throwing off the yoke of capital, overthrowing the exploiters, suppressing their resistance, and shedding its blood to pave the road for the creation of the new society, in which there will be no room for exploiters. 
 
 Great and inevitable as may be their petty-bourgeois vacillations and their tendency to go back to bourgeois “order”, under the “wing” of the bourgeoisie, the non-proletarian and semi-proletarian mass of the working population cannot but recognise the moral and political authority of the proletariat, who are not only overthrowing the exploiters and suppressing their resistance, but are building a new and higher social bond, a social discipline, the discipline of class-conscious and united working people, who know no yoke and no authority except the authority of their own unity, of their own, more class-conscious, bold, solid, revolutionary and steadfast vanguard. 
 
 In order to achieve victory, in order to build and consolidate socialism, the proletariat must fulfil a twofold or dual task: first, it must, by its supreme heroism in the revolutionary struggle against capital, win over the entire mass of the working and exploited people; it must win them over, organise them and lead them in the struggle to overthrow the bourgeoisie and utterly suppress their resistance. Secondly, it must lead the whole mass of the working and exploited people, as well as all the petty-bourgeois groups, on to the road of new economic development, towards the creation of a new social bond, a new labour discipline, a new organisation of labour, which will combine the last word in science and capitalist technology with the mass association of class-conscious workers creating large-scale socialist industry. 
 
 The second task is more difficult than the first, for it cannot possibly be fulfilled by single acts of heroic fervour; it requires the most prolonged, most persistent and most difficult mass heroism in plain, everyday work. But this task is more essential than the first, because, in the last analysis, the deepest source of strength for victories over the bourgeoisie and the sole guarantee of the durability and permanence of these victories can only be a new and higher mode of social production, the substitution of large-scale socialist production for capitalist and petty-bourgeois production. 
 
 “Communist subbotniks” are of such enormous historical significance precisely because they demonstrate the conscious and voluntary initiative of the workers in developing the productivity of labour, in adopting a new labour discipline, in creating socialist conditions of economy and life. 
 
 J. Jacoby, one of the few, in fact it would be more correct to say one of the exceptionally rare, German bourgeois democrats who, after the lessons of 1870-71, went over not to chauvinism or national-liberalism, but to socialism, once said that the formation of a single trade union was of greater historical importance than the battle of Sadowa.[2] This is true. The battle of Sadowa decided the supremacy of one of two bourgeois monarchies, the Austrian or the Prussian, in creating a German national capitalist state. The formation of one trade union was a small step towards the world victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie. And we may similarly say that the first communist subbotnik, organised by the workers of the Moscow-Kazan Railway in Moscow on May 10, 1919, was of greater historical significance than any of the victories of Hindenhurg, or of Foch and the British, in the 1914-18 imperialist war. The victories of the imperialists mean the slaughter of millions of workers for the sake of the profits of the Anglo-American and French multimillionaires, they are the atrocities of doomed capitalism, bloated with over-eating and rotting alive. The communist subbotnik organised by the workers of the Moscow Kazan Railway is one of the cells of the new, socialist society, which brings to all the peoples of the earth emancipation from the yoke of capital and from wars. 
 
 The bourgeois gentlemen and their hangers-on, including the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are wont to regard themselves as the representatives of “public opinion”, naturally jeer at the hopes of the Communists, call those hopes “a baobab tree in a mignonette pot”, sneer at the insignificance of the number of suhbotniks compared with the vast number of cases of thieving, idleness, lower productivity, spoilage of raw materials and finished goods, etc. Our reply to these gentlemen is that if the bourgeois intellectuals had dedicated their knowledge to assisting the working people instead of giving it to the Russian and foreign capitalists in order to restore their power, the revolution would have proceeded more rapidly and more peacefully. But this is utopian, for the issue is decided by the class struggle, and the majority of the intellectuals gravitate towards the bourgeoisie. Not with the assistance of the intellectuals will the proletariat achieve victory, but in spite of their opposition (at least in the majority of cases), removing those of them who are incorrigibly bourgeois, reforming, re-educating and subordinating the waverers, and gradually winning ever larger sections of them to its side. Gloating over the difficulties and setbacks of the revolution, sowing panic, preaching a return to the past—these are all weapons and methods of class struggle of the bourgeois intellectuals. The proletariat will not allow itself to be deceived by them. 
 
 If we get down to brass tacks, however, has it ever happened in history that a new mode of production has taken root immediately, without a long succession of setbacks, blunders and relapses? Half a century after the abolition of serfdom there were still quite a number of survivals of serfdom in the Russian countryside. Half a century after the abolition of slavery in America the position of the Negroes was still very often one of semi-slavery. The bourgeois intellectuals, including the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, are true to themselves in serving capital and in continuing to use absolutely false arguments—before the proletarian revolution they accused us of being utopian; after the revolution they demand that we wipe out all traces of the past with fantastic rapidity! 
 
 We are not utopians, however, and we know the real value of bourgeois “arguments”; we also know that for some time after the revolution traces of the old ethics will inevitably predominate over the young shoots of the new. When the new has just been born the old always remains stronger than it for some time, this is always the case in nature and in social life. Jeering at the feebleness of the young shoots of the new order, cheap scepticism of the intellectuals and the like—these are, essentially, methods of bourgeois class struggle against the proletariat, a defence of capitalism against socialism. We must carefully study the feeble new shoots, we must devote the greatest attention to them, do everything to promote their growth and “nurse” them. Some of them will inevitably perish. We cannot vouch that precisely the “comrnunist subbotniks” will play a particularly important role. But that is not the point. The point is to foster each and every shoot of the new; and life will select the most viable. If the Japanese scientist, in order to help mankind vanquish syphilis, had the patience to test six hundred and five preparations before he developed a six hundred and sixth which met definite requirements then those who want to solve a more difficult problem, namely, to vanquish capitalism, must have the perseverance to try hundreds and thousands of new methods, means and weapons of struggle in order to elaborate the most suitable of them. 
 
 The “communist subbotniks” are so important because they were initiated by workers who were by no means placed in exceptionally good conditions, by workers of various specialities, and some with no speciality at all, just unskilled labourers, who are living under ordinary, i.e., exceedingly hard, conditions. We all know very well the main cause of the decline in the productivity of labour that is to be observed not only in Russia, but all over the world; it is ruin and impoverishment, embitterment and weariness caused by the imperialist war, sickness and malnutrition. The latter is first in importance. Starvation—that is the cause. And in order to do away with starvation, productivity of labour must be raised in agriculture, in transport and in industry. So, we get a sort of vicious circle: in order to raise productivity of labour we must save ourselves from starvation, and in order to save ourselves from starvation we must raise productivity of labour. 
 
 We know that in practice such contradictions are solved by breaking the vicious circle, by bringing about a radical change in the temper of the people, by the heroic initiative of the individual groups which often plays a decisive role against the background of such a radical change. The unskilled labourers and railway workers of Moscow (of course, we have in mind the majority of them, and not a handful of profiteers, officials and other whiteguards) are working people who are living in desperately hard conditions. They are constantly underfed, and now, before the new harvest is gathered, with the general worsening of the food situation, they are actually starving. And yet these starving workers, surrounded by the malicious counter-revolutionary agitation of the bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, are organising “communist subbotniks”, working overtime without any pay, and achieving an enormous increase in the productivity of labour in spite of the fact that they are weary, tormented, and exhausted by malnutrition. Is this not supreme heroism? Is this not the beginning of a change of momentous significance? 
 
 In the last analysis, productivity of labour is the most important, the principal thing for the victory of the new social system. Capitalism created a productivity of labour unknown under serfdom. Capitalism can be utterly vanquished, and will be utterly vanquished by socialism creating a new and much higher productivity of labour. This is a very difficult matter and must take a long time; but it has been started, and that is the main thing. If in starving Moscow, in the summer of 1919, the starving workers who had gone through four trying years of imperialist war and another year and a half of still more trying civil war could start this great work, how will things develop later when we triumph in the civil war and win peace? 
 
 Communism is the higher productivity of labour—compared with that existing under capitalism—of voluntary, class-conscious and united workers employing advanced techniques. Communist subbotniks are extraordinarily valuable as the actual beginning of communism ; and this is a very rare thing, because we are in a stage when “only the first steps in the transition from capitalism to communism are being taken” (as our Party Programme quite rightly says). 
 
 Communism begins when the rank-and-file workers display an enthusiastic concern that is undaunted by arduous toil to increase the productivity of labour, husband every pood of grain, coal, iron and other products, which do not accrue to the workers personally or to their “close” kith and kin, but to their “distant” kith and kin, i. e., to society as a whole, to tens and hundreds of millions of people united first in one socialist state, and then in a union of Soviet republics. 
 
 In Capital, Karl Marx ridicules the pompous and grandiloquent bourgeois-democratic great charter of liberty and the rights of man, ridicules all this phrase-mongering about liberty, equality and fraternity in general, which dazzles the petty bourgeois and philistines of all countries, including the present despicable heroes of the despicable Berne International. Marx contrasts these pompous declarations of rights to the plain, modest, practical, simple manner in which the question is presented by the proletariat—the legislative enactment of a shorter working day is a typical example of such treatment.[3] The aptness and profundity of Marx’s observation become the clearer and more obvious to us the more the content of the proletarian revolution unfolds. The “formulas” of genuine communism differ from the pompous, intricate, and solemn phraseology of the Kautskys, the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries and their beloved “brethren” of Berne in that they reduce every thing to the conditions of labour. Less chatter about “labour democracy”, about “liberty, equality and fraternity”, about “government by the people”, and all such stuff; the class conscious workers and peasants of our day see through these pompous phrases of the bourgeois intellectual and discern the trickery as easily as a person of ordinary common sense and experience, when glancing at the irreproachably “polished” features and immaculate appearance of the “fain fellow, dontcher know”, immediately and unerringly puts him down as “in all probability, a scoundrel”. 
 
 Fewer pompous phrases, more plain, everyday work, concern for the pood of grain and the pood of coal! More concern about providing this pood of grain and pood of coal needed by the hungry workers and ragged and barefoot peasants not by haggling, not in a capitalist manner, but by the conscious, voluntary, boundlessly heroic labour of plain working men like the unskilled labourers and railwaymen of the Moscow-Kazan line. 
 
 We must all admit that vestiges of the bourgeois-intellectual phrase-mongering approach to questions of the revolution are in evidence at every step, everywhere, even in our own ranks. Our press, for example, does little to fight these rotten survivals of the rotten, bourgeois-democratic past; it does little to foster the simple, modest, ordinary but viable shoots of genuine communism. 
 
 Take the position of womem In this field, not a single democratic party in the world, not even in the most advanced bourgeois republic, has done in decades so much as a hundredth part of what we did in our very first year in power. We really razed to the ground the infamous laws placing women in a position of inequality, restricting divorce and surrounding it with disgusting formalities, denying recognition to children born out of wedlock, enforcing a search for their fathers, etc., laws numerous survivals of which, to the shame of the bourgeoisie and of capitalism, are to be found in all civilised countries. We have a thousand times the right to be proud of what we have done in this field. But the more thoroughly we have cleared the ground of the lumber of the old, bourgeois laws and institutions, the clearer it is to us that we have only cleared the ground to build on but are not yet building. 
 
 Notwithstanding all the laws emancipating woman, she continues to be a domestic slave, because petty housework crushes, strangles, stultifies and degrades her, chains her to the kitchen and the nursery, and she wastes her labour on barbarously unproductive, petty, nerve-racking, stultifying and crushing drudgery. The real emancipation of women, real communism, will begin only where and when an all-out struggle begins (led by the proletariat wielding the state power) against this petty housekeeping, or rather when its wholesale transformation into a large-scale socialist economy begins. 
 
 Do we in practice pay sufficient attention to this question, which in theory every Communist considers indisputable? Of course not. Do we take proper care of the shoots of communism which already exist in this sphere? Again the answer is no. Public catering establishments, nurseries, kindergartens—here we have examples of these shoots, here we have the simple, everyday means, involving nothing pompous, grandiloquent or ceremonial, which can really emancipate women, really lessen and abolish their inequality with men as regards their role in social production and public life. These means are not new, they (like all the material prerequisites for socialism) were created by large-scale capitalism. But under capitalism they remained, first, a rarity, and secondly—which is particularly important—either profit-making enterprises, with all the worst features of speculation, profiteering, cheating and fraud, or “acrobatics of bourgeois charity”, which the best workers rightly hated and despised. 
 
 There is no doubt that the number of these institutions in our country has increased enormously and that they are beginning to change in character. There is no doubt that we have far more organising talent among the working and peasant women than we are aware of, that we have far more people than we know of who can organise practical work, with the co-operation of large numbers of workers and of still larger numbers of consumers, without that abundance of talk, fuss, squabbling and chatter about plans, systems, etc., with which our big-headed “intellectuals” or half-baked “Communists” are “affected”. But we do not nurse these shoots of the new as we should. 
 
 Look at the bourgeoisie. How very well they know how to advertise what they need! See how millions of copies of their newspapers extol what the capitalists regard as “model” enterprises, and how “model” bourgeois institutions are made an object of national pride! Our press does not take the trouble, or hardly ever, to describe the best catering establishments or nurseries, in order, by daily insistence, to get some of them turned into models of their kind. It does not give them enough publicity, does not describe in detail the saving in human labour, the conveniences for the consumer, the economy of products, the emancipation of women from domestic slavery, the improvement in sanitary conditions, that can be achieved with exemplary communist work and extended to the whole of society, to all working people. 
 
 Exemplary production, exemplary communist subbotniks, exemplary care and conscientiousness in procuring and distributing every pood of grain, exemplary catering establishments, exemplary cleanliness in such-and-such a workers’ house, in such-and-such a block, should all receive ten times more attention and care from our press, as well as from every workers’ and peasants’ organisation, than they receive now. All these are shoots of communism, and it is our common and primary duty to nurse them. Difficult as our food and production situation is, in the year and a half of Bolshevik rule there has been undoubted progress all along the line : grain procurements have increased from 30 million poods (from August 1,1917 to August 1, 1918) to 100 million poods (from August 1, 1918 to May 1, l919); vegetable gardening has expanded, the margin of unsown land has diminished, railway transport has begun to improve despite the enormous fuel difficulties, and so on. Against this general background, and with the support of the proletarian state power, the shoots of communism will not wither; they will grow and blossom into complete communism. 

 
 We must give very great thought to the significance of the “communist subbotniks”, in order that we may draw all the very important practical lessons that follow from this great beginning. 
 
 The first and main lesson is that this beginning must be given every assistance. The word “commune” is being handled much too freely. Any kind of enterprise started by Communists or with their participation is very often at once declared to be a “commune”, it being not infrequently forgotten that this very honourable title must be won by prolonged and persistent effort, by practical achievement in genuine communist development. 
 
 That is why, in my opinion, the decision that has matured in the minds of the majority of the members of the Central Executive Committee to repeal the decree of the Council of People’s Commissars, as far as it pertains to the title “consumers’ communes”,[4] is quite right. Let the title be simpler—and, incidentally, the defects and shortcomings of the initial stages of the new organisational work will not be blamed on the “communes”, but (as in all fairness they should be) on bad Communists. It would be a good thing to eliminate the word “commune” from common use, to prohibit every Tom, Dick and Harry from grabbing at it, or to allow this title to be borne only by genuine communes, which have really demonstrated in practice (and have proved by the unanimous recognition of the whole of the surrounding population) that they are capable of organising their work in a communist manner. First show that you are capable of working without remuneration in the interests of society, in the interests of all the working people, show that you are capable of “working in a revolutionary way”, that you are capable of raising productivity of labour, of organising the work in an exemplary manner, and then hold out your hand for the honourable title “commune”! 
 
 In this respect, the “communist subbotniks” are a most valuable exception; for the unskilled labourers and railwaymen of the Moscow-Kazan Railway first demonstrated by deeds that they are capable of working like Communists and then adopted the title of “communist subbotniks” for their undertaking. We must see to it and make sure that in future anyone who calls his enterprise, institution or undertaking a commune without having proved this by hard work and practical success in prolonged effort, by exemplary and truly communist organisation, is mercilessly ridiculed and pilloried as a charlatan or a windbag. 
 
 That great beginning, the”communist subbotniks”, must also be utilised for another purpose, namely, to purge the Party. In the early period following the revolution, when the mass of “honest” and philistine-minded people was particularly timorous, and when the bourgeois intellectuals to a man, including, of course, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, played the lackey to the bourgeoisie and carried on sabotage, it was absolutely inevitable that adventurers and other pernicious elements should hitch themselves to the ruling party. There never has been, and there never can be, a revolution without that. The whole point is that the ruling party should be able, relying on a sound and strong advanced class, to purge its ranks. 
 
 We started this work long ago. It must be continued steadily and untiringly. The mobilisation of Communists for the war helped us in this respect: the cowards and scoundrels fled from the Party’s ranks. Good riddance! Such a reduction in the Party’s membership means an enormous increase in its strength and weight. We must continue the purge, and that new beginning, the”communist subbotniks”, must be utilised for this purpose: members should be accepted into the Party only after six months’, say, “trial”, or “probation”, at “working in a revolutionary way”. A similar test should be demanded of all members of the Party who joined after October 25, 1917, and who have not proved by some special work or service that they are absolutely reliable, loyal and capable of being Communists. 
 
 The purging of the Party, through the steadily increasing demands it makes in regard to working in a genuinely communist way, will improve the state apparatus and will bring much nearer the final transition of the peasants to the side of the revolutionary proletariat. 
 
 Incidentally, the “communist subbotniks” have thrown a remarkably strong light on the class character of the state apparatus under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Central Committee of the Party drafts a letter on “working in a revolutionary way”.[5] The idea is suggested by the Central Committee of a party with from 100,000 to 200,000 members (I assume that that is the number that will remain after a thorough purging; at present the membership is larger). 
 
 The idea is taken up by the workers organised in trade unions. In Russia and the Ukraine they number about four million. The overwhelming majority of them are for the state power of the proletariat, for proletarian dictatorship. Two hundred thousand and four million—such is the ratio of the “gear-wheels”, if one may so express it. Then follow the tens of millions of peasants, who are divided into three main groups: the most numerous and the one standing closest to the proletariat is that of the semi-proletarians or poor peasants; then come the middle peasants, and lastly the numerically very small group of kulaks or rural bourgeoisie. 
 
 As long as it is possible to trade in grain and to make profit out of famine, the peasant will remain (and this will for some time be inevitable under the dictatorship of the proletariat) a semi-working man, a semi-profiteer. As a profiteer he is hostile to us, hostile to the proletarian state; he is inclined to agree with the bourgeoisie and their faithful lackeys, up to and including the Menshevik Sher or the Socialist-Revolutionary B. Chernellkov, who stand for freedom to trade in grain. But as a working man, the peasant is a friend of the proletarian state, a most loyal ally of the worker in the struggle against the landowner and against the capitalist. As working men, the peasants, the vast mass of them, the peasant millions, support the state “machine” which is headed by the one or two hundred thousand Communists of the proletarian vanguard, and which consists of millions of organised proletarians. 
 
 A state more democratic, in the true sense of the word, one more closely connected with the working and exploited people, has never yet existed.
 
 It is precisely proletarian work such as that put into “communist subbotniks” that will win the complete respect and love of peasants for the proletarian state. Such work and such work alone will completely convince the peasant that we are right, that communism is right, and make him our devoted ally, and, hence, will lead to the complete elimination of our food difficulties, to the complete victory of communism over capitalism in the matter of the production and distribution of grain, to the unqualified consolidation of communism.

[1] This refers to the plot to surrender Petrograd that was led by a spy and sabotage organisation which included Constitutional-Democrats, Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries. The organisation was headed by the “national centre” functioning on the instructions of foreign espionage agencies. On June 13, 1919, the conspirators raised a counter-revolutionary revolt at the Krasnaya Gorka (Red Hill) and Seraya Loshad (Grey Horse) forts. The revolt was quickly suppressed by Soviet troops.

“Work in a Revolutionary Way”

Comrades, 

      This is one of the most critical, probably even the most
      critical moment for the socialist revolution. Those who defend
      the exploiters, the landowners and capitalists, in Russia and
      abroad (primarily in Britain and France) are making a desperate
      effort to restore the power of those who seize the results of
      the people’s labour, the landowners and exploiters of
      Russia, in order to bolster up their power, which is waning all
      over the world. The British and French capitalists have failed
      in their plan to conquer the Ukraine using their own troops;
      they have failed in their support of Kolchak in Siberia; the Red
      Army, heroically advancing in the Urals with the help of the
      Urals workers who are rising to a man, is nearing Siberia to
      liberate it from the incredible tyranny and brutality of the
      capitalists who rule there. Lastly, the British and French
      imperialists have failed in their plan to seize Petrograd by
      means of a counter-revolutionary conspiracy with the
      participation of Russian monarchists, Cadets, Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries (not excluding even Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries). 
The foreign capitalists are now making a desperate effort to
    restore the yoke of capital by means of an onslaught by Denikin,
    whom they have supplied with officers, shells, tanks, etc., etc.,
    as they once did Kolchak. 
All the forces of the workers and peasants, all the forces of
    the Soviet Republic, must be harnessed to repulse Denikin’s
    onslaught and to defeat him, without checking the Red Army’s
    victorious advance into the Urals and Siberia.  That is the

 Main Task Of The Moment  

      All Communists first and foremost, all sympathisers with them,
      all honest workers and peasants, all Soviet officials must
      pull themselves together like soldiers and concentrate
      to the maximum their work, their efforts and their
      concern directly on the tasks of the war, on the speedy
      repulse of Denikin’s attack, curtailing and rearranging
      all their other activities to allow for this task. 
The Soviet Republic is besieged by the enemy. It must become
    a single military camp, not in word but in deed. 
All the work of all institutions most be adapted to the war and
    placed on a military footing! 
Collegiate methods are essential for the conduct of the affairs
    of the workers’ and peasants’ state. But any expansion
    of these methods, any distortion of them resulting in red tape and
    irresponsibility, any conversion of collegiate bodies into
    talk-shops is a supreme evil, an evil which must be halted at all
    costs as quickly as possible and by whatever the means. 
Collegiate methods must not exceed an absolutely indispensable
    minimum in respect both to the number of members in the committees
    and to the efficient conduct of work; “speechifying”
    must be prohibited, opinions must be exchanged as rapidly as
    possible and confined to information and precisely formulated
    practical proposals. 
Whenever there is the slightest possibility, such methods must
    be reduced to the briefest discussion of only the most important
    questions in the narrowest collegiate bodies, while the
    practical management of institutions, enterprises,
    undertakings or tasks should be entrusted to one comrade,
    known for his firmness, resolution, boldness and ability to
    conduct practical affairs and who enjoys the greatest
    confidence. At any rate, and under all circumstances without
    exception, collegiate management must be accompanied by the
    priciest definition of the personal responsibility of
    every individual for a precisely defined job. To
    refer to collegiate methods as an excuse for irresponsibility is a
    most dangerous evil, threatening all who have not had very
    extensive experience in efficient collective work; in the army  it
    all too often leads to inevitable disaster, chaos, panic, division
    of authority and defeat. 
A no less dangerous evil is organisational fuss or
    organisational fantasies. The reorganisation of work necessitated
    by the war must under no circumstances lead to the reorganisation
    of institutions, still less to the hasty formation of new
    institutions. That is absolutely impermissible and would only lead
    to chaos. The reorganisation of work should consist in suspending
    for a time institutions which are not absolutely essential, or in
    reducing their size to a certain extent. But all war work must be
    conducted entirely and exclusively through already
    existing military institutions, by improving, strengthening,
    expanding and supporting them. The creation of special
    “defence committees” or “revcoms”
    (revolutionary or revolutionary military committees) is
    permissible, first, only by way of exception, secondly, only with
    the approval of the military authority concerned or the superior
    Soviet authority, and, thirdly, only provided this last condition
    is complied with. 

  The Truth About Kolchak And Denikin 
      Must Be Explained To The People 
    
Kolchak and Denikin are the chief, and the only serious,
    enemies of the Soviet Republic. If it were not for the help they
    are getting from the Entente (Britain, France, America) they would
    have collapsed long ago. It is only the help of the Entente which
    makes them strong. Nevertheless, they are still forced to deceive
    the people, to pretend from time to time that they support
    “democracy”, a “constituent assembly”,
    “government by the people”, etc. The Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries are only too willing to be duped. 
The truth about Kolchak (and his double, Denikin) has now been
    revealed in full. The shooting of tens of thousands of
    workers. The shooting even of Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries. The flogging of peasants of entire
    districts. The public flogging of women. The absolutely unbridled
    power of the officers, the sons of landowners. Endless
    looting. Such is the truth about Kolchak and Denikin. Increasing
    numbers of people even among the Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, who themselves betrayed the workers and
    sided with Kolchak and Denikin, are forced to admit this
    truth. 
All our agitation and propaganda must serve to inform the
    people of the truth. It must be explained that the alternative is
    either Kolchak and Denikin or Soviet power, the power
    (dictatorship) of the workers. There is no middle course; there
    can be no middle course. Particular use must be made of the
    testimony of non-Bolshevik eyewitnesses, of Mensheviks,
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, and non-party people who have
    been in the areas overrun by Kolchak or Denikin. Let every
    worker and peasant know what the issue of the struggle is, what
    awaits him in the event of a victory for Kolchak or Denikin. 

  Work Among Men Called Up For Service
    

      One of our chief concerns must now be work among those liable to
      mobilisation, in aid of mobilisation, and among those already
      mobilised. Wherever mobilised men are concentrated, or where
      there are garrisons, and especially training depots, etc., every
      single Communist and sympathiser must be brought into
      action. They must all without exception unite and work, some
      daily, others, say, four or eight hours per week, in aid of
      mobilisation and among mobilised men, among the soldiers of the
      local garrison; it must be done in a properly organised manner,
      of course, each person being assigned appropriate work by the
      local Party organisation and the military authorities. 
Non-party people or members of parties other than the Communist
    Party are naturally not in a position to carry on ideological work
    against Denikin or Kolchak. But to release them for that reason
    from all work would be impermissible. Every means must be sought
    that would compel the whole population (and the wealthier
    sections, both in town and country, in the first place) to
    contribute their share, in one form or another, to help
    mobilisation or the mobilised. 
Measures to further the quickest and most effective training of
    the mobilised should form a special category of aid. The Soviet
    government is calling up all ex-officers,  non-commissioned
    officers, etc. The Communist Party, as well as all sympathisers
    and all workers, must assist the workers’ and
    peasants’ state, first, by helping to round up all
    ex-officers, non-commissioned officers, etc., who do not report
    for service, and, secondly, by organising, under the control of
    the Party organisation or attached to it, groups of those who have
    had theoretical or practical (e.g., in the imperialist war)
    military training and who are capable of doing their share. 
Work Among Deserters
    

      An obvious change for the better has latterly taken place in the
      fight against desertion. In a number of gubernias
      deserters have begun to return to the army en masse; it is no
      exaggeration to say that deserters are flocking to the Red
      Army. The reasons are, first, that Party comrades are working
      more efficiently and systematically, and, secondly, the
      peasants’ growing realisation that Kolchak and Denikin
      mean the restoration of a regime which is worse than the
      tsarist, the restoration of slavery for the workers and
      peasants, and of floggings, robbery and insults on the part of
      the officers and scions of the nobility. 
We must therefore everywhere lay special stress on the work
    among deserters to bring them back into the army, and must
    spare no effort in this work. That is one of the primary
    and urgent tasks of the day. 
Incidentally, the fact that deserters can be influenced by
    persuasion and that the persuasion can be effective shows
    that the workers’ state has a special attitude
    towards the peasants, and in this it differs from the landowner or
    capitalist state The rule of the bludgeon or the rule of
    hunger—that is what constitutes the sole source of
    discipline of the latter two forms of state. A different
    source of discipline is possible in the case of the workers’
    state, or the dictatorship of the proletariat—that of
    persuasion of the peasants by the workers, a comradely alliance
    between them. When you hear the accounts of eyewitnesses that in
    such-and-such a gubernia (Ryazan, for instance) thousands
    upon thousands of deserters are returning voluntarily, that the
    appeal at meetings to “comrades deserters” sometimes
    has a success  which beggars all description, you begin to realise
    how much untapped strength there is in this comradely
    alliance between workers and peasants. The peasant has his
    prejudice, which makes him inclined to support the
    capitalist, the Socialist-Revolutionary, and “freedom to
    trade”, but he also has his sound judgement, which
    is impelling him more and more towards an alliance with the
    workers. 

 Direct Aid To The Army
    

      What our army needs most is supplies—clothing,
      foot wear, arms, shells. With the country impoverished as it is,
      an immense effort has to be made to satisfy the army’s
      needs, and it is only the assistance which the capitalist
      robbers of Britain, France and America are so lavishly rendering
      Kolchak and Denikin that saves them from inevitable disaster due
      to shortage of supplies. 
But impoverished though Russia is, she still has endless
    resources which we have not yet utilised, and often have shown
    no ability to utilise. There are still many undisclosed
    or uninspected military stores, plenty of production
    potentialities which are being overlooked, partly owing to the
    deliberate sabotage of officials, partly owing to red tape,
    bureaucracy, inefficiency and incompetence—all those
    “sins of the past” which so inevitably and so
    drastically weigh upon every revolution which makes a
    “leap” into a new social order. 
Direct aid to the army in this respect is particularly
    important. The institutions in charge of it are particularly in
    need of “fresh blood”, of outside assistance, of the
    voluntary, vigorous and heroic initiative of the workers
    and peasants in the localities. 
We must appeal as widely as possible to the initiative of all
    class-conscious workers and peasants, and of all Soviet officials;
    we must test in different localities and in different fields of
    work different forms of assistance to the army in this
    respect. “Work in a revolutionary way” is far less in
    evidence here than in other spheres, yet “work in a
    revolutionary way” is needed here far more. 
The collection of arms from the population is an integral part
    of this work. It is natural that plenty of arms should  have been
    hidden by the peasants and the bourgeoisie in a country which has
    been through four years of imperialist war followed by two
    people’s revolutions—it was inevitable that this
    should happen. But we must combat it with all our might
    now, in face of Denikin’s menacing onslaught whoever
    conceals or helps to conceal arms is guilty of a grave crime
    against the workers and peasants and deserves to be shot, for he
    is responsible for the death of thousands upon thousands of the
    finest Red Army men, who not infrequently perish only because of a
    shortage of arms at the fronts. 
The Petrograd comrades succeeded in unearthing thousands and
    thousands of rifles when they conducted mass searches in a
    strictly organised way. The rest of Russia must not lag behind
    Petrograd and must at all costs over take and outstrip it. 
On the other hand, there is no doubt that the largest numbers
    of rifles are hidden by the peasants, and often without the least
    evil intention, but solely from an ingrained distrust of any
    “state”, etc. If we have been able to do much, very
    much (in the best gubernias) by means of
    persuasion, skilful agitation and a proper approach to
    get deserters to return to the Red Army voluntarily, there can be
    no doubt that just as much, if not more, can be done, and should
    be done, to secure a voluntary return of arms. 
Workers and peasants, look for concealed rifles and turn them
    over to the army! By doing so you will save yourselves from being
    massacred, shot, flogged wholesale and robbed by Kolchak and
    Denikin! 

  Curtailment Of Work Not For The War
    

      To carry out even a part of the work briefly outlined above we
      shall need more and more workers, drawn, moreover, from the
      ranks of the most reliable, devoted and energetic
      Communists. But where are they to come from, bearing in mind the
      universal complaints about the dearth of such workers and the
      over-fatigue they are suffering from? 
There can be no doubt that these complaints are largely
    justified. If anyone were to gauge exactly how thin is that
    stratum of advanced workers and Communists who with the support
    and sympathy of the worker and peasant masses  have administered
    Russia in these last twenty months, it would seem truly
    incredible. Yet we administered with signal success, building
    socialism, overcoming unparalleled difficulties, and vanquishing
    enemies, directly or indirectly connected with the bourgeoisie,
    that raised their heads everywhere. We have already vanquished all
    enemies except one—the Entente, the all-powerful imperialist
    bourgeoisie of Britain, France and America. And we have broken one
    of the arms of this enemy too—Kolchak. We are only
    threatened by his other arm—Denikin. 
Fresh labour-power for the administration of the state and to
    carry out the tasks of the dictatorship of the proletariat are
    rapidly emerging in the shape of the worker and peasant youth who
    are most earnestly, zealously and fervidly learning, digesting the
    new impressions of the new order, throwing off the husk of old,
    capitalist and bourgeois democratic prejudices, and moulding
    themselves into even firmer Communists than the older
    generation. 
But however rapidly this new stratum may be emerging, however
    rapidly it may be learning and maturing in the fire of the Civil
    War and the frantic resistance of the bourgeoisie, all the same it
    cannot, in the next few months, supply us with a trained
    staff for the administration of the state. Yet it is precisely the
    next few months, the summer and autumn of 1919, that count, for it
    is essential to decide the struggle against Denikin, and
    it must be done immediately. 
In order to obtain a large number of well-trained workers to
    strengthen the war effort we must reduce in size a whole
    number of branches and institutions, not doing war work, or,
    rather, those not directly connected with the war, but doing
    Soviet work; we must reorganise on these lines (i.e., on
    the lines of reduction) all institutions and enterprises which are
    not absolutely indispensable. 
Take, as a case in point, the Scientific and Technological
    Department of the Supreme Economic Council. This is a highly
    valuable institution, one indispensable for the building of
    full-scale socialism and to account for and distribute all our
    scientific and technological forces properly. But is such an
    institution absolutely indispensable? Of course not. To assign to
    it people who could and should be immediately employed in urgent
    and absolutely indispensable communist work in the army
    or directly for the army would, at the present juncture,
    be a downright crime. 
There are quite a number of such institutions and departments
    of institutions in the centre and in the localities. In our
    efforts to achieve socialism in full we had to begin to set up
    such institutions immediately. But we would be fools or criminals,
    if, in the face of Denikin’s formidable attack, we were
    unable to reform our ranks in such a way as to
    suspend or reduce everything that is not
    absolutely indispensable. 
We must not give way to panic or succumb to the organisational
    urge and must not reorganise any institutions nor close them down
    altogether nor—which is particularly harmful when being done
    in haste—must we begin to build new institutions. What we
    must do is to suspend for three, four or five months
    all institutions or departments of institutions, both in
    the centre and in the localities, which are not absolutely
    indispensable, or, if it is not possible to suspend them
    altogether, reduce them for the same (approximately)
    period, reduce them to the greatest possible extent, in other
    words, reduce the work to an absolutely indispensable
    minimum. 
Inasmuch as our main purpose is to secure at once a large
    number of well-trained, experienced, devoted and tested Communists
    or socialist sympathisers for military work, we can incur the risk
    of temporarily leaving many of the heavily curtailed institutions
    (or departments of institutions) without a single
    Communist, of placing them exclusively in the hands of
    bourgeois executives. That is not a big risk, for it is only
    institutions which are not absolutely indispensable that are
    involved, and while there will certainly be a loss from the
    weakening of their (semi-suspended) activities, it will not be a
    great loss, and one which at any rate will not be fatal to
    us. Whereas insufficient energy in strengthening war work, and
    strengthening it immediately and considerably, may prove fatal to
    us. This must be clearly understood and all the necessary
    conclusions drawn from it. 
If every manager of a government department or of a division of
    a government department in every gubernia, uyezd,  etc.,
    if every Communist nucleus, without losing a moment, asks, is
    such-and-such an institution, such-and-such a department
    absolutely indispensable, shall we perish if we suspend it or
    reduce its activities by nine-tenths and leave no Communists in it
    at all?—if the posing of this question is followed by speedy
    and resolute reduction of work and withdrawal of Communists
    (together with their absolutely reliable assistants among the
    sympathisers or non-party people), in a very short time we shall
    have hundreds upon hundreds of persons for work in the political
    departments of the army, as commissars, etc. And then we shall
    have a very good chance of defeating Denikin, just as we have
    defeated the much stronger Kolchak. 

Work In The Front Zone
    

      The front zone in the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet
      Republic has greatly increased in the past few weeks and has
      undergone an extremely rapid change. This is a harbinger or
      concomitant of the decisive moment of the war, of its
      approaching concluding phase. 
On the one hand, a vast front zone west of the Urals and in the
    Ural Mountains proper has become our front zone owing to the
    victories of the Red Army, the disintegration of Kolchak, and the
    growth of revolution in Kolchakia. On the other hand, an even
    larger zone near Petrograd and in the South has become a
    front zone owing to our losses, owing to the immense advance made
    by the enemy towards Petrograd and the advance from the South into
    the Ukraine and towards the centre of Russia. 
Work in the front zone is assuming cardinal importance. 
In the Cis-Urals area, where the Red Army, is rapidly
    advancing, there is a natural desire among army
    workers—commissars, members of political departments,
    etc.—as well as among local workers and peasants, to settle
    down in the newly won localities for constructive Soviet work, a
    desire which is the more natural, the greater the war fatigue and
    the more distressful the picture of the destruction wrought by
    Kolchak. But nothing could be more dangerous than to yield to this
    desire. It would threaten to weaken our offensive, to retard it,
    and to increase Kolchak’s chances of  recovering his
    strength. It would be a downright crime against the revolution on
    our part. 
Under no circumstances must a single extra worker be taken from
    the Eastern Army for local work![Unless there
    is urgent need none at all should be taken, but people should be
    transferred from the central gubernias! ] Under no
    circumstances can the offensive be weakened! The only chance we
    have of complete victory is for the entire population of the Urals
    area, who have experienced the horrors of Kolchak
    “democracy”, to take part in it to a man, and to
    continue the offensive into Siberia until the complete
    victory of the revolution in Siberia. 
Let organisational work in the Cis-Urals and the Urals area be
    delayed, let it proceed less intensively, being done by local,
    young, inexperienced and weak forces alone. We shall not perish
    from that. But if we weaken the offensive against the
    Urals and Siberia we shall perish. We must
    strengthen that offensive with the forces of the
    insurgent workers in the Urals, with the forces of the Cis-Urals
    peasants, who have now learned to their cost the meaning of the
    “constituent” promises of the Menshevik Maisky and the
    Socialist-Revolutionary Chernov, and the real meaning of these
    promises, i.e., Kolchak. 
To weaken the offensive against the Urals and Siberia would be
    to betray the revolution, to betray the cause of the emancipation
    of the workers and peasants from the Kolchak yoke. 
It should be remembered in connection with the work in the
    front zone which has only just been liberated that the main task
    there is to make not only the workers, but the peasants as well,
    put their faith in Soviet power, to explain to them in practice
    that Soviet power means the power of the workers and peasants, and
    at once to take the right course, the course adopted by the Party
    from the experience of twenty months of work. We must not repeat
    in the Urals the mistakes which were sometimes made in Great
    Russia and which we are rapidly learning to avoid. 
In the front zone outside Petrograd and in that vast front zone
    which has been growing so rapidly and menacingly in the Ukraine
    and in the South, absolutely everything  must be put on a war
    footing, and all work, all efforts, all thoughts subordinated to
    the war and only the war. Otherwise it will be impossible to
    repulse Denikin’s attack. That is clear. And this must be
    clearly understood and fully put into practice. 
Incidentally. A feature of Denikin’s army is the large
    number of officers and Cossacks in it. This is an element which,
    having no mass force behind it, is extremely likely to engage in
    swift raids, in gambles, in desperate ventures, with the object of
    sowing panic and causing destruction for destruction’s
    sake.
In fighting such a foe military discipline and military
    vigilance of the highest degree are necessary. To be caught
    napping or to lose one’s head means losing everything. Every
    responsible Party and Soviet worker must bear this in mind.
Military discipline in military and all other matters! 
Military vigilance and strictness, and firmness in the adoption
    of all measures of precaution!

  Attitude Towards Military Experts
    
The vast conspiracy hatched at Krasnaya Gorka and whose purpose
    was the surrender of Petrograd has again brought forward and with
    particular emphasis the question of the military experts and of
    combating counter-revolution in the rear. There can be no doubt
    that the aggravation of the food and war situation is inevitably
    stimulating, and will continue to stimulate in the immediate
    future, still greater efforts by the counter-revolutionaries (in
    the Petrograd plot there participated the League of Regeneration,
    Cadets, Mensheviks and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries; the Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries also participated, as a separate group,
    it is true, but they did participate nevertheless). Nor can there
    be any doubt that the military experts, like the kulaks, the
    bourgeois intellectuals, the Mensheviks and the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, will in the near future give a bigger
    proportion of traitors. 
But it would be an irreparable mistake and unpardonable
    weakness of character to raise on this account the question  of
    changing the fundamental principles of our army policy. Hundreds
    and hundreds of military experts are betraying us and will betray
    us; we will catch them and shoot them, but thousands and tens of
    thousands of military experts have been working for us
    systematically and for a long time, and without them we could not
    have formed the Red Army, which has grown out of the guerrilla
    force of evil memory, and has been able to score brilliant
    victories in the East. Experienced people who head our War
    Department rightly point out that where the Party policy in regard
    to the military experts and the extirpation of the guerrilla
    spirit has been adhered to most strictly, where discipline is
    firmest, where political work among the troops and the work of the
    commissars is conducted most thoroughly, there, generally
    speaking, the number of military experts inclined to betray us is
    the lowest, there the opportunities for those who are so inclined
    to carry out their designs are the slightest, there we have no
    laxity in the army, there its organisation and morale are best,
    and there we have the most victories. The guerrilla spirit, its
    vestiges, remnants and survivals have been the cause of
    immeasurably greater misfortune, disintegration, defeats,
    disasters and losses in men and military equipment in our army and
    in the Ukrainian army than all the betrayals of the military
    experts. 
Our Party Programme, both on the general subject of bourgeois
    experts, and on the particular problem of one of their varieties,
    the military experts, has defined the policy of the Communist
    Party with absolute precision. Our Party is waging and will
    continue to wage “a relentless struggle against the
    pseudo-radical but actually ignorant and conceited opinion that
    the working people are capable of overcoming capitalism and the
    bourgeois social system without learning from bourgeois
    specialists, without making use of their services and without
    undergoing the training of a lengthy period of work side
    by side with them”. 
 At the same time, of course, the Party does not make the
    “slightest political concession to this bourgeois section of
    the population”, the Party suppresses and will continue
    “ruthlessly to suppress any counter-revolutionary attempts
    on its part”. Naturally, whenever such an
    “attempt” is made or becomes more or less probable,
    its “ruthless  suppression” requires other qualities
    than the deliberateness, the cautiousness of an apprentice, which
    are demanded for lengthy training, and which the latter
    inculcates. The contradiction between the attitude of people
    engaged in the “lengthy period of work side by side”
    with the military experts, and the attitude of people absorbed in
    the direct task of “ruthlessly suppressing a
    counter-revolutionary attempt” of military experts might
    easily lead, and does lead, to friction and conflict. The same
    applies to the necessary changes of personnel, the shifting around
    sometimes of large numbers of military experts which is
    necessitated by instances of counter-revolutionary
    “attempts”, and all the more by large-scale
    conspiracies. 
We settle, and will continue to settle, such friction and
    conflicts in the Party way, demanding the same of all the Party
    organisations and insisting that not the slightest damage to
    practical work, not the slightest delay in the adoption of
    essential measures, not a shadow of hesitation in the observance
    of the established principles of our military policy be
    tolerated. 
If some of our Party bodies adopt an incorrect tone towards the
    military experts (as was recently the case in Petrograd), or if in
    some cases “criticism” of military experts turns into
    direct hindrance to the systematic and persistent work of
    employing them, the Party immediately rectifies, and will rectify,
    such mistakes. 
The chief and principal means of rectifying them is to
    intensify political work in the army and among the mobilised, to
    improve the work of the commissars in the army, to have more
    highly qualified commissars, to raise their level, to have them
    carry out in practice that which the Party Programme
    demands and which only too often is carried out far too
    inadequately, i.e., “the concentration of all-round
    control over the commanders (of the army) in the hands of the
    working class”. Criticism of the military experts by
    outsiders, attempts to correct matters by “lightning
    raids” are too easy, and therefore hopeless and harmful. All
    those who recognise their political responsibility, who take the
    defects of our army to heart, let them join its ranks, either as
    privates or commanders, as political workers or commissars; let
    each work—every Party member will find a place  suited to
    his abilities—inside the army organisation for its
    improvement. 
The Soviet government has long been paying the greatest
    attention to making it possible for workers, and also peasants,
    Communists in particular, to master the art of war in all
    seriousness. This is being done at a number of establishments,
    institutions and courses, but still far too little is being
    done. There is still a lot of room here for personal initiative
    and personal energy. Communists, in particular, should
    persistently study the handling of machine guns, artillery,
    armoured vehicles, etc., for here our backwardness is more
    telling, here the enemy’s superiority,  with his larger
    number of officers, is greater, here it is possible for an
    unreliable military expert to do grave harm, here the role of the
    Communist is important in the extreme. 

 The Fight Against Counter-Revolution In The Rear
    

      Counter-revolution is raising its head in our rear and in our
      midst just as it did in July of last year. 
Counter-revolution has been defeated, but by no means
    destroyed, and is naturally taking advantage of Denikin’s
    victories and of the aggravation of the food shortage. And, as
    always, in the wake of direct and open counter-revolution, in the
    wake of the Black Hundreds and the Cadets, whose strength lies in
    their capital, their direct connections with Entente imperialism,
    and their understanding of the inevitability of dictatorship and
    their ability to exercise it (on Kolchak lines)—in their
    wake follow the wavering, spineless Mensheviks, Right
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who
    embellish their deeds with words. 
There should be no illusions on this score! What is the
    “nutritive medium” which engenders
    counter-revolutionary activities, outbreaks, conspiracies and so
    forth we know full well. The medium is the bourgeoisie, the
    bourgeois intelligentsia, the kulaks in the countryside, and,
    everywhere, the “non-party” public, as well as the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks. We must redouble, we
    must increase tenfold our watch over this medium. We  must
    multiply tenfold our vigilance, because counter-revolutionary
    attempts from this quarter are absolutely inevitable, precisely at
    the present moment and in the near future. For this reason, too,
    repeated attempts to blow up bridges, to foment strikes, to engage
    in every kind of espionage and the like, are natural. All
    precautions of the most intense, systematic, repeated, wholesale
    and unexpected kind are essential in all centres without exception
    where the “nutritive medium” of the
    counter-revolutionaries has the least chance of existing. 
In regard to the Mensheviks and the Right and Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, we must draw a lesson from our most
    recent experience. Among their “periphery”, among the
    public which gravitates towards them, there is an undoubted
    shifting away from Kolchak and Denikin towards Soviet power. We
    have taken cognisance of this shift, and every time it has assumed
    any real shape we, on our part, have taken a step to meet it. This
    policy of ours we shall not change under any circumstances, and
    generally speaking, there will no doubt be an increase in the
    number of “migrants” from the type of Menshevism and
    Socialist-Revolutionarism which leans towards Kolchak and Denikin
    to the type of Menshevism and Socialist-Revolutionarism which
    leans towards Soviet power. 
But at the present juncture the petty-bourgeois democrats,
    headed by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks,
    spineless and wavering as always, are watching to  see which way
    the wind blows, and are swinging in the direction of the victor,
    Denikin. This is especially true of the “political
    leaders” of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries of the
    Mensheviks (of the type of Martov and Co.), of the Right
    Socialist-Revolutionaries (of the type of Chernov and Co.), and of
    their “literary groups” in general, whose members,
    apart from all else, are deeply offended at their political
    bankruptcy, and for whom hazardous ventures against Soviet power,
    therefore, have an attraction that is hardly likely to be
    eradicated. 
We must not allow ourselves to be deceived by the words and
    ideology of their leaders, by their personal integrity or
    hypocrisy. This is important from the standpoint of their
    individual biographies. But it is not important from  the
    standpoint of politics, i.e., of the relations between classes, of
    the relations between millions of people. Martov and Co.,
    “in the name of the Central Committee”, solemnly
    condemn their “activists” and threaten (eternally
    threaten!) to expel them from the party. But this by no means does
    away with the fact that the “activists” are the
    strongest of all among the Mensheviks, hide behind them, and carry
    on their work on behalf of Kolchak and Denikin. Volsky and
    Co. condemn Avksentyev, Chernov and Co., but this does not in the
    least prevent the latter from being stronger than Volsky, nor does
    it prevent Chernov from saying, “If it is not we who are to
    overthrow the Bolsheviks, and not now, then who is, and
    when?” The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries may “work
    independently” without any agreement with the reactionaries,
    with the Chernovs, but actually they are just as much allies of
    Denikin and pawns in his game as the late Left
    Socialist-Revolutionary Muravyov, the ex-commander-in-chief, who
    for “ideological” reasons opened the front to the
    Czechoslovaks and to Kolchak. 
Martov, Volsky and Co. fancy themselves “superior”
    to both contending sides; they fancy themselves capable of
    creating a “third side”. 
This desire, even when it is sincere, still remains the
    illusion of the petty-bourgeois democrat, who to this day, seventy
    years after 1848, has still not learned the most elementary thing,
    namely, that in a capitalist environment only the dictatorship of
    the bourgeoisie or the dictatorship of the proletariat is
    possible, and that no third course can exist. Martov and Co. will
    evidently die with this illusion. That is their affair. And it is
    our affair to remember that in practice vacillations on the part
    of these people are inevitable, today in the direction of Denikin,
    tomorrow in the direction of the Bolsheviks. And today we must do
    the task of this day. 
Our task is to put the question bluntly. What is better? To
    ferret out, to imprison, sometimes even to shoot hundreds of
    traitors from among the Cadets, non-party people, Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, who “come out” (some with
    arms in hand, others with conspiracies, others still with
    agitation against mobilisation, like the Menshevik printers and
    railwaymen, etc.) against Soviet power,  in other
    words, in favour of Denikin ? Or to allow matters to
    reach such a pass that Kolchak and Denikin are able to slaughter,
    shoot and flog to death tens of thousands of workers and peasants?
    The choice is not difficult to make. 
That is how the question stands, and not otherwise. 
Whoever has not yet understood this, whoever is capable of
    whining over the “iniquity” of such a decision, must
    be given up as hopeless and held up to public ridicule and
    shame. 

  The Population Must Be Mobilised 
      For War To A Man
    
 The Soviet Republic is a fortress besieged by world
    capital. We can concede the right to use it as a refuge from
    Kolchak, and the right to live in it generally, only to those who
    take an active part in the war and help us in every way. Hence our
    right and our duty to mobilise the whole population for the war to
    a man, some for army work in the direct meaning of the term,
    others for subsidiary activities of every kind in aid of the
    war. 
To carry this out in full, an ideal organisation is
    required. And since our government organisation is very far from
    perfect (which is not in the least surprising in view of its
    youth, its novelty and the extraordinary difficulties which
    accompany its development), to attempt at once and on a wide scale
    anything complete or even very considerable in this sphere would
    be a most dangerous indulgence in fantastic organisational
    schemes. 
But much can be done in a partial way to bring us nearer to
    this ideal, and the “initiative” shown by our Party
    workers and Soviet officials in this respect is very, very far
    from enough. 
It will suffice here to raise this question and to draw the
    attention of comrades to it. There is no need to give any specific
    instructions or proposals. 
Let us only observe that the petty-bourgeois democrats who
    stand nearest to the Soviets and who call themselves, by force of
    habit, socialists—some of the “Left” Mensheviks
    and the like, for example—are particularly disposed to wax
    indignant at the”barbaric”, in their opinion, practice
    of taking hostages. 
Let them wax indignant, but unless this is done war can not be
    waged, and when the danger grows acute the use of this means must
    be extended and multiplied in every sense. Not infrequently, for
    instance, Menshevik or yellow printers, higher railway employees
    or secret profiteers, kulaks, the wealthy sections of the urban
    (and rural) population and similar elements look upon defence
    against Kolchak and Denikin with an infinitely criminal and
    infinitely brazen attitude of indifference which grows into
    sabotage. Lists of such groups must be drawn up (or they must be
    compelled themselves to form groups in which each answers for
    everybody), and they must not only be put to work digging
    trenches, as is sometimes practised, but assigned to the most
    diverse and comprehensive duties for material aid to the Red
    Army. 
The fields of the Red Army men will be better cultivated, the
    supply of food, tobacco and other necessities to the Red Army men
    will be better arranged, the danger to the lives of thousands upon
    thousands of workers and peasants resulting from a single
    conspiracy, etc., will be considerably reduced if we employ this
    method more widely, more comprehensively and more skilfully.

 “Work In A Revolutionary Way”
    

      Summing up what was said above, we arrive at a simple
      conclusion. What is demanded immediately and in the course of
      the next few months of all Communists, of all class-conscious
      workers and peasants, of everyone who does not want to see
      Kolchak and Denikin win, is an extraordinary accession of
      energy; what is needed is “work in a revolutionary
      way”. 
The starving, exhausted and worn-out Moscow railwaymen, both
      skilled and unskilled, have for the sake of victory over Kolchak
      inaugurated “communist subbotniks”—work
      without pay for several hours a week to continue until victory
      over Kolchak is complete—and have, moreover, developed
      unprecedented labour productivity, exceeding the  usual
      productivity many times over; this goes to show that much, very
      much can still be done. 

    

      And we must do it. 

    

      Then we shall win.

 Comrades, according to the plan you have adopted and which has  been conveyed to me, the subject of today’s talk is the state. I  do not know how familiar you are already with this subject. If  I am not mistaken your courses have only just begun and this is  the first time you will be tackling this subject systematically. If that is so, then it may very well happen that in the first lecture on this difficult subject I may not succeed in making my exposition sufficiently clear and comprehensible to many of my listeners. And if this should prove to be the case, I would request you not to be perturbed by the fact, because the question of the state is a most complex and difficult one, perhaps one that more than any other has been confused by bourgeois scholars, writers and philosophers. It should not therefore be expected that a thorough understanding of this subject can be obtained from one brief talk, at a first sitting. After the first talk on this subject you should make a note of the passages which you have not understood or which are not clear to you, and return to them a second, a third and a fourth time, so that what you have not understood may be further supplemented and elucidated later, both by reading and by  various lectures and talks. I hope that we may manage to meet  once again and that we shall then be able to exchange opinions  on all supplementary questions and see what has remained most  unclear. I also hope that in addition to talks and lectures you  Will devote some time to reading at least a few of the most  important works of Marx and Engels. I have no doubt that these  most important works are to be found in the lists of books and  in the handbooks which are available in your library for the  students of the Soviet and Party school; and although, again,  some of you may at first be dismayed by the difficulty of the  exposition, I must again warn you that you should not let this  worry you; what is unclear at a first reading will become clear  at a second reading, or when you subsequently approach the  question from a somewhat different. angle. For I once more  repeat that the question is so complex and has been so confused  by bourgeois scholars and writers that anybody who desires to  study it seriously and master it independently must attack it  several times, return to it again and again and consider it from  various angles in order to attain a clear, sound understanding  of it. Because it is such a fundamental, such a basic question  in all politics, and because not only in such stormy and  revolutionary times as the present, but even in the most  peaceful times, you will come across it every day in any  newspaper in connection with any economic or political question  it will be all the easier to return to it. Every day, in one  context or another, you will be returning to the question: what  is the state, what is its nature, what is its significance and  what is the attitude of our Party, the party that is fighting  for the overthrow of capitalism, the Communist Party—what is its  attitude to the state? And the chief thing is that you should  acquire, as a result of your reading, as a result of the talks  and lectures you will hear on the state, the ability to approach  this question independently, since you will be meeting with it  on the most diverse occasions, in connection with the most  trifling questions, in the most unexpected contexts and in  discussions and disputes with opponents. Only when you learn to  find your way about independently in this question may you consider yourself sufficiently confirmed in your convictions and able with sufficient success to defend them against anybody and at any time. 
  After these brief remarks, I shall proceed to deal with the  question itself—what is the state, how did it arise and  fundamentally what attitude to the state should be displayed by  the party of the working class, which is fighting for the  complete overthrow of capitalism—the Communist Party? 
  I have already said that you are not likely to find another question which has been so confused, deliberately and unwittingly, by representatives of bourgeois science, philosophy, jurisprudence, political economy and journalism, as the question of the state. To this day it is very often confused with religious questions; not only those professing religious doctrines (it is quite natural to expect it of them), but even people who consider themselves free from religious prejudice, very often confuse the specific question of the state with questions of religion and endeavour to build up a doctrine—very often a complex one, with an ideological, philosophical approach and argumentation—which claims that the state is something  divine, something supernatural, that it is a certain force by  virtue of which mankind has lived, that it is a force of divine  origin which confers on people, or can confer on people, or  which brings with it something that is not of man, but is given  him from without. And it must be said that this doctrine is so  closely bound up with the interests of the exploiting  classes—the landowners and the capitalists—so serves their  interests, has so deeply permeated all the customs, views and  science of the gentlemen who represent the bourgeoisie, that you  will meet with vestiges of it on every hand, even in the view of  the state held by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries,  although they are convinced that they can regard the state with  sober eyes and reject indignantly the suggestion that they are  under the sway of religious prejudices. This question has been  so confused and complicated because it affects the interests of  the ruling classes more than any other question (yielding place  in this respect only to the foundations of economic  science). The doctrine of the state serves to justify social  privilege, the existence of exploitation, the existence of  capitalism—and that is why it would be the greatest mistake to  expect impartiality on this question, to approach it in the  belief that people who claim to be scientific can give you a  purely scientific view on the subject. In the question of the  state, in the doctrine of the state, in the theory of the state,  when you have become familiar with it and have gone into it  deeply enough, you will always discern the struggle between  different classes, a struggle which is reflected or expressed in  a conflict of views on the state, in the estimate of the role   and significance of the state. 
  To approach this question as scientifically as possible we must cast  at least a fleeting glance back on the history of the state, its  emergence and development. The most reliable thing in a question of  social science, and one that is most necessary in order really to  acquire the habit of approaching this question correctly and not  allowing oneself to get lost in the mass of detail or in the immense  variety of conflicting opinion—the most important thing if one is to  approach this question scientifically is not to forget the underlying  historical connection, to examine every question from the standpoint  of how the given phenomenon arose in history and what were the  principal stages in its development, arid, from the standpoint of its development, to examine what it has become today.
I hope that in studying this question of the state you will acquaint yourselves with Engels’s book The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. This is one of the fundamental works of modern socialism, every sentence of which can be accepted with confidence, in the assurance that it has not been said at random but is based on immense historical and political material. Undoubtedly, not all the parts of this work have been expounded in an equally popular and comprehensible way; some of them presume a reader who already possesses a certain knowledge of history and economics. But I again repeat that you should not be perturbed if on reading this work you do not understand it at once. Very few people do. But returning to it later, when your interest has been aroused, you will succeed —in understanding the greater part, if not the whole of it. I refer to this book because it gives the correct approach to the question in the sense mentioned. It begins with a historical sketch of the origin of the state.
This question, like every other—for example, that of the origin of capitalism, the exploitation of man by man, socialism, how socialism arose, what conditions gave rise to it—can be approached soundly and confidently only if we cast a glance back on the history of its development as a whole. In connection with this problem it should first of all be noted that the state has not always existed. There was a time when there was no state. It appears wherever and whenever a division of society into classes appears, whenever exploiters and exploited appear.
Before the first form of exploitation of man by man arose, the first form of division into classes—slave-owners and slaves—there existed the patriarchal family, or, as it is sometimes called, the clan family. (Clan-tribe; at the time people of one kin lived together.) Fairly definite traces of these primitive times have survived in the life of many primitive peoples; and if you take any work whatsoever on primitive civilisation, you will always come across more or less definite descriptions, indications and recollections of the fact that there was a time, more or less similar—to primitive communism, when the division of society into slave-owners and slaves did not exist. And in those times there was no state, no special apparatus for the systematic application of force and the subjugation of people by force. It is such an apparatus that is called the state.
In primitive society, when people lived in small family groups and were still at the lowest stages of development, in a condition approximating to savagery—an epoch from which modern, civilised human society is separated by several thousand years—there were yet no signs of t e existence of a state. We find the predominance of custom, authority, respect, the power enjoyed by the elders of the clan; we find this power sometimes accorded to women the position of women then was not like the downtrodden and oppressed condition of women today—but nowhere do we find a special category of people set apart to rule others and who, for the sake and purpose of rule, systematically and permanently have at their disposal a certain apparatus of coercion, an apparatus of violence, such as is represented at the present time, as you all realise, by armed contingents of troops, prisons and other means of subjugating the will of others by force—all that which constitutes the essence of the state.
If we get away from what are known as religious teachings, from the subtleties, philosophical arguments and various opinions advanced by bourgeois scholars, if we get away from these and try to get at the real core of the matter, we shall find that the state really does amount to such an apparatus of rule which stands outside society as a whole. When there appears such a special group of men occupied solely with government, and who in order to rule need a special apparatus of coercion to subjugate the will of others by force—prisons, special contingents of men, armies, etc.—then there appears the state.
But there was a time when there was no state, when general ties,   the community itself, discipline and the ordering of work were   maintained by force of custom and tradition, by the authority or   the respect enjoyed by the elders of the clan or by women—who in   those times  not only frequently enjoyed a status equal to that   of men, but not infrequently enjoyed an even higher status—and   when there was no special category of persons who were   specialists in ruling. History shows that the state as a special   apparatus for coercing people arose wherever and whenever   there appeared a division of society into classes, that is, a   division into groups of people some of which were permanently in   a position to appropriate the labour of others, where some   people exploited others.   
   And this division of society into classes must always be clearly   borne in mind as a fundamental fact of history. The development   of all human societies for thousands of years, in all countries   without exception, reveals a general conformity to law, a   regularity and consistency; so that at first we had a society   without classes—the original patriarchal, primitive society, in   which there were no aristocrats; then we had a society based on   slavery—a slaveowning society. The whole of modern, civilised   Europe has passed through this stage—slavery ruled supreme two   thousand years ago. The vast majority of peoples of the other   parts of the world also passed through this stage. Traces of   slavery survive to this day among the less developed peoples;   you will find the institution of slavery in Africa, for example,   at the present time. The division into slaveowners and slaves   was the first important class division. The former group not   only owned all the means of production—the land and the   implements, however poor and primitive they may have been in   those times—but also owned people. This group was known as   slave-owners, while those who laboured and supplied labour for   others were known as slaves.
This form was followed in history by another—feudalism. In the great majority of countries slavery in the course of its development evolved into serfdom. The fundamental division of society was now into feudal lords and peasant serfs. The form of relations between people changed. The slave-owners had regarded the slaves as their property; the law had confirmed this view and regarded the slave as a chattel completely owned by the slave-owner. As far as the peasant serf was concerned, class oppression and dependence remained, but it was not considered that the feudal lord owned the peasants as chattels, but that he was only entitled to their labour, to the obligatory performance of certain services. In practice, as you know, serfdom, especially in Russia where it survived longest of all and assumed the crudest forms, in no way differed from slavery.
Further, with the development of trade, the appearance of the world market and the development of money circulation, a new class arose within feudal society—the capitalist class. From the commodity, the exchange of commodities and the rise of the power of money, there derived the power of capital. During the eighteenth century, or rather, from the end of the eighteenth century and during the nineteenth century, revolutions took place all over the world. Feudalism was abolished in all the countries of Western Europe. Russia was the last country in which this took place. In 1861 a radical change took place in Russia as well; as a consequence of this one form of society was replaced by another—feudalism was replaced by capitalism, under which division into classes remained, as well as various traces and remnants of serfdom, but fundamentally the division into classes assumed a different form.
The owners of capital, the owners of the land and the owners of the factories in all capitalist countries constituted and still constitute an insignificant minority of the population who have complete command of the labour of the whole people, and, consequently, command, oppress and exploit the whole mass of labourers, the majority of whom are proletarians, wage-workers, who procure their livelihood in the process of production only by the sale of their own worker’s hands, their labour-power. With the transition to capitalism, the peasants, who had been disunited and downtrodden in feudal times, were converted partly
   (the majority) into proletarians, and partly (the minority)   into   wealthy peasants who themselves hired labourers and who   constituted a rural bourgeoisie.
This fundamental fact—the transition of society from primitive forms of slavery to serfdom and finally to capitalism—you must always bear in mind, for only by remembering this fundamental fact, only by examining all political doctrines placed in this fundamental scheme, will you be able properly to appraise these doctrines and understand what they refer to; for each of these great periods in the history of mankind, slave-owning, feudal and capitalist, embraces scores and hundreds of centuries and presents such a mass of political forms, such a variety of political doctrines, opinions and revolutions, that this extreme diversity and immense variety (especially in connection with the political, philosophical and other doctrines of bourgeois scholars and politicians) can be understood only by firmly holding, as to a guiding thread, to this division of society into classes, this change in the forms of class rule, and from this standpoint examining all social questions—economic, political, spiritual, religious, etc.
If you examine the state from the standpoint of this fundamental   division, you will find that before the division of society into   classes, as I have already said, no state existed. But as the   social division into classes arose and took firm root, as class   society arose, the state also arose and took firm root. The   history of mankind knows scores and hundreds of countries that   have passed or are still passing through slavery, feudalism and   capitalism. In each of these countries, despite the immense   historical changes that have taken place, despite all the   political vicissitudes and all the revolutions due to this   development of mankind, to the transition from slavery through   feudalism to capitalism and to the present world-wide struggle   against capitalism, you will always discern the emergence of the   state. It has always been a certain apparatus which stood   outside society and consisted of a group of people engaged   solely, or almost solely, or mainly, in ruling. People are   divided into the ruled, and into specialists in ruling, those   who rise above society and are called rulers, statesmen. This   apparatus, this group of people who rule others, always   possesses certain means of coercion, of physical force, irrespective of whether this violence over people is expressed in the primitive club, or in more perfected types of weapons in the epoch of slavery, or in the firearms which appeared in the Middle Ages, or, finally, in modern weapons, which in the twentieth century are technical marvels and are based entirely on the latest achievements of modern technology. The methods of violence changed, but whenever there was a state there existed in every society a group of persons who ruled, who commanded, who dominated and who in order to maintain their power possessed an apparatus of physical coercion, an apparatus of violence, with those weapons which corresponded to the technical level of the given epoch. And by examining these general phenomena, by asking ourselves why no state existed when there were no classes, when there were no exploiters and exploited, and why it appeared when classes appeared—only in this way shall we find a definite answer to the question of what is the nature and significance of the state. 
   The state is a machine for maintaining the rule of one class   over another. When there were no classes in society, when,   before the epoch of slavery, people laboured in primitive   conditions of greater equality, in conditions when the   productivity of labour was still at its lowest, and when   primitive man could barely procure the wherewithal for the   crudest and most primitive existence, a special group of people   whose function is to rule and to dominate the rest of society,   had not and could not yet have emerged. Only when the first form   of the division of society into classes appeared, only when   slavery appeared, when a certain class of people, by   concentrating on the crudest forms of agricultural labour, could   produce a certain surplus, when this surplus was not absolutely   essential for the most wretched existence of the slave and   passed into the hands of the slave-owner, when in this way the   existence of this class of slave-owners was secure—then in order   that it might take firm root it was necessary for a state to   appear.
And it did appear—the slave-owning state, an apparatus which gave the slave-owners power and enabled them to rule over the slaves. Both society and the state were then on a much smaller scale than they are now, they possessed incomparably poorer means of communication—the modern means of communication did not then exist. Mountains, rivers and seas were immeasurably greater obstacles than they are now, and the state took shape within far narrower geographical boundaries. A technically weak state apparatus served a state confined within relatively narrow boundaries and with a narrow range of action. Nevertheless,. there did exist an apparatus which compelled the slaves to remain in slavery, which kept one part of society subjugated to and oppressed by another. It is impossible to compel the greater part of society to work systematically for the other part of society without a permanent apparatus of coercion. So long as there were no classes, there was no apparatus of this sort. When classes appeared, everywhere and always, as the division grew and took firmer hold, there also appeared a special institution—the state. The forms of state were extremely varied. As early as the period of slavery we find diverse forms of the state in the countries that were the most advanced, cultured and civilised according to the standards of the time—for example, in ancient Greece and Rome which were based entirely on slavery. At that time there was already a difference between monarchy and republic, between aristocracy and democracy. A monarchy is the power of a single person, a republic is the absence of any non-elected authority; an aristocracy is the power of a relatively small minority, a democracy is the power of the people (democracy in Greek literally means the power of the people). All these differences arose in the epoch of slavery. Despite these differences, the state of the slave-owning epoch was a slave-owning state, irrespective of whether it was a monarchy or a republic, aristocratic or democratic.
In every course on the history of ancient times, in any lecture on this subject, you will hear about the struggle which was waged between the monarchical and republican states. But the fundamental fact is that the slaves were not regarded as human beings—not only were they not regarded as citizens, they were not even regarded as human beings. Roman law regarded them as chattels. The law of manslaughter, not to mention the other laws for the protection of the person, did not extend to slaves. It defended only the slaveowners, who were alone recognised as citizens with full rights. But whether a monarchy was instituted or a republic, it was a monarchy of the slave-owners or a republic of the slave-owners. All rights were enjoyed by the slave-owners, while the slave was a chattel in the eyes of the law; and not only could any sort of violence be perpetrated against a slave, but even the killing of a slave was not considered a crime. Slave-owning republics differed in their internal organisation, there were aristocratic republics and democratic republics. In an aristocratic republic only a small number of privileged persons took part in the elections; in a democratic republic everybody took part but everybody meant only the slave-owners, that is, everybody except the slaves. This fundamental fact must be borne in mind, because it throws more light than any other on the question of the state and clearly demonstrates the nature of the state. 
   The state is a machine for the oppression of one class by   another, a machine for holding in obedience to one class other,   subordinated classes. There are various forms of this   machine. The slave-owning state could be a monarchy, an   aristocratic republic or even a democratic republic. In fact the   forms of government varied extremely, but their essence was   always the same: the slaves enjoyed no rights and constituted an   oppressed class; they were not regarded as human beings. We find   the same thing in the feudal state. 
   The change in the form of exploitation transformed the   slave-owning state into the feudal state. This was of immense   importance. In slave-owning society the slave enjoyed no rights   whatever and was not regarded as a human being; in feudal   society the peasant was bound to the soil. The chief   distinguishing feature of serfdom was that the peasants (and at   that time the peasants constituted the majority; the urban   population was still very small) were considered bound to the   land—this is the very basis of "serfdom". The peasant might work   a definite number of days for himself on the plot assigned to   him by the landlord; on the other days the peasant serf worked   for his lord. The essence of class society remained—society was   based on class exploitation. Only the owners of the land could   enjoy full rights; the peasants had no rights at all. In   practice their condition differed very little from the condition   of slaves in the slave-owning state. Nevertheless, a wider road   was opened for their emancipation, for the emancipation of the   peasants, since the peasant serf was not regarded as the direct   property of the lord. He could work part of his time on his own   plot, could, so to speak, belong to himself to some extent; and   with the wider opportunities for the development of exchange and trade relations the feudal system steadily disintegrated and the scope of emancipation of the peasantry steadily widened. Feudal society was always more complex than slave society. There was a greater development of trade and industry, which even in those days led to capitalism. In the Middle Ages feudalism predominated. And here too the forms of state varied, here too we find both the monarchy and the republic, although the latter was much more weakly expressed. But always the feudal lord was regarded as the only ruler. The peasant serfs were deprived of absolutely all political rights.
Neither under slavery nor under the feudal system could a small minority of people dominate over the vast majority without coercion. History is full of the constant attempts of the oppressed classes to throw off oppression. The history of slavery contains records of wars of emancipation from slavery which lasted for decades. Incidentally, the name "Spartacist" now adopted by the German Communists—the only German party which is really fighting against the yoke of capitalism—was adopted by them because Spartacus was one of the most prominent heroes of one of the greatest revolts of slaves, which took place about two thousand years ago. For many years the seemingly omnipotent Roman Empire, which rested entirely on slavery, experienced the shocks and blows of a widespread uprising of slaves who armed and united to form a vast army under the leadership of Spartacus. In the end they were defeated, captured and put to torture by the slave-owners. Such civil wars mark the whole history of the existence of class society. I have just mentioned an example of the greatest of these civil wars in the epoch of slavery. The whole epoch of feudalism is likewise marked by constant uprisings of the peasants. For example, in Germany in the Middle Ages the struggle between the two classes—the landlords and the serfs—assumed wide proportions and was transformed into a civil war of the peasants against the landowners. You are all familiar with similar examples of repeated uprisings of the peasants against the feudal landowners in Russia.
In order to maintain their rule and to preserve their power, the   feudal lords had to have an apparatus by which they could unite   under their subjugation a vast number of people and subordinate   them to certain laws and regulations; and all these laws   fundamentally amounted to one thing—the maintenance of the power   of the lords over the peasant serfs. And this was the feudal   state, which in Russia, for example, or in quite backward Asiatic countries (where feudalism prevails to this day) differed in form—it was either a republic or a monarchy. When the state was a monarchy, the rule of one person was recognised; when it was —a republic, the participation of the elected representatives of landowning society was in one degree or another recognised—this was in feudal society. Feudal society represented a division of classes under which the vast majority—the peasant serfs—were completely subjected to an insignificant minority—the owners of the land.
The development of trade, the development of commodity exchange,   led to the emergence of a new class—the capitalists. Capital   took shape at the close of the Middle Ages, when, after the   discovery of America, world trade developed enormously, when the   quantity of precious metals increased, when silver and gold   became the medium of exchange, when money circulation made it   possible for individuals to possess tremendous wealth. Silver   and gold were recognised as wealth all over the world. The   economic power of the landowning class declined and the power of   the new class—the representatives of capital—developed. The   reconstruction of society was such that all citizens seemed to   be equal, the old division into slave-owners and slaves   disappeared, all were regarded as equal before the law   irrespective of what capital each owned; whether he owned land   as private property, or was a poor man who owned nothing but his   labour-power—all were equal before the law. The law protects   everybody equally; it protects the property of those who have it   from attack by the masses who, possessing no property,   possessing nothing but their labour-power, grow steadily   impoverished and ruined and become converted into proletarians. Such is capitalist society.
I cannot dwell on it in detail. You will return to this when you   come to discuss the Programme of the Party you will then hear a   description of capitalist society. This society advanced against   serfdom, against the old feudal
 system, under the slogan of liberty. But it was liberty for those who owned property. And when feudalism was shattered, which occurred at the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century—in Russia it occurred later than in other countries, in 1861—the feudal state was then superseded by the capitalist state, which proclaims liberty for the whole people as its slogan, which declares that it expresses the will of the whole people and denies that it is a class state. And here there developed a struggle between the socialists, who are fighting for the liberty of the whole people, and the capitalist state—a struggle which has led to the creation of the Soviet Socialist Republic and which is spreading all over the world.
To understand the struggle that has been started against world capital, to understand the nature of the capitalist state, we must remember that when the capitalist state advanced against the feudal state it entered the fight under the slogan of liberty. The abolition of feudalism meant liberty for the representatives of the capitalist state and served their purpose, inasmuch as serfdom was breaking down and the peasants had acquired the opportunity of owning as their full property the land which they had purchased for compensation or in part by quit-rent—this did not concern the state: it protected property irrespective of its origin, because the state was founded on private property. The peasants became private owners in all the modern, civilised states. Even when the landowner surrendered part of his land to the peasant, the state protected private property, rewarding the landowner by compensation, by letting him take money for the land. The state as it were declared that it would fully preserve private property, and the state accorded it every support and protection. The state recognised the property rights of every merchant, industrialist and manufacturer. And this society, based on private property, on the power of capital, on the complete subjection of the propertyless workers and labouring masses of the peasantry, proclaimed that its rule was based on liberty. Combating feudalism, it proclaimed freedom of property and was particularly proud of the fact that the state had ceased, supposedly, to be a class state.
Yet the state continued to be a machine which helped the capitalists to hold the poor peasants and the working class in subjection. But in outward appearance it was free. It proclaimed universal suffrage, and declared through its champions, preachers, scholars and philosophers, that it was not a class state. Even now, when the Soviet Socialist Republics have begun to fight the state, they accuse us of violating liberty, of building a state based on coercion, on the suppression of some by others, whereas they represent a popular, democratic state. And now, when the world socialist revolution has begun, and when the revolution has succeeded in some countries, when the fight against world capital has grown particularly acute, this question of the state has acquired the greatest importance and has become, one might say, the most burning one, the focus of all present-day political questions and political disputes.
Whichever party we take in Russia or in any of the more civilised countries, we find that nearly all political disputes, disagreements and opinions now centre around the conception of the state. Is the state in a capitalist country, in a democratic republic—especially one like Switzerland or the U.S.A.—in the freest democratic republics, an expression of the popular will, the sum total of the general decision of the people, the expression of the national will, and so forth; or is the state a machine that enables the capitalists of those countries to maintain their power over the working class and the peasantry? That is the fundamental question around which all political disputes all over the world now centre. What do they say about Bolshevism? The bourgeois press abuses the Bolsheviks. You will not find a single newspaper that does not repeat the hackneyed accusation that the Bolsheviks violate popular rule. If our Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in their simplicity of heart (perhaps it is not simplicity, or perhaps it is the simplicity which the proverb says is worse than robbery) think that they discovered and invented the accusation that the Bolsheviks have violated liberty and popular rule, they are ludicrously mistaken. Today every one of the richest newspapers in the richest countries, which spend tens of millions on their distribution and disseminate bourgeois lies and imperialist policy in tens of millions of copies—every one of these newspapers repeats these basic arguments and accusations against Bolshevism, namely, that the U.S.A., Britain and Switzerland are advanced states based on popular rule, whereas the Bolshevik republic is a state of bandits in which
 liberty is unknown, and that the Bolsheviks have violated the idea of popular rule and have even gone so far as to disperse the Constituent Assembly. These terrible accusations against the Bolsheviks are repeated all over the world. These accusations lead us directly to the question—what is the state? In order to understand these accusations, in order to study them and have a fully intelligent attitude towards them, and not to examine them on hearsay but with a firm opinion of our own, we must have a clear idea of what the state is. We have before us capitalist states of every kind and all the theories in defence of them which were created before the war. In order to answer the question properly we must critically examine all these theories and views. 
   I have already advised you to turn for help to Engels’s book The   Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State. This book   says that every state in which private ownership of the land and   means of production exists, in which capital dominates, however   democratic it may be, is a capitalist state, a machine used by   the capitalists to keep the working class and the poor peasants   in subjection; .while universal suffrage, a Constituent   Assembly, a parliament are merely a form, a sort of promissory   note, which does not change the real state of affairs.
The forms of domination of the state may vary: capital manifests its power in one way where one form exists, and in another way where another form exists—but essentially the power is in the hands of capital, whether there are voting qualifications or some other rights or not, or whether the republic is a democratic one or not—in fact, the more democratic it is the cruder and more cynical is the rule of capitalism. One of the most democratic republics in the world is the United States of America, yet nowhere (and those who have been there since 1905 probably know it) is the power of capital, the power of a handful of multimillionaires over the whole of society, so crude and so openly corrupt as in America. Once capital exists, it dominates the whole of society, and no democratic republic, no franchise can change its nature.
The democratic republic and universal suffrage were an immense progressive advance as compared with feudalism; they have enabled the proletariat to achieve its present unity and solidarity, to form those firm and disciplined
 ranks which are waging a systematic struggle against capital. There was nothing even approximately resembling this among the peasant serfs, not to speak of the slaves. The slaves, as we know, revolted, rioted, started civil wars, but they could never create a class-conscious majority and parties to lead the struggle, they could not clearly realise what their aims were, and even in the most revolutionary moments of history they were always pawns in the hands of the ruling classes. The bourgeois republic, parliament, universal suffrage—all represent great progress from the standpoint of the world development of society. Mankind moved towards capitalism, and it was capitalism alone which, thanks to urban culture, enabled the oppressed proletarian class to become conscious of itself and to create the world working-class movement, the millions of workers organised all over the world in parties—the socialist parties which are consciously leading the struggle of the masses. Without parliamentarism, without an electoral system, this development of the working class would have been impossible. That is why all these things have acquired such great importance in the eyes of the broad masses of people. That is why a radical change seems to be so difficult. It is not only the conscious hypocrites, scientists and priests that uphold and defend the bourgeois lie that the state is free and that it is its mission to defend the interests of all; so also do a large number of people who sincerely adhere to the old prejudices and who cannot understand the transition from the old, capitalist society to socialism. Not only people who are directly dependent on the bourgeoisie, not only those who live under the yoke of capital or who have been bribed by capital (there are a large number of all sorts of scientists, artists, priests, etc. , in the service of capital), but even people who are simply under the sway of the prejudice of bourgeois liberty, have taken up arms against Bolshevism all over the world because when the Soviet Republic was founded it rejected these bourgeois lies and openly declared: you say your state is free, whereas in reality, as long as there is private property, your state, even if it is a democratic republic, is nothing but a machine used by the capitalists to suppress the workers, and the freer the state, the more clearly is this expressed. Examples of this are Switzerland in Europe and the United States in America. Nowhere does capital rule so cynically and ruthlessly, and nowhere is it so clearly apparent, as in these countries, although they are democratic republics, no matter how prettily they are painted and notwithstanding all the talk about labour democracy and the equality of all citizens. The fact is that in Switzerland and the United States capital dominates, and every attempt of the workers to achieve the slightest real improvement in their condition is immediately met by civil war. There are fewer soldiers, a smaller standing army, in these countries—Switzerland has a militia and every Swiss has a gun at home, while in America there was no standing army until quite recently and so when there is a strike the bourgeoisie arms, hires soldiery and suppresses the strike; and nowhere is this suppression of the working-class movement accompanied by such ruthless severity as in Switzerland and the U.S.A. , and nowhere does the influence of capital in parliament manifest itself as powerfully as in these countries. The power of capital is everything, the stock exchange is everything, while parliament and elections are marionettes, puppets.... But the eyes of the workers are being opened more and more, and the idea of Soviet government is spreading farther and farther afield, especially after the bloody carnage we have just experienced. The necessity for a relentless war on the capitalists is becoming clearer and clearer to the working class.
Whatever guise a republic may assume, however democratic it may be, if it is a bourgeois republic, if it retains private ownership of the land and factories, and if private capital keeps the whole of society in wage-slavery, that is, if the republic does not carry out what is proclaimed in the Programme of our Party and in the Soviet Constitution, then this state is a machine for the suppression of some people by others. And we shall place this machine in the hands of the class that is to overthrow the power of capital. We shall reject all the old prejudices about the state meaning universal equality—for that is a fraud: as long as there is exploitation there cannot be equality. The landowner cannot be the equal of the worker, or the hungry man the equal of the full man. This machine called the state, before which people bowed in superstitious awe, believing the old tales that it means popular rule, tales which the proletariat declares to be a bourgeois lie—this machine the proletariat will smash. So far we have deprived the capitalists of this machine and have taken it over. We shall use this machine, or bludgeon, to destroy all exploitation. And when the possibility of exploitation no longer exists anywhere in the world, when there are no longer owners of land and owners of factories, and when there is no longer a situation in which some gorge while others starve, only when the possibility of this no longer exists shall we consign this machine to the scrap-heap. Then there will be no state and no exploitation. Such is the view of our Communist Party. I hope that we shall return to this subject in subsequent lectures, return to it again and again.

  Comrades, Red troops have liberated the entire Urals area from Kolchak and have begun the liberation of Siberia. The workers and peasants of the Urals and Siberia are enthusiastically welcoming Soviet power, for it is sweeping away with an iron broom all the landowner and capitalist scum who ground down the people with exactions, humiliations, floggings, and the restoration of tsarist oppression. 
Although we all rejoice at the liberation of the Urals and the entry of the Red troops into Siberia we must not allow ourselves to be lulled into a sense of security. The enemy is still far from being destroyed. He has not even been definitely broken. 
Every effort must be made to drive Kolchak and the Japanese and other foreign bandits out of Siberia, and an even greater effort is needed to destroy the enemy, to prevent him from starting his banditry again and again. 
How is that to be achieved? 
The harrowing experience of the Urals and Siberia, as well as the experience of all countries which have been through the torments of the four years of imperialist war, must not be without its lessons for us. 
Here are the five chief lessons which all workers and peasants, all working people, must draw from this experience so as to ensure themselves against a repetition of the calamities of the Kolchak rule. 
First lesson. In order to defend the power of the workers and peasants from the bandits, that is, from the landowners and capitalists, we need a powerful Red Army. We have proved—not by words but by actual deeds—that we are  capable of creating it, that we have learned to direct it and to defeat the capitalists notwithstanding the lavish assistance in arms and equipment they are receiving from the richest countries in the world. That much the Bolsheviks have proved by actual deeds. All workers and peasants—if they are class-conscious—must place their faith in them, not on the strength of their word (for to believe a man on the strength of his word is foolish), but on the strength of the experience of millions upon millions of people in the Urals and Siberia. It is a most difficult problem to combine two elements—arming the workers and peasants and giving the command to ex-officers, who for the most part sympathise with the landowners and capitalists. It can be solved only given splendid organising ability, strict and conscious discipline, and the confidence of the broad masses in the guiding force, the worker commissars. This most difficult problem the Bolsheviks have solved; cases of treachery on the part of ex-officers are very numerous, nevertheless the Red Army is not only in our hands, but has learned to defeat the generals of the tsar and the generals of Britain, France, and America. 
Consequently, everyone who seriously wishes to rid him self of the rule of Kolchak must devote all his energies, means and ability without reservation to the task of building up and strengthening the Red Army. Obey all the laws on the Red Army and all orders conscientiously and scrupulously, support discipline in it in every way, and help the Red Army, each to the best of his ability—such is the prime, fundamental, and principal duty of every class-conscious worker and peasant who does not want the rule of Kolchak. 
Fear like the plague the unruly guerrilla spirit, the arbitrary actions of isolated detachments and disobedience to the central authorities, for it spells doom as the Urals, Siberia, and the Ukraine have demonstrated. 
He who does not unreservedly and selflessly assist the Red Army, or support order and discipline in it with all his might, is a traitor and treason-monger, a supporter of the rule of Kolchak, and should be shown no mercy. 
With a strong Red Army we shall be invincible. Without a strong army we shall inevitably fall victim to Kolchak, Denikin, and Yudenich. 
Second lesson. The Red Army cannot be strong without large state stocks of grain, for without them it is impossible to move an army freely or to train it properly. Without them we cannot maintain the workers who are producing for the army. 
Every class-conscious worker and peasant must know and remember that the chief reason now that our Red Army successes are not swift and stable enough is precisely the shortage of state stocks of grain. He who does not give his surpluses of grain to the state is helping Kolchak, he is a traitor and betrayer of the workers and peasants and is responsible for the unnecessary death and suffering of tens of thousands of workers and peasants in the Red Army. 
Rogues and profiteers and very ignorant peasants argue in this way—better sell my grain at the open market price, I will get far more for it than the fixed price paid by the state. 
But the whole point is that free sale promotes profiteering; a few get rich, only the wealthy are sated, while the working masses go hungry. We saw that in practice in the richest grain-bearing-districts of Siberia and the Ukraine. 
With the free sale of grain capital triumphs, while labour starves and suffers. 
With the free sale of grain the price rises to thousands of rubles per pood, money loses its value, a handful of profiteers benefit while the people grow poorer. 
With the free sale of grain the government granaries are empty, the army is powerless, industry dies, and the victory of Kolchak and Denikin is inevitable. 
Only the rich, only the worst enemies of the workers’ and peasants’ government are consciously in favour of the free sale of grain. Those who out of ignorance are in favour of the free sale of grain should learn to understand from the example of Siberia and the Ukraine why it means victory for Kolchak and Denikin. 
There are still unenlightened peasants who argue as follows: let the state first give me in exchange for my grain good wares at pre-war prices, then I will give up my surplus grain, otherwise I will not. And by this sort of argument the rogues and supporters of the landowners often hoodwink the unenlightened peasants.
It should not be difficult to understand that the workers’ state which the capitalists completely devastated by four years of a predatory war for the sake of Constantinople, and which the Kolchaks and Denikins are now devastating again by way of revenge with the help of the capitalists of the whole world—it should not be difficult to understand that such a state cannot at this moment supply the peasants with goods, for industry is at a standstill. There is no food, no fuel, no industry. 
Every sensible peasant will agree that the surplus grain must be given to the starving worker as a loan on condition of receiving industrial goods in return. 
That is the way it is now. All class-conscious and sensible peasants, all except the rogues and profiteers will agree that all surplus grain without exception must be turned over to the workers’ state as a loan, because then the state will restore industry and supply industrial goods to the peasants. 
But, we may be asked, will the peasants trust the workers’ state sufficiently to loan their surplus grain to it? 
Our reply is that first, the state gives a bond for the loan in the shape of treasury notes. Secondly, all peasants know by experience that the workers’ state, that is, Soviet power, helps the working people and fights the landowners and capitalists. That is why Soviet power is called workers’ and peasants’ power. Thirdly, the peasants have no other alternative—either they trust the worker or they trust the capitalist; they give their confidence and a loan either to the workers’ state or to the capitalist state. There is no other alternative either in Russia or in any country in the world. The more class-conscious the peasants become, the more firmly they stand by the workers and the more resolute they are in their decision to help the workers’ state in every way so as to make the return of the power of the landowners and capitalists impossible. 
Third lesson. If Kolchak and Denikin are to he completely destroyed the strictest revolutionary order must be maintained, the laws and instructions of the Soviet government must be faithfully observed, and care must be taken that they are obeyed by all. 
Kolchak’s victories in Siberia and the Urals have been a clear example to all of us that the least disorder, the slightest infringement of Soviet laws, the slightest laxity or negligence at once serve to strengthen the landowners and capitalists and make for their victory. For the landowners and capitalists have not been destroyed and do not consider themselves vanquished; every intelligent worker and peasant sees, knows, and realises that they have only been beaten and have gone into hiding, are lying low, very often disguising themselves by a “Soviet” “protective” colouring. Many landowners have wormed their way into state farms, and capitalists into various “chief administrations” and “central boards”, acting the part of Soviet officials; they are watching every step of the Soviet government. waiting for it to make a mistake or show weakness, so as to overthrow it, to help the Czechoslovaks today and Denikin tomorrow. 
Everything must be done to track down these bandits, these landowners and capitalists who are lying low, and to ferret them out, no matter what guise they take, to expose them and punish them ruthlessly, for they are the worst foes of the working people, skilful, shrewd, and experienced enemies who are patiently waiting for an opportune moment to set a conspiracy going; they are saboteurs, who stop at no crime to injure Soviet power. We must be merciless towards these enemies of the working people, towards the landowners, capitalists, saboteurs, and counter-revolutionaries. 
And in order to be able to catch them we must be skilful, careful, and class-conscious, we must watch out most attentively for the least disorder, for the slightest deviation from the conscientious observance of the laws of the Soviet government. The landowners and capitalists are strong not only because of their knowledge and experience and the assistance they get from the richest countries in the world, but also because of the force of habit and the ignorance of the broad masses who want to live in the “good old way” and do not realise how essential it is that Soviet laws be strictly and conscientiously observed. 
The slightest lawlessness, the slightest infraction of Soviet law and order is a loophole the foes of the working people take immediate advantage of, it is a starting-point for Kolchak and Denikin victories. It would be criminal to forget that the Kolchak movement began through some slight  lack of caution in respect of the Czechoslovaks, with insignificant insubordination on the part of certain regiments. 
Fourth lesson. It is criminal to forget not only that the Kolchak movement began with trifles but also that the Mensheviks (”Social-Democrats”) and S.R.s (”Socialist Revolutionaries”) assisted its birth and directly supported it. It is time we learned to judge political parties not by their words, but by their deeds. 
The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries call themselves socialists, but they are actually abettors of the counter-revolutionaries, abettors of the landowners and capitalists. This was proved in practice not only by isolated facts, but by two big periods in the history of the Russian revolution: (1) the Kerensky period, and (2) the Kolchak period. Both times the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, while professing to be “socialists” and “democrats”, actually played the role of abettors of the whiteguards. Are we then going to be so foolish as to believe them now they are suggesting we let them “try again”, and call our permission a “united socialist (or democratic) front”? Since the Kolchak experience, can there still be peasants other than few isolated individuals, who do not realise that a “united front” with the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries means union with the abettors of Kolchak? 
It may be objected that the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have realised their mistake and renounced all alliance with the bourgeoisie. But that is not true. In the first place, the Right Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have not renounced such an alliance, and there is no definite line of demarcation from these “Rights”. There is no such line through the fault of the “Left” Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries; for although they verbally “condemn” their “Rights”, even the best of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, in spite of all they say, are actually powerless compared with them. Secondly, what even the best of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries advocate are actually Kolchak ideas which assist the bourgeoisie and Kolchak and Denikin and help to mask their filthy and bloody capitalist deeds. These ideas are: A people’s government, universal, equal, and direct suffrage, a constituent assembly, freedom of the press, and the like. All over the world we see capitalist republics which justify capitalist rule and wars for the enslavement of colonies precisely by this lie of “democracy”. In our own country we see that Kolchak, Denikin, Yudenich or any other general readily hands out such “democratic” promises. Can we trust a man who on the strength of verbal promises helps a known bandit? The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, all without exception, help known bandits, the world imperialists, using pseudo-democratic slogans to paint their state power, their campaign against Russia, their rule and their policy in bright colours. All the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries offer us an “alliance” on condition that we make concessions to the capitalists and their leaders, Kolchak and Denikin; as, for example, that we “renounce terror” (when we are faced with the terror of the multi-millionaires of the whole Entente, of the whole alliance of the richest countries, that are engineering plots in Russia), or that we open the way for freedom to trade in grain, and so on. What these “conditions” of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries boil down to is this: we, the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, are wavering towards the capitalists, and we want a “united front” with the Bolsheviks, against whom the capitalists taking advantage of every concession are fighting! No, my Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary gentlemen, look no more in Russia for people capable of believing you. In Russia class-conscious workers and peasants now realise that the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries are abettors of the whiteguards—some deliberate and malicious, others unwitting and because of their persistence in their old mistakes, but abettors of the whiteguards nevertheless. 
Fifth lesson. If Kolchak and his rule are to be destroyed and not allowed to recur, all peasants must unhesitatingly make their choice in favour of the workers’ state. Some people (especially the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries—all of them, even the “Lefts” among them) are trying to scare the peasants with the bogey of the “dictatorship of one party”, the Party of Bolsheviks, Communists. 
The peasants have learned from the Kolchak regime not to be
    afraid of this bogey.  

    

  Either the dictatorship (i.e., the iron rule) of the landowners and capitalists, or the dictatorship of the working class. 
There is no middle course. The scions of the aristocracy, intellectualists and petty gentry, badly educated on bad books, dream of a middle course. There is no middle course anywhere in the world, nor can there be. Either the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (masked by ornate Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik phraseology about a people’s government, a constituent assembly, liberties, and the like), or the dictatorship of the proletariat. He who has not learned this from the whole history of the nineteenth century is a hopeless idiot. And we in Russia have all seen how the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries dreamed of a middle course under Kerensky and under Kolchak. 
To whom did these dreams do service? Whom did they assist? Kolchak and Denikin. Those who dream of a middle course are abettors of Kolchak. 
In the Urals and Siberia the workers and peasants had an opportunity of comparing the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie with the dictatorship of the working class. The dictatorship of the working class is being implemented by the Bolshevik Party, the party which as far back as 1905 and even earlier merged with the entire revolutionary proletariat. 
Dictatorship of the working class means that the workers’ state will unhesitatingly suppress the landowners and capitalists and the renegades and traitors who help these exploiters, and will defeat them. 
The workers’ state is an implacable enemy of the landowner and capitalist, of the profiteer and swindler, an enemy of the private ownership of land and capital, an enemy of the power of money. 
The workers’ state is the only loyal friend and helper the working people and the peasantry have. No leaning towards capital but an alliance of the working people to fight it, workers’ and peasants’ power, Soviet power—that is what the “dictatorship of the working class” means in practice. 
The Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries want to scare the peasants with these words. They won’t succeed. After Kolchak, the workers and peasants even in the most remote backwoods realise that these words mean precisely that without which there can be no salvation from Kolchak. 
Down with the waverers, with the spineless people who are erring in the direction of helping capital and have been captivated by the slogans and promises of capital! An implacable fight against capital, and an alliance of the working people, an alliance of the peasants and the working class—that is the last and most important lesson of the Kolchak regime.

## The Example of the Petrograd Workers











The Example of the Petrograd Workers



V. I. Lenin
The Example of the Petrograd Workers[1]

The newspapers have already reported that the
    Petrograd workers have begun the intensive mobilisation and
    dispatch of the best workers to the Southern Front.
Denikin’s capture of Kursk and advance on Orel fully
    explain this energetic action of the Petrograd proletariat, whose
    example must be followed by the workers of other industrial
    centres.
The Denikin gang count on sowing panic in our ranks and making
    us think only of defence, only of the matter in hand. The foreign
    radio shows how zealously the French and British imperialists are
    helping Denikin, how they are helping him with armaments and
    hundreds of millions of rubles. The foreign radio proclaims to the
    whole world that the road to Moscow lies open. That is how the
    capitalists would like to frighten us.
But they will not succeed in frightening us. The deployment of
    our troops has been carefully planned and strictly carried
    out. Our offensive against the chief source of the enemy’s
    strength steadily continues. The victories recently won—the
    capture of 20 guns in the Boguchar area, the capture of the
    village of Veshenskaya—indicate the successful advance of
    our troops to the centre of the Cossack area, which alone enabled
    arid still enables Denikin to organise a serious force. Denikin
    will be smashed as Kolchak has been smashed. They cannot frighten
    us and we shall bring our cause to a victorious conclusion.
The capture of Kursk and the enemy’s advance on Orel
    required the provision of additional forces in order to repel him
    there. By their example the Petrograd workers have shown that they
    have correctly understood this task. Without hiding the dangers
    from ourselves, and without in any way minimising them, we say:
    Petrograd has shown that we do have additional forces. In order to
    repel the attack on Orel and to launch an offensive against Kursk
    and Kharkov, the best proletarians must be mobilised, over and
    above the forces we already have at our disposal. The fall of
    Kursk constitutes a serious danger; never has the enemy been so
    near to Moscow. In addition to the previous army forces, we are
    dispatching new contingents of advanced workers capable of
    changing the mood of the retreating units to ward off this
    danger.
Among our troops in the South, deserters who have returned to
    the ranks occupy a prominent place. Most of them have returned
    voluntarily, under the influence of the propaganda which has
    explained where their duty lies and shown them how serious is the
    threat that the power of the landowners and capitalists will be
    restored. But the deserters do not hold out, they lack staunchness
    and quite often they begin to retreat without fighting.
That is why it is of prime importance to strengthen the army by
    a new influx of proletarian forces. The unstable elements will be
    given strength, morale will be raised, a turning-point will be
    reached. As has continually happened in our revolution, the
    proletariat will support and guide the wavering sections of the
    working population.
For a long time now the Petrograd workers have had to bear much
    greater burdens than the workers of other industrial centres. The
    Petrograd proletariat has suffered more than the proletariat in
    other localities from famine, the perils of war and the withdrawal
    of the best workers for Soviet duties throughout Russia.
Yet we see that there has not been the slightest dejection, not
    the slightest diminution of energy among the Petrograd workers. On
    the contrary, they have become steeled, they have found new
    strength and have brought new fighters to the fore. They are
    excellently fulfilling the duty of a leading contingent, sending
    aid and support where it is most needed.
When such fresh forces go to reinforce units of our army that
    have wavered, the mass of the working people, the soldiers of
    peasant origin obtain new leaders from among their own kind, from
    the more developed, more politically-conscious, and more
    staunch-minded working people. That is why such help to our
    peasant army gives its a decisive superiority over the enemy, for
    in his case it is only landowners’ sons who are sent out to
    strengthen his peasant army, and we know that this
    “strengthening” has ruined Kolchak and will ruin
    Denikin.
Comrade workers! Let all of you set about the new work after
    the example of the Petrograd comrades! More energy for activities
    in the army, more initiative and boldness, more emulation so as to
    equal the Petrograders, and victory will be won by the working
    people, the landowner and capitalist counter-revolution will be
    beaten.
N. Lenin 
P.S. I have just learned that from Moscow also some dozens of
    the most devoted comrades have left for the front. Following
    Petrograd, Moscow has taken action. Following Moscow, all the rest
    should take action.

    This article was written in connection with the beginning of the
    mobilisation of the Petrograd Communists for the front. During the
    foreign military intervention and the Civil War there were a
    number of such mobilisations. Lenin wrote, “We concentrated
    our best Party forces in the Red Army; we mobilised the best of
    our workers; we looked for new forces at the deepest roots of our
    dictatorship” (see present edition, Vol. 33, “How We
    Should Reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’
    Inspection”).
In view of the difficult situation on the
    Southern Front the plenary meeting of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.), held
    September 21 and 26, 1919, resolved to mobilise Communists and
    send the best Party and working-class people to the front. The
    Party Central Committee in its letter published in Bulletin of the
    C.C., R.C.P.(B.) No. 0, September 30, 1919 pointed out that
    Communists should be sent to the front from those institutions
    where they might be replaced by non-party workers, women and
    ex-servicemen disabled in the Civil War. The Communist Party
    appeal met with a warm response among the working people. The
    Petrograd Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) decided to mobilise 1,200
    Communists for the Southern Front. That same day the first group
    of mobilised Petrograd Communists left for the front, the second
    group on the following day and the third on October
    2. Mobilisation continued during the following days. On October 2,
    Lenin sent a telegram of greetings to the Petrograd work- ers in
    which he praised them for energetic measures in rendering
    assistance to the Southern Front. Between September and November
    the Petrograd Party organisation dispatched for the front over
    4,000 Communists, of whom 1,800 were assigned to leading posts in
    the army.

Results of Party Week in Moscow and Our Tasks


Written: 21 October, 1919

During Party Week in Moscow, 13,600 people
    were enrolled in the Party.
This is a huge, quite unexpected success. The entire
    bourgeoisie, and especially the urban petty bourgeoisie, including
    the specialists, officials and office workers who lament the loss
    of their privileged ‘ruling’ position—all these
    gentlemen have recently, particularly during Party Week in Moscow,
    been doing their best to sow panic and to prophesy the imminent
    collapse of Soviet power and the imminent victory of Denikin.
And with what consummate artistry this
    “intellectualist” public wields the weapon of sowing
    panic! And it has indeed become a real weapon in the class
    struggle of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat. In periods
    such as the one we are passing through, the petty bourgeoisie
    merges in “one reactionary mass” with the bourgeoisie
    and “passionately” seizes on this weapon.
It is Moscow, where the trading element was especially strong,
    where there was a greater concentration of exploiters, landowners,
    capitalists and rentiers than anywhere else, where capitalist
    development brought together a mass of bourgeois intellectuals,
    where the central state administration produced an especially
    large body of officials-it is Moscow that has furnished an
    exceptionally convenient field for bourgeois tittle-tattle,
    bourgeois malicious talk and bourgeois panic-sowing. The
    successful offensive of Denikin and Yudenich was a
    “factor” that favoured to an extraordinary extent the
    “successes” of this bourgeois weapon.
And yet, when the mass of the proletarians saw Denikin’s
    “successes” and realised all the difficulties, burdens
    and dangers attaching to the title and duties of a Communist at
    the present time, thousands and thousands of them rose up to
    reinforce the Party of Communists, to undertake the incredibly
    heavy burden of state administration.
The success of Soviet power, the success of our Party, is truly
    remarkable!
This success has proved and vividly demonstrated to the people
    of the capital, and then to the whole Republic and the whole
    world, that it is in the proletarian milieu, among the genuine
    representatives of the working people, that the most reliable
    source of the strength and durability of Soviet power is to be
    found. This successful voluntary enrolment in the Party at a time
    of maximum difficulty and danger is a real demonstration of
    that aspect of the dictatorship of the proletariat which its
    enemies, in their malice, refuse to see but which is valued above
    all by the real friends of the emancipation of labour from the
    capitalist yoke, namely, the special strength of the
    moral (in the best sense of the word) influence of the
    proletariat (which wields state power) on the masses, the
    ways this influence is exerted.
With state power in their hands, the foremost sections of the
    proletariat have by their example shown the mass of the working
    people, shown them throughout two whole years (an immense period
    for our exceptionally rapid tempo of political development), a
    model of such devotion to the interests of the working
    people, such vigour in the struggle against the enemies of the
    working people (against the exploiters in general and against
    “property-owners” and profiteers in particular), such
    firmness in difficult moments, such self-sacrificing resistance to
    the bandits of world imperialism, that the strength of the
    workers’ and peasants’ sympathy for their
    vanguard has proved by itself capable of performing
    miracles.
 It is indeed a miracle. Workers, who have suffered
    unprecedented torments of hunger, cold, economic ruin and
    devastation, are not only maintaining their cheerful spirit, their
    entire devotion to Soviet power, all the energy of self-sacrifice
    and heroism, but also, despite their lack of training and
    experience, are undertaking the burden of steering the ship of
    state! And this at a moment when the storm has reached the peak of
    its fury ....
The history of our proletarian revolution is full of such
    miracles. They will lead, surely and inevitably, no matter what
    severe trials may be in store, to the full victory of the world
    Soviet republic.
We must take care now that proper use is made of the
    new Party members, Particularly great attention must be devoted to
    this task, for it is not an easy one; it is a new task and cannot
    be accomplished by old routines.
Capitalism stifled, suppressed and killed a wealth of talent
    among the workers and working peasants. These talents perished
    under the oppression of want, poverty and the outrage of human
    dignity. It is our duty now to bring out these talents and put
    them to work. The new members who have joined the Party during
    Party Week are undoubtedly for the most part inexperienced arid
    ignorant in matters of state administration. Equally undoubtedly
    these are most devoted, most sincere and capable people from the
    sections of society that capitalism artificially held
    down, reduced to the lowest level and did not allow to
    rise. Among them, however, there is more strength,
    vigour, staunchness, directness and sincerity than among other
    sections.
It follows that all Party organisations must give especial
    thought to the employment of these new Party members. They must be
    more boldly given the most varied kinds of state work,
    they must be tested in practice as rapidly as possible.
Boldness, of course, must not be taken to mean that the new
    members are to be entrusted at once with responsible
    posts requiring knowledge they do not possess. We must be bold in
    combating red tape: not for nothing has our Party Programme very
    definitely raised the question of the causes of a certain revival
    of bureaucratic methods and indicated methods of combating it. We
    must be bold in establishing, first of all, supervision
    over office workers, officials and specialists by new Party
    members who are well acquainted with the condition of the people,
    their needs and requirements. We must be bold in
    immediately affording these new members opportunities for
    developing and displaying their abilities in work on a broad
    scale. We must be bold in breaking with customary routine
    (among us too-quite often, alasi-there is an excessive fear of
    encroaching on established Soviet routine, although sometimes the
    “establishing” has been done not by class-conscious
    Communists, but by old officials and office workers); we must be
    bold in the sense that we must be prepared with revolutionary
    speed to alter the form of work for new Party members so as to
    test them more quickly and to find the appropriate place for
    them.
In many cases new Party members can be given posts where, in
    the course of checking up the conscientiousness with which old
    officials perform their tasks, these Party members will quickly
    learn the job themselves and he able to take it over
    independently. In other cases they can be placed so as to renovate
    and refresh the intermediary links between the mass of workers and
    peasants on the one hand, and the state apparatus on the other. In
    our industrial “chief administrations and central
    boards”, in our agricultural “state farms” there
    are still many, far too many, saboteurs, landowners and
    capitalists in hiding, who harm Soviet power in every
    way. Experienced Party workers in the centre and the localities
    should show their efficiency through their ability to make
    intensive use of the new Party forces for a determined fight
    against this evil.
The Soviet Republic must become a single armed camp where,
    there is a maximum of effort, a maximum economy of forces, a
    maximum reduction of all red tape and unnecessary formalism and a
    maximum simplification of the apparatus which must be not only as
    close as possible to the needs of the masses, but also something
    they can readily understand and participate in independently.
Increased mobilisation of old Party members for army work is
    taking place. This activity must not be weakened in any way, but
    more and more intensified. At the same time, however and with the
    aim of achieving success in the war, we must improve, simplify and
    revitalise our civil administration.
Victory in war goes to the side whose people has greater
    reserves, greater sources of strength and greater endurance.
We have more of all these qualities than the Whites, more than
    the “all-powerful” Anglo-French imperialism, this
    colossus with feet of clay. We have more of them because we can
    draw, and for a long time will continue to draw, more and more
    deeply upon the workers and working peasants, upon those classes
    which were oppressed by capitalism and which everywhere form the
    overwhelming majority of the population. We can draw from this
    most capacious reservoir, for it gives us leaders of the workers
    and peasants in the building of socialism who are the most
    sincere, the most steeled by the burdens of life, the closest to
    the workers and peasants.
Our enemies, whether the Russian or the world bourgeoisie, have
    nothing remotely resembling this reservoir; the ground is more and
    more giving way under their feet; they are being deserted by ever
    greater number of their former supporters among the workers and
    peasants.
That is why, in the last analysis, the victory of Soviet power
    throughout the world is certain and inevitable.

 Economics And Politics In The Era
 Of The Dictatorship Of The Proletariat

I had intended to write a short pamphlet on the subject
    indicated in the title on the occasion of the second anniversary
    of Soviet power. But owing to the rush of everyday work I have so
    far been unable to get beyond preliminary preparations for some of
    the sections. I have therefore decided to essay a brief,
    summarised exposition of what, in my opinion, are the most
    essential ideas on the subject. A summarised exposition, of
    course, possesses many disadvantages and
    shortcomings. Nevertheless, a short magazine article may perhaps
    achieve the modest aim in view, which is to present the problem
    and the groundwork for its discussion by the Communists of various
    countries.
1
Theoretically, there can be no doubt that between capitalism
    and communism there lies a definite tranition period which must
    combine the features and properties of both these forms of social
    economy. This transition period has to be a period of struggle
    between dying capitalism and nascent communism—or, in other
    words, between capitalism which has been defeated but not
    destroyed and communism which has been born but is still very
    feeble. 
 The necessity for a whole historical era distinguished by
    these transitional features should be obvious not only to
    Marxists, but to any educated person who is in any degree
    acquainted with the theory of development. Yet all the talk on the
    subject of the transition to socialism which 


      we hear from present-day petty-bourgeois democrats (and such, in
      spite of their spurious socialist label, are all the leaders of
      the Second International, including such individuals as
      MacDonald, Jean Longuet, Kautsky and Friedrich Adler) is marked
      by complete disregard of this obvious truth. Petty-bourgeois
      democrats are distinguished by an aversion to class struggle, by
      their dreams of avoiding it, by their efforts to smooth over, to
      reconcile, to remove sharp corners. Such democrats, therefore,
      either avoid recognising any necessity for a whole historical
      period of transition from capitalism to communism or regard it
      as their duty to concoct schemes for reconciling the two
      contending forces instead of leading the struggle of one of
      these forces. 
2
In Russia, the dictatorship of the proletariat must inevitably
    differ in certain particulars from what it would be in the
    advanced countries, owing to the very great backwardness and
    petty-bourgeois character of our country. But the basic
    forces—and the basic forms of social economy— are the
    same in Russia as in any capitalist country, so that the
    peculiarities can apply only to what is of lesser importance. 
 The basic forms of social economy are capitalism, petty
    commodity production, and communism. The basic forces are the
    bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie (the peasantry in particular)
    and the proletariat. 
 The economic system of Russia in the era of the dictatorship
    of the proletariat represents the struggle of labour, united on
    communist principles on the scale of a vast state and making its
    first steps—the struggle against petty commodity production
    and against the capitalism which still persists and against that
    which is newly arising on the basis of petty commodity
    production. 
 In Russia, labour is united communistically insofar as, first,
    private ownership of the means of production has been abolished,
    and, secondly, the proletarian state power is organising
    large-scale production on state-owned land and in state-owned
    enterprises on a national scale, is distributing labour-power
    among the various branches of production and the various
    enterprises, and is distributing among the working people large
    quantities of articles of consumption belonging to the state. 
 We speak of “the first steps” of communism in
    Russia (it is also put that way in our Party Programme adopted in
    March 1919), because all these things have been only partially
    effected in our country, or, to put it differently, their
    achievement is only in its early stages. We accomplished
    instantly, at one revolutionary blow, all that can, in general, be
    accomplished instantly; on the first day of the dictatorship of
    the proletariat, for instance, on October 26 (November 8),1917,
    the private ownership of land was abolished without compensation
    for the big landowners— the big landowners were
    expropriated. Within the space of a few months practically all the
    big capitalists, owners of factories, joint-stock companies,
    banks, railways, and so forth, were also expropriated without
    compensation. The state organisation of large-scale production in
    industry and the transition from “workers’
    control” to “workers’ management” of
    factories and railways— this has, by and large, already been
    accomplished; but in relation to agriculture it has only just
    begun ("state farms”, i.e., large farms organised by the
    workers’ state on state owned land). Similarly, we have only
    just begun the organisation of various forms of co-operative
    societies of small farmers as a transition from petty commodity
    agriculture to communist agriculture.[1] The same must be said
    of the state-organised distribution of products in place-of
    private trade, i.e., the state procurement and delivery of grain
    to the cities and of industrial products to the
    countryside. Available statistical data on this subject will be
    given below. 
 Peasant farming continues to be petty commodity
    production. Here we have an extremely broad and very sound,
    deep-rooted basis for capitalism, a basis on which capitalism
    persists or arises anew in a bitter struggle against
    communism. The forms of this struggle are private speculation and
    profiteering versus state procurement of grain (and other
    products) and state distribution of products in general. 
3
To illustrate these abstract theoretical propositions, let us
    quote actual figures. 
 According to the figures of the People’ s Commissariat
    of Food, state procurements of grain in Russia between August 1,
    1917, and August 1, 1918, amounted to about 30,000,000 poods, and
    in the following year to about 110,000,000 poods. During the first
    three months of the next campaign (1919-20) procurements will
    presumably total about 45,000,000 poods, as against 37,000,000
    poods for the same period (August-October) in 1918. 
 These flgures speak clearly of a slow but steady improvement
    in the state of affairs from the point of view of the victory of
    communism over capitalism. This improvement is being achieved in
    spite of difficulties without world parallel, difficulties due to
    the Civil War organised by Russian and foreign capitalists who are
    harnessing all the forces of the world’s strongest
    powers. 
 Therefore, in spite of the lies and slanders of the
    bourgeoisie of all countries and of their open or masked henchmen
    (the “socialists” of the Second International), one
    thing remains beyond dispute—as far as the basic economic
    problem of the dictatorship of the proletariat is concerned, the
    victory of communism over capitalism in our country is
    assured. Throughout the world the bourgeoisie is raging and fuming
    against Bolshevism and is organising military expeditions, plots,
    etc., against the Bolsheviks, because it realises full well that
    our success in reconstructing the social economy is inevitable,
    provided we are not crushed by military force. And its attempts to
    crush us in this way are not succeeding. 
 The extent to which we have already vanquished capitalism in
    the short time we have had at our disposal, and despite the
    incredible difficulties under which we have had to work, will be
    seen from the following summarised figures.

    The Central Statistical Board has just prepared for the press
    data on the production and consumption of grain—not for the
    whole of Soviet Russia, but only for twenty-six gubernias. 
 The results are as follows:



26 gubernias of Soviet Russia

Population in millions

Production of grain (excluding seed and fodder) millions poods
 Grain delivered, millions poods

Total amount of grain at disposal of population millions poods

Grain consumption, poods per capita

      Thus, approximately half the amount of grain supplied to the
      cities is provided by the Commissariat of Food and the other
      half by profiteers. This same proportion is revealed by a
      careful survey, made in 1918, of the food consumed by city
      workers. It should be borne in mind that for bread supplied by
      the state the worker pays one-ninth of what he pays the
      profiteer. The profiteering price for bread is ten
      times greater than the state price; this is revealed by a
      detailed study of workers’ budgets.

A careful study of the figures quoted shows that they present
    an exact picture of the fundamental features of Russia’s
    present-day economy. 
 The working people have been emancipated from their age-old
    oppressors and exploiters, the landowners and capitalists. This
    step in the direction of real freedom and real equality, a step
    which for its extent, dimensions and  rapidity is without parallel
    in the world, is ignored by the supporters of the bourgeoisie
    (including the petty-bourgeois democrats), who, when they talk of
    freedom and equality, mean parliamentary bourgeois democracy,
    which they falsely declare to be “democracy” in
    general, or “pure democracy” (Kautsky). 
 But the working people are concerned only with real equality
    and real freedom (freedom from the landowners and capitalists),
    and that is why they give the Soviet government such solid
    support. 
 In this peasant country it was the peasantry as a whole who
    were the first to gain, who gained most, and gained immediately
    from the dictatorship of the proletariat. The peasant in Russia
    starved under the landowners and capitalists. Throughout the long
    centuries of our history, the peasant never had an opportunity to
    work for himself: he starved while handing over hundreds of
    millions of poods of grain to the capitalists, for the cities and
    for export. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat the peasant
    for the first time has been working for himself and
    feeding better than the city dweller. For the first time
    the peasant has seen real freedom—freedom to eat his bread,
    freedom from starvation. In the distribution of the land, as we
    know, the maximum equality has been established; in the vast
    majority of cases the peasants are dividing the land according to
    the number of “mouths to feed”. 
 Socialism means the abolition of classes. 
 In order to abolish classes it is necessary, first, to
    overthrow the landowners and capitalists. This part of our task
    has been accomplished, but it is only a part, and moreover,
    not the most difficult part. In order to abolish classes
    it is necessary, secondly, to abolish the difference between
    factory worker and peasant, to make workers of all of
    them. This cannot be done all at once. This task is
    incomparably more difficult and will of necessity take a long
    time. It is not a problem that can be solved by overthrowing a
    class. It can be solved only by the organisational reconstruction
    of the whole social economy, by a transition from individual,
    disunited, petty commodity production to large-scale social
    production. This transition must of necessity be extremely
    protracted. It may only be delayed and complicated by hasty and
    incautious administrative and legislative measures. It can be
    accelerated only by affording such assistance to the peasant as
    will enable him to effect an immense improvement in his whole
    farming technique to reform it radically. 
 In order to solve the second and most difficult part of the
    problem, the proletariat, after having defeated the bourgeoisie,
    must unswervingly conduct its policy towards the peasantry along
    the following fundamental lines. The proletariat must separate,
    demarcate the working peasant from the peasant owner, the peasant
    worker from the peasant huckster, the peasant who labours from the
    peasant who profiteers. 
 In this demarcation lies the whole essence of
    socialism. 
 And it is not surprising that the socialists who are
    socialists in word but petty-bourgeois democrats in deed (the
    Martovs, the Chernovs, the Kautskys and others) do not understand
    this essence of socialism. 
 The demarcation we here refer to is an extremely difficult
    one, because in real life all the features of the
    “peasant”, however diverse they may be, however
    contradictory they may be, are fused into one whole. Nevertheless,
    demarcation is possible; and not only is it possible, it
    inevitably follows from the conditions of peasant farming and
    peasant life. The working peasant has for ages been oppressed by
    the landowners, the capitalists, the hucksters and profiteers and
    by their state, including even the most democratic
    bourgeois republics. Throughout the ages the working peasant has
    trained himself to hate and loathe these oppressors and
    exploiters, and this “training”, engendered by the
    conditions of life, compels the peasant to seek an
    alliance with the worker against the capitalist and against the
    profiteer and huckster. Yet at the same time, economic conditions,
    the conditions of commodity production, inevitably turn the
    peasant (not always, but in the vast majority of cases) into a
    huckster and profiteer. 
 The statistics quoted above reveal a striking difference
    between the working peasant and the peasant profiteer. That
    peasant who during 1918-19 delivered to the hungry workers of the
    cities 40,000,000 poods of grain at fixed state prices, who
    delivered this grain to the state agencies despite all the
    shortcomings of the latter, shortcomings fully realised by the
    workers’ government, but which were unavoidable in the first
    period of the transition to socialism—that peasant is a
    working peasant, the comrade and equal of the socialist worker,
    his most faithful ally, his blood brother in the fight against the
    yoke of capital. Whereas that peasant who clandestinely sold
    40,000,000 poods of grain at ten times the state price, taking
    advantage of the need and hunger of the city worker, deceiving the
    state, and everywhere increasing and creating deceit, robbery and
    fraud—that peasant is a profiteer, an ally of the
    capitalist, a class enemy of the worker, an exploiter. For whoever
    possesses surplus grain gathered from land belonging to the whole
    state with the help of implements in which in one way or another
    is embodied the labour not only of the peasant but also of the
    worker and so on— whoever possesses a surplus of grain and
    profiteers in that grain is an exploiter of the hungry
    worker. 
 You are violators of freedom, equality, and
    democracy—they shout at us on all sides, pointing to the
    inequality of the worker and the peasant under our Constitution,
    to the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, to the forcible
    confiscation of surplus grain, and so forth. We reply—never
    in the world has there been a state which has done so much to
    remove the actual inequality, the actual lack of freedom from
    which the working peasant has been suffering for centuries. But we
    shall never recognise equality with the peasant profiteer, just as
    we do not recognise “equality” between the exploiter
    and the exploited, between the sated and the hungry, nor the
    “freedom” for the former to rob the latter. And those
    educated people who refuse to recognise this difference we shall
    treat as whiteguards, even though they may call themselves
    democrats, socialists, internationalists, Kautskys, Chernovs, or
    Martovs. 
5
Socialism means the abolition of classes. The dictatorship of
    the proletariat has done all it could to abolish classes. But
    classes cannot be abolished at one stroke.
 And classes still remain and will remain in
    the era of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The dictatorship
    will become unnecessary when classes disappear. Without the
    dictatorship of the proletariat they will not disappear. 
 Classes have remained, but in the era of the dictatorship of
    the proletariat every class has undergone a change, and
    the relations between the classes have also changed. The class
    struggle does not disappear under the dictatorship of the
    proletariat; it merely assumes different forms. 
 Under capitalism the proletariat was an oppressed class, a
    class which had been deprived of the means of production, the only
    class which stood directly and completely opposed to the
    bourgeoisie, and therefore the only one capable of being
    revolutionary to the very end. Having overthrown the bourgeoisie
    and conquered political power, the proletariat has become the
    ruling class; it wields state power, it exercises control
    over means of production already socialised; it guides the
    wavering and intermediary elements and classes; it crushes the
    increasingly stubborn resistance of the exploiters. All these are
    specific tasks of the class struggle, tasks which the
    proletariat formerly did not and could not have set itself. 
 The class of exploiters, the landowners and capitalists, has
    not disappeared and cannot disappear all at once under the
    dictatorship of the proletariat. The exploiters have been smashed,
    but not destroyed. They still have an inter national base in the
    form of international capital, of which they are a branch. They
    still retain certain means of production in part, they still have
    money, they still have vast social connections. Because they have
    been defeated, the energy of their resistance has increased a
    hundred and a thousandfold. The “art” of state,
    military and economic administration gives them a superiority, and
    a very great superiority, so that their importance is incomparably
    greater than their numerical proportion of the population. The
    class struggle waged by the overthrown exploiters against the
    victorious vanguard of the exploited, i.e., the proletariat, has
    become incomparably more bitter. And it cannot be otherwise in the
    case of a revolution, unless this concept is replaced (as it is by
    all the heroes of the Second International) by reformist
    illusions. 
 Lastly, the peasants, like the petty bourgeoisie in general,
    occupy a half-way, intermediate position even under the
    dictatorship of the proletariat: on the one hand, they are a
    fairly large (and in backward Russia, a vast) mass of working
    people, united by the common interest of all working people to
    emancipate themselves from the landowner and the capitalist; on
    the other hand, they are disunited small proprietors,
    property-owners and traders. Such an economic position inevitably
    causes them to vacillate between the proletariat and the
    bourgeoisie. In view of the acute form which the struggle between
    these two classes has assumed, in view of the incredibly severe
    break up of all social relations, and in view of the great
    attachment of the peasants and the petty bourgeoisie generally to
    the old, the routine, and the unchanging, it is only natural that
    we should inevitably find them swinging from one side to the
    other, that we should find them wavering, changeable, uncertain,
    and so on. 
 In relation to this class—or to these social
    elements—the proletariat must strive to establish its
    influence over it, to guide it. To give leadership to the
    vacillating and unstable—such is the task of the
    proletariat. 
 If we compare all the basic forces or classes and their
    interrelations, as modified by the dictatorship of the
    proletariat, we shall realise how unutterably nonsensical and
    theoretically stupid is the common petty-bourgeois idea shared by
    all representatives of the Second International, that the
    transition to socialism is possible “by means of
    democracy” in general. The fundamental source of this error
    lies in the prejudice inherited from the bourgeoisie that
    “democracy” is something absolute and above
    classes. As a matter of fact, democracy itself passes into an
    entirely new phase under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and
    the class struggle rises to a higher level, dominating over each
    and every form. 
 General talk about freedom, equality and democracy is in fact
    but a blind repetition of concepts shaped by the relations of
    commodity production. To attempt to solve the concrete problems of
    the dictatorship of the proletariat by such generalities is
    tantamount to accepting the theories and principles of the
    bourgeoisie in their entirety.

    From the point of view of the proletariat, the question can be
    put only in the following way: freedom from oppression by which
    class? equality of which class with which? democracy based on
    private property, or on a struggle for the abolition of private
    property?—and so forth. 
Long ago Engels in his Anti-Dühring explained
    that the concept “equality” is moulded from the
    relations of commodity production; equality becomes a prejudice if
    it is not understood to mean the abolition of
    classes. This elementary truth regarding the distinction
    between the bourgeois-democratic and the socialist conception of
    equality is constantly being forgotten. But if it is not forgotten
    it becomes obvious that by overthrowing the bourgeoisie the
    proletariat takes the most decisive step towards the abolition of
    classes, and that in order to complete the process the proletariat
    must continue its class struggle, making use of the apparatus of
    state power and employing various methods of combating,
    influencing and bringing pressure to bear on the overthrown
    bourgeoisie and the vacillating petty bourgeoisie.

Comrades, I am very glad of the opportunity to
    greet this Congress of Communist comrades representing Moslem
    organisations of the East, and to say a few words about the
    situation now obtaining in Russia and throughout the world. The
    subject of my address is current affairs, and it seems to me that
    the most essential aspects of this question at present are the
    attitude of the peoples of the East to imperialism, and the
    revolutionary movement among those peoples. It is self-evident
    that this revolutionary movement of the peoples of the East can
    now develop effectively, can reach a successful issue, only in
    direct association with the revolutionary struggle of our Soviet
    Republic against international imperialism. Owing to a number of
    circumstances, among them the backwardness of Russia and her vast
    area, and the fact that she constitutes a frontier between Europe
    and Asia, between the West and the East, we had to bear the whole
    brunt-and we regard that as a great honour of being the pioneers
    of the world struggle against imperialism. Consequently, the whole
    course of development in the immediate future presages a still
    broader and more strenuous struggle against international
    imperialism, arid will inevitably be linked with the struggle of
    the Soviet Republic against the forces of united imperialism-of
    Germany, France, Britain and the U.S.A. 

    

      As regards the military
    aspect of the matter, you know how favourable our situation now is
    on all the fronts. I shall not dwell in detail on this question; I
    shall only say that the Civil War which was forced upon us by
    international imperialism has in two years inflicted incalculable
    hardship upon the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic,
    and imposed upon the peasants and workers a burden so intolerable
    that it often seemed they would not be able to endure it. But at
    the same time, because of its brute violence, because of the
    ruthlessly brutal onslaught of our so-called allies, turned wild
    beasts, who robbed us even before the socialist revolution, this
    war has performed a miracle and turned people weary of fighting
    and seemingly incapable of bearing another war into warriors who
    have not only withstood the war for two years but are bringing it
    to a victorious end. The victories we are now gaining over
    Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin signify the advent of a new phase in
    the history of the struggle of world imperialism against the
    countries and nations which have risen up to fight for their
    emancipation. In this respect, the two years of our Civil War have
    fully confirmed what has long been known to historythat the
    character of a war and its success depend chiefly upon the
    internal regime of the country that goes to war, that war is a
    reflection of the internal policy conducted by the given country
    before the war. All this is inevitably reflected in the
    prosecution of a war.
Which class waged the war, and is continuing to wage it, is a
    very important question. Only due to our Civil War being waged by
    workers and peasants who have emancipated themselves, and to its
    being a continuation of the political struggle for the
    emancipation of the working people from the capitalists of their
    own country and of the whole world-only thanks to this were people
    to be found in such a backward country as Russia, worn out as she
    was by four years of imperialist war, who were strong-willed
    enough to carry on that war during two years of incredible and
    unparalleled hardship and difficulty.
This was very strikingly illustrated in the history of the
    Civil War in the case of Kolchak. Kolchak was an enemy who had the
    assistance of all the world’s strongest powers; he had a
    railway which was protected by some hundred thousand foreign
    troops, including the finest troops of the world imperialists,
    such as the Japanese, for example, who had been trained for the
    imperialist war, but took practically no part in it and therefore
    suffered little; Kolchak had the backing of the Siberian peasants,
    who were the most prosperous and had never known serfdom, and
    therefore, naturally, were farthest of all from communism. It
    seemed that Kolchak was an invincible force, because his troops
    were the advance guard of international imperialism. To this day,
    Japanese and Czechoslovak troops and the troops of a number of
    other imperialist nations are operating in Siberia. Nevertheless,
    the more than a year’s experience of Kolchak’s rule
    over Siberia and her vast natural resources, which was at first
    supported by the socialist parties of the Second International, by
    the Mensheviks and the SocialistRevolutionaries, who set up the
    Constituent Assembly Committee front, and which therefore, under
    these conditions, from the standpoint of the man in the street and
    of the ordinary course ofhistory, appeared to be firm and
    invincible that experience actually revealed the following. The
    farther Kolchak advanced into the heart of Russia, the more he
    wore himself out, and in the end we have witnessed Soviet
    Russia’s complete triumph over Kolchak. Here we undoubtedly
    have practical proof that the united forces of workers and
    peasants who have been emancipated from the capitalist yoke can
    perform real miracles. Here we have practical proof that when a
    revolutionary war really does attract and interest the working and
    oppressed people, when it makes them conscious that they are
    fighting the exploiters-such a revolutionary war engenders the
    strength and ability to perform miracles.
I think that what the Red Army has accomplished, its struggle,
    and the history of its victory, will be of colossal, epochal
    significance for all the peoples of the East. It will show them
    that, weak as they may be, and invincible as may seem the power of
    the European oppressors, who in the struggle employ all the
    marvels of technology and of the military art-nevertheless, a
    revolutionary war waged by oppressed peoples, if it really
    succeeds in arousing the millions of working and exploited people,
    harbours such potentialities, such miracles, that the emancipation
    of the peoples of the East is now quite practicable, from the
    standpoint not only of the prospects of the international
    revolution, but also of the direct military experience acquired in
    Asia, in Siberia, the experience of the Soviet Republic, which has
    suffered the armed invasion of all the powerful imperialist
    countries.
Furthermore, the experience of the Civil War in Russia has
    shown us and the Communists of all countries that, in the crucible
    of civil war, the development of revolutionary enthusiasm is
    accompanied by a powerful inner cohesion. War tests all the
    economic and organisational forces of a nation. In the final
    analysis, infinitely hard as the war has been for the workers and
    peasants, who are suffering famine and cold, it may be said on the
    basis of these two years’ experience that we are winning and
    will continue to win, because we have a hinterland, and a strong
    one, because, despite famine and cold, the peasants and workers
    stand together, have grown strong, and answer every heavy blow
    with a greater cohesion of their forces and increased economic
    might. And it is this alone that has made possible the victories
    over Kolchak, Yudenich and their allies, the strongest powers in
    the world. The past two years have shown, on the one hand, that a
    revolutionary war can be developed, and, on the other, that the
    Soviet system is growing stronger under the heavy blows of the
    foreign invasion, the aim of which is to destroy quickly the
    revolutionary centre, the republic of workers and peasants who
    have dared to declare war on international imperialism. But
    instead of destroying the workers and peasants of Russia, these
    heavy blows have served to harden them.
That is the chief lesson, the chief content of the present
    period. We are on the eve of decisive victories over Denikin, the
    last enemy left on our soil. We feel strong and may reiterate a
    thousand times over that we are not mistaken when we say that
    internally the Republic has become consolidated, and that we shall
    emerge from the war against Denikin very much stronger and better
    prepared for the task of erecting the socialist edifice-to which
    we have been able to devote all too little time and energy during
    the Civil War, but to which, now that we are setting foot on a
    free road, we shall undoubtedly be able to devote ourselves
    entirely.
In Western Europe we see the decay of imperialism. You know
    that a year ago it seemed even to the German socialists, and to
    the vast majority of socialists-who did not understand the state
    of affairs-that what was in progress was a struggle of two world
    imperialist groups, and they believed that this struggle
    constituted the whole of history, that there was no force capable
    of producing anything else. It seemed to them that even socialists
    had no alternative but to join sides with one of the groups of
    powerful world predators. That is how it seemed at the close of
    October 1918. But we find that in the year that has since elapsed
    world history has witnessed unparalleled events, profound and
    far-reaching events, and these have opened the eyes of many
    socialists who during the imperialist war were patriots and
    justified their conduct on the plea that they were faced with an
    enemy; they justified their alliance with the British and French
    imperialists on the grounds that these were supposedly bringing
    delivery from German imperialism. See how many illusions were
    shattered by that war! We are witnessing the decay of German
    imperialism, a decay which has led not only to a republican, but
    even to a socialist revolution. You know that in Germany today the
    class struggle has become still more acute and that civil war is
    drawing nearer and nearer-a war of the German proletariat against
    the German imperialists, who have adopted republican colours, but
    who remain imperialists.
 Everyone knows that the social revolution is maturing in
    Western Europe by leaps and bounds, and that the same thing is
    happening in America and in Britain, the countries ostensibly
    representing culture and civilisation, victors over the Huns, the
    German imperialists. Yet when it came to the Treaty of Versailles,
    everyone saw that it was a hundred times more rapacious than the
    Treaty of B rest which the German robbers forced upon us, and that
    it was the heaviest blow the capitalists and imperialists of those
    luckless victor countries could possibly have struck at
    themselves. The Treaty of Versailles opened the eyes of the people
    of the victor nations, and showed that in the case of Britain and
    France, even though they are democratic states, we have before us
    not representatives of culture and civilisation, but countries
    ruled by imperialist predators The internal struggle among these
    predators is developing so swiftly that we may rejoice in the
    knowledge that the Treaty of Versailles is only a seeming victory
    for the jubilant imperialists, and that in reality it signifies
    the bankruptcy of the entire imperialist world and the resolute
    abandonment by the working people of those socialists who during
    the war allied themselves with the representatives of decaying
    imperialism and defended one of the groups of belligerent
    predators. The eyes of the working people have been opened because
    the Treaty of Versailles was a rapacious peace and showed that
    France and Britain had actually fought Germany in order to
    strengthen their rule over the colonies and to enhance their
    imperialist might. That internal struggle grows broader as time
    goes on. Today I saw a wireless message from London dated November
    21, in which American journalists—men who cannot be
    suspected of sympathising with revolutionaries—say that in
    France an unprecedented outburst of hatred towards the Americans
    is to be observed, because the Americans refuse to ratify the
    Treaty of Versailles.
Britain and France are victors, but they are up to their ears
    in debt to America, who has decided that the French and the
    British may consider themselves victors as much as they like, but
    that she is going to skim the cream and exact usurious interest
    for her assistance during the war; and the guarantee of this is to
    be the American Navy which is now being built and is overtaking
    the British Navy in size. And the crudeness of the
    Americans’ rapacious imperialism may be seen from the fact
    that American agents are buying white slaves, women and girls, and
    shipping them to America for the development of prostitution. Just
    think, free, cultured America supplying white slaves for brothels!
    Conflicts with American agents are occurring in Poland and
    Belgium. That is a tiny illustration of what is taking place on a
    vast scale in every little country which received assistance from
    the Entente. Take Poland, for instance. You find American agents
    and profiteers going there and buying up all the wealth of Poland,
    who boasts that she is now an independent power. Poland is being
    bought up by American agents. There is not a factory or branch of
    industry which is not in the pockets of the Americans. The
    Americans have become so brazen that they are beginning to enslave
    that “great and free victor”, France, who was formerly
    a country of usurers, but is now deep in debt to America, because
    she has lost her economic strength, and has not enough grain or
    coal of her own and cannot develop her material resources on a
    large scale, while America insists that the tribute be paid
    unreservedly and in full. It is thus becoming increasingly
    apparent that France, Britain and other powerful countries are
    economically bankrupt. In the French elections the Clericats have
    gained the upper hand. The French people, who were deceived into
    devoting all their strength supposedly to the defence of freedom
    and democracy against Germany, have now been rewarded with an
    interminable debt, with the sneers of the rapacious American
    imperialists and, or, top of it, with a Clerical majority
    consisting of representatives of the most savage reaction.
The situation all over the world has become immeasurably more
    complicated. Our victory over Kolchak and Yudenich, those lackeys
    of international capital, is a big one; but far bigger, though not
    so evident, is the victory we are gaining on an international
    scale. That victory consists in the internal decay of imperialism,
    which is unable to send its troops against us. The Entente tried
    it, but to no purpose, because its troops become demoralised when
    they contact our troops and acquaint themselves with our Russian
    Soviet Constitution, translated into their languages. Despite the
    influence of the leaders of putrid socialism, our Constitution
    will always win the sympathy of the working people. The word
    “Soviet” is now understood by everybody, and the
    Soviet Constitution has been translated into all languages and is
    known to every worker. He knows that it is the constitution of
    working people, the political system of working people who are
    calling for victory over international capital, that it is a
    triumph we have achieved over the international imperialists. This
    victory of ours has had its repercussions in all imperialist
    countries, since we have deprived them of their own troops, won
    them over, deprived them of the possibility of using those troops
    against Soviet Russia.
They tried to wage war with the troops of other
    countries-Finland, Poland, and Latvia-but nothing came of
    it. British Minister Churchill, speaking in the House of Commons
    several weeks ago, boasted-and it was cabled all over the
    world-that a campaign of fourteen nations against Soviet Russia
    had been organised, and that this would result in victory over
    Russia by the New Year. And it is true that many nations
    participated in it-Finland, the Ukraine, Poland, Georgia, as well
    as the Czechoslovaks, the Japanese, the French, the British, and
    the Germans. But we know what came of it! We know that the
    Estonians left Yudenich’s forces in the lurch; and now a
    fierce controversy is going on in the press because the Estonians
    do not want to help him, while Finland, much as her bourgeoisie
    wanted it, has not assisted Yudenich either. Thus the second
    attempt to attack us has likewise failed. The first stage was the
    dispatch by the Entente of its own troops, equipped according to
    all the rules of military technique, so that it seemed they would
    defeat the Soviet Republic. They have already withdrawn from the
    Caucasus, Archangel and the Crimea; they still remain in Murmansk,
    as the Czechoslovaks do in Siberia, but only as isolated
    groups. The first attempt of the Entente to defeat us with its own
    forces ended in victory for us. The second attempt consisted in
    launching against us nations which re our neighbours, and which
    are entirely dependent financially on the Entente, and in trying
    to force them to crush us, as a nest of socialism. But that
    attempt, too, ended in failure: it turned out that not one of
    these little countries is capable of waging such a war. What is
    more, hatred of the Entente has taken firm root in every little
    country. If Finland did not set out to capture Petrograd when
    Yudenich had already captured Krasnoye Solo, it was because she
    hesitated, realising that she could live independently side by
    side with Soviet Russia, but could not live in peace with the
    Entente. All little nations have felt that. It is felt in Finland,
    Lithuania, Estonia, and Poland, where chauvinism is rampant, but
    where there is hatred of the Entente, which is expanding its
    exploitation in those countries. And now, accurately assessing the
    course of developments, we may say without exaggeration that not
    only the first, but also the second stage of the international war
    against the Soviet Republic has failed. All that remains for us to
    do now is to defeat Denikin’s forces, and they are already
    half-defeated,
Such is the present Russian and international situation, which
    I have summarised briefly in my address. Permit me, in conclusion,
    to say something about the situation that is developing in respect
    of the nationalities of the East. You are representatives of the
    communist organisations and Communist Parties of various Eastern
    peoples. I must say that the Russian Bolsheviks have succeeded in
    forcing a breach in the old imperialism, in undertaking the
    exceedingly difficult, but also exceedingly noble task of blazing
    new paths of revolution, whereas you, the representatives of the
    working people of the East, have before you a task that is still
    greater and newer. It is becoming quite clear that the socialist
    revolution which is impending for the whole world will not be
    merely the victory of the proletariat of each country over its own
    bourgeoisie. That would be possible if revolutions came easily and
    swiftly. We know that the imperialists will not allow this, that
    all countries are armed against their domestic Bolshevism and that
    their one thought is how to defeat Bolshevism at home. That is why
    in every country a civil war is brewing in which the old socialist
    compromisers are enlisted on the side of the bourgeoisie. Hence,
    the socialist revolution will not be solely, or chiefly, a
    struggle of the revolutionary proletarians in each country against
    their bourgeoisie-no, it will be a struggle of all the
    imperialist-oppressed colonies and countries, of all dependent
    countries, against international imperialism. Characterising the
    approach of the world social revolution in the Party Programme we
    adopted last March, we said that the civil war of the working
    people against the imperialists and exploiters in all the advanced
    countries is beginning to be combined with national wars against
    international imperialism. That is confirmed by the course of the
    revolution, and will be more and more confirmed as time goes
    on. It will be the same in the East.
We know that in the East the masses will rise as independent
    participants, as builders of a new life, because hundreds of
    millions of the people belong to dependent, underprivileged
    nations, which until now have been objects of international
    imperialist policy, and have only existed as material to fertilise
    capitalist culture and civilisation. And when they talk of handing
    out mandates for colonies, we know very well that it means handing
    out mandates for spoliation and plunder-handing out to an
    insignificant section of the world’s population the right to
    exploit the majority of the population of the globe. That
    majority, which up till then had been completely outside the orbit
    of historical progress, because it could not constitute an
    independent revolutionary force, ceased, as we know, to play such
    a passive role at the beginning of the twentieth century. We know
    that 1905 was followed by revolutions in Turkey, Persia and China,
    and that a revolutionary movement developed in India. The
    imperialist war likewise contributed to the growth of the
    revolutionary movement, because the European imperialists had to
    enlist whole colonial regiments in their struggle. The imperialist
    war aroused the East also and drew its peoples into international
    politics. Britain and France armed colonial peoples and helped
    them to familiarise themselves with military technique and
    up-todate machines. That knowledge they will use against the
    imperialist gentry. The period of the awakening of the East in the
    contemporary revolution is being succeeded by a period in which
    all the Eastern peoples will participate in deciding the destiny
    of the whole world, so as not to be simply objects of the
    enrichment of others. The peoples of the East are becoming alive
    to the need for practical action, the need for every nation to
    take part in shaping the destiny of all mankind.
That is why I think that in the history of the development of
    the world revolution-which, judging by its beginning, will
    continue for many years and will demand much effort-that in the
    revolutionary struggle, in the revolutionary movement you will be
    called upon to play a big part and to merge with our struggle
    against international imperialism. Your participation in the
    international revolution will confront you with a complicated and
    difficult task, the accomplishment of which will serve as the
    foundation for our common success, because here the majority of
    the people for the first time begin to act independently and will
    be an active factor in the fight to overthrow international
    imperialism.
Most of the Eastern peoples are in a worse position than the
    most backward country in Europe-Russia. But in our struggle
    against feudal survivals and capitalism, we succeeded in uniting
    the peasants and workers of Russia;

      and it was because the peasants and workers united against
      capitalism and feudalism that our victory was so easy. Here
      contact with the peoples of the East is particularly important,
      because the majority of the Eastern peoples are typical
      representatives of the working people-not workers who have
      passed through the school of capitalist factories, but typical
      representatives of the working and exploited peasant masses who
      are victims of medieval oppression. The Russian revolution
      showed how the proletarians, after defeating capitalism and
      uniting with the vast diffuse mass of working peasants, rose up
      victoriously against medieval oppression. Our Soviet Republic
      must now muster all the awakening peoples of the East and,
      together with them, wage a struggle against international
      imperialism.
In this respect you are confronted with a task which has not
    previously confronted the Communists of the world: relying upon
    the general theory and practice of communism, you must adapt
    yourselves to specific conditions such as do not exist in the
    European countries; you must be able to apply that theory and
    practice to conditions in which the bulk of the population are
    peasants, and in which the task is to wage a struggle against
    medieval survivals and not against capitalism. That is a difficult
    and specific task, but a very thankful one, because masses that
    have taken no part in the struggle up to now are being drawn into
    it, and also because the organisation of communist cells in the
    East gives you an opportunity to maintain the closest contact with
    the Third International. You must find specific forms for this
    alliance of the foremost proletarians of the world with the
    labouring and exploited masses of the East whose conditions are in
    many cases medieval. We have accomplished on a small scale in our
    country what you will do on a big scale and in big countries. And
    that latter task you will, I hope, perform with success. Thanks to
    the communist organisations in the East, of which you here are the
    represelitatives, you have contact with the advanced revolutionary
    proletariat. Your task is to continue to ensure that communist
    propaganda is carried on in every country in a language the people
    understand.
It is self-evident that final victory can be won only by the
    proletariat of all the advanced countries of the world, and we,
    the Russians, are beginning the work which the British, French or
    German proletariat will consolidate. But we see that they will not
    be victorious without the aid of the working people of all the
    oppressed colonial nations, first and foremost, of Eastern
    nations. We must realise that the transition to communism cannot
    be accomplished by the vanguard alone. The task is to arouse the
    working masses to revolutionary activity, to independent action
    and to organisation, regardless of the level they have reached; to
    translate the true communist doctrine, which was intended for the
    Communists of the more advanced countries, into the language of
    every people; to carry out those practical tasks which must be
    carried out immediately, and to join the proletarians of other
    countries in a common struggle.
Such are the problems whose solution you will not find in any
    communist book, but will find in the common struggle begun by
    Russia. You will have to tackle that problem and solve it through
    your own independent experience. In that you will be assisted, on
    the one hand, by close alliance with the vanguard of the working
    people of other countries, and, on the other, by ability to find
    the right approach to the peoples of the East whom you here
    represent. You will have to base yourselves on the bourgeois
    nationalism which is awakening, and must awaken, among those
    peoples, and which has its historical justification. At the same
    time, you must find your way to the working and exploited masses
    of every country and tell them in a language they understand that
    their only hope of emancipation lies in the victory of the
    international revolution, and that the international proletariat
    is the only ally of all the hundreds of millions of the working
    and exploited peoples of the East.
Such is the immense task which confronts you, and which, thanks
    to the era of revolution and the growth of the revolutionary
    movement-of that there can be no doubt-will, by the joint efforts
    of the communist organisations of the East, be successfully
    accomplished and crowned by complete victory over international
    imperialism.

Speech At The Opening Of The Conference
      December 2

      Comrades, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Russian
      Communist Party (Bolsheviks) I declare the All-Russia Party
      Conference open.
Comrades, according to Party Rules this type of conference
    should be convened every three months, but the difficult situation
    obtaining a few months ago in connection with the war forced us to
    bend our efforts and to reduce all bodies, both government and
    Party, to such an extent that we were unfortunately unable to
    carry out the Rules to the letter and the conference was
    postponed.
Comrades, we are calling this conference in connection with the
    Congress of Soviets[2] at a time when we have succeeded in
    achieving a tremendous improvement on the fronts, and when we are
    certain that we are on the eve of a gigantic change for the better
    in the international situation, in respect of the war and in
    respect of our internal development. The tasks that are unfolding
    before us have been frequently discussed at Party meetings and in
    the press, and we shall return to them when discussing definite
    individual items on the agenda. I shall, therefore, get right down
    to business and propose that you elect a presidium for the
    conference.
Let me have your proposals on that point, please.

Political Report Of The Central Committee
      December 2
(Applause.) Comrades, the present report of the Central
    Committee should, from the formal point of view, give you mainly a
    summary of experience acquired during the period under review. I
    must say that such an approach—confining oneself to history
    or, at any rate, making a report that turns mainly on
    history—is too far removed from the spirit of the times in
    which we live and from the tasks that confront us. In the present
    report, which I should also like to present to the Congress of
    Soviets, I intend to transfer the centre of gravity more to the
    lessons we are receiving, and which we must receive for our
    immediate practical activity, rather than to a description of what
    we have passed through.
Although we may say, without any exaggeration, that in the
    period under review we have achieved tremendous successes,
    although our main difficulty is now behind us, we still have ahead
    of us difficulties that are without doubt very, very great. The
    Party must naturally concentrate its attention wholly on the
    solution of those problems and may permit itself excursions into
    history only insofar as it is absolutely necessary for the
    solution of the problems facing us.
It stands to reason that in the past period of Soviet power the
    war question has persistently been the one on which we have mostly
    fixed our attention. The Civil War has involved everyone and
    everything, of course, and it goes without saying that in our
    struggle for existence we had to divert the Party’s best
    forces from other work and other activities and use them for war
    work. It was all we could do under war conditions. And no matter
    how much we have suffered from this withdrawal of creative forces
    from many spheres of government and Party activity, in the
    military sphere we have actually managed to effect a concentration
    of forces and achieve excellent results such as not only our
    enemies, not only the waverers, but probably even most of our own
    milieu would formerly have considered impossible. To hold out for
    two years against all our enemies who were supported directly and
    indirectly, first by German imperialism and then by the much more
    powerful Entente imperialism that has mastered the whole
    world—to hold out for two years in a country so badly ruined
    and so backward was such a problem that its solution was an
    undoubted “miracle”. It seems to me, therefore, that
    we must look closely to see how this “miracle” was
    effected and what practical deductions are to be made from it,
    deductions which will enable us to say conclusively—and I
    think we may say conclusively that great as the difficulties of
    internal organisation are we shall surmount them in the near
    future with a success equal to that with which we have solved the
    problems of military defence.
World imperialism, that in reality brought about the Civil War
    in our country and is responsible for protracting it, has suffered
    defeat in these two years, and we must first of all ask ourselves
    the question, how could it have happened that we were able to
    achieve such tremendous success in the struggle against world
    imperialism that even today is undoubtedly many times stronger
    than we are? To find an answer to this question we must make a
    general review of the history of the Civil War in Russia, the
    history of Entente intervention. In this war we must distinguish
    two periods that differ radically according to the methods of
    Entente activity employed, two periods or two basic methods of
    conducting military operations against Russia.
When the Entente had defeated Germany, at first it naturally
    relied on its own troops to crush the Soviet Republic in
    Russia. It stands to reason that if the Entente had used but a
    fraction of the gigantic armies that were released after the
    defeat of Germany, if it had been able to use even one-tenth of
    those armies in a proper manner against the Russian Soviet
    Republic we should not, of course, have been able to hold out. It
    is typical of the first period of the Civil War in Russia that the
    attempt of the Entente to smash the Soviet Republic using its own
    troops was a failure. The Entente had to withdraw the British
    troops operating on the Archangel Front. The landing of French
    forces in the South of Russia ended in a number of mutinies on the
    part of French sailors, and today, no matter how frantically the
    wartime censor may operate—there is no war but the former
    wartime censor, now the non-war-time censor, continues to function
    in the supposedly free countries, Britain and France—and
    although copies of newspapers reach us on rare occasions we have
    very precise documentary evidence from Britain and France to the
    effect that information concerning, for instance, the mutiny of
    the sailors on French warships in the Black Sea has got into the
    French press, that the sentencing of several French sailors to
    penal servitude has become known in France, that the entire
    communist, the entire revolutionary working-class press in France
    and Britain refers to the facts; the name of Comrade Jeanne
    Labourbe, whom the French shot in Odessa for Bolshevik propaganda,
    has become a slogan for the French working-class socialist press,
    not only for the Communist wing, but even for a newspaper like l’Humanité
    that in its basic principles is actually closer to the point of
    view of our Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, even for
    that newspaper the name of Labourbe has become a slogan of
    struggle against French imperialism, for non-intervention in
    Russian affairs. In the same way letters from British soldiers on
    the Archangel Front have been discussed in the British
    working-class press. We have very exact documentary evidence of
    this. It is quite obvious to us, therefore, that the tremendous
    change that formerly we always spoke of and which we so deeply
    hoped for has taken place; it has undoubtedly become a fact even
    though the process is an unusually slow one.
This change had to be evoked by the very course of events. It
    is specifically those countries that always have been and still
    are regarded as the most democratic, civilised and cultured that
    conducted a war against Russia by the most brutal means, without
    even a shade of legality. The Bolsheviks are accused of violating
    democracy—this is the most popular argument against us among
    the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries and in the entire
    European bourgeois press. But not one of those democratic states
    has taken or would dare to take the risk under the laws of its own
    country of declaring war on Soviet Russia. Parallel to this there
    is a protest, outwardly unnoticeable but nevertheless a profound
    protest on the part of the working-class press which asks where,
    in their constitution, in the constitution of France, Britain or
    America, are to be found laws permitting the conduct of war
    without having declared war and without having consulted
    parliament? The press of Britain, France and America has proposed
    to arraign their heads of state for a crime against the state, for
    declaring war without the permission of parliament. Such proposals
    have been made, although it is true that it was in papers that
    come out not more than once a week and are probably confiscated
    not less than once a month and have a circulation of a few hundred
    or a few thousand copies. The leaders of the responsible
    government parties could afford to ignore such papers. But here we
    have to consider two different tendencies; the ruling classes
    throughout the world publish well-known capitalist dailies in
    millions of copies and these are packed with unprecedented lies
    and slander against the Bolsheviks. But down below, the
    working-class masses learn about the falsity of that whole
    campaign from the soldiers who have returned from Russia. That is
    why it became necessary for the Entente to withdraw its forces
    from Russia.
When we said at the very outset that we place our stakes on the
    world revolution we were laughed at, and hundreds of times it was
    said and is still being said that it cannot be realised. During
    the past two years we have obtained precise material with which to
    verify it. If we speak of that stake as meaning hopes for a rapid,
    immediate insurrection in Europe, then we know there has not been
    one. That stake, however, proved to be fundamentally a true one
    and from the very outset it removed all possibility of an armed
    intervention on the part of the Entente; after two years and
    especially since the defeat of Kolchak and since the withdrawal of
    British forces from Archangel and from the entire Northern Front
    this has become an undoubted historical fact. A very small part of
    the armies at the disposal of the Entente would have been enough
    to crush us. But we were able to defeat the enemy because the
    sympathy of the workers of the whole world made itself felt at the
    most difficult moment. And thus we succeeded in emerging
    honourably from this first period of the Entente invasion. I
    remember some article, Radek’s I think, said that the
    Entente troops’ contact with the hot soil of Russia, the
    country that had started the fire of the socialist revolution,
    would also set those troops on fire. Events showed that this
    really did happen. It goes without saying, furthermore, that the
    processes that are taking place among the British and French
    soldiers and sailors who know the names of those who have been
    shot for Bolshevik agitation, no matter how weak these processes
    are, no matter how weak the communist organisations are over
    there, are doing a gigantic job. The results are visible they have
    compelled the Entente countries to withdraw their forces. This
    alone gave us our first major victory.
The second method or second system employed by the Entente in
    its struggle was to use small states against us. It was reported
    in a Swedish newspaper[3] at the end of last August that the
    British Secretary for War, Churchill, had said that fourteen
    states would attack Russia so that the fall of Petrograd and
    Moscow was certain in the near future, at any rate by the end of
    the year. I believe Churchill later denied having made this
    statement and said that the Bolsheviks had invented it. We have,
    however, exact information as to which Swedish newspaper published
    it. We therefore insist that the report came from European
    sources. Furthermore it is supported by facts. We know from the
    example of Finland and Estonia that the Entente has bent all its
    efforts to force them to attack Soviet Russia. I personally read
    one leading article in the British newspaper The Times on
    the question of Finland[4] at the time when Yudenich’s
    troops were a few versts from Petrograd and the city was in
    tremendous danger. The article was seething with wrath and
    indignation, and was written in an unprecedentedly impassioned
    style, unusual for that newspaper (such newspapers usually write
    in diplomatic language similar to that used in Milyukov’s Rech
    in Russia). It was the wildest proclamation addressed to Finland
    and presenting the question bluntly—the fate of the world
    depended on Finland and the eyes of all civilised capitalist
    countries were fixed on her. We know that that was the decisive
    moment when Yudenich’s troops were a few versts from
    Petrograd. It makes no difference whether Churchill made the
    statement quoted or not, he certainly pursued that policy. It is
    well known what pressure the Entente brought to bear on those
    small countries that had been hastily formed, were weak and wholly
    dependent on the Entente even in such basic questions as that of
    food and in all other respects. They cannot break away from that
    dependence. All kinds of pressure—financial, food,
    military—have been applied to force Estonia, Finland, and no
    doubt Latvia, Lithuania and Poland as well, to force that whole
    group of states to make war on us. The history of Yudenich’s
    last campaign against Petrograd has shown to the full that the
    Entente’s second method of conducting war has failed. There
    can be no doubt that the least bit of aid from Finland or—a
    little more aid—from Estonia would have been enough to
    decide the fate of Petrograd. Nor is there any doubt that the
    Entente, realising the gravity of the situation, did everything it
    could to obtain that aid but nevertheless suffered defeat.
This was the second major international victory that we
    achieved and it was a more complicated victory than the first. The
    first was achieved because it turned out that British and French
    troops could not be retained on the territory of Russia; they did
    not fight but provided Britain and France with rebels who raised
    the British and French workers against their own governments. And
    so it has happened that although Russia has been deliberately
    encircled by a ring of small states obviously created and
    maintained for the struggle against Bolshevism, this weapon, too,
    has turned against the Entente. There are bourgeois governments in
    all these states and almost everywhere there are bourgeois
    collaborators in those governments, people who, because of their
    class position, go against the Bolsheviks. Every one of these
    nations, of course, is definitely hostile to the Bolsheviks, but
    we, nevertheless, have managed to turn those bourgeois and
    collaborators to our side. This seems improbable, but it is true,
    because each of those states, after what it has experienced in the
    imperialist war, is bound to hesitate on the question of whether
    it is now worth its while to fight against the Bolsheviks when the
    only other claimant to power in Russia—a claimant that they
    have reason to consider serious—is either Kolchak or
    Denikin, that is, representatives of old imperialist Russia; and
    there is no doubt that Kolchak and Denikin represent old
    Russia. We have, therefore, been given an opportunity to rely on
    another crack in the imperialist camp. During the first months
    following our revolution we were able to hold out because the
    German and British imperialists were at each other’s
    throats, but after those six months we were able to hold out for
    more than another six months because the troops of the Entente
    were in no condition to fight against us; the following year,
    however, the year that we now have mainly to render account for,
    we held out successfully because the attempt of the Great Powers
    under whose influence the small countries undoubtedly are, the
    attempt of those Great Powers to mobilise the small countries
    against us has been a failure because of the contradiction between
    the interests of world imperialism and the interests of those
    countries. The Entente has already had its paws on each of the
    small countries. They know that when the French, American or
    British capitalists say, “We guarantee you
    independence”, that means in practice, “We shall buy
    from you all the sources of your wealth and shall hold you in
    bondage. Furthermore, we shall treat you with the insolence of an
    officer who has come to a foreign country to administer it and to
    speculate in it and who will not consider anybody’s
    opinion”. They know that the British Ambassador in almost
    all such countries is of greater significance than a local king or
    parliament. And if petty-bourgeois democrats have so far been
    unable to comprehend this verity, reality has now compelled them
    to understand it. It has turned out that as far as concerns the
    bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements of the small countries the
    imperialists are plundering, we are, maybe, not allies, but at any
    rate more reliable and more valuable neighbours than the
    imperialists.
That is the second victory over world imperialism that we have
    won.
That is why we now have every right to say that the main
    difficulties are behind us. There is no doubt that the Entente
    will make many more attempts at armed intervention in our
    affairs. Although the latest victories over Kolchak and Yudenich
    have now given spokesmen of all those powers cause to say that a
    campaign against Russia is hopeless and to offer us peace, we must
    realise clearly the meaning of such statements. What I am now
    going to say is not for the record ....
Since we have managed to extract admissions of this kind from
    bourgeois intellectuals, from our merciless enemies, we have every
    right to say that the sympathies, not only of the working class,
    but also of extensive circles of bourgeois intellectuals are on
    the side of Soviet power. The philistines, the petty bourgeoisie,
    those who wavered in the savage fight between labour and capital,
    have now come over definitely to our side, and we may to some
    extent anticipate their support.
We must take this victory into consideration and if we link it
    up with the way we, in the long run, achieved the victory over
    Kolchak, the conclusion becomes more convincing ... now you may
    begin writing again, the diplomacy is finished.
If we ask the question as to what forces made our victory over
    Kolchak possible, we have to admit that the victory over Kolchak,
    despite his having operated on territory where the proletariat was
    in a minority and we were unable to give the peasantry direct,
    real help to overthrow the power of the landowners as we did in
    Russia, despite Kolchak’s having begun on a front supported
    by Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who established the
    front of the Constituent Assembly, despite there having been the
    most favourable conditions for the formation of a government that
    could rely on the aid of world imperialism—despite all this
    the experiment ended in the complete defeat of Kolehak. We have
    the right to draw the following conclusion from this, a conclusion
    that is very significant to us and should guide us in all our
    activities—the class that can lead the mass of the
    population must triumph historically. The Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries are still talking about the Constituent
    Assembly, about the will of the nation, and so on, but during this
    period experience has convinced us that in revolutionary times the
    class struggle is carried on in the most terrible forms but can
    lead to victory only when the class conducting the struggle is
    capable of giving leadership to the majority of the people. In
    this respect, the comparison that was made, not by voting with
    tickets, but by more than a year’s experience of the most
    arduous, most bloody struggle that demanded a hundred times more
    sacrifices than any political struggle—this experience in
    respect of Kolchak has shown that more than any other party we are
    putting into effect the rule of that class the majority of which
    we have proved capable of leading and that we are adding the
    peasantry to our ranks as friends and allies.The example of
    Kolchak demonstrated this. In the social sphere this exam ple has
    been the latest lesson for us; it shows on whom we can depend and
    who will go against us.
No matter how greatly the working class may have been weakened
    by the imperialist war and the economic ruin it is nevertheless
    effecting political leadership, but it would not be able to if it
    had not gained the majority of the working population, under
    Russian conditions the peasantry, as friends and allies. This has
    taken place in the Red Army where we have been able to employ
    specialists, the majority of whom were against us, and create the
    army which, according to the admission of our enemies, the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, as evidenced by a resolution of the
    last Council of their party, is a people’s and not a
    mercenary army.[5] The working class was able to build up
    an army the majority of which does not belong to that class and
    was able to employ specialists hostile to it only because it led
    and made friends and allies of that mass of working people
    connected with petty proprietorship, who have property connections
    and who, therefore, have a profound interest in free trading,
    i. e., in capitalism, in the return to the power of money. This is
    at the bottom of everything we have achieved in the past two
    years. In all our further work, in all our further activities, in
    those activities that must be begun in the Ukraine now being
    liberated, in all the organisational work that will he developing
    in all its difficulty and importance after the victory over
    Denikin, we must keep this basic lesson always before our eyes, we
    must remember it more than anything else. This, in my opinion,
    sums up the political results of all our work.
Comrades, it has been said that war is a continuation of
    politics. We have experienced that in our own war. The imperialist
    war that was a continuation of the politics of the imperialists,
    of the ruling classes, of landowners and capitalists, brought
    forth the hostility of the masses of the people and was the best
    means of revolutionising them. Here in Russia the war helped
    overthrow the monarchy, helped abolish landed proprietorship and
    overthrow the bourgeoisie, all of which was done with unparalleled
    ease only because the imperialist war was a continuation and an
    aggravation of imperialist politics that had become more
    insolent. And our war was a continuation of our communist
    politics, the politics of the proletariat. We still read in the
    Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary papers and we hear from
    non-party and from wavering people, “You promised peace and
    have given us war, you have deceived the working people.”And
    we say that the masses of the working people who have not studied
    Marxism have nevertheless learned full well the difference between
    imperialist and civil war, learned it through their class
    instinct, the instinct of oppressed people who have themselves for
    decades experienced what the landowner and capitalist are. Those
    who have experienced oppression for decades all realise that there
    is a difference between wars. The imperialist war was a
    continuation of imperialist politics; it aroused the masses
    against their masters. The Civil War is a war against the
    landowners and capitalists and is a continuation of the policy of
    overthrowing the power of those landowners and capitalists, and
    each month the development of the war has strengthened the bonds
    between the mass of working people and the proletariat that has
    assumed the leadership in the war. No matter how great the trials
    may have been, no matter how frequent the big defeats, no matter
    how serious those defeats have been, no matter how many times the
    enemy has achieved tremendous victories and the existence of
    Soviet power has hung by a thread—there have been such
    moments, and there is no doubt the Entente will again try to fight
    against us—it must be said that the experience we have
    gained is a very sound one. That experience has shown that war
    strengthens the political consciousness of the working people and
    shows them the advantages of Soviet power. NaÂve people or
    those who are wholly wrapped up in the prejudices of the old petty
    bourgeoisie or of the old bourgeois-democratic parliamentarisrn
    expect the peasant to decide through an election slip whether he
    will follow the Bolshevik Communists or the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries; they do not want to recognise any other
    decision because they are in favour of rights for the people,
    freedom, the Constituent Assembly, etc. Events made it necessary
    for the peasant to verify the issue in practice. After having
    given the Socialist-Revolutionaries the majority in the
    Constituent Assembly, after the policy of the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries had failed and the peasants had to deal
    with the Bolsheviks in practice, they realised that our government
    is a sound one, it is a government that demands rather a lot, it
    is a government that is able to ensure the fulfilment of those
    demands at all costs, it is a government that regards the loan of
    bread to the hungry to be the absolute duty of the peasants even
    if they receive no equivalent in return, they realised that ours
    is a government that will ensure the supply of bread to the hungry
    no matter at what cost. The peasant saw this and compared our
    government with that of Kolchak and Denikin, and he made his
    choice, not through the ballot-box but by deciding the issue in
    practice when he ..ad had the experience of both kinds of
    government. The peasant is deciding and will continue to decide
    the question in our favour.
That is what the history of Kolchak’s defeat has taught
    us and that is what our victories in the South have proved. That
    is why we say that literally masses, millions of people living in
    the villages, millions of peasants are coming over completely to
    our side. I think this is the chief political lesson that we have
    learned in this period and which we must apply to the problems of
    internal organisation that will, with the victory over Denikin
    near, be placed on the order of the day now that it has become
    possible for us to concentrate on internal development.
The chief accusation made against us by the European petty
    bourgeoisie concerns our terrorism, our crude suppression of the
    intelligentsia and the petty bourgeoisie. “You and your
    governments have forced all that upon us,” we say in
    reply. When people shout about terror we answer, “When
    countries who have the world’s fleets at their disposal and
    have armed forces that are a hundred times greater than ours
    pounced upon us and compelled small states to make war on
    us—was that not terrorism?”
That was real terrorism when all the powers united against a
    country that was one of the most backward and most weakened by
    war. Even Germany kept helping the Entente from the time before
    her defeat when she was supplying Krasnov and up to the present
    day, when that same Germany is blockading us and giving direct
    help to our enemies. This attack by world imperialism, this
    campaign against us, this bribery of conspirators inside the
    country—was this not terrorism? The reason for our terrorism
    was that we were attacked by armed forces against which we had to
    bend all our efforts. Inside the country we had to act with all
    persistence, we had to muster all our forces. In this case we did
    not want to be—and we decided that we would not be—in
    the position in which those who collaborated with Kolchak in
    Siberia found themselves, the position in which the German
    collaborationists will find themselves tomorrow, those who imagine
    they represent a government and are relying on the Constituent
    Assembly although at any moment a hundred or a thousand officers
    can push that government out of office. This can be understood
    because those officers constitute a trained, organised mass with
    an excellent knowledge of the art of war, that holds all the
    strings in its hands, that is well informed about the bourgeoisie
    and the landowners and enjoys their sympathies.
This has been demonstrated by the history of all countries
    since the imperialist war, and today, when faced with such
    terrorism on the part of the Entente, we have the right to resort
    to terror ourselves.
It follows from this that the accusation of terror, insofar as
    it is justified, should be against the bourgeoisie and not against
    us. They forced terror upon us. And we shall be the first to take
    steps to confine it to the lowest possible minimum as soon as we
    put an end to the chief source of terrorism—the invasion of
    world imperialism, the war plots and the military pressure of
    world imperialism on our country.
While speaking of terrorism we must say something about our
    attitude to that middle stratum, the intelligentsia, that mostly
    complain about the brutality of Soviet power and that Soviet power
    puts them in a worse position than before.
Whatever we, with the meagre means at our disposal, can do for
    the intelligentsia we are doing. We know, of course, the little
    significance of the paper ruble, but we also know the significance
    of the black market as an aid to those who cannot get enough food
    through our food organisations. In this respect we give the
    bourgeois intelligentsia an advantage. We know that at the moment
    when world imperialism pounced on us we had to introduce strict
    military discipline and defend ourselves with all the forces we
    could muster. When we are pursuing a revolutionary war we cannot,
    of course, do what all bourgeois states do—leave the working
    people to bear the brunt of the war. The burden of the Civil War
    must be and will be shared by the entire intelligentsia, all the
    petty bourgeoisie, and all middle-class elements—all of them
    will bear the burden. It will naturally be more difficult for them
    to bear that burden because they have been privileged for decades,
    but in the interests of the social revolution we must place that
    burden on their shoulders, too. This is the way we reason and the
    way we act, and we cannot do otherwise.
The end of the Civil War will be a step towards improving the
    conditions of those groups. We have already shown by our tariff
    policy and by the declaration in our programme that we recognise
    the need to give these groups better conditions because the
    transition from capitalism to communism is impossible unless the
    bourgeois specialists are used; and all our victories—all
    the victories of the Red Army led by the proletariat that has
    drawn over to its side the peasantry who are half labourers and
    half property-owners—were achieved partly because of our
    ability to use bourgeois specialists. This policy of ours as
    expressed in matters military must become the policy of our
    internal development.
The experience gained in this period tells us that while laying
    the foundations of the building we have often undertaken work on
    the dome, on all sorts of ornament, etc. Perhaps this was, to a
    certain extent, necessary for a socialist republic. Perhaps we had
    to build up in all spheres of national life. The craving to build
    up in all spheres is perfectly natural. If we were to look at what
    has been done in the sphere of state organisation we would see
    almost everywhere many things begun and abandoned; these are the
    sort that make one want to say when looking at them that they
    could have waited and we should have begun with the main thing. It
    is quite natural that all our leading people should be interested
    in the tasks that can be carried out only after the foundations
    have been laid. But on the basis of this experience we can now say
    that in future we shall concentrate our efforts more on the main
    job, on the foundation, on those simple problems that are the most
    difficult to solve but which we shall nevertheless solve. These
    are the problem of bread, the problem of fuel and the problem of
    fighting the lice. These are three simple problems that will make
    possible the building of a socialist republic and then our victory
    throughout the world will be a hundred times more certain and more
    triumphant than that with which we repulsed the attack of the
    Entente.
The bread problem. We have achieved much with our
    requisitioning system. Our food policy has made it possible in the
    second year to acquire three times as much grain as in the
    first. During three months of the last campaign more grain was
    procured than during three months of last year, although, as you
    will hear in the report by the People’s Commissar for Food,
    it was accompanied by what were, without doubt, great
    difficulties. One raid by Mamontov that took in the whole southern
    part of the central agricultural zone cost us very dear. But we
    have learned to carry out the requisitioning system, i.e., we have
    learned to make the peasants sell their grain to the state at
    fixed prices, without an equivalent in exchange. We know full
    well, of course, that paper money is not the equivalent of
    grain. We know that the peasant is loaning us his grain, and we
    ask him, “Should you hold back your grain waiting for an
    equivalent so that the workers can die of starvation? Do you want
    to trade on a free market and take us thereby back to
    capitalism?” Many intellectuals who have read Marx do not
    understand that freedom to trade is a return to capitalism; the
    peasant, however, understands it more easily. He knows that to
    sell bread at free prices, when the starving are prepared to pay
    anything for it, are prepared to give up all they have to escape
    death from starvation—he knows that this is a return to
    exploitation, that it is freedom for the rich to make a profit and
    ruination for the poor. We say that this is a crime against the
    state and we shall not yield an inch in this struggle.
In this struggle to requisition grain the peasant will have to
    loan his grain to the hungry worker—that is the only way to
    begin proper organisation, to restore industry, etc. If the
    peasant does not do this, there will be a return to capitalism. If
    the peasant feels that he has ties with the workers he will be
    prepared to surrender his grain surpluses at fixed prices, i. e.,
    for a simple piece of coloured paper—this is something
    essential without which the starving worker cannot be saved from
    death, without which industry cannot be rehabilitated. It is an
    extremely difficult problem and it cannot be solved by force
    alone. NO matter bow much shouting there may be about the
    Bolsheviks being a party that coerces the peasantry, we still say,
    “Gentlemen, it is a lie!” If we were a party that
    coerces the peasantry, how could we have held out against Kolchak,
    how could we have formed a conscript army in which four-fifths of
    the, soldiers are peasants, all of whom are armed and who have the
    example of the imperialist war to show them that a rifle can
    easily be turned in any direction? How can we be a party that
    coerces the peasants—we, a party that is putting into effect
    the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, a party
    that tells the peasantry that the transition to free trading is a
    return to capitalism and that our requisitioning of surpluses by
    force is directed against the profiteer and not against the
    working people?
The requisitioning of grain must be the basis of all our
    activity. The food problem is at the basis of all problems. We
    have to devote a great deal of effort to defeat Denikin. There
    must not be the slightest hesitation or carelessness until the
    victory is complete, for all sorts of turns are possible. Whenever
    there is the slightest improvement in the war situation, however,
    we must devote ’greater effort to the work of food supplies
    because that is the basis of everything. The requisitioning must
    be carried out in full. Only when we have solved that problem
    shall. we have a socialist foundation, and on that socialist
    foundation we shall be able to erect the splendid edifice of
    socialism that we have so often begun to build from the top and
    which has so often collapsed.
Another basic problem is tha’t of fuel, the main
    foundation for our development. This is the problem we have come
    up against now, since we cannot take advantage of our successes in
    food supplies, since we cannot transport the grain, cannot make
    full use of our victories because there is no fuel. We still do
    not have a proper apparatus to settle the fuel problem, but it is
    possible to settle it.
There is a shortage of coal throughout Europe today. If the
    fuel problem is so acute in the richest of the victor countries,
    even those like America that has never been attacked or invaded,
    it naturally affects us too. It will take us several years to
    rehabilitate the coal industry, even under the best
    conditions.
We have to save ourselves with firewood. We are devoting more
    and more Party forces to this work. During the last week the
    greatest attention has been paid to this problem in the Council of
    People’s Commissars and the Council of Defence and a number
    of measures have been adopted that should effect a turningpoint in
    this sphere similar to that effected by our armies on the Southern
    Front. Our activities in this field must not slacken and every
    step must bring us closer to victory in the battle against the
    fuel hunger. The material supplies are available. Until we have
    restored the coal industry we can manage with firewood and keep
    industry supplied with fuel. We must devote all Party forces,
    comrades, to that basic problem.
Our third problem is that of the fight against lice, against
    the lice that carry typhus. Typhus among a population that is
    exhausted by hunger, is ill, has no bread, soap or fuel, may prove
    a calamity that will prevent our tackling any sort of socialist
    development.
This is the first step in our struggle for culture and this,
    too, is a struggle for existence.
These are the main problems. To these I should like to draw the
    attention, more than to anything else, of comrades who are members
    of the Party. So far the attention we have been paying to these
    problems is so little as to be out of all proportion. Nine-tenths
    of the forces that are not engaged in war activities—which
    must not be lessened for a single minute—must be directed to
    these priority tasks. We now have a clear picture of the issues at
    stake. Everyone must make the best possible effort; all our forces
    must be devoted to these tasks.
With this I shall end the political section of the report. As
    far as the international, part is concerned, Comrade Chicherin
    will report on that in detail and will read you the proposal we
    should like to make to the belligerent countries in the name of
    the Congress of Soviets.
I shall deal very briefly with Party tasks. In the course of
    the revolution our Party has been confronted with a most important
    task. It is natural, on the one band, that all the worst elements
    should cling to the ruling party merely because it is the ruling
    party. On the other hand, the working class is exhausted and is
    naturally weak in a country that is in ruins. Nevertheless it is
    only the advanced section of the working class, its vanguard, that
    is capable of leading the country. To accomplish this task in the
    sphere of state organisation we have employed subbotniks as one of
    the means. The slogan we have put forward is this—the first
    who can join our Party are those who have volunteered for the
    front; those who cannot fight must show in their own places that
    they understand what the workers’ party is, they must show
    it by applying the principles of communism in practice. And
    communism, if you take that word in its strict meaning, is
    voluntary unpaid work for the common good that does not depend on
    individual differences, that wipes out all memories of everyday
    prejudices, wipes out stagnation, tradition, differences between
    branches of work, differences in the rate of pay for labour,
    etc. This is one of the greatest guarantees that we are drawing
    the working class and all working people into the work of
    peace-time organisation as well as into war-time activities. The
    further development of communist subbotniks must be a
    school.. Every step must be accompanied by the attraction into the
    Party of working-class elements and the most reliable people from
    other classes. We achieve this by means of re-registration. We are
    not afraid to remove those who are not fully reliable. We also
    achieve this by trusting a Party member who comes to us in a
    difficult time. Those Party members, as today’s Central
    Committee report shows, who came to us in hundreds and thousands
    when Yudenich was a few versts from Petrograd and Denikin was
    north of Orel, when the bourgeoisie were already
    jubilant—those Party members are worthy of our trust. We
    value the extension of the Party on these lines.
After we have carried out the expansion of the Party on these
    lines we must shut the gates, we must be particularly cautious. We
    must say that now the Party is victorious we do not need new Party
    members. We know ’full well that in a disintegrating
    capitalist society a mass of harmful people will try to worm their
    way into the Party. We must create a party that will be a party of
    workers in which there is no place for alien elements, but we must
    also draw the masses into the work, those who are outside the
    Party. How is this to be done? The means to this
    end—workers’ and peasants’ non-party
    conferences. An article on non-party conferences[6] was
    recently published in Pravda. This article, written by Comrade
    Rostopehin, deserves special attention. I do not know any other
    way of solving this problem of profound historical importance. The
    Party cannot throw its doors wide open, because it is absolutely
    inevitable that in the epoch of disintegrating capitalism it will
    gather to itself the worst elements. The Party must be so narrow
    that it draws into its ranks only those elements from other
    classes that it has an opportunity to test with great caution.
But we have several hundred thousand.Party members in a country
    with a population of more than a hundred million. How can such a
    party govern? In the first place there are, and must be, the trade
    unions to assist it, and these have millions of members; the
    second assistant is non-party conferences. At these non-party
    conferences we must be able to approach the non-proletarian
    section, we must overcome prejudice and petty-bourgeois
    vacillation—that is one of our most important, fundamental
    tasks.
We must assess the success of our Party organisations, not only
    by the number of Party members engaged in some kind of work, not
    only by the degree of success in carrying out the re-registration,
    but by non-party workers’ and peasants’ conferences,
    whether they are arranged correctly and often enough, that is, by
    the ability of the organisation to approach those masses that
    cannot at the moment join the Party but which we must draw into
    the work.
If we have beaten the Entente it is probably because we have
    earned the sympathy of the working class, and of the non-party
    masses. If we have succeeded in defeating Kolchak it is probably
    because he was no longer able to draw more forces from the
    reservoir of the working people. We have a reservoir that no other
    government in the world has and which no government in the world
    except the government of the working class can have, because only
    the government of the working class can draw with absolute
    confidence on the most downtrodden and most backward working
    people. We can and must draw our forces from among the non-party
    workers and peasants because they are our true friends. For the
    solution of the bread and fuel problems and for the fight against
    typhus we can draw forces from these masses that were the most
    oppressed, by the capitalists and landowners. And we are assured
    of the support of those masses. We shall continue to draw more and
    more forces from these masses and we may say that in the end we
    shall defeat all our enemies. And we shall work miracles in the
    sphere of peaceful construction (to be developed in proper style
    after Denikin has been defeated) that will be greater than those
    we have worked in the military sphere in the past two years.

Concluding Speech On The Political 
      Report Of The Central Committee
      December 2

      I should have declined to reply to the discussion if Comrade
      Sapronov had not egged me on; I want to polemise a little with
      him. There is no doubt that we should listen to what experienced
      local functionaries have to say. All their advice is valuable to
      us. But I ask you, what is there bad in what is written here? I
      was not acquainted with that point. Sapronov gave it to me. It
      says here, “Draft Instructions to Gubernia, Uyezd and
      Volost Committees on Work in the Countryside.”[7] So the
      instructions are addressed to those local functionaries through
      whom the work in the localities is carried on. When agitators,
      commissars, agents or representatives of the Central Committee
      are sent they are undoubtedly always given instructions. Clause
      9 here says: “Obtain from state farms and from communes
      help for the neighbouring peasants, immediate and real
      help.” I assumed that even an agent of the Central
      Committee would have a head on his shoulders. If regulations
      have been approved, how can he demand that they give up a cart,
      a horse or something? On this score we have instructions
      enough—some people say there are too many of them. And an
      agent of the C.C. can make demands only insofar as the
      instructions allow it, and no commune manager would allow a
      cart, a horse or a cow to be given away. But this is a serious
      question, because it often spoils our relations with the
      peasants, and in the Ukraine they may be spoiled a second time,
      if we are unable to put our political line into effect. It is
      not difficult to carry it out, and the peasant will he glad of
      even a little help. It is not enough to adopt an instruction,
      you must be able to carry it out. If Comrade Sapronov is afraid
      that a state farm will be robbed of a cow, a horse or a cart,
      let him share his tremendous experience in this field with us
      and say “Let us give the peasants implements free of
      charge or at low cost”. That I can understand. And in any
      case Clause 9 will not be abolished by that, it will, on the
      contrary, receive confirmation. The relations between the
      communes and state farms and the neighbouring peasants is one of
      the most painful aspects of our entire policy. It will be still
      more serious in the Ukraine and tomorrow it will be the same in
      Siberia. Today we have won over the Siberian peasant
      ideologically by liberating him from Kolchak. But it will not be
      of any duration unless we can so arrange matters that the
      peasant gets real assistance, and it stands to reason that every
      agent working in the countryside must be given the relevant
      instructions. And when an agent makes his report he must be
      asked: “Where and in what way did the state farms help
      time peasant?” Comrade Sapronov’s directives on this
      point were incorrect. It is our basic, unconditional duty to
      make use of the experience of local Party
      functionaries. (Applause.)

Draft Resolution On Foreign Policy[8]
The Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic wishes to live
    in peace with all peoples and devote all its efforts to internal
    development so as to put production, transport and government
    affairs in order on the basis of the Soviet system; this has so
    far been prevented by the intervention of the Entente and the
    starvation blockade.
The workers’ and peasants’ government has made
    repeated peace proposals to the Entente powers—the message
    from the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs to the
    American representative, Mr. Poole, on August 5, 1918; to
    President Wilson on October 24, 1918; to all Entente governments
    through representatives of neutral countries on November 3, 1918;
    a message from the Sixth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on
    November 7, 1918; Litvinov’s Note in Stockholm to all
    Entente representatives on December 23, 1918; then there were the
    messages of January 12, January 17 and February 4, 1919, and the
    draft treaty drawn up jointly with Bullitt on March 12, 1919; and
    a message through Nansen on May 7, 1919.
The Seventh Congress of Soviets fully approves these many steps
    taken by the Council of People’s Commissars and the
    People’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, once more confirms
    its lasting desire for peace and again proposes to the Entente
    powers, Britain, France, the United States of America, Italy and
    Japan, individually and collectively, to begin immediately
    negotiations on peace; the Congress instructs the All-Russia
    Central Executive Committee, the Council of People’s
    Commissars and the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs
    to continue this peace policy systematically (or: to continue this
    peace policy systematically, taking all appropriate measures to
    ensure its success).

Speech Summing Up The Debate On Soviet Power In The Ukraine
      December 3

      Comrades, there is little for me to say, although unfortunately
      I shall have to raise objections, not so much to Comrade
      Yakovlev who spoke before me, as to Comrades Bubnov and Drobnis
      who spoke after me. Nevertheless I shall have to make only a
      partial comment.
Insofar as Comrade Rakovsky’s speech is concerned, I must
    say that when he said that state farms must be the basis of our
    communist construction he was wrong. Under no circumstances can we
    organise our affairs in that way. We must accept the fact that we
    should convert only a very small part of the progressive farms
    into state farms, otherwise we shall not effect a bloc with the
    petty peasants—and we need that bloc. When some of the
    comrades said that I recommend a bloc, with the Borotba Party64
    they mistook my meaning. Here I compared the policy that must be
    pursued in respect of the Borotba Party with the policy we had
    pursued in respect of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. We were
    then accused, in the first week after October—at peasant
    congresses, incidentally—of not wanting to use the forces of
    the peasantry once we had seized power. In reply I said that we
    had taken over their programme in its entirety so as to use the
    forces of the peasantry—we want to do that, but we
    don’t want an alliance with
    Socialist-Revolutionaries. Comrade Manuilsky, like Comrades
    Drobnis and Bubnov, was, therefore, making an extremely strange
    mistake in asserting that I recommend a bloc with the Borotba
    Party. My opinion is that we must demonstrate that we need a bloc
    with the Ukrainian peasantry, and in order to achieve that bloc we
    must polemise with the Borotba people in away that differs from
    the present polemics. All those who spoke about the national
    question—Comrades Drobnis and Bubnov and many others spoke
    about it—show by their criticism of the C.C. resolution that
    they are pursuing the very same policy of
    “independence” we reproved the Kiev people
    for. Comrade Manuilsky is making a peculiar mistake in thinking
    that we accused them of independence in the national sense, in the
    sense of Ukrainian self-determination. We reproved them for their
    “independence” in the sense of their not wanting to
    consider Moscow’s views, the views of the Central Committee
    in Moscow. The word was used jokingly and had a completely
    different meaning.
The issue is now the following. Do we need a bloc with the
    Ukrainian peasantry, do we need a policy of the.type we needed at
    the end of 1917 and for many months in 1918? I maintain that we do
    and that for this reason most of the state farms must be handed
    over for actual distribution. We need a struggle against kulak
    farms, we need a struggle against petty-bourgeois prejudices, we
    need a struggle against the guerrilla bands. The Borotba Party
    talk a lot about the national question but they say nothing about
    the guerrillas. We must demand that the Borotba people disband the
    teachers’ union even though it uses the Ukrainian language
    and bears the state seal of the Ukraine—it must be disbanded
    for the sake of those principles of proletarian communist policy
    for which we disbanded our own All-Russia Teachers’ Union;
    we disbanded it because it did not implement the principles of
    proletarian dictatorship but defended the interests and pursued
    the policy of the petty bourgeoisie.

    The Conference was held in Moscow, and was attended by 45
    delegates with the right to vote. The agenda consisted of the
    following items: (1) Report of the CC.; (2) Report on the
    international situation; (3) The agenda of the Seventh All-Russia
    Congress of Soviets (state organisation); (4) Soviet power in the
    Ukraine; (5) The Party Rules; (6) Work with new Party members; (7)
    Fuel question.
Lenin directed the work of the Conference. He
    made a speech at the opening session, delivered the political
    report of the C.C. of the Party and closed the debate on it. Lenin
    spoke on Soviet power in the Ukraine and closed the discussion on
    this subject. The Conference delegates unanimously approved the
    C.C. political line and organisational work. Chicherin, People's
    Commissar for Foreign Affairs, delivered a detailed report on the
    international situation explaining the foreign policy of the
    Soviet state and the efforts being made for the immediate
    conclusion of peace. Another important question discussed at the
    Conference was state organisation. M. F. Vladimirsky made a report
    on this subject on behalf of the CC., R.C.P.(B, and T. V. Sapronov
    delivered a co-report. Vladimirsky summed up the results in
    organising the Soviet state and submitted concrete proposals for
    amending the Constitution of the R.S.F.S.R. Sapronov, Osinsky and
    their adherents opposed the C.C. line; they rejected one-man
    management and demanded preservation of “ the unlimited
    corporate principle” . This group of opportunists tried to
    impose their views on the Conference, which would have undermined
    centralism and the leading role of the Party in the Soviets. The
    Conference rejected the views of Sapronov and his followers as
    being contrary to the interests of the Party, and approved Lenin's
    principle of democratic centralism in the organisation of
    government bodies and in the interrelations of those bodies.
The Conference adopted a number of decisions
    directed at consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and
    at involving working masses in Soviet state development.
The Conference adopted new Party Rules which
    contained a new section on “Candidates” to Party
    Membership" introducing a probationary period for all new members,
    the length of which depended on social category; it was two months
    for factory workers and peasants, and no less than six months for
    other categories. A new section on “Groups in the
    Extra-Party Institutions and Organisations” was added to the
    Party Rules in order to spread Party influence to the extra-Party
    organisations and institutions, conduct them in accordance with
    the Party line and establish Party control over their
    activities. The new Party Rules had a special section on
    “Party Discipline” , which stated that strict
    observance of Party discipline was the prime duty of all Party
    members and all Party organisations.
The Conference approved the “Theses on
    the Employment of New Party Members” which outlined measures
    to raise the educational and ideological level of Communists, give
    them military training, and strengthen Party discipline. The
    Eighth Party Conference was of great significance; it summed up
    the experience gained by the Party in the two-year struggle to
    consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and implement the
    decisions of the Eighth Party Congress. The decisions of the
    Seventh All-Russia Congress of Soviets were based on the
    Conference's decisions on state, economic and military
    organisation.

    Lenin refers to the Seventh All-Russia Congress of Soviets held
    from December 5 to 9, 1919 in Moscow.
[3]
    Lenin refers to Folkets Dagblad Politikem, a newspaper of the
    Swedish Left Social-Democrats, who in 1917 founded the Left
    Social-Democratic Party of Sweden. It was published in Stockholm
    from April 1916, at first every other day, subsequently, daily (up
    to November 1917 it appeared under the name Politiken). In 1918-19
it was edited by Fredrik Strom. In 1921 the Left Social-Democratic Party joined the Communist International and became the Communist Party of Sweden, and the newspaper became its Central Organ.After the Communist Party of Sweden split in October 1929 the newspaper was taken over by the Right wing. Its publication 
ceased in May 1945.

    Lenin refers to the article "Finland and the Bolshevists",
    published in The Times No. 42239 on October 24, 1919.

    This refers to the resolution of the Ninth Council of the
    S.R. Party On the Attitude to the Red Army published in
    the Supplement to Lislok Dyela Naroda No, 2.

    Lenin refers to N. P. Rostopchin's article Peasants—
    Non-Party
Conferences published in Pravda No. 20 on November 20, 1919.
[7]
    The Draft Instructions to Gubernia, Uyezd and Volost Committees of
    the R.C.P. on Work in the Countryside were drawn up by the
    relevant department of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) and published for
    discussion in Bulletin of the C .C., R.C.P.(B.) on September 20,
    1919; it defined the duties of local Party organisers who were to
    secure help for local peasants from neighbouring state farms and
    farming co-operatives. The draft was adopted with slight
    amendments by the First All-Russia Conference on Party Work in the
    Countryside and finally endorsed by the Eighth All-Russia
    Conference of the R.C.P.(B.).
[8]
    The draft resolution on foreign policy was written by Lenin at the
    session of the Eighth All-Russia Conference of the R.C.P.(B.),
    December 2, 1919. It was adopted by the Conference with slight
    amendments, and afterwards (on December 5) read out by Lenin in
    his report at the Seventh All-Russia Congress of Soviets (see
    p. 231 of this volume), which adopted it unanimously as a peace
    proposal to the countries of the Entente. The resolution of the
    Congress was published in the press on December 6, 1919. The peace
    proposal of the Congress was sent to the Entente 
powers on December 10, 1919. The governments of Britain, France, the U.S.A. and Italy refused to examine it.

Comrades, I am very glad to greet your first congress of agricultural communes and agricultural artels on. behalf of the government. Of course, from, all the activities of. the Soviet government you know what tremendous signifi-cance we attach to the communes, artels, and all organisations generally that aim at transforming and at gradually assisting the transformation of small, individual peasant farming into socialised, co-operative, or artel farming. You are aware that the Soviet government long ago allotted the sum of one thousand million rubles to assist efforts of this kind.[2] The Statute on Socialist Agrarian Measures[3] particularly stresses the significance of communes, artels, and all enterprises for the joint cultivation of the land, and the Soviet government is exerting every effort to ensure that this law shall not remain on paper only, but shall really produce the benefits it is intended to produce.
The importance of all enterprises of this kind is tremendous, because if the old, poverty-stricken peasant farming remains unchanged there can be no question of building up a stable socialist society. Only if we succeed in proving to the peasants in practice the advantages of common, collective, co-operative, artel cultivation of the soil, only if we succeed in helping the peasant by means of co-operative or artel farming, will the working class, which wields state power, be really able to convince the peasant that its policy is correct and thus secure the real and lasting following of the millions fulfilling the letter of the law, such assistance will be not only useless but harmful. For the name “agricultural commune” is a great one; it is associated with the conception of communism. It will be a good thing if the communes show in practice that they are indeed seriously working for the improvement of peasant farming; that will undoubtedly enhance the prestige of the Communists and the Communist Party. But it has frequently happened that the communes have only succeeded in provoking a negative attitude among the peasantry, and the word “commune” has even at times become a call to fight communism. And this happened not only when stupid attempts were made to drive the peasants into the communes by force. The absurdity of this was so obvious that the Soviet government long ago forbade it. And I hope that if isolated examples of such coercion are to be met with now, they are very few, and that you will take advantage of the present congress to see to it that the last trace of this outrage is swept from the face of the Soviet Republic, and that the neighbouring peasant population may not be able to point to a single instance in support of the old opinion that membership of a commune is in one way or another associated with coercion.
But even if we eliminate this old shortcoming, completely suppress this outrage, it will still be only a small fraction of what has to be done. For it will still be necessary for the state to help the communes, and we would not be Communists and champions. of socialist economy if we did not give state aid to every kind of collective agricultural enterprise. We must do so because it is in accordance with all our aims, and because we know perfectly well that these co-operatives, artels, and collective organisations are innovations, and if support is not given them by the working class in power they will not take root. In order that they should take root, and in view of the fact that the state is affording them monetary and every other kind of support, we must see to it that they do not provoke the ridicule of the peasants. What we must be most careful about is that the peasants should not say of members of communes, artels and co-operatives that they. are state pensioners, that they differ from the peasants only by the fact that they are receiving privileges. If we are to give land and subsidies for building purposes ou of the thousand-million-ruble fund, any fool will live somewhat better than the ordinary peasant. What is. there communistic here; the peasant will ask, and where is the improvement? What are we to respect them for? If you pick out a few score or a few hundred individuals and give them a thousand million, of course they will work.
Such an attitude on the part of the peasants is most to be feared, and .1 should like to draw the attention of the comrades assembled at the congress to this. The problem must be solved practically, so as to enable us to say that we have not only averted this danger, but have also found means whereby the peasant will not be led to think in this way, but will, on the contrary, find in every commune and artel something which the state is assisting, will find in them new methods of farming which show their advantages over the old methods not by books and speeches (that is not worth much) but in practice. That is why the problem is so difficult to solve, and that is why it is hard for us, who have only dry figures before us, to judge whether we have proved in practice that every commune and every artel is really superior to every enterprise of the old system and that the workers’ government is here helping the peasant.
I think that for the practical solution of this problem, it would be very desirable for you, who have a practical acquaintance with a number of neighbouring communes, artels and co-operatives, to work out real, practical methods for the verification of the implementation of the law demanding that the agricultural communes give assistance to the surrounding population, the way the transition to socialist farming is being put into effect and what concrete forms it is taking in each commune, artel and co-operative farm, how it is actually being put into practice, how many co-operatives and communes are in fact putting it into practice, and how many are only preparing to do so, how many cases have been observed when the communes have given assistance, and what character this assistance bears philanthropic or socialist.
If out of the aid given them by the state the communes and artels set aside a portion for the peasants, that will only give the peasants grounds for believing that they are merely being helped by kind-hearted people, but will not by any means be proof of transition to a socialist system. The peasants have for ages been accustomed to regard such “kind-hearted people” with suspicion. We must know how to keep a check on the way this new social order has manifested itself, by what methods it is being proved to the peasants that co-operative, artel cultivation of the soil is better than individual peasant farming, and that it is better not because of state aid. We must be able to show the peasants the practical realisation of this new order even without state aid.
Unfortunately, I shall not be able to stay till the end of your congress and I shall therefore be unable to take part in elaborating these methods of control. But I am certain that with the aid of the comrades in charge of our Commissariat of Agriculture you will succeed in finding these methods. I have read with great satisfaction an article by the People’s Commissar of Agriculture, Comrade Sereda, in which he stresses that the communes and co-operatives must not isolate themselves from the surrounding peasant population but must endeavour to improve the latter’s farms. A commune must be organised so that it will serve as a model, and the neighbouring peasants will be attracted to it. We must be able to set them a practical example of how to assist people who are running their farms under the difficult conditions of a shortage of goods and general economic chaos. In order to define the practical methods of effecting this, instructions must be drawn up in the greatest detail and should enumerate all forms of assistance that can be given to neighbouring peasants; the instructions should ask each commune to give an account of what it has done to help the peasants, and indicate methods whereby each of the existing two thousand communes and nearly four thousand artels may become a nucleus capable of strengthening the peasants’ conviction that collective farming, as a form of transition to socialism, Is something of benefit to them, and not a whim or the ravings of a disordered mind.
I have already said that the law requires the communes to render assistance to the surrounding peasant population. We could not express ourselves otherwise in the law, or give any practical instructions in it. It was our business to establish the general principles, and to count on politically-conscious comrades in the localities scrupulously applying the law and being able to find a thousand ways of applying it practically in the concrete economic conditions of each given locality. But, of course, every law can be evaded, even under pretence, of observing it. And so the law on assisting the peasants, if it is not scrupulously applied, may become a mere game, and lead to results quite contrary to those intended.
The communes must develop in such a way that peasant farming conditions will begin to change by contact with them and by the economic help they give, so that every commune, artel, and co-operative will be able to make the beginnings of an improvement in these conditions and put them into effect, thereby proving to the peasants in practice that this change can be only of benefit to them.
Naturally, you may think we shall be told that in order to improve farming we need conditions that differ from the present economic chaos caused by four years of imperialist war and the two years of civil war forced on us by the imperialists. With such conditions as now exist in our country, how can one think of any widespread improvement in farming—God grant that we may carry on somehow and not die of starvation!
It will be only natural for doubts of this kind to be expressed. But if I had to reply to such objections, I would say this: assume that owing to the disorganisation of economic life, to economic chaos, goods shortage, poor transport and the destruction of cattle and implements, an extensive improvement of farming cannot be effected. But there is no doubt that a certain, not extensive, improvement is possible in a number of individual cases. But let us assume that even this cannot be done. Does that mean that the communes cannot produce changes in the life of the neighbouring peasants and cannot prove to the peasants that collective agricultural enterprises are not an artificial, hothouse growth, but a new form of assistance to the working peasants on the part of the workers’ government, and an aid to the working peasants in their struggle against the kulaks? I am convinced that even if the matter is regarded in this way, even if we grant the impossibility of effecting improvements under the present conditions of economic chaos, a very great deal may nevertheless be accomplished if there are conscientious Communists in the communes and artels. To bear this out, I would refer to what in our cities has been called subbotniks. This is the name given to the several hours’ unpaid voluntary work done by city workers over and above the usual working day and devoted to some public need. The subbotniks were initiated in Moscow by the workers of the Moscow-Kazan Railway. One of the appeals of the Soviet government pointed out that the Red Army men at the front are making unprecedented sacrifices, and that, in spite of all the hardships they are obliged to undergo, they are gaining unprecedented victories over our enemies, and at the same time stated that we can clinch our victories only if such heroism and such self-sacrifice are displayed not only at the front, but also in the rear. The Moscow workers responded to this appeal by organising subbotniks. There can be no doubt that the workers of Moscow are experiencing greater privation and want than the peasants. If you were to acquaint yourselves with their conditions of life and give some thought to the fact that in spite of these incredibly hard conditions they were able to organise subbotniks, you would agree that no reference to arduous conditions can serve as an excuse for not doing what can be done under any conditions by applying the method of the Moscow workers. Nothing helped so much to enhance the prestige of the Communist Party in the towns, to increase the respect of non-party workers for the Communists, as these subbotniks when they ceased to be isolated instances and when non-party workers saw in practice that the members of the governing Communist Party have obligations and duties, and that the Communists admit new members to the Party not in order that they may enjoy the advantages connected with the position of a governing party, but that they may set an example of real communist labour, i.e., labour performed gratis. Communism is the highest stage in the development of socialism, when people work because they realise the necessity of working for the common good. We know that we cannot establish a socialist order now—God grant that it may be established in our country in our children’s time, or perhaps in our grandchildren’s time. But we say that the members of the governing Communist Party assume the greater burden of the difficulties in the fight against capitalism, mobilise the best Communists for the front, and demand of such as cannot be used for this purpose that they take part in subbotniks.
By organising these subbotniks, which have become widespread in every large industrial city, participation in which the Party now demands from every one of its members, punishing non-fulfilment even by expulsion from the Party̬by applying this method in the communes, artels, and co-operatives, you can, and must, even under the very worst conditions, see to it that the peasant regards every commune, artel, and co-operative as an association which is distinguished not by the fact that it receives state subsidies, but by the fact that within it are gathered some of the best working-class people who not only preach socialism for others, but are themselves capable of realising it, who are capable of showing that even under the worst conditions they can conduct their farms on communist lines and help the surrounding peasant population in every possible way. On this question there can be no such excuses as the goods shortage, or absence of seed, or loss of cattle. This will be a test which, at all events, will enable us to say definitely to what extent the difficult task we have taken on ourselves has been carried out in practice.
I am certain that this general meeting of representatives of communes, co-operatives and artels will discuss this and will realise that the application of this method will really serve as a powerful instrument for the consolidation of the communes and co-operatives, and will achieve such practical results that nowhere in Russia will there be a single case of hostility towards the communes, artels, and co-operatives on the part of the peasants. But that is not enough. What is required is that the peasants should show a sympathetic attitude towards them. For our part, we representatives of the Soviet government will do everything in our power to help to bring this about and to see to it that state assistance from the thousand-million-ruble fund, or from other sources, shall be forthcoming only in cases when the labour communes or artels have actually established closer contacts with the life of their peasant neighbours. Unless these conditions are fulfilled, we consider any assistance given to the artels and the co-operatives not only useless, but definitely harmful. Assistance given by the communes to the neighbouring peasants must not be regarded as assistance which is merely given out of superfluity; this assistance must be socialist assistance, i. e., it must enable the peasants to replace their isolated, individual farming by co-operative farming. And this can be done only by the subbotnik method of which I have here spoken.
If you learn from the experience of the city workers, who, although living in conditions immeasurably worse than those of the peasants, initiated the movement for subbotniks, I am certain that, with your general and unanimous support, we shall bring about a situation when each of the several thousand existing communes and artels will become a genuine nursery for communist ideas and views among the peasants, a practical example showing them that, although it is still a small and feeble growth, it is nevertheless not an artificial, hothouse growth, but a true growth of the new socialist system. Only then shall we gain a lasting victory over the old ignorance, impoverishment and want, and only then will the difficulties we meet in our future course hold out no terrors for us.

[1] The First Congress of Agricultural Communes and Agricultural Artels was convened by the People's Commissariat of Agriculture and was held December 3-10, 1919 in Moscow. The Congress was attended by 140 delegates, of whom 93 were Communists. Lenin spoke on the second day of the Congress. The Congress adopted the Rules of the All-Russia Association of Agricultural Producers' Collectives (Communes and Artels), which were later endorsed by the People's Commissariat of Agriculture. The Rules stated that the main objects of the Association were the union of all agricultural collectives in a single producers' association, propaganda of the idea of collective farming and practical help for the neighbouring peasantry, especially the poor peasants and the families of Red Army men.


[2] The thousand-million-ruble fund was established by a decree of the Council of People's Commissars dated November 2, 1918 for the purpose of improving and developing agriculture and for its speediest reconstruction on socialist lines". Grants and loans from this fund were given to farming communes, producers' co-operatives and village societies and groups of peasants, provided they went over to collective farming. The People's Commissars of Agriculture and of Finance elaborated detailed rules for granting loans to develop agriculture (see Izvestia No. 42, February 23, 1919). 


[3] The Statute on Socialist Land Settlement and the Measures for the Transition to Socialist Farming was adopted by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee in February 1919. It tool; for its basis the decisions of the First All-Russia Congress of Land Departments, Poor Peasants' Committees and Communes, held in December 1918. Lenin directly participated in drafting and editing the Statute. It outlined a number of measures for the reconstruction of agriculture on a socialist basis, for raising agricultural productivity and extending the areas under crops. The Statute reads, "In order to put an end to all exploitation of man by man, to reconstruct agriculture on a socialist basis, to apply all the achievements of science and technology, to educate the working masses in the spirit of socialism and to unite the proletariat and poor peasants in their struggle against capital, it is necessary to go over from individual to collective forms of land tenure. Large state farms and communes, collective tilling and other types of collective work are the best ways of attaining this purpose, therefore all forms of individual land tenure should be regarded as transitory and outliving themselves" (Izvestia No. 34, February 14, 1919).

Comrades, four months ago, towards the end of August 1919, I had occasion to address a letter to the workers and peasants in connection with the victory over Kolchak.
I am now having this letter reprinted in full for the workers and peasants of the Ukraine in connection with the victories over Denikin.
Red troops have taken Kiev, Poltava and Kharkov and are advancing victoriously on Rostov. The Ukraine is seething with revolt against Denikin. All forces must he rallied for the final rout of Denikin’s army, which has been trying to restore the power of the landowners and capitalists. We must destroy Denikin to safeguard ourselves against even the slightest possibility of a new incursion.
The workers and peasants of the Ukraine should familiarise themselves with the lessons which all Russian workers and peasants have drawn from the conquest of Siberia by Kolchak and her liberation by Red troops after many months of landowner and capitalist tyranny.
Denikin’s rule in the Ukraine has been as severe an ordeal as Kolchak’s rule was in Siberia. There can be no doubt that the lessons of this severe ordeal will give the Ukrainian workers and peasants—as they did the workers and peasants of the Urals and Siberia—a clearer understanding of the tasks of Soviet power and induce them to defend it more staunchly.
In Great Russia the system of landed estates has been completely abolished. The same must be done in the Ukraine, and the Soviet power of the Ukrainian workers and peasants must effect the complete abolition of the landed estates and the complete liberation of the Ukrainian workers and peasants from all oppression by the landowners, and from the landowners themselves.
But apart from this task, and a number of others which confronted and still confront both the Great-Russian and the Ukrainian working masses, Soviet power in the Ukraine has its own special tasks. One of these special tasks deserves the greatest attention at the present moment. It is the national question, or, in other words, the question of whether the Ukraine is to be a separate and independent Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic bound in alliance (federation) with the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, or whether the Ukraine is to amalgamate with Russia to form a single Soviet republic. All Bolsheviks and all politically-conscious workers and peasants must give careful thought to this question.
The independence of the Ukraine has been recognised both by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of the R.S.F.S.R. (Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic) and by the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). It is therefore self-evident and generally recognised that only the Ukrainian workers and peasants themselves can and will decide at their All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets whether the Ukraine shall amalgamate with Russia, or whether she shall remain a separate and independent republic, and, in the latter case, what federal ties shall be established between that republic and Russia.
How should this question be decided insofar as concerns the interests of the working people and the promotion of their fight for the complete emancipation of labour from the yoke of capital?
In the first place, the interests of labour demand the fullest confidence and the closest alliance among the working people of different countries and nations. The supporters of the landowners and capitalists, of the bourgeoisie, strive to disunite the workers, to intensify national discord and enmity, in order to weaken the workers and strengthen the power of capital.
Capital is an international force. To vanquish it, an international workers’ alliance, an international workers’ brotherhood, is needed.
We are opposed to national enmity and discord, to national exclusiveness. We are internationalists. We stand for the close union and the complete amalgamation of the workers and peasants of all nations in a single world Soviet republic.
Secondly, the working people must not forget that capitalism has divided nations into a small number of oppressor, Great-Power (imperialist), sovereign and privileged nations and an overwhelming majority of oppressed, dependent and semi-dependent, non-sovereign nations. The arch-criminal and arch-reactionary war of 1914-18 still further accentuated this division and as a result aggravated rancour and hatred. For centuries the indignation and distrust of the non-sovereign and dependent nations towards the dominant and oppressor nations have been accumulating, of nations such as the Ukrainian towards nations such as the Great-Russian.
We want a voluntary union of nations—a union which precludes any coercion of one nation by another—a union founded on complete confidence, on a clear recognition of brotherly unity, on absolutely voluntary consent. Such a union cannot be effected at one stroke; we have to work towards it with the greatest patience and circumspection, so as not to spoil matters and not to arouse distrust, and so that the distrust inherited from centuries of landowner and capitalist oppression, centuries of private property and the enmity caused by its divisions and redivisions may have a chance to wear off.
We must, therefore, strive persistently for the unity of nations and ruthlessly suppress everything that tends to divide them, and in doing so we must be very cautious and patient, and make concessions to the survivals of national distrust. We must be adamant and uncompromising towards everything that affects the fundamental interests of labour in its fight for emancipation from the yoke of capital. The question of the demarcation of frontiers now, for the time being—for we are striving towards the complete abolition of frontiers—is a minor one, it is not fundamental or important. In this matter we can afford to wait, and must wait, because the national distrust among the broad mass of peasants and small owners is often extremely tenacious, and haste might only intensify it, in other words, jeopardise the cause of complete and ultimate unity.
The experience of the workers’ and peasants’ revolution in Russia, the revolution of October-November 1917, and of the two years of victorious struggle against the onslaught of international and Russian capitalists, has made it crystal clear that the capitalists have succeeded for a time in playing upon the national distrust of the Great Russians felt by Polish, Latvian, Estonian and Finnish peasants and small owners, that they have succeeded for a time in sowing dissension between them and us on the basis of this distrust. Experience has shown that this distrust wears off and disappears only very slowly, and that the more caution and patience displayed by the Great Russians, who have for so long been an oppressor nation, the more certainly this distrust will pass. It is by recognising the independence of the Polish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Estonian and Finnish states that we are slowly but steadily winning the confidence of the labouring masses of the neighbouring small states, who were more backward and more deceived and downtrodden by the capitalists. It is the surest way of wresting them from the influence of "their" national capitalists, and leading them to full confidence, to the future united international Soviet republic.
As long as the Ukraine is not completely liberated from Denikin, her government, until the All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets meets, is the All-Ukraine Revolutionary Committee.[1] Besides the Ukrainian Bolshevik Communists, there are Ukrainian Borotba Communists working on this Revolutionary Committee as members of the government. One of the things distinguishing the Borotbists from the Bolsheviks is that they insist upon the unconditional independence of the Ukraine. The Bolsheviks will not make this a subject of difference and disunity, they do not regard this as an obstacle to concerted proletarian effort. There must be unity in the struggle against the yoke of capital and for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and there should be no parting of the ways among Communists on the question of national frontiers, or whether there should be a federal or some other tie between the states. Among the Bolsheviks there are advocates of complete independence for the Ukraine, advocates of a more or less close federal tie, and advocates of the complete amalgamation of the Ukraine with Russia.
There must be no differences over these questions. They will be decided by the All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets.
If a Great-Russian Communist insists upon the amalgamation of the Ukraine with Russia, Ukrainians might easily suspect him of advocating this policy not from the motive of uniting the proletarians in the fight against capital, but because of the prejudices of the old Great-Russian nationalism, of imperialism. Such mistrust is natural, and to a certain degree inevitable and legitimate, because the Great Russians, under the yoke of the landowners and capitalists, had for centuries imbibed the shameful and disgusting prejudices of Great-Russian chauvinism.
If a Ukrainian Communist insists upon the unconditional state independence of the Ukraine, he lays himself open to the suspicion that he is supporting this policy not because of the temporary interests of the Ukrainian workers and peasants in their struggle against the yoke of capital, but on account of the petty-bourgeois national prejudices of the small owner. Experience has provided hundreds of instances of the petty-bourgeois "socialists" of various countries—all the various Polish, Latvian and Lithuanian pseudo-socialists, Georgian Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and the like—assuming the guise of supporters of the proletariat for the sole purpose of deceitfully promoting a policy of compromise with “their” national bourgeoisie against the revolutionary workers. We saw this in the case of Kerensky’s rule in Russia in the February-October period of 1917, and we have seen it and are seeing it in all other countries.
Mutual distrust between the Great-Russian and Ukrainian Communists can, therefore, arise very easily. How is this distrust to be combated? How is it to be overcome and mutual confidence established?
The best way to achieve this is by working together to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet power in the fight against the landowners and capitalists of all countries and against their attempts to restore their domination. This common fight will clearly show in practice that whatever the decision in regard to state independence or frontiers may be, there must be a close military and economic alliance between the Great-Russian and Ukrainian workers, for otherwise the capitalists of the “Entente”, in other words, the alliance of the richest capitalist countries—Britain, France, America, Japan and Italy—will crush and strangle us separately. Our fight against Kolchak and Denikin, whom these capitalists supplied with money and arms, is a clear illustration of this danger.
He who undermines the unity and closest alliance between the Great-Russian and Ukrainian workers and peasants is helping the Kolchaks, the Denikins, the capitalist bandits of all countries.
Consequently, we Great-Russian Communists must repress with the utmost severity the slightest manifestation in our midst of Great-Russian nationalism, for such manifestations, which are a betrayal of communism in general, cause the gravest harm by dividing us from our Ukrainian comrades and thus playing into the hands of Denikin and his regime.
Consequently, we Great-Russian Communists must make concessions when there are differences with the Ukrainian Bolshevik Communists and Borotbists and these differences concern the state independence of the Ukraine, the forms of her alliance with Russia, and the national question in general. But all of us, Great-Russian Communists, Ukrainian Communists, and Communists of any other nation, must be unyielding and irreconcilable in the underlying and fundamental questions which are the same for all nations, in questions of the proletarian struggle, of the proletarian dictatorship; we must not tolerate compromise with the bourgeoisie or any division of the forces which are protecting us against Denikin.
Denikin must be vanquished and destroyed, and such incursions as his not allowed to recur. That is to the fundamental interest of both the Great-Russian and the Ukrainian workers and peasants. The fight will be a long and hard one, for the capitalists of the whole world are helping Denikin and will help all other Denikius.
In this long and hard fight we Great-Russian and Ukrainian workers must maintain the closest alliance, for separately we shall most definitely be unable to cope with the task. Whatever the boundaries of the Ukraine and Russia may be, whatever may be the forms of their mutual state relationships, that is not so important; that is a matter in which concessions can and should be made, in which one thing, or another, or a third may be tried—the cause of the workers and peasants, of the victory over capitalism, will not perish because of that.
But if we fail to maintain the closest alliance, an alliance against Denikin, an alliance against the capitalists and kulaks of our countries and of all countries, the cause of labour will most certainly perish for many years to come in the sense that the capitalists will be able to crush and strangle both the Soviet Ukraine and Soviet Russia.
And what the bourgeoisie of all countries, and all manner of petty-bourgeois parties, i.e., “compromising” parties which permit alliance with the bourgeoisie against the workers—try most of all to accomplish is to disunite the workers of different nationalities, to evoke distrust, and to disrupt a close international alliance and international brotherhood of the workers. Whenever the bourgeoisie succeeds in this the cause of the workers is lost. The Communists of Russia and the Ukraine must therefore by patient, persistent, stubborn and concerted effort foil the nationalist machinations of the bourgeoisie and vanquish nationalist prejudices of every kind, and set the working people of the world an example of a really solid alliance of the workers and peasants of different nations in the fight for Soviet power, for the overthrow of the yoke of the landowners and capitalists, and for a world federal Soviet republic.

[1] The All-Ukraine Revolutionary Military Committee was a provisional revolutionary government in the Ukraine set up by decision of the C.E.C. and C.P.C. of the Ukraine on December 11, 1919 (the day Poltava and Kharkov were liberated). Among its members were G. I. Petrovsky (Chairman) and V. P. Zatonsky and D. Z. Manuilsky. The Committee was entrusted with the functions of the C.E.C. and C.P.C. of the Ukraine and was to give all-round assistance to the Red Army in finally routing the whiteguards; its tasks included abolition of land proprietorship; establishment of strong workers’ and peasants’ power on the territory of Soviet Ukraine; convocation of the Fourth All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets immediately after the liberation of the greater part of the Ukrainian lands.

1. Do we intend to attack Poland and Rumania?
No. We have declared most emphatically and officially, in the name of the Council of People’s Commissars and the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, our peaceful intentions. It is very much to be regretted that the French capitalist government is instigating Poland (and presumably Rumania, too) to attack us. This is even, mentioned by a number of American radios from Lyons.
2. What are our plans in Asia?
They are the same as in Europe: peaceful coexistence with all peoples; with the workers and peasants of all nations awakening to a new life—a life without exploiters, without landowners, without capitalists, without merchants. The imperialist war of 1914-18, the war of the capitalists of the Anglo-French (and Russian) group against the German-Austrian capitalist group for the partition of the world, has awakened Asia and has strengthened there, as everywhere else, the urge towards freedom, towards peaceful labour and against possible future wars.
3. What would be the basis of peace with America?
Let the American capitalists leave us alone. We shall not touch them. We are even ready to pay them in gold for any machinery, tools, etc., useful to our transport and industries. We are ready to pay not only in gold, but in raw materials too.
4. What are the obstacles to such a peace?
None on our part; imperialism on the part of the Ameri-can (and of any other) capitalists.
5. What are our views of the deportation of Russian revo-lutionaries from America?
We have accepted them. We are not afraid of revolution-aries here in this country. As a matter of fact, we are not afraid of anybody, and if America is afraid of a few more hundred or thousand of its citizens, we are ready to begin negotiations with a view of receiving any citizens whom Amer-ica thinks dangerous (with the exception of criminals, of course).
6. What possibilities are there of an economic alliance between Russia and Germany?
Unfortunately, they are not great. The Scheidemanns are bad allies. We stand for an alliance with all countries without exception.
7. What are our views upon the allied demand for the extradition of war criminals?
If we are to speak seriously on this matter of war guilt, the guilty ones are the capitalists of all countries. Hand over to us all your landed proprietors owning more than a hundred hectares and capitalists having a capital of more than 100,000 francs, and we shall educate them. to useful labour and make them break with the shameful, base and bloody role of exploiters and instigators of wars for the par-tition of colonies. Wars will then soon become absolutely impossible .
8. What would be the influence of peace with Russia upon the economic conditions in Europe?
Exchange of machinery for grain, flax and other raw materials—1 ask, can this he disadvantageous for Europe? Clearly, it cannot be anything but beneficial.
9. What is our opinion regarding the future development of the Soviets as a world force?
The future belongs to the Soviet system all the world over. The facts have proved it. One has only to count by quarterly periods, say, the growth in the number of pamphlets, books, leaflets and newspapers standing for or sympathising with the Soviets published in any country. It cannot be other-wise. Once the workers in the cities, the workers, landless peasants and the handicraftsmen in the villages as well as the small peasants (i.e., those who do not exploit hired labour)—once this enormous majority of working people have understood that the Soviet system gives all power into their hands, releasing them from the yoke of landlords and capitalists—how could one prevent the victory of the Soviet system all over the world? I, for one, do not know of any means of preventing it.
10. Has Russia still to fear counter-revolution from without?
Unfortunately, it has, for the capitalists are stupid, greedy people. They have made a number of such stupid, greedy attempts at intervention and one has to fear repe-titions until the workers and peasants of all countries thor-oughly re—educate their own capitalists.
11. Is Russia ready to enter into business relations with America?
Of course she is ready to do so, and with all other coun-tries. Peace with Estonia, to whom we have conceded a great deal, has proved our readiness, for the sake of business relations, to give even industrial concessions on certain conditions.

 Opening Speech
March 29
 First of all allow me on behalf of the Central
    Committee of the Russian Communist Party to greet the delegates
    who have assembled for the Party Congress.
Comrades, we are opening this present Congress of the Party at
    a highly important moment. The internal development of our
    revolution has led to very big and rapid victories over the enemy
    in the Civil War, and, in view of the international situation,
    these victories, we find, are nothing more nor less than the
    victory of the Soviet revolution in the first country to make this
    revolution—a very weak and backward country—a victory
    over the combined forces of world capitalism and imperialism. And
    after these victories we may now proceed with calm and firm
    assurance to the immediate tasks of peaceful economic development,
    confident that the present Congress, having reviewed the
    experience of over two years of Soviet work, will be able to
    utilise the lesson gained in order to cope with the more difficult
    and complex task of economic development that now confronts
    us. From the international standpoint, our position has never been
    as favourable as it is now; and what fills us with particular joy
    and vigour is the news we are daily receiving from Germany, which
    shows that, however difficult and painful the birth of a socialist
    revolution may be, the proletarian Soviet power in Germany is
    spreading irresistibly. The part played by the German
    Kornilov-type putsch was similar to that of Kornilov revolt in
    Russia. After that a swing towards a workers’ government
    began, not only among the masses of urban workers, but also among
    the rural proletariat of Ger- many. And this swing is of historic
    importance. Not only is it one more absolute confirmation of the
    correctness of the line, but it gives us the assurance that the
    time is not far off when we shall be marching hand in hand with a
    German Soviet government. (Applause.) 
 I hereby open the Congress and request you to nominate a
    presidium. 
    

2
Report Of The Central Committee
March 29
 Comrades, before beginning my report I must say that, like the
    report at the preceding Congress, it is divided into two parts:
    political and organisational. This division first of all leads one
    to think of the way the work of the Central Committee has
    developed in its external aspect, the organisational aspect. Our
    Party has now been through its first year without Y. M. Sverdlov,
    and our loss was bound to tell on the whole organisation of the
    Central Committee. No one has been able to combine organisational
    and political work in one person so successfully as Comrade
    Sverdlov did and we have been obliged to attempt to replace his
    work by the work of a collegium.
During the year under review the current daily work of the
    Central Committee has been conducted by the two collegiums elected
    by the plenary meeting of the Central Committee—the
    Organising Bureau of the Central Committee and the Political
    Bureau of the Central Committee. In order to achieve co-ordination
    and consistency in the decisions of these two bodies, the
    Secretary was a member of both. In practice it has become the main
    and proper function of the Organising Bureau to distribute the
    forces of the Party, and that of the Political Bureau to deal with
    political questions. It goes without saying that this distinction
    is to a certain extent artificial; it is obvious that no policy
    can be carried out in practice without finding expression in
    appointments and transfers. Consequently, every organisational
    question assumes a political significance; and it has become the
    established practice for the request of a single member of the
    Central Committee to be sufficient to have any question, for one
    reason or another, examined as a political question. To have
    attempted to divide the functions of the Central Committee in any
    other way would hardly have been expedient and in practice would
    hardly have achieved its purpose.
This method of conducting business has produced extremely good
    results: no difficulties have arisen between the two bureaus on
    any occasion. The work of these bodies has on the whole proceeded
    harmoniously, and practical implementation has been facilitated by
    the presence of the Secretary who acted, furthermore, solely and
    exclusively in pursuance of the will of the Central Committee. It
    must be emphasised from the very outset, so as to remove all
    misunderstanding, that only the corporate decisions of the Central
    Committee adopted in the Organising Bureau or the Political
    Bureau, or by a plenary meeting of the Central
    Committee—only these decisions were carried out by the
    Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party. The work of the
    Central Committee cannot otherwise proceed properly.
After these brief remarks on the arrangement of work within the
    Central Committee, I shall get on with my job, which is the report
    of the Central Committee. To present a report on the political
    work of the Central Committee is a highly difficult task if
    understood literally. A large part of the work of the Political
    Bureau has this year consisted in making the current decision on
    the various questions of policy that have arisen, questions of
    co-ordinating the activities of all the Soviet and Party
    institutions and all organisations of the working class, of
    co-ordinating and doing their utmost to direct the work of the
    entire Soviet Republic. The Political Bureau adopted decisions on
    all questions of foreign and domestic policy. Naturally, to
    attempt to enumerate these questions, even approximately, would be
    impossible. You will find material for a general summary in the
    printed matter prepared by the Central Committee for this
    Congress. To attempt to repeat this summary in my report would be
    beyond my powers, and I do not think it would be interesting to
    the delegates. All of us who work in a Party or Soviet
    organisation keep daily track of the extraordinary succession of
    political questions, both foreign and domestic. The way these
    questions have been decided, as expressed in the decrees of the
    Soviet government, and in the activities of the Party
    organisations, at every turn, is in itself an evaluation of the
    Central Committee of the Party. It must be said that the questions
    were so numerous that they frequently had to be decided under
    conditions of extreme haste, and it was only because the members
    of the body concerned were so well acquainted with each other,
    knew every shade of opinion and had confidence in each other, that
    this work could be done at all. Otherwise it would have been
    beyond the powers of a body even three times the size. When
    deciding complex questions it frequently happened that meetings
    had to be replaced by telephone conversations. This was done in
    the full assurance that obviously complicated and disputed
    questions would not be overlooked. Now, when I am called upon to
    make a general report, instead of giving a chronological review
    and a grouping of subjects, I shall take the liberty of dwelling
    on the main and most essential points, such, moreover, as link up
    the experience of yesterday, or, more correctly, of the past year,
    with the tasks that now confront us.
The time is not yet ripe for a history of Soviet
    government. And even if it were, I must say for myself—and I
    think for the Central Committee as well—that we have no
    intention of becoming historians. What interests us is the present
    and the future. We take the past year under review as material, as
    a lesson, as a stepping-stone, from which we must proceed
    further. Regarded from this point of view, the work of the Central
    Committee falls into two big categories—work connected with
    war problems and those determining the international position of
    the Republic, and work of internal, peace-time economic
    development, which only began to come to the fore at the end of
    the last year perhaps, or the beginning of this year, when it
    became quite clear that we had won a decisive victory on the
    decisive fronts of the Civil War. Last spring our military
    situation was an extremely difficult one; as you remember, we were
    still to experience quite a number of defeats, of new, huge and
    unexpected offensives on the part of the counter-revolution and
    the Entente, none of which could have been anticipated by us. It
    was therefore only natural that the greater part of this period
    was devoted to the military problem, the problem of the Civil War,
    which seemed unsolvable to all the faint-hearted, not to speak of
    the parties of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries and
    other petty-bourgeois democrats, and to all the intermediate
    elements; this induced them to declare quite sincerely that the
    problem could not be solved, that Russia was backward and
    enfeebled and could not vanquish the capitalist system of the
    entire world, seeing that the revolution in the West had been
    delayed. And we therefore had to maintain our position and to
    declare with absolute firmness and conviction that we would win,
    we had to implement the slogans “Everything for
    victory!” and “Everything for the war!”
To carry out these slogans it was necessary to deliberately and
    openly leave some of the most essential needs unsatisfied, and
    time and again to deny assistance to many, in the conviction that
    all forces had to be concentrated on the war, and that we had to
    win the war which the Entente had forced upon us. It was only
    because of the Party’s vigilance and its strict discipline,
    because the authority of the Party united all government
    departments and institutions, because the slogans issued by the
    Central Committee were adopted by tens, hundreds, thousands and
    finally millions of people as one man, because incredible
    sacrifices were made—it was only because of all this that
    the miracle which occurred was made possible. It was only because
    of all this that we were able to win in spite of the campaigns of
    the imperialists of the Entente and of the whole world having been
    repeated twice, thrice and even four times. And, of course, we not
    only stress this aspect of the matter; we must also bear in mind
    that it teaches us that without discipline and centralisation we
    would never have accomplished this task. The incredible sacrifices
    that we have made in order to save the country from
    counter-revolution and in order to ensure the victory of the
    Russian revolution over Denikin, Yudenich and Kolchak are a
    guarantee of the world social revolution. To achieve this, we had
    to have Party discipline, the strictest centralisation and the
    absolute certainty that the untold sacrifices of tens and hundreds
    of thousands of people would help us to accomplish all these
    tasks, and that it really could be done, could be
    accomplished. And for this purpose it was essential that our Party
    and the class which is exercising the dictatorship, the working
    class, should serve as elements uniting millions upon millions of
    working people in Russia and all over the world.
If we give some thought to what, after all, was the underlying
    reason for this historical miracle, why a weak, exhausted and
    backward country was able to defeat the most powerful countries in
    the world, we shall find that it was centralisation, discipline
    and unparalleled self-sacrifice. On what basis? Millions of
    working people in a country that was anything but educated could
    achieve this organisation, discipline and centralisation only
    because the workers had passed through the school of capitalism
    and had been united by capitalism, because the proletariat in all
    the advanced countries has united—and united the more, the
    more advanced the country; and on the other hand, because
    property, capitalist property, small property under commodity
    production, disunites. Property disunites, whereas we are uniting,
    and increasingly uniting, millions of working people all over the
    world. This is now clear even to the blind, one might say, or at
    least to those who will not see. Our enemies grew more and more
    disunited as time went on. They were disunited by capitalist
    property, by private property under commodity production, whether
    they were small proprietors who profiteered by selling surplus
    grain at exorbitant prices and enriched themselves at the expense
    of the starving workers, or the capitalists of the various
    countries, even though they possessed military might and were
    creating a League of Nations, a “great united league”
    of all the foremost nations of the world. Unity of this kind is a
    sheer fiction, a sheer fraud, a sheer lie. And we have
    seen—and this was a great example—that this notorious
    League of Nations, which attempted to hand out mandates for the
    government of states, to divide up the world—that this
    notorious alliance proved to be a soap-bubble which at once burst,
    because it was an alliance founded on capitalist property. We have
    seen this on a vast historical scale, and it confirms that
    fundamental truth which told us that our cause was just, that the
    victory of the October Revolution was absolutely certain, and that
    the cause we were embarking on was one to which, despite all
    difficulties and obstacles, millions and millions of working
    people in all countries would rally. We knew that we had allies,
    that it was only necessary for the one country to which history
    had presented this honourable and most difficult task to display a
    spirit of self-sacrifice, for these incredible sacrifices to be
    repaid a hundredfold—every month we held out in our country
    would win us millions and millions of allies in all countries of
    the world.
If, after all, we give some thought to the reason we were able
    to win, were bound to win, we shall find that it was only because
    all our enemies—who were formally tied by all sorts of bonds
    to the most powerful governments and capitalists in the
    world—however united they may have been formally, actually
    turned out to be disunited. Their internal bond in fact disunited
    them, pitted them against each other. Capitalist property
    disintegrated them, transformed them from allies into savage
    beasts, so that they failed to see that Soviet Russia was
    increasing the number of her followers among the British soldiers
    who had been landed in Archangel, among the French sailors in
    Sevastopol, among the workers of all countries, of all the
    advanced countries without exception, where the
    social-compromisers took the side of capital. In the final
    analysis this was the fundamental reason, the underlying reason,
    that made our victory certain and which is still the chief,
    insuperable and inexhaustible source of our strength; and it
    permits us to affirm that when we in our country achieve the
    dictatorship of the proletariat in full measure, and the maximum
    unity of its forces, through its vanguard, its advanced party, we
    may expect the world revolution. And this in fact is an expression
    of will, an expression of the proletarian determination to fight;
    it is an expression of the proletarian determination to achieve an
    alliance of millions upon millions of workers of all
    countries.
The bourgeoisie and the pseudo-socialist gentry of the Second
    International have declared this to be mere propagandist talk. But
    it is not, it is historical reality, borne out by the bloody and
    painful experience of the Civil War in Russia. For this Civil War
    was a war against world capital; and world capital disintegrated
    of itself, devoured itself, amidst strife, whereas we, in a
    country where the proletariat was perishing from hunger and
    typhus, emerged more hardened and stronger than ever. In this
    country we won the support of increasing numbers of working
    people. What the compromisers formerly regarded as propagandist
    talk and the bourgeoisie were accustomed to sneer at, has been
    transformed in these years of our revolution, and particularly in
    the year under review, into an absolute and indisputable
    historical fact, which enables us to say with the most positive
    conviction that our having accomplished this is evidence that we
    possess a world-wide basis, immeasurably wider than was the case
    in any previous revolution. We have an international alliance, an
    alliance which has nowhere been registered, which has never been
    given formal embodiment, which from the point of view of
    “constitutional law” means nothing, but which, in the
    disintegrating capitalist world, actually means everything. Every
    month that we gained positions, or merely held out against an
    incredibly powerful enemy, proved to the whole world that we were
    right and brought us millions of new supporters. 

    

      This process has been a difficult one; it has been accompanied
      by tremendous defeats. In this very year under review the
      monstrous White terror in Finland[2] was followed by the
      defeat of the Hungarian revolution, which was stifled by the
      governments of the Entente countries that deceived their
      parliaments and concluded a secret treaty with Rumania.
It was the vilest piece of treachery, this conspiracy of the
    international Entente to crush the Hungarian revolution by means
    of a White terror, not to mention the fact that in order to
    strangle the German revolution they were ready for any
    understanding with the German compromisers,[3] and that
    these people, who had declared Liebknecht to be an honest German,
    pounced on this honest German like mad dogs together with the
    German imperialists. They exceeded all conceivable bounds; but
    every such act of suppression on their part only strengthened and
    consolidated us, while it undermined them.
And it seems to me that we must first and foremost draw a
    lesson from this fundamental experience. Here we must make a
    special point of basing our agitation and propaganda on an
    analysis, an explanation of why we were victorious, why the
    sacrifices made in the Civil War have been repaid a hundredfold,
    and how we must act, on the basis of this experience, in order to
    succeed in another war, a war on a bloodless front, a war which
    has only changed its form, but which is being waged against us by
    those same representatives, lackeys and leaders of the old
    capitalist world, only still more vigorously, still more
    furiously, still more zealously. More than any other, our
    revolution has proved the rule that the strength of a revolution,
    the vigour of its assault, its energy, determination, its victory
    and its triumph intensify the resistance of the bourgeoisie. The
    more victorious we are the more the capitalist exploiters learn to
    unite and the more determined their onslaught. For, as you all
    distinctly remember—it was not so long ago when judged by
    the passage of time, but a long time ago when judged by the march
    of events—at the beginning of the October Revolution
    Bolshevism was regarded as a freak; this view, which was a
    reflection of the feeble development and weakness of the
    proletarian revolution, very soon had to be abandoned in Russia
    and has now been abandoned in Europe as well. Bolshevism has
    become a world-wide phenomenon, the workers’ revolution has
    raised its head. The Soviet system, in creating which in October
    we followed the traditions of 1905, developing our own
    experience—this Soviet system has become a phenomenon of
    world-historic importance.
Two camps are now quite consciously facing each other all over
    the world; this may be said without the slightest exaggeration. It
    should be noted that only this year have they become locked in a
    decisive and final struggle. And now, at the time of this very
    Congress, we are passing through what is perhaps one of the
    greatest, most acute but not yet completed periods of transition
    from war to peace.
You all know what happened to the leaders of the imperialist
    powers of the Entente who loudly announced to the whole world:
    “We shall never stop fighting those usurpers, those bandits,
    those arrogators of power, those enemies of democracy, those
    Bolsheviks”—you know that first they lifted the
    blockade, that their attempt to unite the small states failed,
    because we succeeded in winning over not only the workers of all
    countries, but also the bourgeoisie of the small countries, for
    the imperialists oppress not only the workers of their own
    countries but the bourgeoisie of the small states as well. You
    know that we won over the vacil- lating bourgeoisie in the
    advanced countries. And the present position is that the Entente
    is breaking its former promises and assurances and is violating
    the treaties which, incidentally, it concluded dozens of times
    with various Russian whiteguards. And now, as far as these
    treaties are concerned, the Entente is the loser, for it
    squandered hundreds of millions on them but failed to complete the
    job.
It has now lifted the blockade and has virtually begun peace
    negotiations with the Soviet Republic. But it is not completing
    these negotiations, and therefore the small states have lost faith
    in it and in its might. So we see that the position of the
    Entente, its position in foreign affairs, defies all definition
    from the standpoint of the customary concepts of law. The states
    of the Entente are neither at peace with the Bolsheviks nor at war
    with them; they have recognised us and they have not recognised
    us. And this utter confusion among our opponents, who were so
    convinced that they represented something, proves that they
    represent nothing but a pack of capitalist beasts who have fallen
    out among themselves and are absolutely incapable of doing us any
    harm. 

    

      The position today is that Latvia has officially made peace
      proposals[4] to us. Finland has sent a telegram
      which officially speaks of a demarcation line but actually
      implies a swing to a policy of peace.[5] Lastly, Poland, the
      Poland whose representatives have been, and still are,
      sabre-rattling so vigorously, the Poland that has been, and
      still is, receiving so many trainloads of artillery and promises
      of help in everything, if only she would continue the war with
      Russia—even Poland, the unstable position of whose
      government compels her to consent to any military gamble, has
      invited us to begin negotiations for peace.[6] We
      must be extremely cautious. Our policy demands the most careful
      thought. Here it is hardest of all to find the proper policy,
      for nobody as yet knows on what track the train is standing; the
      enemy himself does not know what he is going to do next. The
      gentlemen who represent French policy and who are most zealous
      in egging Poland on, and the leaders of landowner and bourgeois
      Poland do not know what will happen next; they do not know what
      they want. Today they say, “Gentlemen, let us have a few
      trainloads of guns and a few hundred millions and we are
      prepared to fight the Bolsheviks.” They are hushing up the
      news of the strikes that are spreading in Poland; they are
      tightening up the censorship so as to conceal the truth. But the
      revolutionary movement in Poland is growing. The spread of
      revolution in Germany, in its new phase, in its new stage, now
      that the workers, after the German Kornilov-type putsch, are
      creating Red Armies, plainly shows (as can be seen from the
      recent dispatches from Germany) that the temper of the workers
      is rising more and more. The Polish bourgeoisie and landowners
      are themselves beginning to wonder whether it is not too late,
      whether there will not be a Soviet Republic in Poland before the
      government acts either for war or for peace. They do not know
      what to do. They do not know what the morrow will bring.
But we know that our forces are growing vastly every month, and
    will grow even more in future. The result is that our
    international position is now more stable than ever. But we must
    watch the international crisis with extreme care and be prepared
    for any eventuality. We have received a formal offer of peace from
    Poland. These gentlemen are in desperate straits, so desperate
    that their friends, the German monarchists, people with better
    training and more political experience and knowledge, plunged into
    a venturous gamble, a Kornilov-type putsch. The Polish bourgeoisie
    are throwing out offers of peace because they know that any
    venturous gamble may prove to be a Polish Kornilov-type
    affair. Knowing that our enemy is in desperate straits, that our
    enemy does not know what he wants to do or what he will do
    tomorrow, we must tell ourselves quite definitely that in spite of
    the peace overtures war is possible. It is impossible to foretell
    what their future conduct will be. We have seen these people
    before, we know these Kerenskys, these Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries. During the past two years we have seen
    them one day drawn towards Kolchak, the next day almost towards
    the Bolsheviks, and then towards Denikin—and all this
    camouflaged by talk about freedom and democracy. We know these
    gentlemen, and therefore we grasp at the proposal of peace with
    both hands and are prepared to make the maximum concessions, in
    the conviction that the conclusion of peace with the small states
    will further our cause infinitely more than war. For the
    imperialists used war to deceive the working masses, they used it
    to conceal the truth about Soviet Russia. Any peace, therefore,
    will open channels for our influence a hundred times wider, which,
    as it is, has grow n considerably in these past few years. The
    Third, Communist International has achieved unparalleled
    successes. But at the same time we know that war may be forced
    upon us any day. Our enemies do not themselves know as yet what
    they are capable of doing in this respect.
That war preparations are under way, of that there is not the
    slightest doubt. Many of the states bordering on Russia—and
    perhaps many of those not bordering on Russia—are now
    arming. That is why we must manoeuvre so flexibly in our
    international policy and adhere so firmly to the course we have
    taken, that is why we must be prepared for anything. We have waged
    the war for peace with extreme vigour. This war is yielding
    splendid results. We have made a very good showing in this sphere
    of the struggle, at any rate, not inferior to the showing made by
    the Red Army on the front where blood is being shed. But the
    conclusion of peace with us does not depend on the will of the
    small states even if they desire it. They are up to their ears in
    debt to the countries of the Entente, who are wrangling and
    competing desperately among themselves. We must therefore remember
    that peace is of course possible from the point of view of the
    world situation, the historical situation created by the Civil War
    and by the war against the Entente.
But the measures we take for peace must be accompanied by
    intensified preparedness for defence, and in no case must our army
    be disarmed. Our army offers a real guarantee that the imperialist
    powers will not make the slightest attempt or encroachment on us;
    for although they might count on certain ephemeral successes at
    first, not one of them would escape defeat at the hands of Soviet
    Russia. That we must realise, that must be made the basis of our
    agitation and propaganda, that is what we must prepare for, in
    order to solve the problem which, in view of our growing fatigue,
    compels us to combine the one with the other.
I now pass to those important considerations of principle which
    induced us to direct the working masses so resolutely along the
    lines of using the army for the solution of certain basic and
    immediate problems. The old source of discipline, capital, has
    been weakened, the old source of unity has disappeared. We must
    create a different kind of discipline, a different source of
    discipline and unity. Coercion evokes the indignation, the howls,
    the yells and outcries of the bourgeois democrats, who make great
    play of the words “freedom” and
    “equality”, but do not understand that freedom for
    capital is a crime against the working people, that equality
    between the rich and the destitute is a crime against the working
    people. In our fight against falsehood, we introduced labour
    conscription and proceeded to unite the working people, not
    hesitating to use coercion. For no revolution has ever been
    effected without coercion, and the proletariat has a right to
    exercise coercion in order to hold its own at all costs. When
    those gentry, the bourgeois, the compromisers, the German
    Independents, the Austrian Independents, and the French
    Longuetists, argued about the historical factor, they always
    forgot such a factor as the revolutionary determination, firmness
    and steadfastness of the proletariat. And that factor is precisely
    the steadfastness and firmness of the proletariat of our country,
    which declares, and has proved by its deeds, that we are prepared
    to perish to a man rather than yield our territory, rather than
    yield our principle, the principle of discipline and firm policy,
    for the sake of which everything else must be sacrificed. At the
    time when the capitalist countries and the capitalist class are
    disintegrating, at this moment of crisis and despair, this
    political factor is the only decisive one. Talk about minority and
    majority, about democracy and freedom decides nothing, however
    much the heroes of a past historical period may invoke them. It is
    the class-consciousness and firmness of the working class that
    count here. If the working class is prepared to make sacrifices,
    if it shows that it is able to strain every nerve, the problem
    will be solved. Everything must be directed to the solution of
    this problem. The determination of the working class, its
    inflexible adherence to the watchword “Death rather than
    surrender!” is not only a historical factor, it is the
    decisive, the winning factor.
We are now going over from this victory and this conviction to
    problems of peaceful economic development, the solution of which
    is the chief function of our Congress. In this respect we cannot,
    in my opinion, speak of a report of the Political Bureau of the
    Central Committee, or, rather, of a political report of the
    Central Committee. We must say frankly and bluntly that this,
    comrades, is a question which you must decide, which you must
    weigh with all your authority as the supreme Party body. We have
    laid the question before you quite clearly. We have taken up a
    definite stand. It is your duty finally to endorse, correct or
    amend our decision. But in its report the Central Committee must
    say that on this fundamental and urgent question it has adopted an
    absolutely definite stand. Yes, the thing now is to apply to the
    peaceful work of economic development, to the restoration of our
    shattered industry, everything that can weld the proletariat into
    an absolute unity. Here we need the iron discipline, the iron
    system, without which we could not have held on for two months,
    let alone over two years. We must be able to utilise our
    success. On the other hand, it must be realised that this
    transition will demand many sacrifices, of which the country has
    already made so many.
On the principle involved the Central Committee was quite
    clear. Our activities were entirely governed by this policy and
    conducted in this spirit. Take, for example, the question of
    corporate management versus individual management, which you will
    have to settle—a question which may appear to be a
    subsidiary one, and which in itself, if torn from its context,
    cannot of course claim to be a fundamental question of
    principle. This question should be examined only from the point of
    view of our basic knowledge, experience and revolutionary
    practice. For instance, we are told that “corporate
    management is one of the forms in which the masses participate in
    the work of administration”. But we on the Central Committee
    discussed this question and took our decision, which we have to
    report to you—comrades, such theoretical confusion cannot be
    tolerated. Had we permitted a tenth part of this theoretical
    confusion in the fundamental question of our military activities,
    of our Civil War, we would have been beaten, and would have
    deserved to be beaten.
Permit me, comrades, in connection with the report of the
    Central Committee and with this question of whether the new class
    should participate in the work of administration on a corporate or
    an individual basis, to introduce a little bit of theory, to point
    out how a class governs and what class domination actually
    is. After all, we are not novices in these matters, and what
    distinguishes our revolution from former revolutions is that there
    is nothing utopian about it. The new class, having replaced the
    old class, can maintain itself only by a desperate struggle
    against other classes; and it will finally triumph only if it can
    bring about the abolition of classes in general. That is what the
    vast and complex process of the class struggle demands; otherwise
    you will sink into a morass of confusion. What is class
    domination? In what way did the bourgeoisie dominate over the
    feudal lords? The Constitution spoke of freedom and equality. That
    was a lie. As long as there are working men, property-owners are
    in a position to profiteer, and indeed, as property-owners, are
    compelled to profiteer. We declare that there is no equality, that
    the well-fed man is not the equal of the hungry man, that the
    profiteer is not the equal of the working man.
How is class domination expressed today? The domination of the
    proletariat consists in the fact that the landowners and
    capitalists have been deprived of their property. The spirit and
    basic idea of all previous constitutions, even the most republican
    and democratic, amounted to one thing—property. Our
    Constitution has the right, has won itself the right, to a place
    in history by virtue of the fact that the abolition of property is
    not confined to a paper declaration. The victorious proletariat
    has abolished property, has completely annulled it—and
    therein lies its domination as a class. The prime thing is the
    question of property. As soon as the question of property was
    settled practically, the domination of the class was
    assured. When, after that, the Constitution recorded on paper what
    had been actually effected, namely, the abolition of capitalist
    and landed property, and added that under the Constitution the
    working class enjoys more rights than the peasantry, while
    exploiters have no rights whatever—that was a record of the
    fact that we had established the domination of our class, thereby
    binding to ourselves all sections and all small groups of working
    people.
 The petty-bourgeois property-owners are disunited; those who
    have more property are the enemies of those who have less
    property; and the proletarians, by abolishing property, have
    declared open war on them. There are still many unenlightened and
    ignorant people who are wholly in favour of any kind of freedom of
    trade, but who cannot fight when they see the discipline and
    self-sacrifice displayed in securing victory over the exploiters;
    they are not with us, but are powerless to come out against us. It
    is only the domination of a class that determines property
    relations and which class is to be on top. Those who, as we so
    frequently observe, associate the question of the nature of class
    domination with the question of democratic centralism create such
    confusion that all successful work on this basis becomes
    impossible. Clarity in propaganda and agitation is a fundamental
    condition. When our enemies said and admitted that we had
    performed miracles in developing agitation and propaganda, that
    was not to be understood in the superficial sense that we had
    large numbers of agitators and used up large quantities of paper,
    but in the intrinsic sense that the truth contained in that
    propaganda penetrated to the minds of all; there is no escaping
    from that truth.
Whenever classes displaced each other, they changed property
    relations. When the bourgeoisie superseded the feudals, it changed
    property relations; the Constitution of the bourgeoisie says:
    “The man of property is the equal of the beggar.” That
    was bourgeois freedom. This kind of “equality” ensured
    the domination of the capitalist class in the state. But do you
    think that when the bourgeoisie superseded the feudals they
    confused the state with the administration? No, they were no such
    fools. They declared that the work of administration required
    people who knew how to administer, and that they would adapt
    feudal administrators for that purpose. And that is what they
    did. Was it a mistake? No, comrades, the art of administration
    does not descend from heaven, it is not inspired by the Holy
    Ghost. And the fact that a class is the leading class does not
    make it at once capable of administering. We have an example of
    this: while the bourgeoisie were establishing their victory they
    took for the work of administration members of another class, the
    feudal class; there was nowhere else to get them from. We must be
    sober and face the facts. The bourgeoisie had recourse to the old
    class; and we, too, are now confronted with the task of taking the
    knowledge and training of the old class, subordinating it to our
    needs, and using it all for the success of our class. We,
    therefore, say that the victorious class must be mature, and
    maturity is attested not by a document or certificate, but by
    experience and practice.
When the bourgeoisie triumphed, they did not know how to
    administer; and they made sure of their victory by proclaiming a
    new constitution and by recruiting, enlisting administrators from
    their own class and training them, utilising for this purpose
    administrators of the old class. They began to train their own new
    administrators, fitting them for the work with the help of the
    whole machinery of state; they sequestrated the feudal
    institutions and admitted only the wealthy to the schools; and in
    this way, in the course of many years and decades, they trained
    administrators from their own class. Today, in a state which is
    constructed on the pattern and in the image of the dominant class,
    we must act as every state has acted. If we do not want to be
    guilty of sheer utopianism and meaningless phrase-mongering, we
    must say that we must take into account the experience of the
    past; that we must safeguard the Constitution won by the
    revolution, but that for the work of administration, of organising
    the state, we need people who are versed in the art of
    administration, who have state and business experience, and that
    there is nowhere we can turn to for such people except the old
    class.
Opinions on corporate management are all too frequently imbued
    with a spirit of sheer ignorance, a spirit of opposition to the
    specialists. We shall never succeed with such a spirit. In order
    to succeed we must understand the history of the old bourgeois
    world in all its profundity; and in order to build communism we
    must take technology and science and make them available to wider
    circles. And we can take them only from the
    bourgeoisie—there is nowhere else to get them
    from. Prominence must be given to this fundamental question, it
    must be treated as one of the basic problems of economic
    development. We have to administer with the help of people
    belonging to the class we have overthrown; they are imbued with
    the prejudices of their class and we must re-educate them. At the
    same time we must recruit our own administrators from our own
    class. We must use the entire machinery of state to put the
    schools, adult education, and all practical training at the
    service of the proletarians, the factory workers and the labouring
    peasants, under the guidance of the Communists.
That is the only way to get things going. After our two
    years’ experience we cannot argue as though we were only
    just setting about the work of socialist construction. We
    committed follies enough in and around the Smolny period. That is
    nothing to be ashamed of. How were we to know, seeing that we were
    undertaking something absolutely new? We first tried one way, then
    another. We swam with the current, because it was impossible to
    distinguish the right from the wrong; that requires time. Now that
    is all a matter of the recent past, which we have got beyond. That
    past, in which chaos and enthusiasm prevailed, is now over. One
    document from that past is the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It is a
    historic document—more, it was a period of history. The
    Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was forced upon us because we were
    helpless in every way. What sort of period was it? It was a period
    of impotence, from which we emerged victorious. It was a period in
    which corporate management was universal. You cannot escape that
    historical fact by declaring that corporate management is a school
    of administration. You cannot stay for ever in the preparatory
    class of a school! (Applause.) That will not do. We are
    grown-up now, and we shall be beaten and beaten again in every
    field if we behave like schoolboys. We must push forward. We must
    push higher with energy and unanimity of will. Tremendous
    difficulties face the trade unions. We must get them to regard
    this task in the spirit of the fight against the survivals of the
    celebrated democracy. All these outcries against appointees, all
    this old and dangerous rubbish which finds its way into various
    resolutions and conversations must be swept away. Otherwise we
    cannot succeed. If we have failed to master this lesson in these
    two years, we are lagging, and those who lag, get beaten.
The task is an extremely difficult one. Our trade unions have
    been of tremendous assistance in building the proletarian
    state. They were a link between the Party and the unenlightened
    millions. Let us not close our eyes to the fact that the trade
    unions bore the brunt of the struggle against all our troubles
    when the state needed help in food work. Was this not a tremendous
    task? The recent issue of the Bulletin of the Central
    Statistical Board contains summaries by statisticians who
    certainly cannot be suspected of Bolshevism. Two interesting
    figures are given: in 1918 and 1919 the workers in the consuming
    gubernias received seven poods a year, while the
    peasants in the producing gubernias consumed seventeen
    poods a year. Before the war they used to consume sixteen
    poods a year. There you have two figures illustrating the
    relation of classes in the struggle for food. The proletariat
    continued to make sacrifices. People shout about coercion! But the
    proletariat justified and legitimatised coercion; it justified it
    by making the greatest sacrifices. The majority of the population,
    the peasants of the producing gubernias of our starving
    and impoverished Russia, for the first time had more food than
    throughout the centuries of tsarist and capitalist Russia. And we
    say that the masses will go on starving until the Red Army is
    victorious. The vanguard of the working class had to make this
    sacrifice. This struggle is a school; but when we leave this
    school we must go forward. This step must now be taken at all
    costs. Like all trade unions, the old trade unions have a history
    and a past. In the past they were organs of resistance to those
    who oppressed labour, to capitalism. But now that their class has
    become the governing class, and is being called upon to make great
    sacrifices, to starve and to perish, the situation has
    changed.
Not everybody understands this change, not everybody grasps its
    significance. And certain Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries
    who are demanding that corporate management be substituted for
    individual management have helped us in this matter. No, comrades,
    that won’t work. We have got beyond that. We are now faced
    with a very difficult task; having gained victory on the bloody
    front, we must now gain victory on the bloodless front. This war
    is a more difficult one. This front is the most arduous. We say
    this frankly to all class-conscious workers. The war which we have
    withstood at the front must be followed by a bloodless war. The
    fact is that the more we were victorious, the more regions we
    secured like Siberia, the Ukraine and the Kuban. In those regions
    there are rich peasants; there are no proletarians, and what
    proletariat there is, has been corrupted by petty-bourgeois
    habits. We know that everybody who has a piece of land in those
    parts says: “A fig for the government, I’ll get all I
    can out of the starving. A fat lot I care for the
    government.” The peasant profiteer who, when left to the
    tender mercies of Denikin, was swinging towards us will now be
    aided by the Entente. The war has changed its front and its
    forms. It is now taking the form of trade, of food profiteering,
    which it has made international. In Comrade Kamenev’s theses
    published in the Bulletin of the C.C.,
    R.C.P.(B.) the underlying principles are stated
    fully. They want to make food profiteering international. They
    want to turn peaceful economic development into the peaceful
    disintegration of Soviet power. No you don’t, my imperialist
    gentlemen! We are on our guard. We declare: we have fought and
    won, and we shall therefore retain as our basic slogan the one
    which helped us to victory; we shall fully preserve that slogan
    and apply it to the field of labour. That slogan is the firmness
    and unity of will of the proletariat. The old prejudices, the old
    habits that still remain, must be discarded.
I should like in conclusion, to dwell on Comrade Gusev’s
    pamphlet,
  [7] 
      which in my opinion deserves attention for two reasons. It is a
    good pamphlet not only from the formal standpoint, not only
    because it has been written for our Congress. Somehow, up to now
    we have all been accustomed to writing resolutions. They say that
    all literature is good except tedious literature. Resolutions, I
    take it, should he classed as tedious literature. It would be
    better if we followed Comrade Gusev’s example and wrote
    fewer resolutions and more pamphlets, even though they bristled
    with errors as his does. The pamphlet is good in spite of these
    errors, because it centres attention on a fundamental economic
    plan for the restoration of industry and production throughout the
    country, and because it subordinates everything to this
    fundamental economic plan. The Central Committee has introduced
    into the theses distributed today a whole paragraph taken entirely
    from Comrade Gusev’s theses. This fundamental economic plan
    can be worked out in greater detail with the help of experts. We
    must remember that the plan is designed for many years to come. We
    do not promise to deliver the country from hunger all at once. We
    say that the struggle will be much harder than the one on the war
    front. But it is a struggle that interests us more; it brings us
    nearer to our immediate and main tasks. It demands that maximum
    exertion of effort and that unity of will which we have displayed
    before and must display now. If we accomplish this, we shall gain
    no less a victory on the bloodless front than on the front of
    civil war. (Applause.)

Reply To The Discussion On The Report Of The Central
      Committee
March 30
Comrades, the part of the political report of the Central
    Committee which evoked chief attack was the one Comrade Sapronov
    called vituperation. Comrade Sapronov lent a very definite
    character and flavour to the position he defended; and in order to
    show you how matters actually stand, I would like to begin by
    reminding you of certain basic dates. Here I have before me
    Bulletin of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) for March 2 in
    which we printed a letter from the Central Committee to
    R.C.P. organisations on the subject of the organisation of the
    Congress. And in this first letter we said: “Happily, the
    time for purely theoretical discussions, disputes over general
    questions and the adoption of resolutions on principles has
    passed. That stage is over; it was dealt with and settled
    yesterday and the day before yesterday. We must march ahead, and
    we must realise that we are now confronted by a practical
    task, the business task of rapidly overcoming
    economic chaos, and we must do it with all our strength, with
    truly revolutionary energy, and with the same devotion with which
    our finest worker and peasant comrades, the Red Army men, defeated
    Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin.”
I must confess that I was guilty of optimism in thinking that
    the time of theoretical discussions had passed. We had theorised
    for fifteen years before the revolution, we had been administering
    the state for two years, and it was about time we displayed
    practical, business-like efficiency; and so, on March 2 we
    appealed to comrades with practical experience. In reply,
    Tomsky’s theses were published in Ekonomicheskaya
    Zhizn on March 10, the theses of Comrades Sapronov, Osinsky
    and Maximovsky on March 23, and on March 27 the theses of the
    Moscow Gubernia Committee appeared—that is, all after our
    appeal to the Party. And in all the theses the question was
    treated wrongly from the theoretical standpoint. The view we
    expressed in the letter was optimistic, mistaken; it had seemed to
    us that this period had already passed, but the theses showed that
    it had not yet passed, and the comrades from the trade unions have
    no right to complain of having been treated unfairly. The question
    now is, which is right—our view, or the position advocated
    after our appeal of March 2 by all these theses? All of them
    contain a lot of practical material to which attention must be
    given. If the Central Committee did not give it serious attention,
    it would be an absolutely worthless institution. 
But listen to what Comrade Tomsky says:
 
      “§7. The basic structural principle of the regulation
      and management of industry, the only one that can ensure the
      participation of broad masses of non-party workers through the
      trade unions, is the existing principle of corporate management
      of industry, from the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council
      down to the factory managements. Only in special cases, and by
      mutual agreement between the Presidiums of the Supreme Economic
      Council and the All-Russia Central Trade Union Council, or the
      Central Committees of the trade unions concerned, should one-man
      management be permitted in certain enterprises, but only on the
      obligatory condition that control be exercised over the
      administrators by the trade unions and their bodies.
 “§8. To ensure a single plan of
    economic development and co-ordination of the activities of the
    trade unions and the economic bodies, the participation of the
    trade unions in the management and regulation of industry should
    be based on the following principles: (a) general questions of
    economic policy shall be discussed by the Supreme Economic Council
    and its organs with the participation of the trade unions; (b) the
    directing economic collegiums shall be formed by the Supreme
    Economic Council and its organs in conjunction with the relevant
    trade union bodies; (c) the collegiums of economic bodies, while
    discussing general questions of the economic policy of any branch
    of production in conjunction with the trade unions and furnishing
    them with periodical reports on their activities, shall be
    regarded as organs of the Supreme Economic Council only, and shall
    be obliged to carry out the decisions only of that body, (d) all
    collegiums of economic bodies shall unreservedly carry out the
    decisions of the higher organs of the Supreme Economic Council,
    individually and corporately, and be accountable for their
    fulfilment only to the Supreme Economic Council.”
Here the most elementary theoretical questions are terribly
    muddled. 
It is true that management is the job of the individual
    administrator; but who exactly that administrator will be—an
    expert or a worker—will depend on how many administrators we
    have of the old and the new type. That is elementary theory. Well,
    then, let us talk about that. But if you want to discuss the
    political line of the Central Committee, do not attribute to us
    things we did not suggest and did not say. On March 2 we appealed
    to the comrades to give us practical support, and what did we get
    in reply? From the comrades in the localities we got in reply
    things that are obviously wrong from the theoretical
    standpoint. The theses of Comrades Osinsky, Maximovsky and
    Sapronov that appeared on March 23 contain nothing but theoretical
    blunders. They say that corporate management in one form or
    another is an indispensable basis of democracy. I assert that you
    will find nothing like it in the fifteen years’
    pre-revolutionary history of the Social-Democratic
    movement. Democratic centralism means only that representatives
    from the localities get together and elect a responsible body,
    which is to do the administering. But how? That depends on how
    many suitable people, how many good administrators are
    available. Democratic centralism means that the congress
    supervises the work of the Central Committee, and can remove it
    and appoint another in its place. But if we were to go into the
    theoretical errors contained in these theses, we should never be
    done. I personally will not deal with this any more, and will only
    say that the Central Committee adopted the only line that could be
    adopted on this question. I know very well that Comrade Osinsky,
    and the others do not share the views of Makhno and Makhaisky, but
    Makhno’s followers are bound to seize upon their
    arguments. They are connected with them. Take the theses of the
    Moscow Gubernia Committee of the Party that we have been given. It
    says there that in a developed socialist society, where there will
    be no social division of labour or fixed professions, the
    periodical replacement of people performing administrative
    functions in rotation will be possible only on the basis of a
    broad corporate principle, and so on and so forth. This is a sheer
    muddle! 
 We appealed to the experienced people in the localities to
    help us with their practical advice. Instead, we are told that the
    Central Committee ignores the localities. What does it ignore?
    Dissertations on socialist society? There is not a trace of
    anything practical or business-like here. Of course, we have some
    splendid workers, who are borrowing a lot from the intelligentsia;
    but sometimes they borrow the worst, not the best. Then something
    has to be done about it. But if in reply to an appeal of the
    Central Committee for practical advice you bring up questions of
    principle, we have to talk about those questions. We have to say
    that errors of principle must be combated. And the theses
    published since March 2 contain preposterous errors of
    principle.
That is what I affirm. Well, let us talk about that and argue
    it out. Don’t try to evade it! It is no use claiming that
    you are not theoreticians. Pardon me, Comrade Sapronov, your
    theses are the theses of a theoretician. You would see if they
    were put into practice that you would have to turn back and settle
    questions in an unbusiness-like manner. Anybody who tried to take
    the theses of Comrades Maximovsky, Sapronov and Tomsky as
    practical guidance, would be profoundly mistaken; they are
    fundamentally wrong. I consider that their idea of the attitude of
    the class to the structure of the state is fundamentally wrong and
    would drag us back. Naturally, it is backed by all the elements
    who are lagging behind and have not yet got beyond all this. And
    the authors of these theses are to be blamed not for deliberately
    advocating inefficiency, but for their theoretical mistake on the
    question the Central Committee asked them to discuss; a mistake
    which in a way provides a banner, a justification, for the worst
    elements. And why? From want of thought. Authentic documents prove
    this beyond all doubt.
I now pass to the accusation made by Comrade Yurenev in
    connection with Comrade Shlyapnikov. If the Central Committee had
    removed Comrade Shlyapnikov, as a representative of the
    opposition, just before the Congress, that certainly would have
    been infamous. When we had established that Comrade Shlyapnikov
    was leaving, we said in the Political Bureau that we were not
    giving him any instructions before his departure; and on the eve
    of his departure Comrade Shlyapnikov came to me and said that he
    was not going on the instructions of the Central Committee. And so
    Comrade Yurenev simply heard a rumour and is now spreading
    it. (Yurenev : “Shlyapnikov told me so
    himself. . . .”)
I do not know how he could have told you so himself, seeing
    that he came to me before he left and said that he was not going
    on the instructions of the Central Committee. Yes, of course, if
    the Central Committee had banished the opposition before the
    Congress that would have been an unpardonable thing. But, in
    general, when there is talk about banishing people, I say:
    “Well, then, just try to elect a Central Committee which
    could distribute forces properly without giving any cause for
    complaint.” How can forces be distributed so that everybody
    is satisfied? If forces are not distributed, how can you talk
    about centralism? And if there were distortions of principles, let
    us have instances. If you say that we banished representatives of
    the opposition, give us an instance, and we shall examine it, for
    there may have been mistakes. Perhaps Comrade Yurenev, who
    complained to the Political Bureau of having been wrongfully
    withdrawn from the Western Front—perhaps he was banished?
    The Political Bureau examined the matter and found it correct. And
    whatever Central Committee you elected, it would have to
    distribute its forces.
Further, as regards the division of business between the
    Organising Bureau and the Political Bureau. Comrade Maximovsky is
    more experienced in matters of organisation than I am, and he says
    that Lenin is mixing Organising Bureau and Political Bureau
    questions. Well, let us see. In our opinion, the Organising Bureau
    should distribute forces and the Political Bureau deal with
    policy. If such a division is wrong, how are the functions of
    these two bodies to be divided? Do you want us to write a
    constitution? It is difficult to draw a hard and fast line between
    the Political Bureau and the Organising Bureau, to delimit their
    functions precisely. Any question may become a political one, even
    the appointment of the superintendent of a building. If anyone has
    any other solution to suggest, please let us have it. Comrades
    Sapronov, Maximovsky and Yurenev, let us have your proposals; just
    try to divide, to delimit the Organising Bureau and the Political
    Bureau. As we have it, the protest of a single member of the
    Central Committee is enough for us to treat the question as a
    political one. Yet in all this time there has not been a single
    protest. Independence is not hampered in any way: any member of
    the Central Committee may declare a question to be a political
    one. And anybody who has any practical experience in organisation,
    even if he is not as competent as Comrade Maximovsky, even if he
    has worked in this field only six months, ought to have made a
    different sort of criticism from the one Comrade Maximovsky
    made. Let the critics make definite recommendations. We shall
    accept them, and advise the election of a new Central Committee,
    which will carry out these recommendations. But all we have had is
    abstract criticism and false assertions.
Let us suppose you keep the Organising Bureau away from
    political leadership. What, then, I ask, will political leadership
    amount to? Who does the leading, if not people? And how can you
    lead except by distributing forces? How can you compel a man to
    carry out instructions if he is incompetent? He is given certain
    instructions, his work is checked, and finally he is put on
    another job. What more must we do to bring this home to Comrades
    Maximovsky, Sapronov and Osinsky, who in their theses propose a
    theoretical amendment that was rejected long ago? What they are
    doing in practice is even worse, and they are making it quite
    clear that they have no material for serious criticism.
I heard one practical point in Comrade Sapronov’s speech
    and jumped at it. Comrade Sapronov said: “The Seventh
    Congress of Soviets gave a ruling, and we are violating it; the
    decree on requisitioning flax is an infringement of the decision
    of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee.” I cannot
    remember even a tenth of the decrees we pass. But I made inquiries
    in the Secretariat of the Council of People’s Commissars
    about the regulations governing flax procurements. The decree was
    passed on February 10. And what has happened? There is not a
    comrade, whether on the Political Bureau or on the All-Russia
    Central Executive Committee, who is opposed to independent
    initiative. We haveseen them all here on this platform. Comrades
    know that they can speak for themselves. Why did they not appeal
    against this decision? Let us have your complaints! There was no
    such complaint after February 10. After a long fight, we adopted
    this decision, which was proposed by Comrade Rykov and agreed to
    by Comrade Sereda and the People’s Commissariat of
    Food. “You have made a mistake!” we are told. Perhaps
    we have. Correct us. Submit this question to the Political
    Bureau. That will be a formal decision. Let us have the
    minutes. If they show that we have violated a decision of the
    Congress, we ought to be put on trial. Where is the charge? On the
    one hand, they reproach us on account of Shlyapnikov; on the
    other, they say that the flax business was a violation of a
    decision. Be good enough to bring facts to show that we violated
    the decision. But you do not bring any facts. All your words are
    mere words: initiative, appointments, and so on. Why then have
    centralism? Could we have held out for even two months if we had
    made no appointments during this period, during these two years
    when in various places we passed from complete exhaustion and
    disruption to victory again? Just because you are displeased with
    the recall of Comrade Shlyapnikov or Comrade Yurenev, you fling
    these words among the crowd, among the unenlightened
    masses. Comrade Lutovinov says that the question has not been
    settled. It will have to be settled. If two people’s
    commissars differ in their opinion of Ivan Ivanovich, and one says
    that a question of policy is involved, what is to be done? What
    method do you propose? Do you think that it is only in the
    Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee that
    tedious questions arise? Let me tell you that there is not a
    single institution where tedious questions do not arise, and we
    all have to deal with questions of Maria Ivanovna and Sidor
    Ivanovich. But you cannot say that no politics are involved here,
    for politics fill all minds. Comrade Lutovinov had—I do not
    know how to put it; I fear to offend Comrade Sapronov’s
    delicate ear and I shrink from using a polemical
    expression—but he said that Comrade Krestinsky threatened to
    bring about a split. A meeting of the Bureau was held on the
    subject. We have the minutes of the Bureau, and I would ask all
    the Congress delegates to take these minutes and read them. We
    came to the conclusion that Comrade Krestinsky was hot-headed and
    that you, Comrade Lutovinov and Comrade Tomsky, had raised a very
    malodorous scandal. Perhaps we were wrong—then correct our
    decision; but it is preposterous to say what you said, without
    having read the documents and without mentioning that there was a
    special meeting and that the matter was investigated in the
    presence of Tomsky and Lutovinov.
There are two other points I still have to deal with. First,
    the appointment of Comrades Bukharin and Radek. It is said that we
    sent them to the All-Russia Central Trade Union Council as
    political commissars, and the attempt is being made here to
    represent this as a violation of independence, as
    bureaucracy. Perhaps you know better theoreticians than Radek and
    Bukharin. Then by all means let us have them. Perhaps you know
    people better acquainted with the trade union movement. Let us
    have them. Do you mean to say that the Central Committee has no
    right to reinforce a trade union with people who have the best
    theoretical knowledge of the trade union movement, who are
    acquainted with the experience of the Germans, and who can
    counteract an incorrect line? A Central Committee which did not do
    that could not be a directing body. The more we are surrounded by
    peasants and Kuban Cossacks the more difficulties we have with the
    proletarian dictatorship. Therefore the line must be straightened
    out at all costs and made as hard as steel, and this is the line
    we recommend to the Party Congress.
Comrade Bubnov told us here that he has close connections with
    the Ukraine and thereby betrayed the true character of his
    objections. He said that the Central Committee is responsible for
    the growing strength of the Borotba Party. This is a very
    complex and important issue, and I think in this important issue,
    which demanded manoeuvring, and very complex manoeuvring at that,
    we emerged victorious. When we said in the Central Committee that
    the maximum concessions should be made to the Borotbists, we were
    laughed at and told that we were not following a straight
    line. But you can fight in a straight line when the enemy’s
    line is straight. But when the enemy moves in zigzags, and not in
    a straight line, we have to follow him and catch him at every
    turn. We promised the maximum concessions to the Borotbists, but
    on condition that they pursued a communist policy. In this way we
    showed that we are in no way intolerant. And that these
    concessions were made quite rightly is shown by the fact that all
    the best elements among the Borotbists have now joined our
    Party. We have carried out a re-registration of this party, and
    instead of a revolt of the Borotbists, which seemed inevitable, we
    find that, thanks to the correct policy of the Central Committee,
    which was carried out so splendidly by Comrade Rakovsky, all the
    best elements among the Borotbists have joined our Party under our
    control and with our recognition, while all the rest have
    disappeared from the political scene. This victory was worth a
    couple of good tussles. So anybody who says that the Central
    Committee is guilty of strengthening the Borotbists does not
    understand the political line on the national question.
I shall just touch on the speech of the last comrade, who said
    that everything in the programme about the trade unions should be
    deleted. There you have an example of hastiness. We don’t do
    things so simply. We say that nothing should be deleted, that the
    question should be discussed in pamphlets, articles in the press,
    and so on. The trade unions are heading for the time when they
    will take economic life, namely industry, into their hands. The
    talk about not admitting bourgeois specialists into the trade
    unions is a prejudice. The trade unions are educational bodies,
    and strict demands must be made on them. The Central Committee
    will not tolerate bad educators. Education is a long and difficult
    business. A decree is not enough here; patient and skilful
    handling is required. And that is what we are aiming at and will
    continue to aim at. It is a matter in which we must be cautious
    but firm.

Speech On Economic Development
March 31
Comrades, first two brief remarks. Comrade Sapronov continued
    to accuse me of forgetfulness, but the question he raised he left
    unexplained. He continued to assure us that the flax
    requisitioning decree is a violation of the decision of the
    All-Russia Central Executive Committee. I maintain that you cannot
    hurl unsupported accusations, very serious accusations, at a Party
    Congress in that way. Of course, if the Council of People’s
    Commissars has violated a decision of the All-Russia Central
    Executive Committee it should be put on trial. But how is it that
    from February 10 to this day no complaint has been received that
    this decree is a violation? All we get is an absolutely
    unsupported accusation of the sort that are handed out easily
    enough, but such methods of fighting are not to be taken
    seriously.
Comrade Milyutin says that there are practically no points of
    difference between us, and that therefore it looks as if Lenin
    opposes squabbling and himself provokes this squabble. But Comrade
    Milyutin is distorting things somewhat, which he ought not to
    do. The first draft of the resolution, compiled by Comrade
    Trotsky, was then edited corporately in the Central Committee. We
    sent this draft to Comrades Milyutin and Rykov. They returned it
    with the statement that they would give battle on it. This is what
    actually happened. After we had developed agitation and obtained
    allies, they organised an all-round opposition at the Congress;
    and it was only when they saw that nothing would come of it that
    they began to say they were almost in agreement. That is so, of
    course; but you must carry it through to the end and admit that
    your agreement means that you failed completely after the
    opposition came forward here and tried to consolidate itself on
    the issue of corporate management. Only after Comrade Milyutin had
    spoken for fifteen minutes, and his time was up, did it occur to
    him that it would be well to put the matter on a practical
    footing. He was quite right there. But I am afraid it is too late:
    although Comrade Rykov has still to close the discussion, the
    opposition cannot be saved. If the advocates of corporate
    management had during the past two months practised what they
    preached, if they had given us even a single example—not by
    saying there is a certain director and an assistant, but by an
    inquiry promoting a detailed investigation of the problem,
    comparing corporate management with individual management as was
    decided by the Congress of Economic Councils and by the Central
    Committee—we would have been much the wiser; at the Congress
    we would then have had something more than not very relevant
    discussions of principle, and the advocates of corporate
    management might have furthered matters. Their position would have
    been a strong one if they could have produced even ten factories
    with similar conditions managed on the corporate principle and
    compared them in a practical manner with the state of affairs in
    factories with similar conditions, but managed on the individual
    principle. We could have allowed any speaker an hour for such a
    report, and he would have furthered matters considerably. We might
    perhaps have established practical gradations in this question of
    corporate management. But the whole point is that none of them,
    neither the Economic Council members nor the trade unionists, who
    should have had practical data at their disposal, gave us
    anything, because they had nothing to give. They have nothing,
    absolutely nothing!
Comrade Rykov objected here that I want to remake the French
    Revolution, that I deny that the bourgeoisie grew up within the
    feudal system. That is not what I said. What I said was that when
    the bourgeoisie replaced the feudal system they took the feudal
    lords and learned from them how to administer; and this in no way
    contradicts the fact that the bourgeoisie grew up within the
    feudal system. And as for my thesis that, after it has seized
    power, the working class begins to put its principles into effect,
    nobody, absolutely nobody, has refuted it. After it has seized
    power, the working class maintains it, preserves it and
    consolidates it as every other class does, namely, by a change of
    property relations and by a new constitution. That is my first and
    fundamental thesis; and it is incontrovertible. My second thesis
    that every new class learns from its predecessor and takes over
    administrators from the old class, is also an absolute truth. And,
    lastly, my third thesis is that the working class must increase
    the number of administrators from its own ranks, establish
    schools, and train executives on a nation-wide scale. These three
    theses are indisputable, and they fundamentally contradict the
    theses of the trade unions.
 At the meeting of the group, when we examined their theses,
    and when Comrade Bukharin and I were defeated,[8] I told
    Comrade Tomsky that article 7 in the theses is the result of
    complete theoretical confusion. It says:
 
      “The basic structural principle of the regulation and
      management of industry, the only one that can ensure the
      participation of broad masses of non-party workers through the
      trade unions, is the existing principle of corporate management
      of industry, from the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council
      down to the factory managements. Only in special cases, and by
      mutual agreement between the Presidiums of the Supreme Economic
      Council and the All-Russia Central Trade Union Council, or the
      Central Committees of the trade unions concerned should one-man
      management be permitted in certain enterprises but only on the
      obligatory condition that control be exercised over the
      administrators by the trade unions and their bodies.”
This is sheer nonsense, because everything—the role of
    the working class in winning state power, the interrelation of
    methods—everything is muddled! Such things cannot be
    tolerated. Such things drag us back theoretically. The same must
    be said of the democratic centralism of Comrades Sapronov,
    Maximovsky and Osinsky. Comrade Osinsky forgets that when he comes
    forward and claims that I call democratic centralism nonsense. You
    cannot distort things in that way! What has the question of
    appointments, of endorsement by local organisations, got to do
    with it? You can have things endorsed by collegiums and you can
    also appoint collegiums. That has nothing to do with the
    case. They say that democratic centralism consists not only in the
    All-Russia Central Executive Committee ruling; but in the
    All-Russia Central Executive Committee ruling through the local
    organisations. What has corporate management or individual
    management got to do with it?
Comrade Trotsky recalled his report made in 1918 and, reading
    the speech he then made, pointed out that at that time not only
    did we argue about fundamental questions but a definite decision
    was taken by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. I dug up
    my old pamphlet The Immediate
    Tasks of the Soviet Government, which I had completely
    forgotten, and find that the question of individual management was
    not only raised but even approved in the theses of the All-Russia
    Central Executive Committee. We work in such a way that we forget
    not only what we ourselves have written but even what has been
    decided by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, and
    subsequently dig up these decisions. Here are some passages from
    this pamphlet.
“Those who deliberately (although most of
    them probably do not realise it) promote petty-bourgeois laxity
    would like to see in this granting of ‘unlimited’
    (i.e., dictatorial) powers to individuals a departure from the
    collegiate principle, from democracy and from the principles of
    Soviet government. Here and there, among Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, a positively hooligan agitation, i.e.,
    agitation appealing to the base instincts and to the small
    proprietor’s urge to ‘grab all he can’, has been
    developed against the dictatorship decree. . . .[9]
“Large-scale machine industry—which
    is precisely the material source, the productive source, the
    foundation of socialism—calls for absolute and strict
    unity of will, which directs the joint labours of
    hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands of people. The
    technical, economic and historical necessity of this is obvious,
    and all those who have thought about socialism have always
    regarded it as one of the conditions of socialism”
    . . . this is the only way in which “strict unity of will
    can be ensured. . . .
“But be that as it may, unquestioning
    subordination to a single will is absolutely necessary for
    the success of processes organised on the pattern of large-scale
    machine industry. On the railways it is twice and three times as
    necessary. . . .
 “And our whole task, the task of the
    Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which is the class-conscious vehicle
    of the strivings of the exploited for emancipation, is to
    appreciate this change, to understand that it is necessary, to
    stand at the head of the exhausted people who are wearily seeking
    a way out and lead them along the true path, along the path of
    labour discipline, along the path of co-ordinating the task of
    arguing at mass meetings about the conditions of work
    with the task of unquestioningly obeying the will of the Soviet
    leader, of the dictator, during the work. . . .
“It required precisely the October victory
    of the working people over the exploiters, it required a whole
    historical period in which the working people themselves could
    first of all discuss the new conditions of life and the new tasks,
    in order to make possible the durable transition to superior forms
    of labour discipline, to the conscious appreciation of the
    necessity for the dictatorship of the proletariat, to
    unquestioning obedience to the orders of individual
    representatives of the Soviet government during the
    work. . . .
“We must learn to combine the ‘public
    meeting’ democracy of the working people—turbulent,
    surging, overflowing its banks like a spring nood with
    iron discipline while at work, with unquestioning
    obedience to the will of a single person, the Soviet leader,
    while at work.”
On April 29, 1918, the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
    adopted a resolution fully endorsing the basic propositions set
    forth in this report and instructed its Presidium to recast them
    as theses representing the principal tasks of the Soviet
    government. We are thus reiterating what was approved two years
    ago in an official resolution of the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee! And we are now being dragged back on a matter that was
    decided long ago, a matter which the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee endorsed and explained, namely, that Soviet socialist
    democracy and individual management and dictatorship are in no way
    contradictory, and that the will of a class may sometimes be
    carried out by a dictator, who sometimes does more alone and is
    frequently more necessary. At any rate, the attitude towards the
    principles of corporate management and individual management was
    not only explained long ago, but was even endorsed by the
    All-Russia Central Executive Committee. In this connection our
    Congress is an illustration of the sad truth that instead of
    advancing from the explanation of questions of principle to
    concrete questions, we are advancing backward. Unless we get away
    from this mistake we shall never solve the economic problem.
I should also like to say a few words about certain remarks of
    Comrade Rykov’s. He asserts that the Council of
    People’s Commissars is putting obstacles in the way of the
    amalgamation of the commissariats running the economy. And when
    Comrade Rykov is told that he wants to swallow up Comrade
    Tsyurupa, he replies, “I don’t care if it is Tsyurupa
    that swallows me up, as long as the economic commissariats are
    amalgamated.” I know where this leads, and I must say that
    the attempt of the Supreme Economic Council to form a sort of
    separate bloc of the economic commissariats, separate from the
    Council of Defence and the Council of People’s Commissars,
    did not pass unnoticed by the Central Committee, and met with
    disfavour. The Council of Defence has now been renamed the Council
    of Labour and Defence. You want to separate yourselves from the
    Commissariat of the Army, which is giving its best forces to the
    war and is an institution without which you cannot even carry out
    labour conscription. And we cannot carry out labour conscription
    without the People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs
    either. Take the post office; we cannot send a letter without the
    Commissariat of Posts and Telegraphs. Take the People’s
    Commissariat of Health. How will you conduct the economy if
    seventy per cent are down with typhus? What it amounts to is that
    every matter must be co-ordinated and referred to an economic
    commissariat. Is not such a plan absolutely absurd? Comrade Rykov
    had no serious argument. That is why it was opposed and the
    Central Committee did not support it.
Further, Comrade Rykov joked about a bloc with Comrade
    Holtzmann, which Comrade Trotsky seems to be forming. I should
    like to say a few words on this. A bloc is always needed between
    Party groups that are in the right. That should always be regarded
    as an essential condition for a correct policy. If Comrade
    Holtzmann, whom, I regret to say, I know very little, but of whom
    I have heard as a representative of a certain trend among the
    metalworkers, a trend that particularly insists on sensible
    methods—which I stress in my theses, too—if it, is on
    these grounds that he insists on individual management, that, of
    course, can only be extremely useful. A bloc with this trend would
    be an exceedingly good thing. If the representation of the trade
    unions on the Central Committee is to be increased, it would be
    useful to have on it representatives of this trend
    too—though it may be wrong on certain points, it is at least
    original and has a definite shade of opinion of its own—side
    by side with the extremist champions of corporate management who
    are battling in the name of democracy but who are mistaken. Let
    them both be represented on the Central Committee—and you
    will have a bloc. Let the Central Committee be so constituted
    that, with the help of a bloc, a field of operation may be found
    that functions all the year round, and not only during the week a
    Party Congress is held. We have always rejected the principle of
    regional representation, because it leads to a lot of regional
    cliquism. When it is a question of closer fusion with the trade
    unions, of being alive to every shade of opinion in the trade
    unions, of maintaining contacts—it is essential for the
    Central Committee to be constituted in such a way as to have a
    transmission belt to the broad masses of the trade unions (we have
    600,000 Party members and 3,000,000 trade union members) to
    connect the Central Committee simultaneously with the united will
    of the 600,000 Party members and the 3,000,000 trade union
    members. We cannot govern without such a transmission belt. The
    more we won back of Siberia, the Kuban area and the Ukraine, with
    their peasant population, the more difficult the problem became,
    and the more laboriously the machine revolved, because in Siberia
    the proletariat is numerically small, and it is weaker in the
    Ukraine too. But we know that the Donets Basin and Nikolayev
    workers have bluntly refused to defend the semi-demagogic
    corporate principle into which Comrade Sapronov has lapsed. There
    can be no question but that the proletarian element in the Ukraine
    differs from the proletarian element in Petrograd, Moscow and
    Ivanovo Voznesensk—not because it is no good, but for purely
    historical reasons. They did not have occasion to become, so
    steeled by hunger, cold and strife as the proletarians of Moscow
    and Petrograd. We therefore need such a bond with the trade
    unions, such a form of organisation of the Central Committee, as
    would enable it to know every shade of opinion, not only among the
    600,000 Party members, but also among the 3,000,000 trade union
    members, so that it may be able at any moment to lead them all as
    one man! Such an organisation is essential. That is the basic
    factor, the political factor without which the dictatorship of the
    proletariat will not be a dictatorship. If we are to have a bloc,
    let it be a real bloc! We should not be afraid of it, but should
    welcome it and practise it more vigorously and more extensively
    right in the central institutions of the Party.

Speech On The Co-Operatives[10]
April 3
It was only last night and today that I have had an opportunity
    of partially acquainting myself with the two resolutions. I think
    that the resolution of the minority of the commission is the more
    correct. Comrade Milyutin attacked it with a great battery of
    terrifying words: he discovered half measures in it, even
    quarter-measures; he accused it of opportunism. But it seems to me
    that the devil is not as black as he is painted. If you get down
    to the root of the matter you will see that Comrade Milyutin, who
    tried to give the matter a basis in principle, showed by his own
    arguments that the resolution he advocated was incorrect and
    unsuitable specifically from the standpoint of practice and of
    Marxism. It is incorrect for the following reasons; Milyutin
    stated that his resolution, the resolution of the majority of the
    commission, advocated fusion with the volost executive committees,
    subordination to the volost executive committees, and that is why
    he sees in his resolution directness and decisiveness as compared
    with the insufficiently revolutionary character of the minority
    resolution. During the long course of our revolutionary campaign
    we have seen that whenever we made proper preparations for our
    revolutionary actions they were crowned with success; but that
    when they were merely imbued with revolutionary fervour they ended
    in failure.
What does the resolution of the minority of the commission say?
    The resolution of the minority says: direct your attention to
    intensifying communist work in the consumers’ societies and
    to securing a majority within them; first make ready the organs to
    which you want to hand them over, then you can hand them
    over. Compare this with the line pursued by Milyutin. He says: the
    co-operatives are no good, therefore hand them over to the volost
    executive committees. But have you a communist basis in the
    co-operatives you want to hand over? The essence of the
    matter—preparation—is ignored; only the ultimate
    slogan is given. If this communist work has been done, and organs
    have been set up to take them over and guide them, the transfer is
    quite natural, and there is no need to proclaim it at a Party
    congress. But have you not been threatening the peasants enough?
    Has not the Supreme Economic Council shaken its fist enough at the
    peasants and the co-operatives in the matter of the flax
    procurement? If you recall the practical experience of our work in
    the localities and in the Council of People’s Commissars,
    you will admit that this is a wrong attitude to take, and that the
    right resolution is the one which declares that the work of
    communist education and the training of executives are necessary,
    for otherwise the transfer will be impossible.
The second question of cardinal importance is that of contacts
    with the consumers’ co-operatives. Here Comrade Milyutin
    says something utterly inconsistent. If the consumers’
    co-operatives are not fulfilling all their assignments—which
    is what we have been saying for two years in a number of decrees
    directed against the kulaks—it must be remembered that
    government measures against the kulaks can also be applied against
    the co-operative societies. And this is being done in full. The
    most important thing at the moment is to increase production and
    the quantity of goods. If the consumers’ co-operatives do
    not get this done, they will be punished for it. But if, owing to
    their connection with the producers’ co-operatives, they
    give even a small increase of products, we must welcome it and
    foster the initiative. If the consumers’ co-operatives, in
    spite of their closer, intimate local connections with production,
    do not show an increase, it will mean that they have not fulfilled
    the direct assignment of the Soviet government. If there are even
    two or three energetic comrades in a district who are prepared to
    combat the kulaks and the bourgeoisie, victory is assured. In what
    way was Comrade Chuchin’s initiative thwarted? He did not
    cite a single instance. But the idea that we must link up the
    producers’ co-operatives with the consumers’
    cooperatives and agree to any concession that may increase the
    amount of products in the near future follows logically from our
    experience of the past two years. It in no way hampers either
    communist functionaries or Soviet officials in their war on the
    kulak co-operative, the bourgeois type of co-operative. Far from
    hampering them, it provides them with a new weapon. If you succeed
    in organising anything at all we shall give you a bonus; but if
    you do not fulfil this assignment we shall punish you, not only
    because you are counter-revolutionary-we have the Cheka for that,
    as was rightly pointed out here-no, we shall punish you for not
    fulfilling the assignment of the state, of the Soviet government
    and the proletariat.
Comrade Milyutin has not produced a single sound argument
    against amalgamating the consumers’ co-operativesall ho said
    was that this seemed to him to be opportunism or a
    half-measure. This is strange coming from Comrade Milyutin, who,
    with Comrade Rykov, was prepared to make big strides, hut
    discovered that lie cannot even make a tenth of one stride. From
    this aspect, connections with the consumers’ cooperatives
    will ho an advantage; they will make it possible to tackle
    production immediately. All means are available to prevent
    interference in political matters; and as to obedience in the
    production and economic sphere, that depends entirely on the
    People’s Commissariat of Agriculture and the Supreme
    Economic Council. These means are adequate for you to be able to
    control the co-operatives.
I now come to the third question, the question of
    nationalisation, which Milyu tin advocated in a way that was
    strange to hear. A commission was set up. Comrade K restinsky was
    in a minority on the commission and Comrade Mi. lyutin was the
    victor. But now he says: "On the question of nationalisation I am
    prepared not to argue." Then what was the commission arguing
    about? If your standpoint is the same as Comrade Chuchin’s
    you are wrong in renouncing nationalisation. It has been asked
    here why, if the capitalists have been nationalised, the kulaks
    cannot be nationalised too. It is not surprising that this
    argument evoked hilarity. For however you count the well-to-do
    peasants, those who exploit the labour of others, you will find
    there are no less than half a million, perhaps even something like
    a million. How do you propose to nationalise them? It is
    fantastic. We have not the means for that as yet.
Comrade Chuchin is quite right when he says that there are a
    lot of counter-revolutionaries in the co-operatives. But that is a
    horse of another colour. What was said about the Cheka was quite
    in place here. If you are too shortsighted to expose individual
    leaders of the co-operatives, then just install one Communist to
    detect the counter-revolution; if he is a good Communist—and
    a good Communist has the qualities of a good member of the
    Cheka—he should, when assigned to a consumers’
    society, bag at least two counter-revolutionary co-operators.
That is why Comrade Chuchin is wrong when he advocates
    immediate nationalisation. It would be a good thing, but it is
    impossible, for we are dealing with a class which is least
    susceptible to our influence and which certainly cannot be
    nationalised. We have not even nationalised all the industrial
    enterprises. By the time an order of the chief administrations and
    central boards reaches the localities it becomes absolutely
    ineffective; it is completely lost in a sea of documents, because
    of lack of roads and telegraph, etc. It is therefore impossible to
    speak of the nationalisation of the co-operatives as yet. Comrade
    Milyutin is wrong in principle too. He feels that his position is
    weak and thinks that he can simply withdraw this point. But in
    that case, Comrade Milyutin, you are undermining your own
    resolution, you are issuing a certificate to the effect that the
    resalution of the minority is right; for the spirit of your
    resolution—to subordinate them to the volost executive
    committees (that is exactly what is said ill the first
    clause—"take measures")is a Cheka spirit, wrongly introduced
    into an economic issue. The other resolution says that the first
    thing to do is to increase the number of Communists, to intensify
    communist propaganda and agitation-that a basis must be
    created. There is nothing grandiloquent here, no immediate
    promises of a land flowing with milk and honey. But if there are
    Communists in the localities, they will know what has to be done,
    and there will be no need for Comrade Chillchin to explain where
    counter-revolutionaries should be taken to. Secondly, an organ
    must be created. Create an
      organ and test it in action, check whether production is
    increasing-that is what the resolution of the minority says. First
    of all create a basis, and then-then we shall see. What has to be
    done will follow from this of itself. We have enough decrees
    saying that counter-revolutionaries should he handed over to the
    Choke, and if there is no Cheka, to the Revolutionary
    Committee. We need less of this fist-shaking. We must adopt the
    resolution of the minority, which lays down a basic line of
    policy.

Speech Closing The Congress
April 5
Comrades, in making a brief summary of the work of our Congress
    we must, in my opinion, first of all dwell upon the tasks of our
    Party. The Congress has adopted a detailed resolution on the
    question of organisation, and as might have been expected, a very
    important place in that resolution is occupied by the question of
    the education, the training, the organisational deployment of the
    members of our Party. The Credentials Committee has reported that
    over 600,000 members of our Party are represented at this
    Congress. We are all fully aware of the tremendous difficulties
    the Party has had to cope with in these strenuous times, when
    measures had to be taken to prevent the worst elements, the offal
    of the old capitalist system, from seeping into the government
    party, from fastening themselves on to it—it is naturally an
    open party, for it is the government party, and as such opens the
    way to power. One of these measures was the institution of Party
    Weeks. Under such conditions, at such moments, when the Party and
    the movement were in exceptionally trying situations, when Denikin
    stood north of Orel, and Yudenich within fifty versts of
    Petrograd, it was only people who were sincerely devoted to the
    cause of the emancipation of the working people who could have
    joined the Party.
Such conditions will not occur again, at least not in the near
    future, and it must be said that the huge membership (as compared
    with previous congresses) our Party has attained gives rise to a
    certain apprehension. And there is one very real danger, which is
    that the rapid growth of our Party has not always been
    commensurate with the extent to which we have educated this mass
    of people for the performance of the tasks of the moment. We must
    always bear in mind that this army of 600,000 must be the vanguard
    of the working class, and that we should scarcely have been able
    to carry out our tasks during these two years if it had not been
    for iron discipline. The basic condition for the maintenance and
    continuance of strict discipline is loyalty; all the old means and
    sources of discipline have ceased to exist, and we base our
    activities solely on a high degree of understanding and political
    consciousness. This has enabled us to achieve a discipline which
    is superior to that of any other state and which rests on a basis
    different from that of the discipline which is being maintained
    with difficulty, if it can be maintained at all, in capitalist
    society. We must therefore remember that our task in the coming
    year, after the brilliant successes achieved in the war, is not so
    much the growth of the Party as work inside the Party, the
    education of the membership of our Party. It is not for nothing
    that our resolutions on organisation devote as much space as
    possible to this question.
We must spare no effort to make this vanguard of the
    proletariat, this army of 600,000 members, capable of coping with
    the tasks that confront it. And it is confronted by tasks of
    gigantic international and internal importance. As to the
    international tasks, our international position has never been as
    good as it is now. News about the life of the workers abroad
    seldom reaches us, yet every time you receive a couple of letters
    or a few issues of European or American working-class socialist
    newspapers you experience real pleasure, because everywhere, in
    all parts of the world, you see among masses formerly entirely
    untouched by propaganda, or steeped in wretched opportunism, in
    purely parliamentary socialism, a tremendous growth of interest in
    the Soviet power, in the new tasks, a growth much greater than we
    imagine; everywhere you see intense revolutionary movement,
    ferment, and revolution has become a current issue.
I had occasion yesterday to glance through an issue of the
    newspaper of the British Socialist Labour Party. The British
    workers, whose leaders were intellectuals and who for decades were
    distinguished by their contempt for theory, are talking in quite
    definite tones; and the paper shows that the British workers are
    now taking an interest in the question of revolution, that there
    is a growing interest in the fight against revisionism,
    opportunism, and parliamentary socialism, the social-treachery we
    have got to know so well. This struggle is becoming an issue of
    the day. We can say quite definitely that our American Comrade R.,
    who has published a voluminous book containing a number of
    articles by Trotsky and myself, thus giving a summary of the
    history of the Russian revolution, was quite right when he said
    that the French Revolution was victorious on a world-wide scale,
    and that, if it was directly crushed, it was only because it was
    surrounded on the European continent by more backward countries,
    in which a movement of emulation, sympathy and support could not
    immediately arise. The Russian revolution, which, owing to the
    yoke of tsarism and a number of other factors (continuity with
    1905, etc.), started before the others, is surrounded by countries
    which are on a higher level of capitalist development and are
    approaching the revolution more slowly, but more surely, durably
    and firmly. We find that with every year, and even with every
    month, the number of supporters and friends of the Soviet Republic
    is increasing tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold in every
    capitalist country; and it must be said that we have more friends
    and allies than we imagine!
The attempt of world imperialism to crush us by military force
    has collapsed completely. The international situation has now
    given us a much longer and more durable respite than the one we
    had at the beginning of the revolution. But we must remember that
    this is nothing more than a respite. We must remember that the
    whole capitalist world is armed to the teeth and is only waiting
    for the moment, choosing the best strategical conditions, and
    studying the means of attack. We must never under any
    circumstances forget that all the economic power and all the
    military power is still on its side. We are still weak on an
    international scale, but we are rapidly growing and gaining
    strength, wresting one weapon after another from the hands of the
    enemy. But the enemy is lurking in wait for the Soviet Republic at
    every step. International capital has definite designs, a
    calculated plan, now that the blockade has been removed, to unite,
    to fuse, to weld together international food speculation,
    international freedom of trade, with our own internal food
    speculation, and on the basis of this speculation to pave the way
    for a new war against us, to prepare a new series of traps and
    pitfalls.
And this brings us to that fundamental task which constituted
    the chief theme, the chief object of attention of our
    Congress. That is the task of development. In this respect the
    Congress has done a lot. A resolution has been unanimously adopted
    on the principal question, the question of economic development
    and transport. And now, by means of Party education, we shall be
    able to get this resolution carried into effect by the three
    million working-class members of the trade unions, acting as one
    man. We shall ensure that this resolution channels all our
    strength, discipline and energy to the restoration of the
    country’s economic life—first of all to the
    restoration of the railways, and then to the improvement of the
    food situation.
We have now quite a number of subjects for propaganda and every
    item of news we get from abroad and every new dozen members of the
    Party provide us with fresh material. Propaganda must be carried
    on systematically, without the dispersion and division of
    forces. We must bear firmly in mind that we achieved successes and
    performed miracles in the military sphere because we always
    concentrated on the main and fundamental thing, and solved
    problems in a way that capitalist society could not solve
    them. The point is that in capitalist society everything that
    particularly interests the citizens—their economic
    conditions, war and peace—is decided secretly, apart from
    society itself. The most important questions—war, peace,
    diplomatic questions—are decided by a small handful of
    capitalists, who deceive not only the masses, but very often
    parliament itself. No parliament in the world has ever said
    anything of weight on the question of war and peace. In capitalist
    society the major questions affecting the economic life of the
    working people—whether they are to live in starvation or in
    comfort—are decided by the capitalist—who is the lord,
    a god! In all capitalist countries, including the democratic
    republics, the attention of the people is diverted at such times
    by the corrupt bourgeois press, which wears the label of freedom
    of speech, and which will invent and circulate anything to fool
    and deceive the masses. In our country, on the other hand, the
    whole apparatus of state power, the whole attention of the
    class-conscious worker have been entirely and exclusively centred
    on the major and cardinal issue, on the chief task. We have made
    gigantic progress in this way in the military sphere, and we must
    now apply our experience to the economic sphere.
We are effecting the transition to socialism, and the most
    urgent question—bread and work—is not a private
    question, not the private affair of an employer, but the affair of
    the whole of society, and any peasant who thinks at all must
    definitely realise and understand that if the government raises
    the question of the railways in its whole press, in every article,
    in every newspaper issue, it is because it is the common affair of
    all. This work to develop the country will lead the peasant out of
    the blindness and ignorance that doomed him to slavery; it will
    lead him to real liberty, to a state of affairs in which the
    working folk will be aware of all the difficulties that confront
    them and will direct all the forces of public organisation, all
    the forces of the state apparatus, all the forces of agitation to
    the simplest and most essential things, rejecting all the tinsel
    and trimmings, all the playing at resolutions and the artful
    promises which form the subject of the newspaper agitation of all
    capitalist countries. All our forces, all our attention must be
    centred on these simple economic tasks, which are clear to every
    peasant, to which the middle, even the well-to-do, peasant, if he
    is at all honest, cannot object, and which we are always
    absolutely right in raising at every meeting. Even the masses of
    the least politically-conscious workers and peasants will confirm
    that the chief thing at the moment is to restore the economy in a
    way that will prevent it from falling again into the hands of the
    exploiters and will not offer the slightest indulgence to those
    who, having a surplus of grain in a starving country, use it to
    enrich themselves and to make the poor starve. You will not find a
    single man, however ignorant and unenlightened, who does not have
    the feeling that this is unjust, to whom the idea has not
    occurred, vague and unclear perhaps, that the arguments of the
    supporters of the Soviet government fully accord with the
    interests of the working people. 


 It is to these simple tasks, which in the big capitalist
    societies are kept in the background and are regarded as the
    private affair of the bosses, that we must direct the attention of
    the whole army of 600,000 Party members, among whom we must not
    tolerate a single one who does not do his duty; and for the sake
    of this we must get the whole mass of the workers to join us and
    to display the greatest self-sacrifice and devotion. It will be
    difficult to organise this, but since, from the point of view of
    the working people it is just, it has tremendous moral weight and
    immense power of conviction. And so, confident that, thanks to the
    work of the Congress, this task can now be accomplished as
    brilliantly as we accomplished the military task (although again
    at the price of a number of defeats and mistakes), we may say that
    the workers of all European and American countries are now looking
    towards us, looking with expectancy to see whether we shall
    accomplish the more difficult task confronting us—for it is
    more difficult than the achievement of military victory. It cannot
    be accomplished by enthusiasm, by self-sacrifice and heroic
    fervour alone. In this work of organisation, in which we Russians
    have been weaker than others in this work of self-discipline, in
    this work of rejecting the incidental and striving for the main
    thing, nothing can be done in a hurry. And in this sphere of
    requisitioning grain, repairing the railways, restoring the
    economy, where progress is made only inch by inch, where the
    ground is being prepared, and where what is being done is perhaps
    little, but is durable—in this work, the eyes of the workers
    of all countries are upon us, they expect new victories of us. I
    am convinced that, guided by the decisions of our Congress, with
    the 600,000 members of the Party working like one man, and
    establishing closer ties with the economic bodies and the trade
    union bodies, we shall accomplish this task as successfully as we
    accomplished the military task, and shall march swiftly and surely
    towards the victory of the World Socialist Soviet Republic!
    (Applause.)

    The Ninth Party Congress was held in Moscow from March 29
    to April 5, 1920. The Congress opened in the Bolshoi Theatre with
    an introductory speech by Lenin. The following meetings of the
    Congress took place in one of the buildings of the
    Kremlin. Present at the Congress were 715 delegates, of whom 553
    had the right to vote and 162 were delegates with voice but no
    vote; they represented 611,973 Party members. At the Congress
    there were delegates from the Party organisations of Central
    Russia, the Ukraine, Urals Siberia and of other districts recently
    liberated by the Red Army. Many delegates came to the Congress
    straight from the front.
 The Congress adopted the following agenda: (1)
    Report of the Central Committee; (2) Immediate tasks of economic
    development; (3) Trade union movement; (4) Organisational
    questions; (5) Tasks of the Communist International, (6) Attitude
    to the co-operatives; (7) Transition to the militia system; (8)
    Election to the Central Committee, (9) Other business.
  Lenin guided the work of the Congress. He
    delivered the report on the political work of the Central
    Committee and closed the debate on the report. He also spoke on
    economic development and on co- operation, and made the speech on
    the closing of the Congress. He submitted a proposal on the list
    of candidates for membership to the C.C.
  In its resolution “The Immediate Tasks
    of Economic Construction” the Congress pointed out that
    “the basic condition of economic rehabilitation of the
    country is steady implementation of the single economic plan for
    the coming historical epoch”.
  The Ninth Congress directives were taken as
    the basis for a plan by the State Commission for the
    Electrification of Russia (GOELRO); the final draft of which was
    approved in December 1920 by the All-Russia Congress of
    Soviets. It was the first long-term scientific plan in history for
    the economic development of a vast country; it was calculated to
    create the production and technical basis of socialism.
  Special attention was devoted to the
    organisation of production management. The resolution on the
    question pointed out the necessity of competent, firm and
    energetic one-man management.
  The Congress emphasised the importance of
    utilising the achievements of science, technology and culture in
    the interests of socialist economy. The Congress put forward the
    task of enlisting specialists into the sphere of production and of
    establishing the atmosphere of comradely co-operation between
    workers and specialists. 
 The factional group of Democratic Centralists
    (Sapronov, Osinsky, V. Smirnov and others) opposed the Party line
    on economic development. Using phrases about democratic
    centralism, this group spoke against the use of specialists,
    against centralised state administration, against one-man
    management and the personal responsibility of managers of
    enterprise’s; they insisted on unlimited corporate
    management. That group was supported at the Congress by Rykov,
    Tomsky, Milyutin, and Lomov, who also spoke against the principle
    of one-man management and claimed that corporate management was
    the only principle of management of industry from the Supreme
    Economic Council down to the management of a single factory.
  The Congress resolutely denounced the
    democratic centralism group and rejected their anti-Party
    proposals. 
  Another important question discussed at the
    Congress was that of trade unions in connection with the
    adaptation of their work for economic tasks. The Congress severely
    criticised syndicalist elements (Shlyapnikov, Lozovsky, Tomsky,
    Lutovinov), who advocated the “independence” of trade
    unions and counterposed them to the Communist Party and the Soviet
    power.   The Congress pointed out that the trade unions, as school
    of communism, should organise the proletarian masses, train them
    in the work of management, raise their cultural and political
    level to the standards of communism, and prepare them for the role
    of active builders of communism. 
  At its closed meeting on April 4, the
    Congress elected a new Central Committee of 19 members and 12
    alternate members. A .A. Andreyev, F. E. Dzerzhinsky,
    M. I. Kalinin, V. I. Lenin, Y. E. Rudzutak, F. A. Sergeyev
    (Artyom) were among the newly elected C.C. members.
[2]
    Lenin refers to the savage terror resorted to by the Finnish
    bourgeoisie to suppress the proletarian revolution in 1918. Over
    90,000 people were imprisoned or sent to concentration camps,
    nearly 18,000 were executed and nearly as many died of hunger or
    tortures. The number of victims of White Terror ten times exceeded
    the number of Finnish workers killed in the battles for the
    revolution.
[3] 
      After the November revolution of 1918 in Germany the Right-wing
      leaders of German Social-Democracy exerted every effort to save
      the capitalist system. The Right Social-Democrats and the
      Independents seized the majority of seats in the
      Arbeiterräte which had sprung up during the
      revolution, and at their First All-Germany Congress, held
      December 16-21, 1918, in Berlin, succeeded in carrying through a
      resolution on handing over power to a government representing
      the interests of the bourgeoisie and on convening a Constituent
      Assembly. This actually meant the end of the
      Arbeiterräte. In January 1919
      counter-revolutionary detachments set up by the War Minister
      Noske, Right Social-Democrat, brutally suppressed the
      revolutionary action of the Berlin proletariat. On January 15,
      armed detachments arrested and brutally murdered the leaders of
      the German working class, Karl Liebknecht and Rosa
      Luxemburg. Having crushed the January uprising and destroyed the
      best leaders of the German working class, the German bourgeoisie
      ensured the victory of the bourgeois parties during the
      elections to the Constituent Assembly on January 19, 1919.
[4]  
      The rout of the foreign interventionists and whiteguards in 1919
      and the consolidation of Soviet Russia’s position in the
      world compelled the bourgeois rulers of Latvia to seek a peace
      treaty with the R.S F.S.R. On March 25, 1920, the Ministry for
      Foreign Affairs of Latvia addressed a proposal to the Soviet
      Government to start peace negotiations. The peace conference of
      R.S.F.S.R. and Latvian representatives opened on April 16 in
      Moscow. The peace treaty was signed in Riga on August 11.
[5]
    By the beginning of 1920 Soviet Russia’s position at home
    and abroad had been consolidated, and the ruling circles of
    Finland had to conclude a peace treaty with the R.S.F.S.R. On
    March 25 the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland proposed to
    the Soviet Government to demarcate the frontier that was
    tantamount to starting negotiations on peace. The peace treaty
    between the R.S.F.S.R. and Finland was signed on October 14, 1920
    in the town of Yuryev (now Tartu). It confirmed the independence
    and sovereignty of Finland granted her by the Soviet Government in
    1917. 
[6]The Polish Government’s agreement to
    start negotiations was merely a manoeuvre to cover war
    preparations against the Soviet Republic. In reply to the Soviet
    Government’s many proposals (De-cember 22, 1919, January 28,
    February 2, March 6 1920), the Polish Government gave its consent
    only on March 2, 1920. But the Polish reactionaries sabotaged the
    negotiations and started hostilities on April 25, 1920. In the
    autumn of 1920, however, as a result of the Red Army’s
    offensive the Polish Government had to agree to sign a peace
    treaty. The Treaty on an Armistice and Preliminary Peace Terms was
    signed in Riga on October 12, and the Peace Treaty between the
    R.S.F.S.R. and the Ukrainian S.S.R. on the one side and Poland on
    the other was signed in Riga on March 18, 1921.
[7]
    Lenin refers to S. I. Gusev’s pamphlet “Immediate
    Problems of Economic Development (On C.C., R.C.P.[B.]
    Theses. Materials for the Ninth Party Congress, Saratov,
    1920)”. The paragraph referred to by Lenin was included in
    the draft resolution with slight alterations. 
In Gusev’s pamphlet this point is worded
    as follows: “All enterprises which are not subsidiary to the
    chief economic task of the period should be developed to the
    extent that they do not interfere with the fulfilment of the main
    task. Subsidiary enterprises should be developed as required by
    the main task. In view of this a single economic plan should not
    be the sum total of production programmes worked out by individual
    industries and local economic councils on the basis of orders
    received from central and local organisations, but, on the
    contrary, such a plan should envisage the volume of production for
    each industry.
[8]
    Lenin refers to the meeting of the group of the All-Russia Central
    Council of Trade Unions on March 15, 1920, at which Tomsky’s
    theses on the “Tasks of the Trade Unions” were
    discussed. Lenin sharply criticised the theses, particularly
    article 7 on corporate management as the main method. But the
    All-Russia C.C.T.U. group took up an incorrect stand, and its
    majority voted for Tomsky’s theses.
[9]
    The Decree of the Council of People’s Commissars “On
    Centralisation of Management, Protection of Roads and Raising
    Their Traffic Capacity”, published in Izvestia
    No. 59, March 28, 1918, was demagogically called the “Decree
    on Dictatorship” by the Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries.
[10]
    The Ninth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) set up a special committee to
    discuss the co-operative movement. At its meeting of April 2,
    1920, the committee examined several variants of the theses on the
    co-operatives submitted for discussion at the Congress. The
    committee took as the basis the theses by V. P. Milyutin, who
    proposed to subordinate co-operatives to the state. After
    Lenin’s speech against Milyutin’s theses, the Congress
    by a majority vote passed a resolution which Lenin had
    supported.

Our newspaper[1] is devoted to the
    problem of communist labour. 
This is the paramount problem in the building of
    socialism. First of all, we must make it quite clear to ourselves
    that this question could be raised in a practical way only after
    the proletariat had captured political power, only after the
    landowners and capitalists had been expropriated, only after the
    proletariat, having captured state power, had achieved decisive
    victories over the exploiters who put up a desperate resistance
    and organised counter-revolutionary rebellions and civil war. 
It seemed that the time had arrived early in 1918—and it
    had indeed arrived after the February (1918) military campaign of
    German imperialism against Russia. But on that occasion the period
    was so short-lived, a new and more powerful wave of
    counter-revolutionary rebellions and invasions swept over us so
    quickly, that the Soviet government had no opportunity, to devote
    itself at all closely and persistently to problems of peaceful
    development. 
We have now passed through two years of unprecedented and
    incredible difficulties, two years of famine, privation, and
    distress, accompanied by the unprecedented victories of the Red
    Army over the hordes of international capitalist reaction. 
Today there are serious grounds for hoping (if the French
    capitalists do not incite Poland to make war on us) that we shall
    get a more durable and lasting peace. 
 
    

      During these two years we have acquired some experience in
      organisation on the basis of socialism. That is why we can, and
      should, get right down to the problem of communist labour, or
      rather, it would be more correct to say, not communist, but
      socialist labour; for we are dealing not with the higher, but
      the lower, the primary stage of development of the new social
      system that is growing out of capitalism. 
Communist labour in the narrower and stricter sense of the term
    is labour performed gratis for the benefit of society, labour
    performed not as a definite duty, not for the purpose of obtaining
    a right to certain products, not according to previously
    established and legally fixed quotas, but voluntary labour,
    irrespective of quotas; it is labour performed without expectation
    of reward, without reward as a condition, labour performed because
    it has become a habit to work for the common good, and because of
    a conscious realisation (that has become a habit) of the necessity
    of working for the common good—labour as the requirement of
    a healthy organism. 
It must be clear to everybody that we, i.e., our society, our
    social system, are still a very long way from the application of
    this form of labour on a broad, really mass scale. 
But the very fact that this question has been raised, and
    raised both by the whole of the advanced proletariat (the
    Communist Party and the trade unions) and by the state
    authorities, is a step in this direction. 
To achieve big things we must start with little things. 
On the other hand, after the "big things", after the revolution
    which overthrew capitalist ownership and placed the proletariat in
    power, the organisation of economic life on the new basis
    can only start from little things. 
Subbotniks, labour armies, labour conscription—these are
    the practical realisation of socialist and communist labour in
    various forms. 
This practical realisation still suffers from numerous
    defects. Only people who are totally incapable of thinking, if we
    leave aside the champions of capitalism, can laugh scornfully (or
    rage) at them. 
Defects, mistakes, blunders in such a new, difficult and great
    undertaking are inevitable. Those who are afraid of the
    difficulties of building socialism, those who allow themselves to
    be scared by them, those who give way to despair or cowardly
    dismay, are no socialists. 
It will take many years, decades, to create a new labour
    discipline, new forms of social ties between people, and new forms
    and methods of drawing people into labour. 
It is a most gratifying and noble work. 
It is our good fortune that, by overthrowing the bourgeoisie
    and suppressing its resistance, we have been able to win the
    ground on which this work has become possible. 
And we will set about this work with all our
    might. Perseverance, persistence, willingness, determination and
    ability to test things a hundred times, to correct them a hundred
    times, but to achieve the goal come what may—these are
    qualities which the proletariat acquired in the course of the ten,
    fifteen or twenty years that preceded the October Revolution, and
    which it has acquired in the two years that have passed since this
    revolution, years of unprecedented privation, hunger, ruin and
    destitution. These qualities of the proletariat are a guarantee
    that the proletariat will conquer.

    This refers to the newspaper Kommunistichesky Subbotnik
    issued on one occasion only on the initiative of the Moscow
    Committee of the R.C.P.(B.). It was prepared by the editors of and
    contributors to the Moscow newspapers Pravda,
    Izvestia, Bednota, Ekonomicheskaya
    Zhizn, Kommunistichesky Trud and the ROSTA telegraph
    agency during the subbotnik of April 10, 1920. The initiative was
    supported by printers who participated with great enthusiasm in
    the first "newspaper" subbotnik. The newspaper was set and printed
    in the printing-shop of the All-Russia C.E.C. and circulated on
    April 11. Among its contributors were Lenin, Yaroslavsky,
    Kollontai, Demyan Bedny, Serafimovich and Timiryazev.

      With this now-classic work, Lenin aimed to encapsulate the
      lessons the Bolshevik Party had learned from its involvement in
      three revolutions in 12 years—in a manner that European
      Communists could relate to, for it was to them he was
      speaking. He also further develops the theory of what the
      “dictatorship of the proletariat” means and stresses that the
      primary danger for the working-class movement in general is
      opportunism on the one hand, and anti-Marxist ultraleftism on
      the other.

    

“Left-Wing” Communism: an Infantile Disorder was
      written in April, and the appendix was written on May 12,
      1920. It came out on June 8–10 in Russian and in July was
      published in German, English and French. Lenin gave personal
      attention to the book’s type-setting and printing schedule so
      that it would be published before the opening of the Second
      Congress of the Communist International, each delegate receiving
      a copy. Between July and November 1920, the book was
      republished in Leipzig, Paris, and London, in the German, French,
      and English languages respectively.

    

“Left-Wing” Communism: an Infantile Disorder is
      published according to the first edition print, the proofs of
      which were read by Lenin himself.

Comrades: You know that, instigated by the Entente,
    the Polish landowners and capitalists have forced a new war on
    us. Remember, comrades, that we have no quarrel with the Polish
    peasants and workers; we have recognised Poland’s
    independence and the Polish People’s Republic, and shall
    continue to do so. We have proposed peace to Poland on the basis
    of the integrity of her frontiers, although these frontiers extend
    far beyond the purely Polish population. We have agreed to make
    all concessions, which is something each of you should remember at
    the front. Let your attitude to the Poles there prove that you are
    soldiers of a workers’ and peasants’ republic, that
    you are coming to them, not as aggressors but as liberators. Now
    that, despite our efforts, the Polish magnates have concluded an
    alliance with Petlyura, launched an offensive, are approaching
    Kiev, and are spreading rumours in the foreign press that they
    have already captured Kiev—which is the sheerest fabrication
    since only yesterday I was talking on the direct line with F. Kon,
    who is in Kiev—we say: Comrades, we have been able to repel
    a more terrible enemy; we have been able to defeat our own
    landowners and capitalists, and we shall defeat the Polish
    landowners and capitalists too! All of us here today should pledge
    ourselves, give a solemn promise, that we shall stand as one man
    so as not to allow a victory of the Polish magnates and
    capitalists. Long live the peasants and workers of a free
    independent Polish Republic! Down with the Polish magnates,
    landowners and capitalists! Long live our Red Workers’ and
    Peasants’ Army! (The mighty strains of the
    "Internationale" and cries of "Hurrah" drown Comrade
    Lenin’s final words.)

      June 5, 1920
 1) An abstract or formal posing of the problem of equality in
    general and national equality in particular is in the very nature
    of bourgeois democracy. Under the guise of the equality of the
    individual in general, bourgeois democracy proclaims the formal or
    legal equality of the property-owner and the proletarian, the
    exploiter and the exploited, thereby grossly deceiving the
    oppressed classes. On the plea that all men are absolutely equal,
    the bourgeoisie is transforming the idea of equality, which is
    itself a reflection of relations in commodity production, into a
    weapon in its struggle against the abolition of classes. The real
    meaning of the demand for equality consists in its being a demand
    for the abolition of classes. 

    

      2) In conformity with its fundamental task of combating
         bourgeois democracy and exposing its falseness and hypocrisy,
         the Communist Party, as the avowed champion of the
         proletarian struggle to overthrow the bourgeois yoke, must
         base its policy, in the national question too, not on
         abstract and formal principles but, first, on a precise
         appraisal of the specific historical situation and,
         primarily, of economic conditions; second, on a clear
         distinction between the interests of the oppressed classes,
         of working and exploited people, and the general concept of
         national interests as a whole, which implies the interests of
         the ruling class; third, on an equally clear distinction
         between the oppressed, dependent and subject nations and the
         oppressing, exploiting and sovereign nations, in order to
         counter the bourgeois-democratic lies that play down this
         colonial and financial enslavement of the vast majority of
         the world’s population by an insignificant minority of
         the richest and advanced capitalist countries, a feature
         characteristic of the era of finance capital and
         imperialism. 
 3) The imperialist war of 1914-18 has very clearly revealed to
    all nations and to the oppressed classes of the whole world the
    falseness of bourgeois-democratic phrases, by practically
    demonstrating that the Treaty of Versailles of the celebrated
    “Western democracies” is an even more brutal and foul
    act of violence against weak nations than was the Treaty of
    Brest-Litovsk of the German Junkers and the Kaiser. The League of
    Nations and the entire post war policy of the Entente reveal this
    truth with even greater clarity and distinctness. They are
    everywhere intensifying the revolutionary struggle both of the
    proletariat in the advanced countries and of the toiling masses in
    the colonial and dependent countries. They are hastening the
    collapse of the petty-bourgeois nationalist illusions that nations
    can live together in peace and equality under capitalism. 
 4) From these fundamental premises it follows that the
    Communist International’s entire policy on the national and
    the colonial questions should rest primarily on a closer union of
    the proletarians and the working masses of all nations and
    countries for a joint revolutionary struggle to overthrow the
    landowners and the bourgeoisie. This union alone will guarantee
    victory over capitalism, without which the abolition of national
    oppression and inequality is impossible. 
 5) The world political situation has now placed the
    dictatorship of the proletariat on the order of the day. World
    political developments are of necessity concentrated on a single
    focus—the struggle of the world bourgeoisie against the
    Soviet Russian Republic, around which are inevitably grouped, on
    the one hand, the Soviet movements of the advanced workers in all
    countries, and, on the other, all the national liberation
    movements in the colonies and among the oppressed nationalities,
    who are learning from bitter experience that their only salvation
    lies in the Soviet system’s victory over world
    imperialism. 
 6) Consequently, one cannot at present confine oneself to a
    bare recognition or proclamation of the need for closer union
    between the working people of the various nations; a policy must
    be pursued that will achieve the closest alliance, with Soviet
    Russia, of all the national and colonial liberation movements. The
    form of this alliance should be determined by the degree of
    development of the communist movement in the proletariat of each
    country, or of the bourgeois-democratic liberation movement of the
    workers and peasants in backward countries or among backward
    nationalities. 
 7) Federation is a transitional form to the complete unity of
    the working people of different nations. The feasibility of
    federation has already been demonstrated in practice both by the
    relations between the R.S.F.S.R. and other Soviet Republics (the
    Hungarian, Finnish[2] and Latvian[3] in the past, and the
    Azerbaijan and Ukrainian at present), and by the relations within
    the R.S.F.S.R. in respect of nationalities which formerly enjoyed
    neither statehood nor autonomy (e.g., the Bashkir and Tatar
    autonomous republics in the R.S.F.S.R., founded in 1919 and 1920
    respectively).
 8) In this respect, it is the task of the Communist
    International to further develop and also to study and test by
    experience these new federations, which are arising on the basis
    of the Soviet system and the Soviet movement. In recognising that
    federation is a transitional form to complete unity, it is
    necessary to strive for ever closer federal unity, bearing in
    mind, first, that the Soviet republics, surrounded as they are by
    the imperialist powers of the whole world—which from the
    military standpoint are immeasurably stronger—cannot
    possibly continue to exist without the closest alliance; second,
    that a close economic alliance between the Soviet republics is
    necessary, otherwise the productive forces which have been ruined
    by imperialism cannot be restored and the well-being of the
    working people cannot be ensured; third, that there is a tendency
    towards the creation of a single world economy, regulated by the
    proletariat of all nations as an integral whole and according to a
    common plan. This tendency has already revealed itself quite
    clearly under capitalism and is bound to be further developed and
    consummated under socialism. 
 9) The Communist International’s national policy in the
    sphere of relations within the state cannot be restricted to the
    bare, formal, purely declaratory and actually non-committal
    recognition of the equality of nations to which the bourgeois
    democrats confine themselves—both those who frankly admit
    being such, and those who assume the name of socialists (such as
    the socialists of the Second International). 
 In all their propaganda and agitation—both within
    parliament and outside it—the Communist parties must
    consistently expose that constant violation of the equality of
    nations and of the guaranteed rights of national minorities which
    is to be seen in all capitalist countries, despite their
    “democratic” constitutions. It is also necessary,
    first, constantly to explain that only the Soviet system is
    capable of ensuring genuine equality of-nations, by uniting first
    the proletarians and then the whole mass of the working population
    in the struggle against the bourgeoisie; and, second, that all
    Communist parties should render direct aid to the revolutionary
    movements among the dependent and underprivileged nations (for
    example, Ireland, the American Negroes, etc.) and in the
    colonies. 
 Without the latter condition, which is particularly important,
    the struggle against the oppression of dependent nations and
    colonies, as well as recognition of their right to secede, are but
    a false signboard, as is evidenced by the parties of the Second
    International. 
 10) Recognition of internationalism in word, and its
    replacement in deed by petty-bourgeois nationalism and pacifism,
    in all propaganda, agitation and practical work, is very common,
    not only among the parties of the Second International, but also
    among those which have withdrawn from it, and often even among
    parties which now call themselves communist. The urgency of the
    struggle against this evil, against the most deep-rooted
    petty-bourgeois national prejudices, looms ever larger with the
    mounting exigency of the task of converting the dictatorship of
    the proletariat from a national dictatorship (i.e., existing in a
    single country and incapable of determining world politics) into
    an international one (i.e., a dictatorship of the proletariat
    involving at least several advanced countries, and capable of
    exercising a decisive influence upon world politics as a
    whole). Petty-bourgeois nationalism proclaims as internationalism
    the mere recognition of the equality of nations, and nothing
    more. Quite apart from the fact that this recognition is purely
    verbal, petty-bourgeois nationalism preserves national
    self-interest intact, whereas proletarian internationalism
    demands, first, that the interests of the proletarian struggle in
    any one country should be subordinated to the interests of that
    struggle on a world-wide scale, and, second, that a nation which
    is achieving victory over the bourgeoisie should be able and
    willing to make the greatest national sacrifices for the overthrow
    of international capital. 
 Thus, in countries that are already fully capitalist and have
    workers’ parties that really act as the vanguard of the
    proletariat, the struggle against opportunist and petty-bourgeois
    pacifist distortions of the concept and policy of internationalism
    is a primary and cardinal task. 
 11) With regard to the more backward states and nations, in
    which feudal or patriarchal and patriarchal-peasant relations
    predominate, it is particularly important to bear in mind: 
 first, that all Communist parties must assist the
    bourgeois-democratic liberation movement in these countries, and
    that the duty of rendering the most active assistance rests
    primarily with the workers of the country the backward nation is
    colonially or financially dependent on; 
 second, the need for a struggle against the clergy and other
    influential reactionary and medieval elements in backward
    countries; 
 third, the need to combat Pan-Islamism and similar trends,
    which strive to combine the liberation movement against European
    and American imperialism with an attempt to strengthen the
    positions of the khans, landowners, mullahs, etc.;[In the proofs Lenin inserted a brace opposite
    points 2 and 3 and wrote “2 and 3 to be
    united”.—Editor.]

      fourth, the need, in backward countries, to give special support
      to the peasant movement against the landowners, against landed
      proprietorship, and against all manifestations or survivals of
      feudalism, and to strive to lend the peasant movement the most
      revolutionary character by establishing the closest possible
      alliance between the West European communist proletariat and the
      revolutionary peasant movement in the East, in the colonies, and
      in the backward countries generally. It is particularly
      necessary to exert every effort to apply the basic principles of
      the Soviet system in countries where pre-capitalist relations
      predominate—by setting up “working people’s
      Soviets”,  etc.; 

      fifth, the need for a determined struggle against attempts to
      give a communist colouring to bourgeois-democratic liberation
      trends in the backward countries; the Communist International
      should support bourgeois-democratic national movements in
      colonial and backward countries only on condition that, in these
      countries, the elements of future proletarian parties, which
      will be communist not only in name, are brought together and
      trained to understand their special tasks, i.e., those of the
      struggle against the bourgeois-democratic movements within their
      own nations. The Communist International must enter into a
      temporary alliance with bourgeois democracy in the colonial and
      backward countries, but should not merge with it, and should
      under all circumstances uphold the independence of the
      proletarian movement even if it is in its most embryonic form;
      

      sixth, the need constantly to explain and expose among the
      broadest working masses of all countries, and particularly of
      the backward countries, the deception systematically practised
      by the imperialist powers, which, under the guise of politically
      independent states, set up states that are wholly dependent upon
      them economically, financially and militarily. Under present-day
      international conditions there is no salvation for dependent and
      weak nations except in a union of Soviet republics. 

      12) The age-old oppression of colonial and weak nationalities by
      the imperialist powers has not only filled the working
      masses of the oppressed countries with animosity towards the
      oppressor nations, but has also aroused distrust in these
      nations in general, even in their proletariat. The
      despicable betrayal of socialism by the majority of the
      official leaders of this proletariat in 1914-19, when
      “defence of country” was used as a
      social-chauvinist cloak to conceal the defence of the
      “right” of their “own” bourgeoisie
      to oppress colonies and fleece financially dependent
      countries, was certain to enhance this perfectly legitimate
      distrust. On the other hand, the more backward the country,
      the stronger is the hold of small-scale agricultural
      production, patriarchalism and isolation, which inevitably
      lend particular strength and tenacity to the deepest of
      petty-bourgeois prejudices, i.e., to national egoism and
      national narrow-mindedness. These prejudices are bound to
      die out very slowly, for they can disappear only after
      imperialism and capitalism have disappeared in the advanced
      countries, and after the entire foundation of the backward
      countries’ economic life has radically changed.

      It is therefore the duty of the class-conscious communist
      proletariat of all countries to regard with particular caution
      and attention the survivals of national sentiments in the
      countries and among nationalities which have been oppressed the
      longest; it is equally necessary to make certain concessions
      with a view to more rapidly overcoming this distrust and these
      prejudices. Complete victory over capitalism cannot be won
      unless the proletariat and, following it, the mass of working
      people in all countries and nations throughout the world
      voluntarily strive for alliance and unity.

    Notes to “Preliminary Draft Theses on the National and the
    Colonial Questions” were received by Lenin from
    G. V. Chicherin, N. N. Krestinsky, J. V. Stalin, M. G. Rafes,
    Y. A. Preobrazhensky, N. D. Lapinsky, and I. Nedelkov
    (N. Shablin), representative of the Bulgarian Communists, as well
    as from a number of leaders in Bashkiria, Kirghizia, and
    Turkestan. Along with correct ideas, the notes contained certain
    grave errors. Thus, Chicherin gave a wrong interpretation to
    Lenin’s theses on the necessity of support for national
    liberation movements and on agreements with the national
    bourgeoisie, without due regard for Lenin’s distinction
    between the bourgeoisie and the peasantry. With regard to this
    Lenin wrote: “I lay greater stress on the alliance
    with the peasantry (which does not quite mean the
    bourgeoisie)” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
    Marxism-Leninism of the C.C. C.P.S.U.). Referring to the relations
    between the future socialist Europe and the economically
    underdeveloped and dependent countries, Preobrazhensky wrote:
    “. . . if it proves impossible to reach economic agreement
    with the leading national groups, the latter will inevitably be
    suppressed by force and economically important regions will be
    compelled to join a union of European Republics.” Lenin
    decisively objected to this remark: “. . . it goes too
    far. It cannot be proved, and it is wrong to say that
    suppression by force is “inevitable”. That is
    radically wrong” (see Voprosy Istorii KPSS
    [Problems of the C.P.S.U. History] 1958, No. 2,
    p. 16).
 A grave error was made by Stalin, who did not
    agree with Lenin’s proposition on the difference between
    federal relations among the Soviet republics based on autonomy,
    and federal relations among independent republics. In a letter to
    Lenin, dated June 12, 1920, he declared that in reality
    “there is no difference between these two types of federal
    relations, or else it is so small as to be
    negligible”. Stalin continued to advocate this later, when,
    in 1922, he proposed the “autonomisation” of the
    independent Soviet republics. These ideas were criticised in
    detail by Lenin in his article “The Question of
    Nationalities or ’Autonomisation’”,  and in his
    letter to members of the Political Bureau “On the Formation
    of the U.S.S.R” (see present edition, Vol. 36, and Lenin
    Miscellany XXXVI; pp. 496-98).
[2]
    As a result of the revolution which commenced in Finland on
    January 27, 1918, the bourgeois government of Svinhufvud was
    overthrown and the working class assumed power. On January 29, the
    revolutionary government of Finland, the Council of People’s
    Representatives was formed by Edvard Gylling, Yrjö Sirola,
    Otto Kuusinen, A. Taimi and others. The following were among the
    most important measures taken by the workers’ government:
    the law on the transfer to landless peasants, without
    indemnification, of the land they actually tilled; tax-exemption
    for the poorest sections of the population; the expropriation of
    enterprises whose owners had fled the country; the establishment
    of state control over private banks (their functions being assumed
    by the State Bank).
 On March 1, 1918, a treaty between the Finnish
    Socialist Workers’ Republic and the R.S.F.S.R. was signed in
    Petrograd. Based on the principle of complete equality and respect
    for the sovereignty of the two sides, this was the first treaty in
    world history to be signed between two socialist countries. 
 The proletarian revolution, however, was
    victorious only in the south of Finland. The Svinhufvud government
    concentrated all counter-revolutionary forces in the north of the
    country, and appealed to the German Kaiser’s government for
    help. As a result of German armed intervention, the Finnish
    revolution was put down in May 1918, after a desperate civil
    war. White terror reigned in the country, tens of thousands of
    revolutionary workers and peasants were executed or tortured to
    death in the prisons. 
[3]As
    a result of mass action by the Lettish proletariat and peasantry
    against the German invaders and the counter-revolutionary
    government of Ulmanis, a provisional Soviet government was
    established in Latvia on December 17, 1918, which issued a
    Manifesto on the assumption of state power by the Soviets. Soviet
    Russia gave fraternal help to the Lettish people in their struggle
    to establish Soviet rule and strengthen the Latvian Soviet
    Socialist Republic.
 Under the leadership of the Latvian Communist
    Party and the Latvian Soviet Government, a Red Army was formed,
    the landed estates were confiscated, the banks and big commercial
    and industrial enterprises were nationalised, social insurance and
    an eight-hour working day were introduced, and a system of public
    catering for working people was organised.
 In March 1919, German troops and the
    whiteguards, armed and equipped by the U.S. and the Entente
    imperialists, attacked Soviet Latvia. In May they captured Riga,
    the capital of Soviet Latvia. After fierce fighting the entire
    territory of Latvia had been overrun by the interventionists by
    the beginning of 1920. The counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie
    established a regime of bloody terror, thousands of revolutionary
    workers and peasants being killed or thrown into prison.

In his article,[1] Comrade Marchlewski gave an excellent explanation of the reasons why the Second International, which has now become the yellow International, failed, not only to define the revolutionary proletariat’s tactics on the agrarian question, but even to pose that question properly. Comrade Marchlewski then went on to set forth the theoretical fundamentals of the Third International’s communist agrarian programme.
These fundamentals can (and, I think, should) serve as the basis of the general resolution on the agrarian question for the Communist International Congress, which will meet on July 15, 1920.
The following is a preliminary draft of that resolution:
1)Only the urban and industrial proletariat, led by the Communist Party, can liberate the working masses of the countryside from the yoke of capital and landed proprietorship, from ruin and the imperialist wars which will inevitably break out again and again if the capitalist system remains. There is no salvation for the working masses of the countryside except in alliance with the communist proletariat, and unless they give the latter devoted support in its revolutionary struggle to throw off the yoke of the landowners (the big landed proprietors) and the bourgeoisie.
On the other hand, the industrial workers cannot accomplish their epoch-making mission of emancipating mankind from the yoke of capital and from wars if they confine themselves to their narrow craft, or trade interests, and smugly restrict themselves to attaining an improvement in their own conditions, which may sometimes be tolerable in the petty-bourgeois sense. This is exactly what happens to the “labour aristocracy” of many advanced countries, who constitute the core of the so-called socialist parties of the Second International; they are actually the bitter enemies and betrayers of socialism, petty-bourgeois chauvinists and agents of the bourgeoisie within the working-class movement. The proletariat is a really revolutionary class and acts in a really socialist manner only when it comes out and acts as the vanguard of all the working and exploited people, as their leader in the struggle for the overthrow of the exploiters; this, however, cannot be achieved unless the class struggle is carried into the countryside, unless the rural working masses are united about the Communist Party of the urban proletariat, and unless they are trained by the proletariat.
2)The working and exploited people of the countryside, whom the urban proletariat must lead into the struggle or, at all events, win over, are represented in all capitalist countries by the following classes:
first, the agricultural proletariat, wage-labourers (by the year, season, or day), who obtain their livelihood by working for hire at capitalist agricultural enterprises. The organisation of this class (political, military, trade union, co-operative, cultural, educational, etc.) independently and separately from other groups of the rural population, the conduct of intensive propaganda and agitation among this class, and the winning of its support for the Soviets and the dictatorship of the proletariat constitute the fundamental tasks of the Communist parties in all countries;
second, the semi-proletarians or peasants who till tiny plots of land, i.e., those who obtain their livelihood partly as wage-labourers at agricultural and industrial capitalist enterprises and partly by working their own or rented plots of land, which provide their families only with part of their means of subsistence. This group of the rural working population is very numerous in all capitalist countries; its existence and special position are played down by the representatives of the bourgeoisie and by the yellow “socialists” belonging to the Second International, partly by deliberately deceiving the workers and partly by blindly submitting to the routine of petty-bourgeois views and lumping together this group with the mass of the “peasantry”. This bourgeois method of duping the workers is to be seen mostly in Germany and in France, but also in America and other countries. If the work of the Communist Party is properly organised, this group will become its assured supporter, for the lot of these semi-proletarians is a very hard one and they stand to gain enormously and immediately from Soviet government and the dictatorship of the proletariat:
third, the small peasantry, i.e., the small-scale tillers who, either as owners or as tenants, hold small plots of land which enable them to satisfy the needs of their families and their farms, and do not hire outside labour. This stratum, as such, undoubtedly stands to gain by the victory of the proletariat, which will fully and immediately bring it: (a) deliverance from the necessity of paying the big landowners rent or a share of the crop (for example, the métayers in France, also in Italy and other countries); (b) deliverance from mortgages; (c) deliverance from the numerous forms of oppression by and dependence on the big landowners (forest lands and their use, etc.); (d) immediate aid for their farms from the proletarian state (the use of the agricultural implements and part of the buildings on the big capitalist farms confiscated by the proletariat and the immediate conversion, by the proletarian state, of the rural co-operative societies and agricultural associations from organisations which under capitalism served above all the rich and middle peasants, into organisations that will primarily assist the poor, i.e., proletarians, semi-proletarians, small peasants, etc.), and many other things.
At the same time the Communist Party must clearly realise that during the transitional period from capitalism to communism, i.e., during the dictatorship of the proletariat, this stratum, or at all events part of it, will inevitably vacillate towards unrestricted freedom of trade and the free enjoyment of the rights of private property. That is because this stratum, which, if only in a small way, is a seller of articles of consumption, has been corrupted by profiteering and by proprietary habits. However, if a firm proletarian policy is pursued, and if the victorious proletariat deals very resolutely with the big landowners and the big peasants, this stratum’s vacillation cannot be considerable and cannot alter the fact that, on the whole, it will side with the proletarian revolution.
3)Taken together, the three groups enumerated above constitute the majority of the rural population in all capitalist countries. That is why the success of the proletarian revolution is fully assured, not only in the cities but in the countryside as well. The reverse view is widespread; however, it persists only, first, because of the deception systematically practised by bourgeois science and statistics, which do everything to gloss over both the gulf that separates the above-mentioned classes in the countryside from the exploiters, the landowners and capitalists, and that which separates the semi-proletarians and small peasants from the big peasants; second, it persists because of the inability and unwillingness of the heroes of the yellow Second International and of the “labour aristocracy” in the advanced countries, which has been corrupted by imperialist privileges, to conduct genuinely proletarian revolutionary work of propaganda, agitation and organisation among the rural poor; the attention of the opportunists has always been and still is wholly concentrated on inventing theoretical and practical compromises with the bourgeoisie, including the big and middle peasants (who are dealt with below), and not on the revolutionary overthrow of the bourgeois government and the bourgeoisie by the proletariat; it persists, third, because of the obstinate refusal to understand—so obstinate as to be equivalent to a prejudice (connected with all the other bourgeois-democratic and parliamentary prejudices)—a truth which has been fully proved by Marxist theory and fully corroborated by the experience of the proletarian revolution in Russia, namely, that although the three enumerated categories of the rural population—who are incredibly downtrodden, disunited, crushed, and doomed to semi-barbarous conditions of existence in all countries, even the most advanced—are economically, socially, and culturally interested in the victory of socialism, they are capable of giving resolute support to the revolutionary proletariat only after the latter has won political power, only after it has resolutely dealt with the big landowners and capitalists, and only after these downtrodden people see in practice that they have an organised leader and champion, strong and firm enough to assist and lead them and to show them the right path.
4)In the economic sense, one should understand by “middle peasants” those small farmers who, (1) either as owners or tenants, hold plots of land that are also small but, under capitalism, are sufficient not only to provide, as a general rule, a meagre subsistence for the family and the bare minimum needed to maintain the farm, but also produce a certain surplus which may, in good years at least, be converted into capital; (2) quite frequently (for example, one farm out of two or three) resort to the employment of hired labour. A concrete example of the middle peasants in an advanced capitalist country is provided by the group of farms of five to ten hectares in Germany, in which, according to the census of 1907, the number of farms employing hired labourers is about one-third of the total number of farms in this group.[2] In France, where the cultivation of special crops is more developed—for example, grape-growing, which requires a very large amount of labour—this group probably employs outside hired labour to a somewhat greater extent.
The revolutionary proletariat cannot set itself the task—at least not in the immediate future or in the initial period of the dictatorship of the proletariat—of winning over this stratum, but must confine itself to the task of neutralising it, i.e., rendering it neutral in the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. This stratum inevitably vacillates between these two forces; in the beginning of the new epoch and in the developed capitalist countries, it will, in the main, incline towards the bourgeoisie. That is because the world outlook and the sentiments of the property-owners are prevalent among this stratum, which has a direct interest in profiteering, in “freedom” of trade and in property, and stands in direct antagonism to the wage-workers. By abolishing rent and mortgages, the victorious proletariat will immediately improve the position of this stratum. In most capitalist countries, however, the proletarian state should not at once completely abolish private property; at all events, it guarantees both the small and the middle peasantry, not only the preservation of their plots of land but also their enlargement to cover the total area they usually rented (the abolition of rent).
A combination of such measures with a ruthless struggle against the bourgeoisie fully guarantees the success of the policy of neutralisation. The proletarian state must effect the transition to collective farming with extreme caution and only very gradually, by the force of example, without any coercion of the middle peasant.
5)The big peasants (Grossbauern ) are capitalist entrepreneurs in agriculture, who as a rule employ several hired labourers and are connected with the “peasantry” only in their low cultural level, habits of life, and the manual labour they themselves perform on their farms. These constitute the biggest of the bourgeois strata who are open and determined enemies of the revolutionary proletariat. In all their work in the countryside, the Communist parties must concentrate their attention mainly on the struggle against this stratum, on liberating the toiling and exploited majority of the rural population from the ideological and political influence of these exploiters, etc.
Following the victory of the proletariat in the cities, all sorts of manifestations of resistance and sabotage, as well as direct armed action of a counter-revolutionary character on the part of this stratum, are absolutely inevitable. The revolutionary proletariat must therefore immediately begin the ideological and organisational preparation of the forces necessary to completely disarm this stratum and, simultaneously with the overthrow of the capitalists in industry, to deal this stratum a most determined, ruthless and smashing blow at the very first signs of resistance; for this purpose, the rural proletariat must be armed and village Soviets organised, in which the exploiters must have no place, and in which proletarians and semi-proletarians must be ensured predominance.
However, the expropriation even of the big peasants can in no way be made an immediate task of the victorious proletariat, because the material and especially the technical conditions, as well as the social conditions, for the socialisation of such farms are still lacking. In individual and probably exceptional cases, those parts of their land which they rent out in small plots or which are particularly needed by the surrounding small-peasant population will be confiscated; the small peasants should also be guaranteed, on certain terms, the free use of part of the agricultural machinery belonging to the big peasants, etc. As a general rule, however, the proletarian state must allow the big peasants to retain their land, confiscating it only if they resist the power of the working and exploited people. The experience of the Russian proletarian revolution, in which the struggle against the big peasantry was complicated and protracted by a number of special conditions, showed nevertheless that, when taught a severe lesson for the slightest attempt at resistance, this stratum is capable of loyally fulfilling the tasks set by the proletarian state, and even begins to be imbued although very slowly with respect for the government which protects all who work and is ruthless towards the idle rich.
The special conditions which, in Russia, complicated and retarded the struggle of the proletariat against the big peasants after it had defeated the bourgeoisie were, in the main, the following: after October 25 (November 7), 1917, the Russian revolution passed through the stage of the “general democratic”—that is, basically the bourgeois democratic—struggle of the peasantry as a whole against the landowners; the cultural and numerical weakness of the urban proletariat; and, lastly, the enormous distances and extremely poor means of communication. Inasmuch as these retarding conditions do not exist in the advanced countries, the revolutionary proletariat of Europe and America should prepare far more energetically, and achieve far more rapidly, resolutely, and successfully, complete victory over the resistance of the big peasantry, completely depriving it of the slightest possibility of offering resistance. This is imperative because, until such a complete and absolute victory is achieved, the masses of the rural proletarians, semi-proletarians, and small peasants cannot be brought to accept the proletarian state as a fully stable one.
6) The revolutionary proletariat must immediately and unreservedly confiscate all landed estates, those of the big landowners, who, in capitalist countries—directly or through their tenant farmers—systematically exploit wage-labour and the neighbouring small (and, not infrequently, part of the middle) peasantry, do not themselves engage in manual labour, and are in the main descended from the feudal lords (the nobles in Russia, Germany, and Hungary, the restored seigneurs in France, the lords in Britain, and the former slave-owners in America), or are rich financial magnates, or else a mixture of both these categories of exploiters and parasites.
Under no circumstances is it permissible for Communist parties to advocate or practise compensating the big landowners for the confiscated lands, for under present day conditions in Europe and America this would be tantamount to a betrayal of socialism and the imposition of new tribute upon the masses of working and exploited people, to whom the war has meant the greatest hardships, while it has increased the number of millionaires and enriched them.
As to the mode of cultivation of the land that the victorious proletariat confiscates from the big landowners, the distribution of that land among the peasantry for their use has been predominant in Russia, owing to her economic backwardness; it is only in relatively rare and exceptional cases that state farms have been organised on the former estates which the proletarian state runs at its own expense, converting the former wage-labourers into workers for the state and members of the Soviets, which administer the state. The Communist International is of the opinion that in the case of the advanced capitalist countries it would be correct to keep most of the big agricultural enterprises intact and to conduct them on the lines of the “state farms” in Russia.
It would, however, be grossly erroneous to exaggerate or to stereotype this rule and never to permit the free grant of part of the land that belonged to the expropriated expropriators to the neighbouring small and sometimes middle peasants.
First, the objection usually raised to this, namely, that large-scale farming is technically superior, often amounts to an indisputable theoretical truth being replaced by the worst kind of opportunism and betrayal of the revolution. To achieve the success of this revolution, the proletariat should not shrink from a temporary decline in production, any more than the bourgeois opponents of slavery in North America shrank from a temporary decline in cotton production as a consequence of the Civil War of 1863-65. What is most important to the bourgeois is production for the sake of production; what is most important to the working and exploited population is the overthrow of the exploiters and the creation of conditions that will permit the working people to work for themselves, and not for the capitalists. It is the primary and fundamental task of the proletariat to ensure the proletarian victory and its stability. There can, however, be no stable proletarian government unless the middle peasantry is neutralised and the support is secured of a very considerable section of the small peasantry, if not all of them.
Second, not merely an increase but even the preservation of large-scale production in agriculture presupposes the existence of a fully developed and revolutionarily conscious rural proletariat with considerable experience of trade union and political organisation behind it. Where this condition does not yet exist, or where this work cannot expediently be entrusted to class-conscious and competent industrial workers, hasty attempts to set up large state conducted farms can only discredit the proletarian government. Under such conditions, the utmost caution must be exercised and the most thorough preparations made when state farms are set up.
Third, in all capitalist countries, even the most advanced, there still exist survivals of medieval, semi-feudal exploitation of the neighbouring small peasants by the big landowners as in the case of the Instleute[Tenant farmers.—Editor.] in Germany, the métayers in France, and the sharecroppers in the United States (not only Negroes, who, in the Southern States, are mostly exploited in this way, but sometimes whites too). In such cases it is incumbent on the proletarian state to grant the small peasants free use of the lands they formerly rented, since no other economic or technical basis exists, and it cannot be created at one stroke.
The implements and stock of the big farms must be confiscated without fail and converted into state property, with the absolute condition that, after the requirements of the big state farms have been met, the neighbouring small peasants may have the use of these implements gratis, in compliance with conditions drawn up by the proletarian state.
In the period immediately following the proletarian revolution, it is absolutely necessary, not only to confiscate the estates of the big landowners at once, but also to deport or to intern them all as leaders of counter-revolution and ruthless oppressors of the entire rural population. However, with the consolidation of the proletarian power in the countryside as well as in the cities, systematic efforts should be made to employ (under the special control of highly reliable communist workers) those forces within this class that possess valuable experience, know how, and organising skill, to build large-scale socialist agriculture.
7)The victory of socialism over capitalism and the consolidation of socialism may be regarded as ensured only when the proletarian state power, having completely suppressed all resistance by the exploiters and assured itself complete subordination and stability, has reorganised the whole of industry on the lines of large-scale collective production and on a modern technical basis (founded on the electrification of the entire economy). This alone will enable the cities to render such radical assistance, technical and social, to the backward and scattered rural population as will create the material basis necessary to boost the productivity of agricultural and of farm labour in general, thereby encouraging the small farmers by the force of example and in their own interests to adopt large-scale, collective and mechanised agriculture. Although nominally recognised by all socialists, this indisputable theoretical truth is in fact distorted by the opportunism prevalent in the yellow Second International and among the leaders of the German and the British “Independents”, the French Longuetists, etc. This distortion consists in attention being directed towards the relatively remote, beautiful, and rosy future; attention is deflected from the immediate tasks of the difficult practical transition and approach to that future. In practice, it consists in preaching a compromise with the bourgeoisie and a “class truce”, i.e., complete betrayal of the proletariat, which is now waging a struggle amidst the unprecedented ruin and impoverishment created everywhere by the war, and amidst the unprecedented enrichment and arrogance of a handful of millionaires resulting from that war.
It is in the countryside that a genuine possibility of a successful struggle for socialism demands, first, that all Communist parties should inculcate in the industrial proletariat a realisation of the need to make sacrifices, and be prepared to make sacrifices so as to overthrow the bourgeoisie and consolidate proletarian power—since the dictatorship of the proletariat implies both the ability of the proletariat to organise and lead all the working and exploited people, and the vanguard’s ability to make the utmost sacrifices and to display the utmost heroism to that end; second, success demands that, as a result of the workers’ victory, the labouring and most exploited masses in the countryside achieve an immediate and considerable improvement in their conditions at the expense of the exploiters—for without that the industrial proletariat cannot get the support of the rural areas and, in particular, will be unable to ensure the supply of food for the cities.
8)The enormous difficulty of organising and training for the revolutionary struggle the masses of rural working people, whom capitalism has reduced to a state of great wretchedness, disunity and frequently semi-medieval dependence, makes it necessary for the Communist parties to devote special attention to the strike strugg]e in the rural districts, give greater support to mass strikes by the agricultural proletarians and semi-proletarians, and help develop the strike movement in every way. The experience of the Russian revolutions of 1905 and of 1917, now confirmed and extended by the experience of Germany and other advanced countries, shows that the growing mass strike struggle (into which, under certain conditions, the small peasants can and should also be drawn) is alone capable of rousing the countryside from its lethargy, awakening the class-consciousness of the exploited masses in the countryside, making them realise the need for class organisation, and revealing to them in a vivid and practical manner the importance of their alliance with the urban workers.
This Congress of the Communist International brands as traitors and renegades those socialists—to be found, unfortunate]y, not only in the yellow Second International, but also in the three very important European parties which have withdrawn from that International—who are not only capable of remaining indifferent to the strike struggle in the countryside, but even (like Karl Kautsky) of opposing it on the grounds that it threatens to reduce the output of articles of consumption. Neither programmes nor the most solemn declarations are of any value whatever unless it is proved in practice, in deed, that the Communists and workers’ leaders are able to place above everything else in the world the development and the victory of the proletarian revolution, and to make the greatest sacrifices for it, for otherwise there is no way out, no salvation from starvation, ruin, and new imperialist wars.
In particular, it should be pointed out that the leaders of the old socialist movement and representatives of the “labour aristocracy”—who now often make verbal concessions to communism and even nominally side with it in order to preserve their prestige among the worker masses, which are rapidly becoming revolutionary—should be tested for their loyalty to the cause of the proletariat and their suitability for responsible positions in those spheres of work where the development of revolutionary consciousness and the revolutionary struggle is most marked, the resistance of the landowners and the bourgeoisie (the big peasants, the kulaks) most fierce, and the difference between the socialist compromiser and the communist revolutionary most striking.
9)The Communist parties must exert every effort to begin, as speedily as possible, to set up Soviets of Deputies in the countryside, and in the first place Soviets of hired labourers and semi-proletarians. Only if they are linked up with the mass strike struggle and with the most oppressed class can the Soviets perform their functions, and become consolidated enough to influence (and later to incorporate) the small peasants. If, however, the strike struggle has not yet developed, and the agricultural proletariat is as yet incapable of strong organisation owing both to the severe oppression by the landowners and the big peasants and to lack of support from the industrial workers and their unions, then the formation of Soviets of Deputies in the rural areas will require lengthy preparation by means of the organisation of communist cells, even if only small ones, intensified agitation—in which the demands of communism are enunciated in the simplest manner and illustrated by the most glaring examples of exploitation and oppression—and the arrangement of systematic visits of industrial workers to the rural districts, and so on.

      Report On The International Situation 
      And The Fundamental Tasks Of
      The Communist International 
      July 19 
    

      (An ovation breaks out. All present rise to their feet and
      applaud. The speaker tries to begin, but the applause and cries
      in all languages continue. The ovation does not abate.)
      Comrades, the theses on the questions of the fundamental tasks
      of the Communist International have been published in all
      languages and contain nothing that is materially new
      (particularly to the Russian comrades). That is because, in a
      considerable measure, they extend several of the main features
      of our revolutionary experience and the lessons of our
      revolutionary movement to a number of Western countries, to
      Western Europe. My report will therefore deal at greater length,
      if in brief outline, with the first part of my subject, namely,
      the international situation. 
Imperialism’s economic relations constitute the core of
    the entire international situation as it now exists. Throughout
    the twentieth century, this new, highest and final stage of
    capitalism has fully taken shape. Of course, you all know that the
    enormous dimensions that capital has reached are the most
    characteristic and essential feature of imperialism. The place of
    free competition has been taken by huge monopolies. An
    insignificant number of capitalists have, in some cases, been able
    to concentrate in their hands entire branches of industry; these
    have passed into the hands of combines, cartels, syndicates and
    trusts, not infrequently of an international nature. Thus, entire
    branches of industry, not only in single countries, but all over
    the world, have been taken over by monopolists in the field of
    finance, property rights, and partly of production. This has
    formed the basis for the unprecedented domination exercised by an
    insignificant number of very big banks, financial tycoons,
    financial magnates who have, in fact, transformed even the freest
    republics into financial monarchies. Before the war this was
    publicly recognised by such far from revolutionary writers as, for
    example, Lysis in France. 
This domination by a handful of capitalists achieved full
    development when the whole world had been partitioned, not only in
    the sense that the various sources of raw materials and means of
    production had been seized by the biggest capitalists, but also in
    the sense that the preliminary partition of the colonies had been
    completed. Some forty years ago, the population of the colonies
    stood at somewhat over 250,000,000, who were subordinated to six
    capitalist powers. Before the war of 1914, the population of the
    colonies was estimated at about 600,000,000, and if we add
    countries like Persia, Turkey, and China, which were already
    semi-colonies, we shall get, in round figures, a population of a
    thousand million people oppressed through colonial dependence by
    the richest, most civilised and freest countries. And you know
    that, apart from direct political and juridical dependence,
    colonial dependence presumes a number of relations of financial
    and economic dependence, a number of wars, which were not regarded
    as wars because very often they amounted to sheer massacres, when
    European and American imperialist troops, armed with the most
    up-to-date weapons of destruction, slaughtered the unarmed and
    defenceless inhabitants of colonial countries. 
The first imperialist war of 1914-18 was the inevitable outcome
    of this partition of the whole world, of this domination by the
    capitalist monopolies, of this great power wielded by an
    insignificant number of very big banks—two, three, four or
    five in each country. This war was waged for the repartitioning of
    the whole world. It was waged in order to decide which of the
    small groups of the biggest states—the British or the
    German—was to obtain the opportunity and the right to rob,
    strangle and exploit the whole world. You know that the war
    settled this question in favour of the British group. And, as a
    result of this war, all capitalist contradictions have become
    immeasurably more acute. At a single stroke the war relegated
    about 250,000,000 of the world’s inhabitants to what is
    equivalent to colonial status, viz., Russia, whose population can
    be taken at about 130,000,000, and Austria-Hungary, Germany and
    Bulgaria, with a total population of not less than
    120,000,000. That means 250,000,000 people living in countries, of
    which some, like Germany, are among the most advanced, most
    enlightened, most cultured, and on a level with modern technical
    progress. By means of the Treaty of Versailles, the war imposed
    such terms upon these countries that advanced peoples have been
    reduced to a state of colonial dependence, poverty, starvation,
    ruin, and loss of rights: this treaty binds them for many
    generations, placing them in conditions that no civilised nation
    has ever lived in. The following is the post-war picture of the
    world: at least 1, 250 million people are at
    once brought under the colonial yoke, exploited by a brutal
    capitalism, which once boasted of its love for peace, and ha~ some
    right to do so some fifty years ago, when the world was not yet
    partitioned, the monopolies did not as yet rule, and capitalism
    could still develop in a relatively peaceful way, without
    tremendous military conflicts. 
Today, after this “peaceful” period, we see a
    monstrous intensification of oppression, the reversion to a
    colonial and military oppression that is far worse than
    before. The Treaty of Versailles has placed Germany and the other
    defeated countries in a position that makes their economic
    existence physically impossible, deprives them of all rights, and
    humiliates them. 
How many nations are the beneficiaries? To answer this question
    we must recall that the population of the United States—the
    only full beneficiary from the war, a country which, from a heavy
    debtor, has become a general creditor—is no more than
    100,000,000. The population of Japan—which gained a great
    deal by keeping out of the European-American conflict and by
    seizing the enormous Asian continent—is 50,000,000. The
    population of Britain, which next to the above-mentioned countries
    gained most, is about 50,000,000. If we add the neutral countries
    with their very small populations, countries which were enriched
    by the war, we shall get, in round figures, some 250,000,000
    people. 
Thus you get the broad outlines of the picture of the world as
    it appeared after the imperialist war. In the oppressed
    colonies—countries which are being dismembered, such as
    Persia, Turkey and China, and in countries that were defeated and
    have been relegated to the position of colonies—there are
    1,250 million inhabitants. Not more than 250,000,000 inhabit
    countries that have retained their old positions, but have become
    economically dependent upon America, and all of which, during the
    war, were militarily dependent, once the war involved the whole
    world and did not permit a single state to remain really
    neutral. And, finally, we have not more than 250,000 000
    inhabitants in countries whose top stratum, the capitaiists alone,
    benefited from the partition of the world. We thus get a total of
    about 1,750 million comprising the entire population of the
    world. I would like to remind you of this picture of the world,
    for all the basic contradictions of capitalism, of imperialism,
    which are leading up to revolution, all the basic contradictions
    in the working-class movement that have led up to the furious
    struggle against the Second International, facts our chairman has
    referred to, are all connected with this partitioning of the
    world’s population. 
Of course, these figures give the economic picture of the world
    only approximately, in broad outline. And, comrades, it is naturaI
    that, with the population of the world divided in this way,
    exploitation by finance capital, the capitalist monopolies, has
    increased many times over. 
Not only have the colonial and the defeated countries been
    reduced to a state of dependence; within each victor state the
    contradictions have grown more acute; all the capitalist
    contradictions have become aggravated. I shall illustrate this
    briefly with a few examples. 
Let us take the national debts. We know that the debts of the
    principal European states increased no less than
    sevenfold in the period between 1914 and 1920. I shall
    quote another economic source, one of particular
    significance—Keynes, the British diplomat and author of
    The Economic Consequenices of the Peace, who, on
    instructions from his government, took part in the Versailles
    peace negotiations, observed them on the spot from thc purely
    bourgeois point of view, studied the subject in detail, step by
    step, and took part in the conferences as an economist. He has
    arrived at conclusions which are more weighty, more striking and
    more instructive than any a Communist revolutionary could draw,
    because they are the conclusions of a well-known bourgeois and
    implacable enemy of Bolshevism, which he, like the British
    philistine he is, imagines as something monstrous, ferocious, and
    bestial. Keynes has reached the conclusion that after the Peace of
    Versailles, Europe and the whole world are heading for
    bankruptcy. He has resigned, and thrown his book in the
    government’s face with the words: “What you are doing
    is madness”. I shall quote his figures, which can be summed
    up as follows. 
What are the debtor-creditor relations that have developed
    between the principal powers? I shall convert pounds sterling into
    gold rubles, at a rate of ten gold rubles to one pound. Here is
    what we get: the United States has assets amounting to 19,000
    million, its liabilities are nil. Before the war it was in
    Britain’s debt. In his report on April 14, 1920, to the last
    congress of the Communist Party of Germany, Comrade Levi very
    correctly pointed out that there are now only two powers in the
    world that can act independently, viz., Britain and
    America. America alone is absolutely independent
    financially. Before the war she was a debtor; she is now a
    creditor only. All the other powers in the world are
    debtors. Britain has been reduced to a position in which her
    assets total 17,000 million, and her liabilities 8,000
    million. She is already half-way to becoming a debtor
    nation. Moreover, her assets include about 6,000 million owed to
    her by Russia. Included in the debt are military supplies received
    by Russia during the war. When Krasin, as representative of the
    Russian Soviet Government, recently had occasion to discuss with
    Lloyd George the subject of debt agreements, he made it plain to
    the scientists and politicians, to the British Government’s
    leaders, that they were labouring under a strange delusion if they
    were counting on getting these debts repaid. The British diplomat
    Keynes has already laid this delusion bare. 
Of course, it is not only or even not at all a question of the
    Russian revolutionary government having no wish to pay the
    debts. No government would pay, because these debts are usurious
    interest on a sum that has been paid twenty times over, and the
    selfsame bourgeois Keynes, who does not in the least sympathise
    with the Russian revolutionary movement, says: “It is clear
    that these debts cannot be taken into account.” 
In regard to France, Keynes quotes the following figures: her
    assets amount to 3,500 million, and her liabilities to 10,500
    million! And this is a country which the French themselves called
    the world’s money-lender, because her “savings”
    were enormous; the proceeds of colonial and financial
    pillage—a gigantic capital—enabled her to grant
    thousands upon thousands of millions in loans, particularly to
    Russia. These loans brought in an enormous
    revenue. Notwithstanding this and notwithstanding victory, France
    has been reduced to debtor status. 
A bourgeois American source, quoted by Comrade Braun, a
    Communist, in his book Who Must Pay the War Debts?
    (Leipzig, 1920), estimates the ratio of debts to national wealth
    as follows: in the victor countries, Britain and Francc, the ratio
    of debts to aggregate national wealth is over 50 per cent; in
    Italy the percentage is between 60 and 70, and in Russia 90. As
    you know, however, these debts do not disturb us, because we
    followed Keynes’s excellent advice just a little before his
    book appeared—we annulled all our debts. (Stormy
    applause.) 
In this, however, Keynes reveals the usual crankiness of the
    philistine: while advising that all debts should be annulled, he
    goes on to say that, of course, France only stands to gain by it,
    that, of course, Britain will not lose very much, as nothing can
    be got out of Russia in any case; America will lose a fair amount,
    but Keynes counts on American “generosity”! On this
    point our views differ from those of Keynes and other
    petty-bourgeois pacifists. We think that to get the debts annulled
    they will have to wait for something else to happen, and will have
    to try working in a direction other than counting on the
    “generosity” of the capitalists. 
These few figures go to show that the imperialist war has
    created an impossible situation for the victor powers as
    well. This is further shown by the enormous disparity between
    wages and price rises. On March 8 of this year, the Supreme
    Economic Council, an institution charged with protecting the
    bourgeois system throughout the world from the mounting
    revolution, adopted a resolution which ended with an appeal for
    order, industry and thrift, provided, of course, the workers
    remain the slaves of capital. This Supreme Economic Council, organ
    of the Entente and of the capitalists of the whole world,
    presented the following summary. 
In the United States of America food prices have risen, on the
    average, by 120 per cent, whereas wages have increased only by 100
    per cent. In Britain, food prices have gone up by 170 per cent,
    and wages 130 per cent; in France, food prices—300 per
    cent,. and wages 200 per cent; in Japan—food prices 130 per
    cent, and wages 60 per cent (I have analysed Comrade Braun’s
    figures in his pamphlet and those of the Supreme Economic Council
    as published in The Times of March 10, 1920). 
In such circumstances, the workers’ mounting resentment,
    the growth of a revolutionary temper and ideas, and the increase
    in spontaneous mass strikes are obviously inevitable, since the
    position of the workers is becoming intolerable. The
    workers’ own experience is convincing them that the
    capitalists have become prodigiously enriched by the war and are
    placing the burden of war costs and debts upon the workers’
    shoulders. We recently learnt by cable that America wants to
    deport another 500 Communists to Russia so as to get rid of
    “dangerous agitators”. 
Even if America deports to our country, not 500 but 500,000
    Russian, American, Japanese and French “agitators”
    that will make no difference, because there will still be the
    disparity between prices and wages, which they can do nothing
    about. The reason why they can do nothing about it is because
    private property is most strictly safeguarded, is
    “sacred” there. That should not be forgotten, because
    it is only in Russia that the exploiters’ private property
    has been abolished. The capitalists can do nothing about the gap
    between prices and wages, and the workers cannot live on their
    previous wages. The old methods are useless against this
    calamity. Nothing can be achieved by isolated strikes, the
    parliamentary struggle, or the vote, because “private
    property is sacred”, and the capitalists have accumulated
    such debts that the whole world is in bondage to a handful of
    men. Meanwhile the workers’ living conditions are becoming
    more and more unbearable. There is no other way out but to abolish
    the exploiters’ “private property”. 
In his pamphlet Britain and the World Revolution,
    valuable extracts from which were published by our Bulletin of
    the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Affairs of
    February 1920, Comrade Lapinsky points out that in Britain coal
    export prices have doubled as against those anticipated by
    official industrial circles. 
In Lancashire things have gone so far that shares are at a
    premium of 400 per cent. Bank profits are at least 40-50 per
    cent. It should, moreover, be noted that, in determining bank
    profits, all bank officials are able to conceal the lion’s
    share of profits by calling them, not profits but bonuses,
    commissions, etc. So here, too, indisputable economic facts prove
    that the wealth of a tiny handful of people has grown prodigiously
    and that their luxury beggars description, while the poverty of
    the working class is steadily growing. We must particularly note
    the further circumstance brought out very clearly by Comrade Levi
    in the report I have just referred to, namely, the change in the
    value of money. Money has everywhere depreciated as a result of
    the debts, the issue of paper currency, etc. The same bourgeois
    source I have already mentioned, namely, the statement of the
    Supreme Economic Council of March 8, 1920, has calculated that in
    Britain the depreciation in the value of currency as against the
    dollar is approximately one-third, in France and Italy two-thirds,
    and in Germany as much as 96 per cent. 
This fact shows that the “mechanism” of the world
    capitalist economy is falling apart. The trade relations on which
    the acquisition of raw materials and the sale of commodities hinge
    under capitalism cannot go on; they cannot continue to be based on
    the subordination of a number of countries to a single
    country—the reason being the change in the value of
    money. No wealthy country can exist or trade unless it sells its
    goods and obtains raw materials. 
Thus we have a situation in which America, a wealthy country
    that all countries are subordinate to, cannot buy or sell. And the
    selfsame Keynes who went through the entire gamut of the
    Versailles negotiations has been compelled to acknowledge this
    impossibility despite his unyielding determination to defend
    capitalism, and all his hatred of Bolshevism. Incidentally, I do
    not think any communist manifesto, or one that is revolutionary in
    general, could compare in forcefulness with those pages in
    Keynes’s book which depict Wilson and
    “Wilsonism” in action. Wilson was the idol of
    philistines and pacifists like Keynes and a number of heroes of
    the Second International (and even of the
    “Two-and-a-Half” International[2]), who
    exalted the “Fourteen Points” and even wrote
    “learned” books about the “roots “ of
    Wilson ’s policy; they hoped that Wilson would save
    “social peace”, reconcile exploiters and exploited,
    and bring about social reforms. Keynes showed vividly how Wilson
    was made a fool of, and all these illusions were shattered at the
    first impact with the practical, mercantile and huckster policy of
    capital as personified by Clemenceau and Lloyd George. The masses
    of the workers now see more clearly than ever, from their own
    experience—and the learned pedants could see it just by
    reading Keynes’s book—that the “roots” of
    Wilson’s policy lay in sanctimonious piffle, petty-bourgeois
    phrase-mongering, and an utter inability to understand the class
    struggle. 
In consequence of all this, two conditions, two fundamental
    situations, have inevitably and naturally emerged. On the one
    hand, the impoverishment of the masses has grown incredibly,
    primarily among 1,250 million people, i.e., 70 per cent of the
    world’s population. These are the colonial and dependent
    countries whose inhabitants possess no legal rights, countries
    “mandated” to the brigands of finance. Besides, the
    enslavement of the defeated countries has been sanctioned by the
    Treaty of Versailles and by existing secret treaties regarding
    Russia, whose validity, it is true, is sometimes about as real as
    that of the scraps of paper stating that we owe so many thousands
    of millions. For the first time in world history, we see robbery,
    slavery, dependence, poverty and starvation imposed upon 1,250
    million people by a legal act. 
On the other hand, the workers in each of the creditor
    countries have found themselves in conditions that are
    intolerable. The war has led to an unprecedented aggravation of
    all capitalist contradictions, this being the origin of the
    intense revolutionary ferment that is ever growing. During the war
    people were put under military discipline, hurled into the ranks
    of death, or threatened with immediate wartime punishment. Because
    of the war conditions people could not see the economic
    realities. Writers, poets, the clergy, the whole press were
    engaged in nothing but glorifying the war. Now that the war has
    ended, the exposures have begun: German imperialism with its Peace
    of Brest-Litovsk has been laid bare; the Treaty of Versailles,
    which was to have been a victory for imperialism but proved its
    defeat, has been exposed. Incidentally, the example of Keynes
    shows that in Europe and America tens and hundreds of thousands of
    petty-bourgeois, intellectuals, and simply more or less literate
    and educated people, have had to follow the road taken by Keynes,
    who resigned and threw in the face of the government a book
    exposing it. Keynes has shown what is taking place and will take
    place in the minds of thousands and hundreds of thousands of
    people when they realise that all the speeches about a “war
    for liberty”, etc., were sheer deception, and that as a
    result only a handful of people were enriched, while the others
    were ruined and reduced to slavery. Is it not a fact that the
    bourgeois Keynes declares that, to survive and save the British
    economy, the British must secure the resumption of free commercial
    intercourse between Germany and Russia? How can this be achieved?
    By cancelling all debts, as Keynes proposes. This is an idea that
    has been arrived at not only by Keynes, the learned economist;
    millions of people are or will be getting the same idea. And
    millions of people hear bourgeois economists declare that there is
    no way out except annulling the debts; therefore “damn the
    Bolsheviks” (who have annulled the debts), and let us appeal
    to America’s “generosity”! I think that, on
    behalf of the Congress of the Communist International, we should
    send a message of thanks to these economists, who have been
    agitating for Bolshevism. 
If, on the one hand, the economic position of the masses has
    become intolerable, and, on the other hand, the disintegration
    described by Keynes has set in and is growing among the negligible
    minority of all-powerful victor countries, then we are in the
    presence of the maturing of the two conditions for the world
    revolution. 
We now have before us a somewhat more complete picture of the
    whole world. We know what dependence upon a handful of rich men
    means to 1,250 million people who have been placed in intolerable
    conditions of existence. On the other hand, when the peoples were
    presented with the League of Nations Covenant, declaring that the
    League had put an end to war and would henceforth not permit
    anyone to break the peace, and when this Covenant, the last hope
    of working people all over the world, came into force, it proved
    to be a victory of the first order for us. Before it came into
    force, people used to say that it was impossible not to impose
    special conditions on a country like Germany, but when the
    Covenant was drawn up, everything would come out all right. Yet,
    when the Covenant was published, the bitterest opponents of
    Bolshevism were obliged to repudiate it. When the Covenant came
    into operation, it appeared that a small group of the richest
    countries, the “Big Four"—in the persons of
    Clemenceau, Lloyd George, Orlando and Wilson—had been put on
    the job of creating the new relations! When the machinery of the
    Covenant was put into operation, this led to a complete
    breakdown. 
We saw this in the case of the wars against Russia. Weak,
    ruined and crushed, Russia, a most backward country, fought
    against all the nations, against a league of the rich and powerful
    states that dominate the world, and emerged victorious. We could
    not put up a force that was anything like the equal of theirs, and
    yet we proved the victors. Why was that? Because there was not a
    jot of unity among them, because each power worked against the
    other. France wanted Russia to pay her debts and become a
    formidable force against Germany; Britain wanted to partition
    Russia, and attempted to seize the Baku oilfields and conclude a
    treaty with the border states of Russia. Among the official
    British documents there is a Paper which scrupulously enumerates
    all the states (fourteen in all) which some six months ago, in
    December 1919, pledged themselves to take Moscow and
    Petrograd. Britain based her policy on these states, to whom she
    granted loans running into millions. All these calculations have
    now misfired, and all the loans are unrecoverable. 
Such is the situation created by the League of Nations. Every
    day of this Covenant’s existence provides the best
    propaganda for Bolshevism, since the most powerful adherents of
    the capitalist “order” are revealing that, on every
    question, they put spokes in one another’s wheels. Furious
    wrangling over the partitioning of Turkey, Persia, Mesopotamia and
    China is going on between Japan, Britain, America and France. The
    bourgeois press in these countries is full of the bitterest
    attacks and the angriest statements against their
    “colleagues” for trying to snatch the booty from under
    their noses. We see complete discord at the top, among this
    handful, this very small number of extremely rich countries. There
    are 1,250 million people who find it impossible to live in the
    conditions of servitude which “advanced” and civilised
    capitalism wishes to impose on them: after all, these represent 70
    per cent of the world’s population. This handful of the
    richest states—Britain, America and Japan (though Japan was
    able to plunder the Eastern, the Asian countries, she cannot
    constitute an independent financial and military force without
    support from another country)—these two or three countries
    are unable to organise economic relations, and are directing their
    policies toward disrupting policies of their colleagues and
    partners in the League of Nations. Hence the world crisis; it is
    these economic roots of the crisis that provide the chief reason
    of the brilliant successes the Communist International is
    achieving. 
Comrades, we have now come to the question of the revolutionary
    crisis as the basis of our revolutionary action. And here we must
    first of all note two widespread errors. On the one hand,
    bourgeois economists depict this crisis simply as
    “unrest”, to use the elegant expression of the
    British. On the other hand, revolutionaries sometimes try to prove
    that the crisis is absolutely insoluble. 
 This is a mistake. There is no such thing as an absolutely
    hopeless situation. The bourgeoisie are behaving like barefaced
    plunderers who have lost their heads; they are committing folly
    after folly, thus aggravating the situation and hastening their
    doom. All that is true. But nobody can “prove” that it
    is absolutely impossible for them to pacify a minority of the
    exploited with some petty concessions, and suppress some movement
    or uprising of some section of the oppressed and exploited. To try
    to “prove” in advance that there is
    “absolutely” no way out of the situation would be
    sheer pedantry, or playing with concepts and catchwords. Practice
    alone can serve as real “proof” in this and similar
    questions. All over the world, the bourgeois system is
    experiencing a tremendous revolutionary crisis. The revolutionary
    parties must now “prove” in practice that they have
    sufficient understanding and organisation, contact with the
    exploited masses, and determination and skill to utilise this
    crisis for a successful, a victorious revolution. 
It is mainly to prepare this “proof” that we have
    gathered at this Congress of the Communist International. 
To illustrate to what extent opportunism still prevails among
    parties that wish to affiliate to the Third International, and how
    far the work of some parties is removed from preparing the
    revolutionary class to utilise the revolution ary crisis, I shall
    quote the leader of the British Independent Labour Party, Ramsay
    MacDonald. In his book, Parliament and Revolution, which
    deals with the basic problems that are now engaging our attention,
    MacDonald describes the state of affairs in what is something like
    a bourgeois pacifist spirit. He admits that there is a
    revolutionary crisis and that revolutionary sentiments are
    growing, that the sympathies of the workers are with the Soviets
    and the dictatorship of the proletariat (note that this refers to
    Britain) and that the dictatorship of the proletariat is better
    than the present dictatorship of the British bourgeoisie. 
But MacDonald remains a thorough-paced bourgeois pacifist and
    compromiser, a petty bourgeois who dreams of a government that
    stands above classes. Like all bourgeois liars, sophists and
    pedants, MacDonald recognises the class struggle merely as a
    “descriptive fact”. He ignores the experience of
    Kerensky, the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries of
    Russia, the similar experience of Hungary, Germany, etc., in
    regard to creating a “democratic” government allegedly
    standing above classes. MacDonald lulls his party and those
    workers who have the misfortune to regard this bourgeois as a
    socialist, this philistine as a leader, with the words: “We
    know that all this [i.e., the revolutionary crisis, the
    revolutionary ferment] will pass . . . settle down.” The
    war, he says, inevitably provoked the crisis, but after the war it
    will all “settle down”, even if not at once! 
That is what has been written by a man who is leader of a party
    that wants to affiliate to the Third International. This is a
    revelation—the more valuable for its rare
    outspokenness—of what is no less frequently to be seen in
    the top ranks of the French Socialist Party and the German
    Independent Social-Democratic Party, namely, not merely an
    inability, but also an unwillingness to take advantage, in a
    revolutionary sense, of the revolutionary crisis, or, in other
    words, both an inability and an unwillingness to really prepare
    the party and the class in revolutionary fashion for the
    dictatorship of the proletariat. 
That is the main evil in very many parties which are now
    leaving the Second International. This is precisely why, in the
    theses I have submitted to the present Congress, I have dwelt most
    of all on the tasks connected with preparations for the
    dictatorship of the proletariat, and have given as concrete and
    exact a definition of them as possible. 
Here is another example. A new book against Bolshevism was
    recently published. An unusually large number of books of this,
    kind are now coming out in Europe and America; the more
    anti-Bolshevik books are brought out, the more strong ly and
    rapidly mass sympathy for Bolshevism grows. I am referring to Otto
    Bauer’s Bolshevism or Social-Democracy? This book
    clearly demonstrates to the Germans the essence of Menshevism,
    whose shameful role in the Russian revolution is understood well
    enough by the workers of all countries. Otto Bauer has produced a
    thoroughgoing Menshevik pamphlet, although he has concealed his
    own sympathy with Menshevism. In Europe and America, however, more
    precise information should now be disseminated about what
    Menshevism actually is, for it is a generic term for all allegedly
    socialist, Social-Democratic and other trends that are hostile to
    Bolshevism. It would be dull writing if we Russians were to
    explain to Europeans what Menshevism is. Otto Bauer has shown that
    in his book, and we thank in advance the bourgeois and opportunist
    publishers who will publish it and translate it into various
    languages. Bauer’s book will be a useful if peculiar
    supplement to the textbooks on communism. Take any paragraph, any
    argument in Otto Bauer’s book and indicate the Menshevism in
    it, where the roots lie of views that lead up to the actions of
    the traitors to socialism, of the friends of Kerensky,
    Scheidemann, etc.—this is a question that could be very
    usefully and successfully set in “examinations”
    designed to test whether communism has been properly
    assimilated. If you cannot answer this question, you are not yet a
    Communist, and should not join the Communist
    Party. (Applause.) 
Otto Bauer has excellently expressed in a single sentence the
    essence of the views of world opportunism; for this, if we could
    do as we please in Vienna, we would put up a monument to him in
    his lifetime. The use of force in the class struggle in modern
    democracies, Otto Bauer says, would be “violence exercised
    against the social factors of force”. 
You may think that this sounds queer and unintelligible. It is
    an example of what Marxism has been reduced to, of the kind of
    banality and defence of the exploiters to which the most
    revolutionary theory can be reduced. A German variety of
    philistinism is required, and you get the “theory”
    that the “social factors of force” are: number; the
    degree of organisation; the place held in the process of
    production and distribution; activity and education. If a rural
    agricultural labourer or an urban working man practices
    revolutionary violence against a landowner or a capitalist, that
    is no dictatorship of the proletarlat, no violence against the
    exploiters and the oppressors of the people. Oh, no! This is
    “violence against the social factors of force”. 
 Perhaps my example sounds something like a jest. However, such
    is the nature of present-day opportunism that its struggle against
    Bolshevism becomes a jest. The task of involving the working
    class, all its thinking elements, in the struggle hetween
    international Menshevism (the MacDonalds, Otto Bauers and Co.) and
    Bolshevism is highly useful and very urgent to Europe and
    America. 
Here we must ask: how is the persistence of such trends in
    Europe to be explained? Why is this opportunism stronger in
    Western Europe than in our country? It is because the culture of
    the advanced countries has been, and still is, the result of their
    being able to live at the expense of a thousand million oppressed
    people. It is because the capitalists of these countries obtain a
    great deal more in this way than they could obtain as profits by
    plundering the workers in their own countries. 
Before the war, it was calculated that the three richest
    countries—Britain, France and Germany—got between
    eight and ten thousand million francs a year from the export of
    capital alone, apart from other sources. 
It goes without saying that, out of this tidy sum, at least
    five hundred millions can be spent as a sop to the labour leaders
    and the labour aristocracy, i.e., on all sorts of bribes. The
    whole thing boils down to nothing but bribery. It is done in a
    thousand different ways: by increasing cultural facilities in the
    largest centres, by creating educational institutions, and by
    providing co-operative, trade union and parliamentary leaders with
    thousands of cushy jobs. This is done wherever present-day
    civilised capitalist relations exist. It is these thousands of
    millions in super-profits that form the economic basis of
    opportunism in the working-class movement. In America, Britain and
    France we see a far greater persistence of the opportunist
    leaders, of the upper crust of the working class, the labour
    aristocracy; they offer stronger resistance to the Communist
    movement. That is why we must be prepared to find it harder for
    the European and American workers’ parties to get rid of
    this disease than was the case in our country. We know that
    enormous successes have been achieved in the treatment of this
    disease since the Third International was formed, but we have not
    yet finished the job; the purg- ing of the workers’ parties,
    the revolutionary parties of the proletariat all over the world,
    of bourgeois influences, of the opportunists in their ranks, is
    very far from complete. 
I shall not dwell on the concrete manner in which we must do
    that; that is dealt with in my published theses. My task consists
    in indicating the deep economic roots of this phenomenon. The
    disease is a protracted one; the cure takes longer than the
    optimists hoped it-would. Opportunism is our principal
    enemy. Opportunism in the upper ranks of the working-class
    movement is bourgeois socialism, not proletarian socialism. It has
    been shown in practice that working-class activists who follow the
    opportunist trend are better defenders of the bourgeoisie than the
    bourgeois themselves. Without their leadership of the workers, the
    bourgeoisie could not remain in power. This has been proved, not
    only by the history of the Kerensky regime in Russia; it has also
    been proved by the democratic republic in Germany under its
    Social-Democratic government, as well as by Albert Thomas’s
    attitude towards his bourgeois government. It has been proved by
    similar experience in Britain and the United States. This is where
    our principal enemy is, an enemy we must overcome. We must leave
    this Congress firmly resolved to carry on this struggle to the
    very end, in all parties. That is our main task. 
Compared with this task, the rectification of the errors of the
    “Left” trend in communism will be an easy one. In a
    number of countries anti-parliamentarianism is to be seen, which
    has not been so much introduced by people of petty-bourgeois
    origin as fostered by certain advanced contingents of the
    proletariat out of hatred for the old parliamentarianism, out of a
    legitimate, proper and necessary hatred for the conduct of members
    of parliament in Britain, France, Italy, in all lands. Directives
    must be issued by the Communist International and the comrades
    must be made more familiar with the experience of Russia, with the
    significance of a genuinely proletarian political party. Our work
    will consist in accomplishing this task. The fight against these
    errors in the proletarian movement, against these shortcomings,
    will be a thousand times easier than fighting against those
    bourgeois who, in the guise of reformists, belong to the old
    parties of the Second International and conduct the whole of their
    work in a bourgeois, not proletarian, spirit.
 Comrades, in conclusion I shall deal with one other aspect of
    the subject. Our comrade, the chairman, has said that our Congress
    merits the title of a World Congress. I think he is right,
    particularly because we have here quite a number of
    representatives of the revolutionary movement in the colonial and
    backward countries. This is only a small beginning, but the
    important thing is that a beginning has been made. At this
    Congress we see taking place a union between revolutionary
    proletarians of the capitalist, advanced countries, and the
    revolutionary masses of those countries where there is no or
    hardly any proletariat, i.e., the oppressed masses of colonial,
    Eastern countries. It is on ourselves that the consolidation of
    unity depends, and I am sure we shall achieve it. World
    imperialism shall fall when the revolutionary onslaught of the
    exploited and oppressed workers in each country, overcoming
    resistance from petty-bourgeois elements and the influence of the
    small upper crust of labour aristocrats, merges with the
    revolutionary onslaught of hundreds of millions of people who have
    hitherto stood beyond the pale of history, and have been regarded
    merely as the object of history. 
The imperialist war has helped the revolution: from the
    colonies, the backward countries, and the isolation they lived in,
    the bourgeoisie levied soldiers for this imperialist war. The
    British bourgeoisie impressed on the soldiers from India that it
    was the duty of the Indian peasants to defend Great Britain
    against Germany; the French bourgeoisie impressed on soldiers from
    the French colonies that it was their duty to defend France. They
    taught them the use of arms, a very useful thing, for which we
    might express our deep gratitude to the bourgeoisie—express
    our gratitude on behalf of all the Russian workers and peasants,
    and particularly on behalf of all the Russian Red Army. The
    imperialist war has drawn the dependent peoples into world
    history. And one of the most important tasks now confronting us is
    to consider how the foundation-stone of the organisation of the
    Soviet movement Can be laid in the non-capitalist
    countries. Soviets are possible there; they will not be
    workers’ Soviets, but peasants’ Soviets, or Soviets of
    working people. 
Much work will have to be done; errors will be inevitable; many
    difficulties will be encountered along this road. It is the
    fundamental task of the Second Congress to elaborate or indicate
    the practical principles that will enable the work, till now
    carried on in an unorganised fashion among hundreds of millions of
    people, to be carried on in an organised, coherent and systematic
    fashion. 
Now, a year or a little more after the First Congress of the
    Communist International, we have emerged victors over the Second
    International; it is not only among the workers of the civilised
    countries that the ideas of the Soviets have spread; it is not
    only to them that they have become known and intelligible. The
    warkers of all lands are ridiculing the wiseacres, not a few of
    whom call themselves socialists and argue in a learned or almost
    learned manner about the Soviet “system”, as the
    German systematists are fond of calling it, or the Soviet
    “idea” as the British Guild Socialists[3] call
    it. Not infrequently, these arguments about the Soviet
    “system” or “idea” becloud the
    workers’ eyes and their minds. However, the workers are
    brushing this pedantic rubbish aside and are taking up the weapon
    provided by the Soviets. A recognition of the role and
    significance of the Soviets has now also spread to the lands of
    the East. 
The groundwork has been laid for the Soviet movement all over
    the East, all over Asia, among all the colonial peoples. 
The proposition that the exploited must rise up against the
    exploiters and establish their Soviets is not a very complex
    one. After our experience, after two and a half years of the
    existence of the Soviet Republic in Russia, and after the First
    Congress of the Third International, this idea is becoming
    accessible to hundreds of millions of people oppressed by the
    exploiters all over the world. We in Russia are often obliged to
    compromise, to bide our time, since we are weaker than the
    international imperialists, yet we know that we are defending the
    interests of this mass of a thousand and a quarter million
    people. For the time being, we are hampered by barriers,
    prejudices and ignorance which are receding into the past with
    every passing hour; but we are more and more becoming
    representatives and genuine defenders of this 70 per cent of the
    world’s population, this mass of working and exploited
    people. It is with pride that we can say: at the First Congress we
    were in fact merely propagandists; we were only spreading the
    fundamental ideas among tbe world’s proletariat; we only
    issued the call for struggle; we were merely asking where the
    people were who were capable of taking this path. Today the
    advanced proletariat is everywhere with us. A proletarian army
    exists everywhere, although sometimes it is poorly organised and
    needs reorganising. If our comrades in all lands help us now to
    organise a united army, no shortcomings will prevent us from
    accomplishing our task. That task is the world proletarian
    revolution, the creation of a world Soviet
    republic. (Prolonged applause.)

Speech On The Role Of The Communist Party 
      July 23
 Comrades, I would like to make a few remarks concerning the
    speeches of Comrades Tanner and McLaine. Tanner says that he
    stands for the dictatorship of the proletariat, but he does not
    see the dictatorship of the proletariat quite in the way we do. He
    says that by the dictatorship of the proletariat we actualiy mean
    the dictatorship of the organised and class-conscious minority of
    the proletariat. 
True enough, in the era of capitalism, when the masses of the
    workers are subjected to constant exploitation and cannot develop
    their human capacities, the most characteristic feature of
    working-class political parties is that they can involve only a
    minority of their class. A political party can comprise only a
    minority of a class, in the same way as the really class-conscious
    workers in any capitalist society constitute only a minority of
    all workers. We are therefore obliged to recognise that it is only
    this class-conscious minority that can direct and lead the broad
    masses of the workers. And if Comrade Tanner says that he is
    opposed to parties, but at the same time is in favour of a
    minority that represents the best organised and most revolutionary
    workers showing the way to the entire proletariat, then I say that
    there is really no difference between us. What is this organised
    minority? If this minority is really class-conscious, if it is
    able to lead the masses, if it is able to reply to every question
    that appears on the order of the day, then it is a party in
    reality. But if comrades like Tanner, to whom we pay special heed
    as representatives of a mass movement—which cannot, without
    a certain exaggeration, be said of the representatives of the
    British Socialist Party—if these comrades are in favour of
    there being a minority that will fight resolutely for the
    dictatorship of the proletariat and will educate the masses of the
    workers along these lines, then this minority is in reality
    nothing but a party. Comrade Tanner says that this minority should
    organise and lead the entire mass of workers. If Comrade Tanner
    and the other comrades of the Shop Stewards’ group and the
    Industrial Workers of the World accept this—and we see from
    the daily talks we have had with them that they do accept
    it—if they approve the idea that the class-conscious
    Communist minority of the working class leads the proletariat,
    then they must also agree that this is exactly the meaning of all
    our resolutions. In that case the only difference between us lies
    in their avoidance of the word “party” because there
    exists among the British comrades a certain mistrust of political
    parties. They can conceive of political parties only in the image
    of the parties of Gompers and Henderson,[4] parties of
    parliamentary smart dealers and traitors to the working class. But
    if, by parliamentarianism, they mean what exists in Britain and
    America today, then we too are opposed to such parliamentarianism
    and to such political parties. What we want is new and different
    parties. We want parties that will be in constant and real contact
    with the masses and will be able to lead those masses. 
I now come to the third question I want to touch upon in
    connection with Comrade McLaine ’s speech. He is in favour
    of the British Communist Party affiliating to the Labour Party. I
    have already expressed my opinion on this score in my theses on
    affiliation to the Third International.[5] In my pamphlet I left
    the question open.[6] However, after discussing the matter
    with a number of comrades, I have come to the conclusion that the
    decision to remain within the Labour Party is the only correct
    tactic. But here is Comrade Tanner, who declares,
    “Don’t be too dogmatic.” I consider his remark
    quite out of place here. Comrade Ramsay says: “Please let us
    British Communists decide this question for ourselves.” What
    would the International be like if every little group were to come
    along and say: “Some of us are in favour of this thing and
    some are against; leave it to us to decide the matter for
    ourselves"? What then would be the use of having an International,
    a congress, and all this discussion? Comrade McLaine spoke only of
    the role of a political party. But the same applies to the trade
    unions and to parliamentarianism. It is quite true that a larger
    section of the finest revolutionaries are against affiliation to
    the Labour Party because they are opposed to parliamentarianism as
    a means of struggle. Perhaps it would be best to refer this
    question to a commission, where it should be discussed and
    studied, and then decided at this very Congress of the Communist
    International. We cannot agree that it concerns only the British
    Communists. We must say, in general, which are the correct
    tactics. 
I will now deal with some of Comrade McLaine’s arguments
    concerning the question of the British Labour Party. We must say
    frankly that the Party of Communists can join the Labour Party
    only on condition that it preserves full freedom of criticism and
    is able to conduct its own policy. This is of supreme
    importance. When, in this connection Comrade Serrati speaks of
    class collaboration, I affirm that this will not be class
    collaboration. When the Italian comrades tolerate, in their party,
    opportunists like Turati and Co., i.e., bourgeois elements, that
    is indeed class collaboration. In this instance, however, with
    regard to the British Labour Party, it is simply a matter of
    collaboration between the advanced minority of the British workers
    and their vast majority. Members of the Labour Party are all
    members of trade unions. It has a very unusual structure, to be
    found in no other country. It is an organisation that embraces
    four million workers out of the six or seven million organised in
    trade unions. They are not asked to state what their political
    opinions are. Let Comrade Serrati prove to me that anyone there
    will prevent us from exercising our right of criticism. Only by
    proving that, will you prove Comrade McLaine wrong. The British
    Socialist Party can quite freely call Henderson a traitor and yet
    remain in the Labour Party. Here we have collaboration between the
    vanguard of the working class and the rearguard, the backward
    workers. This collaboration is so important to the entire movement
    that we categorically insist on the British Communists serving as
    a link between the Party, that is, the minority of the working
    class, and the rest of the workers. If the minority is unable to
    lead the masses and establish close links with them, then it is
    not a party, and is worthless in general, even if it calls itself
    a party or the National Shop Stewards’ Committee—as
    far as I know, the Shop Stewards’ Committees in Britain have
    a National Committee, a central body, and that is a step towards a
    party. Consequently, until it is refuted that the British Labour
    Party consists of proletarians, this is co-operation between the
    vanguard of the working class and the backward workers; if this
    co-operation is not carried on systematically, the Communist Party
    will be worthless and there can be no question of the dictatorship
    of the proletariat at all. If our Italian comrades cannot produce
    more convincing arguments, we shall have to definitely settle the
    question later here, on the basis of what we know—and we
    shall come to the conclusion that affiliation is the correct
    tactic. 
Comrades Tanner and Ramsay tell us that the majority of British
    Communists will not accept affiliation. But must we always agree
    with the majority? Not at all. If they have not yet understood
    which are the correct tactics, then perhaps it would be better to
    wait. Even the parallel existence for a time of two parties would
    be better than refusing to reply to the question as to which
    tactics are correct. Of course, acting on the experience of all
    Congress delegates and on the arguments that have been brought
    forward here, you will not insist on passing a resolution here and
    now, calling for the immediate formation of a single Communist
    Party in each country. That is impossible. But we can frankly
    express our opinion, and give directives. We must study in a
    special commission the question raised by the British delegation
    and then we shall say: affiliation to the Labour Party is the
    correct tactic. If the majority is against it, we must organise a
    separate minority. That will be of educational value. If the
    masses of the British workers still believe in the old tactics, we
    shall verify our conclusions at the next congress. We cannot,
    however, say that this question concerns Britain alone—that
    would mean copying the worst habits of the Second
    International. We must express our opinion frankly. If the British
    Communists do not reach agreement, and if a mass party is not
    formed, a split is inevitable one way or another.[6b]


3
 Report Of The Commission On The National 
      and The Colonial Questions 
Comrades, I shall confine myself to a brief introduction, after
    which Comrade Maring, who has been secretary to our commission,
    will give you a detailed account of the changes we have made in
    the theses. He will be followed by Comrade Roy, who has formulated
    the supplementary theses. Our commission have unanimously adopted
    both the preliminary theses, as amended, and the supplementary
    theses. We have thus reached complete unanimity on all major
    issues. I shall now make a few brief remarks. 
First, what is the cardinal idea underlying our theses? It is
    the distinction between oppressed and oppressor nations. Unlike
    the Second International and bourgeois democracy, we emphasise
    this distinction. In this age of imperialism, it is particularly
    important for the proletariat and the Communist International to
    establish the concrete economic facts and to proceed from concrete
    realities, not from abstract postulates, in all colonial and
    national problems. 
The characteristic feature of imperialism consists in the whole
    world, as we now see, being divided into a large number of
    oppressed nations and an insignificant number of oppressor
    nations, the latter possessing colossal wealth and powerful armed
    forces. The vast majority of the world’s population, over a
    thousand million, perhaps even 1,250 million people, if we take
    the total population of the world as 1,750 million, in other
    words, about 70 per cent of the world’s population, belong
    to the oppressed nations, which are either in a state of direct
    colonial dependence or are semi-colonies, as, for example, Persia,
    Turkey and China, or else, conquered by some big imperialist
    power, have become greatly dependent on that power by virtue of
    peace treaties. This idea of distinction, of dividing the nations
    into oppressor and oppressed, runs through the theses, not only
    the first theses published earlier over my signature, but also
    those submitted by Comrade Roy. The latter were framed chiefly
    from the standpoint of the situation in India and other big Asian
    countries oppressed by Britain. Herein lies their great importance
    to us. 
The second basic idea in our theses is that, in the present
    world situation following the imperialist war, reciprocal
    relations between peoples and the world political system as a
    whole are determined by the struggle waged by a small group of
    imperialist nations against the Soviet movement and the Soviet
    states headed by Soviet Russia. Unless we bear that in mind, we
    shall not be able to pose a single national or colonial problem
    correctly, even if it concerns a most outlying part of the
    world. The Communist parties, in civilised and backward countries
    alike, can pose and solve political problems correctly only if
    they make this postulate their starting-point. 
Third, I should like especially to emphasise the question of
    the bourgeois-democratic movement in backward countries. This is a
    question that has given rise to certain differences. We have
    discussed whether it would be right or wrong, in principle and in
    theory, to state that the Communist International and the
    Communist parties must support the bourgeois-democratic movement
    in backward countries. As a result of our discussion, we have
    arrived at the unanimous decision to speak of the
    national-revolutionary movement rather than of the
    “bourgeois-democratic” movement. It is beyond doubt
    that any national movement can only be a bourgeois-democratic
    movement, since the overwhelming mass of the population in the
    backward countries consist of peasants who represent
    bourgeois-capitalist relationships. It would be utopian to believe
    that proletarian parties in these backward countries, if indeed
    they can emerge in them, can pursue communist tactics and a
    communist policy, without establishing definite relations with the
    peasant movement and without giving it effective support. However,
    the objections have been raised that, if we speak of the
    bourgeois-democratic movement, we shall be obliterating all
    distinctions between the reformist and the revolutionary
    movements. Yet that distinction has been very clearly revealed of
    late in the backward and colonial countries, since the imperialist
    bourgeoisie is doing everything in its power to implant a
    reformist movement among the oppressed nations too. There has been
    a certain rapprochement between the bourgeoisie of the
    exploiting countries and that of the colonies, so that very
    often—perhaps even in most cases—the bourgeoisie of
    the oppressed countries, while it does support the national
    movement, is in full accord with the imperialist bourgeoisie,
    i.e., joins forces with it against all revolutionary movements and
    revolutionary classes. This was irrefutably proved in the
    commission, and we decided that the only correct attitude was to
    take this distinction into account and, in nearly all cases,
    substitute the term “national-revolutionary” for the
    term “bourgeois-democratic”. The significance of this
    change is that we, as Communists, should and will support
    bourgeois-liberation movements in the colonies only when they are
    genuinely revolutionary, and when their exponents do not hinder
    our work of educating and organising in a revolutionary spirit the
    peasantry and the masses of the exploited. If these conditions do
    not exist, the Communists in these countries must combat the
    reformist bourgeoisie, to whom the heroes of the Second
    International also belong. Reformist parties already exist in the
    colonial countries, and in some cases their spokesmen call
    themselves Social-Democrats and socialists. The distinction I have
    referred to has been made in all the theses with the result, I
    think, that our view is now formulated much more precisely. 
Next, I would like to make a remark on the subject of
    peasants’ Soviets. The Russian Communists’ practical
    activities in the former tsarist colonies, in such backward
    countries as Turkestan, etc., have confronted us with the question
    of how to apply the communist tactics and policy in pre-capitalist
    conditions. The preponderance of pre-capitalist relationships is
    still the main determining feature in these countries, so that
    there can be no question of a purely proletarian movement in
    them. There is practically no industrial proletariat in these
    cotmtries. Nevertheless, we have assumed, we must assume, the role
    of leader even there. Experience has shown us that tremendous
    difficulties have to be surmounted in these countries. However,
    the practical results of our work have also shown that despite
    these difficulties we are in a position to inspire in the masses
    an urge for independent political thinking and independent
    political action, even where a proletariat is practically
    non-existent. This work has been more difficult for us than it
    will be for comrades in the West-European countries, because in
    Russia the proletariat is engrossed in the work of state
    administration. It will reaaily be understood that peasants living
    in conditions of semi-feudal dependence can easily assimilate and
    give effect to the idea of Soviet organisation. It is also clear
    that the oppressed masses, those who are exploited, not only by
    merchant capital but also by the feudalists, and by a state based
    on feudalism, can apply this weapon, this type of organisation, in
    their conditions too. The idea of Soviet organisation is a simple
    one, and is applicable, not only to proletarian, but also to
    peasant feudal and semi-feudal relations. Our experience in this
    respect is not as yet very considerable. However, the debate in
    the commission, in which several representatives from colonial
    countries participated, demonstrated convincingly that the
    Communist International’s theses should point out that
    peasants’ Soviets, Soviets of the exploited, are a weapon
    which can be employed, not only in capitalist countries but also
    in countries with pre-capitalist relations, and that it is the
    absolute duty of Communist parties and of elements prepared to
    form Communist parties, everywhere to conduct propaganda in favour
    of peasants’ Soviets or of working people’s Soviets,
    this to include backward and colonial countries. Wherever
    conditions permit, they should at once make attempts to set up
    Soviets the working people. 
This opens up a very interesting and very important field for
    our practical work. So far our joint experience in this respect
    has not been extensive, but more and more data will gradually
    accumulate. It is unquestionable that the proletariat of the
    advanced countries can and should give help to the working masses
    of the backward countries, and that the backward countries can
    emerge from their present stage of development when the victorious
    proletariat of the Soviet Republics extends a helping hand to
    these masses and is in a position to give them support. 
There was quite a lively debate on this question in the
    commission, not only in connection with the theses I signed, but
    still more in connection with Comrade Roy’s theses, which he
    will defend here, and certain amendments to which were unanimously
    adopted. 
The question was posed as follows: are we to consider as
    correct the assertion that the capitalist stage of economic
    development is inevitable for backward nations now on the road to
    emancipation and among whom a certain advance towards progress is
    to be seen since the war? We replied in the negative. If the
    victorious revolutionary proletariat conducts systematic
    propaganda among them, and the Soviet governments come to their
    aid with all the means at their disposal—in that event it
    will be mistaken to assume that the backward peoples must
    inevitably go through the capitalist stage of development. Not
    only should we create independent contingents of fighters and
    party organisations in the colonies and the backward countries,
    not only at once launch propaganda for the organisation of
    peasants’ Soviets and strive to adapt them to the
    pre-capitalist conditions, but the Communist International should
    advance the proposition, with the appropriate theoretical
    grounding, that with the aid of the proletariat of the advanced
    countries, backward countries can go over to the Soviet system
    and, through certain stages of development, to communism, without
    having to pass through the capitalist stage. 
The necessary means for this cannot be indicated in
    advance. These will be prompted by practical experience. It has,
    however, been definitely established that the idea of the Soviets
    is understood by the mass of the working people in even the most
    remote nations, that the Soviets should be adapted to the
    conditions of a pre-capitalist social system, and that the
    Communist parties should immediately begin work in this direction
    in all parts of the world.
 I would also like to emphasise the importance of revolutionary
    work by the Communist parties, not only in their own, but also in
    the colonial countries, and particularly among the troops employed
    by the exploiting nations to keep the colonial peoples in
    subjection. 
Comrade Quelch of the British Socialist Party spoke of this in
    our commission. He said that the rank-and-file British worker
    would consider it treasonable to help the enslaved nations in
    their uprisings against British rule. True, the jingoist and
    chauvinist-minded labour aristocrats of Britain and America
    present a very great danger to socialism, and are a bulwark of the
    Second International. Here we are confronted with the greatest
    treachery on the part of leaders and workers belonging to this
    bourgeois International. The colonial question has been discussed
    in the Second International as well.[7] The Basle Manifesto[8] is quite clear on this point, too. The
    parties of the Second International have pledged themselves to
    revolutionary action, but they have given no sign of genuine
    revolutionary work or of assistance to the exploited and dependent
    nations in their revolt against the oppressor nations. This, I
    think, applies also to most of the parties that have withdrawn
    from the Second International and wish to join the Third
    International. We must proclaim this publicly for all to hear, and
    it is irrefutable. We shall see if any attempt is made to deny
    it. 
All these considerations have formed the basis of our
    resolutions, which undoubtedly are too lengthy but will
    nevertheless, I am sure, prove of use and will promote the
    development and organisation of genuine revolutionary work in
    connection with the national and the colonial questions. And that
    is our principal task.

Speech On The Terms Of Admission 
      Into The Communist International 
      July 
      30 [9]

      Comrades, Serrati has said that we have not yet invented a
      sincerometer—meaning by this French neologism an
      instrument for measuring sincerity. No such instrument has been
      invented yet. We have no need of one. But we do already have an
      instrument for defining trends. Comrade Serrati’s error,
      which I shall deal with later, consists in his having failed to
      use this instrument, which has been known for a long time. 
I would like to say only a few words about Comrade Crispien. I
    am very sorry that he is not present. (Dittmann:
    “He is ill.”) I am very sorry to hear it. His speech
    is a most important document, and expresses explicitly the
    political line of the Right wing of the Independent
    Social-Democratic Party. I shall speak, not of personal
    circumstances or individual cases but only of the ideas clearly
    expressed in Crispien’s speech. I think I shall be able to
    prove that the entire speech was thoroughly in the Kautskian
    spirit, and that Comrade Crispien shares the Kautskian views on
    the dictatorship of the proletariat. Replying to a rejoinder,
    Crispien said: “Dictatorship is nothing new, it was already
    mentioned in the Erfurt Programme.”[10] The Erfurt Programme
    says nothing about the dictatorship of the proletariat, and
    history has proved that this was not due to chance. When in
    1902-03, we were drawing up our Party’s first programme, we
    always had before us the example of the Erfurt Programme;
    Plekhanov, that very Plekhanov who rightly said at the time,
    “Either Bernstein will bury Social-Democracy, or
    Social-Democracy will bury Bernstein”, laid special emphasis
    on the fact that the Erfurt Programme’s failure to mention
    the dictatorship of the proletariat was erroneous from the
    standpoint of theory and, in practice was a cowardly concession to
    the opportunists. The dictatorship of the proletariat has been in
    our programme since 1903.[11] 
When Comrade Crispien now says that the dictatorship of the
    proletariat is nothing new, and goes on to say: “We have
    always stood for the conquest of political power”, he is
    evading the gist of the matter. Conquest of political power is
    recognised, but not dictatorship. All the socialist
    literature—not only German, but French and British as
    well—shows that the leaders of the opportunist parties, for
    instance, MacDonald in Britain, stand for the conquest of
    political power. They are, in all conscience, sincere socialists,
    but they are against the dictatorship of the proletariat! Since we
    have a good revolutionary party worthy of the name of Communist,
    it should conduct propaganda for the dictatorship of the
    proletariat, as distinct from the old conception of the Second
    International. This has been glossed over and obscured by Comrade
    Crispien, which is the fundamental error common to all of
    Kautsky’s adherents. 
“We are leaders elected by the masses, “ Comrade
    Crispien continues. This is a formal and erroneous point of view,
    since a struggle of trends was clearly to be seen at the latest
    Party congress of the German Independents. There is no need to
    seek for a sincerometer and to wax humorous on the subject, as
    Comrade Serrati does, in order to establish the simple fact that a
    struggle of trends must and does exist: one trend is that of the
    revolutionary workers who have just joined us and are opposed to
    the labour aristocracy; the other is that of the labour
    aristocracy, which in all civilised countries is headed by the old
    leaders. Does Crispien belong to the trend of the old leaders and
    the labour aristocracy, or to that of the new revolutionary masses
    of workers, who are opposed to the labour aristocracy? That is a
    question Comrade Crispien has failed to clarify. 
In what kind of tone does Comrade Crispien speak of the split?
    He has said that the split was a bitter necessity, and deplored
    the matter at length. That is quite in the Kautskian spirit. Who
    did they break away from? Wasit not from Scheidemann? Of course,
    it was. Crispien has said: “We have split away.” In
    the first place, this was done too late. Since we are on the
    subject, that has to be said. Second, the Independents should not
    deplore this, but should say: “The international working
    class is still under the sway of the labour aristocracy and the
    opportunists.” Such is the position both in France and in
    Great Britain. Comrade Crispien does not regard the split like a
    Communist, but quite in the spirit of Kautsky, who is supposed to
    have no influence. Then Crispien went on to speak of high
    wages. The position in Germany, he said, is that the workers are
    quite well off compared with the workers in Russia or in general,
    in the East of Europe. A revolution, as he sees it, can be made
    only if it does not worsen the workers’ conditions
    “too much”. Is it permissible, in a Communist Party,
    to speak in a tone like this, I ask? This is the language of
    counter-revolution. The standard of living in Russia is
    undoubtedly lower than in Germany, and when we established the
    dictatorship, this led to the workers beginning to go more hungry
    and to their conditions becoming even worse. The workers’
    victory cannot be achieved without sacrifices, without a temporary
    deterioration of their conditions. We must tell the workers the
    very opposite of what Crispien has said. If, in desiring to
    prepare the workers for the dictatorship, one tells them that
    their conditions will not be worsened “too much”, one
    is losing sight of the main thing, namely, that it was by helping
    their “own” bourgeoisie to conquer and strangle the
    whole world by imperialist methods, with the aim of thereby
    ensuring better pay for themselves, that the labour aristocracy
    developed. If the German workers now want to work for the
    revolution they must make sacrifices, and not be afraid to do
    so. 
In the general and world-historical sense, it is true that in a
    backward country like China, the coolie cannot bring about a
    proletarian revolution; however, to tell the workers in the
    handful of rich countries where life is easier, thanks to
    imperialist pillage, that they must be afraid of “too
    great” impoverishment, is counter-revolutionary. It is the
    reverse that they should be told. The labour aristocracy that is
    afraid of sacrifices, afraid of “too great” impover-
    ishment during the revolutionary struggle, cannot belong to the
    Party. Otherwise the dictatorship is impossible, especially in
    West-European countries. 
What does Crispien say about terror and coercion? He has said
    that these are two different things. Perhaps such a distinction is
    possible in a manual of sociology, but it cannot be made in
    political practice, especially in the conditions of Germany. We
    are forced to resort to coercion and terror against people who
    behave like the German officers did when they murdered Liebknecht
    and Rosa Luxemburg, or against people like Stinnes and Krupp, who
    buy up the press. Of course, there is no need to proclaim in
    advance that we shall positively resort to terror but if the
    German officers and the Kappists remain the same as they now are
    and if Krupp and Stinnes remain the same as they now are, the
    employment of terror will be inevitable. Not only Kautsky, but
    Ledebour and Crispien as well, speak of coercion and terror in a
    wholly counter revolutionary spirit. A party that makes shift with
    such ideas cannot participate in the dictatorship. That is self
    evident. 
Then there is the agrarian question. Here Crispien has got very
    worked up and tried to impute a petty-bourgeois spirit to us: to
    do anything for the small peasant at the expense of the big
    landowner is alleged to be petty-bourgeois action. He says the
    landed proprietors should be dispossessed and their land handed
    over to co-operative associations. This is a pedantic
    viewpoint. Even in highly developed countries, including Germany,
    there are a sufficient number of latifundia, landed estates that
    are cultivated by semi-feudal, not large-scale capitalist,
    methods. Part of such land may be cut off and turned over to the
    small peasants, without injury to farming. Large-scale farming can
    be preserved, and yet the small peasants can be provided with
    something of considerable importance to them. No thought is given
    to this, unfortunately, but in practice that has to be done, for
    otherwise you will fall into error. This has been borne out, for
    example, in a book by Varga (former People’s Commissar for
    the National Economy in the Hungarian Soviet Republic), who writes
    that the establishment of the proletarian dictatorship hardly
    changed anything in the Hun-garian countryside, that the
    day-labourers saw no changes, and the small peasants got
    nothing. There are large latifundia in Hungary, and a semi-feudal
    economy is conducted in large areas. Sections of large estates can
    and must always be found, part of which can be turned over to the
    small peasants, perhaps not as their property, but on lease, so
    that even the smallest peasant may get some part of the
    confiscated estates. Otherwise, the small peasant will see no
    difference between the old order and the dictatorship of the
    Soviets. If the proletarian state authority does not act in this
    way, it will be unable to retain power. 
Although Crispien did say: “You cannot deny that we have
    our revolutionary convictions”, I shall reply that I do deny
    them. I do not say that you would not like to act in revolutionary
    manner, but I do say that you are unable to reason in a
    revolutionary fashion. I am willing to wager that if we chose any
    commission of educated people, and gave them a dozen
    Kautsky’s books and then Crispien’s speech, the
    commission would say: “The whole speech is thoroughly
    Kautskian, is imbued through and through with Kautsky’s
    views.” The entire method of Crispien’s argumentation
    is fundamentally Kautskian, yet Crispien comes along and says,
    “Kautsky no longer has any influence whatever in our
    party.” No influence, perhaps, on the revolutionary workers
    who have joined recently. However, it must be accepted as
    absolutely proved that Kautsky has had and still has an enormous
    influence on Crispien, on his entire line of thought, all his
    ideas. This is manifest in his speech. That is why, without
    inventing any sincerometers, any instruments for measuring
    sincerity, we can say that Crispien’s orientation is not
    that of the Communist International. In saying this, we are
    defining the orientation of the entire Communist
    International. 
Comrades Wijnkoop and Munzenberg have expressed dissatisfaction
    with the fact that we have invited the Independent Socialist Party
    and are holding talks with its representatives. I think they are
    wrong. When Kautsky attacks us and brings out books against us, we
    polemise with him as our class enemy. But when the Independent
    Social-Democratic Party, which has expanded as a result of an
    influx of revolutionary workers, comes here for negoti- ations, we
    must talk to its representatives, since they are a section of the
    revolutionary workers. We cannot reach an immediate agreement with
    the German Independents, or with the French and the British,
    regarding the International. In every speech he delivers, Comrade
    Wijnkoop reveals that he shares almost all the errors of Comrade
    Pannekoek. Wijnkoop has stated that he does not share
    Pannekoek’s views; but his speeches prove the
    reverse. Herein lies the main error of this “Left”
    group, but this, in general, is an error of a proletarian movement
    that is developing. The speeches of Comrades Crispien and Dittmann
    are imbued with a bourgeois spirit which will not help us prepare
    for the dictatorship of the proletariat. When Comrades Wijnkoop
    and Muinzenberg go still further on the subject of the Independent
    Social-Democratic Party, we are not in agreement with them. 
Of course, we have no instrument for measuring sincerity, as
    Serrati has put it, for testing a man’s conscience; we quite
    agree that the matter is not one of forming an opinion of people,
    but of appraising a situation. I am sorry to say that although
    Serrati did speak he said nothing new. His was the sort of speech
    we used to hear in the Second International as well. 
Serrati was wrong in saying: “In France the situation is
    not revolutionary; in Germany it is revolutionary; in Italy it is
    revolutionary.” 
Even if the situation is non-revolutionary, the Second
    International is in error and carries a heavy responsibility if it
    is really unwilling to organise revolutionary propaganda and
    agitation, since, as has been proved by the entire history of the
    Bolshevik Party, revolutionary propaganda can and should be
    conducted even in a situation that is not revolutionary. The
    difference between the socialists and the Communists consists in
    the former refusing to act in the way we act in any situation,
    i.e., conduct revolutionary work. 
Serrati merely repeats what Crispien has said. We do not mean
    to say that Turati should be expelled on such and such a
    date. That question has already been touched upon by the Executive
    Committee, and Serrati has said to us: “Not expulsions, but
    a Party purge.” We must simply tellthe Italian comrades that
    it is the line of L’Ordine Nuovo members that
    corresponds to the line of the Communist International, and not
    that of the present majority of the Socialist Party’s
    leaders and their parliamentary group. They claim that they want
    to defend the proletariat against the reactionaries. Chernov, the
    Mensheviks and many others in Russia are also
    “defending” the proletariat against the reactionaries,
    but that is not sufficient reason for accepting them into our
    midst. 
That is why we must say to the Italian comrades and all parties
    that have a Right wing: this reformist tendency has nothing in
    common with communism. 
We ask our Italian comrades to call a congress and have our
    theses and resolutions submitted to it. I am sure that the Italian
    workers will want to remain in the Communist International. 

5
Speech On Parliamentarianism 
      August 2
Comrade Bordige seems to have wanted to defend the Italian
    Marxists’ point of view here, yet he has failed to reply to
    any of the arguments advanced by other Marxists in favour of
    parliamentary action. 
Comrade Bordiga has admitted that historical experience is not
    created artificially. He has just told us that the struggle must
    be carried into another sphere. Is he not aware that every
    revolutionary crisis has been attended by a parliamentary crisis?
    True, he has said that the struggle must be carried into another
    sphere, into the Soviets. Bordiga, however, has himself admitted
    that Soviets cannot be created artificially. The example of Russia
    shows that Soviets can be organised either during a revolution or
    on the eve of a revolution. Even in the Kerensky period, the
    Soviets (which were Menshevik Soviets) were organised in such a
    way that they could not possibly constitute a proletarian
    government. Parliament is a product of historical development, and
    we cannot eliminate it until we are strong enough to disperse the
    bourgeois parliament. It is only as a member of the bourgeois
    parliament that one can, in the given historical conditions, wage
    a struggle against bourgeois society and parliamentarianism. The
    same weapon as the bourgeoisie employs in the struggle must also
    be used by the proletariat, of course, with entirely different
    aims. You cannot assert that that is not the case, and if you want
    to challenge it, you will have thereby to erase the experience of
    all revolutionary developments in the world. 
You have said that the trade unions are also opportunist, that
    they, too, constitute a danger. On the other hand, however, you
    have said that an exception must be made in the case of trade
    unions, because they are workers’ organisations. But that is
    true only up to a certain point. There are very backward elements
    in the trade unions too: a section of the proletarianised petty
    bourgeoisie, the backward workers, and the small peasants. All
    these elements really think that their interests are represented
    in parliament. This idea must be combated by work within
    parliament and by citing the facts, so as to show the masses the
    truth. Theory will have no effect on the backward masses; they
    need practical experience. 
This was to be seen in the case of Russia too. We were obliged
    to convene the Constituent Assembly even after the victory of the
    proletariat, so as to prove to the backward proletarians that they
    had nothing to gain from that Assembly. To bring home the
    difference between the two, we had to concretely contrapose the
    Soviets and the Constituent Assembly and to show the Soviets as
    the only solution. 
Comrade Souchy, a revolutionary syndicalist, advocated the same
    theory, but he had no logic on his side. He said that he was not a
    Marxist, so everything can be readily understood. But you, Comrade
    Bordiga, assert that you are a Marxist, so we must expect more
    logic from you. You must know how parliament can be smashed. If
    you can do it by an armed uprising in all countries, well and
    good. You are aware that we in Russia proved our determination to
    destroy the bourgeois parliament, not only in theory, but in
    practice as well. You, however, have lost sight of the fact that
    this is impossible without fairly long preparations, and that in
    most countries it is as yet impossible to destroy parliament at
    one stroke. We are obliged to carry on a struggle within
    parliament for the destruction of parliament. For the conditions
    determining the political line of all classes in modern society
    you substitute your revolutionary determination; that is why you
    forget that to destroy the bourgeois parliament in Russia we were
    first obliged to convene the Constituent Assembly, even after our
    victory. You say: “It is a fact that the Russian revolution
    is a case that is not in accord with conditions in Western
    Europe”, but you have not produced a single weighty argument
    to prove that to us. We went through a period of bourgeois
    democracy. We went through it rapidly at a time when we had to
    agitate for elections to the Constituent Assembly. Later, when the
    working class was able to seize power, the peasants still believed
    in the necessity of a bourgeois parliament. 
Taking account of these backward elements, we had to proclaim
    the elections and show the masses, by example and by facts, that
    the Constituent Assembly, which was elected at a time of dire and
    universal need, did not express the aspirations and demands of the
    exploited classes. In this way the conflict between Soviet and
    bourgeois government became quite clear, not only to us, the
    vanguard of the working class, but also to the vast majority of
    the peasantry, to the petty office employees, the petty
    bourgeoisie, etc. In all capitalist countries there are backward
    elements in the working class who are convinced that parliament is
    the true representative of the people and do not see the
    unscrupulous methods employed there. You say that parliament is an
    instrument with the aid of which the bourgeoisie deceive the
    masses. But this argument should be turned against you, and it
    does turn against your theses. How will you reveal the true
    character of parliament to the really backward masses, who are
    deceived by the bourgeoisie? How will you expose the various
    parliamentary manoeuvres, or the positions of the various parties,
    if you are not in parliament, if you remain outside parliament? If
    you are Marxists, you must admit that, in capitalist society,
    there is a close link between the relations of classes and the
    relations of parties. How, I repeat, will you show all this if you
    are not members of parliament, and if you renounce parliamentary
    action? The history of the Russian revolution has clearly shown
    that the masses of the working class, the peasantry, and petty
    office employees could not have been convinced by any arguments,
    unless their own experience had convinced them. 
It has been claimed here that it is a waste of time to
    participate in the parliamentary struggle. Can one conceive of any
    other institution in which all classes are as interested as they
    are in parliament? This cannot be created artificially. If all
    classes are drawn into the parliamentary struggle, it is because
    the class interests and conaicts are reflected in parliament. If
    it were possible everywhere and immediately to bring about, let us
    say, a decisive general strike so as to overthrow capitalism at a
    single stroke, the revolution would have already taken place in a
    number of countries. But we must reckon with the facts, and
    parliament is a scene of the class struggle. Comrade Bordiga and
    those who share his views must tell the masses the truth. Germany
    provides the best example that a Communist group in parliament is
    possible. That is why you should have frankly said to the masses:
    “We are too weak to create a party with a strong
    organisation.” That would be the truth that ought to be
    told. But if you confessed your weakness to the masses, they would
    become your opponents, not your supporters; they would become
    supporters of parliamentarianism. 
If you say: “Fellow workers, we are so weak that we
    cannot form a party disciplined enough to compel its members of
    parliament to submit to it”, the workers would abandon you,
    for they would ask themselves: “How can we set up a
    dictatorship of the proletariat with such weaklings?” 
You are very naïve if you think that the intelligentsia,
    the middle class, and the petty bourgeoisie will turn Communist
    the day the proletariat is victorious. 
If you do not harbour this illusion, you should begin right
    away to prepare the proletariat to pursue its own line. You will
    find no exceptions to this rule in any branch of state affairs. On
    the day following the revolution, you will everywhere find
    advocates of opportunism who call themselves-Communists, i.e.,
    petty bourgeois who refuse to recognise the discipline of the
    Communist Party or of the proletarian state. Unless you prepare
    the workers for the creation of a really disciplined party, which
    will compel its members to submit to its discipline, you will
    never prepare for the dictatorship of the proletariat. I think
    that this accounts for your unwillingness to admit that the
    repudiation of parliamentary action by a great many of the new
    Communist parties stems from their weakness. I am convinced that
    the vast majority of the really revolutionary workers will follow
    us and speak up against your anti-parliamentary theses.

 Speech On Affiliation To The British Labour 

      Party[12] 
      August 6
    
Comrades, Comrade Gallacher began his speech by expressing
    regret at our having been compelled to listen here for the
    hundredth and the thousandth time to sentences that Comrade
    McLaine and other British comrades have reiterated a thousand
    times in speeches, newspapers and magazines. I think there is no
    need for regret. The old International used the method of
    referring such questions for decision to the individual parties in
    the countries concerned. That was a grave error. We may not be
    fully familiar with the conditions in one country or another, but
    in this case we are dealing with the principles underlying a
    Communist Party’s tactics. That is very important and, in
    the name of the Third International, we must herewith clearly
    state the communist point of view. 
First of all, I should like to mention a slight inaccuracy on
    the part of Comrade McLaine, which cannot be agreed to. He called
    the Labour Party the political organisation of the trade union
    movement, and later repeated the statement when he said that the
    Labour Party is “the political expression of the workers
    organised in trade unions”. I have met the same view several
    times in the paper of the British Socialist Party. It is
    erroneous, and is partly the cause of the opposition, fully
    justified in some measure, coming from the British revolutionary
    workers. Indeed, the concepts “political department of the
    trade unions “ or “political expression” of the
    trade union movement, are erroneous. Of course, most of the Labour
    Party’s members are workingmen. However, whether or not a
    party is really a political party of the workers does not depend
    solely upon a membership of workers but also upon the men that
    lead it, and the content of its actions and its political
    tactics. Only this latter determines whether we really have before
    us a political party of the proletariat. Regarded from this, the
    only correct, point of view, the Labour Party is a thoroughly
    bourgeois party, because, although made up of workers, it is led
    by reactionaries, and the worst kind of reactionaries at that, who
    act quite in the spirit of the bourgeoisie. It is an organisation
    of the bourgeoisie, which exists to systematically dupe the
    workers with the aid of the British Noskes and Scheidemanns. 
We have also heard another point of view, defended by Comrade
    Sylvia Pankhurst and Comrade Gallacher, who have voiced their
    opinion in the matter. What was the substance of the speeches
    delivered by Gallacher and many of his friends? They have told us
    that they are insufficiently linked with the masses. But take the
    instance of the British Socialist Party, they went on. It is still
    less linked with the masses and it is a very weak party. Comrade
    Gallacher has told us here how he and his comrades have organised,
    and done so really splendidly, the revolutionary movement in
    Glasgow, in Scotland, how in their wartime tactics they manoeuvred
    skillfully, how they gave able support to the petty-bourgeois
    pacifists Ramsay MacDonald and Snowden when they came to Glasgow,
    and used this support to organise a mass movement against the
    war. 
It is our aim to integrate this new and excellent revolutionary
    movement—represented here by Comrade Gallacher and his
    friends—into a Communist Party with genuinely communist,
    i.e., Marxist tactics. That is our task today. On the one hand,
    the British Socialist Party is too weak and incapable of properly
    carrying on agitation among the masses; on the other hand, we have
    the younger revolutionary elements so well represented here by
    Comrade Gallacher, who, although in touch with the masses, are not
    a political party, and in this sense are even weaker than the
    British Socialist Party and are totally unable to organise their
    political work. Under these circumstances, we must express our
    frank opinion on the correct tactics. When, in speaking of the
    British Socialist Party, Comrade Gallacher said that it is
    “hopelessly reformist”, he was undoubtedly
    exaggerating. But the general tenor and content of all the
    resolutions we 
    have adopted here show with absolute clarity that we demand a
    change, in this spirit, in the tactics of the British Socialist
    Party; the only correct tactics of Gallacher’s friends will
    consist in their joining the Communist Party without delay, so as
    to modify its tactics in the spirit of the resolutions adopted
    here. If you have so many supporters that you are able to organise
    mass meetings in Glasgow, it will not be difficult for you to
    bring more than ten thousand new members into the Party. The
    latest Conference of the British Socialist Party, held in London
    three or four days ago, decided to assume the name of the
    Communist Party and introduced into its programme a clause
    providing for participation in parliamentary elections and
    affiliation to the Labour Party. Ten thousand organised members
    were represented at the Conference. It will therefore not be at
    all difficult for the Scottish comrades to bring into this
    “Communist Party of Great Britain” more than ten
    thousand revolutionary workers who are better versed in the art of
    working among the masses, and thus to modify the old tactics of
    the British Socialist Party in the sense of better agitation and
    more revolutionary action. In the commission, Comrade Sylvia
    Pankhurst pointed out several times that Britain needed
    “Lefts”. I, of course, replied that this was
    absolutely true, but that one must not overdo this
    “Leftism”. Furthermore she said that they were better
    pioneers, but for the moment were rather noisy. I do not take this
    in a bad sense, but rather in a good one, namely, that they are
    better able to carry on revolutionary agitation. We do and should
    value this. We expressed this in all our resolutions, for we
    always emphasise that we can consider a party to be a
    workers’ party only when it is really linked up with the
    masses and fights against the old and quite corrupt leaders,
    against both the Right-wing chauvinists and those who, like the
    Right Independents in Germany, take up an intermediate
    position. We have asserted and reiterated this a dozen times and
    more in all our resolutions, which means that we demand a
    transformation of the old party, in the sense of bringing it
    closer to the masses. 
Sylvia Pankhurst also asked: “Is it possible for a
    Communist Party to join another political party which still belongs
    to the Second International?” She replied that it was
    not. It should, however, be borne in mind that the British Labour
    Party is in a very special position: it is a highly original type
    of party, or rather, it is not at all a party in the ordinary
    sense of the word. It is made up of members of all trade unions,
    and has a membership of about four million, and allows sufficient
    freedom to all affiliated political parties. It thus includes a
    vast number of British workers who follow the lead of the worst
    bourgeois elements, the social-traitors, who are even worse than
    Scheidemann, Noske and similar people. At the same time, however,
    the Labour Party has let the British Socialist Party into its
    ranks, permitting it to have its own press organs, in which
    members of the selfsame Labour Party can freely and openly declare
    that the party leaders are social-traitors. Comrade McLaine has
    cited quotations from such statements by the British Socialist
    Party. I, too, can certify that I have seen in The Call,
    organ of the British Socialist Party, statements that the Labour
    Party leaders are social-patriots and social-traitors. This shows
    that a party affiliated to the Labour Party is able, not only to
    severely criticise but openly and specifically to mention the old
    leaders by name, and call them social-traitors. This is a very
    original situation: a party which unites enormous masses of
    workers, so that it might seem a political party, is nevertheless
    obliged to grant its members complete latitude. Comrade McLaine
    has told us here that, at the Labour Party Conference, the British
    Scheidemanns were obliged to openly raise the question of
    affiliation to the Third International, and that all party
    branches and sections were obliged to discuss the matter. In such
    circumstances, it would be a mistake not to join this party. 
In a private talk, Comrade Pankhurst said to me: “If we
    are real revolutionaries and join the Labour Party, these
    gentlemen will expel us.” But that would not be bad at
    all. Our resolution says that we favour affiliation insofar as the
    Labour Party permits sufficient freedom of criticism. On that
    point we are absolutely consistent. Comrade McLaine has emphasised
    that the conditions now prevailing in Britain are such that,
    should it so desire, a political party may remain a revolutionary
    workers’ party even if it is connected with a special kind
    of labour organisation of four million members, which is half
    trade union and half political and is headed by bourgeois
    leaders. In such circumstances it would be highly erroneous for
    the best revolutionary elements not to do everything possible to
    remain in such a party. Let the Thomases and other
    social-traitors, whom you have called by that name, expel
    you. That will have an excellent effect upon the mass of the
    British workers. 
The comrades have emphasised that the labour aristocracy is
    stronger in Britain than in any other country. That is true. After
    all, the labour aristocracy has existed in Britain, not for
    decades but for centuries. The British bourgeoisie, which has had
    far more experience—democratic experience—than that of
    any other country, has been able to buy workers over and to create
    among them a sizable stratum, greater than in any other country,
    but one that is not so great compared with the masses of the
    workers. This stratum is thoroughly imbued with bourgeois
    prejudices and pursues a definitely bourgeois reformist policy. In
    Ireland, for instance, there are two hundred thousand British
    soldiers who are applying ferocious terror methods to suppress the
    Irish. The British Socialists are not conducting any revolutionary
    propaganda among these soldiers, though our resolutions clearly
    state that we can accept into the Communist International only
    those British parties that conduct genuinely revolutionary
    propaganda among the British workers and soldiers. I emphasise
    that we have heard no objections to this either here or in the
    commissions. 
Comrades Gallacher and Sylvia Pankhurst cannot deny that. They
    cannot refute the fact that, in the ranks of the Labour Party, the
    British Socialist Party enjoys sufficient freedom to write that
    certain leaders of the Labour Party are traitors; that these old
    leaders represent the interests of the bourgeoisie; that they are
    agents of the bourgeoisie in the working-class movement. They
    cannot deny all this because it is the absolute truth. When
    Communists enjoy such freedom it is their duty to join the Labour
    Party if they take due account of the experience of
    revolutionaries in all countries, not only of the Russian
    revolution (for here we are not at a Russian congress but at one
    that is international). Comrade Gallacher has said ironically that
    in the present instance we are under the influence of the British
    Socialist Party. That is not true; it is the experience of all
    revolutions in all countries that has convinced us. We think that
    we must say that to the masses. The British Communist Party must
    retain the freedom necessary to expose and criticise the betrayers
    of the working class, who are much more powerful in Britain than
    in any other country. That is readily understandable. Comrade
    Gallacher is wrong in asserting that by advocating affiliation to
    the Labour Party we shall repel the best elements among the
    British workers. We must test this by experience. We are convinced
    that all the resolutions and decisions that will be adopted by our
    Congress will be published in all British revolutionary socialist
    newspapers and that all the branches and sections will be able to
    discuss them. The entire content of our resolutions shows with
    crystal clarity that we are representatives of working-class
    revolutionary tactics in all countries and that our aim is to
    fight against the old reformism and opportunism. The events reveal
    that our tactics are indeed defeating the old reformism. In that
    case the finest revolutionary elements in the working class, who
    are dissatisfied with the slow progress being made—and
    progress in Britain will perhaps be slower than in other
    countries—will all come over to us. Progress is slow because
    the British bourgeoisie are in a position to create better
    conditions for the labour aristocracy and thereby to retard the
    revolutionary movement in Britain. That is why the British
    comrades should strive, not only to revolutionise the
    masses—they are doing that splendidly (as Comrade Gallacher
    has shown), but must at the same time strive to create a real
    working-class political party. Comrade Gallacher and Comrade
    Sylvia Pankhurst, who have both spoken here, do not as yet belong
    to a revolutionary Communist Party. That excellent proletarian
    organisation, the Shop Stewards’ movement, has not yet
    joined a political party. If you organise politically you will
    find that our tactics are based on a correct understanding of
    political developments in the past decades, and that a real
    revolutionary party can be created only when it absorbs the best
    elements of the revolutionary class and uses every opportunity to
    fight the reactionary leaders, wherever they show themselves. 
If the British Communist Party starts by acting in a
    revolutionary manner in the Labour Party, and if the Hendersons
    are obliged to expel this Party, that will be a great victory for
    the communist and revolutionary working class movement in
    Britain.

      The Second Congress of the Communist International met
      from July 19 to August 7, 1920. The opening session was held in
      Petrograd and the subsequent sessions in Moscow. It was attended
      by over 200 delegates who represented workers ’
      organisations of 37 countries. Apart from delegates representing
      the Communist parties and organisations of 31 countries, there
      were delegates from the Independent Social-Democratic Party of
      Germany, the Socialist parties of Italy and France, Industrial
      Workers of the World (Australia, Britain and Ireland), the
      National Confederation of Labour of Spain and other
      organisations. 
 Lenin directed all the preparatory work before
    the Congress. At its first session he made a report on the
    international situation and the fundamental tasks of the Communist
    International. Throughout the Congress, in his reports and
    speeches, Lenin fought uncompromisingly against the opportunist
    Centrist parties, who were attempting to penetrate into the Third
    International, and levelled sharp criticism at the
    anarcho-syndicalist trends and “Left” sectarianism of
    a number of communist organisations. Lenin took part in the work
    of various commissions and delivered reports and speeches on the
    international situation and the fundamental tasks of the Communist
    International, the national and the colonial questions, the
    agrarian question and the terms of admission into the Communist
    International. Lenin’s theses on the fundamental tasks of
    the Second Congress of the Communist International, the national
    and the colonial questions, the agrarian question and the terms of
    admission into the Communist International were endorsed as
    Congress decisions.
 The Second Congress laid the foundations of
    the programme, organisational principles, strategy and tactics of
    the Communist International;—Editor. 
[2]
      This international organisation was being set up at the time by
      the Centrist socialist parties and groups which had left the
      Second International under pressure from the revolutionary
      masses. The International Union of the Socialist Parties, as the
      new organisation was officially called was formed at a
      conference in Vienna in February 1921 and; was also known as the
      Two-and-a-Half or Vienna International. Professing opposition to
      the Second International, the leaders of the Two-and-a-Half
      International actually pursued the same opportunist and
      splitting policy on the most important questions of the
      proletarian movement and tried to make the new organisation a
      counter-balance to the growing innuence of the Communists among
      the workers. Lenin wrote, “The gentlemen of the
      Two-and-a-Half International pose as revolutionaries; but in
      every serious situation they prove to be counter-revolutionaries
      because they shrink from the violent destruction of the old
      state machine; they have no faith in the forces of the working
      class”
 In May 1923 the Second International and the
    Two-and-a-Half International united to form the so-called Labour
    and Socialist International;—Editor.

Guild socialists—a reformist trend in the British
    trade unions which arose before the First World War. They denied
    the class character of the state and sowed illusions among thc
    workers that it was possible to get rid of exploitation without
    the class struggle, by establishing, on the basis of the existing
    trade unions, special associations of producers, so-called guilds
    whose federation was to take over industrial management. In this
    way the guild socialists hoped to build socialism.
 After the October Socialist Revolution the
    Guild socialists stepped up their propaganda, contraposing the
    “theory” of guild socialism to the ideas of the class
    struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the 1920s
    guild socialism lost all its influence on the British
    workers;—Editor. 
 [4]
    The reference is to the American Federation of Labor and the
    British Labour Party. 
 The American Federation of Labor was
    formed in 1881, on the guild principle. In the main it organised
    the labour aristocracy. The reformist A.F.L. Ieaders denied the
    principles of socialism and the class struggle, preached
    “class co-operationn and championed the capitalist
    system. They followed a splitting policy in the international
    working-class movement, giving active support to the aggressive
    policy of the U.S. imperialists. In 1955 the A.F.L. merged with
    the C.I.O;—Editor.

[6b]Issue No. 5 of the Bulletin of The Sccond
    Congress of the Communist International gave the concluding
    sentences of this speech as follows: 

    

      “We must express our opinion frankly, whatever it may
      be. If the British Communists do not reach agreement on the
      question of the organisation of the mass movement, and if a
      split takes place in this issue, then better a split than
      rejection of the organisation of the mass movement. It is better
      to rise to definite and sufficiently clear tactics and ideology
      than to go on remaining in the previous
      chaos.”—Editor. 
[7]
      The commission on the national and the colonial questions, formed by
      the Second Congress of the Communist International included
      representatives of the Communist parties of Russia, Bulgaria, France,
      Holland, Germany, Hungary, the U.S.A., India, Persia, China, Korea
      and Britain. The work of the commission was guided by Lenin, whose
      theses on the national and the colonial questions were discussed at
      the fourth and fifth sessions of the Congress, and were adopted on
      July 28;—Editor.
[8]
      The Basle Manifesto was adopted by the Extraordinary
      International Socialist Congress held in Basle on November
      24-25, 1912. It gave a warning against the imminent world
      imperialist war, whose predatory aims it unmasked, and called
      upon the workers of all countries to wage a determined fight for
      peace and “to pit against the might of capitalist
      imperialism the international solidarity of the
      proletariat”. The Manifesto denounced the expansionist
      policy of the imperialist countries and urged socialists to
      fight against all oppression of small nations and manifestations
      of chauvinism. 
[9] 
      The terms of admission into the Communist International were
      first discussed by a commission appointed by the Congress. The
      commission included representatives of the Communist parties of
      Russia, Germany, Bulgaria, the U.S.A., HunRary, Austria,
      Holland, the Irish I.W.W., the Left wing of the Socialist Party
      of Switzerland and the French Communist group. In its work the
      commission proceeded from Lenin’s theses “The Terms of Admission into the Communist
      International”. Lenin also worked on the
      commission. The terms of admission into the Communist
      International were discussed at three Congress sessions, July 29
      and 30, and were adopted on August
      6;—Editor. 
[10] 
      Lenin is referring to the German Social-Democratic Party’s
      programme which was adopted at its congress in Erfurt in October
      1891. This programme marked an advance over the Gotha Programme
      of 1875, since it was based on the Marsist thesis that the
      capitalist mode of production was doomed and would be inevitably
      replaced by the socialist mode of production; it stressed the
      need for the working class to wage a political struggle and
      defined the party’s role as leader in that struggle, but
      it too made serious concessions to opportunism. Engels gave a
      profound criticism of the draft of the programme in his work
      “Zur Kritik des sozialdemokratischen Programmentwurfes
      1891” (see Marx/Engels, Werke, Dietz Verlag,
      Berlin, 1963, Bd. 22, S. 225-40). In fact, Engels criticised the
      opportunism of the entire Second International. However, in
      working out the final version of the programme, the German
      Social-Democratic leaders concealed Engels’s criticism
      from the Party rank and file and disregarded his most important
      remarks. According to Lenin, the fact that the Erfurt Programme
      made no mention of the dictatorship of the proletafiat was the
      main defect in the programme, and a cowardly concession to
      opportunism;—Editor.

      International, at the closing session of the Congress on August
      6. Following Lenin’s speech the majority (58 votes against
      24, with 2 abstentions) approved affiliation. The Labour
      leaders, however, refused to grant membership to the Communist

      Speech Delivered At The Third All-Russia Congress
      
      of The Russian Young Communist League [1]


(The Congress greets Lenin with a tremendous ovation.)

      Comrades, today I would
      like to talk on the fundamental tasks of the Young Communist
      League and, in this connection, on what the youth organisations
      in a socialist republic should be like in general.

    
It is all the more necessary to dwell on this question because
      in a certain sense it may be said that it is the youth that will
      be faced with the actual task of creating a communist
      society. For it is clear that the generation of working people
      brought up in capitalist society can, at best, accomplish the
      task of destroying the foundations of the old, the capitalist
      way of life, which was built on exploitation. At best it will be
      able to accomplish the tasks of creating a social system that
      will help the proletariat and the working classes retain power
      and lay a firm foundation, which can be built on only by a
      generation that is starting to work under the new conditions, in
      a situation in which relations based on the exploitation of man
      by man no longer exist.

    
And so, in dealing from this angle with the tasks confronting
      the youth, I must say that the tasks of the youth in general,
      and of the Young Communist Leagues and all other organisations
      in particular, might be summed up in a single word: learn.

    
Of course, this is only a "single word". It does not reply to
      the principal and most essential questions: what to learn, and
      how to learn? And the whole point here is that, with the
      transformation of the old, capitalist society, the upbringing,
      training and education of the new generations that will create
      the communist society cannot be conducted on the old lines. The
      teaching, training and education of the youth must proceed from
      the material that has been left to us by the old society.  We
      can build communism only on the basis of the totality of
      knowledge, organisations and institutions, only by using the
      stock of human forces and means that have been left to us by the
      old society. Only by radically remoulding the teaching,
      organisation and training of the youth shall we be able to
      ensure that the efforts of the younger generation will result in
      the creation of a society that will be unlike the old society,
      i.e., in the creation of a communist society. That is why we
      must deal in detail with the question of what we should teach
      the youth and how the youth should learn if it really wants to
      justify the name of communist youth, and how it should be
      trained so as to be able to complete and consummate what we have
      started.

    
I must say that the first and most natural reply would
      seem to be that the Youth League, and the youth in general, who want to
      advance to communism, should learn communism.

    
But this reply -- "learn communism" -- is too general.  What do
      we need in order to learn communism? What must be singled out
      from the sum of general knowledge so as to acquire a knowledge
      of communism?  Here a number of dangers arise, which very often
      manifest themselves whenever the task of learning communism is
      presented incorrectly, or when it is interpreted in too
      one-sided a manner.

    
Naturally, the first thought that enters one's mind is that
      learning communism means assimilating the sum of knowledge that
      is contained in communist manuals, pamphlets and books. But such
      a definition of the study of communism would be too crude and
      inadequate. If the study of communism consisted solely in
      assimilating what is contained in communist books and pamphlets,
      we might all too easily obtain communist text-jugglers or
      braggarts, and this would very often do us harm, because such
      people, after learning by rote what is set forth in communist
      books and pamphlets, would prove incapable of combining the
      various branches of knowledge, and would be unable to act in the
      way communism really demands.

    
One of the greatest evils and misfortunes left to us by the
      old, capitalist society is the complete rift between books and
      practical life; we have had books explaining everything in the
      best possible manner, yet in most cases these books contained
      the most pernicious and hypocritical lies, a false description
      of capitalist society.

    
That is why it would be most mistaken merely to assimilate book
      knowledge about communism. No longer do our speeches and
      articles merely reiterate what used to be said about communism,
      because our speeches and articles are connected with our daily
      work in all fields. Without work and without struggle, book
      knowledge of communism obtained from communist pamphlets and
      works is absolutely worthless, for it would continue the old
      separation of theory and practice, the old rift which was the
      most pernicious feature of the old, bourgeois society.

    
It would be still more dangerous to set about assimilating only
      communist slogans. Had we not realised this danger in time, and
      had we not directed all our efforts to averting this danger, the
      half million or million young men and women who would have
      called themselves Communists after studying communism in this
      way would only greatly prejudice the cause of communism.

    
The question arises: how is all this to be blended for the
      study of communism? What must we take from the old schools, from
      the old kind of science? It was the declared aim of the old type
      of school to produce men with an all-round education, to teach
      the sciences in general.  We know that this was utterly false,
      since the whole of society was based and maintained on the
      division of people into classes, into exploiters and
      oppressed. Since they were thoroughly imbued with the class
      spirit, the old schools naturally gave knowledge only to the
      children of the bourgeoisie.  Every word was falsified in the
      interests of the bourgeoisie. In these schools the younger
      generation of workers and peasants were not so much educated as
      drilled in the interests of that bourgeoisie. They were trained
      in such a way as to be useful servants of the bourgeoisie, able
      to create profits for it without disturbing its peace and
      leisure. That is why, while rejecting the old type of schools,
      we have made it our task to take from it only what we require
      for genuine communist education.

    
This brings me to the reproaches and accusations which we
      constantly hear levelled at the old schools, and which often
      lead to wholly wrong conclusions. It is said that the old school
      was a school of purely book knowledge, of ceaseless drilling and
      grinding. That is true, but we must distinguish between what was
      bad in the old schools and what is useful to us, and we must be
      able to select from it what is necessary for communism.

    
The old schools provided purely book knowledge; they compelled
      their pupils to assimilate a mass of useless, superfluous and
      barren knowledge, which cluttered up the brain and turned the
      younger generation into bureaucrats regimented according to a
      single pattern. But it would mean falling into a grave error for
      you to try to draw the conclusion that one can become a
      Communist without assimilating the wealth of knowledge amassed
      by mankind.  It would be mistaken to think it sufficient to
      learn communist slogans and the conclusions of communist
      science, without acquiring that sum of knowledge of which
      communism itself is a result. Marxism is an example which shows
      how communism arose out of the sum of human knowledge.

    
You have read and heard that communist theory -- the science of
      communism created in the main by Marx, this doctrine of Marxism
      -- has ceased to be the work of a single socialist of the
      nineteenth century, even though he was a genius, and that it has
      become the doctrine of millions and tens of millions of
      proletarians all over the world, who are applying it in their
      struggle against capitalism. If you were to ask why the
      teachings of Marx have been able to win the hearts and minds of
      millions and tens of millions of the most revolutionary class,
      you would receive only one answer: it was because Marx based his
      work on the firm foundation of the human knowledge acquired
      under capitalism. After making a study of the laws governing the
      development of human society, Marx realised the inevitability of
      capitalism developing towards communism. What is most important
      is that he proved this on the sole basis of a most precise,
      detailed and profound study of this capitalist society, by fully
      assimilating all that earlier science had produced. He
      critically reshaped everything that had been created by human
      society, without ignoring a single detail. He reconsidered,
      subjected to criticism, and verified on the working-class
      movement everything that human thinking had created, and
      therefrom formulated conclusions which people hemmed in by
      bourgeois limitations or bound by bourgeois prejudices could not
      draw.

    

We must bear this in mind when, for
      example, we talk about proletarian culture.[2] We shall be unable to solve this problem
      unless we clearly realise that only a precise knowledge and
    transformation of the culture created by the entire development of
    mankind will enable us to create a proletarian culture. The latter
    is not clutched out of thin air; it is not an invention of those
    who call themselves experts in proletarian culture. That is all
    nonsense. Proletarian culture must be the logical development of
    the store of knowledge mankind has accumulated under the yoke of
    capitalist, landowner and bureaucratic society. All these roads
    have been leading, and will continue to lead up to proletarian
    culture, in the same way as political economy, as reshaped by
    Marx, has shown us what human society must arrive at, shown us the
    passage to the class struggle, to the beginning of the proletarian
    revolution.

    
When we so often hear representatives of the youth, as well as
      certain advocates of a new system of education, attacking the
      old schools, claiming that they used the system of cramming, we
      say to them that we must take what was good in the old
      schools. We must not borrow the system of encumbering young
      people's minds with an immense acount of knowledge, nine-tenths
      of which was useless and one-tenth distorted. This, however,
      does not mean that we can restrict ourselves to communist
      conclusions and learn only communist slogans. You will not
      create communism that way.  You can become a Communist only when
      you enrich your mind with a knowledge of all the treasures
      created by mankind.

    
We have no need of cramming, but we do need to develop and
      perfect the mind of every student with a knowledge of
      fundamental facts.  Communism will become an empty word, a mere
      signboard, and a Communist a mere boaster, if all the knowledge
      he has acquired is not digested in his mind. You should not
      merely assimilate this knowledge, but assimilate it critically,
      so as not to cram your mind with useless lumber, but enrich it
      with all those facts that are indispensable to the well-educated
      man of today. If a Communist took it into his head to boast
      about his communism becaused of the cut-and-dried conclusions he
      had acquired, without putting in a great deal of serious and
      hard work and without understanding facts he should examine
      critically, he would be a deplorable Communist indeed.  Such
      superficiality would be decidedly fatal. If I know that I know
      little, I shall strive to learn more; but if a man says that he
      is a Communist and that he need not know anything thoroughly, he
      will never become anything like a Communist.

    
The old schools produced servants needed by the capitalists;
      the old schools turned men of science into men who had to write
      and say whatever pleased the capitalists. We must therefore
      abolish them. But does the fact that we must abolish them,
      destroy them, mean that we should not take from them everything
      mankind has accumulated that is essential to man? Does it mean
      that we do not have to distinguish between what was necessary to
      capitalism and what is necessary to communism?

    
We are replacing the old drill-sergeant methods practised in
      bourgeois society, against the will of the majority, with the
      class-conscious discipline of the workers and peasants, who
      combine hatred of the old society with a determination, ability
      and readiness to unite and organise their forces for this
      struggle so as to forge the wills of millions and hundreds of
      millions of people -- disunited, and scattered over the
      territory of a huge country -- into a single will, without which
      defeat is inevitable.  Without this solidarity, without this
      conscious descipline of the workers and peasants, our cause is
      hopeless. Without this, we shall be unable to vanquish the
      capitalists and landowners of the whole world. We shall not even
      consolidate the foundation, let alone build a new, communist
      society on that foundation. Likewise, while condemning the old
      schools, while harbouring an absolutely justified and necessary
      hatred for the old schools, and appreciating the readiness to
      destroy them, we must realise that we must replace the old
      system of instruction, the old cramming and the old drill, with
      an ability to acquire the sum total of human knowledge, and to
      acquire it in such a way that communism shall not be something
      to be learned by rote, but something that you yourselves have
      thought over, something that will embody conclusions inevitable
      from the standpoint of present-day education.

    
That is the way the main tasks should be presented when
      we speak of the aim: learn communism.

    
I shall take a practical example to make this clear to you, and
      to demonstrate the approach to the problem of how you must
      learn.  You all know that, following the military problems,
      those of defending the republic, we are now confronted with
      economic tasks. Communist society, as we know, cannot be built
      unless we restore industry and agriculture, and that, not in the
      old way. They must be re-established on a modern basis, in
      accordance with the last word in science. You know that
      electricity is that basis, and that only after electrification
      of the entire country, of all branches of industry and
      agriculture, only when you have achieved that aim, will you be
      able to build for youselves the communist society which the
      older generation will not be able to build. Confronting you is
      the task of economically reviving the whole country, of
      reorganising and restoring both agriculture and industry on
      modern technical lines, based on modern science and technology,
      on electricity. You realise perfectly well that illiterate
      people cannot tackle electrification, and that elementary
      literacy is not enough either. It is insufficient to understand
      what electricity is; what is needed is the knowledge of how to
      apply it technically in industry and agriculture, and in the
      individual branches of industry and agriculture.  This has to be
      learnt for oneself, and it must be taught to the entire rising
      generation of working people. That is the task confronting every
      class-conscious Communist, every young person who regards
      himself a Communist and who clearly understands that, by joining
      the Young Communist League, he has pledged himself to help the
      Party build communism and to help the whole younger generation
      create a communist society. He must realise that he can create
      it only on the basis of modern education, and if he does not
      acquire this education communism will remain merely a pious
      wish.

    
It was the task of the older generation to overthrow the
      bourgeoisie. The main task then was to criticise the
      bourgeoisie, arouse hatred of the bourgeoisie among the masses,
      and foster class-consciousness and the ability to unite their
      forces. The new generation is confronted with a far more complex
      task. Your duty does not lie only in assembling your forces so
      as to uphold the workers' and peasants' government against an
      invasion instigated by the capitalists. Of course, you must do
      that; that is something you clearly realise, and is distinctly
      seen by the Communist.  However, that is not enough. You have to
      build up a communist society.  In many respects half of the work
      has been done. The old order has been destroyed, just as it
      deserved, it has been turned into a heap of ruins, just as it
      deserved. The ground has been cleared, and on this ground the
      younger communist generation must build a communist society. You
      are faced with the task of construction, and you can accomplish
      that task only by assimilating all modern knowledge, only if you
      are able to transform communism from cut-and-dried and memorised
      formulas, counsels, recipes, prescriptions and programmes into
      that living reality which gives unity to your immediate work,
      and only if you are able to make communism a guide in all your
      practical work.

    
That is the task you should pursue in educating, training and
      rousing the entire younger generation. You must be foremost
      among the millions of builders of a communist society in whose
      ranks every young man and young woman should be. You will not
      build a communist society unless you enlist the mass of young
      workers and peasants in the work of building communism.

    
This naturally brings me to the question of how we should
      teach communism and what the specific features of our methods should be.

    
I first of all shall deal here with the question of communist
      ethics.

    
You must train yourselves to be Communists. It is the task of
      the Youth League to organize its practical activities in such a
      way that, by learning, organising, uniting and fighting, its
      members shall train both themselves and all those who look to it
      for leadership; it should train Communists. The entire purpose
      of training, educating and teaching the youth of today should be
      to imbue them with communist ethics.

    
But is there such a thing as communist ethics? Is there such a
      thing as communist morality? Of course, there is. It is often
      suggested that we have no ethics of our own; very often the
      bourgeoisie accuse us Communists of rejecting all morality. This
      is a method of confusing the issue, of throwing dust in the eyes
      of the workers and peasants.

    
In what sense do we reject ethics, reject morality?

    
In the sense given to it by the bourgeoisie, who based ethics
      on God's commandments. On this point we, of course, say that we
      do not believe in God, and that we know perfectly well that the
      clergy, the landowners and the bourgeoisie invoked the name of
      God so as to further their own interests as exploiters. Or,
      instead of basing ethics on the commandments of morality, on the
      commandments of God, they based it on idealist or semi-idealist
      phrases, which always amounted to something very similar to
      God's commandments.

    
We reject any morality based on extra-human and extra-class
      concepts. We say that this is deception, dupery, stultification of the
      workers and peasants in the interests of the landowners and capitalists.

    
We say that our morality is entirely subordinated to the
      interests of the proletariat's class struggle. Our morality stems from
      the interests of the class struggle of the proletariat.

    
The old society was based on the oppression of all the workers
      and peasants by the landowners and capitalists. We had to
      destroy all that, and overthrow them but to do that we had to
      create unity. That is something that God cannot create.

    
This unity could be provided only by the factories, only by a
      proletariat trained and roused from its long slumber. Only when
      that class was formed did a mass movement arise which has led to
      what we have now -- the victory of the proletarian revolution in
      one of the weakest of countries, which for three years has been
      repelling the onslaught of the bourgeoisie of the whole
      world. We can see how the proletarian revolution is developing
      all over the world. On the basis of experience, we now say that
      only the proletariat could have created the solid force which
      the disunited and scattered peasantry are following and which
      has withstood all onslaughts by the exploiters. Only this class
      can help the working masses unite, rally their ranks and
      conclusively defend, conclusively consolidate and conclusively
      build up a communist society.

    
That is why we say that to us there is no such thing as
      a morality that stands outside human society; that is a fraud. To us morality
      is subordinated to the interests of the proletariat's class struggle.

    
What does that class struggle consist in? It consists
      in overthrowing the tsar, overthrowing the capitalists, and abolishing
      the capitalist class.

    
What are classes in general? Classes are that which permits one
      section of society to appropriate the labour of another
      section. If one section of society appropriates all the land, we
      have a landowner class and a peasant class. If one section of
      society owns the factories, shares and capital, while another
      section works in these factories, we have a capitalist class and
      a proletarian class.

    
It was not difficult to drive out the tsar -- that required
      only a few days. It was not very difficult to drive out the
      landowners -- that was done in a few months. Nor was it very
      difficult to drive out the capitalists. But it is incomparably
      more difficult to abolish classes; we still have the division
      into workers and peasants. If the peasant is installed on his
      plot of land and appropriates his surplus grain, that is, grain
      that he does not need for himself or for his cattle, while the
      rest of the people have to go without bread, then the peasant
      becomes an exploiter. The more grain he clings to, the more
      profitable he finds it; as for the rest, let them starve: "The
      more they starve, the dearer I can sell this grain." All should
      work according to a single common plan, on common land, in
      common factories and in accordance with a common system.  Is
      that easy to attain? You see that it is not as easy as driving
      out the tsar, the landowners and the capitalists. What is
      required is that the proletariat re-educate a section of the
      peasantry; it must win over the working peasants in order to
      crush the resistance of those peasants who are rich and are
      profiting from the poverty and want of the rest. Hence the task
      of the proletarian struggle is not quite completed after we have
      overthrown the tsar and driven out the landowners and
      capitalists; to accomplish that is the task of the system we
      call the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    
The class struggle is continuing; it has merely changed its
      forms. It is the class struggle of the proletariat to prevent
      the return of the old exploiters, to unite in a single union the
      scattered masses of unenlightened peasants. The class struggle
      is continuing and it is our task to subordinate all interests to
      that struggle. Our communist morality is also subordinated to
      that task. We say: morality is what serves to destroy the old
      exploiting society and to unite all the working people around
      the proletariat, which is building up a new, communist society.

    
Communist morality is that which serves this struggle and
      unites the working people against all exploitation, against all
      petty private property; for petty property puts into the hands
      of one person that which has been created by the labour of the
      whole of society. In our country the land is common property.

    
But suppose I take a piece of this common property and grow on
      it twice as much grain as I need, and profiteer on the surplus?
      Suppose I argue that the more starving people there are, the
      more they will pay? Would I then be behaving like a Communist?
      No, I would be behaving like an exploiter, like a
      proprietor. That must be combated. If that is allowed to go on,
      things will revert to the rule of the capitalists, to the rule
      of the bourgeoisie, as has more than once happened in previous
      revolutions. To prevent the restoration of the rule of the
      capitalists and the bourgeoisie, we must not allow profiteering;
      we must not allow individuals to enrich themselves at the
      expense of the rest; the working people must unite with the
      proletariat and form a communist society. This is the principal
      feature of the fundamental task of the League and the
      organisation of the communist youth.

    
Th old society was based on the principle: rob or be robbed;
      work for others or make others work for you; be a slave-owner or
      a slave.  Naturally, people brought up in such a society
      assimilate with their mother's milk, one might say, the
      psychology, the habit, the concept which says: you are either a
      slave-owner or a slave, or else, a small owner, a petty
      employee, a petty official, or an intellectual -- in short, a
      man who is concerned only with himself, and does not care a rap
      for anybody else.

    
If I work this plot of land, I do not care a rap for anybody
      else; if others starve, all the better, I shall get the more for
      my grain.  If I have a job as a doctor, engineer, teacher, or
      clerk, I do not care a rap for anybody else. If I toady to and
      please the powers that be, I may be able to keep my job, and
      even get on in life and become a bourgeois.  A Communist cannot
      harbour such a psychology and such sentiments. When the workers
      and peasants proved that they were able, by their own efforts,
      to defend themselves and create a new society -- that was the
      beginning of the new and communist education, education in the
      struggle against the exploiters, education in alliance with the
      proletariat against the self-seekers and petty proprietors,
      against the psychology and habits which say: I seek my own
      profit and don't care a rap for anything else.

    
That is the reply to the question of how the young and
      rising generation should learn communism.

    
It can learn communism only by linking up every step in its
      studies, training and education with the continuous struggle the
      proletarians and the working people are waging against the old
      society of exploiters.  When people tell us about morality, we
      say: to a Communist all morality lies in this united discipline
      and conscious mass struggle against the exploiters. We do not
      believe in an eternal morality, and we expose the falseness of
      all the fables about morality. Morality serves the purpose of
      helping human society rise to a higher level and rid itself of
      the exploitation of labour.

    
To achieve this we need that generation of young people who
      began to reach political maturity in the midst of a disciplined
      and desperate struggle against the bourgeoisie. In this struggle
      that generation is training genuine Communists; it must
      subordinate to this struggle, and link up with it, each step in
      its studies, education and training. The education of the
      communist youth must consist, not in giving them suave talks and
      moral precepts. This is not what education consists in. When
      people have seen the way in which their fathers and mothers
      lived under the yoke of the landowners and capitalists; when
      they have themselves experienced the sufferings of those who
      began the struggle against the exploiters; when they have seen
      the sacrifices made to keep what has been won, and seen what
      deadly enemies the landowners and capitalists are -- they are
      taught by these conditions to become Communists. Communist
      morality is based on the struggle for the consolidation and
      completion of communism.  That is also the basis of communist
      training, education, and teaching.  That is the reply to the
      question of how communism should be learnt.

    
We could not believe in teaching, training and education if
      they were restricted only to the schoolroom and divorced from
      the ferment of life. As long as the workers and peasants are
      oppressed by the landowners and capitalists, and as long as the
      schools are controlled by the landowners and capitalists, the
      young generation will remain blind and ignorant. Our schools
      must provide the youth with the fundamentals of knowledge, the
      ability to evolve communist views independently; they must make
      educated people of the youth. While they are attending school,
      they must learn to become participants in the struggle for
      emancipation from the exploiters.  The Young Communist League
      will justify its name as the League of the young communist
      generation only when every step in its teaching, training and
      education is linked up with participation in the common struggle
      of all working people against the exploiters. You are well aware
      that, as long as Russia remains the only workers' republic and
      the old, bourgeois system exists in the rest of the world, we
      shall be weaker than they are, and be constantly threatened with
      a new attack; and that only if we learn to be solidly united
      shall we win in the further struggle and -- having gained
      strength -- become really invincible. Thus, to be a Communist
      means that you must organise and unite the entire young
      generation and set an example of training and discipline in this
      struggle. Then you will be able to start building the edifice of
      communist society and bring it to completion.

    
To make this clearer to you, I shall quote an example.  We call
      ourselves Communists. What is a Communist? Communist is a Latin
      word. Communis is the Latin for "common". Communist
      society is a society in which all things -- the land, the
      factories -- are owned in common and the people work in
      common. That is communism.

    
Is it possible to work in common if each one works separately
      on his own plot of land? Work in common cannot be brought about
      all at once. That is impossible. It does not drop from the
      skies. It comes through toil and suffering; it is created in the
      course of struggle. The old books are of no use here; no one
      will believe them. One's own experience of life is neeeded. When
      Kolchak and Denikin were advancing from Siberia and the South,
      the peasants were on their side. They did not like Bolshevism
      because the Bolsheviks took their grain at a fixed price. But
      when the peasants in Siberia and the Ukraine experienced the
      rule of Kolchak and Denikin, they realised that they had only
      one alternative: either to go to the capitalists, who would at
      once hand them over into slavery under the landowners; or to
      follow the workers, who, it is true, did not promise a land
      flowing with milk and honey, and demanded iron discipline and
      firmness in an arduous struggle, but would lead them out of
      enslavement by the capitalists and landowners. When even the
      ignorant peasant saw and realised this from their own
      experience, they became conscious adherents of communism, who
      had gone through a severe school. It is such experience that
      must form the basis of all the activities of the Young Communist
      League.

    
I have replied to the questions of what we must learn, what we
      must take from the old schools and from the old science. I shall
      now try to answer the question of how this must be learnt. The
      answer is: only by inseparably linking each step in the
      activities of the schools, each step in training, education and
      teaching, with the struggle of all the working people against
      the exploiters.

    
I shall quote a few examples from the experience of the work of
      some of the youth organisations so as to illustrate how this
      training in communism should proceed. Everybody is talking about
      abolishing illiteracy.  You know that a communist society cannot
      be built in an illiterate country.  It is not enough for the
      Soviet government to issue an order, or for the Party to issue a
      particular slogan, or to assign a certain number of the best
      workers to this task. The young generation itself must take up
      this work. Communism means that the youth, the young men and
      women who belong to the Youth League, should say: this is our
      job; we shall unite and go into the rural districts to abolish
      illiteracy, so that there shall be no illiterates among our
      young people. We are trying to get the rising generation to
      devote their activities to this work. You know that we cannot
      rapidly transform an ignorant and illiterate Russia into a
      literate country.  But if the Youth League sets to work on the
      job, and if all young people work for the benefit of all, the
      League, with a membership of 400,000 young men and women, will
      be entitled to call itself a Young Communist League.  It is also
      a task of the League, not only to acquire knowledge itself, but
      to help those young people who are unable to extricate
      themselves by their own efforts from the toils of
      illiteracy. Being a member of the Youth League means devoting
      one's labour and efforts to the common cause. That is what a
      communist education means. Only in the course of such work do
      young men and women become real Communists. Only if they achieve
      practical results in this work will they become Communists.

    
Take, for example, work in the suburban vegetable gardens.  Is
      that not a real job of work? It is one of the tasks of the Young
      Communist League. People are starving; there is hunger in the
      factories. To save ourselves from starvation, vegetable gardens
      must be developed. But farming is being carried on in the old
      way. Therefore, more class-conscious elements should engage in
      this work, and then you will find that the number of vegetable
      gardens will increase, their acreage will grow, and the results
      will improve.  The Young Communist League must take an active
      part in this work. Every League and League branch should regard
      this as its duty.

    
The Young Communist League must be a shock force, helping in
      every job and displaying initiative and enterprise. The League
      should be an organisation enabling any worker to see that it
      consists of people whose teachings he perhaps does not
      understand, and whose teachings he may not immediately believe,
      but from whose practical work and activity he can see that they
      are really people who are showing him the right road.

    
If the Young Communist League fails to organise its work in
      this way in all fields, it will mean that it is reverting to the
      old bourgeois path. We must combine our education with the
      struggle of the working people against the exploiters, so as to
      help the former accomplish the tasks set by the teachings of
      communism.

    
The members of the League should use every spare hour to
      improve the vegetable gardens, or to organise the education of
      young people at some factory, and so on. We want to transform
      Russia from a poverty-stricken and wretched country into one
      that is wealthy. The Young Communist League must combine its
      education, learning and training with the labour of the workers
      and peasants, so as not to confine itself to schools or to
      reading communist books and pamphlets. Only by working side by
      side with the workers and peasants can one become a genuine
      Communist. It has to be generally realised that all members of
      the Youth League are literate poeple and at the same time are
      keen at their jobs. When everyone sees that we have ousted the
      old drill-ground methods from the old schools and have replaced
      them with conscious discipline, that all young men and women
      take part in subbotniks, and utilise every suburban farm to help
      the population -- people will cease to regard labour in the old
      way.

    
It is the taks of the Young Communist League to organise
      assistance everywhere, in village or city block, in such matters
      as -- and I shall take a small example -- public hygiene or the
      distribution of food. How was this done in the old, capitalist
      society? Everybody worked only for himself and nobody cared a
      straw for the aged and the sick, or whether housework was the
      concern only of the women, who, in consequence, were in a
      condition of oppression and servitude. Whose business is it to
      combat this? It is the business of the Youth Leagues, which must
      say: we shall change all this; we shall organise detachments of
      young people who will help to assure public hygiene or
      distribute food, who will conduct systematic house-to-house
      inspections, and work in an organised way for the benefit of the
      whole of society, distributing their forces properly and
      demonstrating that labour must be organised.

    
The generation of people who are now at the age of fifty cannot
      expect to see a communist society. This generation will be gone
      before then. But the generation of those who are now fifteen
      will see a communist society, and will itself build this
      society. This generation should know that the entire purpose of
      their lives is to build a communist society. In the old society,
      each family worked separtely and labour was not organised by
      anybody except the landowners and capitalists, who oppressed the
      masses of the people. We must organise all labour, no matter how
      toilsome or messy it may be, in such a way that every worker and
      peasant will be able to say: I am part of the great army of free
      labour, and shall be able to build up my life without the
      landowners and capitalists, able to help establish a communist
      system. The Young Communist League should teach all young people
      to engage in conscious and disciplined labour from an early
      age. In this way we can be confident that the problems now
      confronting us will be solved. We must assume that no less than
      ten years will be required for the electrification of the
      country, so that our impoverished land may profit from the
      latest achievements of technology. And so, the generation of
      those who are now fifteen years old, and will be living in a
      communist society in ten or twenty years' time, should tackle
      all its educational tasks in such a way that every day, in every
      village and city, the young people shall engage in the practical
      solution of some problem of labour in common, even though the
      smallest or the simplest. The success of communist construction
      will be assured when this is done in every village, as communist
      emulation develops, and the youth prove that they can unite
      their labour.  Only by regarding our every step from the
      standpoint of the success of that construction, and only by
      asking ourselves whether we have done all we can to be united
      and politically-conscious working people will the Young
      Communist League succeed in uniting its half a million members
      into a single army of labour and win universal respect. (Stormy
      applause.)

      workers' organisation. After the October Revolution Proletcult,
      whose leadership fell into the hands of Bogdanov and his
      supporters, continued to insist on independence, thus setting
      itself in opposition to the proletarian state. This led to the
      infiltration of bourgeois intellectuals, who began to exert a
      decisive influence on Proletcult. Its members actually denied
      the cultural legacy of the past, neglected cultural and
      educational work among the masses, isolated themselves from life
      and aimed at setting up a special "proletarian
      culture". Bogdanov, the chief Proletcult ideologist, paid lip
      service to Marxism, but actually preached subjective idealism,
      Machism. Besides bourgeois intellectuals who held leading
      positions in many organisations, Proletcult also included young
      workers who sincerely wished to promote cultural development in
      the Soviet state. Proletcult organisations had their heyday in
      1919. In the early 1920s they began to decline, ceasing to exist
      in 1932.

We see from Izvestia of October 8 that, in
    his address to the Proletcult Congress, Comrade Lunacharsky said
    things that were diametrically opposite to what he and I
    had agreed upon yesterday.[2]
It is necessary that a draft resolution (of the Proletcult
    Congress) should be drawn up with the utmost urgency, and that it
    should be endorsed by the Central Committee, in time to have it
    put to the vote at this very session of the
    Proletcult. On behalf of the Central Committee it should be
    submitted not later than today, for endorsement both by the
    Collegium of the People’s Commissariat of Education and by
    the Proletcult Congress, because the Congress is closing
    today.
Draft Resolution
1) All educational work in the Soviet Republic of workers and
    peasants, in the field of political education in general and in
    the field of art in particular, should be imbued with the spirit
    of the class struggle being waged by the proletariat for the
    successful achievement of the aims of its dictatorship, i.e., the
    overthrow of the bourgeoisie, the abolition of classes, and the
    elimination of all forms of exploitation of man by man.
2) Hence, the proletariat, both through its vanguardthe
    Communist Party-and through the many types of proletarian
    organisations in general, should display the utmost activity and
    play the leading part in all the work of public education.

    

      3) All the experience of modern history and, particularly, the
      more than half-century-old revolutionary struggle of the
      proletariat of all countries since the appearance of the
      Communist Manifesto has unquestionably demonstrated that
      the Marxist world outlook is the only true expression of the
      interests, the viewpoint, and the culture of the revolutionary
      proletariat.
4) Marxism has won its historic significance as the ideology of
    the revolutionary proletariat because, far from rejecting the most
    valuable achievements of the bourgeois epoch, it has, on the
    contrary, assimilated and refashioned everything of value in the
    more than two thousand years of the development of human thought
    and culture. Only further work on this basis and in this
    direction, inspired by the practical experience of the proletarian
    dictatorship as the final stage in the struggle against every form
    of exploitation, can be recognised as the development of a genuine 
      proletarian culture.
5) Adhering unswervingly to this stand of principle, the
    All-Russia Proletcult Congress rejects in the most resolute
    manner, as theoretically unsound and practically harmful, all
    attempts to invent one’s own particular brand of culture, to
    remain isolated in self-contained organisations, to draw a line
    dividing the field of work of the People’s Commissariat of
    Education and the Proletcult, or to set up a Proletcult "autonomy"
    within establishments under the People’s Commissariat of
    Education and so forth. On the contrary, the Congress enjoins all
    Proletcult organisations to fully consider themselves in duty
    bound to act as auxiliary bodies of the network of establishments
    under the People’s Commissariat of Education, and to
    accomplish their tasks under the general guidance of the Soviet
    authorities (specifically, of the People’s Commissariat of
    Education) and of the Russian Communist Party, as part of the
    tasks of the proletarian dictatorship.
Comrade Lunacharsky says that his words have been distorted. In
    that case this resolution is needed all the more
    urgently.

Endnotes
[1]
    99Lenin drew up this draft resolution for the First All-Russia
    Congress of Pioletcult, which met in Moscow from October 5 to
    October 12, 1920. When the Political Bureau of the Central
    Committee of the Party discussed the question of Proletcult on
    October 9 and 11, it proceeded from Lenin's draft resolution. It
    was proposed to the Communist group of the Congress that it pass a
    resolution putting central and local Proletcult organisations
    under the control of the People's Commissariat of Education. The
    resolution was in keeping with Lenin's ideas and was unanimously
    approved by the Congress. However, after the Congress, some
    Proletcult leaders began to voice disagreement with the resolution
    and misinterpreted it to the rank and file, alleging that the
    Central Committee of the Communist Party was hamstringing the
    workers in the sphere of the arts and aiming at dissolving
    Proletcult. The Central Committee of the Party refuted these
    demagogical insinuations in its letter "On Proletcult
    Organisations" which gave a detailed analysis of Proletcult
    mistakes. The letter was published in Pravda No. 270 on December
    1, 1920. 
[2]
    On October 8, 1920, Izvestia reported Lunacharsky as saying in his
    speech at the Proletcult Congress that Proletcult must be assured
    a special status and complete autonomy. Recalling this episode,
    Lunacharsky wrote in his reminiscences: “At the time oh the
    Proletcult Congress in October 1920, Vladimir Ilyich instructed me
    to attend it and pointed out quite definitely that Proletcult
    should be subordinated to the People's Commissariat of Education,
    should regard itself as one of its institutions, and so on. In
    short, he wanted us to bring Proletcult closer to the state. At
    the same time, he took steps to bring it closer to the Party. I
    spoke at the Congress in a rather non-committal and conciliatory
    way, and the version sent to Vladimir Ilyich was even milder. He
    summoned me and gave me a good talking-to.”

Comrades, allow me to speak on several ideas, some
    of which were dealt with by the Central Committee of the Communist
    Party and by the Council of People’s Commissars in
    connection with the formation of the Chief Committee for Political
    Education, while others came to me in connection with the draft
    submitted to the Council of People’s Commissars. This draft
    was adopted yesterday as a basis; its details have still to be
    discussed.
I shall permit myself only to say, for my part, that at first I
      was highly averse to any change in the name of your
      institution. In my opinion, the function of the People’s
      Commissariat of Education is to help people learn and 
      teach others. My Soviet experience has taught me to regard
      titles as childish jokes; after all, any title is a joke in its
      way. Another name has now been endorsed: the Chief Committee for
      Political Education.
As this matter has already been decided, you moist take this as
    nothing more than a personal remark. If the matter is not limited
    merely to a change of label, it is only to be welcomed.
If we succeed in drawing new people into cultural and
    educational work, it will not be just a change of title, and then
    we can reconcile ourselves to the “Soviet” weakness of
    sticking a label on every new undertaking and every new
    institution. If we succeed, we shall have achieved something more
    than ever before.
 The link between education and our policy should be the chief
    inducement in making people join us in our cultural and
    educational work. A title may express something if there is a need
    for it, for along the whole line of our educational work we have
    to abandon the old standpoint that education should be
    non-political; we cannot conduct educational work in isolation
    from politics.
That idea has always predominated in bourgeois society. The
    very term “apolitical” or “non-political”
    education is a piece of bourgeois hypocrisy, nothing but
    humbuggery practised on the masses, 99 per cent of whom are
    humiliated and degraded by the rule of the church, private
    property and the like. That, in fact, is the way the bourgeoisie,
    still in the saddle in all bourgeois countries, is deceiving the
    masses.
The greater the importance of a political apparatus in such
    countries, the less its independence of capital and its
    policy.
In all bourgeois states the connection between the political
    apparatus and education is very strong, although bourgeois society
    cannot frankly acknowledge it. Nevertheless, this society
    indoctrinates the masses through the church and the institution of
    private property.
It is one of our basic tasks to contrapose our own truth to
    bourgeois “truth”, and win its recognition.
The transition from bourgeois society to the policy of the
    proletariat is a very difficult one, all the more so for the
    bourgeoisie incessantly slandering us through its entire apparatus
    of propaganda and agitation. It bends every effort to play down an
    even more important mission of the dictatorship of the
    proletariat, its educational mission, which is particularly
    important in Russia, where the proletariat constitutes a minority
    of the population. Yet in Russia this mission must be given
    priority, for we must prepare the masses to build up
    socialism. The dictatorship of the proletariat would have been out
    of the question if, in the struggle against the bourgeoisie, the
    proletariat had not developed a keen class-consciousness, strict
    discipline and profound devotion, in other words, all the
    qualities required to assure the proletariat’s complete
    victory over its old enemy.
We do not hold the utopian view that the working masses are
    ready for a socialist society. From precise facts provided by the
    entire history of working-class socialism we know that this is not
    the case, and that preparedness for socialism is created only by
    large-scale industry, by the, strike struggle and by political
    organisation. To win the victory and accomplish the socialist
    revolution, the proletariat must be capable of concerted action,
    of overthrowing the exploiters. We now see that it has acquired
    all the necessary qualities, and that it translated them into
    action when it won power.
Education workers, and the Communist Party as the vanguard in
    the struggle, should consider it their fundamental task to help
    enlighten and instruct the working masses, in order to cast off
    the old ways and habituated routine we have inherited from the old
    system, the private property habits the masses are thoroughly
    imbued with. This fundamental task of the entire socialist
    revolution should never be neglected during consideration of the
    particular problems that have demanded so much attention from the
    Party’s Central Committee and the Council of People’s
    Commissars. What kind of structure should the Chief Committee for
    Political Education have? How should it be linked up with other
    institutions? How should it be linked up, not only with the centre
    but with local bodies? These questions will be answered by
    comrades who are more competent in the matter, have already gained
    considerable experience, and have made a special study of the
    matter. I would like merely to stress the main principles
    involved. We must put the matter frankly and openly affirm,
    despite all the old untruths, that education cannot but be linked
    up with politics.
We are living in an historic period of struggle against the
    world bourgeoisie, which is far stronger than we are. At this
    stage of the struggle, we have to safeguard the development of the
    revolution and combat the bourgeoisie in the military sense and
    still more by means of our ideology through education, so that the
    habits, usages and convictions acquired by the working class in
    the course of many decades of struggle for political liberty-the
    sum total of these habits, usages and ideasshould serve as an
    instrument for the education of all working people. It is for the
    proletariat to decide how the latter are to be educated. We must
    inculcate in the working people the realisation that it is
    impossible and inexcusable to stand aside in the
    proletariat’s struggle, which is now spreading more and more
    to all capitalist countries in the world, and to stand aside in
    international politics. An alliance of all the world’s
    powerful capitalist countries against Soviet Russia-such is the
    real basis of international politics today. And it must, after
    all, be realised that on this will depend the fate of hundreds of
    millions of working people in the capitalist countries. We know
    that, at the present moment, there is not a corner of the earth
    which is not under the control of a small group of capitalist
    countries. Thus the situation is shaping in such a way that one is
    faced with the alternative of standing aloof from the present
    struggle and thereby proving one’s utter lack of political
    consciousness, just like those benighted people who have held
    aloof from the revolution and, the war and do not see the
    bourgeoisie’s gross deception of the masses, the deliberate
    way in which the bourgeoisie is keeping the masses in ignorance;
    or else of joining the struggle for the dictatorship of the
    proletariat.
It is with absolute frankness that we speak of this struggle of
    the proletariat; each man must choose between joining our side or
    the other side. Any attempt to avoid taking sides in this issue
    must end in fiasco.
Observation of the many remnants of the Kerensky gang, the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Social-Democrats, as represented
    by the Yudeniches, Kolchaks, Petlyuras, Makhnos and others, has
    shown us such a variety of forms and shades of counter-revolution
    in various parts of Russia that we have every reason to consider
    ourselves far more steeled in the struggle than anybody else is. A
    glance at Western Europe shows the same thing happening there as
    in our country-a repetition of our own history. Almost everywhere
    elements similar to the Kerensky gang are to be met alongside the
    bourgeoisie. They predominate in a number of countries, especially
    Germany. One can see the same thing everywhere-the impossibility
    of taking an intermediate position, and a clear realisation that
    there must be either a whiteguard dictatorship (for which -the
    bourgeoisie of all the countries of Western Europe are preparing
    by arming against us), or the dictatorship of the proletariat. We
    have experienced this so acutely and profoundly that there is no
    need for me to talk at length about the Russian Communists. Hence
    there can be only a single conclusion, one that should be the
    corner-stone of all arguments and theories about the Chief
    Committee for Political Education: the primacy of the Communist
    Party’s policy must be frankly recognised in the work of
    that body. We know of no other form of guidance; and no other has
    been evolved in any country. Parties may represent the interests
    of their class in one degree or another; they may undergo changes
    or modifications, but we do not yet know of any better form. The
    entire course of the struggle waged by Soviet Russia, which for
    three years has withstood the onslaught of world imperialism, is
    bound up with the fact that the Party has consciously set out to
    help the proletariat perform its function of educator, organiser
    and leader, without which the collapse of capitalism is
    impossible. The working masses, the masses of peasants and
    workers, must oust the old intellectualist habits and re-educate
    themselves for the work of building communism. Otherwise the work
    of construction cannot be undertaken. Our entire experience shows
    that this is a very serious matter, and we must therefore give
    prominence to Party primacy and never lose sight of it when
    discussing our activities and our organisational development. How
    this is to be done will still have to be discussed at length; it
    will have to be discussed in the Party’s Central Committee
    and in the Council of People’s Commissars. The decree which
    was endorsed yesterday laid down the fundamentals in respect of
    the Chief Committee for Political Education, but it has not yet
    gone through all the stages in the Council of People’s
    Commissars. The decree will be published within the next few days,
    and you will see that its final form makes no direct mention of
    relations with the Party.
We must, however, know and remember that, in law and in
    practice, the Constitution of the Soviet Republic is based on the
    tenet that the Party rectifies, prescribes and builds according to
    a single principle-to enable the communist elements linked with
    the proletariat to imbue the proletariat with their own spirit,
    win its adherence, and open its eyes to the bourgeois deceit which
    we have been trying so long to eliminate. The People’s
    Commissariat of Education has gone through a long struggle; for a
    long time the teachers’ organisation resisted the socialist
    revolution. Bourgeois prejudices have struck very deep root among
    the teachers. There has been a long struggle in the form of direct
    sabotage and of tenacious bourgeois prejudices, and we have to
    fight for the communist positions slowly, step by step and win
    them. The Chief Committee for Political Education, which is
    concerned with extra-mural education, the work of educating and
    enlightening the masses, is faced with the clear task of combining
    Party leadership with the effort to gain the adherence of, to
    imbue with its spirit and to animate with its initiative, this
    half-million strong army of teachers, this vast institution which
    is now in the service of the workers. Education workers-the
    teachers-were trained in the spirit of bourgeois prejudices and
    habits, in a spirit hostile to the proletariat, with which they
    have had no ties whatever. We must now train a new army of
    teachers and instructors who must be in close touch with the Party
    and its ideas, be imbued with its spirit, and attract the masses
    of workers, instilling the spirit of communism into them and
    arousing their interest in what is being done by the
    Communists.
Since the old customs, habits and ideas must be discarded, the
    Chief Committee for Political Education and its personnel are
    faced with a most important task, which they must keep uppermost
    in their minds. Here we indeed have a dilemma: how can we
    establish a link between the teachers, most of whom are of the old
    school, with Party members, with the Communists? That is an
    extremely difficult problem, one that will require a considerable
    amount of thought.
Let us consider the means of establishing organisational links
    between people who are so different. In principle, we cannot for a
    moment doubt the need of the Communist Party’s
    primacy. Consequently, the purpose of political culture, of
    political instruction, is to train genuine Communists capable of
    stamping out falsehood and prejudices and helping the working
    masses to vanquish the old system and build up a state without
    capitalists, without exploiters, and without landowners. How can
    that be done? Only by acquiring the sum total of knowledge that
    the teachers have inherited from the bourgeoisie. Without this the
    technical achievements of communism will be impossible, and all
    hopes for those achievements would be pipe dreams. So the question
    arises: how are we to organise these people, who are not used to
    bringing politics into their work, especially the politics that is
    to our advantage, i.e., politics essential to communism? That, as
    I have said, is a very difficult problem. We have discussed the
    matter in the Central Committee, and in discussing it have tried
    to take into account the lessons of experience. We think that a
    congress like the one I am addressing today, a conference like
    yours, will be of great value in this respect. Every Party
    Committee now has to look from a new angle upon every
    propagandist, who used to be regarded merely as a man belonging to
    a definite circle, a definite organisation. Each of them belongs
    to a ruling party which directs the whole state, and the Soviet
    Russia’s world struggle against the bourgeois system. He is
    a representative of a fighting class and of a party which runs,
    and must run, an enormous machine of state. Many a Communist who
    has been through the splendid school of underground work and has
    been tested and steeled in the struggle is unwilling or unable to
    understand the full significance of this change, of this
    transition, which turns the agitator and propagandist into a
    leader of agitators, a leader in a huge political
    organisation. The kind of title he is given, even if it is an
    embarrassing one-such as superintendent of general schools-does
    not matter much; what is important is that he should be capable of
    directing the mass of teachers.
It should be said that the hundreds of thousands of teachers
    constitute a body that must get the work moving, stimulate
    thought, and combat the prejudices that to this day still persist
    among the masses. The heritage of capitalist culture, the fact
    that the mass of the teachers are imbued with its defects, which
    prevent them from being Communists, should not deter us from
    admitting these teachers into the ranks of the political education
    workers, for these teachers possess the knowledge without which we
    cannot achieve our aim.
 We must put hundreds of thousands of useful people to work in
    the service of communist education. That is a task that was
    accomplished at the front, in our Red Army, into which tens of
    thousands of representatives of the old army were incorporated. In
    the lengthy process of re-education, they became welded with the
    Red Army, as they ultimately proved by their victories. This is an
    example that we must follow in our cultural and educational
    work. True, this work is not so spectacular, but it is even more
    important. We need every agitator and propagandist; he will be
    doing his job if he works in a strictly Party spirit but at the
    same time does not limit himself to Party work, and remembers that
    it is his duty to direct hundreds of thousands of teachers, whet
    their interest, overcome their old bourgeois prejudices, enlist
    them in the work we are doing, and make them realise the immensity
    of our work. It is only by tackling that job that we can lead this
    mass of people, whom capitalism suppressed and drew away from us,
    along the right path.
Such are the aims that every agitator and propagandist working
    in the sphere of extra-mural education must pursue and constantly
    keep in sight. A host of practical difficulties will be
    encountered in the process, and you must help the cause of
    communism by becoming representatives and leaders, not only of
    Party study-circles, but of the entire state administration, which
    is now in the hands of the working class.
We must overcome resistance from the capitalists in all its
    forms, not only in the military and the political spheres, but
    also ideological resistance, which is the most deep-seated and the
    strongest. It is the duty of our educational workers to accomplish
    the re-education of the masses. The interest, the thirst for
    education and knowledge of communism which are to be seen among
    them are a guarantee of our victory in this field too, although,
    perhaps, not as rapid as at the front and only after great
    difficulties and at times even reverses. However, we shall
    ultimately win.
Last, I should like to dwell on one more point. Perhaps the
    title of Chief Committee for Political Education is not properly
    understood. Inasmuch as it makes mention of the political concept,
    politics is the main thing here.
But how is politics to be understood? If politics is understood
    in the old sense, one may fall into a grave and profound
    error. Politics means a struggle between classes; means the
    relations of the proletariat in its struggle for its emancipation,
    against the world bourgeoisie. However, in our struggle two
    aspects of the matter stand out: on the one hand, there is the
    task of destroying the heritage of the bourgeois system, of
    foiling the repeated attempts of the whole bourgeoisie to crush
    the Soviet state. This task has absorbed most of our attention
    hitherto and has prevented us from proceeding to the other task,
    that of construction. According to the bourgeois world outlook,
    politics was divorced, as it were, from economics. The bourgeoisie
    said: peasants, you must work for your livelihood; workers, you
    must work to secure your means of subsistence on the market; as
    for economic policy, that is the business of your masters. That,
    however, is not so; politics should be the business of the people,
    the business of the proletariat. Here we must emphasise the fact
    that nine-tenths of our time and our work is devoted to the
    struggle against the bourgeoisie. The victories over Wrangel, of
    which we read yesterday, and of which you will read today and
    probably tomorrow, show that one stage of the struggle is coming
    to an end and that we have secured peace with a number of Western
    countries; every victory on the war front leaves our hands freer
    for the internal struggle, for the politics of state
    organisation. Every step that brings us closer to victory over
    the whiteguards gradually shifts the focus of the struggle to
    economic policy. Propaganda of the old type describes and
    illustrates what communism is. This kind of propaganda is now
    useless, for we have to show in practice how socialism is to be
    built. All our propaganda must be based on the political
    experience of economic development. That is our principal task;
    whoever interprets it in the old sense will show himself to be a
    retrograde, one who is incapable of conducting propaganda work
    among the masses of the peasants and workers. Our main policy must
    now be to develop the state economically, so as to gather in more
    poods of grain and mine more poods of coal, to decide how best to
    utilise these poods of grain and coal and preclude starvation-that
    is our policy. All our agitation and propaganda must be focussed
    on this aim. There must be less fine talk, for you cannot satisfy
    the working people with fine words. As soon as the war enables us
    to shift the focus from the struggle against the bourgeoisie, from
    the struggle against Wrangel and the whiteguards, we shall turn to
    economic policy. And then agitation and propaganda will play a
    role of tremendous and ever growing importance.
Every agitator must be a state leader, a leader of all the
    peasants and workers in the work of economic development. He must
    tell them what one should know, what pamphlets and books one
    should read to become a Communist.
That is the way to improve our economic life and make it more
    secure, more social; that is the way to increase production,
    improve the food situation and distribution of the goods produced,
    increase coal output, and restore industry without capitalism and
    without the capitalist spirit.
What does communism consist in? All propaganda for communism
    must be conducted in a way that will amount to practical guidance
    of the state’s development. Communism must be made
    comprehensible to the masses of the workers so that they will
    regard it as their own cause. That task is being poorly
    accomplished, and thousands of mistakes are being made. We make no
    secret of the fact. However, the workers and the peasants must
    themselves build up and improve our apparatus, with our
    assistance, feeble and inadequate as it is. To us, that is no
    longer a programme, a theory, or a task to be accomplished; it has
    become a matter of actual and practical development. Although we
    suffered some cruel reverses in our war, we have at least learnt
    from these reverses and won complete victory. Now, too, we must
    learn a lesson from every defeat and must remember that the
    workers and peasants have to be instructed by taking the work
    already performed as an example. We must point out what is bad, so
    as to avoid it in future.
By taking constructive work as an example, by repeating it time
    and again, we shall succeed in turning inefficient communist
    managers into genuine builders, and, in the first place, into
    builders of our economic life. We shall achieve our targets and
    overcome all the obstacles which we have inherited from the old
    system and cannot be eliminated at a single stroke. We must
    re-educate the masses; they can be re-educated only by agitation
    and propaganda. The masses must be brought, in the first place,
    into the work of building the entire economic life. That must be
    the principal and basic object in the work of each agitator and
    propagandist, and when he realises this, the success of his work
    will be assured. (Loud applause.)

Reply To The Debate On The Report

 On Concessions Delivered To The R.C.P.(B.) Group

 At The Eighth Congress Of Soviets 
December 21
Comrades, I have received quite a few notes and shall briefly
answer those to which no replies have yet been given. But first let me read
to you a note of an informative nature, which I think is characteristic: 


At the Arzamas uyezd congress, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, a
   non-Party peasant declared the following concerning concessions, which we
   communicate to you as a characteristic sign: “Comrades, we are
   delegating you to the All-Russia Congress and declare that we, peasants,
   are prepared to endure hunger and cold and do our duty for another three
   years but don’t sell Mother-Russia in the form of
   concessions!” 

I think it would be very useful to quote this note in the official report
to the

      Congress,[1]

and it ought to be done because it shows a side of the question which the
capitalists overlook, and in connection with which we have no need whatever
to conceal the fact that there is a danger here, and we have to be on our
guard against it. I have already mentioned that these reminders sharpen the
attention of the workers and peasants. The fact that such reminders are
coming from the midst of the illiterate peasantry is of special importance,
as it stresses a task which is of exceptional

    

importance at the present time-1 mean about your having to examine the
bills tabled in the Council of People’s Commissars for rendering
assistance to peasant farming. We must learn to convince the non-Party
peasants, win them over to our side and make them self-dependent. A note
like this shows that we have every chance of achieving tremendous success
here, and we shall achieve it. 

Here is another note: 


Won’t the capitalist concessionaires set the proletarian masses
   against the Soviet government, seeing that the economic crisis and chaos we
   are living through make it impossible for us to satisfy the needs of the
   workers the way the capitalists can? 


I have said already that in the advanced countries, in most of them,
the workers are better provided for than ours, yet the Russian workers in
all the advanced countries are all eagerness to come to Soviet Russia,
although they are well aware of the hardships the workers have to
bear. 


Won’t the Russian Ryabushinskys and the rest of the
   pack put in an appearance together with the English and American
   capitalists? 


This has a bearing on the note which asks whether the concessionaires
will be exterritorial. Of course not, we shall never grant them
exterritoriality. This is granted only to ambassadors, and even then on
definite conditions. If Ryabushinsky banks on hiding himself from the
proper authorities, I think he is mistaken. 

Next, comrades, I want to tell you that Comrade Lezhava reports:
“Vanderlip has presented a mandate from about a dozen big
syndicates. This has been verified by our special authorities here. It has
already been corroborated by Krasin in London, who has checked up on the
seriousness of the groups for whom Vanderlip is acting.” 

For the benefit of those comrades who ask why the agreement has not
been published, I repeat that its publication is not to our advantage,
because the capitalists, who are fighting among themselves, think there are
far worse things in that agreement. The hullabaloo about it in the press
bears this out. Let them go on believing it, we have no intention whatever
of disillusioning them. Those who wish to familiarise themselves with this
agreement have every possibility of doing so. Besides, 1 mentioned that
the agreement

    

will come into force after the new president of the United States
of America has been sworn in. Our Party congress will be held in

February.[3] Consequently, the Party will have every opportunity of
controlling and deciding things. 


Please explain, if you can, for how long Kamchatka has
   been let (or is proposed to be let) and is there an economic, apart from a
   political, advantage in this for the R.S.F.S.R. and in what form? 


Kamchatka has not been let and cannot be let until March. The economic
gain is that according to the draft agreement they are obliged to give us a
share of the mineral wealth which they will extract. 


In granting concessions do we not thereby admit the durability of the
   capitalist states and do we not consider our thesis concerning the
   earliness of .a world revolution to be incorrect? 


Bukharin has replied to this. It is not a question of our admitting
their durability; the point is that gigantic forces are driving them to the
brink. Our existence and speedy release from the critical situation and
famine are a gigantic force and a factor of revolution more powerful than
those farthings—a mere crumb from the point f view of world economy-which
they will get from us. An extra hundred or thousand machines and
locomotives are of tremendous importance to us, for it will mean that
transport repairs, which Trotsky planned over a period of four and a half
years and reduced to three and a half, will be reduced by another
year. Reducing the economic chaos and famine by a year is of colossal
importance to us. 


What if Japan, to prevent us letting Kamchatka to
   America, goes and occupies it with her troops and declares it her own? 


As a matter of fact she is in possession of Kamchatka right now, and if
she could she would do it, but she can’t because she is afraid of
America. 


Where will the capitalist get his labour force? Will he
   bring it with him? Hardly. If he is going to employ Russian workers, not
   only will these be under the thumb of the capitalist, but it will upset our
   labour market, and this, in turn, will upset our integrated economic
   plan. 

I can’t see how our economic plan will be upset by our workers
going there to work. They won’t be able to go there

    

apart from the trade unions, apart from our economic organisations and our
Party. The workers at the advanced capitalist enterprises will train our
workers in the best methods of production. In submitting to capitalist
conditions of work, our workers will subordinate them to our code of labour
laws or to special restrictive agreements, and will not hesitate to quit if
the conditions are bad. If the conditions are unfavourable, the workers
will quit. Some comrades are afraid that the conditions will be good,
others, that they will be bad. We shall look out, just like our workers and
peasants, and take proper measures. 


In granting concessions, when the concessionaires start
   working, will the activities of the R.C.P. in organising communist cells
   among those employed on the concession territory be open or only illegal?
   


Here is a wrong idea of concessions and concessionaires. The,
concessionaire is not an authority. He does not get any territory other
than that to be used for economic exploitation. All government bodies and
all courts of law remain only in the hands of the R.S.F.S.R. 


Should unemployment in America force a revolution,
   won’t our concessions be helping America to cope with this crisis,
   that is, hold up the revolution. 


That argument has been disproved by Comrade Bukharin. 


If the international bourgeoisie gets to know of the
   Soviet government’s tactics in concessions, what will the position
   of the Soviet government be? Won’t this be bad for us? 


On the contrary, everyone in Europe has heard about the concessions,
and the hullabaloo about it there only goes to show that the bourgeoisie is
worried. They are anxious not to be late. All those capitalists who do not
want to risk having dealings with Russia are now beginning to realise that
they are lagging behind while the more enterprising people are getting
in. And we are taking advantage of the contradictions among the
capitalists. 


Are there any plans or projects for concessions on large
   industrial enterprises in Moscow and in the centre generally? There is talk
   about three such concessions in Moscow, Yaroslavl and Lubertsi. 

I know nothing about such concessions. There is an American factory in
Lubertsi which has not been nationalised

    

and never was, but there is no concession there. The only concession in the
centre, which the S.E.C. comrades have spoken of as being possible, is a
concession to the German chemists for developing dye works and letting one
factory to them. In the Council of People’s Commissars all were
agreed it was possible, but this talk has had no practical
consequences. 

Germany is so far ahead of our country that during the imperialist war
even the advanced countries found them-selves in difficulties when the
German chemical industry stopped supplying them. To get our chemical
industry going we must be prepared to pay the German chemists well. The
best way to learn is to grant the Germans a con-cession on one of our
factories. No schools or lectures will help as much as practical work at a
factory, where the workers can be trained in six months and then made to
build another factory like it next door. To fear that the Germans of a
single factory will do something to us, considering their international
situation, is ridiculous. There were no differences of opinion in the
C.P.C. In point of principle it is acceptable. Unfortunately, this question
has not had practical results. I must stress the fact that we talk a great
deal about concessions, but so far we have not succeeded in granting a
single one. We shall consider it a great success if we manage to grant at
least one, and you will see the concrete conditions of the concession. 

Further. 


What countries can be granted concessions? Can we give a
   concession to Poland? 


We believe they can be granted to all countries, Poland included. 


Couldn’t the capitalists use the concessions to
   avert
   crises at home and thus stave off a social revolution? 


If the capitalists could avert crises at home, then capitalism would
he everlasting. They are decidedly blind pawns in the general mechanism-the
imperialist war has shown that. Every month proves that the crisis of
capitalism is deepening, disintegration throughout the world is spreading
farther and farther, and Russia is the only country where

    

an upswing towards a durable and serious improvement has started. 


To sow dissension among the workers the concessionaires
   may place their workers in better conditions. 


This won’t increase dissension among our people, we have grown
  ;much
stronger. 


Will trade union groups be organised on the
   concessionaire’s territory? 


The concessionaires get economic exploitation, the authorities and laws
remain Soviet ones. 


Can you outline the conditions guaranteeing us against
   the danger of the Soviet state system being distorted and a capitalist
   set-up being introduced? 


These conditions are the laws of the R.S.F.S.R. If a contracting party
breaks them we have the right to cancel the agreement. 


What is the gist of the tentative draft agreement with
   the American imperialists covering a concession on Kamchatka? 


I said that the term of the concession is 50-60 years. We get a share
of the produce, they the right to set up a military and naval base at the
inlet near which there is an oil deposit. 


You say that granting concessions to the capitalists of
   oppressed countries like Germany is more important than for other
   countries. But if the capitalists of oppressed countries use the
   concessions to improve their country’s economic position, don’t you think
   this will stave off the revolution in that country? 


The international situation as regards revolution revolves around
Soviet Russia’s struggle against the rest of the world, the capitalist
countries. To strengthen Soviet Russia and make her invincible-that is what
matters most as far as the struggle of the oppressed and colonial countries
is concerned. 


What role in concessions does Turkestan cotton play? 


So far there is no question of granting a concession on Turkestan
cotton. This question was not discussed. 


Will concessions be granted for the rehabilitation of industrial
   enterprises and for taking over railways? 

 

Such exigencies are ruled out. The railways are a single integrated
enterprise. 


Has there been any question of concessions on slaughter-houses? 


Not that I have heard of. 


The protests against concessions in the local areas stand
   clearly revealed, not as healthy sentiments at all, but as patriotic
   feeling among a strong petty-bourgeois section of the countryside and among
   the urban middle classes. 


The patriotism of a person who is prepared to go hungry for three years
rather than surrender Russia to foreigners is genuine patriotism, without
which we could not hold out for three years. Without this patriotism we
would not have succeeded in defending the Soviet Republic, in doing away
with private property and now getting as much as 300 million poods by means
of the food surplus-appropriation system. This is the finest revolutionary
patriotism. As for the kulaks being prepared to go hungry for three years
to keep out the foreign capitalists, from whom they have something to
gain-that is untrue. It is not the kulaks who are concerned, it is the
non-Party middle peasant. 


Isn’t there a risk that in view of a possible war between
   America and Japan there is a likelihood of a serious attack on Soviet
   Russia by Japan? What shall we do then? Shall we fight off Japan in
   alliance with imperialist America, using her assistance as a real force?
   


Of course we shall-we have often said that an alliance with one
imperialist state against another to consolidate the socialist republic is
not objectionable in point of principle. An attack by Japan on Soviet
Russia is much more difficult now than it was a year ago. 


Please explain the Allies’ policy towards Turkey and our
   relation-ships. 


It is rather awkward, of course, to deal openly with this question in
an official speech, as relations here are extremely confused. Everything
here depends on the intricate play of relations in bourgeois Georgia,
which is on the verge of catastrophe. The comrades who are interested in
this will, I am sure, derive great benefit from the report by Comrade
Meshcheryakov, Editor of Pravda, who has returned from Georgia, where he
spent several weeks, if not

    

months, and has collected highly interesting material on this Menshevik
realm. Georgia is on the verge of disaster. The Turkish attack was planned
against us. The Allies were making a pitfall for us, but fell into it
themselves, because we have received Soviet Armenia. 

The men at the top in Turkey are Cadets, Octobrists, Nationalists, who
are prepared to sell us to the Allies. But that is an extremely difficult
thing to do, because feeling among the Turkish people against the savage
oppression by the Allies is running very high, and sympathy towards Soviet
Russia is growing in proportion as we help the independent Azerbaijan
Republic to carry out proper liberation of the Moslem peasants, who have
driven out the landowners, but are afraid to take the land, and will
shortly stop being afraid; when they do take the land the Turkish landowner
won’t last long. 

We personally have been and will be peaceful in the extreme in the
Caucasus, and for the information of our Caucasian comrades, we shall be
very careful to avoid anything that may involve us in war. Our peaceful
policy so far has been so felicitous, that the Allies are getting nervous,
have started taking decisive steps against us, but are only getting them
against themselves. 


What is going to happen next to Georgia? 


Even the Mohammedan Allah doesn’t know that, but if we show
self-restraint we have something to gain without running any risk. 

We are asked whether there were any other concession objects besides
Kamchatka. There have been no other concessions with Vanderlip. 

Regarding press hand-outs. We can’t do that, first because the
printing-works are busy, and secondly so as not to make this material
available to people abroad, where there is a desire to torpedo this
undertaking of ours. So far we haven’t got a single concession, a single
agreement, and we must first get an agreement before speaking about
dangers. We have nothing so far and are acting semi-legally. 


How will things stand with concessions and with works and
   buildings erected by concessionaires in the event of a) their violating
   the laws of the R.S.F.S.R. b) war breaking out with a country of which the
   concessionaire is a subject, and c) with others? 

 

In the event of an agreement being violated the concessionaire will be
prosecuted under the laws of the R.S.F.S.R. In the event of war the
concession agreement is broken and the property passes into the possession
of the R.SF.S.R. in accordance with military procedure. 


The Russian bourgeoisie, who have escaped abroad, will be
   able to take part in the exploitation of concessions with their
   capital. Won’t this lead to the old bosses coming back under the guise of
   foreign capital? 


If an old boss takes a ride through the northern forests of European
Russia under the guise of foreign capital we have nothing to fear. You will
find many an old boss in the centre of Moscow. We have a thousand times
less reason to fear a situation in which we shall have a list of all
visiting foreigners, than those bosses who are operating at our
enterprises and who, unfortunately, have not been registered yet. 


You have pointed out and underlined the political
   significance of concessions. That is understandable. But what the provinces
   are most worried about is this: with concessions there will be trade
   relations. What threats and dangers to the Republic does this imply in the
   sense of disintegration and the blowing up of the Soviet system from within
   (perhaps increased profiteering, etc.) and what precautions can we take
   against it? 


I have already spoken about that. We had a tremendous threat of
profiteering in the shape of

Sukharevka,[4] with which we waged a constant
struggle. We understand, of course, that with the abolition of Sukharevka
profiteering still remains, it remains wherever there is a small
proprietor, and we have tens of millions of such proprietors. That is where
the real danger lies, and not in big capital, which will be hedged around
on all sides with special supervisions. It should not be forgotten that we
shall have an agreement which we can always cancel at the risk-our greatest
danger-of having to pay damages. 


What is the position with regard to tsarist debts? Will
   the Allies agree to any transactions unless these debts are paid? 


England already agrees not to demand the debts from us, since we have
proposed the draft of a trade agreement to them. Under that draft trade
deals are now starting and under it we are not obliged to repay debts. I
say, England agrees, but France does not. And so we tell France that in

    

principle we do not refuse. The exact amounts of payments will be discussed
at a conference, at which we intend to say: you, too, are responsible for
the losses you have caused us by your intervention. An ad hoc commission is
working on this question, and an initial estimate puts the figure at ten
thousand million in gold.

Speech To The R.C.P.(B.) Group

 At The Eighth Congress Of Soviets

 During The Debate

 On The Report

 Of The All-Russia Central Executive Committee

 And The Council Of People’s Commissars

 Concerning Home And Foreign Policies 
December 22

Comrades, allow me to begin by touching on certain remarks
made by speakers and answering notes, at least the more important
ones. From Comrade Korzinov’s criticism I have picked out the idea
concerning engineers and agronomists. We must push forward with the
training of engineers and agronomists from among the workers and
peasants. This is beyond all question, and the Soviet government is taking
steps in this direction, but we cannot count on very quick results; it may
not take as long as electrification, but it will take at least several
years; so it is wrong of Comrade Korzinov to suggest that all other matters
be set aside until we have our own agronomists. Bight now we have got to
find and get the best agronomists, call them to our meetings, demand from
them an account and thus single out the industrious and educated men from
the rest. 

Comrade Korzinov has landed in the opposition for opposition’s sake
when he says that the decree on concessions should have been published
earlier. But our work at the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council
of Labour and Defence is such that we have to react at once, and the

    

position with us is such that, given no differences of opinion in the
C.C. and C.P.C., decisions are taken at once. If the decree on concessions
is

wrong,[5] then we should propose its repeal, because the chief
concession with Vanderlip will not become a formal agreement until next
March. 

At the time we published this decree our main purpose was, and still
remains, to conclude a trade agreement as quickly as possible and offer the
bait of concessions to the capitalists. I dealt with this political aspect
of the case in my report to the R.C.P. group and heard no objections at the
time. I was therefore surprised when Comrade Ignatov, bent on being
opposition-minded, said that we had slipped up on Vanderlip, that we hadn’t
found out who he was. I read the statement by the Deputy People’s Commissar
for Foreign Trade that all inquiries concerning the group Vanderlip
represented had been made, had been confirmed abroad and remained
unrefuted. Vanderlip himself had pointed out that no agreement could be
concluded until after the presidential elections, when the Republican
candidate would take office, since such an agreement would have to be
sanctioned by the American Government. 

This is an agreement under which the American Government is to receive
a naval base. Consequently, even if this Washington Vanderlip, about whom
Comrade Ryazanov went into such irrelevant details-as often happens with
him-even if he did represent nobody and was just a swindler and the
proposed agreement was to provide for the Government of the United States
receiving a naval base aimed against Japan, there could be no question of
our being swindled, as the President of the United States would really be a
member of the Republican party. After Vanderlip we shall be in a position
to form a conclusive opinion about this trade agreement. Ignatov’s entire
criticism falls to the ground; he simply did not pay attention to what was
said at our meeting. 

Comrade Korzinov said that in the matter of Poland we should have given
warning earlier. We have here an extremely difficult situation, and there
was a moment when our troops were on the move and the Central Committee had
reason to believe that despite the complicated situation we could achieve
much by launching an offensive. 
 
At such a time when, after Curzon’s Note of

July 11,[6] we had to give a reply within a few days, how could we be
expected to call Party meetings to discuss the matter? Besides, every
comrade knows that if we could have passed over to an offensive war at the
right moment we would have done so without hesitation. And there would
never have been any opposition to it anywhere. What we did see was an
opposition in reverse, when we were accused of not pursuing a sufficiently
active foreign policy. That there have been mistakes here, there is no
doubt, but neither is there any doubt that arguing about them would be a
sheer waste of time, as we have other things to think of besides our old
activities. When time has receded, when all the documents and material will
have been collected, we shall be able to fully appreciate our
mistake. Therefore, I see nothing, absolutely nothing, in Comrade
Korzinov’s speech other than a desire to seek opposition. At another time,
when we are in more favourable conditions, we shall make the same use of
our successes. And so long as the Party does not forbid it, we shall always
assume the offensive. I don’t think that the Party or any of its members
will propose a reverse policy at any meeting. 

In regard to Comrade Gusev’s remark, I must say that I made a mistake
in introducing polemics in an official report, and therefore I have already
suggested that this part of the report be deleted from the official text
and greetings to Soviet Armenia added-through an unforgivable oversight on
my part this was omitted in the report. 

Comrade Gusev is wrong in saying that I boasted of my modesty-the point
is that in passing over to a more serious practical integration of the
economic commissariats and the implementation of a single economic plan,
the thing we had to be afraid of was project-mongering. 

Comrade Gusev says that I did not criticise his

booklet[7] as a whole. But that is the central point: Comrade Trotsky
and Comrade Rykov are invited to drop the departments and join the Council
of Defence, which, not being a depart-mental body, will set up a new
apparatus of its own. I cannot understand how, after three years of Soviet
rule, one can raise and support such a question here. I am at a loss for
words to express my perplexity. It is so ill-advised, it

    

means knocking down the department in one place and
setting it up in another. It means failure to understand what our apparatus
is. I don’t know whether Comrade Popov has managed to print the leaflet he
gave me. It contains an extract from the 1920 census results. You know that
this census has been satisfactorily carried out and has yielded a mass of
valuable information concerning the number of Soviet office employees in
Moscow. We took a similar census before this in 1919, but now we have a
fuller one. It shows that we have no less than 230,000 office employees, of
which 30,000, or even more, are in the most important commissariats, and
70,000 in the Moscow

Soviet.[8] Try to imagine these figures, ponder over them, and then
you will say to yourself-well, if you take an influential man, one who
enjoys the greatest authority and has created a certain style of work in
his department, take him out of that department and put him in charge of
several united departments, you can expect nothing but chaos. Is that the
way to fight bureaucratism? It is simply a frivolous attitude towards the
work, absolutely unrealistic. I understand what a serious thing
bureaucratism is, but no provision for its abolition is made in the Party
Programme. It is not a problem for a congress, it is a problem for a whole
epoch, and you have a special report devoted to this question. 

Does anyone really believe that by a mere stroke of the pen, by taking
comrades, who have created the best form of organisation in one or another
of the most important departments, and transferring them to the Council of
Labour and Defence, you will be getting a new department with indefinite
powers that will not perform economically unifying functions. When the
practical question arose in the Council of Labour and Defence as to what
was economic and what was not, not only the Foreign Trade Commissariat, but
the Finance Commissariat as well claimed that it was an economic
commissariat. And can you conduct any economic work without the
Commissariat for Public Health. Of course, when we shall have made big
progress in economic reconstruction the relation of economic commissariats
to non-economic ones may become different after we have achieved important
successes in the work of changing our economic foundations. At present we
have nothing of

    

the kind. Therefore, to treat the departmental question as
lightly as Gusev does-in other parts of the booklet, by the way, he repeats
some of the excellent ideas expressed in his previous

booklet[9]—is absolutely wrong. 

I shall say nothing about Ryazanov’s speech, which has been
sufficiently refuted by Kamenev. I shall merely mention that both Ryazanov
and Gusev, who has followed his bad example, have been talking about having
heard, perhaps from me in the Council of People’s Commissars, that I wanted
to, one said drown myself, the other said shoot myself. If comrades are
going to take a man at his angry word, uttered when he is very tired, and
make him speak about it before an audience of a thousand, I don’t think
these people can expect their speeches to be taken seriously. (


Applause.)  

It’s quite possible that we have a lot of vermicelli affairs in the
Council of People’s Commissars-that’s true. If Maximovsky has made this an
object on which to display his oppositionist bent and made a special point
of it, I must say there is not and cannot be any government institution
which does not have to deal with vermicelli affairs. You omitted to mention
that the C.C. dealt with questions involving policy. So long as the ruling
Party governs, so long as this Party has to decide all questions concerned
with various appointments, you will not allow important state appointments
to be made by anyone but the ruling party. When all is said and done, the
question of who is to make this or that policy is of secondary
importance. Hasn’t the C. C. vermicelli affairs? Plenty of them. Aren’t
there agendas, on completing which and running through a dozen items of
business, you would not only say you’d be glad to drown yourself, but
something worse still. I repeat, to catch me at this sort of statement is
not very difficult, but to come out here and make it an object for an
oppositionist stand and speak against vermicellism is frivolous. 

If, in a body which in general establishes only principles, we
attempted to set up a separate body to deal with petty, practical,
vermicelli affairs, we would only make things worse. Because we would be
tearing generalisation away from the facts of life, and such a break would
be sheer day-dreaming and frivolity. Questions in the Central Committee

    

cannot be divided into questions of principle and trivial questions,
because in every trifle a principle may be involved. 

It is not a question of Ivan or Sidor. It is not a question of putting
Sidor in Ivan’s place or vice versa. What if they refuse? What if this Ivan
and Sidor are both people’s commissars—what’s to be done then? The
C.C. has a Secretariat, an Orgbureau, a Politbureau, finally, plenums of
the Central Committee are held, and very often questions come before the
Central Committee Plenum that are as trivial and tedious as anything, and
some that you sit over for several hours until you feel like drowning
yourself. But to draw a line between trivial questions and questions of
principle is to undermine the very foundation of democratic centralism. At
the same time it cannot be said that the Central Committee dumps its
vermicelli onto other institutions. So far we have not been able to alter
the Constitution and have been working autonomously. The fact that on some
questions we have arrived at a agreement and on others there have been
debates is only natural and inevitable, considering the apparatus we
have. The fact that the C.C. is becoming an organ of control, and that in
the general distribution of work it has fallen to Comrade Kalinin to
supervise agitation and verification, and that he is required to give his
personal impressions obtained during his trips and at work—this gives no
grounds for shouting about the Council of People’s Commissars referring all
questions to the C.C and vice versa. It means introducing further
confusion and turmoil while things remain essentially unchanged. The
higher bodies are needed for the purpose of control and for turning down
certain questions. 

People here have spoken and complained about the Presidium of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee being swamped with business, and
though it is our highest body, it is swamped with purely vermicelli
affairs. But I would ask all those present here, how many of you have read
a dozen reports of our proceedings? Who has read them from beginning to
end? Probably no one, because they are dull, you can’t wade through them. I
must say that every member of our Party and every citizen of the Republic
has a right to bring any question, any circumstance, however trivial,
before the All-Russia Central Executive Committee. This

    

question will go through the whole ladder, through the bureau, etc. till it
gets to the C.E.C. Presidium, where it will be examined. And so it will be
until the complete communist re-education of the working people, which will
come within several decades after electrification has been finally
completed. In this respect we are not afraid of changes. 

I shall now deal with some of the notes. Comrade Minkin writes: 


Did Comrade Shlyapnikov inform the Council of People’s
   Commissars of the disgraceful goings on at the Commissariat for Foreign
   Trade, or was this being kept for announcement at the Congress? If he did
   make such a statement, what has been done to eliminate them? 


To answer this question I consulted Comrade Serebryakov who is better
informed than I am. He was appointed by the Central Committee to the
commission, the other members of which were Dzerzhinsky, Krestinsky and
Lezhava, set up to take steps towards improving the relations between the
Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the Commissariat for Internal Affairs,
since our representatives abroad had information that these relations were
anything but satisfactory. At my request Serebryakov gives the following
answer to the note of delegate Minkin: “Comrade Minkin states ...”
(reads). 

After this commission a subcommission was set up. It is very easy to
play at opposition, since there are disgraceful goings on with us in every
commissariat, and the infelicitous mention of guarantees and 30,000
employees in the commissariat’s technical publishing house is very
characteristic in the sense that you can always find scandalously
disgraceful things here. You will find the same thing in any division of
the Red Army. Nevertheless our Red Army has been winning victories all the
time. 

The thing is to apply in good time to the institution that has to
remedy matters, and not talk about it here, where we cannot collect
accurate information about what Comrade Ryazanov has heard of this or that
person and has not checked it or discovered the true facts. Is that
democratic centralism? It is not at all democratic, and not at all
centralism, but disorder and the introduction of chaos. Complaints should
be lodged with Party bodies. If that

    

body does not fulfil its duty it should be made to give a strict account of
itself. 

Among the notes that have been sent up there is the question of
reducing the army. On this subject Comrade Trotsky will make a special
statement, and you will decide whether this question should be dealt with
today or at the next special meeting of the R.C.P. group. I can tell you
that after an ad hoc commission on demobilisation headed by Trotsky and
Dzerzhinsky was set up, the C.C. decided to start demobilisation, and this
is now going on. It is being dealt with by the military department, and you
will receive an exact report. 


Is the Council of Labour and Defence regarded as an
   interim body called upon to unite the economic commissariats and then to be
   abolished, or i it the basis of a future integrated economic plan? Also, on
   what apparatus does the Council rely locally? 


This question has not been settled, and we believe that to raise it now
would be a waste of time. The order of the day now is a check-up of the
organisation of the commissariats. The Council of People’s Commissars has
set up an organisational body which is to revise the apparatus of the
People’s Commissariats with a view to the tasks confronting them, and in
this connection, to examine the question of staffs. To busy ourselves at
the present time with setting up another apparatus in place of the Council
of Labour and Defence is impossible until the question of electrification
is settled. Various material on electrification will soon be handed out to
you, and the Council of Labour and Defence will have to reckon with what
the verification of this material and the reports will have to say. We now
have an organ that we need, and, good or bad, we have in any case been
working with it and coping with the tasks confronting us. We have no
intention of embarking on reforms until we have practically tested how the
integrated economic plan will be carried out. This is definitely a case of
look before you leap. 


Who is going to conclude concession contracts in the Far
   East, we or the buffer state, in either case—why? 


This, comrades, is a delicate question. Buffer

state[10]—it is such an embarrassing definition when we are asked:

    

You or the buffer? On the one hand we have the buffer, on the other, the
corresponding Party Bureau of the R.C.P. The buffer’s a buffer, it’s to
enable us to win time and then beat the Japanese. I don’t know whom
Kamchatka belongs to. Actually the Japanese are in possession, and they do
not relish the idea of our giving it away to the Americans. We, are
consulted, our directives are complied with, and nobody has protested
against our negotiations with Vanderlip, no single group of Party comrades
has considered the question important enough to demand its being discussed
at the plenum of the Central Executive Committee and examined in the
Control Commission. This is the right of every Party member, and no one has
used this right. The person who has learned the facts which led to the
postponement of an agreement till March will not try to make use of this
right. 


What is your view of the trade unions at the present
   moment in connection with the concessions? Is it true that you stand for
   the organisation of a trade union of peasants? 


I must say that the Party’s Programme mentions the necessity of seeking
new forms of trade unions that would unite the poor sections of the

peasantry.[11] This task has been posed in the Party’s
Programme and I have often pointed out that although we are not in a
position at present to solve this problem, we must not give it up. We must
not confine ourselves to the work of

Vserabotzem,[12] which is so weak, and which cannot give us outstanding
workers. So long as we have a levelling process taking place among the
peasantry, a levelling and unification of the working peasants, the
non-kulak section of the peasantry, this problem cannot be removed from the
order o the day of socialist construction. To strengthen the work of the
trade unions we must extend them not only to the rural proletariat, but to
all the working peasantry. How this is to be done we do not know yet. We
have set this task in the Party’s Programme, we shall return to it many
times and get it settled in a practical manner from different aspects. That
is all I can say now on this question. 

With the granting of concessions, the trade unions, naturally, will
have important tasks imposed upon them-those

    

or checking, supervising, and maintaining contact with the workers who will
be employed in these concessions. How this task will be handled in
practice, I cannot say at the moment. To raise this question at the present
time would be inadvisable, as the trade unions have more important tasks
facing them. 

In our fight against bureaucratism we certainly need the help of the
trade unions. We must rely on them. This is basically provided for in the
Party’s

Programme.[13] This shows what a long struggle is needed and what
systematic work faces us. When we shall have data that in such-and-such a
workmen’s settlement the business of supervision is organised in
such-and-such a way and definite results have been achieved, while in
such-and-such a block, uyezd, etc. things are different-then we shall be
able to weigh things, get them moving, and there will not only be talk
about the “agitpotato” but we shall be in a position to check what steps
have been taken in practice and on this ground apply practical measures
that have already yielded results.

Speech On Addenda To The Bill Of The C.P.C.

 “On Measures To Consolidate And Develop

 Peasant Farming”

 Delivered To The B.C.?. Group

 Of The Eighth Congress Of Soviets 
December 27

Comrades, the Central Committee today has examined the decision adopted
by the group concerning the deletion of the words “individual
householders” from the point of the resolution on agriculture which deals
with improvement and premiums. The C.C. has passed the following resolution
and authorised me to defend

it.[14] (Reads.) There, comrades, you have the text of
the C.C.’s decision. Allow me now to

    

give the reasons why we simply could not agree with the group’s
decision. We had no doubts, and this was particularly stressed at the
C.C. meeting, that the principal reasons the group was guided by in its
decision to reject the idea of premiums for individual householders were
the fear that we would give premiums to the kulak, and the desire to give
priority to the village commune, the volost, the collective unit—to
common labour, not the individual. With this we are in perfect
agreement. We consider, however, that it would be wrong to let ourselves
reject altogether the idea of premiums for individual farmers for reasons,
which in themselves are quite correct, fundamentally indisputable to any
Marxist and especially valuable from the point of view of the
peasantry. 

Allow me to give you some information from the history of the origin of
this bill. I have been following its progress through the Council of
People’s Commissars fairly closely and must say that in the first draft,
tabled by the Food Commissariat, the main accent, generally speaking, was
on the hardworking farmer. The gist of Comrade Sereda’s proposals was that
it would be wrong to stake on the hard-working farmer, and that we should
stake on the village commune, the collective body. The Council’s attitude
on this question-at least, mine-was that we had to weigh all the pros and
cons and consult the local people. Indeed, it seemed wrong to me to reject
premiums for individual farmers, but that the village commune had to be
given priority-this might be all right if the local people with practical
experience confirmed that it could and should be done. From this conflict
of two points of view there emerged the formulation that was adopted for
the bill of the Council of People’s Commissars, namely, that both be
retained and a ratio established between the two kinds of premiums. The
details, as defined in the Council, were to be covered by instructions. In
fact the decision of the Council says that the instructions are to be drawn
up within a definite stated period by the Commissariat for Agriculture,
co-ordinated with the Commissariat for Food and endorsed by the Council of
People’s Commissars. As an exception to the general procedure, when
instructions are endorsed by a single order of the People’s Commissar
concerned,

    

we arranged not only for verification—the participation of two People’s
Commissars-but specially added that the Council of People’s Commissars
demanded that the instructions be submitted to it for
endorsement. Obviously, a great deal depended on the instructions. 

After certain explanations given by comrades your decision not to give
premiums to individual farms became clear to us. The Central Committee saw
the point. The point is fear of unfair premiums, the giving of premiums to
kulaks. Obviously, the best-run farms are those of the well-to-do peasants
and the kulaks, and there are still plenty of these in the villages, on
that score we haven’t the slightest doubt. If we, in paying a premium for
an efficient farm, did not take care to find out how that efficiency was
achieved, then, naturally, the kulak would prove to have the best-run
farm. And if we ignore the question as to how, at what price, economic
improvement is achieved, we shall find the kulak receiving unfair
privileges. If we reward him with the means of production, that is, with
things that make for farm expansion, we shall find ourselves indirectly,
and perhaps even not quite indirectly, boosting the kulaks, because, in
rewarding an industrious farmer without considering whether or not he
achieved his good results by kulak practices, and what is more, rewarding
him with things like the means of production, that is to say, things he can
use to strengthen his influence with, we shall, of course, be running
counter to the basic provisions of not only the agrarian, but of all Soviet
policy, and infringing the basic principle—that of supporting the
interests of the working people against those of the kulaks. In doing so we
shall really be seriously undermining the principles and foundations of
all Soviet policy in general, and not only of agrarian policy. 

But if we are to draw from this the conclusion that individual farmers
should not be rewarded, then take the following example: we give bonuses to
individual workers at factories and mills, where collective, socialised,
labour has reached an incomparably higher level than in agriculture. What
is to be done about the peasantry then? In a peasant country, where
individual peasant labour predominates to the extent of nine-tenths,
probably ninety-nine per cent, where

    

we have twenty million peasant farms, we want to promote these farms and we
must do so come what may. We know that their efficiency can he raised only
after several long years of radical technical reform. We have learned
something in our three years of practical work. We know how to build up the
foundations of communism in agriculture—this can be done at the cost of a
tremendous technical evolution. We clearly visualise that elaborated plan
with located electric stations, we know the minimum-programme, the
programme for the next ten years, but in this book on electrification we
also have a maximum-programme, in which gigantic work is planned for years
ahead. But now we have twenty million separate farms, which are run
separately and cannot be run in any other way; and if we don’t encourage
them to raise productivity this would be grossly wrong, it would be clearly
overdoing it, it means a refusal to see facts of reality that strike the
eye, facts that we have to reckon with and be guided by. It would be
desirable, of course, to have these farms rise through collectivism, by
whole volosts, communes, etc. But how far that is possible at present is a
thing we have to reckon with. If you, working in the local areas, support
progress in this direction and raise a whole commune or a whole
volost—all the better; in that case give them all that is best in premium
payments. But are you sure that you will manage it, that it is not sheer
fantasy, which in the practical work will lead to the greatest blunders?


That is why we propose to you the last part of the



C.C’s resolution
reworded or amended as the practical workers may deem fit for inclusion in
the resolution of the Congress of Soviets, so that this question should be
decided by you and you should say here: premiums and rewards for individual
farmers are acceptable under three known conditions. First, premiums for
rural communes first and foremost, with householders coming second and
receiving what remains—to this we agree. The second point says individual
farmers who have achieved economic success by kulak practices should not be
rewarded; it should not be a case of-you have made a go of it economically,
you are to be rewarded. If anyone has achieved economic success, but
employed a kulak method in doing so, whether in the form

    

of a loan, the hiring of labourers, or profiteering—kulak practices
sometimes dodge the law-if anyone has employed the slightest kulak method
to achieve success, he is to forfeit reward of any kind. This is the second
restriction which goes still further to meet your principled point of view
as to combating the kulaks and supporting the working middle peasants and
poor peasants. The third restriction—what is to be issued as
premiums. They may be given in the form of means of production—things
like implements and machines that serve to expand and improve the farm;
articles of consumption may be issued, household articles of adornment,
things that make the home brighter and life more beautiful. We say: “Give
the individual farmers only consumer and household goods, and, of course,
medals.”  You have already accepted the Order of the Red

Banner.[15] As to the means of production, these may be given to
individual farmers, but of such a type and on such conditions that they
should not be usable for kulak purposes. No machines should be given, not
even to the most hardworking farmer, not even if he has achieved success
without the least resort to kulak practices. Machines should not be given,
because by the very nature of their employment they require collective
labour, and a farmer who receives a machine will not be able to use it by
himself. 

These are the considerations the C.C. was guided by and on the basis of
which we have asked you to reconsider your decision, exchange opinions, and
alter your decision if you deem it possible so as to allow individual
farmers to be rewarded on the three conditions set forth above. If we do
not accept this, we may not achieve needed results, since farm improvements
cannot be carried out in a tired and ruined country without a special
effort, and the hardworking farmers have to be rewarded. All hard work that
contains no element of kulak practices should be rewarded. That is why we
think that on considering these reasons you will agree to premiums subject
to the three restrictive conditions mentioned above, which we think are
really necessary in the interests of our economic development.

Reply To Questions At The Meeting

 Of The R.C.P. Group

 Of The Eighth Congress Of Soviets 
December 27

Before answering the notes it must be stated definitely
whether a formal difference of opinion exists between the congress group
and the Central Committee. Dealing with what the first speakers have said
here: we adopted a definite decision, intending to fight the kulaks, but at
that time you did not have the methods of struggle outlined by us in the
three addenda. What did the comrades who, opposed these addenda say here?
As a matter of fact they said nothing. The peasant Red Armyman who spoke

here[16] said that the kulaks exist and they are growing, but we say
definitely: if they are kulaks they will receive no reward. You are being
asked to make that a law. Moreover, if the middle peasant achieves
betterment individually, but may use it to become a kulak, he is not to
receive a premium. What argument, then, has been advanced here against our
reasons?  None at all. It is reiterated that the kulak should not be
rewarded. But we agree to that. 

I shall deal now with the notes that have been sent up. The first one:



   1) What will be the criterion for a “hardworking kulak”
   and a “hardworking middle peasant”? 

   2) If we do find that criterion here and work out a plan,
   how are we going to carry it out locally, all the more in places where the
   kulaks are still playing the leading role? 

   3) Where is the line to be drawn between rewarding a
   whole collective body and an individual farmer, or are both of them to be
   rewarded? 


For one thing, the peasants know this better than we do. If the law
bans any reward for people employing kulak practices, then this is broader
than the notion of the kulak. The kulak is a man who generally uses kulak
methods, and one or another kulak method is used by almost every middle
peasant. That means we not only forbid premiums being given to kulaks but
to any middle peasant as well, if he uses kulak methods, and these methods
are endless

    

in their variety. That crude method by which an extra horse was
bought for five poods is not the only

one.[17] Would a premium be given to a kulak like that? What makes you
think that people in the country will close their eyes to this? As to the
criterion for a hardworking kulak and a hard-working middle peasant, the
local people know this perfectly well. We have no intention of writing a
law about this, as it would mean writing a whole volume describing kulak
practices, and people locally know this perfectly well. 

Secondly, haven’t we got uyezd committees of the Party, won’t this
thing be handled by the rural commune, by the volost land departments, by
the Party cell? How can we speak about fighting the kulaks in the local
areas if there are no fighting cells there? This argument is beyond
me. 

Thirdly, the law says that priority is given to the collective body
with the individual farmer coming second. The differentiation will be made
in greater detail by the Uyezd Party Committee and all the other bodies
that exist locally. 

The second note: 


In introducing its amendment does the CC. regard it as a
   political act, an incentive to the “hardworking peasants” to improve
   farming and industry in general so as to make it easier in the course of
   time to introduce collective cultivation? Will you please answer this? 


In the first place, here is proof that there is nothing specially
political in this question, something that should be kept from the
non-Party peasants. Therefore I consider it quite right and think it should
be made a custom to invite non-Party people to our group meetings on such
questions. They will have no right of decision at the group meetings, but
why not consult them? Our economic practice has shown that it is advisable
to go over from individual to collective labour, but having experienced
what this going means, we should not try to take it in our stride, but try
to understand the need for doing it, the slower the going the better. 

The third note: 


I think the advocates of commune premiums ought to be
   asked whether they have enough ploughs and other implements to reward the
   commune with or not. If not, it’s not worth talking about. 


This argument is incorrect. Generally speaking, we have few articles
usable as premiums, and so few ploughs that,

    

as means of production, we shall not give them to individuals, but only to
whole communes But why should we not, if we can, give a plough to a peasant
who has worked hard to raise productivity? And who is to decide whether he
is a kulak element or not? We must lend an ear to what people say lower
down. 

The next note: 


Will you please, if possible, answer the following
   question right now on the back of this note. The Svyatiye Kresty Uyezd,
   Stavropol Gubernia, where I work, has had 10,000,000 poods of grain imposed
   on it for delivery by December 1,1920. We have delivered 3,200,000
   poods. Owing to poor fulfilment we are widely practising confiscation of
   property from kulak elements, and so I ask you again, will you please tell
   us what we are to do? Should we carry out confiscation, or do it only as a
   last resort, so as not to ruin the farm? 


This has no relation to the law we are discussing. Go on acting the way
you have been doing. In strict conformity with the decree of the Soviet
government and your own communist conscience go on freely acting the way
you have been doing till now. 

The next note.: 


How is the “hardworking kulak” to be distinguished from
   the concept of “hardworking peasant”? 


Our bill covers all that, and your asking this is an abuse of question
time. 

Next we are asked: 


Who can define a hardworking peasant and how, say in any village? If
   this is to be done by elected or authorised persons in the village, it will
   mean an abuse of elected and authorised persons. 


I have already said that we must make use of our Party. We have the
Committees of Poor Peasants, and in the Ukraine we have their
counterpart. 


   1) Please consider this. Peasant farmers were given a
   premium for delivering hemp in 1920. They received 100 arshins of textiles
   each, but the village poor haven’t received an arshin yet for 1920. 

   2) Is the fact taken into consideration that the system
   of premiums to individual farmers is an obstacle in the way of setting up
   collective farms and partly bolsters up the shaken foundations of
   capitalism in agriculture? 


Comrades, you know that individual peasant farms with us are the
foundations of capitalism, in a manner of speaking.

    

There is no doubt about that, and I pointed this out in my report, when I
said straight out that the “Sukharevka” we had to fear was not the one
that existed on Sukharevka Square or existed secretly on any other square,
but the one that sits in the breast of every individual peasant farmer.* *
See p. 247 of this volume.-Ed. Can we get away from this in a year or two
years? We cannot. But farming has to be improved right now. You are guided
by excellent communist motives, but you want to jump from this floor to
that top, and we say-it won’t work, act more carefully and gradually 

Further: 


Why don’t the Food Commissariat and other institutions
   give food products for bonuses to workers of Group 3? 


I don’t know why, but I should imagine it’s because we have terribly
little food products available for bonus payments. 


Will you kindly answer this question: What does the
   C.C. of the R.C.P. think of the idea of rewarding the more well-to-do
   peasants, i.e., those who have large allotments which they work themselves?
   And at the same time, how do the land-poor peasants stand who have no
   chance of giving a good account of themselves because they have so little
   land? 


Why does he have a large allotment? If it is unfair, why does the
commune or the Land Department let him keep it? Because others are not able
to cultivate it. So why punish him, if he works hard on it? If he uses
kulak methods, don’t let him do it, if he holds the allotment unfairly,
take it away from him and give it to others, to those who will work it, but
don’t blame a man for having a lot of land. In Russia there is no private
property, the land is distributed by you yourselves and by, the commune. In
Russia there are people who have large amounts of land. If the Party
committee and the Soviet bodies see this and do nothing about it, they
should be given the sack, but people should not be deprived of their
premiums. 

Two more notes. The first: 


Will this point of the bill apply to the Ukraine? 

 

I think it will, and I very much regret that not a single one of the
comrades working in the Ukrainian Poor Peasants’ Committees has spoken
here. I think the premature closing of the debate a great mistake. 

The second one: 


If the R.C.P. congress group rejects the resolution of
   the CC. shall we be worthy members of the R.C.P. or just showing our
   obstinacy? 


My answer to this note is a document called “Rules of the Russian
Communist Party”. In Clause 62 of this document we read: “On matters
relating to its inner life and current work the group is

autonomous.”[18] This means that all members of the group have the
right and are bound to vote according to their conscience and not on the
instructions of the C.C. If, in voting according to your conscience, you
pass a second decision against the C.C’s proposal, we are obliged, on the
basis of Clause 62, to summon the Central Committee, and we shall do so at
once, and you will send your representatives to attend its meeting. A
serious question like this were best discussed two or three times to iron
out serious differences of opinion between us. That is how matters stand,
that is how we have to act. You have to vote now, not because the higher
Party body has issued directives, but because you have either been
persuaded or you have not. 

Comrades here were wrong to say that things must have been in a poor
way if Lenin has been sent to speak up for them. This is not true. The
Party Rules define your rights exactly. That’s one thing. Secondly, it
isn’t true because there was not a single difference of opinion on this
question in the Central Committee, which said outright: We have been
carried away by our struggle against the kulaks and have forgotten
measure. Let us remind people about measure. 

The C.C. appointed two comrades because these two members of the
C.C. had occasion, during the discussion of the bill, to take a more active
part in it than others and spoke in the debates. I handled all the drafts,
and so did Preobrazhensky. That’s why the two of us were appointed.

Addenda To The Resolution On The Agrarian Question 

Premiums to individual householders should, 

first, come second compared with premiums to whole communes and
collective bodies generally: 

second, individual householders should be given premiums and generally
rewarded only on the strict condition that the individual farmers have
achieved their economic successes without the slightest use of kulak
methods; 

third, that individual householders receive premiums in the shape of
medals, consumer goods, household goods, and so on; premiums in the shape
of means of production are permissible for individual householders
strictly on condition that only such means of production are issued as
could under no circumstance be instrumental in turning the farmer into a

kulak.[19]

The Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’,
Peasants’, Red Army and Cossack Deputies was held in Moscow from December
22 to 29, 1920. There was a record attendance of 2,537 delegates, of whom
1,728 had a vote and 809 a consultative voice. Of the total number of
detcgates 91.7 per cent were Communists, 2.7 per cent sympathisers, 3.9 per
cent non-Party people, 0.3 per cent Mensheviks, 0.3 per cent Bundists, 0.15
per cent Left S.Rs, 0.15 per cent anarchists, and 0.8 per cent from other
parties. The questions on the agenda were: Report on the Work of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s
Commissars; Electrification of Russia; Rehabilitation of Industry and
Transport; Development of Agricultural Production and Assistance to Peasant
Farming; Improving the Work of Soviet Agencies and Combating
Bureaucratism. The principal questions on the agenda were discussed
beforehand at meetings of the R.C.P. group. The congress set up three
sections, on industry, agriculture and state organisation, to thrash out
these problems. 

At the plenary sessions of the congress Lenin delivered
a report on December 22 on the work of the All-Russia Central Executive
Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars, and a speech on December
23 winding up the debate on this question. He also took the floor six times
at meetings of the Communist group of the congress (December 21, 22, 24 and
27) on the question of concessions and during the debate of the bill on
measures to strengthen and develop peasant farming. See also present
edition, Vol. 31, pp. 463-534.  



[3]
By a decision of the plenum of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.)
dated December 8, 1920, The Tenth Congress of the Party was to be convened
in February 1921. In January, at the request of local organisations, the
CC. decided to postpone the convocation of the Congress till March. 



[4]
Sukharevka—a market-place  in Moscow. During
the years of foreign military intervention and civil war it was a centre
and symbol of black marketeering. It was closed down in 1932. 



[5]
Lenin is referring to the Decree of the Council of
People’s Commissars on Concessions dated November 23, 1920. It was
published in Izvestia  No. 265 (1112) on November 25, 1920. 



[6]
Curzon’ a Note was a result of the successes of the Red
Army, which had ousted the White Polish invaders from the Ukraine and
Byelorussia in the summer of 1920. To hold up the advance of the Red Army
and prevent a possible collapse of bourgeois Poland and defeat of Wrangel,
the British Government sent a Note to Soviet Russia on July 11, 1920,
signed by the British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon. The Note in the form
of an ultimatum demanded that the advance of the Red Army be stopped, that
an armistice be concluded with Poland, and that the war with Wrangel should
be terminated. The British Government offered to act as mediator and on
behalf of the Allies’ Supreme Council threatened, in the event of the
ultimatum being rejected, to assist Poland “with all the means at its
disposal”.  

In its reply, based on Lenin’s proposals, the Soviet
Government firmly rejected Curzon’s mediation and insisted on direct
negotiations with Poland. The Soviet Government protested against Britain’s
attempt to annex the Crimea and agreed to guarantee the personal safety of
Wrangel and his troops only on condition that they surrender immediately
and completely. 



[7]
This refers to the booklet Yediny Icliozyaistvenny
plan i yediny khozyaistvenny apparat  (An Integrated Economic Plan and
an Integrated Economic Apparatus) by S. I. Gusev, published in 1920 with a
view to the forthcoming Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets. 



[8]
This figure gives the number of employees in all
administrative, economic and cultural institutions, which were then run by
the Moscow Soviet.  



[9]
Lenin is referring to Gusev’s booklet Ocherednige
voprosy khozga- istvennogo stroitelstva  (Immediate Problems of
Economic Development. (On, CC., R.C.P. Theses.) Materials for the Ninth
Party Congress published in 1920.  



[10]
This refers to the Far-Eastern Republic. 

In the autumn of 1920 Washington Vanderlip,
representing the U. S. Vanderlip Syndicate, conducted negotiations in
Moscow for a concession on fishing and the prospecting and extraction of
oil and coal in Kamchatka and other parts of Siberia east of the 160th
meridian. At the end of October an agreement was drafted under which the
Syndicate was to receive a concession for a term of sixty years. On the
expiry of 35 years the Soviet Government was entitled to buy out all
concession enterprises, and on the expiry of the agreed term the
enterprises with their equipment in full running order were to be made over
without compensation to the R.S.F.S.R. The Syndicate, however did not
receive the support of the U.S. Administration and financial tycoons and
the agreement was never signed. 



[11]
Lenin apparently has in mind the following section of
the Programme of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks). ,In all its work
in the countryside the R.C.P. continues to rely on the proletarian and
semi-proletarian elements, organises them first of all into an independent
force by creating Party cells in the countryside, organisations of the poor
peasants, a special type of trade unions with a membership of rural
proletarians and semi-proletarians, and so on, bringing them as close
together as possible to the urban proletariat and tearing them away from
under the influence of the rural bourgeoisie and petty proprietary
interests (The C.P.S.U. in Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses,
Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee, Part I, 1954,
p. 425). 



[12]
The full name is Vser’abotzemles, standing for Farm and
 Forest Workers’ Trade Union.  



[13]
Lenin is referring to the section of the Bolshevik
Party Pragramme which says: “The participation of the trade unions in
running the economy and drawing the broad masses into this activity is at
the same time a chief means of struggle against the bureaucratisation of
the economic apparatus of Soviet power and makes for a truly popular
control over the results of production” (The C.P.S. U. in Resolutions
and Decisions of Congresses, Confe-rences and Plenary Meetings of the
Central Committee, Part I. 



[14]
During the discussion of the draft resolution of the
Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, “On Measures to Consolidate and
Develop Peasant Farming” the Communist group at the congress declared for
the elimination of the points concerning personal premiums for individual
farmers. On December 27, 1920, the C.C.  at a plenary meeting, examined
this question, pointed out that the congress group had adopted an erroneous
decision and suggested that it be revised. The plenum adopted Lenin’s
motion defining the conditions and principles for rewarding individual
farmers (sec pp. 266-67 of this volume). The plenum authorised Lenin to
deliver a report on this question before the congress group. After Lenin’s
speech the group withdrew its former decision. 



[15]
The Order of the Red Banner  was instituted by
a decision of the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets as an award to
groups of working people and individual citizens who displayed conspicu-
ous devotion, initiative, industry and self-discipline in tackling economic
problems.  



[16]
The person referred to was Yeryomin, a delegate to the
Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets. 



[17]
Lenin’s speech at the congress group meeting (see
p. 257-61 of this volume) was followed by debates, in which Red Armyman
Yeryomin, a middle peasant, tried to prove that the kulaks would be able
all the same to take the poor peasants’ farming implements and horses away
from them. He cited an example of Kozlov Uyezd, Tambov Gubernia, where the
starving peasant poor were compelled to sell their horses to the kulaks for
five poods of grain.

The Party discussion and the factional struggle,
    which is of a type that occurs before a congress—before and
    in connection with the impending elections to the Tenth Congress
    of the R.C.P.—are waxing hot. The first factional
    pronouncement, namely, the one made by Comrade Trotsky on behalf
    of “a number of responsible workers” in his
    “platform pamphlet” (The Role and Tasks of the
    Trade Unions, with a preface dated December 25, 1920), was
    followed by a sharp pronouncement (the reader will see from what
    follows that it was deservedly sharp) by the Petrograd
    organisation of the R.C.P. (“Appeal to the Party”,
    published in Petrogradskaya Pravda [2] on
    January 6, 1921, and in the Party’s Central Organ, the
    Moscow Pravda, on January 13, 1921). The Moscow Committee
    then came out against the Petrograd organisation (in the same
    issue of Pravda ). Then appeared a verbatim report,
    published by the bureau of the R.C.P. group of the All-Russia
    Central Council of Trade Unions, of the discussion that took place
    on December 30, 1920, at a very large and important Party meeting,
    namely, that of the R.C.P. group at the Eighth Congress of
    Soviets. It is entitled The Role of the Trade Unions in
    Production (with a preface dated January 6, 1921). This, of
    course, is by no means all of the discussion material. Party
    meetings to discuss these issues are being held almost
    everywhere. On December 30, 1920, I spoke at a meeting in
    conditions in which, as I put it then, I “departed from the
    rules of procedure”, i.e., in conditions in which I could
    not take part in the discussion or hear the preceding and
    subsequent speakers. I shall now try to make amends and express
    myself in a more “orderly” fashion.
The Danger Of Factional 
      Pronouncements To The Party
Is Comrade Trotsky’s pamphlet The Role and Tasks of
    the Trade Unions a factional pronouncement? Irrespective of
    its content, is there any danger to the Party in a pronouncement
    of this kind? Attempts to hush up this question are a particularly
    favourite exercise with the members of the Moscow Committee (with
    the exception of Comrade Trotsky, of course), who see the
    factionalism of the Petrograd comrades, and with Comrade Bukharin,
    who, however, felt obliged, on December 30, 1920, to make the
    following statement on behalf of the “buffer
    group”:
  “. . . when a train seems to be heading
    for a crash, a buffer is not a bad thing at all” (report of
    the December 30,1920 discussion, p. 45). 
    
So there is some danger of a crash. Can we conceive of
    intelligent members of the Party being indifferent to the question
    of how, where and when this danger arose?
Trotsky’s pamphlet opens with the statement that
    “it is the fruit of collective work”, that “a
    number of responsible workers, particularly trade unionists
    (members of the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Council of
    Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Metalworkers’
    Union, Tsektran and others)” took part in compiling it, and
    that it is a “platform pamphlet”. At the end of thesis
    4 we read that “the forthcoming Party Congress will have to
    choose [Trotsky’s italics] between the two trends
    within the trade union movement”.
If this is not the formation of a faction by a member of the
    Central Committee, if this does not mean “heading for a
    crash”, then let Comrade Bukharin, or anyone of his
    fellow-thinkers, explain to the Party any other possible meaning
    of the words “factionalism “, and the Party
    “seems to be heading for a crash”. Who can be more
    purblind than men wishing to play the “buffer” and
    closing their eyes to such a “danger of a
    crash”?
Just imagine: after the Central Committee had spent two plenary
    meetings (November 9 and December 7) in an unprecedentedly long,
    detailed and heated discussion of Comrade Trotsky’s original
    draft theses and of the entire trade union policy that he
    advocates for the Party, one member of the Central Committee,
    one out of nineteen, forms a group outside the Central
    Committee and presents its “collective work” as a
    “platform”, inviting the Party Congress “to
    choose between two trends”! This, incidentally,
    quite apart from the fact that Comrade Trotsky’s
    announcement of two and only two trends on December 25, 1920,
    despite Bukharin’s coming out as a “buffer” on
    November 9, is a glaring exposure of the Bukharin group’s
    true role as abettors of the worst and most harmful sort of
    factionalism. But I ask any Party member: Don’t you find
    this attack and insistence upon’choosing” between two
    trends in the trade union movement rather sudden? What is there
    for us to do but stare in astonishment at the fact that after
    three years of the proletarian dictatorship even one Party member
    can be found to “attack” the two trends issue in
    this way ?
Nor is that all. Look at the factional attacks in which this
    pamphlet abounds. In the very first thesis we find a threatening
    “gesture” at “certain workers in the trade union
    movement” who are thrown “back to trade-unionism, pure
    and simple, which the Party repudiated in principle long ago
    “ (evidently the Party is represented by only one member of
    the Central Committee’s nineteen). Thesis 8 grandiloquently
    condemns “the craft conservatism prevalent among the top
    trade union functionaries” (note the truly bureaucratic
    concentration of attention on the “top”!). Thesis 11
    opens with the astonishingly tactful, conclusive and business-like
    (what is the most polite word for it?) “hint” that the
    “majority of the trade unionists . . . give only formal,
    that is, verbal, recognition” to the resolutions of
    the Party’s Ninth Congress.
We find that we have some very authoritative judges before us
    who say the majority (!) of the trade unionists give only
    verbal recognition to the Party’s decisions.

    

      Thesis 12 reads:
 “. . . many trade unionists take an ever
      more aggressive and uncompromising stand against the prospect
      of’coalescence’. . . . Among them we find Comrades
      Tomsky and Lozovsky.
 “What is more, many trade unionists,
    balking at the new tasks, and methods, tend to cultivate in their
    midst a spirit of corporative exclusiveness and hostility for the
    new men who are being drawn into the given branch of the economy,
    thereby actually fostering the survivals of craft-unionism among
    the organised workers.”
Let the reader go over these arguments carefully and ponder
    them. They simply abound in “gems”. Firstly, the
    pronouncement must be assessed from the standpoint of
    factionalism! Imagine what Trotsky would have said, and how he
    would have said it, if Tomsky had published a platform accusing
    Trotsky and “many” military workers of cultivating the
    spirit of bureaucracy, fostering the survivals of savagery,
    etc. What is the “role” of Bukharin, Preobrazhensky,
    Serebryakov and the others who fail to see—positively fail
    to note, utterly fail to note—the aggressiveness and
    factionalism of all this, and refuse to see how much more
    factional it is than the pronouncement of the Petrograd
    comrades?
Secondly, take a closer look at the approach to the subject:
    many trade unionists “tend to cultivate in their midst a
    spirit”. . . . This is an out-and-out bureaucratic
    approach. The whole point, you see, is not the level of
    development and living conditions of the masses in their millions,
    but the “spirit” which Tomsky and Lozovsky tend to
    cultivate “in their midst”.
Thirdly, Comrade Trotsky has unwittingly revealed the
    essence of the whole controversy which he and the
    Bukharin and Co. “buffer” have been evading and
    camouflaging with such care.
What is the point at issue? Is it the fact that many trade
    unionists are balking at the new tasks and methods and tend to
    cultivate in their midst a spirit of hostility for the new
    officials?
Or is it that the masses of organised workers are legitimately
    protesting and inevitably showing readiness to throw out the new
    officials who refuse to rectify the useless and harmful excesses
    of bureaucracy?
Is it that someone has refused to understand the “new
    tasks and methods”?
Or is it that someone is making a clumsy attempt to cover up
    his defence of certain useless and harmful excesses of bureaucracy
    with a lot of talk about new tasks and methods?
It is this essence of the dispute that the reader
    should bear in mind. 
    
Formal Democracy and the Revolutionary
    Interest
“Workers’ democracy is free from fetishes”,
    Comrade Trotsky writes in his theses, which are the “fruit
    of collective work”. “Its sole consideration is the
    revolutionary interest” (thesis 23).
Comrade Trotsky’s theses have landed him in a mess. That
    part of them which is correct is not new and, what is more, turns
    against him. That which is new is all wrong.
I have written out Comrade Trotsky’s correct
    propositions. They turn against him not only on the point in
    thesis 23 (Glavpolitput) but on the others as well.
Under the rules of formal democracy, Trotsky had a
    right to come out with a factional platform even against the
    whole of the Central Committee. That is indisputable. What is also
    indisputable is that the Central Committee had endorsed this
    formal right by its decision on freedom of discussion adopted on
    December 24, 1920. Bukharin, the buffer, recognises this formal
    right for Trotsky, but not for the Petrograd organisation,
    probably because on December 30, 1920, he talked himself into
    “the sacred slogan of workers’ democracy”
    (verbatim report, p. 45). . . .
Well, and what about the revolutionary interest?
Will any serious-minded person who is not blinded by the
    factional egotism of Tsektran” or of the
    “buffer” faction, will anyone in his right mind say
    that such a pronouncement on the trade union issue by
    such a prominent leader as Trotsky does promote the
    revolutionary interest ?
Can it be denied that, even if Trotsky’s “new tasks
    and methods” were as sound as they are in fact unsound (of
    which later), his very approach would be damaging to himself, the
    Party, the trade union movement, the training of millions of trade
    union members and the Republic?
It looks as if the kind Bukharin and his group call them selves
    a “buffer” because they have firmly decided not to
    think about the obligations this title imposes upon
    them. 
The Political Danger Of Splits In The Trade Union
    Movement
Everyone knows that big disagreements sometimes grow out of
    minute differences, which may at first appear to be altogether
    insignificant. A slight cut or scratch, of the kind everyone has
    had scores of in the course of his life, may become very dangerous
    and even fatal if it festers and if blood
    poisoning sets in. This may happen in any kind of conflict, even a
    purely personal one. This also happens in politics.
Any difference, even an insignificant one, may become
    politically dangerous if it has a chance to grow into a split, and
    I mean the kind of split that will shake and destroy the whole
    political edifice, or lead, to use Comrade Bukharin’s
    simile, to a crash.
Clearly, in a country under the dictatorship of the
    proletariat, a split in the ranks of the proletariat, or between
    the proletarian party and the mass of the proletariat, is not just
    dangerous; it is extremely dangerous, especially when the
    proletariat constitutes a small minority of the population. And
    splits in the trade union movement (which, as I tried hard to
    emphasise in my speech on December 30, 1920, is a movement of the
    almost completely organised proletariat) mean precisely splits in
    the mass of the proletariat.
That is why, when the whole thing started at the Fifth
    All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions on November 2-6, 1920 (and
    that is exactly where it did start), and when right after the
    Conference—no, I am mistaken, during that
    Conference—Comrade Tomsky appeared before the Political
    Bureau in high dudgeon and, fully supported by Comrade Rudzutak,
    the most even-tempered of men, began to relate that at the
    Conference Comrade Trotsky had talked about “shaking
    up” the trade unions and that he, Tomsky, had opposed
    this—when that happened, I decided there and then that
    policy (i.e., the Party’s trade union policy) lay at the
    root of the controversy, and that Comrade Trotsky, with his
    “shake-up” policy against Comrade Tomsky, was entirely
    in the wrong. For, even if the “shake-up ”
    policy were partly justified by the “new tasks and
    methods” (Trotsky’s thesis 12), it cannot be tolerated
    at the present time, and in the present situation, because it
    threatens a split.
It now seems to Comrade Trotsky that it is “an utter
    travesty “ to ascribe the “shake-up-from-above “
    policy to him (L. Trotsky, “A Reply to the Petrograd
    Comrades”, Pravda No. 9, January 15, 1921). But
    “shake-up” is a real “catchword”, not only
    in the sense that after being uttered by Comrade Trotsky at the
    Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions it has, you might say,
    “caught on” throughout the Party and the trade
    unions. Unfortunately, it remains true even today in the much more
    profound sense that it alone epitomises the whole spirit,
    the whole trend of the platform pamphlet entitled The
    Role and Tactics of the Trade Unions. Comrade Trotsky’s
    platform pamphlet is shot through with the spirit of the
    “shake-up-from-above” policy. Just recall the
    accusation made against Comrade Tomsky, or “many trade
    unionists”, that they “tend to cultivate in their
    midst a spirit of hostility for the new men”!
But whereas the Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions
    (November 2-6, 1920) only saw the makings of the atmosphere
    fraught with splits, the split within Tsektran became a fact in
    early December 1920.
This event is basic and essential to an understanding of the
    political essence of our controversies; and Comrades Trotsky and
    Bukharin are mistaken if they think hushing it up will help
    matters. A hush-up in this case does not produce a
    “buffer” effect but rouses passions; for the question
    has not only been placed on the agenda by developments, but has
    been emphasised by Comrade Trotsky in his platform pamphlet. It is
    this pamphlet that repeatedly, in the passages I have quoted,
    particularly in thesis 12, raises the question of whether the
    essence of the matter is that “many trade unionists tend to
    cultivate in their midst a spirit of hostility for the new
    men”, or that the “hostility” of the
    masses is legitimate in view of certain useless and
    harmful excesses of bureaucracy, for example, in Tsektran.
The issue was bluntly and properly stated by Comrade Zinoviev
    in his very first speech on December 30, 1920, when he said that
    it was “Comrade Trotsky’s immoderate adherents”
    who had brought about a split. Perhaps that is why Comrade
    Bukharin abusively described Comrade Zinoviev’s speech as
    “a lot of hot air”? But every Party member who reads
    the verbatim report of the December 30, 1920 discussion will see
    that that is not true. He will find that it is Comrade Zinoviev
    who quotes and operates with the facts, and that it is Trotsky and
    Bukharin who indulge most in intellectualist verbosity minus the
    facts.
When Comrade Zinoviev said, “Tsektran stands on feet of
    clay and has already split into three parts”, Comrade
    Sosnovsky interrupted and said:
“That is something you have encouraged
    “ (verbatim report, p. 15).
Now this is a serious charge. If it were proved, there would,
    of course, be no place on the Central Committee, in the R.C.P., or
    in the trade unions of our Republic for those who were guilty of
    encouraging a split even in one of the trade
    unions. Happily, this serious charge was advanced in a thoughtless
    manner by a comrade who, I regret to say, has now and again been
    “carried away” by thoughtless polemics before
    this. Comrade Sosnovsky has even managed to insert “a fly in
    the ointment” of his otherwise excellent articles, say, on
    production propaganda, and this has tended to negate all its
    pluses. Some people (like Comrade Bukharin) are so happily
    constituted that they are incapable of injecting venom into their
    attacks even when the fight is bitterest; others, less happily
    constituted, are liable to do so, and do this all too
    often. Comrade Sosnovsky would do well to watch his step in this
    respect, and perhaps even ask his friends to help out.
But, some will say, the charge is there, even if it has been
    made in a thoughtless, unfortunate and patently
    “factional” form. In a serious matter, the badly
    worded truth is preferable to the hush-up.
That the matter is serious is beyond doubt, for, let me say
    this again, the crux of the issue lies in this area to a
    greater extent than is generally suspected. Fortunately, we are in
    possession of sufficiently objective and conclusive facts to
    provide an answer in substance to Comrade
    Sosnovsky’s point.
First of all, there is on the same page of the verbatim report
    Comrade Zinoviev’s statement denying Comrade
    Sosnovsky’s allegation and making precise references to
    conclusive facts. Comrade Zinoviev showed that Comrade
    Trotsky’s accusation (made obviously, let me add, in an
    outburst of factional zeal) was quite a different one from Comrade
    Sosnovsky’s; Comrade Trotsky’s accusation was that
    Comrade Zinoviev’s speech at the September All-Russia
    Conference of the R.C.P. had helped to bring about or had
    brought about the split. (This charge, let me say in parenthesis,
    is quite untenable, if only because Zinoviev’s September
    speech was approved in substance by the Central Committee and the
    Party, and there has been no formal protest against it since.)
Comrade Zinoviev replied that at the Central Committee meeting
    Comrade Rudzutak had used the minutes to prove that
    “long before any of my [Zinoviev’sl speeches
    and the All-Russia Conference the question [concerning certain
    unwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy in Tsektran] had
    been examined in Siberia, on the Volga, in the North and in the
    South”.
That is an absolutely precise and clear-cut statement of
    fact. It was made by Comrade Zinoviev in his first speech before
    thousands of the most responsible Party members, and his facts
    were not refuted either by Comrade Trotsky, who spoke
    twice later, or by Comrade Bukharin, who also spoke
    later.
Secondly, the December 7, 1920 resolution of the Central
    Committee’s Plenary Meeting concerning the dispute between
    the Communists working in water transport and the Communist group
    at the Tsektran Conference, given in the same verbatiln
    report, was an even more definite and official refutation of
    Comrade Sosnovsky’s charges. The part of the resolution
    dealing with Tsektran says:
 “In connection with the dispute between
    Tsektran and the water transport workers, the Central Committee
    resolves: 1) To set up a Water Transport Section within the
    amalgamated Tsektran; 2) To convene a congress of railwaymen and
    water transport workers in February to hold normal elections to a
    new Tsektran; 3) To authorise the old Tsektran to function until
    then; 4) To abolish Glavpolitvod and Glavpolitput immediately and
    to transfer all their funds and resources to the trade union on
    normal democratic lines.”
 This shows that the water transport workers, far from being
    censured, are deemed to be right in every essential. Yet
    none of the C.C. members who had signed the common
    platform of January 14, 1921 (except Kamenev) voted for the
    resolution. (The platform referred to is the Role and Tasks of
    the Trade Unions. Draft Decision of the Tenth Congress of
    the R.C.P., submitted to the Central Committee by a group of
    members of the Central Committee and the trade union
    commission. Among those who signed it was Lozovsky, a member of
    the trade union commission but not of the Central Committee. The
    others were Tomsky, Kalinin, Rudzutak, Zinoviev, Stalin, Lenin,
    Kamenev, Petrovsky and Artyom Sergeyev.)
This resolution was carried against the C.C. members
    listed above, that is, against our group, for we would have voted
    against allowing the old Tsektran to continue temporarily. Because
    we were sure to win, Trotsky was forced to vote for
    Bukharin’s resolution, as otherwise our resolution would
    have been carried. Comrade Rykov, who had been for
    Trotsky in November, took part in the trade union
    commission’s examination of the dispute between Tsektran and
    the water transport workers in December, and saw that the latter
    were right.
To sum up: the December 7 majority in the Central Committee
    consisted of Comrades Trotsky, Bukharin, Preobrazhensky,
    Serebryakov and other C.C. members who are above suspicion of
    being biased against Tsektran. Yet the substance of their
    resolution did not censure the water transport workers but
    Tsektran, which they just stopped short of dissolving there and
    then. This proves Sosnovsky’s charge to be quite
    groundless.
There is one other point to be dealt with, if we are to leave
    no room for ambiguity. What were these “certain unwarranted
    and harmful excesses of bureaucracy” to which I have
    repeatedly referred? Isn’t this last charge
    unsupported or exaggerated?
Once again it was Comrade Zinoviev who, in his very first
    speech on December 30, 1920, provided the answer which was as
    precise as one could wish. He quoted from Comrade Zoff’s
    water transport circular of May 3, 1920: “Committee
    treadmill abolished.”[3] Comrade Zinoviev was
    quite right in saying this was a fundamental error. It exemplified
    the unwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy and the
    “appointments system”. But he said there and then that
    some appointees were “not half as experienced or as
    tried” as Comrade Zoff. I have heard Comrade Zoff referred
    to in the Central Committee as a most valuable worker, and this is
    fully borne out by my own observations in the Council of
    Defence. It has not entered anyone’s mind either to make
    scapegoats of such comrades or to undermine their authority (as
    Comrade Trotsky suggests, without the least justification, on page
    25 of his report). Their authority is not being undermined by
    those who try to correct the “appointees’”
    mistakes, but by those who would defend them even when they are
    wrong.
We see, therefore, that the danger of splits within the trade
    union movement was not imaginary but real. And we find that the
    actual disagreements really boiled down to a demand that certain
    unwarranted and harmful exccesses of bureaucracy, and the
    appointments system should not be justified or defended, but
    corrected. That is all there is to it.
Disagreements On Principle
There being deep and basic disagreements on principle—we
    may well be asked—do they not serve as vindication for the
    sharpest and most factional pronouncements? Is it possible to
    vindicate such a thing as a split, provided there is need to drive
    home some entirely new idea?
I believe it is, provided of course the disagreements are truly
    very deep and there is no other way to rectify a wrong trend in
    the policy of the Party or of the working class.
But the whole point is that there are no such
    disagreements. Comrade Trotsky has tried to point them out, and
    failed. A tentative or conciliatory approach had been
    possible—and necessary—before the publication
    of his pamphlet (December 25) (“such an approach is ruled
    out even in the case of disagreements and vague new tasks”);
    but after its publication we had to say: Comrade Trotsky
    is essentially wrong on all his new points.
This is most evident from a comparison of his theses with
    Rudzutak’s which were adopted by the Fifth All Russia
    Conference of Trade Unions (November 2-6). I quoted the latter in
    my December 30 speech and in the January 21 issue of
    Pravda. They are-fuller and more correct than
    Trotsky’s, and wherever the latter differs from Rudzutak, he
    is wrong.
Take this famous “industrial democracy”, which
    Comrade Bukharin hastened to insert in the Central
    Committee’s resolution of December 7. It would, of course,
    be ridiculous to quibble about this ill-conceived brainchild
    (“tricky flourishes”), if it merely occurred in an
    article or speech. But, after all, it was Trotsky and Bukharin who
    put themselves into the ridiculous position by insisting in
    their theses on this very term, which is the one feature that
    distinguishes their “platforms” from Rudzutak’s
    theses adopted by the trade unions.
The term is theoretically wrong. In the final analysis, every
    kind of democracy, as political superstructure in general (which
    must exist until classes have been abolished and a classless
    society established), serves production and is ultimately
    determined by the relations of production in a given society. It
    is, therefore, meaningless to single out “industrial
    democracy”, for this leads to confusion, and the result is a
    dummy. That is the first point.
The second is that if you look at Bukharin’s own
    explanation given in the resolution of the C.C. Plenary Meeting on
    December 7, which he drafted, you will find that he says:
    “Accordingly, the methods of workers’ democracy must
    be those of industrial democracy, which means. . . .” Note
    the “which means”! The fact is that Bukharin opens his
    appeal to the masses with such an outlandish term that he must
    give a gloss on it. This, I think, is
    undemocratic from the democratic standpoint. You must
    write for the masses without using terms that require a
    glossary. This is bad from the “production” standpoint
    because time is wasted in explaining unnecessary
    terms. “Which means,” he says, “that nomination
    and seconding of candidates, elections, etc., must proceed with an
    eye not only to their political staunchness, but also business
    efficiency, administrative experience, leadership, and proved
    concern for the working people’s material and spiritual
    interests.”
The reasoning there is obviously artificial and incorrect. For
    one thing, democracy is more than “nomination and seconding
    of candidates, elections, etc.” Then, again, not all
    elections should be held with an eye to political staunchness and
    business efficiency. Comrade Trotsky notwithstanding, an
    organisation of many millions must have a certain percentage of
    canvassers and bureaucrats (we shall not be able to make do
    without good bureaucrats for many years to come). But we do not
    speak of “canvassing” or “bureaucratic”
    democracy.
The third point is that it is wrong to consider only the
    elected, the organisers, the administrators, etc. After all, they
    constitute a minority of outstanding men. It is the mass, the rank
    and file that we must consider. Rudzutak has it in simpler, more
    intelligible and theoretically more correct terms (thesis 6):
 “. . . it must be brought home to each
    participant in production that his production tasks are
    appropriate and important; that each must not only take a hand in
    fulfilling his assignments, but also play an intelligent part in
    correcting any technical and organisational defects in the sphere
    of production. 
    
The fourth point is that “industrial democracy” is
    a term that lends itself to misinterpretation. It may be read as a
    repudiation of dictatorship and individual authority. It may be
    read as a suspension of ordinary democracy or a pretext for
    evading it. Both readings are harmful, and cannot be avoided
    without long special commentaries.
Rudzutak’s plain statement of the same ideas is more
    correct and more handy. This is indirectly confirmed by
    Trotsky’s parallel of “war democracy” which he
    draws with his own term in an article, “Industrial
    Democracy”, in Pravda of January 11, and which
    fails to refute that his term is inaccurate and inconvenient (for
    he side-steps the whole issue and fails to compare his theses with
    Rudzutak’s). Happily, as far as I can recall, we have never
    had any factional controversy over that kind of term.
Trotsky’s “production atmosphere” is even
    wider of the mark, and Zinoviev had good reason to laugh at
    it. This made Trotsky very angry, and he came out with this
    argument: “We once had a war atmosphere. . . . We must now
    have a production atmosphere and not only on the surface but deep
    down in the workers’ mass. This must be as intense and
    practical an interest in production as was earlier displayed in
    the fronts. . . .” Well, there you are: the message must be
    carried “deep down into the workers’ mass” in
    the language of Rudzutak’s theses, because “production
    atmosphere” will only earn you a smile or a shrug. Comrade
    Trotsky’s “production atmosphere” has
    essentially the same meaning as production propaganda, but such
    expressions must be avoided when production propaganda is
    addressed to the workers at large. The term is an example of how
    not to carry it on among the masses.
Politics And Economics. Dialectics And
    Eclecticism
It is strange that we should have to return to such elementary
    questions, but we are unfortunately forced to do so by Trotsky and
    Bukharin. They have both reproached me for “switching
    “ the issue, or for taking a “political”
    approach, while theirs is an “economic” one. Bukharin
    even put that in his theses and tried to “rise above”
    either side, as if to say that he was combining the two.
This is a glaring theoretical error. I said again in my speech
    that politics is a concentrated expression of economics, because I
    had earlier heard my “political” approach rebuked in a
    manner which is inconsistent and inadmissible for a
    Marxist. Politics must take precedence over economics. To argue
    otherwise is to forget the ABC of Marxism.
Am I wrong in my political appraisal? If you think so, say it
    and prove it. But you forget the ABC of Marxism when you say (or
    imply) that the political approach is equivalent to the
    “economic”, and that you can take “the one and
    the other”.
What the political approach means, in other words, is that the
    wrong attitude to the trade unions will ruin the Soviet power and
    topple the dictatorship of the proletariat. (In a peasant country
    like Russia, the Soviet power would surely go down in the event of
    a split between the trade unions and a Party in the wrong.) This
    proposition can (and must) be tested in substance, which means
    looking into the rights and wrongs of the approach and taking a
    decision. To say: I “appreciate” your political,
    approach, “but ” it is only a political one
    and we “also need an economic one”, is
    tantamount to saying: I “appreciate” your point that
    in taking that particular step you are liable to break your neck,
    but you must also take into consideration that it is
    better to be clothed and well-fed than to go naked and hungry.
Bukharin’s insistence on combining the political
    and the economic approach has landed him in theoretical
    eclecticism.
Trotsky and Bukharin make as though they are concerned for the
    growth of production whereas we have nothing but formal democracy
    in mind. This picture is wrong, because the only
    formulation of the issue (which the Marxist standpoint allows
    ) is: without a correct political approach to the matter the
    given class will be unable to stay on top, and,
    consequently, will be incapable of solving its
    production problem either.
Let us take a concrete example. Zinoviev says: “By
    carrying things to a split within the trade unions, you are making
    a political mistake. I spoke and wrote about the growth of
    production back in January 1920, citing the construction of the
    public baths as an example.” Trotsky replies: “What a
    thing to boast of: a pamphlet with the public baths as an example
    (p. 29),’and not a single word’ about the tasks of the
    trade unions” (p. 22).
This is wrong. The example of the public baths is worth, you
    will pardon the pun, a dozen “production atmospheres”,
    with a handful of “industrial democracies” thrown
    in. It tells the masses, the whole bulk of them, what the trade
    unions are to do, and does this in plain and intelligible terms,
    whereas all these “production atmospheres” and
    “democracies” are so much murk blurring the vision of
    the workers’ masses, and dimming their
    understanding.
Comrade Trotsky also rebuked me for not “saying a
    word” (p. 66) about “the role that has to be
    played—and is being played—by the levers known as the
    trade union apparatus”.
I beg to differ, Comrade Trotsky. By reading out
    Rudzutak’s theses in toto and endorsing them, I made a
    statement on the question that was fuller,
    plainer, clearer and more correct than all your
    theses, your report or co-report, and speech in reply to the
    debate. I insist that bonuses in kind and disciplinary
    comrades’ courts mean a great deal more to economic
    development, industrial management, and wider trade union
    participation in production than the absolutely abstract (and
    therefore empty) talk about “industrial democracy”,
    “coalescence”, etc.
Behind the effort to present the “production”
    standpoint (Trotsky) or to overcome a one-sided political approach
    and combine it with an economic approach (Bukharin) we find:
1)Neglect of Marxism, as expressed in the theoretically
    incorrect, eclectic definition of the relation between politics
    and economics;
2 )Defence or camouflage of the political mistake expressed in
    the shake-up policy, which runs through the whole of
    Trotsky’s platform pamphlet, and which, unless it is
    admitted and corrected, leads to the collapse of the
    dictatorship of the proletariat;
3)A step back in purely economic and production matters, and
    the question of how to increase production; it is, in fact, a step
    back from Rudzutak’s practical theses, with their
    concrete, vital and urgent tasks (develop production propaganda;
    learn proper distribution of bonuses in kind and correct use of
    coercion through disciplinary comrades’ courts), to the
    highbrow, abstract, “empty” and theoretically
    incorrect general theses which ignore all that
    is most practical and business-like.
That is where Zinoviev and myself, on the one hand, and Trotsky
    and Bukharin, on the other, actually stand on this question of
    politics and economics.
I could not help smiling, therefore, when I read Comrade
    Trotsky’s objection in his speech of December 30: “In
    his summing-up at the Eighth Congress of Soviets of the debate on
    the situation, Comrade Lenin said we ought to have less politics
    and more economics, but when he got to the trade union question he
    laid emphasis on the political aspect of the matter”
    (p. 65). Comrade Trotsky thought these words were “very much
    to the point”. Actually, however, they reveal a terrible
    confusion of ideas, a truly hopeless “ideological
    confusion”. Of course, I have always said, and will continue
    to say, that we need more economics and less politics, but if we
    are to have this we must clearly be rid of political dangers
    and political mistakes. Comrade Trotsky’s political
    mistakes, aggravated by Comrade Bukharin, distract our
    Party’s attention from economic tasks and
    “production” work, and, unfortunately,
    make us waste time on correcting them and arguing it out
    with the syndicalist deviation (which leads to the collapse of the
    dictatorship of the proletariat), objecting to the incorrect
    approach to the trade union movement (which leads to the collapse
    of the Soviet power), and debating general “theses”,
    instead of having a practical and business-like
    “economic” discussion as to whether it was the Saratov
    millers, the Donbas miners, the Petrograd metalworkers or some
    other group that had the best results in coalescing, distributing
    bonuses in kind, and organising comrades’ courts, on the
    basis of Rudzutak’s theses, adopted by the Fifth
    All-Russia-Trade Union Conference on November 2-6.
Let us now consider what good there is in a “broad
    discussion”. Once again we find political mistakes
    distracting attention from economic tasks. I was against this
    “broad” discussion, and I believed, and still do, that
    it was a mistake—a political mistake—on Comrade
    Trotsky’s part to disrupt the work of the trade union
    commission, which ought to have held a business-like discussion. I
    believe Bukharin’s buffer group made the political mistake
    of misunderstanding the tasks of the buffer (in which case they
    had once again substituted eclecticism for dialectics), for from
    the “buffer” standpoint they should have vigorously
    opposed any broad discussion and demanded that the matter should
    be taken up by the trade union commission. Here is what came of
    this.
On December 30, Bukharin went so far as to say that “we
    have proclaimed the new and sacred slogan of workers’
    democracy, which means that questions are no longer to be
    discussed in the board-room within the corporation or at small
    meetings but are to be placed before big meetings. I insist that
    by taking the trade union issue before such a large meeting as
    this one we are not taking a step backward but forward”
    (p. 45). And this man has accused Zinoviev of spouting “hot
    air” and overdoing the democracy! I say that he himself has
    given us a lot of hot air and has shown some unexampled bungling;
    he has completely failed to understand that formal democracy must
    be subordinate to the revolutionary interest.
Trotsky is in the same boat. His charge is that “Lenin
    wants at all costs to disrupt or shelve the discussion of the
    matter in essence” (p. 65). He declares: “My reasons
    for refusing to serve on the commission were clearly stated in the
    Central Committee: until such time as I am permitted, on a par
    with all other comrades, to air these questions fully in the Party
    press, I do not expect any good to come of any cloistered
    examination of these matters, and, consequently, of work on the
    commission” (p. 69).
What is the result? Less than a month has passed since Trotsky
    started his “broad discussion” on December 25, and you
    will be hard put to find one responsible Party worker in a hundred
    who is not fed up with the discussion and has not realised its
    futility (to say no worse). For Trotsky has made the Party waste
    time on a discussion of words and bad theses, and has ridiculed as
    “cloistered” the business-like economic
    discussion in the commission, which was to have studied and
    verified practical experience and projected its lessons for
    progress in real “production” work, in place
    of the regress from vibrant activity to scholastic
    exercises in all sorts of “production
    atmospheres”.
Take this famous “coalescence”. My advice on
    December 30 was that we should keep mum on this point, because we
    had not studied our own practical experience, and without
    that any discussion was bound to degenerate into “hot
    air” and draw off the Party’s forces from
    economic work. I said it was bureaucratic projecteering for
    Trotsky to propose in his theses that from one-third to one-half
    and from one-half to two-thirds of the economic councils should
    consist of trade unionists.
For this I was upbraided by Bukharin who, I see from p. 49 of
    the report, made a point of proving to me at length and in great
    detail that “when people meet to discuss something, they
    should not act as deaf-mutes” (sic ). Trotsky was
    also angry and exclaimed:
 “Will every one of you please make a note
    that on this particular date Comrade Lenin described this as a
    bureaucratic evil. I take the liberty to predict that within a few
    months we shall have accepted for our guidance and consideration
    that the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions and the
    Supreme Economic Council, the Central Committee of the
    Metalworkers’ Union and the Metals Department, etc., are to
    have from one-third to one-half of their members in common”
    (p. 68).
When I read that I asked Comrade Milyutin (Deputy Chairman of
    the Supreme Economic Council) to let me have the available
    printed reports on coalescence. I said to my self: why
    not make a small start on the study of our practical experience;
    it’s so dull engaging in “general Party talk”
    (Bukharin’s expression, p. 47, which has every chance of
    becoming a catchword like “shake-up”) to no useful
    purpose, without the facts, and inventing disagreements,
    definitions and “industrial democracies”.   

    

      Comrade
      Milyutin sent me several books, including The Report of the
Supreme Economic Council to the Eighth All-Russia Congress of
Soviets (Moscow, 1920; preface dated December 19, 1920). On
      its p. 14 is a table showing workers’ participation in
      administrative bodies. Here is the table (covering only part of
      the gubernia economic councils and factories):

It will be seen that 61.6 per cent, that is, closer to
    two-thirds than to one-half, of the staff of administrative bodies
    now consists of workers. And this already proves that what Trotsky
    wrote on this matter in his theses was an exercise in bureaucratic
    projecteering. To talk, argue and write platforms about
    “one-third to one-half” and “one-half to
    two-thirds” is the most useless sort of “general Party
    talk”, which diverts time, attention and resources from
    production work. It is empty politicking. All this while,
    a great deal of good could have been done in the commission, where
    men of experience would have refused to write any theses without a
    study of the facts, say, by polling a dozen or so “common
    functionaries” (out of the thousand), by comparing their
    impressions and conclusions with objective statistical data, and
    by making an attempt to obtain practical guidance for the future:
    that being our experience, do we go straight on, or do we make
    some change in our course, methods and approach, and how; or do we
    call a halt, for the good of the cause, and check things over and
    over again, make a few changes here and there, and so on and so
    forth.
Comrades, a real “executive” (let me also have a go
    at “production propaganda”) is well aware that even in
    the most advanced countries, the capitalists and their executives
    take years—sometimes ten and more—to study and test
    their own (and others’) practical experience, making
    innumerable starts and corrections to tailor a system of
    management, select senior and junior executives, etc., fit for
    their particular business. That was the rule under capitalism,
    which throughout the civilised world based its business practices
    on the experience and habits of centuries. We who are
    breaking new ground must put in a long, persistent and patient
    effort to retrain men and change the old habits which have come
    down to us from capitalism, but this can only be done little by
    little. Trotsky’s approach is quite wrong. In his December
    30 speech he exclaimed: “Do or do not our workers, Party and
    trade union functionaries have any production training? Yes or no?
    I say: No” (p. 29). This is a ridiculous approach. It is
    like asking whether a division has enough felt boots: Yes or
    no?
It is safe to say that even ten years from now we shall have to
    admit that all our Party and trade union functionaries do not have
    enough production training, in much the same way as the workers of
    the Military Department, the trade unions and the Party will not
    have had enough military experience. But we have made a
    start on production training by having about a thousand
    workers, and trade union members and delegates take part in
    management and run factories, head offices and other bodies higher
    up the scale. The basic principle underlying “production
    training”—which is the training of our own
    selves, of the old underground workers and professional
    journalists—is that we should start a painstaking and
    detailed study of our own practical experience, and teach others
    to do so, according to the rule: Look before you leap. The
    fundamental and absolute rule behind “production
    training” is systematic, circumspect, practical and business
    like verification of what this one thousand have done, and even
    more efficient and careful correction of their work, taking a step
    forward only when there is ample proof of the usefulness of a
    given method, system of management, proportion, selection of men,
    etc. And it is this rule that Comrade Trotsky has broken by his
    theses and approach. All his theses, his entire platform pamphlet,
    are so wrong that they have diverted the Party’s attention
    and resources from practical “production” work to a
    lot of empty talk.
Dialectics and Eclecticism 
      “School” and “Apparatus”
Among Comrade Bukharin’s many excellent traits are his
    theoretical ability and keen interest in getting at the
    theoretical roots of every question. That is a very valuable trait
    because you cannot have a proper understanding of any mistake, let
    alone a political one, unless you dig down to its theoretical
    roots among the basic premises of the one who makes it.
Responding to this urge, Comrade Bukharin tended to shift the
    controversy into the theoretical sphere, beginning from December
    30, if not earlier.
In his speech on that day he said: “That neither the
    political nor the economic factor can be ignored is, I believe,
    absolutely incontrovertible—and that is the theoretical
    essence of what is here known as the’buffer group’ or
    its ideology “ (p. 47).
The gist of his theoretical mistake in this case is
    substitution of eclecticism for the dialectical interplay of
    politics and economics (which we find in Marxism). His theoretical
    attitude is: “on the one hand, and on the other”,
    “the one and the other”. That is
    eclecticism. Dialectics requires an all-round consideration of
    relationships in their concrete development but not a patchwork of
    bits and pieces. I have shown this to be so on the example of
    politics and economics.
That of the “buffer” has gone to reinforce the
    point. You need a buffer, and it is useful when the Party train is
    heading for a crash. No question about that at all. Bukharin has
    built up his “buffer” problem eclectically, by
    collecting odd pieces from Zinoviev and Trotsky. As a
    “buffer”, Bukharin should have decided for himself
    just where, when and how each individual or group had made their
    mistake, whether it was a theoretical mistake, one of political
    tact, factional pronouncement, or exaggeration, etc. He should
    have done that and gone hammer and tongs at every such
    mistake. But he has failed to understand his task of
    “buffer”, and here is good proof of it.
The Communist group of Tsektran’s Petrograd Bureau (the
    C.C. of the Railwaymen’s and Water Transport Workers’
    Union), an organisation sympathising with Trotsky, has stated its
    opinion that, “on the main issue of the trade unions’
    role in production, Comrades Trotsky and Bukharin hold views which
    are variations of one and the same standpoint”. It has
    issued Comrade Bukharin’s report in Petrograd on January
    3,1921, in pamphlet form (N. Bukharin, The Tasks of the Trade
    Unions, Petrograd, 1921). It says:
 “Comrade Trotsky’s original
    formulation was that the trade union leadership should be removed
    and suitable comrades found to take their place, etc. He had
    earlier advocated a’shake-up’, but he has now
    abandoned the idea, and it is therefore quite absurd to use it as
    an argument against him” (p. 5).
I will let pass the numerous factual inaccuracies in this
    statement. (Trotsky used the term “shake-up” at the
    Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions, November 2-6. He
    mentions “selection of leadership” in Paragraph 5 of
    his theses which he submitted to the Central Committee on November
    8, and which, incidentally, some of his supporters have published
    as a leaflet. The whole of Trotsky’s pamphlet, The Role
    and Tasks of the Trade Unions, December 25, reveals the same
    kind of mentality, the same spirit as I have pointed out
    before. When and how he “abandoned” this attitude
    remains a mystery.) I am now dealing with a different matter. When
    the “buffer” is an eclectic, he passes over some
    mistakes and brings up others; he says nothing of them in Moscow
    on December 30, 1920, when addressing thousands of
    R.C.P. functionaries from all over Russia; but he brings them up
    in Petrograd on January 3, 1921. When the “buffer” is
    a dialectician, he directs the full brunt of his attack at every
    mistake he sees on either side, or on all sides. And that is
    something Bukharin does not do. He does not even try to examine
    Trotsky’s pamphlet in the light of the
    “shake-up” policy. He simply says nothing about
    it. No wonder his buffer performance has made everyone
    laugh.
To proceed. In that same Petrograd speech he says (p. 7):
 “Comrade Trotsky’s mistake is
    insufficient support for the school-of-communism idea.”
During the December 30 discussion, Bukharin reasoned as
    follows:
 “Comrade Zinoviev has said that the trade
    unions are a school of communism, and Trotsky has said that they
    are a technical and administrative apparatus for industrial
    management. I see no logical grounds for proof that either
    proposition is wrong; both, and a combination of both, are
    right” (p. 48).
Bukharin and his “group” or “faction”
    make the same point in their thesis 6: “On the one hand,
    they [the trade unions] are a school of communism . . . and on the
    other, they are—increasingly—a component part of the
    economic apparatus and of state administration in general”
    (Pravda, January 16).
That is where we find Comrade Bukharin’s fundamental
    theoretical mistake, which is substitution of eclecticism
    (especially popular with the authors of diverse
    “fashionable” and reactionary philosophical systems)
    for Marxist dialectics.
When Comrade Bukharin speaks of “logical” grounds,
    his whole reasoning shows that he takes—unconsciously,
    perhaps—the standpoint of formal or scholastic logic, and
    not of dialectical or Marxist logic. Let me explain this by taking
    the simple example which Comrade Bukharin himself gives. In the
    December 30 discussion he said:
 “Comrades, many of you may find that the
    current controversy suggests something like this: two men come in
    and invite each other to define the tumbler on the lectern. One
    says:‘It is a glass cylinder, and a curse on anyone who says
    different.’ The other one says:‘A tumbler is a
    drinking vessel, and a curse on anyone who says
    different’”(p. 46).
The reader will see that Bukharin’s example was meant to
    give me a popular explanation of the harm of one-track thinking. I
    accept it with gratitude, and in the one-good
    turn-deserves-another spirit offer a popular explanation of the
    difference between dialectics and eclecticism.
A tumbler is assuredly both a glass cylinder and a drinking
    vessel. But there are more than these two properties, qualities or
    facets to it; there are an infinite number of them, an infinite
    number of “mediacies” and inter-relationships with the
    rest of the world. A tumbler is a heavy object which can be used
    as a missile; it can serve as a paper weight, a receptacle for a
    captive butterfly, or a valuable object with an artistic engraving
    or design, and this has nothing at all to do with whether or not
    it can be used for drinking, is made of glass, is cylindrical or
    not quite, and so on and so forth.
Moreover, if I needed a tumbler just now for drinking, it would
    not in the least matter how cylindrical it was, and whether it was
    actually made of glass; what would matter though would be whether
    it had any holes in the bottom, or anything that would cut my lips
    when I drank, etc. But if I did not need a tumbler for drinking
    but for a purpose that could be served by any glass cylinder, a
    tumbler with a cracked bottom or without one at all would do just
    as well, etc.
Formal logic, which is as far as schools go (and should go,
    with suitable abridgements for the lower forms), deals with formal
    definitions, draws on what is most common, or glaring, and stops
    there. When two or more different definitions are taken and
    combined at random (a glass cylinder and a drinking vessel), the
    result is an eclectic definition which is indicative of different
    facets of the object, and nothing more.
 Dialectical logic demands that we should go further. Firstly,
    if we are to have a true knowledge of an object we must look at
    and examine all its facets, its connections and
    “mediacies”. That is something we cannot ever hope to
    achieve completely, but the rule of comprehensiveness is a
    safeguard against mistakes and rigidity. Secondly, dialectical
    logic requires that an object should be taken in development, in
    change, in “self-movement” (as Hegel sometimes puts
    it). This is not immediately obvious in respect of such an object
    as a tumbler, but it, too, is in flux, and this holds especially
    true for its purpose, use and connection with the
    surrounding world. Thirdly, a full “definition” of an
    object must include the whole of human experience, both as a
    criterion of truth and a practical indicator of its connection
    with human wants. Fourthly, dialectical logic holds that
    “truth is always concrete, never abstract”, as the
    late Plekhanov liked to say after Hegel. (Let me add in
    parenthesis for the benefit of young Party members that you
    cannot hope to become a real, intelligent
    Communist without making a study—and I mean
    study—of all of Plekhanov’s philosophical
    writings, because nothing better has been written on Marxism
    anywhere in the world.[3b])
 I have not, of course, run through the whole notion of
    dialectical logic, but what I have said will do for the present. I
    think we can return from the tumbler to the trade unions and
    Trotsky’s platform.
 “A school, on the one hand, and an apparatus on the
    other”, says Bukharin, and writes as much in his
    theses. Trotsky’s mistake is “insufficient support for
    the school-of-communism idea”; Zinoviev errs by being
    lukewarm on the apparatus “factor”.
Why is Bukharin’s reasoning no more than inert and empty
    eclecticism? It is because he does not even try to make an
    independent analysis, from his own standpoint, either of the whole
    course of the current controversy (as Marxism, that is,
    dialectical logic, unconditionally demands) or of the whole
    approach to the question, the whole presentation—the whole
    trend of the presentation, if you will—of the question at
    the present time and in these concrete circumstances. You do not
    see Bukharin doing that at all! His approach is one of pure
    abstraction: he makes no attempt at concrete study, and takes bits
    and pieces from Zinoviev and Trotsky. That is eclecticism.
Here is another example to clarify the picture. I know next to
    nothing about the insurgents and revolutionaries of South China
    (apart from the two or three articles by Sun Yat-sen, and a few
    books and newspaper articles I read many years ago). Since there
    are these uprisings, it is not too far-fetched to assume a
    controversy going on between Chinese No. 1, who says that the
    insurrection is the product of a most acute nation-wide class
    struggle, and Chinese No. 2, who says that insurrection is an
    art. That is all I need to know in order to write theses
    à la Bukharin: “On the one hand, . . . on the
    other hand”. The one has failed to reckon with the art
    “factor”, and the other, with the “acuteness
    factor”, etc. Because no concrete study is made of
    this particular controversy, question, approach, etc.,
    the result is a dead and empty eclecticism.
On the one hand, the trade unions are a school, and on the
    other, an apparatus; but they also happen to be an organisation of
    working people, an almost exclusive organisation of industrial
    workers, an organisation by industry, etc.[3c]
    Bukharin does not make any analysis for himself, nor does he
    produce a shred of evidence to prove why it is that we should
    consider the first two “facets” of the question or
    object, instead of the third, the fourth, the fifth, etc. That is
    why his group’s theses are an eclectic soap bubble. His
    presentation of the “school-apparatus” relationship is
    fundamentally eclectic and wrong.
The only way to view this question in the right light is to
    descend from empty abstractions to the concrete, that is, the
    present issue. Whether you take it in the form it assumed at the
    Fifth All-Russia Conference of Trade Unions, or as it was
    presented and slanted by Trotsky himself in his platform
    pamphlet of December 25, you will find that his whole
    approach is quite wrong and that he has gone off at a tangent. He
    has failed to understand that the trade unions can and must be
    viewed as a school both when raising the question of “Soviet
    trade-unionism”, and when speaking of production propaganda
    in general, and even when considering “coalescence”
    and trade union participation in industrial management, as
    Trotsky does. On this last point, as it is presented in
    Trotsky’s platform pamphlet, the mistake lies in his failure
    to grasp that the trade unions are a school of technical and
    administrative management of production. In the context of
    the controversy, you can not say: “a school, on the one
    hand, and something else on the other"; given Trotsky’s
    approach, the trade unions, whichever way you look at
    them, are a school. They are a school of unity,
    solidarity, management and administration, where you learn how to
    protect your interests. Instead of making an effort to comprehend
    and correct Comrade Trotsky’s fundamental mistake, Comrade
    Bukharin has produced a funny little amendment: “On the one
    hand, and on the other.”
Let us go deeper into the question. Let us see what the present
    trade unions are, as an “apparatus” of industrial
    management. We have seen from the incomplete returns that about
    900 workers—trade union members and delegates—are
    engaged in industrial management. If you multiply this number by
    10 or even by 100—if it helps to clarify your fundamental
    mistake let us assume this incredible speed of
    “advance” in the immediate future—you still have
    an insignificant proportion of those directly engaged in
    management, as compared with the mass of six million
    trade union members. This makes it even clearer that it is quite
    wrong to look to the “leading stratum”, and talk about
    the trade unions’ role in production and industrial
    management, as Trotsky does, forgetting that 98.5 per cent (6
    million minus 90,000 equals 5,910,000 or 98.5 per cent of the
    total) are learning, and will have to continue to do
    so for a long time to come. Don’t say school
    and management, say schooI of management.
In his December 30 argument against Zinoviev, whom he accused,
    quite groundlessly and incorrectly, of denying the
    “appointments system”, that is, the Central
    Committee’s right and duty to make appointments, Comrade
    Trotsky inadvertently drew the following telltale comparison:
 “Zinoviev tends to overdo the propaganda
    angle on every practical matter, forgetting that it is not only a
    source of material for agitation, but also a problem requiring an
    administrative solution” (p. 27).
Before I explain in detail the potential
    administrative approach to the issue, let me say that Comrade
    Trotsky’s fundamental mistake is that he treats (rather,
    maltreats) the questions he himself had brought up in his
    platform pamphlet as administrative ones, whereas
    they could be and ought to be viewed only from the
    propaganda angle.
In effect, what are Trotsky’s good points? One
    undoubtedly good and useful point is his production
    propaganda, but that is not in his theses, but in his
    speeches, specially when he forgets about his unfortunate polemics
    with the allegedly “conservative” wing of the
    trade-unionists. He would undoubtedly have done (and I believe he
    will do) a great deal of good in the trade union
    commission’s practical business, as speaker and writer, and
    as a member of the All-Russia Production Propaganda Bureau. His
    platform theses were a mistake, for through them, like a scarlet
    thread, runs the administrative approach to the
    “crisis” and the “two trends” within the
    trade unions, the interpretation of the R.C.P. Programme,
    “Soviet trade-unionism”, “production
    training” and “coalescence”. I have listed all
    the main points of Trotsky’s “platform “ and
    they all happen to be topics which, considering the material at
    Trotsky’s disposal, can be correctly approached at the
    present time only from the propaganda angle.
The state is a sphere of coercion. It would be madness to
    renounce coercion, especially in the epoch of the dictatorship of
    the proletariat, so that the administrative approach and
    “steerage” are indispensable. The Party is the leader,
    the vanguard of the proletariat, which rules directly. It is not
    coercion but expulsion from the Party that is the specific means
    of influence and the means of purging and steeling the
    vanguard. The trade unions are a reservoir of the state power, a
    school of communism and a school of management. The specific and
    cardinal thing in this sphere is not administration but
    the “ties ” “between the
    central state administration” (and, of course, the local as
    well), “the national economy and the broad masses
    of the working people” (see Party Programme, economic
    section, §5, dealing with the trade unions).
The whole of Trotsky’s platform pamphlet betrays an
    incorrect approach to the problem and a misunderstanding of this
    relationship.
Let us assume that Trotsky had taken a different approach to
    this famous question of “coalescence” in connection
    with the other topics of his platform, and that his pamphlet was
    entirely devoted to a detailed investigation of, say, 90 of the
    900 cases of “coalescence” where trade union officials
    and members concurrently held elective trade union posts and
    Supreme Economic Council posts in industrial management. Let us
    say these 90 cases had been analysed together with the returns of
    a selective statistical survey, the reports of inspectors and
    instructors of Rabkrin and the People’s Commissariats
    concerned: let us say they had been analysed in the light of the
    data supplied by the administrative bodies, the results of the
    work, the headway in production, etc. That would have been a
    correct administrative approach, and would have fullyy\ indicated
    the “shake-up” line, which implies concentrating
    attention on removals, transfers, appointments and the immediate
    demands to be made on the “leading stratum”. When
    Bukharin said in his January 3 speech, published by the Tsektran
    people in Petrograd, that Trotsky had at first wanted a
    “shake-up” but had now abandoned the idea, he made
    another one of his eclectical mistakes, which is ridiculous from
    the practical standpoint and theoretically inadmissible for a
    Marxist. He takes the question in the abstract, being unable (or
    unwilling) to get down to brass tacks. So long as we, the
    Party’s Central Committee and the whole Party, continue to
    run things, that is, govern, we shall never—we
    cannot—dispense with the “shake-up”, that is,
    removals, transfers, appointments, dismissals, etc. But
    Trotsky’s platform pamphlet deals with something else, and
    does not raise the “question of practical business” at
    all. It is not this but the “trends within the
    trade union movement” (Trotsky’s thesis 4, end) that
    was being debated by Zinoviev and Trotsky, Bukharin and myself,
    and in fact the whole Party.
This is essentially a political question. Because of the
    substance of the case—this concrete, particular “case
    “—it is impossible to correct Trotsky’s mistake
    by means of eclectic little amendments and addenda, as Bukharin
    has been trying to do, being moved undoubted]y by the most humane
    sentiments and intensions.
 There is only one answer.
First, there must be a correct solution of the political
    question of the “trends within the trade union
    movement”, the relationship between classes, between
    politics and economics, the specific role of the state, the Party,
    the trade unions, as “school” and apparatus, etc.
Second, once the correct political decision has been adopted, a
    diversified nation-wide production propaganda campaign must be
    carried through, or, rather, systematically carried forward with
    persistence and patience over a long term, under the sponsorship
    and direction of a state agency. It should be conducted in such a
    way as to cover the same ground over and over again.
Third, the “questions of practical business” must
    not be confused with trend issues which properly belong to the
    sphere ofgeneral Party talk” and broad discussions; they
    must be dealt with as practical matters in the working
    commissions, with a hearing of witnesses and a study of memoranda,
    reports and statistics. And any necessary “shake-up”
    must be carried out only on that basis and in those circumstances:
    only under a decision of the competent Soviet or Party organ, or
    of both.
Trotsky and Bukharin have produced a hodgepodge of political
    mistakes in approach, breaks in the middle of the transmission
    belts, and unwarranted and futile attacks on “administrative
    steerage”. It is now clear where the
    “theoretical” source of the mistake lies, since
    Bukharin has taken up that aspect of it with his example of the
    tumbler. His theoretical—in this case, gnosiological—
    mistake lies in his substitution of eclecticism for
    dialectics. His eclectic approach has confused him and has landed
    him in syndicalism. Trotsky’s mistake is one-track thinking,
    compulsiveness, exaggeration and obstinacy. His platform says that
    a tumbler is a drinking vessel, but this particular tumbler
    happens to have no bottom.
Conclusion
It remains for me to go over a few more points which must be
    dealt with to prevent misunderstanding.
Thesis 6 of Trotsky’s platform quotes Paragraph 5 of the
    economic section of the R.C.P. Programme, which deals with the
    trade unions. Two pages later, his thesis 8 says:
“Having lost the old basis of their existence, the class
    economic struggle, the trade unions. . . “ (that is wrong,
    and is a hasty exaggeration: the trade unions no longer have to
    face the class economic struggle but the non-class
    “economic struggle”, which means combating
    bureaucratic distortions of the Soviet apparatus, safeguarding the
    working people’s material and spiritual interests in ways
    and means inaccessible to this apparatus, etc. This is a struggle
    they will unfortunately have to face for many more years to
    come). “The trade unions,” says Trotsky, “have,
    for various reasons, not yet succeeded in mustering the necessary
    forces and working out the necessary methods enabling them to
    solve the new task, that of organising production ”
    (Trotsky’s italics, p. 9, thesis 8), “set before them
    by the proletarian revolution and formulated in our
    Programme.”
That is yet another hasty exaggeration which is pregnant with
    grave error. The Programme does not contain any such formulation
    nor does it set the trade unions the task of “organising
    production”. Let us go over the propositions in the
    Party’s Programme as they unfold in the text:
(1)"The organisational apparatus” (but not the others)
    “of socialised industry should rely chiefly” (but not
    exclusively) “on the trade unions.” (2)"They must to
    an ever increasing degree divest themselves of the narrow
    craft-union spirit” (how? under the leadership of the Party
    and through the proletariat’s educational and other
    influence on the non-proletarian mass of working people)
    “and become large industrial associations, embracing the
    majority, and eventually all of the workers in the given
    industry.”
That is the first part of the section of the Party Programme
    dealing with the trade unions. You will have noted that it starts
    by laying down very “strict conditions”
    demanding a long sustained effort for what is to follow. And what
    follows is this:
“The trade unions being, on the strength of the laws of
    the Soviet Republic and established practice, participants”
    (note the cautious statement: participants only) “in all the
    local and central organs of industrial management, should
    eventually arrive at a de facto concentration in their
    hands of the whole administration of the whole national economy,
    as a single economic entity” (note this: should arrive at a
    de facto concentration of management not of branches of
    industry and not of industry as a whole, but of the whole national
    economy, and moreover, as an economic entity. In economic terms,
    this condition may be considered fulfilled only when the petty
    producers both in industry and agriculture account for less than
    one-half of the population and the national economy). “The
    trade unions ensuring in this way” (the way which helps to
    realise all the conditions listed earlier) “indissoluble
    ties between the central state administration, the national
    economy and the broad masses of working people, should draw the
    latter” (that is, the masses, the majority of the
    population) “into direct economic management on the widest
    possible scale. At the same time, the participation of the trade
    unions in economic management and their activity in drawing the
    broad masses into this work are the principal means of combating
    the bureaucratisation of the economic apparatus of the Soviet
    power and making possible the establishment of truly popular
    control over the results of production.”
There again, in that last sentence, we find a very cautious
    phrase: “participation in economic management"; and another
    reference to the recruitment of the broad masses as the chief (but
    not the only) means of combating bureaucratic practices; finally,
    we find a highly cautious statement: “making possible
    ” the establishment of “popular
    ”—that is, workers’ and peasants’,
    and not just purely proletarian—“control
    ”.
It is obviously wrong to boil this down to the Party Programme
    “formulating” the trade unions’ task as
    “organisation of production”. And if you insist on
    this error, and write it into your platform theses, you will get
    nothing but an anti-communist, syndicalist deviation.
Incidentally, Comrade Trotsky says in his theses that
    “over the last period we have not made any headway towards
    the goal set forth in the Programme but have in fact retreated
    from it” (p. 7, thesis 6). That statement is unsupported,
    and, I think, wrong. It is no proof to say, as Trotsky did in the
    discussions, that the trade unions “themselves” admit
    this. That is not the last resort, as far as the Party is
    concerned, and, generally speaking, the proof lies only in a
    serious and objective study of a great number of facts. Moreover,
    even if such proof were forthcoming, there would remain this
    question: Why have we retreated? Is it because “many
    trade-unionists “ are “balking at the new tasks and
    methods”, as Trotsky believes, or because “we have not
    yet succeeded in mustering the necessary forces and working out
    the necessary methods” to cut short and correct certain
    unwarranted and harmful excesses of bureaucracy?
Which brings me to Bukharin’s rebuke of December 30
    (repeated by Trotsky yesterday, January 24, during our discussion
    in the Communist group of the Second Miners’ Congress) that
    we have “dropped the line laid down by the Ninth Party
    Congress” (p. 46 of the report on the December 30
    discussion). He alleged that at that Congress I had defended the
    militarisation of labour and had jeered at references to
    democracy, all of which I now “repudiate”. In his
    reply to the debate on December 30, Comrade Trotsky added this
    barb: “Lenin takes account of the fact that . . . there is a
    grouping of opposition-minded comrades within the trade
    unions” (p. 65); that I view it from the “diplomatic
    angle” (p. 69), and that there is “manoeuvring inside
    the Party groups” (p. 70), etc. Putting such a complexion on
    the case is, of course, highly flattering for Trotsky, and worse
    than unflattering for me. But let us look at the facts.
In that same discussion on December 30, Trotsky and Krestinsky
    established the fact that “as long ago as July (1920),
    Comrade Preobrazhensky had proposed to the Central Committee that
    we should switch to a new track in respect of the internal life of
    our workers’ organisations” (p. 25). In August,
    Comrade Zinoviev drafted a letter, and the Central Committee
    approved a C.C. Letter on combating red-tape and
    extending democracy. In September, the question was brought up at
    a Party conference whose decisions were endorsed by the Central
    Committee. In December, the question of combating red-tape was
    laid before the Eighth Congress of Soviets. Consequently, the
    whole Central Committee, the whole Party and the whole
    workers’ and peasants’ Republic had recognised that
    the question of the bureaucracy and ways of combating its evils
    was high on the agenda. Does any “repudiation” of the
    Ninth Congress of the R.C.P. follow from all this? Of course,
    not. The decisions on the militarisation of labour, etc., are
    incontestable, and there is no need for me at all to withdraw any
    of my jibes at the references to democracy by those who challenged
    these decisions. What does follow is that we shall be extending
    democracy in the workers’ organisations, without turning it
    into a fetish; that we shall redouble our attention to the
    struggle against bureaucratic practices; and that we shall take
    special care to rectify any unwarranted and harmful excesses of
    bureaucracy, no matter who points them out.
One final remark on the minor question of priority and
    equalisation. I said during the December 30 discussion that
    Trotsky’s formulation of thesis 41 on this point was
    theoretically wrong, because it implied priority in production and
    equalisation in consumption. I replied that priority implied
    preference and that that was nothing unless you also had it in
    consumption. Comrade Trotsky reproached me for
    “extraordinary forgetfulness” and
    “intimidation” (pp. 67 and 68), and I am surprised to
    find that he has not accused me also of manoeuvring, diplomatic
    moves, etc. He has made “concessions” to my
    equalitarian line, but I have attacked him.
Actually, however, anyone who takes an interest in Party
    affairs, can turn to indisputable Party documents: the November
    resolution of the C.C. Plenum, point 4, and Trotsky’s
    platform pamphlet, thesis 41. However “forgetful” I
    may be, and however excellent Comrade Trotsky’s memory, it
    is still a fact that thesis 41 contains a theoretical error, which
    the C.C. resolution of November 9 does not. The resolution says:
    “While recognising the necessity of keeping to the principle
    of priority in carrying out the economic plan, the Central
    Committee, in complete solidarity with the decisions of the last
    All-Russia Conference (September), deems it necessary to effect a
    gradual but steady transition to equality in the status of various
    groups of workers and their respective trade unions, all the while
    building up the organisation on the scale of the union as a
    whole.” That is clearly aimed against Tsektran, and it is
    quite impossible to put any other construction on the exact
    meaning of the resolution. Priority is here to stay. Preference is
    still to be given to enterprises, trade unions, trusts and
    departments on the priority list (in regard to fulfilment of the
    economic plan), but at the same time, the “equalitarian
    line”—which was supported not by “Comrade Lenin
    alone”, but was approved by the Party Conference and the
    Central Committee, that is, the entire Party—makes this
    clear-cut demand: get on with the gradual but steady
    transition to equalisation. That Tsektran failed to carry
    out this C.C. resolution (November) is evident from the Central
    Committee’s December resolution (on Trotsky and
    Bukharin’s motion), which contains another reminder of the
    “principles of ordinary democracy”. The theoretical
    error in thesis 41 is that it says: equalisation in consumption,
    priority in production. That is an economic absurdity because it
    implies a gap between production and consumption. I did not
    say—and could never have said—anything of the sort. If
    you don’t need a factory, close it down. Close down all the
    factories that are not absolutely essential, and give preference
    to those that are. Give preference to, say, transport. Most
    certainly. But the preference must not be overdone, as it was in
    Tsektran’s case, which was why the Party (and not
    just Lenin) issued this directive: get on with the
    gradual but steady transition to equality.

      And Trotsky has no one but himself to blame for having come
      out—after the November Plenary Meeting, which gave a
      clear-cut and theoretically correct solution—with a
      factional pamphlet on “the two trends” and proposed a
      formulation in his thesis 41 which is wrong in economic
      terms. 
*     *

Today, January 25, it is exactly one month since Comrade
    Trotsky’s factional statement. It is now patent that this
    pronouncement, inappropriate in form and wrong in essence, has
    diverted the Party from its practical economic and production
    effort into rectifying political and theoretical mistakes. But,
    it’s an ill wind, as the old saying goes.
Rumour has it that some terrible things have been said about
    the disagreements on the Central Committee. Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries undoubtedly shelter (and have sheltered)
    behind the opposition, and it is they who are spreading the
    rumours, incredibly malicious formulations, and inventions of all
    sorts to malign the Party, put vile interpretations on its
    decisions, aggravate conflicts and ruin its work. That is a
    political trick used by the bourgeoisie, including the
    petty-bourgeois democrats, the Mensheviks and the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries, who, for very obvious reasons,
    hate—and cannot help hating—the Bolsheviks’
    guts. Every intelligent member of the Party is familiar with this
    political trick, and knows its worth.
Because of the disagreements on the Central Committee, it had
    to appeal to the Party, and the discussions that followed clearly
    revealed the essence and scope of these disagreements. That killed
    the rumours and the slander. The Party learns its lessons and is
    tempered in the struggle against factionalism, a new malaise (it
    is new in the sense that after the October Revolution we had
    forgotten all about it). Actually, it is an old malaise, with
    relapses apparently bound to occur over the next few years, but
    with an easier cure now well in sight.
The Party is learning not to blow up its disagreements. Let me
    quote at this point Comrade Trotsky’s correct remark about
    Comrade Tomsky: “I have always said —even when the
    polemic against Comrade Tomsky was at its bitterest—that it
    is quite clear to me that only men with his experience and
    authority ought to be our trade union leaders. I told this to the
    Party group of the Fifth Conference of the Trade Unions, and
    repeated it at the Zimin theatre a few days ago. Ideological
    struggle within the Party does not mean mutual ostracism but
    mutual influence”[4] (p. 34 of the report on the December
    30 discussion). The Party will naturally apply this correct
    approach to Comrade Trotsky himself.
During the discussion it was Comrade Shlyapnikov and his group,
    the so-called Workers’ Opposition, who showed the most
    pronounced syndicalist trend. This being an obvious deviation from
    communism and the Party, we shall have to reckon with it, talk it
    over, and make a special propaganda effort to explain the error of
    these views and the danger of making such mistakes. Comrade
    Bukharin, who actually coined the syndicalist phrase
    “mandatory nominations” (by trade unions to management
    bodies) tries to vindicate himself in today’s issue of
    Pravda, but I’m afraid his line of defence is
    highly ineffective and quite wrong. He wants us to know, you see,
    that he deals with the role of the Party in his other points. I
    should think so! If it were otherwise it would have been more than
    just a mistake, requiring correction and allowing some
    slight rectification: it would have been withdrawal from the
    Party. When you say “mandatory nominations” but
    neglect to add, there and then, that they are not
    mandatory for the Party, you have a syndicalist deviation, and
    that is incompatible with communism and the Party
    Programme If you add: “mandatory but not for the
    Party” you are giving the non-Party workers a false sense of
    having some increase in their rights, whereas in fact there will
    be no change at all. The longer Comrade Bukharin persists in his
    deviation from communism—a deviation that is wrong
    theoretically and deceptive politically—the more deplorable
    will be the fruits of his obstinacy. You cannot maintain an
    untenable proposition. The Party does not object to the extension
    of the rights of the non-Party workers in general, but a little
    reflection will show what can and what cannot be done in this
    respect. 
In the discussion by the Communist group of the Second
    All-Russia Miners’ Congress, Shlyapnikov’s platform
    was defeated despite the backing it got from Comrade Kiselyov, who
    commands special prestige in that union: our platform won 137
    votes, Shlyapnikov’s, 62, and Trotsky’s, 8. The
    syndicalist malaise must and will be cured.
In this one month, Petrograd, Moscow and a number of provincial
    towns have shown that the Party responded to the discussion and
    has rejected Comrade Trotsky’s wrong line by an overwhelming
    majority. While there may have been some vacillation “at the
    top” and “in the provinces”, in the committees
    and in the offices, the rank-and-file membership—the mass of
    Party workers—came out solidly against this wrong line.
Comrade Kamenev informed me of Comrade Trotsky’s
    announcement, during the discussion in the Zamoskvorechye District
    of Moscow on January 23, that he was withdrawing his platform and
    joining up with the Bukharin group on a new
    platform. Unfortunately, I heard nothing of this from Comrade
    Trotsky either on January 23 or 24, when he spoke against me in
    the Communist group of the Miners’ Congress. I don’t
    know whether this is due to another change in Comrade
    Trotsky’s platform and intentions, or to some other
    reason. In any case, his January 23 announcement shows that the
    Party, without so much as mustering all its forces, and with only
    Petrograd, Moscow and a minority of the provincial towns going on
    record, has corrected Comrade Trotsky’s mistake promptly and
    with determination.
The Party’s enemies had rejoiced too soon. They have not
    been able—and will never be able—to take advantage of
    some of the inevitable disagreements within the Party to inflict
    harm on it and on the dictatorship of the proletariat in
    Russia.

    Lenin began writing the pamphlet on January 21 or 22, 1921, in
    Gorki where he was taking a rest. Upon his return to Moscow on
    January 22, he handed the greater part of the pamphlet to his
    secretary for typing. He finished the work on January 25 and had
    it sent to the printer’s. Late on January 26, C.C. members
    who were going to attend local discussions of the trade
    unions’ role and tasks were given copies of the printed
    pamphlet, while the rest of the copies were ready on January
    27.

Petrogradskaya Pravda (Petrograd Truth
    )—a daily published from April 2, 1918, as the organ of
    the Bolshevik Central and Petrograd Party Committees. Since
    January 1924, it has been appearing as Leningradskaya
    Pravda. 
[3]
    V. I. Zoff’s circular of May 3, 1920, was published in the
    Bulleten Mariinskogo Oblastnogo Upravlenia Vodnogo
    Transporta (Bulletin of the Mariinsky Regional Water
    Transport Administration ) No. 5, 1920. It ran: “A
    great change is about to occur in the life of water transport:
    primitive methods, committee treadmill, haphazard work and anarchy
    are on the way out. Water transport is becoming a state
    enterprise, headed by political commissars with appropriate
    powers. Committees, trade unions and elected delegates will no
    longer have the power to interfere in technical and administrative
    matters.” 
[3b] By the way, it would be a good thing, first,
    if the current edition of Plekhanov’s works contained a
    special volume or volumes of all his philosophical articles, with
    detailed indexes, etc., to be included in a series of standard
    textbooks on communism; secondly I think the workers’ state
    must demand that professors of philosophy should have a knowledge
    of Plekhanov’s exposition of Marxist philosophy and ability
    to impart it to their students. But all that is a digression from
    “propaganda” to
    “administration”—Lenin. 
[3c]Incidentally, here again Trotsky makes a
    mistake. He thinks that an industrial union is designed to control
    industry. That is wrong. When you say that a union is an
    industrial one you mean that it admits to membership workers in
    one industry, which is inevitable at the present level of
    technology and culture (in Russia and
    elsewhere).—Lenin. 
The order was an example of administration by
    injunction and bureaucratic practices, which Tsektran’s
    leadership was introducing, and was evidence of their
    misunderstanding of the trade unions’ role in getting
    transport back on its feet. The trade unions were equated with
    outdated army committees, and barred by order from taking part in
    improving water transport operations.
[4]
    On December 24, 1920, in what used to be the Zimin theatre,
    Trotsky gave a report on the trade unions tasks in production at a
    joint meeting of trade union activists and delegates to the Eighth
    All-Russia Congress of Soviets, called by the Central Committee of
    the Joint Union of Rail and Water Transport Workers. It started
    the open Party discussion on the trade unions.

      What is being said and written on this subject leaves a very
      painful impression. Take L. Kritsman’s articles in
      Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn [1] (I—December
      14, 1920; II—December 23; III—February 9;
      IV—February 16; and V—February 20). There is nothing
      there but empty talk and word-spinning, a refusal to consider
      and look into what has been done in this field. Five long
      articles of reflection on how to approach the study of facts and
      data, instead of any actual examination of them.

      Take Milyutin ’s theses (Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn,
      February 19), or Larin’s (ibid., February 20); listen to
      the speeches of “responsible” comrades: they all
      have the same basic defects as Kritsman’s articles. They
      all reveal the dullest sort of scholasticism, including a lot of
      twaddle about the law of concatenation, etc. It is a
      scholasticism that ranges from the literary to the bureaucratic,
      to the exclusion of all practical effort.

      But what is even worse is the highbrow bureaucratic disdain for
      the vital work that has been done and that needs to be
      continued. Again and again there is the emptiest “drawing
      up of theses” and a concoction of plans and slogans, in
      place of painstaking and thoughtful study of our own practical
      experience.

      The only serious work on the subject is the Plan for the
      Electrification of the R.S.F.S.R., the report of GOELRO
      (the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia) to the
      Eighth Congress of Soviets, published in December 1920 and
      distributed at the Congress. It outlines an integrated economic
      plan which has been worked out—only as a rough
      approximation, of course—by the best brains in  the
      Republic on the instructions of its highest bodies. We have to
      make a very modest start in fighting the complacency born of the
      ignorance of the grandees, and the intellectualist conceit of
      the Communist literati, by telling the story of this book, and
      describing its content and significance .   

    

      More than a year
      ago—February 2-7, 1920—the All-Russia Central
      Executive Committee met in session and adopted a resolution on
      electrification which says: 

      “ Along with the most immediate, vital and urgent tasks in
      organising transport, coping with the fuel and food crises,
      fighting epidemics, and forming disciplined labour armies,
      Soviet Russia now has, for the first time, an opportunity of
      starting on more balanced economic development, and working out
      a nation-wide state economic plan on scientific lines and
      consistently implementing it. In view of the prime importance of
      electrification . . . mindful of the importance of
      electrification for industry, agriculture and transport,
      . . . and so on and so forth . . . , the Committee resolves: to
      authorise the Supreme Economic Council to work out, in
      conjunction with the People’s Commissariat for
      Agriculture, a project for the construction of a system of
      electric power stations. . . .”

      This seems to be clear enough, doesn’t it? “A
      nationwide state economic plan on scientific lines": is it
      possible to misread these words in the decision adopted by our
      highest authority? If the literati and the grandees, who boast
      of their communism before the “experts”, are
      ignorant of this decision it remains for us to remind them that
      ignorance of our laws is no argument.

      In pursuance of the All-Russia C.E.C. resolution, the Presidium
      of the Supreme Economic Council, on February 21, 1920, confirmed
      the Electrification Commission set up under the Electricity
      Department, after which the Council of Defence endorsed the
      statute on GOELRO, whose composition the Supreme Economic
      Council was instructed to determine and confirm by agreement
      with the People ’s Commissariat for Agriculture. On April
      24, 1920, GOELRO issued its Bulletin No. 1,[2]
      containing a detailed programme of works and a list of the
      responsible persons, scientists, engineers, agronomists and
      statisticians on the several subcommissions to direct operations
      in the various areas, together with the specific assignments
      each had undertaken. The list of persons and their assignments
      runs  to ten printed pages of Bulletin No. 1. The best
      talent available to the Supreme Economic Council, the
      People’s Commissariat for Agriculture and the
      People’s Commissariat for Communications has been
      recruited.

      The GOELRO effort has produced this voluminous—and
      first-class—scientific publication. Over 180 specialists
      worked on it. There are more than 200 items on the list of works
      they have submitted to GOELRO. We find, first, a summary of
      these works (the first part of the volume, running to over 200
      pages): a) electrification and a state economic plan; followed
      by b) fuel supply (with a detailed “fuel budget” for
      the R.S.F.S.R. over the next ten years, with an
      estimate of the manpower required); c) water power; d)
      agriculture; e) transport; and f) industry.

      The plan ranges over about ten years and gives an indication of
      the number of workers and capacities (in 1,000 hp). Of course,
      it is only a rough draft, with possible errors, and a
      “rough approximation”, but it is a real scientific
      plan. We have precise calculations by experts for every major
      item, and every industry. To give a small example, we have their
      calculations for the output of leather, foot wear at two pairs a
      head (300 million pairs), etc. As a result, we have a material
      and a financial (gold rubles) balance sheet for electrification
      (about 370 million working days, so many barrels of cement, so
      many bricks, poods of iron, copper, and other things; turbine
      generator capacities, etc.). It envisages (“at a very
      rough estimate”) an 80 per cent increase in manufacturing,
      and 80-100 per cent, in extracting industry over the next ten
      years. The gold balance deficit (+ 11,000 million - 17,000
      million leaves a total deficit of about 6,000 million)
      “can be covered by means of concessions and credit
      operations".

      It gives the site of the first 20 steam and 10 water power
      district electric stations, and a detailed description of the
      economic importance of each.

      The general summary is followed, in the same volume, by a list
      of works for each area (with a separate paging): Northern,
      Central Industrial (both of which are especially well set out in
      precise detail based on a wealth of scientific data), Southern,
      Volga, Urals? Caucasian (the Caucasus is taken as a whole in
      anticipation of an economic agreement between its various
      republics), Western Siberia and Turkestan. For each of the
      areas, electric power capacities are projected beyond the first
      limits; this is followed by the “GOELRO Programme
      A”, that is, the plan for the use of existing
      electric power stations on the most rational and economic
      lines. Here is another small example: it is estimated that a
      grid of the Petrograd stations (Northern Area) could yield the
      following economy (p. 69): up to one-half of the capacities
      could be diverted to the logging areas of the North, such as
      Murmansk and Archangel, etc. The resulting increase in the
      output and export of timber could yield “up to 500
      million rubles’ worth of foreign exchange a year in the
      immediate period ahead”.

      “ Annual receipts from the sale of our northern timber
      could very well equal our gold reserves over the next few
      years” (ibid., p. 70), provided, of course, we stop
      talking about plans and start studying and applying the
      plan already worked out by our scientists.

      Let me add that we have an embryonic calendar programme for a
      number of other items (though not for all, of course). This is
      more than a general plan: it is an estimate for each year, from
      1921 to 1930, of the number of stations that can be run in, and
      the proportions to which the existing ones can be enlarged,
      provided again we start doing what I have just said, which is
      not easy in view of the ways of our intellectualist literati and
      bureaucratic grandees. 

    

         
      A look at Germany will bring out the dimensions and value of
      GOELRO’s effort. Over there, the scientist Ballod produced
      a similar work: he compiled a scientific plan for the socialist
      reconstruction of the whole national economy of Germany.[3] But his being a capitalist country,
      the plan never got off the ground. It remains a lone-wolf
      effort, and an exercise in literary composition. With us over
      here it was a state assignment, mobilising hundreds of
      specialists and producing an integrated economic plan on
      scientific lines within 10 months (and not two, of course, as we
      had originally planned). We have every right to be proud of this
      work, and it remains for us to understand how it should
      be used. What we now have to contend with is failure to
      understand this fact.

      The resolution of the Eighth Congress of Soviets says:
      “The Congress . . . approves the work of the Supreme
      Economic Council, etc., especially that of GOELRO in
      drawing up the plan for the electrification of Russia
      . . . regards this plan as the first step in a great
      economic endeavour, authorises the All-Russia Central
      Executive Committee, etc., to put the finishing touches to
      the plan and to endorse it, at the very earliest
      date. . . . It authorises the adoption of all measures for the
      most extensive popularisation of this plan. . . . A
      study of this plan must be an item in the curricula of all
      educational establishments of the Republic, without
      exception”,[4] etc.

      The bureaucratic and intellectualist defects of our apparatus,
      especially of its top drawer, are most glaringly revealed by the
      attitude to this resolution taken by some people in Moscow and
      their efforts to twist it, to the extent of ignoring it
      altogether. Instead of advertising the plan, the literati
      produce theses and empty disquisitions on how to start working
      out a plan. The grandees, in purely bureaucratic fashion, lay
      stress on the need to “approve” the plan, by which
      they do not mean concrete assignments (the dates for the
      construction of the various installations, the purchase of
      various items abroad, etc.) but some muddled idea, such as
      working out a new plan. The misunderstanding this
      produces is monstrous, and there is talk of partially restoring
      the old before getting on with the new. Electrification, it is
      said, is something of an “electrofiction". Why not
      gasification, we are asked; GOELRO, they also say, is full of
      bourgeois specialists, with only a handful of Communists; GOELRO
      should provide the cadre of experts, instead of staffing the
      general planning commission, and so forth.

      The danger lies in this discord, for it betrays an inability to
      work, and the prevalence of intellectualist and bureaucratic
      complacency, to the exclusion of all real effort. The conceited
      ignoramus is betrayed by his jibes at the
      “fantastic” plan, his questions about gasification,
      etc. The nerve of their trying, offhand, to pick holes in
      something it took an army of first-class specialists to produce!
      Isn’t it a shame to try to shrug it off with trite little
      jokes, and to put on airs about one’s right “to
      withhold approval"?

      It is time we learned to put a value on science and got  rid of
      the “communist” conceit of the dabbler and the
      bureaucrat; it is time we learned to work systematically, making
      use of our own experience and practice.

      Of course, “plans” naturally give rise to endless
      argument and discussion, but when the task is to get down to the
      study of the only scientific plan before us, we should not allow
      ourselves to engage in general statements and debates about
      underlying “principles". We should get down to correcting
      it on the strength of practical experience and a more
      detailed study. Of course, the grandees always retain the right
      to “give or withhold approval". A sober view of this
      right, and a reasonable reading of the resolution of the Eighth
      Congress concerning the approval of the plan, which it endorsed
      and handed down to us for the broadest popularisation, show that
      approval must be taken to mean the placing of a series of orders
      and the issue of a set of instructions, such as the items to be
      purchased, the building to be started, the materials to be
      collected and forwarded, etc. Upon the other hand,
      “approval” from the bureaucratic standpoint means
      arbitrary acts on the part of the grandees, the red-tape
      runaround, the commissions-of-inquiry game, and the strictly
      bureaucratic foul-up of anything that is going.

      Let us look at the matter from yet another angle. There is a
      special need to tie in the scientific plan for electrification
      with existing short-term plans and their actual
      implementation. That this must be done is naturally beyond
      doubt. But how is it to be done? To find out, the economists,
      the literati, and the statisticians should stop their twaddle
      about the plan in general, and get on with a detailed study of
      the implementation of our plans, our mistakes in this practical
      business, and ways of correcting them. Otherwise we shall have
      to grope our way long. Over and above such a study of our
      practical experience, there remains the very small matter of
      administrative technique. Of planning commissions we have more
      than enough. Take two men from the department under Ivan
      Ivanovich and integrate them with one from the department under
      Pavel Pavlovich, or vice versa. Link them up with a
      subcommission of the general planning commission. All of which
      boils down to administrative technique. Various combinations
      should be tried out, and the best selected. That is
      elementary.

      The whole point is that we have yet to learn the art of
      approach, and stop substituting intellectualist and bureaucratic
      projecteering for vibrant effort. We have, and have had,
      short-term food and fuel plans, and there are glaring mistakes
      in both. That is unquestionable. But the efficient economist,
      instead of penning empty theses, will get down to a study of the
      facts and figures, and analyse our own practical experience. He
      will pin-point the mistakes and suggest a remedy. This kind of
      study will suggest to the efficient administrator the transfers,
      alterations of records, recasting of the machinery, etc., to be
      proposed or put through. You don’t find us doing anything
      of the sort.

      The main flaw is in the wrong approach to the relationships
      between the Communists and the specialists, the administrators
      and the scientists and writers. There is no doubt at all that
      some aspects of the integrated economic plan, as of any other
      undertaking, call for the administrative approach or for
      decisions by Communists alone. Let me add that new aspects of
      that kind can always come to the fore. That, however, is the
      purely abstract way of looking at it. Right now, our communist
      writers and administrators are taking quite the wrong approach,
      because they have failed to realise that in this case we should
      be learning all we can from the bourgeois specialists and
      scientists, and cutting out the administrative
      game. GOELRO’s is the only integrated economic plan we can
      hope to have just now. It should be amplified, elaborated,
      corrected and applied in the light of well scrutinised practical
      experience. The opposite view boils down to the purely
      “pseudo-radical conceit, which in actual fact is nothing
      but ignorance”, as our Party Programme puts it.[5] Ignorance and conceit are equally
      betrayed by the view that we can have another general planning
      commission in the R.S.F.S.R. in addition to GOELRO, which, of
      course, is not to deny that some advantage may be gained from
      partial and business-like changes in its membership. It is only
      on this basis—by continuing what has been
      started—that we can hope to make any serious improvements
      in the general economic  plan; any other course will involve us
      in an administrative game, or high-handed action, to put it
      bluntly. The task of the Communists inside GOELRO is to issue
      fewer orders, rather, to refrain from issuing any at all, and to
      be very tactful in their dealings with the scientists and
      technicians (the R.C.P. Programme says: “Most of them
      inevitably have strong bourgeois habits and take the bourgeois
      view of things”). The task is to learn from them and to
      help them to broaden their world-view on the basis of
      achievements in their particular field, always bearing in mind
      that the engineer’s way to communism is different
      from that of the underground propagandist and the writer; he is
      guided along by the evidence of his own science, so
      that the agronomist, the forestry expert, etc., each have their
      own path to tread towards communism. The Communist who has
      failed to prove his ability to bring together and guide the work
      of specialists in a spirit of modesty, going to the heart of the
      matter and studying it in detail, is a potential menace. We have
      many such Communists among us, and I would gladly swap dozens of
      them for one conscientious qualified bourgeois specialist.

      There are two ways in which Communists outside GOELRO can help
      to establish and implement the integrated economic plan. Those
      of them who are economists, statisticians or writers should
      start by making a study of our own practical experience, and
      suggest corrections and improvements only after such a detailed
      study of the facts. Research is the business of the scientist,
      and once again, because we are no longer dealing with general
      principles, but with practical experience, we find that we can
      obtain much more benefit from a “specialist in science and
      technology”, even if a bourgeois one, than from the
      conceited Communist who is prepared, at a moment’s notice,
      to write “theses”, issue “slogans” and
      produce meaningless abstractions. What we need is more factual
      knowledge and fewer debates on ostensible communist
      principles.

      Upon the other hand, the Communist administrator’s prime
      duty is to see that he is not carried away by the issuing of
      orders. He must learn to start by looking at the achievements of
      science, insisting on a verification of the facts, and locating
      and studying the mistakes (through reports, articles in the
      press, meetings, etc.), before proceeding with any
      corrections. We need more practical studies of our mistakes, in
      place of the Tit Titych[6] type of tactics
      (“I might give my approval, if I feel like it”).

      Men’s vices, it has long been known, are for the most part
      bound up with their virtues. This, in fact, applies to many
      leading Communists. For decades, we had been working for the
      great cause, preaching the overthrow of the bourgeoisie,
      teaching men to mistrust the bourgeois specialists, to expose
      them, deprive them of power and crush their resistance. That is
      a historic cause of world-wide significance. But it needs only a
      slight exaggeration to prove the old adage that there is only
      one step from the sublime to the ridiculous. Now that we have
      convinced Russia, now that we have wrested Russia from the
      exploiters and given her to the working people, now that we have
      crushed the exploiters, we must learn to run the country. This
      calls for modesty and respect for the efficient
      “specialists in science and technology”, and a
      business-like and careful analysis of our numerous practical
      mistakes, and their gradual but steady correction. Let us have
      less of this intellectualist and bureaucratic complacency, and a
      deeper scrutiny of the practical experience being gained in the
      centre and in the localities, and of the available achievements
      of science.

 Remark On The Amendment Of Rafail (B. B. Farbman)

 To The Resolution On Party Unity March

16[4] 

I don’t think this amendment ought to be adopted. When this
discussion started we did not keep to the division in Pravda—political
articles got mixed up with discussion

    

articles. We say here in an emphasised but not ultimatum form that these
should not be dragged into the press.

 Remark On Kiselyov’s Speech Concerning The Resolution On Party Unity
March

16[5] 

Comrades, I am very sorry that I used the word
“machinegun” and hereby give a solemn promise never to use such words
again even figuratively, for they only scare people and afterwards you
can’t make out what they want. (Applause.) Nobody intends to shoot
at anybody with a machine-gun and we are sure that neither Comrade Kiselyov
nor anybody else will have cause to do so.

Remark On Marchenko’s Amendment To The Resolution On The Anarchist And
Syndicalist Deviation March

16[6] 

To say this in the name of the congress is far too
prohibitive. I move that this amendment should not be adopted, without, of
course, depriving the C.C. of the right to recommend, and in case of need,
to concentrate all this in C.C.

    

publications: but I think it would be too much to have a congress ban on
the issue of such publications locally.

Notes
 
 



[1]
The Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.)  was held in Moscow on
March 8-16, 1921. It was attended, according to the report of the Mandate
Commission, by 694 voting delegates and 296 delegates with a voice but no
vote, representing 732,521 Party members. The items on the agenda were: 1)
Report of the Central Committee; 2) Report of the Control Commission; 3)
The trade unions and their role in the country’s economic life; 4) The
Socialist Republic in a capitalist encirclement, foreign trade,
conces-sions, etc.; 5) Food supply, the surplus-appropriation system, the
tax in kind and the fuel crisis; 6) Questions of Party organisation; 7) The
Party’s current tasks in the national question; 8) Reorganisation of the
army and the militia question; 9) The Chief Committee for Political
Education and the Party’s pro- paganda and agitation work; 10) Report of
the R . C.P.’s representative in the Comintern and its current tasks; 11)
Report of the R.C.P.’s representative in the International Trade Union
Council; 12) Elections to the Central Committee, the Control Commission and
the Auditing Commission.


The congress passed decisions on cardinal issues
pertaining to the country’s political and economic life. The work of the
congress was guided by Lenin, who delivered the opening and closing
speeches and made reports on the political activities of the C.C., the
substitution of a tax in kind for the surplus grain appropriation system,
Party unity and the anarcho-syndicalist deviation, the trade unions, and
the fuel question.  Lenin drafted the major resolutions for the
congress. See also present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 165-271. 



[2]
The meeting of the supporters of the ’,Platform of Ten" referred to
here apparently took place on the eve of the congress or early in its
proceedings-on March 8 or 9, 1921.  



[3]
This point was elaborated by Lenin in Point 7 of his preliminary draft
resolution on Party unity adopted by the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.)
(see present edition, Vol. 32, pp. 241-44).  



[4]
The amendment of Rafail (R. B. Farbman) to Point 4 of the resolution on
Party unity proposed adding that moot points "be discussed at general
meetings and in the press". The amendment was rejected. 



[5]
A. S. Kiselyov came out against Point 7 of the resolution on Party
unity, in which the Central Committee was authorised to

resort to the extreme measure of expulsion from the Party in the case of
C.C. members guilty of factional activities. In his speech Kiselyov stated
that Lenin, in describing the significance of this point, had used the
expression “mounting machine-guns”.  



[6]
The amendment of K. I. Marchenko applied to Point 6 of the resolution
’On the Syndicalist and Anarchist Deviation in Our Party" (see present
edition, Vol. 32, p. 248). Marchenko pro-posed to include in the resolution
that discussion publications be issued only by the C.C. of the R.C.P,(B,)
or by the Regional Bureaux of the CC. The amendment was rejected.

In Lieu Of Introduction


The question of the tax in kind is at present attracting very great attention and is giving rise to much discussion and argument. This is quite natural, because in present conditions it is indeed one of the principal questions of policy.


The discussion is somewhat disordered, a fault to which, for very obvious reasons, we must all plead guilty. All the more useful would it be, therefore, to try to approach the question, not from its âtopicalâ aspect, but from the aspect of general principle. In other words, to examine the general, fundamental background of the picture on which we are now tracing the pattern of definite practical measures of present-day policy.


In order to make this attempt I will take the liberty of quoting a long passage from my pamphlet, The Chief Task of Our Day âLeft-Wingâ Childishness and the Petty-Bourgeois Mentality. It was published by the Petrograd Soviet of Workersâ and Soldiersâ Deputies in 1918 and contains, first, a newspaper article, dated March 11, 1918, on the Brest Peace, and, second, my polemic against the then existing group of Left Communists, dated May 5, 1918. The polemic is now superfluous and I omit it, leaving what appertains to the discussion on ,âstate capitalismâ an the main elements of our present-day economy, which is transitional from capitalism to socialism.


Here is what I wrote at the time: 


The Present-Day Economy Of Russia
(Extract From The 1918 Pamphlet)


State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our Soviet Republic. If in approximately six monthsâ time state capitalism became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm hold and will have become invincible in this country.


I can imagine with what noble indignation some people will recoil from these words.... What! The transition to state capitalism in the Soviet Socialist Republic would be a step forward? ... Isnât this the betrayal of socialism?


We must deal with this point in greater detail.


Firstly, we must examine the nature of the transition from capitalism to socialism that gives us the right and the grounds to call our country a Socialist Republic of Soviets.


Secondly, we must expose the error of those who fail to see the petty-bourgeois economic conditions and the petty-bourgeois element as the principal enemy of socialism in our country.


Thirdly, we must fully understand the economic implications of the distinction between the Soviet state and the bourgeois state.


Let us examine these three points.


No one, I think, in studying the question of the economic system of Russia, has denied its transitional character. Nor, I think, has any Communist denied that the term Soviet Socialist Republic implies the determination of the Soviet power to achieve the transition to socialism, and not that the existing economic system is recognised as a socialist order.


But what does the word âtransitionâ mean? Does it not mean, as applied to an economy, that the present system contains elements, particles, fragments of both capitalism and socialism? Everyone will admit that it does. But not all who admit this take the trouble to consider what elements actually constitute the various socio-economic structures that exist in Russia at the present time. And this is the crux of the question. 


Let us enumerate these elements:


(1)patriarchal, i.e., to a considerable extent natural, peasant farming;


(2)small commodity production (this includcs the majority of those peasants who sell their grain);


(3)private capitalism;


(4)state capitalism;


(5)socialism.


Russia is so vast and so varied that all these different types of socio-economic structures are intermingled. This is what constitutes the specific feature of the situation.


The question arises: What elements predominate? Clearly, in a small-peasant country, the petty-bourgeois element predominates and it must predominate, for the great majorityâthose working the landâare small commodity producers. The shell of state capitalism (grain monopoly, state-controlled entrepreneurs and traders, bourgeois co-operators) is pierced now in one place, now in another by profiteers, the chief object of profiteering being grain.


It is in this field that the main struggle is being waged. Between what elements is this struggle being waged if we are to speak in terms of economic categories such as âstate capitalismâ? Between the fourth and fifth in the order in which I have just enumerated them? Of course not. It is not state capitalism that is at war with socialism, but the petty bourgeoisie plus private capitalism fighting together against state capitalism and socialism. The petty bourgeoisie oppose every kind of state interference, accounting and control, whether it be state-capitalist or state-socialist. This is an unquestionable fact of reality whose misunderstanding lies at the root of many economic mistakes. The profiteer, the commercial racketeer, the disrupter of monopolyâthese are our principal âinternalâ enemies, the enemies of the economic measures of the Soviet power. A hundred and twenty-five years ago it might have been excusable for the French petty bourgeoisie, the most ardent and sincere revolutionaries, to try to crush the profiteer by executing a few of the âchosenâ and by making thunderous declarations. Today, however, the purely French approach to the question assumed by some Left Socialist-Revolutionaries can arouse nothing but disgust and revulsion in every politically conscious revolutionary. We know perfectly well that the economic basis of profiteering is both the small proprietors, who are exceptionally widespread in Russia, and private capitalism, of which every petty bourgeois is an agent. We know that the million tentacles of this petty-bourgeois octopus now and again encircle various sections of the workers, that instead of state monopoly, profiteering forces its way into every pore of our social and economic organism.


Those who fail to see this show by their blindness that they are slaves of petty-bourgeois prejudices....


The petty bourgeoisie have money put away, the few thousands that they made during the war by âhonestâ and especially by dishonest means. They are the characteristic economic type, that is, the basis of profiteering and private capitalism. Money is a certificate entitling the possessor to receive social wealth; and a vast section of small proprietors, numbering millions, cling to this certificate and conceal it from the âstateâ. They do not believe in socialism or communism, and âmark timeâ until the proletarian storm blows over. Either we subordinate the petty bourgeoisie to our control and accounting (we can do this if we organise the poor, that is, the majority of the population or semi-proletarians, round the politically conscious proletarian vanguard), or they will overthrow our workersâ power as surely and as inevitably as the revolution was overthrown by the Napoleons and the Cavaignacs who sprang from this very soil of petty proprietorship. That is how the question stands. That is the only view we can take of the matter....


The petty bourgeois who hoards his thousands is an enemy of state capitalism. He wants to employ these thousands just for himself, against the poor, in opposition to any kind of state control. And the sum total of these thousands, amounting to many thousands of millions, forms the base for profiteering, which undermines our socialist construction. Let us assume that a certain number of workers produce in a few days values equal to 1,000. Let us then assume that 200 of this total vanishes owing to petty profiteering, various kinds of embezzlement and the evasion by the small proprietors of Soviet decrees and regulations. Every politically conscious worker will say that if better order and organisation could be obtained at the price of 300 out of the 1,000 he would willingly give 300 instead of 200, for it will be quite easy under the Soviet power to reduce this âtributeâ later on to, say, 100 or 50, once order and organisation are established and the petty-bourgeois disruption of state monopoly is completely overcome.


This simple illustration in figures, which I have deliberately simplified to the utmost in order to make it absolutely clear, explains the present correlation of state capitalism and socialism. The workers hold state power and have every legal opportunity of âtakingâ the whole thousand, without giving up a single kopek, except for socialist purposes. This legal opportunity, which rests upon the actual transition of power to the workers, is an element of socialism. But in many ways, the small-proprietary and private-capitalist element undermines this legal position, drags in profiteering and hinders the execution of Soviet decrees. State capitalism would be a gigantic step forward even if we paid more than we are paying at present (I took the numerical example deliberately to bring this out more sharply), because it is worth paying for âtuitionâ, because it is useful for the workers, because victory over disorder, economic ruin and laxity is the most important thing, because the continuation of the anarchy of small ownership is the greatest, the most serious danger, and it will certainly be our ruin (unless we overcome it), whereas not only will the payment of a heavier tribute to state capitalism not ruin us, it will lead us to socialism by the surest road. When the working class has learned how to defend the state system against the anarchy of small ownership, when it has learned to organise large-scale production on a national scale along state-capitalist lines, it will hold, if I may use the expression, all the trump cards, and the consolidation of socialism will be assured.


In the first place economically state capitalism is immeasurably superior to our present economic system.


In the second place there is nothing terrible in it for the Soviet power, for the Soviet state is a state in which the power of the workers and the poor is assured....


To make things even clearer, let us first of all take the most concrete example of state capitalism. Everybody knows what this example is. It is Germany. Here we have âthe last wordâ in modern large-scale capitalist engineering and planned organisation, subordinated to Junker-bourgeois imperialism. Cross out the words in italics, and in place of the militarist, Junker, bourgeois, imperialist state put also a state, but of a different social type, of a different class contentâa Soviet state, that is, a proletarian state, and you will have the sum total of the conditions necessary for socialism.


Socialism is inconceivable without large-scale capitalist engineering based on the latest discoveries of modern science. It is inconceivable without planned state organisation which keeps tens of millions of people to the strictest observance of a unified standard in production and distribution. We Marxists have always spoken of this, and it is not worth while wasting two seconds talking to people who do not understand even this (anarchists and a good half of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries).


At the same time socialism is inconceivable unless the proletariat is the ruler of the state. This also is ABC. And history (which nobody, except Menshevik blockheads of the first order, ever expected to bring about âcompleteâ socialism smoothly, gently, easily and simply) has taken such a peculiar course that it has given birth in 1918 to two unconnected halves of socialism existing side by side like two future chickens in the single shell of international imperialism. In 1918, Germany and Russia had become the most striking embodiment of the material realisation of the economic, the productive and the socio-economic conditions for socialism, on the one hand, and the political conditions, on the other.


A victorious proletarian revolution in Germany would immediately and very easily smash any shell of imperialism (which unfortunately is made of the best steel, and hence cannot be broken by the efforts of any chicken) and would bring about the victory of world socialism for certain, without any difficulty, or with only slight difficultyâif, of course, by âdifficultyâ we mean difficulty on a world historical scale, and not in the parochial philistine sense.


While the revolution in Germany is still slow in âcoming forthâ, our task is to study the state capitalism of the Germans, to spare no effort in copying it and not shrink from adopting dictatorial methods to hasten the copying of Western culture by barbarian Russia, without hesitating to use barbarous methods in fighting barbarism. If there are anarchists and Left Soeialist-Revolutionaries (I recall offhand the speeches of Karelin and Ghe at the meeting of the Central Executive Committee) who indulge in Karelin-like reflections and say that it is unbecoming for us revolutionaries to âtake lessonsâ from German imperialism, there is only one thing we can say in reply: the revolution that took these people seriously would perish irrevocably (and deservedly).


At present petty-bourgeois capitalism prevails in Russia, and it is one and the same road that leads from it to both large-scale state capitalism and to socialism, through one and the same intermediary station called ânational accounting and control of production and distributionâ. Those who fail to understand this are committing an unpardonable mistake in economics. Either they do not know the facts of life, do not see what actually exists and are unable to look the truth in the face, or they confine themselves to abstractly comparing âsocialismâ with âcapitalismâ and fail to study the concrete forms and stages of the transition that is taking place in our country.


Let it be said in parenthesis that this is the very theoretical mistake which misled the best people in the Novaya Zhizn and Vperyod[2] camp. The worst and the mediocre of these, owing to their stupidity and spinelessness, tag along behind the bourgeoisie, of whom they stand in awe; the best of them have failed to understand that it was not without reason that the teachers of socialism spoke of a whole period of transition from capitalism to socialism and emphasised the âprolonged birth pangsâ of the new society.[3] And this new society is again an abstraction which can come into being only by passing through a series of varied, imperfect and concrete attempts to create this or that socialist state.


It is because Russia cannot advance from the economic situation now existing-here without traversing the ground which is common to state capitalism and to socialism (national accounting and control) that the attempt to frighten others as well as themselves with âevolution towards state capitalismâ is utter theoretical nonsense. This is letting oneâs thoughts wander away from the true road of âevolutionâ, and failing to understand what this road is. In practice, it is equivalent to pulling us back to small proprietary capitalism.


In order to convince the reader that this is not the first time I have given this âhighâ appreciation of state capitalism and that I gave it before the Bolsheviks seized power, I take the liberty of quoting the following passage from my pamphlet, The Impending Catastrophe and How To Combat It, written in September 1917.


âTry to substitute for the Junker-capitalist state, for the landowner-capitalist state, a revolutionary-democratic state, i.e., a state which in a revolutionary way abolishes all privileges and does not fear to introduce the fullest democracy in a revolutionary way. You will find that, given a really revolutionary-democratic state, state-monopoly capitalism inevitably and unavoidably implies a step ... towards socialism....


âFor socialism is merely the next step forward from state-capitalist monopoly....


âState-monopoly capitalism is a complete material preparation for socialism, the threshold of socialism, a rung on the ladder of history between which and the rung called socialism there are no intermediate rungsâ (pp. 27 and 28).


Please note that this was written when Kerensky was in power, that we are discussing not the dictatorship of the proletariat, not the socialist state, but the ârevolutionary democraticâ state. Is it not clear that the higher we stand on this political ladder, the more completely we incorporate the socialist state and the dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviets, the less ought we to fear âstate capitalismâ? Is it not clear that from the material, economic and productive point of view, we are not yet on the âthresholdâ of socialism? Is it not clear that we cannot pass through the door of socialism without crossing the âthresholdâ we have not yet reached?...


The following is also extremely instructive.


When we argued with Comrade Bukharin in the Central Executive Committee, he declared, among other things, that on the question of high salaries for specialists âtheyâ were âto the right of Leninâ, for in this case âtheyâ saw no deviation from principle, bearing in mind Marxâs words that under certain conditions it is more expedient for the working class to âbuy out the whole lot of themâ[4] (namely, the whole lot of capitalists, i.e., to buy from the bourgeoisie the land, factories, works and other means of production).


That is a very interesting statement....


Let us consider Marxâs idea carefully.


Marx was talking about the Britain of the seventies of the last century, about the culminating point in the development of pre-monopoly capitalism. At that time Britain was a country in which militarism and bureaucracy were less pronounced than in any other, a country in which there was the greatest possibility of a âpeacefulâ victory for socialism in the sense of the workers âbuying outâ the bourgeoisie. And Marx said that under certain conditions the workers would certainly not refuse to buy out the bourgeoisie. Marx did not commit himself, or the future leaders of the socialist revolution, to matters of form, to ways and means of bringing about the revolution. He understood perfectly well that a vast number of new problems would arise, that the whole situation would change in the course of the revolution, and that the situation would change radically and often in the course of the revolution.


Well, and what about Soviet Russia? Is it not clear that after the seizure of power by the proletariat and after the crushing of the exploitersâ armed resistance and sabotageâcertain conditions prevail which correspond to those which might have existed in Britain half a century ago had a peaceful transition to socialism begun there? The subordination of the capitalists to the workers in Britain would have been assured at that time owing to the following circumstances: (1) the absolute preponderance of workers, of proletarians, in the population owing to the absence of a peasantry (in Britain in the seventies there where signs that gave hope of an extremely rapid spread of socialism among agricultural labourers); (2) the excellent organisation of the proletariat in trade unions (Britain was at that time the leading country in the world in this respect); (3) the comparatively high level of culture of the proletariat, which had been trained by centuries of development of political liberty; (4) the old habit of the well-organised British capitalists of settling political and economic questions by compromiseâat that time the British capitalists were better organised than the capitalists of any country in the world (this superiority has now passed to Germany). These were the circumstances which at the time gave rise to the idea that the peaceful subjugation of the British capitalists by the workers was possible.


In our country, at the present time, this subjugation is assured by certain premises of fundamental significance (the victory in October and the suppression, from October to February, of the capitalistsâ armed resistance and sabotage). But instead of the absolute preponderance of workers, of proletarians, in the population, and instead of a high degree of organisation among them, the important factor of victory in Russia was the support the proletarians received from the poor peasants and those who had experienced sudden ruin. Finally, we have neither a high degree of culture nor the habit of compromise. If these concrete conditions are carefully considered, it will become clear that we now can and ought to employ a combination of two methods. On the one hand, we must ruthlessly suppress the uncultured capitalists who refuse to have anything to do with âstate capitalismâ or to consider any form of compromise, and who continue by means of profiteering, by bribing the poor peasants, etc., to hinder the realisation of the measures taken by the Soviets. On the other hand, we must use the method of compromise, or of buying out the cultured capitalists who agree to âstate capitalismâ, who are capable of putting it into practice and who are useful to the proletariat as intelligent and experienced organisers of the largest types of enterprises, which actually supply products to tens of millions of people.


Bukharin is an extremely well-read Marxist economist. He therefore remembered that Marx was profoundly right when he taught the workers the importance of preserving the organisation of large-scale production, precisely for the purpose of facilitating the transition to socialism. Marx taught that (as an exception, and Britain was then an exception) the idea was conceivable of paying the capitalists well, of buying them out, if the circumstances were such as to compel the capitalists to submit peacefully and to come over to socialism in a cultured and organised fashion, provided they were paid well.


But Bukharin went astray because he did not go deep enough into the specific features of the situation in Russia at the present timeâan exceptional situation when we, the Russian proletariat, are in advance of any Britain or any Germany as regards political system, as regards the strength of the workersâ political power, but are behind the most backward West-European country as regards organising a good state capitalism, as regards our level of culture and the degree of material and productive preparedness for the âintroductionâ of socialism. Is it not clear that the specific nature of the present situation creates the need for a specific type of âbuying outâ operation which the workers must offer to the most cultured, the most talented, the most capable organisers among the capitalists who are ready to enter the service of the Soviet power and to help honestly in organising âstateâ production on the largest possible scale? Is it not clear that in this specific situation we must make every effort to avoid two mistakes, both of which are of a petty-bourgeois nature? On the one hand, it would be a fatal mistake to declare that since there is a discrepancy between our economic âforcesâ and our political strength, it âfollowsâ that we should not have seized power. Such an argument can be advanced only by a âman in a mufflerâ, who forgets that there will always be such a âdiscrepancyâ, that it always exists in the development of nature as well as in the development of society, that only by a series of attemptsâeach of which, taken by itself, will be one-sided and will suffer from certain inconsistenciesâwill complete socialism be created by the revolutionary co-operation of the proletarians of all countries.


On the other hand, it would be an obvious mistake to give free rein to ranters and phrase-mongers who allow themselves to be carried away by the âdazzlingâ revolutionary spirit, but who are incapable of sustained, thoughtful and deliberate revolutionary work which takes into account the most difficult stages of transition.


Fortunately, the history of the development of revolutionary parties and of the struggle that Bolshevism waged against them has left us a heritage of sharply defined types, of which the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and anarchists are striking examples of bad revolutionaries. They are now shouting hysterically, choking and shouting themselves hoarse, against the âcompromiseâ of the âRight Bolsheviksâ. But they are incapable of understanding what is bad in âcompromiseâ, and why âcompromiseâ has been justly condemned by history and the course of the revolution.


Compromise in Kerenskyâs time meant the surrender of power to the imperialist bourgeoisie, and the question of power is the fundamental question of every revolution. Compromise by a section of the Bolsheviks in October November 1917 either meant that they feared the proletariat seizing power or wished to share power equally, not only with âunreliable fellow-travellersâ like the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, but also with enemies, with the Chernovists and the Mensheviks. The latter would inevitably have hindered us in fundamental matters, such as the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the ruthless suppression of the Bogayevskys, the universal setting up of the Soviet institutions, and in every act of confiscation.


Now power has been seized, retained and consolidated in the hands of a single party, the party of the proletariat, even without the âunreliable fellow-travellersâ. To speak of compromise at the present time when there is no question, and can be none, of sharing power, of renouncing the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, is merely to repeat, parrot-fashion, words which have been learned by heart but not understood. To describe as âcompromiseâ the fact that, having arrived at a situation when we can and must rule the country, we try to win over to our side, not grudging the cost, the most efficient people capitalism has trained and to take them into our service against small proprietary disintegration, reveals a total incapacity to think about the economic tasks of socialist construction.


Tax In Kind, Freedom To Trade And Concessions


In the arguments of 1918 quoted above there are a number of mistakes as regards the periods of time involved. These turned out to be longer than was anticipated at that time. That is not surprising. But the basic elements of our economy have remained the same. In a very large number of cases the peasant âpoorâ (proletarians and semi-proletarians) have become middle peasants. This has caused an increase in the small-proprietor, petty-bourgeois âelementâ. The Civil War of 1918-20 aggravated the havoc in the country, retarded the restoration of its productive forces, and bled the proletariat more than any other class. To this was added the 1920 crop failure, the fodder shortage and the loss of cattle, which still further retarded the rehabilitation of transport and industry, because, among other things, it interfered with the employment of peasantsâ horses for carting wood, our main type of fuel.


As a result, the political situation in the spring of 1921 was such that immediate, very resolute and urgent measures had to be taken to improve the condition of the peasants and to increase their productive forces.


Why the peasants and not the workers?


Because you need grain and fuel to improve the condition of the workers. This is the biggest âhitchâ at the present time, from the standpoint of the economy as a whole. For it is impossible to increase the production and collection of grain and the storage and delivery of fuel except by improving the condition of the peasantry, and raising their productive forces. We must start with the peasantry. Those who fail to understand this, and think this putting the peasantry in the forefront is ârenunciationâ of the dictatorship of the proletariat, or something like that, simply do not stop to think, and allow themselves to be swayed by the power of words. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the direction of policy by the proletariat. The proletariat, as the leading and ruling class, must be able to direct policy in such a way as to solve first the most urgent and âvexedâ problem. The most urgent thing at the present time is to take measures that will immediately increase the productive forces of peasant farming. Only in this way will it be possible to improve the condition of the workers, strengthen the alliance between the workers and peasants, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletarian or representative of the proletariat who refused to improve the condition of the workers in this way would in fact prove himself to be an accomplice of the whiteguards and the capitalists; to refuse to do it in this way means putting the craft interests of the workers above their class interests, and sacrificing the interests of the whole of the working class, its dictatorship, its alliance with the peasantry against the landowners and capitalists, and its leading role in the struggle for the emancipation of labour from the yoke of capital, for the sake of an immediate, short-term and partial advantage for the workers.


Thus, the first thing we need is immediate and serious measures to raise the productive forces of the peasantry.


This cannot be done without making important changes in our food policy. One such change was the replacement of the surplus appropriation system by the tax in kind, which implies a free market, at least in local economic exchange, after the tax has been paid.


What is the essence of this change?


Wrong ideas on this point are widespread. They are due mainly to the fact that no attempt is being made to study the meaning of the transition or to determine its implications, it being assumed that the change is from communism in general to the bourgeois system in general. To counteract this mistake, one has to refer to what was said in May 1918.


The tax in kind is one of the forms of transition from that peculiar War Communism, which was forced on us by extreme want, ruin and war, to regular socialist exchange of products. The latter, in its turn, is one of the forms of transition from socialism, with the peculiar features due to the predominantly small-peasant population, to communism.


Under this peculiar War Communism we actually took from the peasant all his surplusesâand sometimes even a part of his necessariesâto meet the requirements of the army and sustain the workers. Most of it we took on loan, for paper money. But for that, we would not have beaten the landowners and capitalists in a ruined small-peasant country. The fact that we did (in spite of the help our exploiters got from the most powerful countries of the world) shows not only the miracles of heroism the workers and peasants can perform in the struggle for their emancipation; it also shows that when the Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Kautsky and Co. blamed us for this War Communism they were acting as lackeys of the bourgeoisie. We deserve credit for it.


Just how much credit is a fact of equal importance. It was the war and the ruin that forced us into War Communism. It was not, and could not be, a policy that corresponded to the economic tasks of the proletariat. It was a makeshift. The correct policy of the proletariat exercising its dictatorship in a small-peasant country is to obtain grain in exchange for the manufactured goods the peasant needs. That is the only kind of food policy that corresponds to the tasks of the proletariat, and can strengthen the foundations of socialism and lead to its complete victory.


The tax in kind is a transition to this policy. We are still so ruined and crushed by the burden of war (which was on but yesterday and could break out anew tomorrow, owing to the rapacity and malice of the capitalists) that we cannot give the peasant manufactured goods in return for all the grain we need. Being aware of this, we are introducing the tax in kind, that is, we shall take the minimum of grain we require (for the army and the workers) in the form of a tax and obtain the rest in exchange for manufactured goods.


There is something else we must not forget. Our poverty and ruin are so great that we cannot restore large-scale socialist state industry at one stroke. This can be done with large stocks of grain and fuel in the big industrial centres, replacement of worn-out machinery, and so on. Experience has convinced us that this cannot be done at one stroke, and we know that after the ruinous imperialist war even the wealthiest and most advanced countries will be able to solve this problem only over a fairly long period of years. Hence, it is necessary, to a certain extent, to help to restore small industry, which does not demand of the state machines, large stocks of raw material, fuel and food, and which can immediately render some assistance to peasant farming and increase its productive forces right away.


What is to be the effect of all this?


It is the revival of the petty bourgeoisie and of capitalism on the basis of some freedom of trade (if only local). That much is certain and it is ridiculous to shut our eyes to it.


Is it necessary? Can it be justified? Is it not dangerous?


Many such questions are being asked, and most are merely evidence of simple-mindedness, to put it mildly.


Look at my May 1918 definition of the clements (constituent parts) of the various socio-economic structures in our economy. No one can deny the existence of all these five stages (or constituent parts), of the five forms of economyâfrom the patriarchal, i.e., semi-barbarian, to the socialist system. That the small-peasant âstructureâ, partly patriarchal, partly petty bourgeois, predominates in a small-peasant country is self-evident. It is an incontrovertible truth, elementary to political economy, which even the laymanâs everyday experience will confirm, that once you have exchange the small economy is bound to develop the petty-bourgeois-capitalist way.


What is the policy the socialist proletariat can pursue in the face of this economic reality? Is it to give the small peasant all he needs of the goods produced by large-scale socialist industries in exchange for his grain and raw materials? This would be the most desirable and âcorrectâ policyâand we have started on it. But we cannot supply all the goods, very far from it; nor shall we be able to do so very soonâat all events not until we complete the first stage of the electrification of the whole country. What is to be done? One way is to try to prohibit entirely, to put the lock on all development of private, non-state exchange, i.e., trade, i.e., capitalism, which is inevitable with millions of small producers. But such a policy would be foolish and suicidal for the party that tried to apply it. It would be foolish because it is economically impossible. It would be suicidal because the party that tried to apply it would meet with inevitable disaster. Let us admit it: some Communists have sinned âin thought, word and deedâ by adopting just such a policy. We shall try to rectify these mistakes, and this must be done without fail, otherwise things will come to a very sorry state.


The alternative (and this is the only sensible and the last possible policy) is not to try to prohibit or put the lock on the development of capitalism, but to channel it into state capitalism. This is economically possible, for state capitalism existsâin varying form and degreeâwherever there are elements of unrestricted trade and capitalism in general.


Can the Soviet state and the dictatorship of the proletariat be combined with state capitalism? Are they compatible?


Of course they are. This is exactly what I argued in May 1918. I hope I had proved it then. I had also proved that state capitalism is a step forward compared with the small proprietor (both small-patriarchal and petty-bourgeois) element. Those who compare state capitalism only with socialism commit a host of mistakes, for in the present political and economic circumstances it is essential to compare state capitalism also with petty-bourgeois production.


The whole problemâin theoretical and practical termsâis to find the correct methods of directing the development of capitalism (which is to some extent and for some time inevitable) into the channels of state capitalism, and to determine how we are to hedge it about with conditions to ensure its transformation into socialism in the near future.


In order to approach the solution of this problem we must first of all picture to ourselves as distinctly as possible what state capitalism will and can be in practice inside the Soviet system and within the framework of the Soviet state.


Concessions are the simplest example of how the Soviet government directs the development of capitalism into the channels of state capitalism and âimplantsâ state capitalism. We all agree now that concessions are necessary, but have we all thought about the implications? What are concessions under the Soviet system, viewed in the light of the above-mentioned forms of economy and their interrelations? They are an agreement, an alliance, a bloc between the Soviet, i.e., proletarian, state power and state capitalism against the small-proprietor (patriarchal and petty-bourgeois) element. The concessionaire is a capitalist. He conducts his business on capitalist lines, for profit, and is willing to enter into an agreement with the proletarian government in order to obtain superprofits or raw materials which he cannot otherwise obtain, or can obtain only with great difficulty. Soviet power gains by the development of the productive forces, and by securing an increased quantity of goods immediately, or within a very short period. We have, say, a hundred oilfields, mines and forest tracts. We cannot develop all of them for we lack the machines, the food and the transport. This is also why we are doing next to nothing to develop the other territories. Owing to the insufficient development of the large enterprises the small-proprietor element is more pronounced in all its forms, and this is reflected in the deterioration of the surrounding (and later the whole of) peasant farming, the disruption of its productive forces, the decline in its confidence in the Soviet power, pilfering and widespread petty (the most dangerous) profiteering, etc. By âimplantingâ state capitalism in the form of concessions, the Soviet government strengthens large-scale production as against petty production, advanced production as against backward production, and machine production as against hand production. It also obtains a larger quantity of the products of large-scale industry (its share of the output), and strengthens state regulated economic relations as against the anarchy of petty-bourgeois relations. The moderate and cautious application of the concessions policy will undoubtedly help us quickly to improve (to a modest extent) the state of industry and the condition of the workers and peasants. We shall, of course, have all this at the price of certain sacrifices and the surrender to the capitalist of many millions of poods of very valuable products. The scale and the conditions under which concessions cease to be a danger and are turned to our advantage depend on the relation of forces and are decided in the struggle, for concessions are also a form of struggle, and are a continuation of the class struggle in another form, and in no circumstances are they a substitution of class peace for class war. Practice will determine the methods of struggle.


Compared with other forms of state capitalism within the Soviet system, concessions are perhaps the most simple and clear-cut form of state capitalism. It involves a formal written agreement with the most civilised, advanced, West European capitalism. We know exactly what our gains and our losses, our rights and obligations are. We know exactly the term for which the concession is granted. We know the terms of redemption before the expiry of the agreement if it provides for such redemption. We pay a certain âtributeâ to world capitalism; we âransomâ ourselves under certain arrangements, thereby immediately stabilising the Soviet power and improving our economic conditions. The whole difficulty with concessions is giving the proper consideration and appraisal of all the circumstances when concluding a concession agreement, and then seeing that it is fulfilled. Difficulties there certainly are, and mistakes will probably be inevitable at the outset. But these are minor difficulties compared with the other problems of the social revolution and, in particular, with the difficulties arising from other forms of developing, permitting and implanting state capitalism.


The most important task that confronts all Party and Soviet workers in connection with the introduction of the tax in kind is to apply the principles of the âconcessionsâ policy (i.e., a policy that is similar to âconcessionâ state capitalism) to the other forms of capitalismâunrestricted trade, local exchange, etc.


Take the co-operatives. It is not surprising that the tax in kind decree immediately necessitated a revision of the regulations governing the co-operatives and a certain extension of their âfreedomâ and rights. The co-operatives are also a form of state capitalism, but a less simple one; its outline is less distinct, it is more intricate and therefore creates greater practical difficulties for the government. The small commodity producersâ co-operatives (and it is these, and not the workersâ co-operatives, that we are discussing as the predominant and typical form in a small-peasant country) inevitably give rise to petty-bourgeois, capitalist relations, facilitate their development, push the small capitalists into the foreground and benefit them most. It cannot be otherwise, since the small proprietors predominate, and exchange is necessary and possible. In Russiaâs present conditions, freedom and rights for the co-operative societies mean freedom and rights for capitalism. It would be stupid or criminal to close our eyes to this obvious truth.


But, unlike private capitalism, âco-operativeâ capitalism under the Soviet system is a variety of state capitalism, and as such it is advantageous and useful for us at the present timeâin certain measure, of course. Since the tax in kind means the free sale of surplus grain (over and above that taken in the form of the tax), we must exert every effort to direct this development of capitalismâfor a free market is development of capitalismâinto the channels of co-operative capitalism. It resembles state capitalism in that it facilitates accounting, control, supervision and the establishment of contractual relations between the state (in this case the Soviet state) and the capitalist. Co-operative trade is more advantageous and useful than private trade not only for the above-mentioned reasons, but also because it facilitates the association and organisation of millions of people, and eventually of the entire population, and this in its turn is an enormous gain from the standpoint of the subsequent transition from state capitalism to socialism.


Let us make a comparison of concessions and co-operatives as forms of state capitalism. Concessions are based on large-scale machine industry; co-operatives are based on small, handicraft, and partly even on patriarchal industry. Each concession agreement affects one capitalist, firm, syndicate, cartel or trust. Co-operative societies embrace many thousands and even millions of small proprietors. Concessions allow and even imply a definite agreement for a specified period. Co-operative societies allow of neither. It is much easier to repeal the law on the co-operatives than to annul a concession agreement, but the annulment of an agreement means a sudden rupture of the practical relations of economic alliance, or economic coexistence, with the capitalist, whereas the repeal of the law on the co-operatives, or any law, for that matter, does not immediately break off the practical coexistence of Soviet power and the small capitalists, nor, in general, is it able to break off the actual economic relations. It is easy to âkeep an eyeâ on a concessionaire but not on the co-operators. The transition from concessions to socialism is a transition from one form of large-scale production to another. The transition from small-proprietor co-operatives to socialism is a transition from small to large-scale production, i.e., it is more complicated, but, if successful, is capable of embracing wider masses of the population, and pulling up the deeper and more tenacious roots of the old, pre-socialist and even pre-capitalist relations, which most stubbornly resist all âinnovationsâ. The concessions policy, if successful, will give us a few modelâcompared with our ownâlarge enterprises built on the level of modern advanced capitalism. After a few decades these enterprises will revert to us in their entirety. The co-operative policy, if successful, will result in raising the small economy and in facilitating its transition, within an indefinite period, to large-scale production on the basis of voluntary association.


Take a third form of state capitalism. The state enlists the capitalist as a merchant and pays him a definite commission on the sale of state goods and on the purchase of the produce of the small producer. A fourth form: the state leases to the capitalist entrepreneur an industrial establishment, oilfields, forest tracts, land, etc., which belong to the state, the lease being very similar to a concession agreement. We make no mention of, we give no thought or notice to, these two latter forms of state capitalism, not because we are strong and clever but because we are weak and foolish. We are afraid to look the âvulgar truthâ squarely in the face, and too often yield to âexalting deceptionââ.[5] We keep repeating that âweâ are passing from capitalism to socialism, but do not bother to obtain a distinct picture of the âweâ. To keep this picture clear we must constantly have in mind the whole listâwithout any exceptionâof the constituent parts of our national economy, of all its diverse forms that I gave in my article of May 5, 1918. âWeâ, the vanguard, the advanced contingent of the proletariat, are passing directly to socialism; but the advanced contingent is only a small part of the whole of the proletariat while the latter, in its turn, is only a small part of the whole population. If âweâ are successfully to solve the problem of our immediate transition to socialism, we must understand what intermediary paths, methods, means and instruments are required for the transition from pre-capitalist relations to socialism. That is the whole point.


Look at the map of the R.S.F.S.R. There is room for dozens of large civilised states in those vast areas which lie to the north of Vologda, the south-east of Rostov-on-Don and Saratov, the south of Orenburg and Omsk, and the north of Tomsk. They are a realm of patriarchalism, and semi- and downright barbarism. And what about the peasant backwoods of the rest of Russia, where scores of versts of country track, or rather of trackless country, lie between the villages and the railways, i.e., the material link with the big cities, large-scale industry, capitalism and culture? Isnât that also an area of wholesale patriarchalism, Oblomovism[6] and semi-barbarism?


Is an immediate transition to socialism from the state of affairs predominating in Russia conceivable? Yes, it is, to a certain degree, but on one condition, the precise nature of which we now know thanks to a great piece of scientific work[7] that has been completed. It is electrification. If we construct scores of district electric power stations (we now know where and how these can and should be constructed), and transmit electric power to every village, if we obtain a sufficient number of electric motors and other machinery, we shall not need, or shall hardly need, any transition stages or intermediary links between patriarchalism and socialism. But we know perfectly well that it will take at least ten years only to complete the first stage of this âoneâ condition; this period can be conceivably reduced only if the proletarian revolution is victorious in such countries as Britain, Germany or the U.S.A.


Over the next few years we must learn to think of the intermediary links that can facilitate the transition from patriarchalism and small production to socialism. âWeâ continue saying now and again that âcapitalism is a bane and socialism is a boonâ. But such an argument is wrong, because it fails to take into account the aggregate of the existing economic forms and singles out only two of them.


Capitalism is a bane compared with socialism. Capitalism is a boon compared with medievalism, small production, and the evils of bureaucracy which spring from the dispersal of the small producers. Inasmuch as we are as yet unable to pass directly from small production to socialism, some capitalism is inevitable as the elemental product of small production and exchange; so that we must utilise capitalism (particularly by directing it into the channels of state capitalism) as the intermediary link between small production and socialism, as a means, a path, and a method of increasing the productive forces.


Look at the economic aspect of the evils of bureaucracy. We see nothing of them on May 5, 1918. Six months after the October Revolution, with the old bureaucratic apparatus smashed from top to bottom, we feel none of its evils.


A year later, the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (March 18-23, 1919)[8] adopted a new Party Programme in which we spoke forthrightly of âa partial revival of bureaucracy within the Soviet systemâânot fearing to admit the evil, but desiring to reveal, expose and pillory it and to stimulate thought, will, energy and action to combat it.


Two years later, in the spring of 1921, after the Eighth Congress of Soviets (December 1920), which discussed the evils of bureaucracy, and after the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (March 1921), which summed up the controversies closely connected with an analysis of these evils, we find them even more distinct and sinister. What are their economic roots? They are mostly of a dual character: on the one hand, a developed bourgeoisie needs a bureaucratic apparatus, primarily a military apparatus, and then a judiciary, etc., to use against the revolutionary movement of the workers (and partly of the peasants). That is something we have not got. Ours are class courts directed against the bourgeoisie. Ours is a class army directed against the bourgeoisie. The evils of bureaucracy are not in the army, but in the institutions serving it. In our country bureaucratic practices have different economic roots, namely, the atomised and scattered state of the small producer with his poverty, illiteracy, lack of culture, the absence of roads and exchange between agriculture and industry, the absence of connection and interaction between them. This is largely the result of the Civil War. We could not restore industry when we were blockaded, besieged on all sides, cut off from the whole world and later from the grain-bearing South, Siberia, and the coalfields. We could not afford to hesitate in introducing War Communism, or daring to go to the most desperate extremes: to save the workersâ and peasantsâ rule we had to suffer an existence of semi-starvation and worse than semi-starvation, but to hold on at all costs, in spite of unprecedented ruin and the absence of economic intercourse. We did not allow ourselves to be frightened, as the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks did (who, in fact, followed the bourgeoisie largely because they were scared). But the factor that was crucial to victory in a blockaded countryâa besieged fortressârevealed its negative side by the spring of 1921, just when the last of the whiteguard forces were finally driven from the territory of the R.S.F.S.R. In the besieged fortress, it was possible and imperative to âlock upâ all exchange; with the masses displaying extraordinary heroism this could be borne for three years. After that, the ruin of the small producer increased, and the restoration of large-scale in dustry was further delayed, and postponed. Bureaucratic practices, as a legacy of the âsiegeâ and the superstructure built over the isolated and downtrodden state of the small producer, fully revealed themselves.


We must learn to admit an evil fearlessly in order to combat it the more firmly, in order to start from scratch again and again; we shall have to do this many a time in every sphere of our activity, finish what was left undone and choose different approaches to the problem. In view of the obvious delay in the restoration of large-scale industry, the âlocking upâ of exchange between industry and agriculture has become intolerable. Consequently, we must concentrate on what we can do: restoring small industry, helping things from that end, propping up the side of the structure that has been half-demolished by the war and blockade. We must do everything possible to develop trade at all costs, without being afraid of capitalism, because the limits we have put to it (the expropriation of the landowners and of the bourgeoisie in the economy, the rule of the workers and peasants in politics) are sufficiently narrow and âmoderateâ. This is the fundamental idea and economic significance of the tax in kind.


All Party and Soviet workers must concentrate their efforts and attention on generating the utmost local initiative in economic developmentâin the gubernias, still more in the uyezds, still more in the volosts and villagesâfor the special purpose of immediately improving peasant farming, even if by âsmallâ means, on a small scale, helping it by developing small local industry. The integrated state economic plan demands that this should become the focus of concern and âpriorityâ effort. Some improvement here, closest to the broadest and deepest âfoundationâ, will permit of the speediest transition to a more vigorous and successful restoration of large-scale industry.


Hitherto the food supply worker has known only one fundamental instruction: collect 100 per cent of the grain appropriations. Now he has another instruction: collect 100 per cent of the tax in the shortest possible time and then collect another 100 per cent in exchange for the goods of large-scale and small industry. Those who collect 75 per cent of the tax and 75 per cent (of the second hundred) in exchange for the goods of large scale and small industry will be doing more useful work of national importance than those who collect 100 per cent of the tax and 55 per cent (of the second hundred) by means of exchange. The task of the food supply worker now becomes more complicated. On the one hand, it is a fiscal task: collect the tax as quickly and as efficiently as possible. On the other hand, it is a general economic task: try to direct the co-operatives, assist small industry, develop local initiative in such a way as to increase the exchange between agriculture and industry and put it on a sound basis. Our bureaucratic practices prove that we are still doing a very bad job of it. We must not be afraid to admit that in this respect we still have a great deal to learn from the capitalist. We shall compare the practical experience of the various gubernias, uyezds, volosts and villages: in one place private capitalists, big and small, have achieved so much; those are their approximate profits. That is the tribute, the fee, we have to pay for the âschoolingâ. We shall not mind paying for it if we learn a thing or two. That much has been achieved in a neighbouring locality through co-operation. Those are the profits of the co-operatives. And in a third place, that much has been achieved by purely state and communist methods (for the present, this third case will be a rare exception).


It should be the primary task of every regional economic centre and economic conference of the gubernia executive committees immediately to organise various experiments, or systems of âexchangeâ for the surplus stocks remaining after the tax in kind has been paid. In a few monthsâ time practical results must be obtained for comparison and study. Local or imported salt; paraffin oil from the nearest town; the handicraft wood-working industry; handicrafts using local raw materials and producing certain, perhaps not very important, but necessary and useful, articles for the peasants; âgreen coalâ (the utilisation of small local water power resources for electrification), and so on and so forthâall this must be brought into play in order to stimulate exchange between industry and agriculture at all costs. Those who achieve the best results in this sphere, even by means of private capitalism, even without the co-operatives, or without directly transforming this capitalism into state capitalism, will do more for the cause of socialist construction in Russia than those who âponder overâ the purity of communism, draw up regulations, rules and instructions for state capitalism and the co-operatives, but do nothing practical to stimulate trade.


Isnât it paradoxical that private capital should be helping socialism?


Not at all. It is, indeed, an irrefutable economic fact. Since this is a small-peasant country with transport in an extreme state of dislocation, a country emerging from war and blockade under the political guidance of the proletariatâwhich controls the transport system and large-scale industryâit inevitably follows, first, that at the present moment local exchange acquires first-class significance, and, second, that there is a possibility of assisting socialism by means of private capitalism (not to speak of state capitalism).


Letâs not quibble about words. We still have too much of that sort of thing. We must have more variety in practical experience and make a wider study of it. In certain circumstances, the exemplary organisation of local work, even on the smallest scale, is of far greater national importance than many branches of central state work. These are precisely the circumstances now prevailing in peasant farming in general, and in regard to the exchange of the surplus products of agriculture for industrial goods in particular. Exemplary organisation in this respect, even in a single volost, is of far greater national importance than the âexemplaryâ improvement of the central apparatus of any People Commissariat; over the past three and a half years our central apparatus has been built up to such an extent that it has managed to acquire a certain amount of harmful routine; we cannot improve it quickly to any extent, we do not know how to do it. Assistance in the work of radically improving it, securing an influx of fresh forces, combating bureaucratic practices effectively and overcoming this harmful routine must come from the localities and the lower ranks, with the model organisation of a âcomplexâ, even if on a small scale. I say âcomplexâ, meaning not just one farm, one branch of industry, or one factory, but a totality of economic relations, a totality of economic exchange, even if only in a small locality.


Those of us who are doomed to remain at work in the centre will continue the task of improving the apparatus and purging it of bureaucratic evils, even if only on a modest and immediately achievable scale. But the greatest assistance in this task is coming, and will come, from the localities. Generally speaking, as far as I can observe, things are better in the localities than at the centre; and this is understandable, for, naturally, the evils of bureaucracy are concentrated at the centre. In this respect, Moscow cannot but be the worst city, and in general the worst âlocalityâ, in the Republic. In the localities we have deviations from the average to the good and the bad sides, the latter being less frequent than the former. The deviations towards the bad side are the abuses committed by former government officials, landowners, bourgeois and other scum who play up to the Communists and who sometimes commit abominable outrages and acts of tyranny against the peasantry. This calls for a terrorist purge, summary trial and the firing squad. Let the Martovs, the Chernovs, and non-Party philistines like them, beat their breasts and exclaim: âI thank Thee, Lord, that I am not as âtheseâ, and have never accepted terrorism.â These simpletons âdo not accept terrorismâ because they choose to be servile accomplices of the whiteguards in fooling the workers and peasants. The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks âdo not accept terrorismâ because under the flag of âsocialismâ they are fulfilling their function of placing the masses at the mercy of the whiteguard terrorism. This was proved by the Kerensky regime and the Kornilov putsch in Russia, by the Kolchak regime in Siberia, and by Menshevism in Georgia. It was proved by the heroes of the Second International and of the âTwo-and-a-Halfâ[9] International in Finland, Hungary, Austria, Germany, Italy, Britain, etc. Let the flunkey accomplices of whiteguard terrorism wallow in their repudiation of all terrorism. We shall speak the bitter and indubitable truth: in countries beset by an unprecedented crisis, the collapse of old ties, and the intensification of the class struggle after the imperialist war of 1914-18âand that means all the countries of the worldâterrorism cannot be dispensed with, notwithstanding the hypocrites and phrase-mongers. Either the whiteguard, bourgeois terrorism of the American, British (Ireland), Italian (the fascists), German, Hungarian and other types, or Red, proletarian terrorism. There is no middle course, no âthirdâ course, nor can there be any.


The deviations towards the good side are the success achieved in combating the evils of bureaucracy, the great attention shown for the needs of the workers and peasants, and the great care in developing the economy, raising the productivity of labour and stimulating local exchange between agriculture and industry. Although the good examples are more numerous than the bad ones, they are, nevertheless, rare. Still, they are there. Young, fresh communist forces, steeled by civil war and privation, are coming forward in all localities. We are still doing far too little to promote these forces regularly from lower to higher posts. This can and must be done more persistently, and on a wider scale than at present. Some workers can and should be transferred from work at the centre to local work. As leading men of uyezds, and of volosts, where they can organise economic work as a whole on exemplary lines, they will do far more good, and perform work of far greater national importance, than by performing some junction at the centre. The exemplary organisation of the work will help to train new workers and provide examples that other districts could follow with relative ease. We at the centre shall be able to do a great deal to encourage the other districts all over the country to âfollowâ the good examples, and even make it mandatory for them to do so.


By its very nature, the work of developing âexchangeâ between agriculture and industry, the exchange of after-tax surpluses for the output of small, mainly handicraft, industry, calls for independent, competent and intelligent local initiative. That is why it is now extremely important from the national standpoint to organise the work in the uyezds and volosts on exemplary lines. In military affairs, during the last Polish war, for example, we were not afraid of departing from the bureaucratic hierarchy, âdowngradingâ, or transferring members of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic to lower posts (while allowing them to retain their higher rank at the centre). Why not now transfer several members of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, or members of collegiums, or other high-ranking comrades, to uyezds or even volosts work? Surely, we have not become so âbureaucratisedâ as to âbe ashamedâ of that. And we shall find scores of workers in the central bodies who will be glad to accept. The economic development of the whole Republic will gain enormously; and the exemplary volosts, or uyezds, will play not only a great, but a positively crucial and historic role.


Incidentely, we should note as a small but significant circumstance the necessary change in our attitude to the problem of combating profiteering. We must foster âproperâ trade, which is one that does not evade state control; it is to our advantage to develop it. But profiteering, in its politico-economic sense, cannot be distinguished from âproperâ trade. Freedom of trade is capitalism; capitalism is profiteering. It would be ridiculous to ignore this.


What then should be done? Shall we declare profiteering to be no longer punishable?


No. We must revise and redraft all the laws on profiteering, and declare all pilfering and every direct or indirect, open or concealed evasion of state control, supervision and accounting to be a punishable offence (and in fact prosecuted with redoubled severity). It is by presenting the question in this way (the Council of Peopleâs Commissars has already started, that is to say, it has ordered that work be started, on the revision of the anti-profiteering laws) that we shall succeed in directing the rather inevitable but necessary development of capitalism into the channels of state capitalism.


Political Summary And Deductions


I still have to deal, if briefly, with the political situation, and the way it has taken shape and changed in connection with the economic developments outlined above.


I have already said that the fundamental features of our economy in 1921 are the same as those in 1918. The spring of 1921, mainly as a result of the crop failure and the loss of cattle, brought a sharp deterioration in the condition of the peasantry, which was bad enough because of the war and blockade. This resulted in political vacillations which, generally speaking, express the very ânatureâ of the small producer. Their most striking expression was the Kronstadt mutiny.


The vacillation of the petty-bourgeois element was the most characteristic feature of the Kronstadt events. There was very little that was clear, definite and fully shaped. We heard nebulous slogans about âfreedomâ, âfreedom of tradeâ, âemancipationâ, âSoviets without the Bolsheviksâ, or new elections to the Soviets, or relief from âParty dictatorshipâ, and so on and so forth. Both the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries declared the Kronstadt movement to be âtheir ownâ. Victor Chernov sent a messenger to Kronstadt. On the latterâs proposal, the Menshevik Valk, one of the Kronstadt leaders, voted for the Constituent Assembly. In a flash, with lightning speed, you might say, the whiteguards mobilised all their forces âfor Kronstadtâ. Their military experts in Kronstadt, a number of experts, and not Kozlovsky alone, drew up a plan for a landing at Oranienbaum, which scared the vacillating mass of Mensheviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and non-party elements. More than fifty Russian whiteguard newspapers published abroad conducted a rabid campaign âfor Kronstadtâ. The big banks, all the forces of finance capital, collected funds to assist Kronstadt. That shrewd leader of the bourgeoisie and the landowners, the Cadet Milyukov, patiently explained to the simpleton Victor Chernov directly (and to the Mensheviks Dan and Rozhkov, who are in jail in Petrograd for their connection with the Kronstadt events, indirectly) that that there is no need to hurry with the Constituent Assembly, and that Soviet power can and must be supportedâonly without the Bolsheviks.


Of course, it is easy to be cleverer than conceited simpletons like Chernov, the petty-bourgeois phrase-monger, or like Martov, the knight of philistine reformism doctored to pass for Marxism. Properly speaking, the point is not that Milyukov, as an individual, has more brains, but that, because of his class position, the party leader of the big bourgeoisie sees and understands the class essence and political interaction of things more clearly than the leaders of the petty bourgeoisie, the Chernovs and Martovs. For the bourgeoisie is really a class force which, under capitalism, inevitably rules both under a monarchy and in the most democratic republic, and which also inevitably enjoys the support of the world bourgeoisie. But the petty bourgeoisie, i.e., all the heroes of the Second International and of the âTwo-and-a-Halfâ International, cannot, by the very economic nature of things, be anything else than the expression of class impotence; hence the vacillation, phrase-mongering and helplessness. In 1789, the petty bourgeois could still be great revolutionaries. In 1848, they were ridiculous and pathetic. Their actual role in 1917-21 is that of abominable agents and out-and-out servitors of reaction, be their names Chernov, Martov, Kautsky, MacDonald, or what have you.


Martov showed himself to be nothing but a philistine Narcissus when he declared in his Berlin journal[10] that Kronstadt not only adopted Menshevik slogans but also proved that there could be an anti-Bolshevik movement which did not entirely serve the interests of the whiteguards, the capitalists and the landowners. He says in effect: âLet us shut our eyes to the fact that all the genuine whiteguards hailed the Kronstadt mutineers and collected funds in aid of Kronstadt through the banks!â Compared with the Chernovs and Martovs, Milyukov is right, for he is revealing the true tactics of the real whiteguard force, the force of the capitalists and landowners. He declares: âIt does not matter whom we support, be they anarchists or any sort of Soviet government, as long as the Bolsheviks are overthrown, as long as there is a shift in power; it does not matter whether to the right or to the left, to the Mensheviks or to the anarchists, as long as it is away from the Bolsheviks. As for the restââweâ, the Milyukovs, âweâ, the capitalists and landowners, will do the rest âourselvesâ; we shall slap down the anarchist pygmies, the Chernovs and the Martovs, as we did Chernov and Maisky in Siberia, the Hungarian Chernovs and Martovs in Hungary, Kautsky in Germany and the Friedrich Adlers and Co. in Vienna.â The real, hard-headed bourgeoisie have made fools of hundreds of these philistine Narcissusesâwhether Menshevik, Socialist-Revolutionary or non-partyâand have driven them out scores of times in all revolutions in all countries. History proves it. The facts bear it out. The Narcissuses will talk; the Milyukovs and whiteguards will act.


Milyukov is absolutely right when he says, âIf only there is a power shift away from the Bolsheviks, no matter whether it is a little to the right or to the left, the rest will take care of itself.â This is class truth, confirmed by the history of revolutions in all countries, and by the centuries of modern history since the Middle Ages. The scattered small producers, the peasants, are economically and politically united either by the bourgeoisie (this has always beenâand will always beâthe case under capitalism in all countries, in all modern revolutions), or by the proletariat (that was the case in a rudimentary form for a very short period at the peak of some of the greatest revolutions in modern history; that has been the case in Russia in a more developed form in 1917-21). Only the Narcissuses will talk and dream about a âthirdâ path, and a âthird forceâ.


With enormous difficulty, and in the course of desperate struggles, the Bolsheviks have trained a proletarian vanguard that is capable of governing; they have created and successfully defended the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the test of four years of practical experience, the relation of class forces in Russia has become as clear as day: the steeled and tempered vanguard of the only revolutionary class; the vacillating petty-bourgeois element; and the Milyukovs, the capitalists and landowners, lying in wait abroad and supported by the world bourgeoisie. It is crystal-clear: only the latter are able to take advantage of any âshift of powerâ, and will certainly do so.


In the 1918 pamphlet I quoted above, this point was put very clearly: âthe principal enemyâ is the âpetty-bourgeois elementâ. âEither we subordinate it to our control and accounting, or it will overthrow the workersâ power as surely and as inevitably as the revolution was overthrown by the Napoleons and the Cavaignacs who sprang from this very soil of petty proprietorship. This is how the question stands. That is the only view we can take of the matter.â (Excerpt from the pamphlet of May 5, 1918, cf. above.)


Our strength lies in complete clarity and the sober consideration of all the existing class magnitudes, both Russian and international; and in the inexhaustible energy, iron resolve and devotion in struggle that arise from this. We have many enemies, but they are disunited, or do not know their own minds (like all the petty bourgeoisie, all the Martovs and Chernovs, all the non-party elements and anarchists). But we are unitedâdirectly among ourselves and indirectly with the proletarians of all countries; we know just what we want. That is why we are invincible on a world scale, although this does not in the least preclude the possibility of defeat for individual proletarian revolutions for longer or shorter periods.


There is good reason for calling the petty-bourgeois element an element, for it is indeed something that is most amorphous, indefinite and unconscious. The petty-bourgeois Narcissuses imagine that âuniversal suffrageâ abolishes the nature of the small producer under capitalism. As a matter of fact, it helps the bourgeoisie, through the church, the press, the teachers, the police, the militarists and a thousand and one forms of economic oppression, to subordinate the scattered small producers. Ruin, want and the hard conditions of life give rise to vacillation: one day for the bourgeoisie, the next, for the proletariat. Only the steeled proletarian vanguard is capable of withstanding and overcoming this vacillation.


The events of the spring of 1921 once again revealed the role of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks: they help the vacillating petty-bourgeois element to recoil from the Bolsheviks, to cause a âshift of powerâ in favour of the capitalists and landowners. The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have now learned to don the ânon-partyâ disguise. This has been fully proved. Only fools now fail to see this and understand that we must not allow ourselves to be fooled. Non-Party conferences are not a fetish. They are valuable if they help us to come closer to the impassive massesâthe millions of working people still outside politics. They are harmful if they provide a platform for the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries masquerading as ânon-partyâ men. They are helping the mutinies, and the whiteguards. The place for Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, avowed or in non-party guise, is not at a non-Party conference but in prison (or on foreign journals, side by side with the whiteguards; we were glad to let Martov go abroad). We can and must find other methods of testing the mood of the masses and coming closer to them. We suggest that those who want to play the parliamentary, constituent assembly and non-Party conference game, should go abroad; over there, by Martovâs side, they can try the charms of âdemocracyâ and ask Wrangelâs soldiers about them. We have no time for this âoppositionâ at âconferencesâ game. We are surrounded by the world bourgeoisie, who are watching for every sign of vacillation in order to bring back âtheir own menâ, and restore the landowners and the bourgeoisie. We will keep in prison the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, whether avowed or in ânon-partyâ guise.


We shall employ every means to establish closer contacts with the masses of working people untouched by politicsâexcept such means as give scope to the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the vacillations that benefit Milyukov. In particular, we shall zealously draw into Soviet work, primarily economic work, hundreds upon hundreds of non-Party people, real non-Party people from the masses, the rank and file of workers and peasants, and not those who have adopted non-party colours in order to crib Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary instructions which are so much to Milyukovâs advantage. Hundreds and thousands of non-Party people are working for us, and scores occupy very important and responsible posts. We must pay more attention to the way they work. We must do more to promote and test thousands and thousands of rank-and-file workers, to try them out systematically and persistently, and appoint hundreds of them to higher posts, if experience shows that they can fill them.


Our Communists still do not have a sufficient understanding of their real duties of administration: they should not strive to do âeverything themselvesâ, running themselves down and failing to cope with everything, undertaking twenty jobs and finishing none. They should check up on the work of scores and hundreds of assistants, arrange to have their work checked up from below, i.e., by the real masses. They should direct the work and learn from those who have the knowledge (the specialists) and the experience in organising large-scale production (the capitalists). The intelligent Communist will not be afraid to learn from the military expert, although nine-tenths of the military experts are capable of treachery at every opportunity. The wise Communist will not be afraid to learn from a capitalist (whether a big capitalist concessionaire, a commission agent, or a petty capitalist co-operator, etc.), although the capitalist is no better than the military expert. Did we not learn to catch treacherous military experts in the Red Army, to bring out the honest and conscientious, and, on the whole, to utilise thousands and tens of thousands of military experts? We are learning to do the same thing (in an unconventional way) with engineers and teachers, although we are not doing it as well as we did it in the Red Army (there Denikin and Kolchak spurred us on, compelled us to learn more quickly, diligently and intelligently). We shall also learn to do it (again in an unconventional way) with the commission agents, with the buyers working for the state, the petty capitalist co-operators, the entrepreneur concessionaires, etc.


The condition of the masses of workers and peasants needs to be improved right away. And we shall achieve this by putting new forces, including non-Party forces, to useful work. The tax in kind, and a number of measures connected with it, will facilitate this; we shall thereby cut at the economic root of the small producerâs inevitable vacillations. And we shall ruthlessly fight the political vacillations, which benefit no one but Milyukov. The waverers are many, we are few. The waverers are disunited, we are united. The waverers are not economically independent, the proletariat is. The waverers donât know their own minds: they want to do something very badly, but Milyukov wonât let them. We know what we want.


And that is why we shall win.


Conclusion


To sum up.


The tax in kind is a transition from War Communism to a regular socialist exchange of products.


The extreme ruin rendered more acute by the crop failure in 1920 has made this transition urgently necessary owing to the fact that it was impossible to restore large-scale industry rapidly.


Hence, the first thing to do is to improve the condition of the peasants. The means are the tax in kind, the development of exchange between agriculture and industry, and the development of small industry.


Exchange is freedom of trade; it is capitalism. It is useful to us inasmuch as it will help us overcome the dispersal of the small producer, and to a certain degree combat the evils of bureaucracy; to what extent this can be done will be determined by practical experience. The proletarian power is in no danger, as long as the proletariat firmly holds power in its hands, and has full control of transport and large-scale industry.


The fight against profiteering must be transformed into a fight against stealing and the evasion of state supervision, accounting and control. By means of this control we shall direct the capitalism that is to a certain extent inevitable and necessary for us into the channels of state capitalism.


The development of local initiative and independent action in encouraging exchange between agriculture and industry must be given the fullest scope at all costs. The practical experience gained must be studied; and this experience must be made as varied as possible.


We must give assistance to small industry servicing peasant farming and helping to improve it. To some extent, this assistance may be given in the form of raw materials from the state stocks. It would be most criminal to leave these raw materials unprocessed.


We must not be afraid of Communists âlearningâ from bourgeois experts, including merchants, petty capitalist co-operators and capitalists, in the same way as we learned from the military experts, though in a different form. The results of the âlearningâ must be tested only by practical experience and by doing things better than the bourgeois experts at your side; try in every way to secure an improvement in agriculture and industry, and to develop exchange between them. Do not grudge them the âtuitionâ fee: none will be too high, provided we learn something. 


Do everything to help the masses of working people, to come closer to them, and to promote from their ranks hundreds and thousands of non-Party people for the work of economic administration. As for the ânon-partyâ people who are only Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries disguised in fashionable non-party attire Ã  la Kronstadt, they should be kept safe in prison, or packed off to Berlin, to join Martov in freely enjoying all the charms of pure democracy and freely exchanging ideas with Chernov, Milyukov and the Georgian Mensheviks.

Endnotes

[1] Lenin began to work on The Tax in Kind pamphlet at the end of March 1921, just after the Tenth Party Congress, and finished it on April 21. He attached great importance to its earliest publication and distribution, because it explained the necessity of transition to the New Economic Policy. In early May, it was published as a pamphlet, and was soon after carried by the magazine Krasnaya Nov No. 1; it later appeared in pamphlet form in many towns, and was reprinted in part and in full in central and local papers. In 1921, it was translated into German, English and French.


A special resolution of the Central Committee instructed all regional, gubernia and uyezd Party committees to use the pamphlet to explain the New Economic Policy to the working people.


[2] Novaya Zhizn (New Life)âa daily published in Petrograd from April 18 (May 1), 1917, to July 1918 by a group of Menshevik internationalists and the writers who contributed to the magazine Letopis (Chronicle).


Lenin said their prevailing mood was one of intellectual scepticism, which is an expression of and a cover up for lack of principle.


The newspaper was hostile to the October Revolution and the Soviet power. From June 1, 1918, it appeared simultaneously in Moscow and Petrograd but both editions were closed down in July 1918. 


(Forward)âa daily published in Moscow from March 1917, first by the Moscow Menshevik organisation and then as the organ of the Moscow and Central Region Committees of the R.S.D.L.P. (Mensheviks), and from April 2, 1918, as the organ of the Central Committce of the Mensheviks. L. Martov, F. I. Dan and A. S. Martynov were among its editors. On May 10, 1918 it was closed down by the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission (Cheka) for counter-revolutionary activity and its editors were committed for trial. On May 14, the paper resumed publication under the name Vsegda Vperyod! (Always Forward!) and was finally closed down in February 1919 under an All-Russia C.E.C. decision.

[4] See Engels, The Peasant Question In France and Germany (Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol. II, Moscow, 1962, p. 438).


[5] A paraphrase of Pushkinâs words from his poem A Hero, in which he says that he prefers the stimulating falsehood to a mass of sordid truths


[6] Oblomovâa Russian landowner from I. A. Goncharovâs eponymous novel, personifying sluggishness, stagnation and inertia.


[7] The reference is to the Plan for the Electrification of Russia worked out by a State Commission which consisted of the best scientists and specialists. It was the first long-range integrated state plan for laying the material foundation of socialism through electrification. The plan was published as a pamphlet for the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets and was approved by it.


[8] The Eighth Party Congress, held in Moscow from March 18 to 23, 1919, was attended by 301 delegates with voice and vote, and 102 with voice only. They represented 313,766 Party members.


The items on the agenda were: 1) Report of the Central Committee, 2) Programme of the R.C.P.(B.); 3) Formation of the Communist International; 4) The military situation and military policy; 5) Work in the countryside; 6) Organisational questions; 7) Election to the Central Committee.


Lenin delivered the opening and closing speeches at the Congress, gave the report of the Central Committee, and the reports on the Party Programme, work in the countryside, and military policy.


The key problem before the Congress was the new Party Programme, worked out under Leninâs guidance and with his participation. The Congress approved Leninâs draft Programme, and rejected Bukharinâs anti-Bolshevik proposals.


The Congress also supported Leninâs programme on the nationalities question and rejected Pyatakovâs and Bukharinâs proposals to exclude from the Programme the paragraph on the right of nations to self-determination.


After Leninâs summing-up speech on the Party Programme, the Congress decided to âadopt the draft Programme as a wholeâ and refer it to a programme commission for final editing. The latter asked Lenin to write âThe draft Third Paragraph of the Political Section of the Programme (For the Programme Commission of the Eighth Party Congress)â, which it later adopted. On March 22, the Congress approved the final text of the Programme.


Another key problem was the attitude to the middle peasants. In his speeches, specifically in his report on work in the countryside, Lenin substantiated the Partyâs new policy: transition from the policy of neutralisation to solid alliance between the working class and the middle peasantry, based on support from the poor peasants and struggle against the kulaks, with the proletariat retaining its leadership of the alliance. Lenin first put forward the slogan in late November 1918. The Congress adopted Leninâs âResolution on the Attitude Towards the Middle Peasantryâ.


While discussing the military situation, the Partyâs military policy and Red Army organisation, the so-called Military Opposition came out against the Central Committeeâs theses (the Opposition included former âLeft CommunistsââV. M. Smirnov, G. I. Safarov, and G. L. Pyatakovâand some independents. It was also supported during the height of the Civil War, by Stalin). The Military Opposition favoured retention of some guerrilla methods, and opposed strict discipline in the army and enlistment of the services of old military specialists. Trotsky, together with Lenin, successfully isolated the Military Opposition and prevented it from damaging the war effort. At a closed plenary session on March 21, Lenin (Trotsky, and others) spoke in defence of the C.C. theses, and was supported by most of the speakers, who denounced the Military Opposition.


The C.C. theses were assumed as a basis by a majority of 174 against 95, and a co-ordination commission worked out a resolution on the military question based on Leninâs directives, which was adopted by the Congress (with only one abstention).


Leninâs ideas on the military question were incorporated in the Party Programme and served as guidance in military organisation. Trotsky, who entrusted in organising the Red Army, from 1918 onward, was Leninâs closest ally on all military and political questions as to how to fight the counter-revolution.


The resolution on the organisational question denounced the Sapronov-Osinsky group, which denied the Partyâs leadership within the system of the dictatorship of the proletariat.


The decision on Party organisation stressed the need to raise the standards for admission of non-worker and non-peasant elements into the Party, to maintain its social composition. It was decided to carry out a general registration of all Party members by May 1, 1919. The Congress rejected the federal principle of Party organisation and approved the principle of an integrated centralised Communist Party working under the guidance of a single Central Committee.


The newly elected Central Committee was headed by Lenin. The Congress welcomed the establishment of the Third (Communist) International and adopted its platform.


[9] An international association of Centrist parties and groups (temporarily made to leave the Second International by revolutionary-minded workersâ masses) called the âTwo-and-a-Half Internationalâ. It was set up in Vienna in 1921 and broke up in 1923, when it rejoined the Second International.


[10] The Menshevik Ã©migrÃ© journal, Sotsialistichesky Vestnik (Socialist Herald), was founded by L. Martov. It was published in Berlin from 1921, and later in Paris. It is now published in the United States.


The delegates sent their greetings to Lenin and invited him to the meeting. Leninâs reply was read out at the final sitting on April 20, 1921.

1. Speech In Opening The Conference May 26
Comrades, permit me to declare the All-Russia Conference of
    the R.C.P. open.
You are aware, comrades, that this conference has been convened earlier
    than is prescribed by the Rules. Consequently, it is not an ordinary, or at
    least, not quite an ordinary conference. You are also aware that the main
    item on the agenda—the main question—that has compelled us to
    convene the conference before the planned date is that of economic
    policy—the tax in kind. It is central at the present time.
I propose that we proceed to elect the presidium of the conference.
2. Report On The Tax In Kind May 26
Comrades, I had occasion to discuss, for the benefit of the
    Party, the question of the tax in kind in a pamphlet with which, I suppose,
    the majority of you are familiar. That this question has been brought up
    for discussion at a Party conference came as a surprise to me, for I had
    not seen anything to indicate that this was called for. But very many of
    the comrades who have visited the localities, notably Comrade Osinsky upon
    his return from a tour of a number of gubernias, informed the
    Central Committee—and this was corroborated by several other
    comrades—that locally the policy which had taken shape in connection
    with the tax in kind remained largely unexplained and partly even
    misunderstood. In view of its exceptional importance, additional discussion
    at a Party conference seemed so necessary that it was decided to convene
    the conference earlier than scheduled. You are aware that we in the Central
    Committee have decided to divide the report on this point into four parts,
    to be given by four rapporteurs : Kamenev, on the work of the
    co-operatives; Milyutin, on small-scale industry; Comrade Svidersky, on the
    precise calculations and proposals of the People’s Commissariat for
    Food, and the related organisational measures; the instructions and
    regulations on the tax system, partly approved, and partly to be approved
    shortly, by the Council of People’s Commissars, are of especial
    importance in this connection. Finally, Comrade Khinchuk is to be the
    fourth rapporteur ; he has been relieved of all his duties in the
    People’s Commissariat for Food to allow him to concentrate entirely
    on the co-operatives, as Chairman of Tsentrosoyuz.[Central Council of Co-operative
    Societies.—Translator.]
It has been decided, as the chief principle, that the commodity exchange
    in this case is to be handled by the People’s Commissariat for Food,
    mostly and even chiefly, through Tsentrosoyuz and the co-operatives. These
    relations between the People’s Commissariat for Food and Tsentrosoyuz
    should be formalised in an agreement, stating that all the goods available
    for exchange shall be handed over by the People’s Commissariat for
    Food to Tsentrosoyuz. This makes the latter’s role quite clear, and
    there is no need to go into it in detail. Thus, it has fallen to me to
    introduce the question of the general significance of this policy, and I
    should merely like to supplement what I have already said in the pamphlet.
    I have no direct information as to how this question is being presented in
    the localities or to the flaws, defects and unclarity that there prevail. I
    may have to elaborate certain points later on, when it becomes clearer from
    the questions that are raised at the conference, or from the subsequent
    debate, how the local officials and the Party are to be oriented.
As far as I can see, the misunderstandings and lack of clarity on the
    political tasks connected with the tax in kind and the New Economic Policy
    are perhaps due to the exaggeration of this or that aspect of the matter.
    But until we have organised this work on practical lines, these
    exaggerations are absolutely inevitable; and until we have carried out at
    least one food campaign on the new lines, it will hardly be possible at all
    to give any precise definition to the real limits for the application of
    this or that specific feature of this policy. I shall deal only in general
    outline with some of the contradictions which, as far as I could judge from
    several notes sent up at the meeting, have given rise to most
    misunderstanding. The tax in Knd and the attendant changes in our policy
    are often interpreted as a sign of a drastic reversal of policy. It is not
    surprising that this interpretation is taken up and made most of by the
    whiteguard, particularly the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik, press
    abroad. I do not know whether it is due to the operation of similar
    influences which have made themselves felt on the territory of the
    R.S.F.S.R., or to the acute discontent which was, and perhaps still is,
    evident in certain circles, owing to the extreme aggravation of the food
    situation, but this sort of perplexity may have spread to some extent even
    in this country and created what is largely a wrong conception of the
    significance of the change that has been brought about and of the character
    of the new policy.
Naturally, in view of the fact that the peasantry preponderates
    enormously among the population, the principal task—of our policy in
    general, and of our economic policy in particular—is to establish
    definite relations between the working class and the peasantry. For the
    first time in modern history we have a social system from which the
    exploiting class has been eliminated but in which there are two different
    classes—the working class and the peasantry. The enormous
    preponderance of the peasantry could not but have an effect on our economic
    policy, and our policy in general. The principal problem that still
    confronts us—and will inevitably confront us for many years to
    come—is that of establishing proper relations between these two
    classes, proper from the standpoint of abolishing classes. The enemies of
    the Soviet power discuss the formula of agreement between the working class
    and the peasantry with such frequency, and so very often use it against us,
    because it is so vague. Agreement between the working class and the
    peasantry may be taken to mean anything. Unless we assume that, from the
    working-class standpoint, an agreement is possible in principle,
    permissible, and correct only if it supports the dictatorship of the
    working class and is one of the measures aimed at the abolition of classes,
    then, of course, it remains a formula on which all the enemies of the
    Soviet-power, all the enemies of the dictatorship, operate. How is this
    agreement to be realised in the first period of our revolution, i.e., the
    period which we can now approximately consider as coming to a close? How
    was the dictatorship of the proletariat maintained and consolidated amidst
    the enormous preponderance of the peasant population? It is the Civil War
    that was the principal reason, the principal motive force, and the
    principal determinant of our agreement. Although, in many cases, the Civil
    War was started with the whiteguards, the Socialist-Revolutionaries, and
    the Mensheviks jointly participating in the alliance against us, it
    invariably led to all the Socialist-Revolutionary Constituent Assembly and
    Menshevik elements finding themselves—either through a coup
    d’etat or otherwise—driven into the background, which left
    the capitalist and landowner elements to head the whiteguard movement. That
    was the case under Kolchak and Denikin, and all the numerous smaller
    regimes and during campaigns against us. It was the principal factor that
    determined the form of the alliance between the proletariat and the
    peasantry. This circumstance multiplied our incredible difficulties, but
    upon the other hand, it spared us the necessity of racking our brains over
    how to apply the alliance formula, for it and the conditions of its
    realisation were both dictated by the circumstances of war, leaving us no
    choice whatsoever.
Only the working class could exercise the dictatorship in the form
    demanded by the Civil War and its conditions. The participation of the
    landowners in this war united the working class and the peasantry
    absolutely, unreservedly and irrevocably. In that respect there was no
    internal political wavering whatsoever. Amidst the gigantic difficulties
    that confronted us because Russia was cut off from her principal grain
    areas and food hardships had been aggravated to the extreme, we could not
    have carried out our food policy in practice without the appropriation of
    surplus grain. This meant taking not only the surplus stocks of grain,
    which would hardly have sufficed even if they had been properly
    distributed. I cannot here deal in detail with the irregularities which the
    system brought in its train. At all events, it served its main
    purpose—keeping industry going even when we were almost completely
    cut off from the grain districts. But this could have been at all
    satisfactory only in conditions of war. As soon as we had finally done away
    with the external enemy—and this became a fact only in
    1921—another task confronted us, the task of establishing an
    economic alliance between the working class and the peasantry. It
    was only in the spring of 1921 that we actually got down to this task, and
    that was when the 1920 crop failure had worsened the condition of the
    peasantry to an incredible degree, and when we first witnessed some
    internal political wavering, which did not result from external enemy
    pressure, but from the relations between the working class and the
    peasantry. If wehad had a very good, or at least a good, harvest in 1920,
    if the surplus appropriations had yielded 400 million out of the planned
    420 million poods of grain, we would have been able to fulfil the
    greater part of our industrial programme and would have had a stock of
    manufactured urban goods to exchange for agricultural produce. But the
    opposite happened. A fuel crisis, even more acute than the food crisis,
    developed in some places and it was utterly impossible to satisfy the needs
    of the peasant farms in urban manufactures. Peasant farming was gripped by
    an incredibly acute crisis. Those were the circumstances that suggested
    that we could not possibly continue with the old food policy. We had to
    bring up the question of what economic basis we required immediately for
    the alliance between the working class and the peasantry as a stepping
    stone to further measures.
The stepping stone is to prepare the exchange of industrial goods for
    agricultural produce; to create a system under which the peasant would not
    have to surrender his produce otherwise than in exchange for urban and
    factory-made goods, but which would not subordinate him to any of the forms
    existing under the capitalist system. In view of the prevailing economic
    conditions, however, we could not even think about that. That is why we
    have adopted the transitional form I have spoken about, namely, to take
    produce in the form of a tax without giving any equivalent, and to obtain
    additional produce through the medium of exchange. But this requires an
    appropriate fund; ours is extremely small, and the possibility of
    augmenting it through foreign trade has arisen only this year, as a result
    of a number of agreements with capitalist countries. It is true that these
    are as yet a mere introduction, a foreword; no real trade has yet begun.
    There is continued sabotage and all sorts of attempts to disrupt these
    agreements by most or the greater part of the capitalist circles, and the
    most characteristic thing is that the Russian whiteguard press, including
    the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik press, is hammering away at these
    agreements with more venom than at anything else. It is absolutely clear
    that the bourgeoisie is better prepared for the fight, that it is more
    developed than the proletariat, that its class-consciousness has been given
    a keener edge by all the “trouble” it has had to put up with,
    and that it is betraying an abnormal sensitiveness. A close look at the
    whiteguard press will show that it is hitting out at the very point that is
    the centre, the pivot, of our policy.
After the failure of the military invasion, which has quite obviously
    collapsed, although the struggle is still on, the whole of the whiteguard
    Russian press has set itself an unattainable aim: to tear up the trade
    agreements. The campaign which was started this spring on an extremely
    extensive scale, with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in the
    forefront of the counter-revolutionary forces, had a definite aim—to
    tear up the economic agreements between Russia and the capitalist world by
    this spring; and to a considerable extent they succeeded in achieving their
    aim. It is true that we have concluded the principal agreements—their
    number is increasing—and we are overcoming the growing resistance to
    them. But there has been a very dangerous delay; for, without some
    assistance from abroad, rehabilitation of large-scale industry and
    restoration of regular exchange of commodities will either be impossible or
    will mean very dangerous delay. These are the conditions in which we are
    obliged to act, and these are the conditions which for the peasants have
    brought the question of restoring trade to the forefront. I shall not deal
    with the question of concessions, because it has been debated most at Party
    meetings, and has not lately given rise to any perplexity. The position is
    that we are continuing our assiduous offers of concessions, but the foreign
    capitalists have not yet received a single sizable concession, and we have
    not yet concluded any really serious concessions agreement. The whole
    difficulty lies in finding a way of enlisting West-European capital that
    has been tested in practice.
Theoretically, it is absolutely indisputable—and it seems to me
    that everyone ‘s doubts on this score have been
    dispelled—theoretically, I say, it is absolutely clear that it would
    be to our advantage to pay off European capital with a few score or
    hundreds of millions, which we could give it in order to augment, in the
    shortest possible time, our stocks of equipment, materials, raw materials
    and machinery for the purpose of restoring our large-scale industry.
Large-scale industry is the one and only real basis upon which we can
    multiply our resources and build a socialist society. Without large
    factories, such as capitalism has created, without highly developed
    large-scale industry, socialism is impossible anywhere; still less is it
    possible in a peasant country, and we in Russia have a far more concrete
    knowledge of this than before; so that instead of speaking about restoring
    large-scale industry in some indefinite and abstract way, we now speak of
    the definite, precisely calculated and concrete plan of electrification. We
    have a precise plan projected by the best Russian specialists and
    scientists, a plan which gives us a definite picture of the resources,
    considering Russia’s natural features, with which we can, must and
    will lay the basis of large-scale industry for our economy. Without it, no
    real socialist foundation for our economic life is possible. This remains
    absolutely indisputable, and if, in connection with the tax in kind, we
    have lately spoken about it in abstract terms, we must now say definitely
    that we must first of all restore large-scale industry. I myself have heard
    statements of this kind from several comrades, and all I could do in reply
    was, of course, to shrug my shoulders. It is absolutely ridiculous and
    absurd to assume that we could ever lose sight of this fundamental aim. The
    only question that arises here is: how could such doubts and perplexity
    arise in the minds of comrades, and how could they think that this key
    task, without which the material production basis of socialism is
    impossible, has been pushed into the background? These comrades must have
    misunderstood the relation between our state and small industry. Our main
    task is to restore large-scale industry, but in order to approach this task
    at all seriously and systematically we must restore small industry. Both
    this year, 1921, and last year, we had great gaps in our efforts to restore
    large-scale industry.
In the autumn and winter of 1920 we started several important branches
    of our large-scale industry, but we had to suspend them again. Why? Many
    factories were able to obtain enough manpower and sufficient supplies of
    raw materials; why then was work at these factories suspended? Because we
    were short of food and fuel. Without a state reserve of 400 million
    poods of grain (I take an approximate figure) backed up by regular
    monthly allotments, it is difficult to talk about any sort of regular
    economic development or of restoring large-scale industry. Without it we
    find that after having started work on restoring large-scale industry and
    continuing it for several months we have had to suspend it again. Most of
    the few factories that were started are now idle. Without fully assured and
    adequate food stocks the state cannot concentrate on systematically
    organising the rehabilitation of large-scale industry, organising it on a
    modest scale, perhaps, but in such a way as to keep it going
    continuously.
As regards fuel, until the Donbas is restored, and until we obtain a
    regular supply of oil, we shall have to continue to rely on timber, on
    firewood, which again means dependence on small-scale production.
That explains the mistake of those comrades who failed to understand why
    it is the peasant who must now be placed in the centre of things. Some
    workers say: the peasants are being favoured, but we get nothing. I have
    heard such talk, but I must say I think it is not very widespread, for such
    talk is dangerous, because it echoes the Socialist-Revolutionaries. It is
    an obvious political provocation; and is, besides, a survival of
    craft—not class—but craft-union prejudices of workers, when the
    working class regards itself a part of equitable capitalist society and
    fails to realise that it still stands on the old capitalist basis. These
    workers say, in fact: the peasant is being favoured, he has been relieved
    of surplus-grain appropriation, he is allowed to retain his grain surplus
    for the purpose of exchange; we workers at the bench want to have the same
    thing.
What is at the bottom of this point of view? It is, in essence, the old
    petty-bourgeois ideology: since the peasants are a component part of
    capitalist society, the working class also remains a component part of this
    society; hence, if the peasant trades, we too must trade. Here we
    undoubtedly see a revival of the old prejudices which grapple the worker to
    the old world. The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks are the most
    ardent and, in fact, the only sincere, champions of the old capitalist
    world. You will find none among the hundreds, the thousands, and even the
    hundreds of thousands in all the other camps. But these rare specimens
    remain among the so-called pure democrats, whom the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks represent. And the more
    persistently they advocate their views, the more dangerous is their
    influence over the working class. They are doubly dangerous when the
    working class has to go through periods of suspended production. The
    principal material basis for the development of proletarian
    class-consciousness is large-scale industry, where the worker sees the
    factories running, and daily feels the power that can really abolish
    classes.
When the workers lose their footing in this material production basis,
    some of them are beset by a sense of instability, uncertainty, despair and
    skepticism, and this has a definite effect when combined with outright
    provocations by our bourgeois democrats, i.e., the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. This produces a mentality which
    makes people, even in the ranks of the Communist Party, reason in this way:
    the peasants were given a handout; for the same reasons, and by the same
    methods, a handout should be given to the workers. We have had to yield to
    this mentality to some extent. The decree on bonuses to workers in the form
    of a part of the goods they produce is, of course, a concession to these
    sentiments, which have their roots in the past and are engendered by
    skepticism and despair. Within certain small limits, this concession was
    necessary. It has been made. But we must not for a moment forget that we
    have been making a concession that is necessary from no other standpoint
    but the economic one: the interests of the proletariat. Its basic and most
    vital interests are bound up with the rehabilitation of large-scale
    industry as a solid economic foundation. When that is done, it will
    consolidate its dictatorship, it will be sure to carry its dictatorship to
    success, in the teeth of all the political and military difficulties. Why,
    then, were we obliged to make a concession, and why would it be extremely
    dangerous to give it a wider interpretation than it deserves? It is only
    because temporary food and fuel difficulties compelled us to take this
    path.
What is the principal economic determinant of the policy when we say,
    “We must not base our relations with the peasants on surplus-grain
    appropriation but on a tax"? It is that under the surplus-grain
    appropriation system the small peasant farms have no proper economic basis
    and are doomed to remain dead for many years. Small farming cannot exist
    and develop, because the petty farmer loses interest in consolidating and
    developing his activity and in increasing his output, all of which leaves
    us without an economic basis. We have no other basis or source, and unless
    the state is able to accumulate large stocks of food it is no use thinking
    about the rehabilitation of large-scale industry. That is why we are first
    of all applying this policy which is changing our food relations.
We are conducting this policy so as to have a fund for the
    rehabilitation of large-scale industry; to relieve the working class from
    all interruption of work, which should not be experienced even by our
    large-scale industry, miserable though it is when compared with that of the
    advanced colmtries; to relieve the proletarian of the need to find the
    means of subsistence by resorting to the petty-bourgeois method of
    profiteering, which is not a proletarian method and threatens us with the
    gravest economic dangers. Owing to our present deplorable conditions,
    proletarians are obliged to earn a living by methods which are not
    proletarian and are not connected with large-scale industry. They are
    obliged to procure goods by petty-bourgeois profiteering methods, either by
    stealing, or by making them for themselves in a publicly-owned factory, in
    order to barter them for agricultural produce—and that is the main
    economic danger, jeopardising the existence of the Soviet system. The
    proletariat must now exercise its dictatorship in such a way as to have a
    sense of security as a class, with a firm footing. But the ground is
    slipping from under its feet. Instead of large, continuously running
    factories, the proletarian sees something quite different, and is compelled
    to enter the economic sphere as a profiteer, or as a small producer.
We must spare no sacrifice in this transitional period to save the
    proletariat from this. To ensure the continuous, if slow, rehabilitation of
    large-scale industry we must not hesitate to throw sops to the greedy
    foreign capitalists, because, from the standpoint of building socialism, it
    is at present to our advantage to overpay the foreign capitalists some
    hundreds of millions in order to obtain the machines and materials for the
    rehabilitation of large-scale industry, which will restore the economic
    basis of the proletariat, and will transform it into a steadfast
    proletariat, instead of one engaged in profiteering. The Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries have deafened us with their shouts that since the
    proletariat has been declassed, we ought to abandon the tasks of the
    dictatorship of the proletariat. They have been shouting that since 1917,
    and the surprising thing is that they have not grown tired of shouting it
    up to 1921. But when we hear these attacks we do not say that there has
    been no declassing, and that there are no flaws. What we say is that
    Russian and international realities are such that even though the
    proletariat has to go through a period when it is declassed, and has to
    suffer from these handicaps, it can nevertheless fulfil its task of winning
    and holding political power.
It would be absurd and ridiculous to deny that the fact that the
    proletariat is declassed is a handicap. By 1921, we realised that after the
    struggle against the external enemy, the main danger and the greatest evil
    confronting us was our inability to ensure the continuous operation of the
    few remaining large enterprises. This is the main thing. Without such an
    economic basis, the working class cannot firmly hold political power. In
    order to ensure the continued rehabilitation of large-scale industry we
    must organise the food supply in such a way as to collect and properly
    distribute a fund of, say, 400 million poods. It would be utterly
    impossible for us to collect it through the old surplus-grain appropriation
    system: 1920 and 1921 are proof of this. Now we see that we can nonetheless
    fulfil this extremely difficult task by means of the tax in kind. We cannot
    fulfil it with the old methods, and so we must try some new ones. It can be
    done by means of the tax in kind and by establishing proper relations with
    the peasant as a small producer. We have devoted considerable effort to
    prove this theoretically.
I think, judging by the Party press and by what is being said at
    meetings, that it has been fully proved theoretically that this task can be
    fulfilled if the proletariat retains possession of the transport system,
    the big factories, the economic basis as well as political power. We must
    give the peasant a fair amount of leeway as a small producer. Unless we
    revive peasant farming we shall not solve the food problem.
It is within this framework that we must deal with the question of
    developing small industry on the basis oI unrestricted trade and free
    turnover. This free turnover is a means to establish economically stable
    relations between the working class and the peasantry. We now have more and
    more precise data on agricultural output. A pamphlet on grain output was
    distributed at the Party Congress; it was still in proofs when it was
    distributed to the delegates. Since then the material contained in it has
    been supplemented and circulated. The pamphlet in its final form has now
    been sent to the press, but it is not yet ready for the conference, and I
    am unable to say whether it will be ready before the conference comes to a
    close and the delegates disperse. We shall do all we can to get it out in
    time, but we cannot promise to do so.
This is a small part of our effort to determine, as precisely as
    possible, the position in regard to agricultural output, and the resources
    at our disposal.
Still, we can say that there is evidence that we are quite able to solve
    this economic problem, particularly this year, when the harvest prospects
    are not too bad, or not as bad as we anticipated in spring. This assures us
    of the possibility of accumulating an agricultural reserve that will enable
    us to devote ourselves entirely to the task of steadily, even if slowly,
    restoring our large-scale industry.
In order to solve the problem of accumulating food stocks for industry
    we must devise a form of relations with the peasant, the small proprietor,
    and there is no other form except that of the tax in kind; no one has come
    up with another form, and one can be imagined. But we must have a practical
    solution of this problem: we must arrange to have the tax collected in a
    proper manner, and not in the old way, when grain was taken two or three
    times, leaving the peasant in a worse plight than ever, inflicting the most
    suffering on the more industrious and destroying every possibility of
    establishing economically stable relations. The tax in kind, while also a
    levy on every peasant, must be collected in a different way. On the basis
    of the collected and published data we can say that the tax in kind will
    now bring about a crucial change, but whether it will cover everything is
    still, to some extent, an open question. Of one thing we can be quite
    certain, however, and it is that we must bring about an immediate
    improvement in the condition of the peasant.
The task that confronts the local workers is to collect the tax in kind
    in full, and do so in the shortest possible time. The difficulties are
    increased by the fact that the harvest promises to be an unusually early
    one this year, and if our preparations are based on the customary dates, we
    run the risk of being too late. That is why the early convocation of the
    Party conference was important and opportune. We must work more quickly
    than before to prepare the apparatus for collecting the tax in kind. The
    accumulation of a minimum state fund of 240 million poods of grain
    and the possibility of making the position of the peasant secure depend on
    the speed with which the tax in kind is collected. Delay in collecting it
    will cause a certain amount of inconvenience to the peasant. The tax will
    not be paid voluntarily, we shall not be able to dispense with coercion,
    for the levy imposes some restrictions on the peasant farm. If we drag out
    the process of collecting the tax, the peasant will be discontent and will
    say that he is not free to dispose of his surplus. If the freedom is to be
    such in practice, the tax must be collected quickly; the tax-collector must
    not hover over the peasant for long, and so the period between the
    harvesting and the collection of the tax in full must be reduced to a
    minimum.
That is one task. The other is to maximise the peasant’s freedom
    of trade and the revival of small-scale industry, so as to allow some
    leeway to the capitalism that grows up on the basis of small private
    property and petty trade. We should not be afraid of it, for it is not
    dangerous to us in the least.
We need not fear it at all in view of the general economic and political
    situation that has now arisen, with the proletariat controlling all the
    sources of large-scale production, and denationalisation in any shape or
    form entirely out of the question. At a time when we are suffering most of
    all from a severe shortage of goods and utter impoverishment, it is
    ridiculous to fear the threat of capitalism based on small commercial
    agriculture. To fear it is to fail altogether to take account of the
    relation of forces in our economy. It means to fail to understand that the
    peasant economy, as a small-scale peasant economy, cannot be stable at all
    without some free exchange and the attendant capitalist relations.
This is what you must firmly impress on your minds, comrades. And our
    main task is to give a push to the comrades in all the localities, to give
    them the utmost scope for initiative, to stimulate them to display the
    utmost self-reliance and boldness. In this respect we are still suffering
    from the fear of doing things on a really wide scale. We have no more or
    less definitely tabulated local data showing from practical experience what
    the situation is in regard to local goods exchange and trade, what success
    has been achieved in restoring and developing small industry—which
    can alleviate the condition of the peasant right away, without the great
    effort of transporting large stocks of food and fuel to the industrial
    centres that large-scale industry entails. From the general economic
    standpoint, not enough is being done locally in this respect. We have no
    information on this from the localities, we do not know what the position
    is all over the Republic, we have no examples of really well-organised
    work; and my impression is that the Trade Union Congress and the Congress
    of the Supreme Economic Council[2] have none either.
Here again, the principal defect of these congresses is that we devote
    ourselves mainly to such threadbare things as theses, general programmes
    and arguments, instead of giving the participants a chance to swap local
    experience and say, on returning home: “Out of a thousand examples we
    heard one good one, and we shall follow it.” Actually, we have not
    only one good example in a thousand, we have many more; but least of all do
    we see congress work arranged in this way.
I have no wish to forestall events, but I must say a word or two about
    collective supplies for the workers, i.e., about the proposal to substitute
    for the ration system a system under which certain factories that are
    actually in operation will be assured of a certain quantity of food in
    proportion to their output. The idea is an excellent one, but we have
    turned it into something semi-fantastic, without however doing any real
    preparatory work for it. We have no example as yet of any particular
    factory, even one employing a small number of workers, in a particular
    uyzed, having tried out this system and having secured
    such-and-such results. That is something we do not as yet have, and it is
    one of the greatest drawbacks in our work. We must keep repeating that
    instead of discussing general problems, which was all very well in 1918,
    i.e., in the long distant past, we must, in this 1921, discuss practical
    problems. By telling congresses first of all about the examples of
    well-organised work—there are quite enough of them—we would
    make it an obligation for the rest to strive to imitate the best that has
    been achieved in a few rare and exceptional localities. I have in mind the
    work of the Trade Union Congress, but it also applies to all work connected
    with the food problem.
Quite a lot has been done in some cases, in a few localities, to prepare
    for the collection of the tax in kind, the organisation of trade, etc., but
    we have not managed to study this experience; and the great task that
    confronts us now is to induce the vast majority of the localities to follow
    the example of the best. Our task now is to study practical experience and
    raise the backward and medium uyzeds and volosts, the
    standard of which is absolutely unsatisfactory, to the level of the
    insignificant number of highly satisfactory ones. At our congresses we must
    shift our main attention from the study of general theses and programmes of
    meetings to the study of practical experience, to the study of the examples
    set by the satisfactory and highly satisfactory districts, and to raising
    the backward and medium ones, which predominate, to the level of these good
    ones, which may be few but are still there.
Those are the remarks to which I must confine myself.
    (Applause.)
3. Summing-Up Speech On The Tax In Kind May 27
Comrades, although many comrades from the provinces have expressed
    dissatisfaction with the reports and the debate, it seems to me that we
    have, at any rate, achieved one object—we have ascertained how the
    new policy is understood and applied locally. The conference could hardly
    have set itself any other aim than that of securing an exchange of opinion
    for the purpose of thoroughly assimilating this new policy and of
    unanimously proceeding to its proper application. This we have achieved.
    True, there has been some perplexity and even wavering, which,
    unfortunately, in some cases, went far beyond perplexity over practical
    questions and conjectures about whether the new policy was meant
    “seriously” or “notseriously", and for how long. What
    Comrade Vareikis said, for example, was really not communist at all, and in
    content smacked of Menshevism. I must say this quite bluntly. How could he
    keep asking: “Tell us, is the peasantry a class, or not a
    class?” Of course, it is a class. In that case, he says, it must have
    political concessions, or, if not that, then certain measures should be
    taken in that direction, which will resemble Zubatovism[3] just the
    same.
Reference was made here to the fact that Martov had put the case
    squarely, whereas Vareikis was adding: “To a certain extent",
    “to some degree", “partly". This caused incredible, monstrous
    confusion. It is the same sort of confusion that was displayed when we were
    being accused of employing force. Again we have to explain that when we
    speak of dictatorship we mean the employment of coercion. Every-state
    implies employment of coercion; but the whole difference lies in whether it
    is employed against the exploited or against the exploiters. Is it employed
    against the toiling and exploited class? The same applies to the reference
    to Zubatovism. What was Zubatovism? It was support for the oppressor class
    by means of small economic concessions to the oppressed classes. That is
    why the response at that time was: economic concessions will not help you
    to induce the proletariat, the class that is fighting for the emancipation
    of all the oppressed, to abandon the idea of capturing political power and
    of destroying the system of oppression. At present the proletariat holds
    power and guides the state. It guides the peasantry. What does that mean?
    It means, first, pursuing a course towards the abolition of classes, and
    not towards the small producer. If we strayed from this bedrock course we
    should cease to be socialists and would find ourselves in the camp of the
    petty bourgeoisie, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who are
    now the proletariat’s most bitter enemies. Not long ago Comrade
    Bukharin quoted in Pravda some utterances of such a serious
    political thinker as Milyukov (Chernov and Martov come nowhere near him),
    who argued that only a socialist party could occupy the arena of political
    struggle in Russia today. And since the “socialist” parties,
    the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks, desire to take the
    trouble of fighting the Bolsheviks, they “are welcome to try". That
    is literally what Milyukov said, and it proves that he is cleverer than
    Martov and Chernov, simply because he is a representative of the big
    bourgeoisie (even if he personally had less brains than Chernov and
    Martov). Milyukov is right. He takes a very sober account of the stages of
    political development and says that Socialist-Revolutionism and Menshevism
    are the necessary stepping stones leading to a reversion to capitalism. The
    bourgeoisie needs such stepping stones, and whoever does not understand
    this is stupid.
From the standpoint of the interests of the bourgeoisie, Milyukov is
    absolutely right. Since we, being the party of the proletariat, are leading
    the peasantry, we must pursue a course towards strengthening large-scale
    industry, and must therefore be prepared to make economic concessions. The
    proletariat led the peasantry, and did it in such a way that during the
    Civil War the peasantry obtained more economic benefits than the
    proletariat. In Martov’s terms, this is Zubatovism. Economic
    concessions have been made to the peasantry. These concessions were made to
    a section of the working people constituting the majority of the
    population. Is this policy wrong? No, it is the only correct one! And no
    matter what you say about Martov’s catchwords, about it heing
    impossible to deceive a class, I ask you nevertheless: where is our
    deception? We say that there are two paths to choose: one following Martov
    and Chernov—and through them to Milyukov—and the other
    following the Communists. As for us, we are fighting for the abolition of
    capitalism and the establishment of communism. Ours is a very hard road,
    and many are weary and lack faith. The peasants lack faith. But are we
    deceiving them? It is ridiculous to say that we are deceiving a class, and
    have lost our way amidst three pines, or even two, for the working class
    and the peasantry are only two classes. The proletariat leads the
    peasantry, which is a class that cannot be driven out as the landowners and
    capitalists were driven out and destroyed. We must remould it by prolonged
    and persistent effort, entailing great privation. It depends on us, the
    ruling party, how much of the suffering will fall to the lot of the
    proletariat and how much to that of the peasantry. How is this suffering to
    be shared? Is it to be on a basis of equality? Let Chernov and Martov say
    that. We say that we must be guided by the interests of the proletariat,
    that is, we must obtain safeguards against the restoration of capitalism
    and ensure the road to communism. Since the peasantry is now wearier and
    more exhausted, or rather it thinks that it is so, we make more concessions
    to it in order to obtain safeguards against the restoration of capitalism
    and to ensure the road to communism. That is the correct policy, and we are
    guided exclusively by class considerations. We tell the peasants frankly
    and honestly, without any deception: in order to hold the road to
    socialism, we are making a number of concessions to you, comrade peasants,
    but only within the stated limits and to the stated extent; and, of course,
    we ourselves shall be the judge of the limits and the extent. The
    concession itself is being made with an eye to distributing the burdens
    which, up to now, the proletariat has borne to a larger extent than the
    peasantry. During the three and a half years of the dictatorship of the
    proletariat, it has voluntarily borne more hardships than the peasantry.
    This is an absolutely obvious and incontrovertible truth. This is how the
    question stands in regard to the relations between the proletariat, and the
    peasantry: either the peasantry comes to an agreement with us and we make
    economic concessions to it—or we fight. That is why all other
    arguments are but evidence of a terrible confusion. As a matter of fact,
    any other road leads to Milyukov, and the restoration of the landowners and
    capitalists. We say that we shall agree to make any concession within the
    limits of what will sustain and strengthen the power of the proletariat,
    which, in spite of all difficulties and obstacles, is unswervingly
    advancing towards the abolition of classes and towards communism.
The next point is that much of the criticism of Comrade
    Svidersky’s speech was wrong. All the members of the opposition at
    once hurled themselves upon him with what might be called brilliant
    parliamentary speeches, Comrade Larin proving to be the most brilliant
    representative of the “parliamentary opposition". The Soviet system
    does not provide many opportunities for making parliamentary speeches; but
    nature asserts herself, and although we have no parliamentary institutions,
    the parliamentary manner survives. Concerning Comrade Svidersky they
    complained that he had proposed the introduction of a food supply
    inspectorate, and had even gone to the length of talking about a food
    dictatorship. Comrade Svidersky may have overstated his case, but he is
    right in substance. We distributed the reporters’ roles in such a way
    that each played on a different instrument, as it were. The report on the
    question of exchange was made by the representative of Tsentrosoyuz,
    Comrade Khinchuk—the co-operator. As you are well aware, Tsentrosoyuz
    has concluded an agreement with the state. If some of the comrades have not
    read it, this only goes to show that they have not treated the material of
    the conference in a business-like way. Our state concludes an agreement
    with the representative of Tsentrosoyuz: the representative of the
    People’s Commissariat for Food concludes an agreement with the
    representative of the co-operative societies, and co-operators abroad must
    reckon with our agreement. Under the agreement all goods are delivered to
    the co-operative societies, so that the co-operators may trade on our
    behalf—on behalf of the centralised state, the big factories, and the
    proletariat—but not on their own behalf. This is a major and most
    important condition, because there can be no other arrangement. Petrograd
    and Moscow are starving, while the well-fed gubernias, as Comrade
    Bryukhanov’s figures show, have eaten twice as much, and sent us half
    as much as they should have. What do you say: in the circumstances, do we
    or do we not need a food dictatorship? I think we do; we need it very much,
    indeed, because there is any amount of this laxity all over the country.
    You must realise that we cannot do without coercion, and Tsentrosoyuz must
    do the distributing under our control.
We say to Tsentrosoyuz: you have traded well and we will give you a
    bonus in the form of a definite percentage. This is stipulated in the
    agreement, and we will encourage this commission-basis trading by every
    sort of bonus system. We will give a bonus for profitable trade; but we
    will demand that this trade is carried on for our benefit, for the benefit
    of the state, which has centralised large-scale industry, and which is
    governed by the proletariat. Does large-scale industry stand to gain? Who
    stands to gain?
How can you ensure food supplies without a tax? You cannot. We do not
    know whether the tax or the exchange will yield most, but we do
    know—and it is a fact—that we lack an adequate fund for
    exchange. At the present time, you cannot get what you need without an
    instrument of coercion. Never! This is obvious. And in this, Svidersky, as
    a representative of his line, is absolutely right. We have approved of the
    establishment of a food supply inspectorate, and the Presidium of the
    All-Russia Central Executive Committee will bring more pressure to bear on
    you because you know who ought to be appointed; that is your business; but
    once you make the appointment, see that the man does his job. Things being
    what they are, unless the state is assured of approximately 400 million
    poods of grain, it is no use talking about large-scale industry
    and socialist construction. Those who have not learned this in the course
    of the past three years are not worth arguing with. But in spite of our
    numerous mistakes, we have increased this fund. True, while increasing the
    fund in 1920, we blundered over distribution, but enormous progress was
    made nonetheless. We must approach the subject soberly and say that to
    collect the tax in kind we need an expeditious apparatus, and it is no use
    making liberal speeches and hinting that a food supply inspectorate is such
    a nasty thing.
I am not aware of the existence of a “communist” system
    under which you could expect to collect—without coercion—a tax
    from the peasantry constituting a majority of the population in the period
    of transition from capitalism to communism. If you want to sustain
    large-scale industry—the basis of the proletarian
    dictatorship—then you must want this apparatus to function. And this,
    naturally, demands centralism. Look at the figures. Unfortunately, few of
    you are sufficiently familiar with them. See how much the localities have
    kept for themselves, in spite of the orders from the centre. The comrades
    from Moscow and Petrograd have quoted figures here showing that the orders
    from the centre are not being fully carried out. It turns out that three
    reminders were given, and an equal number of censures. What else is there
    to do? There remains nothing but dismissal, arrest and so forth. (A
    voice : “How many such cases were there?") There were many cases
    of infringements, but few dismissals. That is what I wanted to say in
    defence of this line of policy.
The harvest this year will evidently be a fair one in many parts, and
    will set in earlier than we expected. Hence, we must make preparations
    beforehand, the situation now being such that we must swiftly collect the
    main fund. Consequently, it is absolutely wrong to take the approach that
    many did here.
As for Comrade Larin, his talents lie more in the sphere of
    parliamentary opposition and journalism than business efficiency. He is
    tireless in the drawing-up of projects. He mentioned that he had proposed a
    good plan as early as January 1920, but if we were to collect all of his
    projects and pick out the good ones, we would probably find that they add
    up to one in ten thousand.
On May 10, he submitted a scheme to the Central Committee’s
    Political Bureau for a general introduction of a collective supply system.
    Its main principle is alluring, but when was it proposed? On May 10, 1921,
    when there was an absolute shortage of food in centres like Moscow and
    Petrograd, when these important centres of the Russian Republic were
    temporarily doomed to semi-starvation and even worse. It is ridiculous to
    propose a reshuffle of the food supply organisations at a time when men are
    on their last legs, and are overworking the trunk-lines to Siberia, the
    Caucasus and the Ukraine, in an effort to track down every trainload, every
    car almost. What the devil is the use of introducing a collective supply
    system at a time like that? The Political Bureau adopted the following
    resolution: “That the scheme proposed by Larin and the All-Russia
    Central Council of Trade Unions [the A.C.C.T.U., of course, hastened to put
    its signature to it] be rejected; that the author of the scheme be
    instructed to re-examine the question with greater care, in the light of
    the actual possibilities of obtaining supplies. . . .” This principle
    was reiterated (in Chubar’s and Holtzmann’s theses, if you have
    read them) at the Trade Union Congress; Chubar had formulated the main
    parts of his theses in harmony with the policy of circumspection laid down
    by the Party’s Central Committee. Holtzmann and Larin behaved
    according to the rule which Larin, half in jest, whispered in my ear at the
    end of the meeting of the Political Bureau. (I don’t think I shall be
    committing an indiscretion if I relate this conversation.) When Larin saw
    that the resolution had been adopted he said to me: “You have given
    us your little finger, but we will take your hand.” Then I said to
    myself—although I had known it before—now we know how to
    bargain with Larin. If he asks for a million rubles, offer him fifty
    kopeks. (Laughter.) During the debate, when Larin was asked for
    the facts, he quoted the example (which he said was “brilliant") of
    the construction of the Kizlyar-Staro-Terek railway. Although it has
    already been shown that there is nothing new in this example, that similar
    experiments have been made before, it is a sign of progress to hear
    definite examples and results of experience, instead of general arguments
    and countless theses, It would be disastrous if everyone began reading and
    discussing these theses, nine-tenths of which you cannot read to the end
    without a splitting headache.
It is not theses, but a record of local experience, that we need. Let us
    study this experience, instead of piling system upon system and drawing up
    laws on collective supplies when we lack even the minimum of real supplies.
    Practical work is going on in the localities. We were told: it is not right
    to reproach the localities for not sharing their experiences. The Central
    Committee was reproached here for not giving publicity to local experience.
    But we have none of it: our time is taken up entirely with decrees. The
    majority of us are immersed in this unpleasant work, and that is why we
    cannot see local experience. It is your business to bring it to us. Larin
    was right in quoting the fine example of the Kizlyar-Terek railway, for it
    was a piece of local experience. But even here he allowed his imagination
    to run away with him, and Chubar and Osinsky had to put him right. This is
    not the only example. He said that a worker received 28 pounds under the
    old system and four poods under the new system. I was doubtful
    about the figures and so I asked him: Where did you get that from? He
    replied that they had been certified by the Workers’ and
    Peasants’ Inspection. But we know that Larin is not only a
    parliamentary man, but also a cartoonist. First, he drew a cartoon
    satirising the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. And now he
    says: four poods instead of 28 pounds—certified by the
    Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. First, he undermines
    confidence in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection by relating
    anecdotes of that kind, and then presents the certificate of the
    Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection as sole proof. Chubar and
    Osinsky say that this system has been repeatedly employed in the timber
    industry. The whole point is to compare the experience of one locality with
    that of another. The best part of Larin’s statement was his
    description of the work on the Kizlyar-Terek railway. But what we need to
    know is whether things have not been done better in Tula or Tambov. The
    centre cannot tell you that, because we do not know. You should bring us
    this information from the localities, show us the facts, teach us, and we
    will all learn, and try to follow the best example.
The number of local centres, on the uyed or district level,
    with such experience is two or three per thousand, possibly more, but
    surely two or three can be found. This experience must be thoroughly
    studied in a business-like fashion. We must carefully sift the evidence and
    verify the figures, and not rely merely on speeches by the opposition. If
    we do this, the centre will be able to learn.
I think the most important outcome of the debate has been the
    information we got on how the exchange of commodities was begun; the only
    thing lacking was the precise facts. Donbas comrades cabled to say: We have
    obtained 3,000 poods of wheat through exchange. This referred to a
    small district, but there were no details. I expected the comrades to come
    forward here and tell us what they gave in return, and through what
    organisation the exchange was made: the Commissariat for Food, a lessee,
    concessionaire or private entrepreneur? This we do not know; and yet it is
    far more important than our decrees. Decrees can be read, and it is hardly
    worth getting together to discuss them; but it is certainly worth while to
    come together to discuss how they obtained 3,000 poods of wheat in
    the Donbas, and whether the comrades in Volhynia or Tambov have not done
    better. Quite a good deal has been done locally. The comrades should come
    here and tell us the results of their practical experience over there. One
    will say: “I started doing so and so, but was hindered by the central
    organisation.” Another will say: “I managed to bring the
    central organisation to heel.” As for Tambov Gubernia, the comrade
    who delivered a parliamentary speech and thundered against the Commissariat
    for Food vaguely hinted that they had set up co-operative shops and
    agencies. The comrades had accepted this. Over there they have to put up
    with a number of additional difficulties; part of the area has not been
    sown, severe conditions generally, handicap upon handicap. Nevertheless,
    from what he said it is evident that exchange has begun and the
    co-operatives are functioning. Even pomade was mentioned. How much pomade
    did you take? And on what terms was it distributed? You must even trade in
    pomade; when you are trading you must reckon with the demand. If there is a
    demand for pomade, we must supply it. If we run things properly we can
    restore large-scale industry even with the aid of pomade. What we must
    calculate, though, is how much of it we need to buy, or obtain, to be able
    to purchase 1,000 poods of grain. (Voice : What about
    icons; there’s a demand for icons.) As for icons, someone has just
    given a reminder that the peasants are asking for icons. I think that we
    should not follow the example of the capitalist countries and put vodka and
    other intoxicants on the market, because, profitable though they are, they
    will lead us back to capitalism and not forward to communism; but there is
    no such danger in pomade. (Laughter.) As for church bells, we
    differ on that, and some comrades think that in some places the bells will
    soon be voluntarily recast into copper wire for electrification. Besides,
    there are so many of them in Russia at the moment that they can hardly be
    used by religious people for their original purpose, because the need is no
    longer there. As regards Volhynia, it was stated that there are places
    there where they give a pood of grain for ten pounds of salt. But
    how was this transacted? Did you have any agents? How did you trade? Who
    looked after the goods? Who locked up the warehouses? How much was stolen?
    That is the main thing but nothing was said about it at all. Instead, we
    were told that the Poles had given a pood of salt for a
    pood of grain. In conversation with the comrade I said that if the
    Poles offered a pood of salt for a pood of grain and the
    peasants offered you a pood of grain for ten pounds of salt, then
    you could have traded something for yourselves. What prevented you from
    doing that? The centre, it was said. I’m sorry but I simply cannot
    believe that the centre prevented you from obtaining four poods of
    grain for a pood of Polish salt. We could not have opposed a thing
    like that; I refuse to believe it. The comrades complained that before,
    when the army was there, everything had to be done through the military
    authorities; but now that the army is no longer there and there is no war,
    permission must be obtained from the centre. A comrade said that now they
    had the Southern Paper Trust and that they were fighting this Trust. But
    when I asked to whom they had complained about this organisation he
    answered that he did not know. But this is very important.
They were unable to name the body to whom they had sent their complaint
    about the Southern Paper Trust. I do not know what this Paper Trust is. In
    all probability it is a body that suffers from the same bureaucratic
    distortion that all our Soviet organisations are afflicted with. The
    capitalists are still fighting us. We have compelled many of them to seek
    protection under Milyukov’s wing abroad; but many thousands are still
    here, waging war against us according to all the rules of the art of
    bureaucracy. But how are you combating this, comrades? Do you think you can
    take this Paper Trust and all the rest of them with your bare hands? We did
    not fight Denikin with bare hands, but armed ourselves strongly, and
    organised an army. But here we have excellent officials, who consider that
    it is in the interests of their class to play dirty tricks on us, to hamper
    our work; they think that they are saving civilisation by helping to bring
    about the downfall of the Bolsheviks, and they know how to run an office a
    hundred times better than we do. There was nowhere for us to learn this
    business. We must fight them according to all the rules of the art and take
    proceedings against Party comrades who go about lodging complaints, or
    telling anecdotes about the dirty tricks that are being played in some
    office or other. They go about Moscow telling anecdotes about the
    bureaucratic tricks that are being played. But you, comrades, who are
    intelligent Communists, what have you done to combat this?—"I lodged
    a complaint."—Where did you file your complaint? It turns out that no
    complaint had been filed, whereas it should have been sent to the Council
    of People’s Commissars and to the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee; in other words, they should have exercised all their rights
    provided for by our Constitution. Of course, we may suffer a reverse here
    and there in this war. But has there ever been a war, even the most
    victorious, without any reverses? In this one reverses are also possible,
    but the fight must go on. Many of us, however, are not taking it seriously.
    Have you taken legal proceedings against those who are responsible for red
    tape? Has any people’s court convicted anyone for making a worker or
    a peasant call at an office four or five times and finally sending him off
    with an answer which is formally correct, but is essentially sheer mockery?
    You are Communists, aren’t you? Then why don’t you set a trap
    for these bureaucratic gentlemen and then haul them before a people’s
    court, and into prison, for this red tape? How many people have you put
    into prison for red tape? Everyone will say, of course, that it is a
    troublesome business: Someone may be offended. Many take this view, but do
    not find it too much trouble to complain and tell anecdotes. Very often one
    cannot tell the difference between these anecdotes and the slander
    published by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in foreign
    journals. The Mensheviks write: “We have our own correspondents in
    all the Soviet offices in Moscow.” (Laughter.) Quite often
    the anecdotes that are told here, and those with which the speeches of the
    parliamentary opposition are replete, appear in the Menshevik journals a
    few days later. But you should know where to draw the line; you must see
    the difference between a serious struggle and the telling of anecdotes. Of
    course, when people are tired, an anecdote told by a capable speaker may
    help to let off steam. Judging from my own observations this is so, and I
    have no objections from this point of view. But we need something more: we
    must study the methods used to catch the culprits, count up how many were
    caught and brought to trial, and sum up the results obtained. If we proceed
    on these lines we will win this war, although it takes far more skill than
    the Civil War.
I should like to say a word or two about Nikolayev Gubernia. The comrade
    from Nikolayev Gubernia gave us a number of valuable facts, but in most
    cases he gave no details. He said: “There is a demand for textiles
    and iron, but not for pomade.” Others said, however, that there was
    no demand for textiles. The comrade came up against the profiteers, and
    being obliged to pursue the free market policy, he wants to know how to
    combat them. We cannot fight them in the old way; and to fight them in the
    new way we have mounted guards in the transport system, and a number of new
    decrees have been passed; but, of course, no quick results can be expected.
    But where is your local experience in this matter? A number of decrees have
    now been passed for the protection of the transport system, not against the
    profiteers, but against its “improper use". Special commissions,
    Extraordinary Three-Man Commissions have been set up by the Cheka and the
    Transport Cheka; the War Department and the People’s Commissariat for
    Railways are also taking a hand. But what are the bodies functioning in
    your districts? How do they co-ordinate their work? What is being done
    about the complaints that the profiteers are getting the upper hand? How do
    they operate? This is what we ought to discuss. But comrades come here and
    complain: “The profiteers have got the upper hand.” We have
    adopted the decrees. Perhaps they are no good, they must be put to the
    test, but how is this to be done? We test our decrees by publishing them.
    You know them; you come here to discuss them and tell us how they are
    applied. You must tell us: in such and such a place, such and such a
    Transport Three-Man Commission has done the following. In one place it was
    successful, in another it was not. Perhaps the speeches will not be as
    brilliant as those we heard about the food dictatorship; but unless we do
    this we shall never learn to make fewer mistakes in drafting decrees, and
    that is the main thing.
Let me deal in conclusion with the deductions which, I think, Comrade
    Osinsky has quite rightly drawn, and which sum up our activities. His
    deductions were three. First: “Seriously and for a long time". I
    think he is quite right. The policy is a long-term one and is being adopted
    in earnest. We must get this well into our heads and remember it, because,
    owing to the gossip habit, rumours are being spread that we are indulging
    in a policy of expedients, that is to say, political trickery, and that
    what is being done is only for the present day. That is not true. We are
    taking class relationships into account and have our eyes on what the
    proletariat must do to lead the peasantry in the direction of communism in
    spite of everything. Of course, we have to retreat; but we must take it
    very seriously and look at it from the standpoint of class forces. To
    regard it as a trick is to imitate the philistines, the petty bourgeoisie,
    who are alive and kicking not only outside the Communist Party. But I would
    not go along with Comrade Osinsky in his estimate of the period. He said
    “seriously and for a longtime” meant 25 years. I am not that
    pessimistic; I shall refrain from estimating the period, but I think his
    figure is a bit too pessimistic. We shall be lucky to project our policy
    for some 5 or 10 years, because we usually fail to do so even for 5
    weeks.
We must promote enterprising non-Party workers. We must reiterate over
    and over again that, after all is said and done, meetings, congresses and
    conferences held by the Communist Party and other organisations in Soviet
    Russia must not be what they have been in the past, and still are, that is
    to say, assemblies with speeches in the spirit of parliamentary oppositions
    and the drawing up of resolutions. We have so many resolutions that nobody
    even takes the trouble to file them, let alone read them. We must devote
    our attention to business and not to resolutions. Under the bourgeois
    system, business matters were managed by private owners and not by state
    agencies; but now, business matters are our common concern. These are the
    politics that interest us most. Of course, we can denounce the Mensheviks
    for the 999th time, they deserve it; but after all is said and done, this
    is mere repetition, and many of us have now been doing it these thirty
    years. Most of us have had enough of it.
What is much more interesting is how, in this socialist state, we are to
    exchange textiles, pomade and other things for grain, and obtain an extra
    pood of flour in exchange for Polish salt. Although it is not our
    custom, Party meetings must take up the question of enterprise and
    initiative. The whole capitalist world is starving. They have an abundance
    of salt, pomades, and other things of that sort, and if we apply the slogan
    of local exchange properly and show initiative, we shall obtain extra
    poods of grain.
Comrade Gusev has handed me a draft of the rules and regulations for a
    Communist Producers’ Co-operative Society. Its substance is contained
    in Point 5, in which the members of the society ask to be assured a
    “healthy, hygienic ration". (Laughter.) A “healthy,
    hygienic ration” is the goal of our whole food policy. We must
    collect 240 million poods of grain by means of the tax, and 160
    million through commodity exchange, making a total of 400 million
    poods, so that the peasants may feel that this system is
    economically stable.
The surplus-grain appropriation system could not be continued any
    longer. The policy had to be changed. In this respect, we are facing what
    is, perhaps, the most difficult period of our construction effort. If we
    were to compare the whole work of the Communist Party to a four-year course
    in the higher sciences, we could say that our present position is as
    follows: we are taking our examination to pass from the third course to the
    fourth; we have not yet passed the examination, but there is every sign
    that we shall. We can say that the first course lasted from the 1870s to
    1903; it was the initial introductory period, ranging from Narodnaya Volya,
    Social-Democracy and the Second International to Bolshevism. That was the
    first course.
The second course lasted from 1903 to 1917, with a serious preparatory
    course for revolution, and the first essay in revolution in 1905. The third
    course lasted from 1917 to 1921, a period of four years, which in content
    was more important than the first forty years. This was a very practical
    test, when the proletariat came to power, but it was not yet the crucial
    test. Although in our anthem we sing: “The last fight let us face", I
    must say that, unfortunately, it was not the last fight, but one of the
    fights just before the last, to be absolutely exact. At present we are
    taking our examination to pass from the third course to the fourth. Taking
    Osinsky’s example of years, I think we should allow ten, because we
    shall have to take an exam to pass from the third course to the fourth.
    After that we must do well in the fourth course and then we shall really be
    invincible. We can win on the economic front. If we are victorious in
    relation to the peasantry and collect a “healthy, hygienic
    ration” this year, we shall pass to the fourth course. After that,
    all the work of construction that we are planning will be more serious.
This is the task confronting us. That is why I take the liberty, once
    again, in conclusion to express the hope that, in spite of the
    difficulties, and all the old traditions which frown on the idea of
    discussing local questions of minor economics at congresses, conferences
    and fine parliamentary assemblies, we shall, nevertheless, say to
    ourselves: being Communists, we shall have to devote ourselves to these
    tasks. We must study the practical experience gained in economic work in
    the localities, where the decrees are being applied, where they are tested,
    where their defects should be rectified, where we must begin to do the
    things that are later summed up at our meetings. If we do that, our work of
    construction will make real and durable progress. (Stormy
    applause.)
4. Draft Resolution On Questions Of The New Economic
    Policy
1. The fundamental political task of the moment is for all Party and
    Soviet workers to gain a complete understanding of the New Economic Policy
    and to implement it to the letter.
The Party regards this policy as being established for a long period of
    years, and demands that everyone should carry it out unconditionally with
    thoroughness and diligence.
2. Commodity exchange is brought to the fore as the principal lever of
    the New Economic Policy. It is impossible to establish a correct
    relationship between the proletariat and the peasantry, or an altogether
    stable form of economic alliance between these two classes in the period of
    transition from capitalism to socialism, without regular commodity exchange
    or the exchange of products between industry and agriculture.
The exchange of commodities, in particular, is required to stimulate the
    extension of the peasants’ area under crop and improvement of peasant
    farming.
Local initiative and enterprise must be given all-round support and
    development at all costs.
gubernias with the greatest grain surpluses must be placed on
    the priority list for commodity exchange.
3. Considering co-operatives to be the main apparatus for commodity
    exchange, the conference recognises as correct the policy of contracts
    between the agencies of the People’s Commissariat for Food and the
    co-operative societies, and the transfer, under government control, by the
    former to the latter of commodity-exchange stocks to fulfil the assignments
    of the government;
the co-operatives to be given broad opportunities for procurement and
    all-round development of local industry and revival of economic life in
    general;
support for credit operations by the co-operatives;
anarchic commodity exchange (that is, exchange which eludes all control
    and state supervision) to be combated by concentration of exchange chiefly
    in the hands of the co-operatives, without, however, any restrictions on
    regular free market operations;
market analysis.
4. Support for small and medium (private and co operative) enterprises,
    chiefly those not requiring supplies from state raw material, fuel and food
    reserves.
Permission to lease government enterprises to private persons,
    co-operatives, artels and associations. The right of local economic
    agencies to conclude such contracts without authorisation from superior
    agencies. Obligatory notification of the Council of Labour and Defence in
    each such case.
5. Review of (certain sections of) production programmes for large-scale
    industry towards increasing the manufacture of consumer goods and peasant
    household articles.
Extension of enterprise and initiative by each large establishment in
    the disposal of financial and material resources. Submission of a precise
    decree to that effect for approval by the Council of People’s
    Commissars.
6. Development of the system of bonuses in kind and the establishment by
    way of experiment of a collective supply system.
Establishment of a more correct distribution of foodstuffs with the aim
    of increasing labour productivity.
7. The need to maintain and enlarge the apparatus for the full and
    expeditious collection of the tax in kind everywhere. Investment of food
    agencies with the necessary Party authority for that purpose. Maintenance
    and enhancement of the centralisation of the food apparatus.
8. To concentrate all the enumerated measures on the current
    year’s practical and urgent task: collection of at least 400 million
    poods of grain stocks as a basis for the rehabilitation of
    large-scale industry and the implementation of the electriccation plan.
9. To adopt in principle the draft Instructions of the C.L.D.,
    authorising the All-Russia Central Executive Committee group to enact them
    into law.
To recognise the strict fulfilment of the Instructions in general and
    the recruitment and promotion of non-Party people for work, in particular,
    as the Party’s unconditional and primary task.
10. To establish special responsibility on the part of central agencies
    for any hampering of local initiative and insufficient support of it. To
    authorise the All-Russia Central Executive Committee group to work out a
    corresponding decision and have it adopted at the very next session.
11. The conference authorises the Central Committee and all Party
    organisations to carry out a system of measures to intensify agitation and
    propaganda and effect the necessary transfer of Party cadres to ensure
    complete understanding and steady implementation of the enumerated
    tasks.
12. To set as the Party’s most important task the careful and
    all-round publicising and study in the press and at trade union, Soviet,
    and Party meetings, conferences, congresses, etc., of the practical
    experience gained in economic development locally and at the centre.

5. Speech In Closing The Conference May 28
Comrades, I think that I can confine myself to a very short speech. As
    you are aware, we convened this special conference mainly for the purpose
    of achieving complete understanding on economic policy between the centre
    and the localities, among Party and all Soviet workers. I think that the
    conference has fully achieved its object. Some speakers noted that Comrade
    Osinsky gave the correct expression to the feelings of very many, probably,
    the majority of local Party workers when he said that we must remove all
    doubt about the fact that the policy adopted by the Tenth Party Congress
    and subsequently reinforced by decrees and orders has unquestionably been
    accepted by the Party in earnest and for a long time. This is what the
    conference most emphatically expressed and amplified by a number of points.
    When the comrades return to their localities, not the slightest possibility
    of wrong interpretation will remain. Of course, in adopting a policy to be
    pursued over a number of years we do not for a moment forget that
    everything may be altered by the international revolution, its rate of
    development and the circumstances accompanying it. The current
    international situation is such that some sort of a temporary, unstable
    equilibrium, but equilibrium for all that, has been established; it is the
    kind of equilibrium under which the imperialist powers have been compelled
    to abandon their desire to hurl themselves at Soviet Russia, despite their
    hatred for her, because the disintegration of the capitalist world is
    steadily progressing, unity is steadily diminishing, while the onslaught of
    the forces of the oppressed colonies, which have a population of over a
    thousand million, is increasing from year to year, month to month, and even
    week to week. But we can make no conjectures on this score. We are now
    exercising our main influence on the international revolution through our
    economic policy. The working people of all countries without exception and
    without exaggeration are looking to the Soviet Russian Republic. This much
    has been achieved. The capitalists cannot hush up or conceal anything. That
    is why they so eagerly catch at our every economic mistake and weakness.
    The struggle in this field has now become global. Once we solve this
    problem, we shall have certainly and finally won on an international scale.
    That is why for us questions of economic development become of absolutely
    exceptional importance. On this front, we must achieve victory by a steady
    rise and progress which must be gradual and necessarily slow. I think that
    as a result of the work of our conference we shall certainly achieve this
    goal. (Applause.)

Endnotes
[1] An
    extraordinary conference, held in Moscow from May 26 to 28, 1921, was
    attended by 239 delegates from Party and Soviet organisations. On its
    agenda were the following questions: 1) Economic policy: a) tax in kind; b)
    co-operatives; c) financial reform; d) small industry; 2) The current role
    of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, 3) The Third Congress of
    the Comintern; 4) Information on the Fourth Trade Union Congress; 5)
    Organisational question.
The Conference centred on the question of the New
    Economic Policy (NEP) because it was not yet clear enough to the people in
    the localities.
Lenin guided the work of the Conference: he delivered
    the opening speech, spoke on the agenda, was elected to the Presidium, gave
    a report and a summing-up speech on the tax in kind, and the closing speech
    of the Conference. Substantiating the New Economic Policy, he exposed the
    false rumours about NEP and distortions of this policy, and stressed that
    it was a policy whose aim was the construction of a socialist society, that
    it was to be carried out “in earnest and for a long time". The
    Conference adopted Lenin’s draft resolution, “On Economic
    Policy", which confirmed NEP’s basic principles and gave concrete
    instructions for their implementation. It said: “The basic political
    task of the moment is for all Party and Soviet workers to master and
    implement to the letter the New Economic Policy. See K.P.S.S. v
    rezolutsiakh . . . (The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions
    of Congresses, Conferences and C.C. Plenary Meetings, Part 1,
    1954, p. 574).
After the Conference had heard information on the work
    of the Fourth Trade Union Congress, Lenin sharply criticised the factional
    activity of the trade union leadership, first and foremost M. P. Tomsky,
    Chairman of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions.
Another question of great importance was the
    organisational work of the Party, the report on which was given by V. M.
    Molotov. The Conference adopted a “Plan for the Work of the Central
    Committee of the R.C.P.(B.)” which demanded the training and
    promotion of new Party workers and activisation of all Party and Soviet
    work. Lenin stressed that Party organisations had to establish closer ties
    with the non-Party masses and that it was necessary to collect and study
    the experience of local Party organisations. His remarks were taken into
    account in the resolution.
Representatives of the Communist Parties of Germany and
    the United States conveyed greetings to the Conference, and, on the motion
    of the Presidium, the Conference cabled a message of greetings to workers
    detained in prison.
[2] The
    reference is to the Fourth All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions, held in
    Moscow from May 17 to 25, 1921, and the Fourth All-Russia Congress of
    Economic Councils, held there from May 18 to 24, 1921.
The Fourth Congress of Trade Unions had the following
    items on its agenda: report of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade
    Unions; report of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council the role
    and tasks of the trade unions and economic development organisational
    question; wage-rate policy and workers’ supply; trade unions and
    co-operatives; labour protection, etc.
The Fourth Congress of Economic Councils had on its
    agenda: report of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council, economic
    policy of the S.E.C. in connection with the decree on the tax in kind and
    the co-operatives, S.E.C. organisation, report of the State Planning
    Commission; report on foreign trade; electrification of Russia; material
    resources of the Republic and organisation of supply in industry.
The most important questions were discussed at joint
    sittings of the two congresses with the participation of specialists and
    public figures.
[3] Colonel of
    the gendarmerie Zubatov, Chief of the Secret Political Police, proposed the
    setting up of legal workers’ organisations in 1901-03 to divert the
    workers from political struggle against the tsarist autocracy, and to
    switch their attention to narrow economic demands which the government, he
    asserted, was ready to meet. The Minister for the Interior, V. K. Plehve,
    approved Zubatov’s activity and the first organisation, called
    “Workers’ mutual aid in mechanical industries society", was set
    up in Moscow in May 1901, and later such societies made their appearance in
    Minsk, Odessa, Vilno, Kiev, and other towns.
The Second Coneress of the R.S.D.L.P., in its resolution
    “On the Trade Union Struggle", defined Zubatovism as a policy of
    “systematic betrayal of working class interests for the benefit of
    the capitalists", and in order to fight it, called on Party organisations
    to support and lead any strikes started by legal workers’
    organisations.
Revolutionary Social-Democrats made use of such
    organisations to draw the masses of working people into the struggle
    against the tsarist government, exposing the reactionary nature of
    Zubatov’s policy. Lenin wrote in 1905: “And now the Zubatov
    movement is outgrowing its bounds. Initiated by the police in the interests
    of the police, in the interests of supporting the autocracy and
    demoralising the political consciousness of the workers, this movement is
    turning against the autocracy and is becoming an outbreak of the
    proletarian class struggle.”
The tsarist government had to close down the Zubatov
    organisations in 1903 because of the mounting revolutionary movement.
Lenin believed it was highly important to give the
    working people a thorough explanation of these Instructions and put them
    into practice as soon as possible.

1 Theses For A Report On The Tactics Of The R.C.P.
 1. The International Position Of The R.S.F.S.R.
    

      The international position of the R.S.F.S.R. at present is
      distinguished by a certain equilibrium, which, although
      extremely unstable, has nevertheless given rise to a peculiar
      state of affairs in world politics.

      This peculiarity is the following. On the one hand, the
      international bourgeoisie is filled with furious hatred of, and
      hostility towards, Soviet Russia, and is prepared at any moment
      to fling itself upon her in order to strangle her. On the other
      hand, all attempts at military intervention, which have cost the
      international bourgeoisie hundreds of millions of francs, ended
      in complete failure, in spite of the fact that the Soviet power
      was then weaker than it is now and that the Russian landowners
      and capitalists had whole armies on the territory of the
      R.S.F.S.R. Opposition to the war against Soviet Russia has grown
      considerably in all capitalist countries, adding fuel to the
      revolutionary movement of the proletariat and extending to very
      wide sections of the petty-bourgeois democrats. The conflict of
      interests between the various imperialist countries has become
      acute, and is growing more acute every day. The revolutionary
      movement among the hundreds of millions of oppressed peoples of
      the East is growing with remarkable vigour. The result of all
      these conditions is that international imperialism has proved
      unable to strangle Soviet Russia, although it is far stronger,
      and has been obliged for the time being to grant her
      recognition, or semi-recognition, and to conclude trade
      agreements with her.

      The result is a state of equilibrium which, although highly
      unstable and precarious, enables the Socialist Republic to
      exist—not for long, of course—within the capitalist
      encirclement.

  2. The International Alignment Of Class Forces
    

      This state of affairs has given rise to the following
      international alignment of class forces.

      The international bourgeoisie, deprived of the opportunity of
      waging open war against Soviet Russia, is waiting and watching
      for the moment when circumstances will permit it to resume the
      war.

      The proletariat in all the advanced capitalist countries has
      already formed its vanguard, the Communist Parties, which are
      growing, making steady progress towards winning the majority of
      the proletariat in each country, and destroying the influence of
      the old trade union bureaucrats and of the upper stratum of the
      working class of America and Europe, which has been corrupted by
      imperialist privileges.

      The petty-bourgeois democrats in the capitalist countries, whose
      foremost sections are represented by the Second and
      Two-and-a-Half Internationals, serve today as the mainstay of
      capitalism, since they retain an influence over the majority, or
      a considerable section, of the industrial and commercial workers
      and office employees who are afraid that if revolution breaks
      out they will lose the relative petty-bourgeois prosperity
      created by the privileges of imperialism. But the growing
      economic crisis is worsening the condition of broad sections of
      the people everywhere, and this, with the looming inevitability
      of new imperialist wars if capitalism is preserved, is steadily
      weakening this mainstay.

      The masses of the working people in the colonial and semi
      colonial countries, who constitute the overwhelming majority of
      the population of the globe, were roused to political life at
      the turn of the twentieth century, particularly by the
      revolutions in Russia, Turkey, Persia and China. The imperialist
      war of 1914-18 and the Soviet power in Russia are completing the
      process of converting these masses into an active factor in
      world politics and in the revolutionary destruction of
      imperialism, although the educated philistines of Europe and
      America, including the leaders of the Second and Two-and-a-Half
      Internationals, stubbornly refuse to see this. British India is
      at the head of these countries, and there revolution is maturing
      in proportion, on the one hand, to the growth of the industrial
      and railway proletariat, and, on the other, to the increase in
      the brutal terrorism of the British,  who with ever greater
      frequency resort to massacres (Amritsar),[2] public
      floggings, etc.

      3. The Alignment Of Class Forces In Russia

      The internal political situation in Soviet Russia is determined
      by the fact that here, for the first time in history, there have
      been, for a number of years, only two classes—the
      proletariat, trained for decades by a very young, but modern,
      large-scale machine industry, and the small peasantry, who
      constitute the overwhelming majority of the population.

      In Russia, the big landowners and capitalists have not vanished,
      but they have been subjected to total expropriation and crushed
      politically as a class, whose remnants are hiding out among
      Soviet government employees. They have preserved their class
      organisation abroad, as émigrés, numbering probably
      from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000 people, with over 50 daily
      newspapers of all bourgeois and “socialist” (i.e.,
      petty-bourgeois) parties, the remnants of an army, and numerous
      connections with the international bourgeoisie. These
      émigrés are striving, with might and main, to destroy
      the Soviet power and restore capitalism in Russia.

      4. The Proletariat And The Peasantry In Russia

      This being the internal situation in Russia, the main task now
      confronting her proletariat, as the ruling class, is properly to
      determine and carry out the measures that are necessary to lead
      the peasantry, establish a firm alliance with them and achieve
      the transition, in a series of gradual stages, to large-scale,
      socialised, mechanised agriculture. This is a particularly
      difficult task in Russia, both because of her backwardness, and
      her extreme state of ruin as a 

      result of seven years of imperialist and civil war. But apart
      from these specific circumstances, this is one of the most
      difficult tasks of socialist construction that will confront all
      capitalist countries, with, perhaps, the sole exception of
      Britain. However, even in regard to Britain it must not be
      forgotten that, while the small tenant farmers there constitute
      only a very small class, the percentage of workers and office
      employees who enjoy a petty-bourgeois standard of living is
      exceptionally high, due to the actual enslavement of hundreds of
      millions of people in Britain’s colonial possessions.

      Hence, from the standpoint of development of the world
      proletarian revolution as a single process, the epoch Russia is
      passing through is significant as a practical test and a
      verification of the policy of a proletariat in power towards the
      mass of the petty bourgeoisie.

      5. The Military Alliance Between The Proletariat
  And The Peasantry In The R.S.F.S.R.

      The basis for proper relations between the proletariat and the
      peasantry in Soviet Russia was created in the period of 1917-21
      when the invasion of the capitalists and landowners, supported
      by the whole world bourgeoisie and all the petty-bourgeois
      democratic parties (Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks),
      caused the proletariat and the peasantry to form, sign and seal
      a military alliance to defend the Soviet power. Civil war is the
      most intense form of class struggle, but the more intense it is,
      the more rapidly its flames consume all petty-bourgeois
      illusions and prejudices, and the more clearly experience proves
      even to the most backward strata of the peasantry that only the
      dictatorship of the proletariat can save it, and that the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks are in fact merely the
      servants of the landowners and capitalists.

      But while the military alliance between the proletariat and the
      peasantry was—and had perforce to be—the primary
      form of their firm alliance, it could not have been maintained
      even for a few weeks without an economic alliance between the
      two classes. The peasants received from the workers’ state
      all the land and were given protection against the landowners
      and the kulaks; the workers have been receiving from the
      peasants loans of food supplies until large-scale industry is
      restored.

      6. The Transition To Proper Economic Relations
 Between The Proletariat And The Peasantry

      The alliance between the small peasants and the proletariat can
      become a correct and stable one from the socialist standpoint
      only when the complete restoration of transport and large-scale
      industry enables the proletariat to give the peasants, in
      exchange for food, all the goods they need for their own use and
      for the improvement of their farms. With the country in ruins,
      this could not possibly be achieved at once. The surplus
      appropriation system was the best measure available to the
      insufficiently organised state to maintain itself in the
      incredibly arduous war against the landowners. The crop failure
      and the fodder shortage in 1920 particularly increased the
      hardships of the peasantry, already severe enough, and made the
      immediate transition to the tax in kind imperative.

      The moderate tax in kind will bring about a big improvement in
      the condition of the peasantry at once, and will at the same
      time stimulate them to enlarge crop areas and improve farming
      methods.

      The tax in kind signifies a transition from the requisition of
      all the peasants’ surplus grain to regular socialist
      exchange of products between industry and agriculture.

      7. The Conditions Under Which The Soviet Government Can
         Permit Capitalism And Concessions, And The Significance
         Thereof

      Naturally, the tax in kind means freedom for the peasant to
      dispose of his after-tax surplus at his own discretion. Since
      the state cannot provide the peasant with goods from socialist
      factories in exchange for all his surplus, freedom to trade with
      this surplus necessarily means freedom for the development of
      capitalism.

      Within the limits indicated, however, this is not at all
      dangerous for socialism as long as transport and large-scale
      industry remain in the hands of the proletariat. On the
      contrary, the development of capitalism, controlled and
      regulated by the proletarian state (i.e., “state”
      capitalism in this sense of the term), is advantageous
      and necessary in an extremely devastated and backward
      small-peasant country (within certain limits, of course),
      inasmuch as it is capable of hastening the immediate
      revival of peasant farming. This applies still more to
      concessions: without denationalising anything, the
      workers’ state leases certain mines, forest tracts,
      oilfields, and so forth, to foreign capitalists in order to
      obtain from them extra equipment and machinery that will enable
      us to accelerate the restoration of Soviet large-scale
      industry.

      The payment made to the concessionaires in the form of a share
      of the highly valuable products obtained is undoubtedly tribute,
      which the workers’ state pays to the world bourgeoisie;
      without in any way glossing this over, we must clearly realise
      that we stand to gain by paying this tribute, so long as it
      accelerates the restoration of our large-scale industry and
      substantially improves the condition of the workers and
      peasants.

      8. The Success Of Our Food Policy

      The food policy pursued by Soviet Russia in 1917-21 was
      undoubtedly very crude and imperfect, and gave rise to many
      abuses. A number of mistakes were made in its
      implementation. But as a whole, it was the only possible policy
      under the conditions prevailing at the time. And it did fulfil
      its historic mission: it saved the proletarian dictatorship in a
      ruined and backward country. There can be no doubt that it has
      gradually improved. In the first year that we had full power
      (August 1, 1918 to August 1, 1919) the state collected 110
      million poods of grain; in the second year it collected
      220 million poods, and in the third year—over 285
      million poods.

      Now, having acquired practical experience, we have set out, and
      expect, to collect 400 million poods (the tax in kind
      is expected to bring in 240 million poods). Only when
      it is actually in possession of an adequate stock of food will
      the workers’ state be able to stand firmly on its own feet
      economically, secure the, steady, if slow, restoration of
      large-scale industry, and create a proper financial system.

      
 9. The Material Basis Of Socialism And The Plan
 For The Electrification Of Russia

      A large-scale machine industry capable of reorganising
      agriculture is the only material basis that is possible for
      socialism. But we cannot confine ourselves to this general
      thesis. It must be made more concrete. Large-scale industry
      based on the latest achievements of technology and capable of
      reorganising agriculture implies the electrification of the
      whole country. We had to undertake the scientific work of
      drawing up such a plan for the electrification of the
      R.S.F.S.R. and we have accomplished it. With the co-operation of
      over two hundred of the best scientists, engineers and
      agronomists in Russia, this work has now been completed; it was
      published in a large volume and, as a whole, endorsed by the
      Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets in December
      1920. Arrangements have now been made to convene an all-Russia
      congress of electrical engineers in August 1921 to examine this
      plan in detail, before it is given final government
      endorsement. The execution of the first part of the
      electrification scheme is estimated to take ten years, and will
      require about 370 million man-days.

      In 1918, we had eight newly erected power stations (with a total
      capacity of 4,757 kw); in 1919, the figure rose to 36 (total
      capacity of 1,648 kw), and in 1920, it rose to 100 (total
      capacity of 8,699 kw).

      Modest as this beginning is for our vast country, a start has
      been made, work has begun and is making steady progress. After
      the imperialist war, after a million prisoners of war in Germany
      had become familiar with modern up-to-date technique, after the
      stern but hardening experience of three years of civil war, the
      Russian peasant is a different man. With every passing month he
      sees more clearly and more vividly that only the guidance given
      by the proletariat is capable of leading the mass of small
      farmers out of capitalist slavery to socialism.

      10. The Role Of “Pure Democracy”, The Second 
      And Two-And-A-Half Internationals, 
      The Socialist-Revolutionaries And The Mensheviks As The
      Allies Of Capital


      The dictatorship of the proletariat does not signify a
      cessation of the class struggle, but its continuation in a
      new form and with new weapons. This dictatorship is
      essential as long as classes exist, as long as the
      bourgeoisie, overthrown in one country, intensifies tenfold
      its attacks on socialism on an international scale. In the
      transition period, the small farmer class is bound to
      experience certain vacillations. The difficulties of
  transition, and the influence of the bourgeoisie, inevitably
      cause the mood of this mass to change from time to
      time. Upon the proletariat, enfeebled and to a certain
      extent declassed by the destruction of the large-scale
      machine industry, which is its vital foundation, devolves
      the very difficult but paramount historic task of holding
      out in spite of these vacillations, and of carrying to
      victory its cause of emancipating labour from the yoke of
      capital.

      The policy pursued-by the petty-bourgeois democratic
      parties, i.e., the parties affiliated to the Second and
  Two-and-a-Half Internationals, represented in Russia by the
  S.R. (Socialist-Revolutionary) and Menshevik parties, is the
  political expression of the vacillations of the petty
  bourgeoisie. These parties now have their headquarters and
  newspapers abroad, and are actually in a bloc with the whole
  of the bourgeois counter-revolution and are serving it
  loyally.

  The shrewd leaders of the Russian big bourgeoisie headed by
  Milyukov, the leader of the Cadet (Constitutional
  Democratic) Party, have quite clearly, definitely and openly
  appraised this role of the petty-bourgeois democrats, i.e.,
  the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. In connection
  with the Kronstadt mutiny, in which the Mensheviks,
  Socialist-Revolutionaries and whiteguards, joined forces,
  Milyukov declared in favour of the “Soviets without
  the Bolsheviks” slogan. Elaborating on the idea, he
  wrote that the Socialist-Revolutionaries  and Mensheviks
  “are welcome to try” (Pravda No. 64,
  1921, quoted from the Paris Posledniye Novosti [3]), because upon them devolves the
  task of first taking power away from the
  Bolsheviks. Milyukov, the leader of the big bourgeoisie, has
  correctly appraised the lesson taught by all revolutions,
  namely, that the petty-bourgeois democrats are incapable of
  holding power, and always serve merely as a screen for the
  dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and a stepping stone to its
  undivided power.

  The proletarian revolution in Russia again and again
  confirms this lesson of 1789-94 and 1848-49, and also what
  Frederick Engels said in his letter to Bebel of December 11,
  1884.

  . . .“Pure democracy . . . when the moment of
  revolution comes, acquires a temporary importance . . . as
  the final sheet-anchor of the whole bourgeois and even
  feudal economy. . . . Thus between March and September 1848
  the whole feudal-bureaucratic mass strengthened the liberals
  in order to hold down the revolutionary masses. . . . In any
  case our sole adversary on the day of the crisis and on the
  day after the crisis will be the whole of the reaction which
  will group around pure democracy, and this,  I think, should
  not be lost sight of.” (Published in Russian in
  Kommunistichesky Trud[4] No. 360, June
  9, 1921, in an article by Comrade V. Adoratsky: “Marx
  and Engels on Democracy”. In German, published in the
  book, Friedrich Engels, Politisches
  Vermächtnis, Internationale Jugend-Bibliothek,
  Nr. 12, Berlin, 1920, S. 19.)

  2. 
  Speech On The Italian Question
 June 28

  Comrades, I should like to reply mainly to Comrade
  Lazzari. He said: “Quote concrete facts, not
  words.” Excellent. But if we trace the development of
  the reformist opportunist trend in Italy, what will that be,
  words or facts? In your speeches and in the whole of your
  policy you lose sight of the fact, which is so important for
  the socialist movement in Italy, that not only this trend,
  but an opportunist reformist group has existed for quite a
  long time. I still very well remember the time when
  Bernstein started his opportunist propaganda, which ended in
  social-patriotism, in the treason and bankruptcy of the
  Second International. We have known Turati ever since, not
  only by name, but for his propaganda in the Italian party
  and in the Italian working-class movement, of which he has
  been a disrupter for the past twenty years. Lack of time
  prevents me from closely studying the material concerning
  the Italian party; but I think that one of the most
  important documents on this subject is a report, published
  in a bourgeois Italian newspaper—I don’t
  remember which,  La Stampa[5] or Corriere
  della Sera[6]—of the conference held by
  Turati and his friends in Reggio Emilia.[7] I compared that report with the
  one published in Avanti![8] Is this not
  proof enough? After the Second Congress of the Communist
  International, we, in our controversy with Serrati and his
  friends, openly and definitely told them what, in our
  opinion, the situation was. We told them that the Italian
  party could not become a Communist Party as long as it
  tolerated people like Turati in its ranks.

  What is this, political facts, or again just words? After
  the Second Congress of the Communist International we openly
  said to the Italian proletariat: “Don’t unite
  with the reformists, with Turati.” Serrati launched a
  series of articles in the Italian press in opposition to the
  Communist  International and convened a special conference
  of reformists.[9] Was all this mere words? It was
  something more than a split: it was the creation of a new
  party. One must have been blind not to have seen this. This
  document is of decisive importance for this question. All
  those who attended the Reggio Emilia conference must be
  expelled from the party; they are Mensheviks—not
  Russian, but Italian Mensheviks. Lazzari said: “We
  know the Italian people’s mentality.” For my
  part I would not dare to make such an assertion about the
  Russian people, but that is not important. “Italian
  Socialists understand the spirit of the Italian people very
  well,” said Lazzari. Perhaps they do, I will not argue
  about that. But they do not know Italian Menshevism, if the
  concrete facts and the persistent refusal to eradicate
  Menshevism is anything to go by. We are obliged to say
  that—deplorable though it may be—the resolution
  of our Executive Committee must be confirmed. A party which
  tolerates opportunists and reformists like Turati in its
  ranks cannot be affiliated to the Communist
  International.

  “Why should we change the name of the party?”
  asks Comrade Lazzari. “The present one is quite
  satisfactory.” But we cannot share this view. We know
  the history of the Second International, its fall and
  bankruptcy. Do we not know the history of the German party?
  And do we not know that the great misfortune of the
  working-class movement in Germany is that the break was not
  brought about before the war? This cost the lives of twenty
  thousand workers, whom the Scheidemannists and the Centrists
  betrayed to the German Government by their polemics with and
  complaints against the German Communists.[10]

  And do we not now see the same thing in Italy? The Italian
  party was never a truly revolutionary party. Its great
  misfortune is that it did not break with the Mensheviks and
  reformists before the war, and that the latter continued to
  remain in the party. Comrade Lazzari says: “We fully
  recognise the necessity of a break with the reformists; our
  only disagreement is that we did not think it necessary to
  bring it about at the Leghorn Congress.” But the facts
  tell a different story. This is not the first time that we
  are discussing Italian reformism. In arguing about this with
  Serrati last year, we said: “You won’t mind us
  asking why the split in the Italian party cannot be brought
  about immediately, why it must be postponed?” What did
  Serrati say in reply to that? Nothing. And Comrade Lazzari,
  quoting an article by Frossard in which the latter said,
  “We must be adroit and clever”, evidently thinks
  that this is an argument in his favour and against us. I
  think he is mistaken. On the contrary, it is an excellent
  argument in our favour and against Comrade Lazzari. What
  will the Italian workers say when you are obliged to explain
  your conduct and your resignation? What will you tell them
  if they declare our tactics to be clever and adroit compared
  with the zigzags of the pseudo-Communist Left—the Left
  which at times is not even simply Communist and more often
  looks like anarchism?

  What is the meaning of the tales told by Serrati and his
  party about the Russians only wanting everyone to imitate
  them? We want the very opposite. It takes more than
  memorising communist resolutions and using revolutionary
  phrases on every possible occasion. That is not enough, and
  we are opposed beforehand to Communists who know this or
  that resolution by heart. The mark of true communism is a
  break with opportunism. We shall be quite frank and open
  with those Communists who subscribe to this and, boldly, in
  the conviction that we are right, will tell them:
  “Don’t do anything stupid; be clever and
  skilful.” But we shali speak in this way only with
  Communists who have broken with the opportunists, something
  that cannot yet be said about you. I repeat therefore: I
  hope the Congress will confirm the resolution of the
  Executive Committee. Comrade Lazzari said: “We are in
  the preparatory period.” This is absolutely true. You
  are in the preparatory period. The first stage of this
  period is a break with the Mensheviks, similar to the one we
  brought about with our Mensheviks in 1903. The sufferings
  the whole of the German working class has had to endure
  during this long and weary post-war period in the history of
  the German revolution are due to the fact that the German
  party did not break with the Mensheviks.

  Comrade Lazzari said that the Italian party is passing
  through the preparatory period. This I fully accept. And the
  first stage is a definite, final, unambiguous and determined
  break with reformism. When that is brought about the masses
  will side solidly with communism. The second stage is by no
  means a repetition of revolutionary slogans. It will be the
  adoption of our wise and skilful decisions, which will
  always be such, and which will always say: fundamental
  revolutionary principles must be adapted to the specific
  conditions in the various countries.

  The revolution in Italy will run a different course from
  that in Russia. It will start in a different way. How?
  Neither you nor we know. The Italian Communists are not
  always Communists to a sufficient degree. Did a single
  Communist  show his mettle when the workers seized the
  factories in Italy?[11]] No. At that
  time, there was as yet no communism in Italy; there was a
  certain amount of anarchism, but no Marxian communism. The
  latter has still to be created and the masses of the workers
  must be imbued with it by means of the experience of the
  revolutionary struggle. And the first step along this road
  is a final break with the Mensheviks, who for more than
  twenty years have been collaborating and working with the
  bourgeois government. It is quite Probable that Modigliani,
  whom I was able to watch to some extent at the Zimmerwald
  and Kienthal conferences, is a sufficiently astute
  politician to keep out of the bourgeois government and to
  keep in the centre of the Socialist Party, where he can be
  far more useful to the bourgeoisie. But all the theories of
  Turati and his friends, all their propaganda and agitation,
  signify collaboration with the bourgeoisie. Is this not
  proved by the numerous quotations in Gennari’s speech?
  Indeed, it is the united front which Turati has already
  prepared. That is why I must say to Comrade Lazzari:
  “Speeches like yours and like the one which Comrade
  Serrati made here do not help to prepare for the revolution,
  they disorganise it. “ (Shouts :
  “Bravo!” Applause.)

  You had a considerable majority at Leghorn. You had 98,000
  votes against 14,000 reformist and 58,000 communist
  votes. As the beginning of a purely communist movement in a
  country like Italy, with its well-known traditions, where
  the ground has not been sufficiently prepared for a split,
  this vote is a considerable achievement for the
  Communists.

  This is a great victory and tangible proof of the fact that
  the working-class movement in Italy will develop faster than
  our movement developed in Russia, because, if you are
  familiar with the figures concerning our movement, you must
  know that in February 1917, after the fall of tsarism and
  during the bourgeois republic, we were still a minority
  compared with the Mensheviks. Such was the position after
  fifteen years of fierce fighting and splits. Our Right wing
  did not grow—and it was not so easy to prevent it from
  growing, as you seem to think when you speak of Russia in
  such a disparaging tone. Undoubtedly, development in Italy
  will proceed quite differently. After fifteen years of
  struggle against the Mensheviks, and after the fall of
  tsarism, we started work with a much smaller number of
  adherents. You have 58,000 communistically minded workers
  against 98,000 united Centrists who occupy an indefinite
  position. This is proof, this is a fact, which should
  certainly convince all those who refuse to close their eyes
  to the mass movement of the Italian workers. Nothing comes
  all at once. But it certainly proves that the mass of
  workers—not the old leaders, the bureaucrats, the
  professors, the journalists, but the class that is actually
  exploited, the vanguard of the exploited—supports
  us. And it proves what a great mistake you made at
  Leghorn. This is a fact. You controlled 98,000 votes, but
  you preferred to go with 14,000 reformists against 58,000
  Communists. You should have gone with them even if they were
  not genuine Communists, even if they were only adherents of
  Bordiga—which is not true, for after the Second
  Congress Bordiga quite honestly declared that he had
  abandoned all anarchism and anti-parliamentarism. But what
  did you do? You chose to unite with 14,000 reformists and to
  break with 58,000 Communists. And this is the best proof
  that Serrati’s policy has been disastrous for
  Italy. We never wanted Serrati in Italy to copy the Russian
  revolution. That would have been stupid. We are intelligent
  and flexible enough to avoid such stupidity. But Serrati has
  proved that his policy in Italy was wrong. Perhaps he should
  have manoeuvred. This is the expression that he repeated
  most often when he was here last year. He said: “We
  know how to manoeuvre, we do not want slavish
  imitation. That would be idiocy. We must manoeuvre, so as to
  bring about a separation from opportunism. You Russians do
  not know how to do that. We Italians are more skilful at
  that sort of thing. That remains to be seen.” And what
  is it we saw? Serrati executed a brilliant manoeuvre. He
  broke away from 58,000 Communists. And now these comrades
  come here and say: “If you reject us the masses will
  be confused.” No, comrades, you are mistaken. The
  masses of the workers in Italy are confused now, and it will
  do them good if we tell them: “Comrades, you must
  choose; Italian workers, you must choose between the
  Communist International, which will never call upon you
  slavishly to imitate the Russians, and the Mensheviks, whom
  we have known for twenty years, and whom we shall never
  tolerate as neighbours in a genuinely revolutionary
  Communist International.” That is what we shall say to
  the Italian workers. There can be no doubt about the
  result. The masses of workers will follow us. (Loud
  approval.)

  Speech In Defence Of The Tactics Of The Communist International
  July 1

  Comrades! I deeply regret that I must confine myself to
  self-defence. (Laughter.) I say deeply regret,
  because after acquainting myself with Comrade
  Terracini’s speech and the amendments introduced by
  three delegations, I should very much like to take the
  offensive, for, properly speaking, offensive operations are
  essential against the views  defended by Terracini and these
  three delegations.[12] If the Congress is not going to
  wage a vigorous offensive against such errors, against such
  “Leftist” stupidities, the whole movement is
  doomed. That is my deep conviction. But we are organised and
  disciplined Marxists. We cannot be satisfied with speeches
  against individual comrades. We Russians are already sick
  and tired of these Leftist phrases. We are men of
  organisation. In drawing up our plans, we must proceed in an
  organised way and try to find the correct line. It is, of
  course, no secret that our theses are a compromise. And why
  not? Among Communists, who have already convened their Third
  Congress and have worked out definite fundamental
  principles, compromises under certain conditions are
  necessary. Our theses, put forward by the Russian
  delegation, were studied and prepared in the most careful
  way and were the result of long arguments and meetings with
  various delegations. They aim at establishing the basic line
  of the Communist International and are especially necessary
  now after we have not only formally condemned the real
  Centrists but have expelled them from the Party. Such are
  the facts. I have to stand up for these theses. Now, when
  Terracini comes forward and says that we must continue the
  fight against the Centrists, and goes on to tell how it is
  intended to wage the fight, I say that if these amendments
  denote a definite trend, a relentless fight against this
  trend is essential, for otherwise there is no communism and
  no Communist International. I am surprised that the German
  Communist Workers’ Party has not put its signature to
  these amendments. (Laughter.) Indeed, just listen
  to what Terracini is defending and what his amendments
  say. They begin in this way: “On page 1, column 1,
  line 19, the word ‘majority’ should be
  deleted.” Majority! That is extremely dangerous!
  (Laughter.) Then further: instead of the words
  “’basic propositions’, insert
  ‘aims’”. Basic propositions and aims are
  two different things; even the anarchists will agree with us
  about aims, because they too stand for the abolition of
  exploitation and class distinctions.

  I have met and talked with few anarchists in my life, but
  all the same I have seen enough of them. I sometimes
  succeeded in reaching agreement with them about aims, but
  never as regards principles. Principles are not an aim, a
  programme, a tactic or a theory. Tactics and theory are not
  principles. How do we differ from the anarchists on
  principles? The principles of communism consist in the
  establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat and in
  the use of state coercion in the transition period. Such are
  the principles of communism, but they are not its aim. And
  the comrades who have tabled this proposal have made a
  mistake.

  Secondly, it is stated there: “the word
  ‘majority’ should be deleted.” Read the
  whole passage:

  “The Third Congress of the Communist International is
  setting out to review questions of tactics under conditions
  when in a whole number of countries the objective situation
  has become aggravated in a revolutionary sense, and when a
  whole number of communist mass parties have been organised,
  which, incidentally, in their actual revolutionary struggle
  have nowhere taken into their hands the virtual leadership
  of the majority of the working class.”

  And so, they want the word “majority”
  deleted. If we cannot agree on such simple things, then I do
  not understand how we can work together and lead the
  proletariat to victory. Then it is not at all surprising
  that we cannot reach agreement on the question of principles
  either. Show me a party which has already won the majority
  of the working class. Terracini did not even think of
  adducing any example. Indeed, there is no such example.

  And so, the word “aims” is to be put instead of
  “principles”, and the word
  “majority” is to be deleted. No, thank you! We
  shall not do it. Even the German party—one of the
  best—does not have the majority of the working class
  behind it. That is a fact. We, who face a most severe
  struggle, are not afraid to utter this truth, but here you
  have three delegations who wish to begin with an untruth,
  for if the Congress deletes the word “majority”
  it will show that it wants an untruth. That is quite
  clear.

  Then comes the following amendment:  “On page 4,
  column 1, line 10, the words ‘Open Letter’,
  etc., should be deleted.’’[13] I
  have already heard one speech today in which I found the
  same idea. But there it was quite natural. It was the speech
  of Comrade Hempel, a member of the German Communist
  Workers’ Party. He said: “The ‘Open
  Letter’ was an act of opportunism.” To my deep
  regret and shame, I have already heard such views
  privately. But when, at the Congress, after such prolonged
  debate, the “Open Letter” is declared
  opportunist—that is a shame and a disgrace! And now
  Comrade Terracini comes forward on behalf of the three
  delegations and wants to delete the words “Open
  Letter”. What is the good then of the fight against
  the German Communist Workers’ Party? The “Open
  Letter” is a model political step. This is stated in
  our theses and we must certainly stand by it. It is a model
  because it is the first act of a practical method of winning
  over the majority of the working class. In Europe, where
  almost all the proletarians are organised, we must win the
  majority of the working class and anyone who fails to
  understand this is lost to the communist movement; he will
  never learn anything if he has failed to learn that much
  during the three years of the great revolution.

  Terracini says that we were victorious in Russia although
  the Party was very small. He is dissatisfied with what is
  said in the theses about Czechoslovakia. Here there are 27
  amendments, and if I had a mind to criticise them I should,
  like some orators, have to speak for not less than three
  hours. . . . We have heard here that in Czechoslovakia the
  Communist Party has 300,000-400,000 members, and that it is
  essential to win over the majority, to create an invincible
  force and continue enlisting fresh masses of
  workers. Terracini is already prepared to attack. He says:
  if there are already 400,000 workers in the party, why
  should we want more? Delete! (Laughter.) He is
  afraid of the word “masses” and wants to
  eradicate it. Comrade Terracini has understood very little
  of the Russian revolution. In Russia, we were a small party,
  but we had with us in addition the majority of the Soviets
  of Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies throughout
  the country. (Cries : “Quite true!”) Do
  you have anything of the sort? We had with us almost half
  the army, which then numbered at least ten million men. Do
  you really have the majority of the army behind you? Show me
  such a country! If these views of Comrade Terracini are
  shared by three other delegations, then something is wrong
  in the International! Then we must say: “Stop! There
  must be a decisive fight! Otherwise the Communist
  International is lost.” (Animation.)

  On the basis of my experience I must say, although I am
  taking up a defensive position (laughter ),
  that-the aim and the principle of my speech consist in
  defence of the resolution and theses proposed by our
  delegation. It would, of course, be pedantic to say that not
  a letter in them must be altered. I have had to read many
  resolutions and I am well aware that very good amendments
  could he introduced in every line of them. But that would be
  pedantry. If, nevertheless, I declare now that in a
  political sense not a single letter can be altered, it is
  because the amendments, as I see them, are of a quite
  definite political nature and because they lead us along a
  path that is harmful and dangerous to the Communist
  International. Therefore, I and all of us and the Russian
  delegation must insist that not a single letter in the
  theses is altered. We have not only condemned our Right-wing
  elements—we have expelled them. But if, like
  Terracini, people turn the fight against the Rightists into
  a sport, then we must say: “Stop! Otherwise the danger
  will become too grave!”

  Terracini has defended the theory of an offensive
  struggle.[14] In this connection the
  notorious amendments propose a formula two or three pages
  long. There is no need for us to read them. We know what
  they say. Terracini has stated the issue quite clearly. He
  has defended the theory of an offensive, pointing out
  “dynamic tendencies” and the “transition
  from passivity to activity”. We in Russia have already
  had adequate political experience in the struggle against
  the Centrists. As long as fifteen years ago, we were waging
  a struggle against our opportunists and Centrists, and also
  against the Mensheviks, and we were victorious not only over
  the Mensheviks, but also over the semi-anarchists.

  If we had not done this, we would not have been able to
  retain power in our hands for three and a half years, or
  even for three and a half weeks, and we would not have been
  able to convene communist congresses here. “Dynamic
  tendencies”, “transition from passivity to
  activity”—these are all phrases the Left
  Socialist-Revolutionaries had used against us. Now they are
  in prison, defending there the “aims of
  communism” and thinking of the “transition from
  passivity to activity”. (Laughter.) The line
  of reasoning followed in the proposed amendments is an
  impossible one, because they contain no Marxism, no
  political experience, and no reasoning. Have we in our
  theses elaborated a general theory of the revolutionary
  offensive? Has Radek or anyone of us committed such a
  stupidity? We have spoken of the theory of an offensive in
  relation to a quite definite country and at a quite definite
  period.

  From our struggle against the Mensheviks we can quote
  instances showing that even before the first revolution
  there were some who doubted whether the revolutionary party
  aught to conduct an offensive. If such doubts assailed any
  Social-Democrat—as we all called ourselves at that
  time—we took up the struggle against him and said that
  he was an opportunist, that he did not understand anything
  of Marxism and the dialectics of the revolutionary party. Is
  it really possible for a party to dispute whether a
  revolutionary offensive is permissible in general? To find
  such examples in this country one would have to go back some
  fifteen years. If there are Centrists or disguised Centrists
  who dispute the theory of the offensive, they should be
  immediately expelled. That question cannot give rise to
  disputes. But the fact that-even now, after three years of
  the Communist International, we are arguing about
  “dynamic tendencies”, about the
  “transition from passivity to
  activity”—that is a shame and a disgrace.

  We do not have any dispute about this with Comrade Radek,
  who drafted these theses jointly with us. Perhaps it was not
  quite correct to begin talking in Germany about the
  theory of the revolutionary offensive when an actual
  offensive had not been prepared. Nevertheless the March
  action was a great step forward in spite of the mistakes of
  its leaders. But this does not matter. Hundreds of thousands
  of workers fought heroically. However courageously the
  German Communist Workers’ Party fought against the
  bourgeoisie, we must repeat what Comrade Radek said in a
  Russian article about Hölz. If anyone, even an
  anarchist, fights heroically against the bourgeoisie, that
  is, of course, a great thing; but it is a real step forward
  if hundreds of thousands fight against the vile provocation
  of the social-traitors and against the bourgeoisie.

  It is very important to be critical of one’s
  mistakes. We began with that. If anyone, after a struggle in
  which hundreds of thousands have taken part, comes out
  against this struggle and behaves like Levi, then he should
  be expelled. And that is what was done. But we must draw a
  lesson from this. Had we really prepared for an offensive?
  (Radek : “We had not even prepared for
  defence.”) Indeed only newspaper articles talked of an
  offensive. This theory as applied to the March action in
  Germany in 1921 was incorrect—we have to admit
  that—but, in general, the theory of the revolutionary
  offensive is not at all false.

  We were victorious in Russia, and with such ease, because we
  prepared for our revolution during the imperialist war. That
  was the first condition. Ten million workers and peasants in
  Russia were armed, and our slogan was: an immediate peace at
  all costs. We were victorious because the vast mass of the
  peasants were revolutionarily disposed against the big
  landowners. The Socialist-Revolutionaries, the adherents of
  the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals, were a big
  peasant party in November 1917. They demanded revolutionary
  methods but, like true heroes of the Second and the
  Two-and-a-Half Internationals, lacked the courage to act in
  a revolutionary way. In August  and September 1917 we said:
  “Theoretically we are fighting the
  Socialist-Revolutionaries as we did before, but practically
  we are ready to accept their programme because only we are
  able to put it into effect.” We did just what we
  said. The peasantry, ill-disposed towards us in November
  1917, after our victory, who sent a majority of
  Socialist-Revolutionaries into the Constituent Assembly,
  were won over by us, if not in the course of a few
  days—as I mistakenly expected and predicted—at
  any rate in the course of a few weeks. The difference was
  not great. Can you point out any country in Europe where you
  could win over the majority of the peasantry in the course
  of a few weeks? Italy perhaps? (Laughter.) If it is
  said that we were victorious in Russia in spite of not
  having a big party, that only proves that those who say it
  have not understood the Russian revolution and that they
  have absolutely no understanding of how to prepare for a
  revolution.

  Our first step was to create a real Communist Party so as to
  know whom we were talking to and whom we could fully
  trust. The slogan of the First and Second congresses was
  “Down with the Centrists!” We cannot hope to
  master even the ABC of communism, unless all along the line
  and throughout the world we make short shrift of the
  Centrists and semi-Centrists, whom in Russia we call
  Mensheviks. Our first task is to create a genuinely
  revolutionary party and to break with the Mensheviks. But
  that is only a preparatory school. We are already convening
  the Third Congress, and Comrade Terracini keeps saying that
  thc task of the preparatory school collsists in hunting out,
  pursuing and exposing Centrists and semi-Centrists. No,
  thank you! We have already done this long enough. At the
  Second Congress we said that the Centrists are our
  enemies. But, we must go forward really. The second stage,
  after organising into a party, consists in learning to
  prepare for revolution. In many countries we have not even
  learned how to assume the leadership. We were victorious in
  Russia not only because the undisputed majority of the
  working class was on our side (during the elections in 1917
  the overwhelming majority of the workers were with us
  against the Mensheviks), but also because half the army,
  immediately after our seizure of power, and nine-tenths of
  the peasants,  in the course of some weeks, came over to our
  side; we were victorious because we adopted the agrarian
  programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries instead of our
  own, and put it into effect. Our victory lay in the fact
  that we carried out the Socialist-Revolutionary programme;
  that is why this victory was so easy. Is it possible that
  you in the West can have such illusions? It is ridiculous!
  Just compare the concrete economic conditions, Comrade
  Terracini and all of you who have signed the proposed
  amendments! In spite of the fact that the majority so
  rapidly came to be on our side, the difficulties confronting
  us after our victory were very great. Nevertheless we won
  through because we kept in mind not only our aims but also
  our principles, and did not tolerate in our Party those who
  kept silent about principles but talked of aims,
  “dynamic tendencies” and the “transition
  from passivity to activity”. Perhaps we shall be
  blamed for preferring to keep such gentlemen in prison. But
  dictatorship is impossible in any other way. We must prepare
  for dictatorship, and this consists in combating such
  phrases and such amendments. (Laughter.)
  Throughout, our theses speak of the masses. But, comrades,
  we need to understand what is meant by masses. The German
  Communist Workers’ Party, the Left-wing comrades,
  misuse this word. But Comrade Terracini, too, and all those
  who have signed these amendments, do not know how the word
  “masses” should be read.

  I have been speaking too long as it is; hence I wish to say
  only a few words about the concept of
  “masses”. It is one that changes in accordance
  with the changes in the nature of the struggle. At the
  beginning of the struggle it took only a few thousand
  genuinely revolutionary workers to warrant talk of the
  masses. If the party succeeds in drawing into the struggle
  not only its own members, if it also succeeds in arousing
  non-party people, it is well on the way to winning the
  masses. During our revolutions there were instances when
  several thousand workers represented the masses. In the
  history of our movement, and of our struggle against the
  Mensheviks, you will find many examples where several
  thousand workers in a town were enough to give a clearly
  mass character to the movement. You have a mass when several
  thousand non-party workers, who  usually live a philistine
  life and drag out a miserable existence, and who have never
  heard anything about politics, begin to act in a
  revolutionary way. If the movement spreads and intensifies,
  it gradually develops into a real revolution. We saw this in
  1905 and 1917 during three revolutions, and you too will
  have to go through all this. When the revolution has been
  sufficiently prepared, the concept “masses”
  becomes different: several thousand workers no longer
  constitute the masses. This word begins to denote something
  else. The concept of “masses” undergoes a change
  so that it implies the majority, and not simply a majority
  of the workers alone, but the majority of all the
  exploited. Any other kind of interpretation is impermissible
  for a revolutionary, and any other sense of the word becomes
  incomprehensible. It is possible that even a small party,
  the British or American party, for example, after it has
  thoroughly studied the course of political development and
  become acquainted with the life and customs of the non party
  masses, will at a favourable moment evoke a revolutionary
  movement  (Comrade Radek has pointed to the miners’
  strike as a good example[15]). You will
  have a mass movement if such a party comes forward with its
  slogans at such a moment and succeeds in getting millions of
  workers to follow it. I would not altogether deny that a
  revolution can be started by a very small party and brought
  to a victorious conclusion. But one must have a knowledge of
  the methods by which the masses can be won over. For this
  thoroughgoing preparation of revolution is essential. But
  here you have comrades coming forward with the assertion
  that we should immediately give up the demand for
  “big” masses. They must be challenged. Without
  thoroughgoing preparation you will not achieve victory in
  any country. Quite a small party is sufficient to lead the
  masses. At certain times there is no necessity for big
  organisations.

  But to win, we must have the sympathy of the masses. An
  absolute majority is not always essential; but what is
  essential to win and retain power is not only the majority
  of the working class—I use the term “working
  class” in its West-European sense, i.e., in the sense
  of the industrial proletariat—but also the majority of
  the working and exploited rural population. Have you thought
  about this?

  Do we find in Terracini’s speech even a hint at this
  thought? He speaks only of “dynamic tendency”
  and the “transition from passivity to
  activity”. Does he devote even a single word to the
  food question? And yet the workers demand their victuals,
  although they can put up with a great deal and go hungry, as
  we have seen to a certain extent in Russia. We must,
  therefore, win over to our side not only the majority of the
  working class, but also the majority of the working and
  exploited rural population. Have you prepared for this?
  Almost nowhere.

  And so, I repeat: I must unreservedly defend our theses and
  I feel I am bound to do it. We not only condemned the
  Centrists but expelled them from the Party. Now we must deal
  with another aspect, which we also consider dangerous. We
  must tell the comrades the truth in the most polite form
  (and in our theses it is told in a kind and considerate way)
  so that no one feels insulted: we are confronted now by
  other, more important questions than that of attacks on the
  Centrists. We have had enough of this question. It has
  already become somewhat boring. Instead, the comrades ought
  to learn to wage a real revolutionary struggle. The German
  workers have already begun this. Hundreds of thousands of
  proletarians in that country have been fighting
  heroically. Anyone who opposes this struggle should be
  immediately expelled. But after that we must not engage in
  empty word-spinning but must immediately begin to learn, on
  the basis of the mistakes made, how to organise the struggle
  better. We must not conceal our mistakes from the
  enemy. Anyone who is afraid of this is no revolutionary. On
  the contrary, if we openly declare to the workers:
  “Yes, we have made mistakes”, it will mean that
  they will not be repeated and we shall be able better to
  choose the moment. And if during the struggle itself the
  majority of the working people prove to be on our
  side—not only the majority of the workers, but the
  majority of all the exploited and oppressed—then we
  shall really be victorious. (Prolonged, stormy
  applause.)

  Report On The Tactics Of The R.C.P.
  July 5

  Comrades, strictly speaking I was unable to prepare properly
  for this report. All that I was able to prepare for you in
  the way of systematic material was a translation of my
  pamphlet on the tax in kind and the theses on the tactics of
  the Russian Communist Party. To this I merely want to add a
  few explanations and remarks.

  I think that to explain our Party’s tactics we must
  first of all examine the international
  situation. We have already had a detailed discussion of
  the economic position of capitalism  internationally, and
  the Congress has adopted definite resolutions on this
  subject.[16] I deal with this subject in my
  theses very briefly, and only from the political stand
  point. I leave aside the economic basis, but I think that in
  discussing the international position of our Republic we
  must, politically, take into account the fact that a certain
  equilibrium has now undoubtedly set in between the forces
  that have been waging an open, armed struggle against each
  other for the supremacy of this or that leading class. It is
  an equilibrium between bourgeois society, the international
  bourgeoisie as a whole, and Soviet Russia. It is, of course,
  an equilibrium only in a limited sense. It is only in
  respect to this military struggle, I say, that a certain
  equilibrium has been brought about in the international
  situation. It must be emphasised, of course, that this is
  only a relative equilibrium, and a very unstable one. Much
  inflammable material has accumulated in capitalist
  countries, as well as in those countries which up to now
  have been regarded merely as the objects and not as the
  subjects of history, i.e., the colonies and
  semi-colonies. It is quite possible, therefore, that
  insurrections, great battles and  revolutions may break out
  there sooner or later, and very suddenly too. During the
  past few years we have witnessed the direct struggle waged
  by the international bourgeoisie against the first
  proletarian republic. This struggle has been at the centre
  of the world political situation, and it is there that a
  change has taken place. Inasmuch as the attempt of the
  international bourgeoisie to strangle our Republic has
  failed, an equilibrium has set in, and a very unstable one
  it is, of course.

  We know perfectly well, of course, that the international
  bourgeoisie is at present much stronger than our Republic,
  and that it is only the peculiar combination of
  circumstances that is preventing it from continuing the war
  against us. For several weeks now, we have witnessed fresh
  attempts in the Far East to renew the invasion,[17]
  and there is not the slightest doubt that similar attempts
  will continue. Our Party has no doubts whatever on that
  score. The important thing for us is to establish that an
  unstable equilibrium does exist, and that we must take
  advantage of this respite, taking into consideration the
  characteristic features of the present situation, adapting
  our tactics to the specific features of this situation, and
  never forgetting that the necessity for armed struggle may
  arise again quite suddenly. Our task is still to organise
  and build up the Red Army. In connection with the food
  problem, too, we must continue to think first of all of our
  Red Army. We can adopt no other line in the present
  international situation, when we must still be prepared for
  fresh attacks and fresh attempts at invasion on the part of
  the international bourgeoisie. In regard to our practical
  policy, however, the fact that a certain equilibrium has
  been reached in the international situation has some
  significance, but only in the sense that we must admit that,
  although the revolutionary movement has made-progress, the
  development of the international revolution this year has
  not proceeded along as straight a line as we had
  expected.

  When we started the international revolution, we did so not
  because we were convinced that we could forestall its
  development, but because a number of circumstances compelled
  us to start it. We thought: either the international
  revolution comes to our assistance, and in that case our
  victory will be fully assured, or we shall do our modest
  revolutionary work in the conviction that even in the event
  of defeat we shall have served the cause of the revolution
  and that our experience will benefit other revolutions. It
  was clear to us that without the support of the
  international world revolution the victory of the
  proletarian revolution was impossible. Before the
  revolution, and even after it, we thought: either revolution
  breaks out in the other countries, in the capitalistically
  more developed countries, immediately, or at least very
  quickly, or we must perish. In spite of this conviction, we
  did all we possibly could to preserve the Soviet system
  under all circumstances, come what may, because we knew that
  we were not only working for ourselves, but also for the
  international revolution. We knew this, we repeatedly
  expressed this conviction before the October Revolution,
  immediately after it, and at the time we signed the
  Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty. And, generally speaking, this
  was correct.

  Actually, however, events did not proceed along as straight
  a line as we had expected. In the other big,
  capitalistically more developed countries the revolution has
  not broken out to this day. True, we can say with
  satisfaction that the revolution is developing all over the
  world, and it is only thanks to this that the international
  bourgeoisie is unable to strangle us, inspite of the fact
  that, militarily and economically, it is a hundred times
  stronger than we are. (Applause.)

  In Paragraph 2 of the theses I examine the manner in which
  this situation arose, and the conclusions that must be drawn
  from it. Let me add that my final conclusion is the
  following: the development of the international revolution,
  which we predicted, is proceeding, but not along as straight
  a line as we had expected. It becomes clear at the first
  glance that after the conclusion of peace, bad as it was, it
  proved impossible to call forth revolution in other
  capitalist countries, although we know that the signs of
  revolution were very considerable and numerous, in fact,
  much more considerable and numerous than we thought at the
  time. Pamphlets are now beginning to appear which tell us
  that during the past few years and months these
  revolutionary symptoms in Europe have been much more serious
  than we had suspected. What, in that case, must we do now?
  We must now thoroughly prepare for revolution and make a
  deep study of its concrete development in the advanced
  capitalist countries. This is the first lesson we must draw
  from the international situation. As for our Russian
  Republic, we must take advantage of this brief respite in
  order to adapt our tactics to this zigzag line of
  history. This equilibrium is very important politically,
  because we clearly see that in many West-European countries,
  where the broad mass of the working class, and possibly the
  overwhelming majority of the population, are organised, the
  main bulwark of the bourgeoisie consists of the hostile
  working-class organisations affiliated to the Second and the
  Two-and-a-Half Internationals. I speak of this in Paragraph
  2 of the theses, and I think that in this connection I need
  deal with only two points, which were discussed during the
  debate on the question of tactics. First, winning over the
  majority of the proletariat. The more organised the
  proletariat is in a capitalistically developed country, the
  greater thoroughness does history demand of us in preparing
  for revolution, and the more thoroughly must we win over the
  majority of the working class. Second, the main bulwark of
  capitalism in the industrially developed capitalist
  countries is the part of the working class that is organised
  in the Second and the Two-and-a-Half Internationals. But for
  the support of this section of the workers, these
  counter-revolutionary elements within the working class, the
  international bourgeoisie would be altogether unable to
  retain its position. (Applause.)

  Here I would also like to emphasise the significance of
  the movement in the colonies. In this respect we
  see in all the old parties, in all the bourgeois and
  petty-bourgeois labour parties affiliated to the Second and
  the Two-and-a Half Internationals, survivals of the old
  sentimental views: they insist on their profound sympathy
  for oppressed colonial and semi-colonial peoples. The
  movement in the colonial countries is still regarded as an
  insignificant national and totally peaceful movement. But
  this is not so. It has undergone great change since the
  beginning of the twentieth century: millions and hundreds of
  millions, in fact the overwhelming majority of the
  population of the globe, are  now coming forward as
  independent, active and revolutionary factors. It is
  perfectly clear that in the impending decisive battles in
  the world revolution, the movement of the majority of the
  population of the globe, initially directed towards national
  liberation, will turn against capitalism and imperialism and
  will, perhaps, play a much more revolutionary part than we
  expect. It is important to emphasise the fact that, for the
  first time in our International, we have taken up the
  question of preparing for this struggle. Of course, there
  are many more difficulties in this enormous sphere than in
  any other, but at all events the movement is advancing. And
  in spite of the fact that the masses of toilers—the
  peasants in the colonial countries—are still backward,
  they will play a very important revolutionary part in the
  coming phases of the world revolution. (Animated
  approval.)

  As regards the internal political position of our Republic I
  must start with a close examination of class
  relationships. During the past few months changes have taken
  place in this sphere, and we have witnessed the formation of
  new organisations of the exploiting class directed against
  us. The aim of socialism is to abolish classes. In the front
  ranks of the exploiting class we find the big landowners and
  the industrial capitalists. In regard to them, the work of
  destruction is fairly easy; it can be completed within a few
  months, and sometimes even a few weeks or days. We in Russia
  have expropriated our exploiters, the big landowners as well
  as the capitalists. They had no organisations of their own
  during the war and operated merely as the appendages of the
  military forces of the international bourgeoisie. Now, after
  we have repulsed the attacks of the international
  counter-revolution, organisations of the Russian bourgeoisie
  and of all the Russian counter-revolutionary parties have
  been formed abroad. The number of Russian émigrés
  scattered in all foreign countries may be estimated at one
  and a half to two millions. In nearly every country they
  publish daily newspapers, and all the parties, landowner and
  petty-bourgeois, not excluding the Socialist-Revolutionaries
  and Mensheviks, have numerous ties with foreign bourgeois
  elements, that is to say, they obtain enough money to run
  their own press. We find the collaboration abroad of
  absolutely all the political parties that formerly existed
  in Russia, and we see how the “free” Russian
  press abroad, from the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
  press to the most reactionary monarchist press, is
  championing the great landed interests. This, to a certain
  extent, facilitates our task, because we can more easily
  observe the forces of the enemy, his state of organisation,
  and the political trends in his camp. On the other hand, of
  course, it hinders our work, because these Russian
  counter-revolutionary émigrés use every means at
  their disposal to prepare for a fight against us. This fight
  again shows that, taken as a whole, the class instinct and
  class-consciousness of the ruling classes are still superior
  to those of the oppressed classes, notwithstanding the fact
  that the Russian revolution has done more than any previous
  revolution in this respect. In Russia, there is hardly a
  village in which the people, the oppressed, have not been
  roused. Nevertheless, if we take a cool look at the state of
  organisation and political clarity of views of the Russian
  counter-revolutionary émigrés, we shall find that
  the class-consciousness of the bourgeoisie is still superior
  to that of the exploited and the oppressed. These people
  make every possible attempt and skilfully take advantage of
  every opportunity to attack Soviet Russia in one way or
  another, and to dismember it. It would be very
  instructive—and I think the foreign comrades will do
  that—systematically to watch the most important
  aspirations, the most important tactical moves, and the most
  important trends of this Russian counter-revolution. It
  operates chiefly abroad, and it will not be very difficult
  for the foreign comrades to watch it. In some respects, we
  ought to learn from this enemy. These counter-revolutionary
  émigrés are very well informed, they are
  excellently organised and are good strategists. And I think
  that a systematic comparison and study of the manner in
  which they are organised and take advantage of every
  opportunity may have a powerful propaganda effect upon the
  working class. This is not general theory, it is practical
  politics; here we can see what the enemy has learned. During
  the past few years, the Russian bourgeoisie has suffered a
  terrible defeat. There is an old saying that a beaten army
  learns a great deal. The beaten reactionary army has learned
  a  great deal, and has learned it thoroughly. It is learning
  with great avidity, and has really made much headway. When
  we took power at one swoop, the Russian bourgeoisie was
  unorganised and politically undeveloped. Now, I think, its
  development is on a par with modern, West-European
  development. We must take this into account, we must improve
  our own organisation and methods, and we shall do our utmost
  to achieve this. It was relatively easy for us, and I think
  that it will be equally easy for other revolutions, to cope
  with these two exploiting classes.

  But, in addition to this class of exploiters, there is in
  nearly all capitalist countries, with the exception,
  perhaps, of Britain, a class of small producers and small
  farmers. The main problem of the revolution now is how to
  fight these two classes. In order to be rid of them, we must
  adopt methods other than those employed against the big
  landowners and capitalists. We could simply expropriate and
  expel both of these classes, and that is what we did. But we
  cannot do the same thing with the remaining capitalist
  classes, the small producers and the petty bourgeoisie,
  which are found in all countries. In most capitalist
  countries, these classes constitute a very considerable
  minority, approximately from thirty to forty-five per cent
  of the population. Add to them the petty-bourgeois elements
  of the working class, and you get even more than fifty per
  cent. These cannot be expropriated or expelled; other
  methods of struggle must be adopted in their case. From the
  international standpoint, if we regard the international
  revolution as one process, the significance of the period
  into which we are now entering in Russia is, in essence,
  that we must now find a practical solution for the problem
  of the relations the proletariat should establish with this
  last capitalist class in Russia. All Marxists have a correct
  and ready solution for this problem in theory. But theory
  and practice are two different things, and the practical
  solution of this problem is by no means the same as the
  theoretical solution. We know definitely that we have made
  serious mistakes. From the international standpoint, it is a
  sign of great progress that we are now trying to determine
  the attitude the proletariat in power should adopt towards
  the last capitalist class—the rock-bottom  of
  capitalism—small private property, the small
  producer. This problem now confronts us in a practical
  way. I think we shall solve it. At all events, the
  experiment we are making will be useful for future
  proletarian revolutions, and they will be able to make
  better technical preparations for solving it.

  In my theses I tried to analyse the problem of the
  relations between the proletariat and the
  peasantry. For the first time in history there is a
  state with only two classes, the proletariat and the
  peasantry. The latter constitutes the overwhelming majority
  of the population. It is, of course, very backward. How do
  the relations between the peasantry and the proletariat,
  which holds political power, find practical expression in
  the development of the revolution? The first form is
  alliance, close alliance. This is a very difficult task, but
  at any rate it is economically and politically feasible.

  How did we approach this problem practically? We concluded
  an alliance with the peasantry. We interpret this alliance
  in the following way: the proletariat emancipates the
  peasantry from the exploitation of the bourgeoisie, from its
  leadership and influence, and wins it over to its own side
  in order jointly to defeat the exploiters.

  The Menshevik argument runs like this: the peasantry
  constitutes a majority; we are pure democrats, therefore,
  the majority should decide. But as the peasantry cannot
  operate on its own, this, in practice, means nothing more
  nor less than the restoration of capitalism. The slogan is
  the same: Alliance with the peasantry. When we say that, we
  mean strengthening and consolidating the proletariat: We
  have tried to give effect to this alliance between the
  proletariat and the peasantry, and the first stage was a
  military alliance. The three years of the Civil War created
  enormous difficulties, but in certain respects they
  facilitated our task. This may-sound odd, but it is
  true. The war was not something new for the peasants; a war
  against the exploiters, against the big landowners, was
  something they quite understood. The overwhelming majority
  of the peasants were on our side. In spite of the enormous
  distances, and the fact that the overwhelming majority of
  our peasants are unable to read or write, they assimilated
  our propaganda very easily. This proves that the broad
  masses—and  this applies also to the most advanced
  countries—learn faster from their own practical
  experience than from books. In Russia, moreover, learning
  from practical experience was facilitated for the peasantry
  by the fact that the country is so exceptionally large that
  in the same period different parts of it were passing
  through different stages of development.

  In Siberia and in the Ukraine the counter-revolution was
  able to gain a temporary victory because there the
  bourgeoisie had the peasantry on its side, because the
  peasants were against us. The peasants frequently said,
  “We are Bolsheviks, but not Communists. We are for the
  Bolsheviks because they drove out the landowners; but we are
  not for the Communists because they are opposed to
  individual farming.” And for a time, the
  counter-revolution managed to win out in Siberia and in the
  Ukraine because the bourgeoisie made headway in the struggle
  for influence over the peasantry. But it took only a very
  short time to open the peasants’ eyes. They quickly
  acquired practical experience and soon said, “Yes, the
  Bolsheviks are rather unpleasant people, we don’t like
  them, but still they are better than the whiteguards and the
  Constituent Assembly.” “Constituent
  Assembly” is a term of abuse not only among the
  educated Communists, but also among the peasants. They know
  from practical experience that the Constituent Assembly and
  the whiteguards stand for the same thing, that the former is
  inevitably followed by the latter. The Mensheviks also
  resort to a military alliance with the peasantry, but they
  fail to understand that a military alliance alone is
  inadequate. There can be no military alliance without an
  economic alliance. It takes more than air to keep a man
  alive; our alliance with the peasantry could not possibly
  have lasted any length of time without the economic
  foundation, which was the basis of our victory in the war
  against our bourgeoisie. After all our bourgeoisie has
  united with the whole of the international bourgeoisie.

  The basis of our economic alliance with the peasantry was,
  of course, very simple, and even crude. The peasant obtained
  from us all the land and support against the big
  landowners. In return for this, we were to obtain food. This
  alliance was something entirely new and did not rest on the
  ordinary relations between commodity producers and
  consumers. Our peasants had a much better understanding of
  this than the heroes of the Second and the Two-and a-Half
  Internationals. They said to themselves, “These
  Bolsheviks are stern leaders, but after all they are our own
  people.” Be that as it may, we created in this way the
  foundations of a new economic alliance. The peasants gave
  their produce to the Red Army and received from the latter
  assistance in protecting their possessions. This is always
  forgotten by the heroes of the Second International, who,
  like Otto Bauer, totally fail to understand the actual
  situation. We confess that the initial form of this alliance
  was very primitive and that we made very many mistakes. But
  we were obliged to act as quickly as possible, we had to
  organise supplies for the army at all costs. During the
  Civil War we were cut off from all the grain districts of
  Russia. We were in a terrible position, and it looks like a
  miracle that the Russian people and the working class were
  able to endure such suffering, want, and privation,
  sustained by nothing more than a deep urge for
  victory. (Animated approval and applause.)

  When the Civil War came to an end, however, we faced a
  different problem. If the country had not been so laid waste
  after seven years of incessant war, it would, perhaps, have
  been possible to find an easier transition to the new form
  of alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry. But
  bad as conditions in the country were, they were still
  further aggravated by the crop failure, the fodder shortage,
  etc. In consequence, the sufferings of the peasants became
  unbearable. We had to show the broad masses of the peasants
  immediately that we were prepared to change our policy,
  without in any way deviating from our revolutionary path, so
  that they could say, “The Bolsheviks want to improve
  our intolerable condition immediately, and at all
  costs.”

  And so, our economic policy was changed; the tax in
  kind superseded the requisitions. This was not invented at
  one stroke. You will find a number of proposals in the
  Bolshevik press over a period of months, but no plan that
  really promised success. But this is not important. The
  important  thing is that we changed our, economic policy,
  yielding to exclusively practical considerations, and
  impelled by necessity. A bad harvest, fodder shortage and
  lack of fuel—all, of course, have a decisive influence
  on the economy as a whole, including the peasant economy. If
  the peasantry goes on strike, we get no firewood; and if we
  get no firewood, the factories will have to idle. Thus, in
  the spring of 1921, the economic crisis resulting from the
  terrible crop failure and the fodder shortage assumed
  gigantic proportions. All that was the aftermath of the
  three years of civil war. We had to show the peasantry that
  we could and would quickly change our policy in order
  immediately to alleviate their distress. We have always
  said—and it was also said at the Second
  Congress—that revolution demands sacrifices. Some
  comrades in their propaganda argue in the following way: we
  are prepared to stage a revolution, but it must not be too
  severe. Unless I am mistaken, this thesis was put forward by
  Comrade Smeral in his speech at the Congress of the
  Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.  I read about it in the
  report published in the Reichenberg Vorwärts[18] There is evidently a Leftist
  wing there; hence this source cannot be regarded as being
  quite impartial. At all events, I must say that if Smeral
  did say that, he was wrong. Some comrades who spoke after
  Smeral at this Congress said, “Yes, we shall go along
  with Smeral because in this way we shall avoid civil
  war.” (Laughter.) If these reports are true,
  I must say that such agitation is neither communistic nor
  revolutionary. Naturally, every revolution entails enormous
  sacrifice on the part of the class making it. Revolution
  differs from ordinary struggle in that ten and even a
  hundred times more people take part in it. Hence every
  revolution entails sacrifices not only for individuals, but
  for a whole class. The dictatorship of the proletariat in
  Russia has entailed for the ruling class—the
  proletariat—sacrifices, want and privation
  unprecedented in history, and the case will, in all
  probability, be the same in every other country.

  The question arises: How are we to distribute this burden of
  privation? We are the state power. We are able to distribute
  the burden of privation to a certain extent, and to impose
  it upon several classes, thereby relatively alleviating the
  condition of certain strata of the population.

  But what is to be our principle? Is it to be that of
  fairness, or of majority? No. We must act in a practical
  manner. We must distribute the burdens in such a way as to
  preserve the power of the proletariat. This is our only
  principle. In the beginning of the revolution the working
  class was compelled to suffer incredible want. Let me state
  that from year to year our food policy has been achieving
  increasing success. And the situation as a whole has
  undoubtedly improved. But the peasantry in Russia has
  certainly gained more from the revolution than the working
  class. There is no doubt about that at all. From the
  standpoint of theory, this shows, of course, that our
  revolution was to some degree a bourgeois revolution. When
  Kautsky used this as an argument against us, we
  laughed. Naturally, a revolution which does not expropriate
  the big landed estates, expel the big landowners or divide
  the land is only a bourgeois revolution and not a socialist
  one. But we were the only party to carry the bourgeois
  revolution to its conclusion and to facilitate the struggle
  for the socialist revolution. The Soviet power and the
  Soviet system are institutions of the socialist state. We
  have already established these institutions, but we have not
  yet solved the problem of economic relations between the
  peasantry and the proletariat. Much remains to be done, and
  the outcome of this struggle depends upon whether we solve
  this problem or not. Thus, the distribution of the burden of
  privation is one of the most difficult practical
  problems. On the whole, the condition of the peasants has
  improved, but dire suffering has fallen to the lot of the
  working class, precisely because it is exercising its
  dictatorship.

  I have already said that in the spring of 1921 the most
  appalling want caused by the fodder shortage and the crop
  failure prevailed among the peasantry, which constitutes the
  majority of our population. We cannot possibly exist unless
  we have good relations with the peasant masses. Hence, our
  task was to render them immediate assistance. The condition
  of the working class is extremely hard. It is suffering
  horribly. Those who have more political understanding,
  however, realise that in the interest of the dictatorship of
  the working class we must make tremendous efforts to help
  the peasants at any price. The vanguard of the  working
  class has realised this, but in that vanguard there are
  still people who cannot understand it, and who are too weary
  to understand it. They regarded it as a mistake and began to
  use the word “opportunism”. They said,
  “The Bolsheviks are helping the peasants. The
  peasants, who are exploiting us, are getting everything they
  please, while the workers are starving.” But is that
  opportunism? We are helping the peasants because without an
  alliance with them the political power of the proletariat is
  impossible, its preservation is inconceivable. It was this
  consideration of expediency and not that of fair
  distribution that was decisive for us. We are assisting the
  peasants because it is absolutely necessary to do so in
  order that we may retain political power. The supreme
  principle of the dictatorship is the maintenance of the
  alliance between the proletariat and the peasantry in order
  that the proletariat may retain its leading role and its
  political power.

  The only means we found for this was the adoption of the tax
  in kind, which was the inevitable consequence of the
  struggle. This year, we shall introduce this tax for the
  first time. This principle has not yet been tried in
  practice. From the military alliance we must pass to an
  economic alliance, and, theoretically, the only basis for
  the latter is the introduction of the tax in kind. It
  provides the only theoretical possibility for laying a
  really solid economic foundation for socialist society. The
  socialised factory gives the peasant its manufactures and in
  return the peasant gives his grain. This is the only
  possible form of existence of socialist society, the only
  form of socialist development in a country in which the
  small peasants constitute the majority, or at all events a
  very considerable minority. The peasants will give one part
  of their produce in the form of tax and another either in
  exchange for the manufactures of socialist factories, or
  through the exchange of commodities.

  This brings us to the most difficult problem. It goes
  without saying that the tax in kind means freedom to
  trade. After having paid the tax in kind, the peasant will
  have the right freely to exchange the remainder of his
  grain. This freedom of exchange implies freedom for
  capitalism. We say this openly and emphasise it. We do not
  conceal it in the least. Things would go very hard with us
  if we  attempted to conceal it. Freedom to trade means
  freedom for capitalism, but it also means a new form of
  capitalism. It means that, to a certain extent, we are
  re-creating capitalism. We are doing this quite openly. It
  is state capitalism. But state capitalism in a society where
  power belongs to capital, and state capitalism in a
  proletarian state, are two different concepts. In a
  capitalist state, state capitalism means that it is
  recognised by the state and controlled by it for the benefit
  of the bourgeoisie, and to the detriment of the
  proletariat. In the proletarian state, the same thing is
  done for the benefit of the working class, for the purpose
  of withstanding the as yet strong bourgeoisie, and of
  fighting it. It goes without saying that we must grant
  concessions to the foreign bourgeoisie, to foreign
  capital. Without the slightest denationalisation, we shall
  lease mines, forests and oilfields to foreign capitalists,
  and receive in exchange manufactured goods, machinery, etc.,
  and thus restore our own industry.

  Of course, we did not all agree on the question of state
  capitalism at once. But we are very pleased to note in this
  connection that our peasantry has been developing, that it
  has fully realised the historical significance of the
  struggle we are waging at the present time. Ordinary
  peasants from the most remote districts have come to us and
  said: “What! We have expelled our capitalists, the
  capitalists who speak Russian, and now foreign capitalists
  are coming!” Does not this show that our peasants have
  developed? There is no need to explain to a worker who is
  versed in economics why this is necessary. We have been so
  ruined by seven years of war that it will take many years to
  restore our industry. We must pay for our backwardness and
  weakness, and for the lessons we are now learning and must
  learn. Those who want to learn must pay for the tuition. We
  must explain this to one and all, and if we prove it in
  practice, the vast masses of the peasants and workers will
  agree with us, because in this way their condition will be
  immediately improved, and because it will ensure the
  possibility of restoring our industry. What compels us to do
  this? We are not alone in the world.  We exist in a system
  of capitalist states. [19]. . . On one
  side, there are the colonial countries, but they cannot help
  us yet. On the other side, there are the  capitalist
  countries, but they are our enemies. The result is a certain
  equilibrium, a very poor one, it is true. Nevertheless, we
  must reckon with the fact. We must not shut our eyes to it
  if we want to exist. Either we score an immediate victory
  over the whole bourgeoisie, or we pay the tribute.

  We admit quite openly, and do not conceal the fact, that
  concessions in the system of state capitalism mean paying
  tribute to capitalism. But we gain time, and gaining time
  means gaining everything, particularly in the period of
  equilibrium, when our foreign comrades are preparing
  thoroughly for their revolution. The more thorough their
  preparations, the more certain will the victory
  be. Meanwhile, however, we shall have to pay the
  tribute.

  A few words about our food policy. Undoubtedly, it was a bad
  and primitive policy. But we can also point to some
  achievements. In this connection I must once again emphasise
  that the only possible economic foundation of socialism is
  large-scale machine industry. Whoever forgets this is no
  Communist. We must analyse this problem concretely. We
  cannot present problems in the way the theoreticians of the
  old school of socialism do. We must present them in a
  practical manner. What is modern large-scale industry? It is
  the electrification of the whole of Russia. Sweden, Germany
  and America have almost achieved this, although they are
  still bourgeois. A Swedish comrade told me that in Sweden a
  large part of industry and thirty per cent of agriculture
  are electrified. In Germany and America, which are even more
  developed capitalistically, we see the same thing on a
  larger scale. Large-scale machine industry is nothing more
  nor less than the electrification of the whole country. We
  have already appointed a special commission consisting of
  the country’s best economists and engineers. It is
  true that nearly all of them are hostile to the Soviet
  power. All these specialists will come over to communism,
  but not our way, not by way of twenty years of underground
  work, during which we unceasingly studied and repeated over
  and over again the ABC of communism.

  Nearly all the Soviet government bodies were in favour of
  inviting the specialists. The expert engineers will come to
  us when we give them practical proof that this will
  increase the country’s productive forces. It is not
  enough to prove it to them in theory; we must prove it to
  them in practice, and we shall win these people over to our
  side if we present the problem differently, not from the
  standpoint of the theoretical propaganda of communism. We
  say: large-scale industry is the only means of saving the
  peasantry from want and starvation. Everyone agrees with
  this. But how can it be done? The restoration of industry on
  the old basis will entail too much labour and time. We must
  give industry a more modern form, i.e., we must adopt
  electrification. This will take much less time. We have
  already drawn up the plans for electrification. More than
  two hundred specialists—almost to a man opposed to the
  Soviet power—worked on it with keen interest, although
  they are not Communists. From the standpoint of technical
  science, however, they had to admit that this was the only
  correct way. Of course, we have a long way to go before the
  plan is achieved. The cautious specialists say that the
  first series of works will take at least ten
  years. Professor Ballod has estimated that it would take
  three to four years to electrify Germany. But for us even
  ten years is not enough. In my theses I quote actual figures
  to show you how little we have been able to do in this
  sphere up to now. The figures I quote are so modest that it
  immediately becomes clear that they are more of propaganda
  than scientific value. But we must begin with
  propaganda. The Russian peasants who fought in the world war
  and lived in Germany for several years learned how modern
  farming should be carried on in order to conquer famine. We
  must carry on extensive propaganda in this direction. Taken
  by themselves, these plans are not yet of great practical
  value, but their propaganda value is very great.

  The peasants realise that something new must be
  created. They realise that this cannot be done by everybody
  working separately, but by the state working as a whole. The
  peasants who were prisoners of war in Germany found out what
  real cultural life is based on. Twelve thousand kilowatts is
  a very modest beginning. This may sound funny to the
  foreigner who is familiar with electrification in America,
  Germany or Sweden. But he laughs best who laughs last. It
  is, indeed, a modest beginning. But the peasants are
  beginning to understand that new work must be carried out on
  a grand scale, and that this work has already
  begun. Enormous difficulties will have to be overcome. We
  shall try to establish relations with the capitalist
  countries. We must not regret having to give the capitalists
  several hundred million kilogrammes of oil on condition that
  they help us to electrify our country.

  And now, in conclusion, a few words about “pure
  democracy”. I will read you a passage from
  Engels’s letter to Bebel of December 11, 1884. He
  wrote:

  “Pure democracy . . . when the moment of revolution
  comes, acquires a temporary importance as the extreme
  bourgeois party, as which it already played itself off in
  Frankfort, and as the final sheet-anchor of the whole
  bourgeois and even feudal economy. . . . Thus between March
  and September 1848 the whole feudal-bureaucratic mass
  strengthened the liberals in order to hold down the
  revolutionary masses. . . . In any case our sole adversary
  on the day of the crisis and on the day after the crisis
  will be the whole of the reaction which will group
  around pure democracy, and this, I think, should not be
  lost sight of.”

  Our approach must differ from that of the theoreticians. The
  whole reactionary mass, not only bourgeois, but also feudal,
  groups itself around “pure democracy”. The
  German comrades know better than anyone else what
  “pure democracy” means, for Kautsky and the
  other leaders of the Second and the Two-and-a-Half
  Internationals are defending this “pure
  democracy” from the wicked Bolsheviks. If we judge the
  Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, not by
  what they say, but by what they do, we shall find that they
  are nothing but representatives of petty bourgeois
  “pure democracy”. In the course of our
  revolution they have given us a classic example of what
  “pure democracy” means, and again during the
  recent crisis, in the days of the Kronstadt mutiny. There
  was serious unrest among the peasantry, and discontent was
  also rife among the workers. They were weary and
  exhausted. After all, there is a limit to human
  endurance. They had starved for three years, but you cannot
  go on starving for four or five years. Naturally, hunger has
  a tremendous influence on political activity. How did the
  Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks  behave? They
  wavered all the time, thereby strengthening the
  bourgeoisie. The organisation of all the Russian parties
  abroad has revealed the present state of affairs. The
  shrewdest of the leaders of the Russian big bourgeoisie said
  to themselves: “We cannot achieve victory in Russia
  immediately. Hence our slogan must be: ‘Soviets
  without the Bolsheviks.’” Milyukov, the leader
  of the Constitutional-Democrats, defended the Soviet power
  from the attacks of the Socialist-Revolutionaries. This
  sounds very strange; but such are the practical dialectics
  which we, in our revolution, have been studying in a
  peculiar way, from the practical experience of our struggle
  and of the struggle of our enemies. The
  Constitutional-Democrats defend “Soviets without the
  Bolsheviks” because they understand the position very
  well and hope that a section of the people will rise to the
  bait. That is what the clever Constitutional-Democrats
  say. Not all the Constitutional-Democrats are clever, of
  course, but some of them are, and these have learned
  something from the French Revolution. The present slogan is
  to fight the Bolsheviks, whatever the price, come what
  may. The whole of the bourgeoisie is now helping the
  Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are now the
  vanguard of all reaction. In the spring we had a taste of
  the fruits  of this counter-revolutionary co-operation. [20]

  That is why we must continue our relentless struggle against
  these elements. Dictatorship is a state of intense war. That
  is just the state we are in. There is no military invasion
  at present; but we are isolated. On the other hand, however,
  we are not entirely isolated, since the whole international
  bourgeoisie is incapable of waging open war against us just
  now, because the whole working class, even though the
  majority is not yet communist, is sufficiently
  class-conscious to prevent intervention. The bourgeoisie is
  compelled to reckon with the temper of the masses even
  though they have not yet entirely sided with communism. That
  is why the bourgeoisie cannot now start an offensive against
  us, although one is never ruled out. Until the final issue
  is decided, this awful state of war will continue. And we
  say: “A la guerre comme à la guerre ;
  we do not promise any freedom, or any democracy.” We
  tell the peasants quite openly that they must choose between
  the rule of the  bourgeoisie, and the rule of the
  Bolsheviks—in which case we shall make every possible
  concession within the limits of retaining power, and later
  we shall lead them to socialism. Everything else is
  deception and pure demagogy. Ruthless war must be declared
  against this deception and demagogy. Our point of view is:
  for the time being—big concessions and the greatest
  caution, precisely because a certain equilibrium has set in,
  precisely because we are weaker than our combined enemies,
  and because our economic basis is too weak and we need a
  stronger one.

  That, comrades, is what I wanted to tell you about our
  tactics, the tactics of the Russian Communist
  Party. (Prolonged applause.)

[1] The Third
  Congress was held in Moscow from June 22 to July 12,
  1921. Its 605 delegates (291 with voice and vote, and 314
  with voice only) represented 103 organisations from 52
  countries, namely: 48 Communist Parties, 8 Socialist
  Parties, 28 Youth Leagues, 4 syndicalist organisations, 2
  opposition Communist Parties (the Communist Workers’
  Party of Gemany and the Workers’ Communist Party of
  Spain) and 13 other organisations. The 72 delegates from the
  Russian Communist Party of Bolsheviks were headed by
  Lenin.

  The Congress discussed the world economic crisis and the new
  tasks of the Communist International; the report on the
  activity of the Executive Committee of the Communist
  International; the Communist Workers’ Party of
  Germany, the Italian question; the tactics of the Communist
  International the attitude of the Red International Council
  of Trade Unions to the Communist International; the struggle
  against the Amsterdam International; the tactics of the
  R.C.P.(B.); the Communist International and the Communist
  youth movement; the women’s movement; the United
  Communist Party of Germany, etc.

  Lenin directed preparations for and the activities of the
  Congress; he was elected its Honorary Chairman; he took part
  in drafting all the key resolutions; he gave a report on the
  tactics of the R.C.P.(B.); he spoke in defence of the
  Communist International’s tactics, on the Italian
  question; in the commissions and at the enlarged sittings of
  the Executive Committee of the Comintern, and at the
  delegates’ meetings. Before and during the Congress,
  Lenin met and talked with delegates about the state of
  affairs in the Communist Parties.

  The Third Congress had a great influence on the formation
  and development of young Communist Parties. It paid great
  attention to the Comintern’s organisation and tactics
  in the new conditions of the world communist movement. Lenin
  had to combat the Centrist deviation and
  “Leftist” dogmatism, pseudo-revolutionary
  “Leftist” cant and sectarianism. As a result,
  revolutionary Marxism prevailed over the
  “Leftist” danger.

  In the history of the world communist movement the Third
  Congress is known for the following achievements: it worked
  out the basic tactics of the Communist Parties; it defined
  the task of winning the masses over to the side of the
  proletariat, strengthening working-class unity and
  implementing united front tactics. The most important aspect
  of its resolutions, Lenin said, was “more careful,
  more thorough preparation for fresh and more decisive
  battles, both defensive and offensive”.

[2]  On April 13,
  1919, in Amritsar, an industrial centre in Punjab, India,
  British troops fired on a mass meeting of working people who
  were protesting against the colonialist reign of
  terror. About 1,000 were killed and 2,000 wounded. The
  massacre led to popular uprisings in Punjab and other
  provinces, which were ruthlessly suppressed by the British
  colonialists.

[3] Posledniye
  Novosti (The Latest News )—an
  émigré daily, the organ of the
  counter-revolutionary party of Constitutional-Democrats,
  published in Paris from April 1920 to July 1940. Its editor
  was P. N. Milyukov.

[4]
Kommunistichesky Trud (Communist Labour
  )—a daily published by the Moscow R.C.P.(B.)
  Committee and the Moscow Soviet of Workers’ and
  Peasants’ Deputies from March 18, 1920. On February 7,
  1922, it took the name of Rabochaya Moskva
  (Workers’ Moscow ); on March 1, 1939,
  Moskovsky Bolshevik (Moscow Bolshevik ),
  and ever since February 19, 1950, has been appearing as
  Moskovskaya Pravda (Moscow Truth ).

[5] La
  Stampa (Press )—an Italian bourgeois
  newspaper published in Turin since 1867.

[6] Corriere
  della Sera (Evening Courier )—an
  innuential Italian bourgeois newspaper published in Milan
  since 1876. 

[7]The conference
  of the reformist wing of the Italian Socialist Party, the
  so-called “socialist concentration” group, took
  place in Reggio Emilia on October 10-11, 1920. Lenin gave a
  detailed characteristic of it in his article, “On the
  Struggle Within the Italian Socialist Party”
  (Collected Works, Vol. 31, pp. 377-96).

  The report on the conference mentioned by Lenin was
  published in Corriere della Sera No. 244 and
  No. 245, of October 11 and 12, 1920, as well as in
  Avanti! No. 245 of October 13, 1920.

[8]
Avanti! (Forward! )—a daily, the
  Central Organ of the Italian Socialist Party, founded in
  Rome in December 1896. During the First World War, it took
  an inconsistently internationalist stand, and did not break
  with the reformists. In 1926, the paper was closed down by
  Mussolini’s fascist government, but continued to
  appear abroad. It resumed publication in Italy in 1943.

[9] Lenin
  apparently refers to the conference of the
  “unitary” group (Serrati, Baratono and others)
  in Florence on November 20-21, 1920 which came out against
  the break with the reformists and, with this reservation,
  for the acceptance of the 21 conditions of affiliation to
  the Communist International.

[10] In January
  1919, the Ebert-Scheidemann government dismissed the Berlin
  police chief, Eichhorn (a Left-wing Independent) who was
  very popular with the workers. This sparked off a
  workers’ protest demonstration on January 4, the day
  following Eichhorn’s retirement, and later a general
  strike and an armed uprising to overthrow the
  Ebert-Scheidemann government. The Revolutionary Committee of
  Action which headed the uprising included some Independents
  and Karl Liebknecht and Wilhelm Pieck of the Communist Party
  of Germany. The Communist Party considered the uprising
  premature, but decided to support the revolutionary mass
  movement in every way. Berlin events fired the
  proletariat’s revolutionary struggle in the Rheinland,
  the Ruhr, Bremen and elsewhere.

  Alarmed by the scope of the movement, the Central Committee
  of the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany
  started negotiations with the government, who used them for
  preparing a counter-revolutionary offensive. On January 11,
  its forces, led by Noske, attacked the workers and drowned
  their uprising in blood. Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg,
  the leaders of the German working class, were arrested and
  killed at the height of the counter-revolutionary reign of
  terror. Workers’ action in other parts of the country
  was fiereely suppressed. 

[11] In September
  1920, Italian steelworkers occupied their mills on the
  initiative of their trade union, which was in conflict with
  the association of industrialists. The movement started in
  Turin and Milan, then spread through Piedmont and Northern
  Italy across the eountry, from the metallurgical industry to
  other industries and to agriculture. In Sicily and in other
  areas peasants occupied the land. The scope of the movement
  jeopardised the capitalist regime, but the reformist leaders
  of the Socialist Party and the trade unions, terrified by
  the political character of the movement, adopted a decision
  to confine it to within the trade unions and prevent it from
  developing into a revolution. They also decided to start
  negotiations with the industrialists.

  This was a hard blow at the Italian workers’ movement
  and showed the leaders’ inability to lead the mass
  forces. Fascism used the confusion within the working class
  to start its armed offensive in Italy.

[12] The
  amendments were proposed by the German, Austrian and Italian
  delegations to the draft theses on tactics, motioned by the
  Russian delegation at the Third Congress of the Comintern.
  They were published in German in Moskau, the organ
  of the Third Congress.

[13] The Open
  Letter (Offenor Brief) of the Central Committee of the
  United Communist Party of Germany to the Socialist Party of
  Germany, Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, the
  Communist Workers’ Party of Germany and all trade
  unions, was published in Die Rote Fahne (The
  Red Banner ) on January 8, 1921. The U.C.P.G. called on
  all workers, trade unions and socialist organisations to
  unite their forces in combating reaction and the
  capitalists’ offensive against the working
  people’s vital rights. Their programme of joint action
  included demands for higher pensions for disabled war
  veterans; elimination of unemployment; improvement of the
  country’s finances at the expense of the monopolies,
  introduction of factory and plant committee control over all
  stocks of food, raw materials and fuel restarting of all
  closed enterprises; control over sowing, harvesting and
  marketing of farm produce by the Peasants’ Councils
  together with the agricultural labourers’
  organisations; immediate disarming and dissolution of all
  bourgeois militarised organisations; establishment of
  workers’ self-defence; amnesty of all political
  prisoners; immediate re-establishment of trade and
  diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. Lenin said these
  tactics were “quite correct” (see
  Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, p. 221).

  The Right-wing leaders of the organisations to whom the Open
  Letter was addressed rejected the proposal for joint action
  with the Communists, despite the fact that the workers came
  out for a united front of the proletariat.

[14] The
  theory of an offensive struggle or “theory of
  the offensive” was proclaimed at the Unity Congress of
  the Communist Party of Germany and the Left-wing Independent
  Social-Democratic Party of Germany in December 1920. It
  envisaged that the party should conduct offensive tactics,
  regardless of whether there were any objective conditions
  for revolutionary activity or whether the working people
  supported the Communist Party. The theory found its
  followers among the “Leftists” in Hungary,
  Czechoslovakia, Italy, Austria, and France, and was one of
  the causes of the defeat of the March 1921 uprising in
  Germany. But the “Left ists” tried to justify
  the mistakes of the Central Committee of the U.C.P.G. The
  theses on the March uprising adopted by the U.C.P.G. Central
  Committee on April 8, 1921, reiterated that the U.C.P.G. was
  always to “follow the line of revolutionary
  offensive” and that offensive tactics, “even
  when unsuccessful, were a prerequisite of future victory and
  the only means for a revolutionary party to win over the
  masses”. At the Third Congress of the Comintern the
  followers of this theory fought to make it the basis of the
  Communist International’s resolutions on
  tactics. Lenin proved this theory to be wrong and
  adventurous, and the Congress approved his line of patient
  preparation and winning over of the majority of the working
  class to the side of the communist movement.

[17] On May 26,
  1921, in Vladivostok, the whiteguards, supported by the
  Japanese interventionists, overthrew the Maritime Regional
  Administration of the Far Eastern Republic and established a
  regime of bourgeois dictatorship and terror headed by
  industrialists, the Merkulov brothers. South Primorye became
  a spring-board for continued imperialist intervention in the
  Far East.

  The Revolutionary People’s Army of the Far Eastern
  Republic, under V. K. Blyukher, and later I. P. Uborevich,
  defeated the whiteguards, liberating Khabarovsk on February
  14, 1922, and Vladivostok on October 25, 1922. Japan had to
  withdraw her forces from the Far East. On November 14, 1922,
  the People’s Assembly of the Far Eastern Republic set
  up the Far East Revolutionary Committee with plenipotentiary
  powers to implement the union of the Far East with Soviet
  Russia. On November 15, 1922, the Presidium of the
  All-Russia Central Executive Committee issued a decree
  proclaiming the Far Eastern Republic an inseparable part of
  the R.S.F.S.R.

[18] The
  Csechoslovak Social-Democratic Party (Left) Congress held in
  Prague from May 14 to 16, 1921, was the Inaugural Congress
  of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. It was attended by
  569 delegates representing more than 350,000 Party
  members. The Congress adopted a resolution by acclamation on
  affiliation to the Third International. B. Smeral was the

      The fourth anniversary of October 25 (November 7) is
      approaching. 

      The farther that great day recedes from us, the more clearly we
      see the significance of the proletarian revolution in Russia,
      and the more deeply we reflect upon the practical experience of
      our work as a whole. 

      Very briefly and, of course, in very incomplete and rough
      outline, this significance and experience may be summed up as
      follows. 

      The direct and immediate object of the revolution in Russia was
      a bourgeois-democratic one, namely, to destroy the survivals of
      medievalism and sweep them away completely, to purge Russia of
      this barbarism, of this shame, and to remove this immense
      obstacle to all culture and progress in our country. 

      And we can justifiably pride ourselves on having carried out
      that purge with greater determination and much more rapidly,
      boldly and successfully, and, from the point of view of its
      effect on the masses, much more widely and deeply, than the
      great French Revolution over one hundred and twenty-five years
      ago. 

      Both the anarchists and the petty-bourgeois democrats (i.e., the
      Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are the
      Russian counterparts of that international social type) have
      talked and are still talking an incredible lot of nonsense about
      the relation between the bourgeois-democratic revolution and the
      socialist (that is, proletarian) revolution. The last
      four years have proved to the hilt that our interpretation of
      Marxism on this point, and our estimate of the experience of
      former revolutions were correct. We have consummated
      the bourgeois-democratic revolution as nobody had done
      before. We are advancing towards the socialist
      revolution consciously, firmly and unswervingly, knowing that it
      is not separated from the bourgeois-democratic revolution by a
      Chinese Wall, and knowing too that (in the last analysis)
      struggle alone will determine how far we shall advance,
      what part of this immense and lofty task we shall accomplish,
      and to what extent we shall succeed in consolidating our
      victories. Time will show. But we see even now that a tremendous
      amount—tremendous for this ruined, exhausted and backward
      country—has already been done towards the socialist
      transformation of society. 

      Let us, however, finish what we have to say about the
      bourgeois-democratic content of our revolution. Marxists must
      understand what that means. To explain, let us take a few
      striking examples. 

      The bourgeois-democratic content of the revolution means that
      the social relations (system, institutions) of the country are
      purged of medievalism, serfdom, feudalism. 

      What were the chief manifestations, survivals, remnants of
      serfdom in Russia up to 1917? The monarchy, the system of social
      estates, landed proprietorship and land tenure, the status of
      women, religion, and national oppression. Take any one of these
      Augean stables, which, incidentally, were left largely
      uncleansed by all the more advanced states when they
      accomplished their bourgeois-democratic revolutions one
      hundred and twenty-five, two hundred and fifty and more years
      ago (1649 in England); take any of these Augean stables, and you
      will see that we have cleansed them thoroughly. In a matter of
      ten weeks, from October 25 (November 7), 1917 to
      January 5, 1918, when the Constituent Assembly was dissolved, we
      accomplished a thousand times more in this respect than was
      accomplished by the bourgeois democrats and liberals (the
      Cadets) and by the petty-bourgeois democrats (the Mensheviks and
      the Socialist-Revolutionaries) during the eight months
      they were in power. 

      Those poltroons, gas-bags, vainglorious Narcissuses and petty
      Hamlets brandished their wooden swords—but did not even
      destroy the monarchy! We cleansed out all that monarchist muck
      as nobody had ever done before. We left not a stone, not a brick
      of that ancient edifice, the social-estate system even the most
      advanced countries, such as Britain, France and Germany, have
      not completely eliminated the survivals of that system to this
      day!), standing. We tore out the deep-seated roots of the
      social-estate system, namely, the remnants of feudalism and
      serfdom in the system of landownership, to the last. “One
      may argue” (there are plenty of quill-drivers, Cadets,
      Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries abroad to indulge in
      such arguments) as to what “in the long run” will be
      the outcome of the agrarian reform effected by the Great October
      Revolution. We have no desire at the moment to waste time on
      such controversies, for we are deciding this, as well as the
      mass of accompanying controversies, by struggle. But the fact
      cannot be denied that the petty-bourgeois democrats
      “compromised” with the landowners, the custodians of
      the traditions of serfdom, for eight months, while we completely
      swept the landowners and all their traditions from Russian soil
      in a few weeks. 

      Take religion, or the denial of rights to women, or the
      oppression and inequality of the non-Russian
      nationalities. These are all problems of the
      bourgeois-democratic revolution. The vulgar petty-bourgeois
      democrats talked about them for eight months. In not a
      single one of the most advanced countries in the world
      have these questions been completely settled on
      bourgeois-democratic lines. In our country they have
      been settled completely by the legislation of the October
      Revolution. We have fought and are fighting religion in
      earnest. We have granted all the non-Russian
      nationalities their own republics or autonomous
      regions. We in Russia no longer have the base, mean and infamous
      denial of rights to women or inequality of the sexes, that
      disgusting survival of feudalism and medievalism, which is being
      renovated by the avaricious bourgeoisie and the dull-witted and
      frightened petty bourgeoisie in every other country in the world
      without exception. 

      All this goes to make up the content of the bourgeois-democratic
      revolution. A hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty years
      ago the progressive leaders of that revolution (or of those
      revolutions, if we consider each national variety of the one
      general type) promised to rid mankind of medieval privileges, of
      sex inequality, of state privileges for one religion or another
      (or “religious ideas ”, “the
      church” in general), and of national inequality. They
      promised, but did not keep their promises. They could not keep
      them, for they were hindered by their
      “respect”— for the “sacred right of
      private property”. Our proletarian revolution was not
      afflicted with this accursed “respect” for this
      thrice-accursed medievalism and for the “sacred right of
      private property”. 

      But in order to consolidate the achievements of the
      bourgeois-democratic revolution for the peoples of Russia, we
      were obliged to go farther; and we did go farther. We solved the
      problems of the bourgeois-democratic revolution in passing, as a
      “by-product” of our main and genuinely
      proletarian -revolutionary, socialist activities. We
      have always said that reforms are a by-product of the
      revolutionary class struggle. We said—and proved it by
      deeds—that bourgeois-democratic reforms are a by-product
      of the proletarian, i.e., of the socialist
      revolution. Incidentally, the Kautskys, Hilferdings, Martovs,
      Chernovs, Hillquits, Longuets, MacDonalds, Turatis and other
      heroes of “Two and-a-Half” Marxism were incapable of
      understanding this relation between the bourgeois-democratic and
      the proletarian-socialist revolutions. The first develops into
      the second. The second, in passing, solves the problems of the
      first. The second consolidates the work of the first. Struggle,
      and struggle alone, decides how far the second succeeds in
      outgrowing the first. 

      The Soviet system is one of the most vivid proofs, or
      manifestations, of how the one revolution develops into the
      other. The Soviet system provides the maximum of democracy for
      the workers and peasants; at the same time, it marks a break
      with bourgeois democracy and the rise of a new,
      epoch-making type of democracy, namely, proletarian
      democracy, or the dictatorship of the proletariat. 

      Let the curs and swine of the moribund bourgeoisie and of the
      petty-bourgeois democrats who trail behind them heap
      imprecations, abuse and derision upon our heads for our reverses
      and mistakes in the work of building up our Soviet system. We do
      not forget for a moment that we have committed and are
      committing numerous mistakes and are suffering numerous
      reverses. How can reverses and mistakes be avoided in a matter
      so new in the history of the world as the building of an
      unprecedented type of state edifice! We shall work
      steadfastly to set our reverses and mistakes right and to
      improve our practical application of Soviet principles, which is
      still very, very far from being perfect. But we have a right to
      be and are proud that to us has fallen the good fortune to
      begin the building of a Soviet state, and thereby to
      usher in a new era in world history, the era of the
      rule of a new class, a class which is oppressed in
      every capitalist country, but which everywhere is marching
      forward towards a new life, towards victory over the
      bourgeoisie, towards the dictatorship of the proletariat,
      towards the emancipation of mankind from the yoke of capital and
      from imperialist wars. 

      The question of imperialist wars, of the international policy of
      finance capital which now dominates the whole world, a policy
      that must inevitably engender new imperialist wars,
      that must inevitably cause an extreme intensification of
      national oppression, pillage, brigandry and the strangulation of
      weak, backward and small nationalities by a handful of
      “advanced” powers—that question has been the
      keystone of all policy in all the countries of the globe since
      1914. It is a question of life and death for millions upon
      millions of people. It is a question of whether 20,000,000
      people (as compared with the 10,000,000 who were killed in the
      war of 1914-18 and in the supplementary “minor” wars
      that are still going on) are to be slaughtered in the next
      imperialist war, which the bourgeoisie are preparing, and which
      is growing out of capitalism before our very eyes. It is a
      question of whether in that future war, which is inevitable (if
      capitalism continues to exist), 60,000,000 people are to be
      maimed (compared with the 30,000,000 maimed in 1914-18). In this
      question, too, our October Revolution marked the beginning of a
      new era in world history. The lackeys of the bourgeoisie and its
      yes-men—the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks,
      and the petty-bourgeois, allegedly “socialist”,
      democrats all over the world—derided our slogan
      “convert the imperialist war into a civil war”. But
      that slogan proved to be the truth—it was the
      only truth, unpleasant, blunt, naked and brutal, but
      nevertheless the truth, as against the host of most
      refined jingoist and pacifist lies. Those lies are being
      dispelled. The Brest peace has been exposed. And with every
      passing day the significance and consequences of a peace that is
      even worse than the Brest peace—the peace of
      Versailles—are being more relentlessly exposed. And the
      millions who are thinking about the causes of the recent war and
      of the approaching future war are more and more clearly
      realising the grim and inexorable truth that it is impossible to
      escape imperialist war, and imperialist peace (if the old
      orthography were still in use, I would have written the word
      mir in two ways, to give it both its meanings)[In Russian, the word mir has two
      meanings (world and peace) and had two different spellings in
      the old orthography.—Translator] which
      inevitably engenders imperialist war, that it is impossible to
      escape that inferno, except by a Bolshevik struggle and a
      Bolshevik revolution. 

      Let the bourgeoisie and the pacifists, the generals and the
      petty bourgeoisie, the capitalists and the philistines, the
      pious Christians and the knights of the Second and the
      Two-and-a-Half Internationals vent their fury against that
      revolution. No torrents of abuse, calumnies and lies can enable
      them to conceal the historic fact that for the first time in
      hundreds and thousands of years the slaves have replied to a war
      between slave-owners by openly proclaiming the slogan:
      “Convert this war between slave-owners for the division of
      their loot into a war of the slaves of all nations against the
      slave-owners of all nations.” 

      For the first time in hundreds and thousands of years that
      slogan has grown from a vague and helpless waiting into a clear
      and definite political programme, into an effective struggle
      waged by millions of oppressed people under the leadership of
      the proletariat; it has grown into the first victory of the
      proletariat, the first victory in the struggle to abolish war
      and to unite the workers of all countries against the united
      bourgeoisie of different nations, against the bourgeoisie that
      makes peace and war at the expense of the slaves of capital, the
      wage-workers, the peasants, the working people. 

      This first victory is not yet the final victory, and it
      was achieved by our October Revolution at the price of
      incredible difficulties and hardships, at the price of
      unprecedented suffering, accompanied by a series of serious
      reverses and mistakes on our part. How could a single backward
      people be expected to frustrate the imperialist wars of the most
      powerful and most developed countries of the world without
      sustaining reverses and without committing mistakes! We are not
      afraid to admit our mistakes and shall examine them
      dispassionately in order to learn how to correct them. But the
      fact remains that for the first time in hundreds and thousands
      of years the promise “to reply” to war between the
      slave-owners by a revolution of the slaves directed
      against all the slave-owners has been completely
      fulfilled—and is being fulfilled despite all
      difficulties.

      We have made the start. When, at what date and time, and the
      proletarians of which nation will complete this process is not
      important. The important thing is that the ice has been broken;
      the road is open, the way has been shown.

      Gentlemen, capitalists of all countries, keep up your
      hypocritical pretence of “defending the
      fatherland”—the Japanese fatherland against the
      American, the American against the Japanese, the French against
      the British, and so forth! Gentlemen, knights of the Second and
      Two-and a-Half Internationals, pacifist petty bourgeoisie and
      philistines of the entire world, go on “evading”
      the question of how to combat imperialist wars by issuing new
      “Basle Manifestos” (on the model of the Basle
      Manifesto of 1912[1]). The first Bolshevik
      revolution has wrested the first hundred million
      people of this earth from the clutches of imperialist war
      and the imperialist world. Subsequent revolutions will deliver
      the rest of mankind from such wars and from such a world. 

      Our last, but most important and most difficult task, the one we
      have done least about, is economic development, the laying of
      economic foundations for the new, socialist edifice on the site
      of the demolished feudal edifice and the semi-demolished
      capitalist edifice. It is in this most important and most
      difficult task that we have sustained the greatest number of
      reverses and have made most mistakes. How could anyone expect
      that a task so new to the world could be begun without reverses
      and without mistakes! But we have begun it. We shall continue
      it. At this very moment we are, by our New Economic Policy,
      correcting a number of our mistakes. We are learning how to
      continue erecting the socialist edifice in a small-peasant
      country without committing such mistakes. 

      The difficulties are immense. But we are accustomed to grappling
      with immense difficulties. Not for nothing do our enemies call
      us “stone-hard” and exponents of a “firm line
      policy”. But we have also learned, at least to some
      extent, another art that is essential in revolution, namely,
      flexibility, the ability to effect swift and sudden changes of
      tactics if changes in objective conditions demand them, and to
      choose another path for the achievement of our goal if the
      former path proves to be inexpedient or impossible at the given
      moment. 

      Borne along on the crest of the wave of enthusiasm, rousing
      first the political enthusiasm and then the military enthusiasm
      of the people, we expected to accomplish economic tasks just as
      great as the political and military tasks we had accomplished by
      relying directly on this enthusiasm. We expected—or
      perhaps it would be truer to say that we presumed without having
      given it adequate consideration—to be able to organise the
      state production and the state distribution of products on
      communist lines in a small-peasant country directly as ordered
      by the proletarian state. Experience has proved that we were
      wrong. It appears that a number of transitional stages were
      necessary—state capitalism and socialism—in order to
      prepare—to prepare by many years of
      effort—for the transition to communism. Not directly
      relying on enthusiasm, but aided by the enthusiasm engendered by
      the great revolution, and on the basis of personal interest,
      personal incentive and business principles, we must first set to
      work in this small peasant country to build solid gangways to
      socialism by way of state capitalism. Otherwise we shall never
      get to communism, we shall never bring scores of millions of
      people to communism. That is what experience, the objective
      course of the development of the revolution, has taught us. 

      And we, who during these three or four years have learned a
      little to make abrupt changes of front (when abrupt changes of
      front are needed), have begun zealously, attentively and
      sedulously (although still not zealously, attentively and
      sedulously enough) to learn to make a new change of front,
      namely, the New Economic Policy. The proletarian state must
      become a cautious, assiduous and shrewd
      “businessman”, a punctilious wholesale
      merchant—otherwise it will never succeed in putting
      this small-peasant country economically on its feet. Under
      existing conditions, living as we are side by side with the
      capitalist (for the time being capitalist) West, there is no
      other way of progressing to communism. A wholesale merchant
      seems to be an economic type as remote from communism as heaven
      from earth. But that is one of the contradictions which, in
      actual life, lead from a small-peasant economy via state
      capitalism to socialism. Personal incentive will step up
      production; we must increase production first and foremost and
      at all costs. Wholesale trade economically unites millions of
      small peasants: it gives them a personal incentive, links them
      up and leads them to the next step, namely, to various forms of
      association and alliance in the process of production itself. We
      have already started the necessary changes in our economic
      policy and already have some successes to our credit; true, they
      are small and partial, but nonetheless they are successes. In
      this new field of “tuition” we are already finishing
      our preparatory class. By persistent and assiduous study, by
      making practical experience the test of every step we take, by
      not fearing to alter over and over again what we have already
      begun, by correcting our mistakes and most carefully analysing
      their significance, we shall pass to the higher classes. We
      shall go through the whole “course”, although the
      present state of world economics and world politics has made
      that course much longer and much more difficult than we would
      have liked. No matter at what cost, no matter how severe the
      hardships of the transition period may be—despite
      disaster, famine and ruin—we shall not flinch; we shall
      triumphantly carry our cause to its goal.

[1] The Extraordinary
      International Socialist Congress that sat in Basle on November
      24-25, 1912, adopted a manifesto on war, which warned the
      peoples that an imperialist world war was imminent, showed the
      predatory objectives of that war and called upon the workers of
      all countries to make a determined stand for peace. It included
      a point, contributed by Lenin to the resolution of the Stuttgart
      Congress of 1907, that if an imperialist war broke out the
      socialists should utilise the economic and political crisis
      stemming from it to accelerate the downfall of capitalist class
      domination and to work for a socialist revolution.

      The best way to celebrate the anniversary of a great revolution
      is to concentrate attention on its unsolved problems. It is
      particularly appropriate and necessary to celebrate the
      revolution in this way at a time when we are faced with
      fundamental problems that the revolution has not yet solved, and
      when we must master something new (from the point of view of
      what the revolution has accomplished up to now) for the solution
      of these problems.

      What is new for our revolution at the present time is the need
      for a “reformist”,  gradual, cautious and
      round-about approach to the solution of the fundamental problems
      of economic development. This “novelty” gives rise
      to a number of questions, perplexities and doubts in both theory
      and practice.

      A theoretical question. How can we explain the transition from a
      series of extremely revolutionary actions to extremely
      “reformist” actions in the same field at a time when
      the revolution as a whole is making victorious progress? Does it
      not imply a “surrender of positions”,  an
      “admission of defeat”,  or something of that sort?
      Of course, our enemies—from the semi-feudal type of
      reactionaries to the Mensheviks or other knights of the
      Two-and-a-Half International—say that it does. They would
      not be enemies if they did not shout something of the sort on
      every pretext, and even without any pretext. The touching
      unanimity that prevails on this question among all parties, from
      the feudal reactionaries to the Mensheviks, is only further
      proof that all these parties constitute “one reactionary
      mass” opposed to the proletarian revolution (as Engels
      foresaw in his letters to Bebel of 1875 and 1884—be it
      said in parenthesis).[1]

      But there is “perplexity”,  shall we say, among
      friends, too.

      Restore large-scale industry, organise the direct exchange of
      its goods for the produce of small-peasant farming, and thus
      assist the socialisation of the latter. For the purpose of
      restoring large-scale industry, borrow from the peasants a
      certain quantity of foodstuffs and raw materials by
      requisitioning—this was the plan (or method, system) that
      we followed for more than three years, up to the spring of
      1921. This was a revolutionary approach to the problem—to
      break up the old social-economic system completely at one stroke
      and to substitute a new one for it.

      Since the spring of 1921, instead of this approach, plan,
      method, or mode of action, we have been adopting (we have not
      yet “adopted” but are still “adopting”,
      and have not yet fully realised it) a totally different method,
      a reformist type of method: not to break up the old
      social economic system—trade, petty production, petty
      proprietorship, capitalism—but to revive trade,
      petty proprietorship, capitalism, while cautiously and gradually
      getting the upper hand over them, or making it possible to
      subject them to state regulation only to the extent
      that they revive.

      That is an entirely different approach to the problem.

      Compared with the previous, revolutionary, approach, it is a
      reformist approach (revolution is a change which breaks the old
      order to its very foundations, and not one that cautiously,
      slowly and gradually remodels it, taking care to break as little
      as possible).

      The question that arises is this. If, after trying revolutionary
      methods, you find they have failed and adopt reformist methods,
      does it not prove that you are declaring the revolution to have
      been a mistake in general? Does it not prove that you should not
      have started with the revolution but should have started with
      reforms and confined yourselves to them?

      That is the conclusion which the Mensheviks and others like them
      have drawn. But this conclusion is either sophistry, a mere
      fraud perpetrated by case-hardened politicians, or it is the
      childishness of political tyros. The greatest, perhaps the only
      danger to the genuine revolutionary is that of exaggerated
      revolutionism, ignoring the limits and conditions in which
      revolutionary methods are appropriate and can be successfully
      employed. True revolutionaries have mostly come a cropper when
      they began to write “revolution” with a capital R,
      to elevate “revolution” to something almost divine,
      to lose their heads, to lose the ability to reflect, weigh and
      ascertain in the coolest and most dispassionate manner at what
      moment, under what circumstances and in which sphere of action
      you must act in a revolutionary manner, and at what moment,
      under what circumstances and in which sphere you must turn to
      reformist action. True revolutionaries will perish (not that
      they will be defeated from outside, but that their work will
      suffer internal collapse) only if they abandon their sober
      outlook and take it into their heads that the “great,
      victorious, world” revolution can and must solve all
      problems in a revolutionary manner under all circumstances and
      in all spheres of action. If they do this, their doom is
      certain.

      Whoever gets such ideas into his head is lost because he has
      foolish ideas about a fundamental problem; and in a fierce war
      (and revolution is the fiercest sort of war) the penalty for
      folly is defeat.

      What grounds are there for assuming that the “great,
      victorious, world” revolution can and must employ only
      revolutionary methods? There are none at all. The assumption is
      a pure fallacy; this can be proved by purely theoretical
      propositions if we stick to Marxism. The experience of our
      revolution also shows that it is a fallacy. From
      the theoretical point of view—foolish things are done in
      time of revolution just as at any other time, said Engels,[2] and he was right. We must try to do
      as few foolish things as possible, and rectify those that are
      done as quickly as possible, and we must, as soberly as we can,
      estimate which problems can be solved by revolutionary methods
      at any given time and which cannot. From the point of view of
      our practical experience the Brest peace was an example of
      action that was not revolutionary at all; it was reformist, and
      even worse, because it was a retreat, whereas, as a general
      rule, reformist action advances slowly, cautiously, gradually,
      and does not move backward. The proof that our tactics in
      concluding the Brest peace were correct is now so complete, so
      obvious to all and generally admitted, that there is no need to
      say any more about it.

      Our revolution has completed only its bourgeois-democratic work;
      and we have every right to be proud of this. The proletarian or
      socialist part of its work may be summed up in three main
      points: (1) The revolutionary withdrawal from the imperialist
      world war; the exposure and halting of the slaughter
      organised by the two world groups of capitalist
      predators—for our part we have done this in full; others
      could have done it only if there had been a revolution in a
      number of advanced countries. (2) The establishment of the
      Soviet system, as a form of the dictatorship of the
      proletariat. An epoch-making change has been made. The era of
      bourgeois-democratic parliamentarism has come to an end. A new
      chapter in world history—the era of proletarian
      dictatorship—has been opened. The Soviet system and all
      forms of proletarian dictatorship will have the finishing
      touches put to them and be completed only by the efforts of a
      number of countries. There is still a great deal we have not
      done in this field. It would be unpardonable to lose sight of
      this. Again and again we shall have to improve the work, redo
      it, start from the beginning. Every step onward and upward that
      we take in developing our productive forces and our culture must
      be accompanied by the work of improving and altering our Soviet
      system—we are still low in the scale of economics and
      culture. Much will have to be altered, and to be
      “embarrassed” by this would be absurd (if not
      worse). (3) The creation of the economic basis of the socialist
      system; the main features of what is most important, most
      fundamental, have not yet been completed. This, however, is our
      soundest basis, soundest from the point of view of principle and
      from the practical point of view, from the point of view of the
      R.S.F.S.R. today and from the international point of view.

      Since the main features of this basis have not yet been
      completed we must concentrate all our attention upon it. The
      difficulty here lies in the form of the transition.

      In April 1918, in my Immediate The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet
      Government,  I wrote:

      “It is not enough to be a revolutionary and an adherent of
      socialism or a Communist in general. You must be able at each
      particular moment to find the particular link in the chain which
      you must grasp with all your might in order to hold the whole
      chain and to prepare firmly for the transition to the next link;
      the order of the links, their form, the manner in which they are
      linked together, their difference from each other in the
      historical chain of events are not as simple and not as
      senseless as those in an ordinary chain made by a
      smith.”

      At the present time, in the sphere of activity with which we are
      dealing, this link is the revival of home trade under
      proper state regulation (direction). Trade is the
      “link” in the historical chain of events, in the
      transitional forms of our socialist construction in 1921-22,
      which we, the proletarian government, we, the ruling Communist
      Party, “must grasp with all our might ”.
      If we “grasp” this link firmly enough now
      we shall certainly control the whole chain in the very
      near future. If we do not, we shall not control the whole chain,
      we shall not create the foundation for socialist social and
      economic relations.

      Communism and trade?! It sounds strange. The two seem to be
      unconnected, incongruous, poles apart. But if we study it from
      the point of view of economics, we shall find that the
      one is no more remote from the other than communism is from
      small-peasant, patriarchal farming.

      When we are victorious on a world scale I think we shall use
      gold for the purpose of building public lavatories in the
      streets of some of the largest cities of the world. This would
      be the most “just” and most educational way of
      utilising gold for the benefit of these generations which have
      not forgotten how, for the sake of gold, ten million men were
      killed and thirty million maimed in the “great war for
      freedom”,  the war of 1914-18, the war that was waged to
      decide the great question of which peace was the worst, that of
      Brest or that of Versailles; and how, for the sake of this same
      gold, they certainly intend to kill twenty million men and to
      maim sixty million in a war, say, in 1925, or 1928, between,
      say, Japan and the U.S.A., or between Britain and the U.S.A., or
      something like that.

      But however “just”,  useful, or humane it would be
      to utilise gold for this purpose, we nevertheless say that we
      must work for another decade or two with the same intensity and
      with the same success as in the 1917-21 period, only in a much
      wider field, in order to reach this state. Meanwhile, we must
      save the gold in the R.S.F.S.R., sell it at the highest price,
      buy goods with it at the lowest price. When you live among
      wolves, you must howl like a wolf, while as for exterminating
      all the wolves, as should be done in a rational human society,
      we shall act up to the wise Russian proverb: “Boast not
      before but after the battle”. 

      Trade is the only possible economic link between the scores of
      millions of small farmers and large-scale industry if
      . . . if there is not alongside these farmers an
      excellently equipped large-scale machine industry with a network
      of power transmission lines, an industry whose technical
      equipment, organisational “superstructures” and
      other features are sufficient to enable it to supply the small
      farmers with the best goods in larger quantities, more quickly
      and more cheaply than before. On a world scale this
      “if” has already been achieved, this
      condition already exists. But the country, formerly one of the
      most backward capitalist countries, which tried alone directly
      and at one stroke to create, to put into use, to organise
      practically the new links between industry and
      agriculture, failed to achieve this task by “direct
      assault”,  and must now try to achieve it by a number of
      slow, gradual, and cautious “siege” operations.

      The proletarian government can control trade, direct it into
      definite channels, keep it within certain limits. I shall give a
      small, a very small example. In the Donets Basin a slight, still
      very slight, but undoubted revival in the economy has commenced,
      partly due to a rise in the productivity of labour at the large
      state mines, and partly due to the leasing of small mines to
      peasants. As a result, the proletarian government is receiving a
      small additional quantity (a miserably small quantity compared
      with what is obtained in the advanced countries, but an
      appreciable quantity considering our poverty-stricken condition)
      of coal at a cost of, say, 100; and it is selling this coal to
      various government departments at a price of, say, 120, and to
      private individuals at a price of, say, 140. (I must say in
      parenthesis that my figures are quite arbitrary, first because I
      do not know the exact figures, and, secondly, I would not now
      make them public even if I did.) This looks as if we are
      beginning, if only in very modest dimensions, to
      control exchange between industry and agriculture, to
      control wholesale trade, to cope with the task of taking in hand
      the available, small, backward industry, or large-scale but
      weakened and ruined industry; of reviving trade on the
      present economic basis; of making the ordinary middle
      peasant (and that is the typical peasant, the peasant in the
      mass, the true representative of the petty-bourgeois milieu)
      feel the benefit of the economic revival; of taking advantage of
      it for the purpose of more systematically and persistently, more
      widely and successfully restoring large-scale industry.

      We shall not surrender to “sentimental socialism”,
      or to the old Russian, semi-aristocratic, semi-muzhik and
      patriarchal mood, with their supreme contempt for trade. We can
      use, and, since it is necessary, we must learn to use,
      all transitional economic forms for the purpose of strengthening
      the link between the peasantry and the proletariat, for the
      purpose of immediately reviving the economy of our ruined and
      tormented country, of improving industry, and facilitating such
      future, more extensive and more deep-going, measures as
      electrification.

      Marxism alone has precisely and correctly defined the relation
      of reforms to revolution, although Marx was able to see this
      relation only from one aspect—under the conditions
      preceding the first to any extent permanent and lasting victory
      of the proletariat, if only in one country. Under those
      conditions, the basis of the proper relation was that reforms
      are a by-product of the revolutionary class struggle of the
      proletariat. Throughout the capitalist world this relation is
      the foundation of the revolutionary tactics of the
      proletariat—the ABC, which is being distorted and obscured
      by the corrupt leaders of the Second International and the
      half-pedantic and half-finicky knights of the Two-and-a-Half
      International. After the victory of the proletariat, if only in
      one country, something new enters into the relation between
      reforms and revolution. In principle, it is the same as before,
      but a change in form takes place, which Marx himself could not
      foresee, but which can be appreciated only on the basis of the
      philosophy and politics of Marxism. Why were we able to carry
      out the Brest retreat successfully? Because we had advanced so
      far that we had room in which to retreat. At such dizzy speed,
      in a few weeks, from October 25, 1917, to the Brest peace, we
      built up the Soviet state, withdrew from the imperialist war in
      a revolutionary manner and completed the bourgeois-democratic
      revolution so that even the great backward movement (the Brest
      peace) left us sufficient room in which to take advantage of the
      “respite” and to march forward victoriously against
      Kolchak, Denikin, Yudenich, Pilsudski and Wrangel.

      Before the victory of the proletariat, reforms are a by product
      of the revolutionary class struggle. After the victory (while
      still remaining a “by-product” on an international
      scale) they are, in addition, for the country in which victory
      has been achieved, a necessary and legitimate breathing space
      when, after the utmost exertion of effort, it becomes obvious
      that sufficient strength is lacking for the revolutionary
      accomplishment of some transition or another. Victory creates
      such a “reserve of strength” that it is possible to
      hold out even in a forced retreat, hold out both materially and
      morally. Holding out materially means preserving a sufficient
      superiority of forces to prevent the enemy from inflicting utter
      defeat. Holding out morally means not allowing oneself to become
      demoralised and disorganised, keeping a sober view of the
      situation, preserving vigour and firmness of spirit, even
      retreating a long way, but not too far, and in such a way as to
      stop the retreat in time and revert to the offensive.

      We retreated to state capitalism, but we did not retreat too
      far. We are now retreating to the state regulation of trade, but
      we shall not retreat too far. There are visible signs that the
      retreat is coming to an end; there are signs that we shall be
      able to stop this retreat in the not too distant future. The
      more conscious, the more unanimous, the more free from prejudice
      we are in carrying out this necessary retreat, the sooner shall
      we be able to stop it, and the more lasting, speedy and
      extensive will be our subsequent victorious advance.

      1. The New Economic Policy And The Trade Unions

      The New Economic Policy introduces a number of important changes
      in the position of the proletariat and, consequently, in that of
      the trade unions. The great bulk of the means of production in
      industry and the transport system remains in the hands of the
      proletarian state. This, together with the nationalisation of
      the land, shows that the New Economic Policy does not change the
      nature of the workers’ state, although it does
      substantially alter the methods and forms of socialist
      development for it permits of economic rivalry between
      socialism, which is now being built, and capitalism, which is
      trying to revive by supplying the needs of the vast masses of
      the peasantry through the medium of the market. 

      Changes in the forms of socialist development are necessary
      because the Communist Party and the Soviet government are now
      adopting special methods to implement the general policy of
      transition from capitalism to socialism and in many respects are
      operating differently from the way they operated before: they
      are capturing a number of positions by a "new flanking
      movement", so to speak; they are retreating in order to make
      better preparations for a new offensive against capitalism. In
      particular, a free market and capitalism, both subject to state
      control, are now being permitted and are developing; on the
      other hand, the socialised state enterprises are being put on
      what is called a profit basis, i. e., they are being reorganised
      on commercial lines, which, in view of the general cultural
      backwardness and exhaustion of the country, will, to a greater
      or lesser degree, inevitably give rise to the impression among
      the masses that there is an antagonism of interest between the
      management of the different enterprises and the workers employed
      in them. 

    

      2. State Capitalism In The Proletarian State 
  And The Trade Unions

      The proletarian state may, without changing its own nature,
      permit freedom to trade and the development of capitalism only
      within certain bounds, and only on the condition that the state
      regulates (supervises, controls, determines the forms and
      methods of, etc.) private trade and private capitalism. The
      success of such regulation will depend not only on the state
      authorities but also, and to a larger extent, on the degree of
      maturity of the proletariat and of the masses of the working
      people generally, on their cultural level, etc. But even if this
      regulation is completely successful, the antagonism of class
      interests between labour and capital will certainly
      remain. Consequently, one of the main tasks that will henceforth
      confront the trade unions is to protect in every way the class
      interests of the proletariat in its struggle against
      capital. This task should be openly put in the forefront, and
      the machinery of the trade unions must be reorganised, changed
      or supplemented accordingly (conflict commissions, strike funds,
      mutual aid funds, etc., should be formed, or rather, built up). 



      3. The State Enterprises That Are Being Put On A Profit Basis
         And The Trade Unions

      The transfer of state enterprises to the so-called profit basis
      is inevitably and inseparably connected with the New Economic
      Policy; in the near future this is bound to become the
      predominant, if not the sole, form of state enterprise. In
      actual fact, this means that with the free market now permitted
      and developing the state enterprises will to a large extent be
      put on a commercial basis. In view of the urgent need to
      increase the productivity of labour and make every state
      enterprise pay its way and show a profit, and in view of the
      inevitable rise of narrow departmental interests and excessive
      departmental zeal, this circumstance is bound; to create a
      certain conflict of interests in matters concerning labour
      conditions between the masses of workers and the directors and
      managers of the state enterprises, or the government departments
      in charge of them. Therefore, as regards the socialised
      enterprises, it is undoubtedly the duty of the trade unions to
      protect the interests of the working people, to facilitate as
      far as possible the improvement of their standard of living, and
      constantly to correct the blunders and excesses of business
      organisations resulting from bureaucratic distortions of the
      state apparatus.

      4. The Essential Difference Between The Class Struggle Of The
         Proletariat In A State Which Recognises Private Ownership Of
         The Land, Factories, Etc., And Where Political Power Is In
         The Hands Of The Capitalist Class, And The Economic
         Struggle Of The Proletariat In A State Which Does Not
         Recognise Private Ownership Of The Land And The Majority Of
         The Large Enterprises And Where Political. Power Is In The
         Hands Of The Proletariat

      As long as classes exist, the class struggle is inevitable. In
      the period of transition from capitalism to socialism the
      existence of classes is inevitable; and the Programme of the
      Russian Communist Party definitely states that we are taking
      only the first steps in the transition from capitalism to
      socialism. Hence, the Communist Party, the Soviet government and
      the trade unions must frankly admit the existence of an economic
      struggle and its inevitability until the electrification of
      industry and agriculture is completed—at least in the
      main—and until small production and the supremacy of the
      market are thereby cut off at the roots. 

      On the other hand, it is obvious that under capitalism the
      ultimate object of the strike struggle is to break up the state
      machine and to overthrow the given class state power.

      Under the transitional type of proletarian state such as ours,
      however, the ultimate object of every action taken by the
      working class can only be to fortify the proletarian state and
      the state power of the proletarian class by combating the
      bureaucratic distortions, mistakes and flaws in this state, and
      by curbing the class appetites of the capitalists who try to
      evade its control, etc. Hence, the Communist Party, the Soviet
      government and the trade unions must never forget and must never
      conceal from the workers and the mass of the working people that
      the strike struggle in a state where the proletariat holds
      political power can be explained and justified only by the
      bureaucratic distortions of the proletarian state and by all
      sorts of survivals of the old capitalist system in the
      government offices on the one hand, and by the political
      immaturity and cultural backwardness of the mass of the working
      people on the other. 

      Hence, when friction and disputes arise between individual
      contingents of the working class and individual departments and
      organs of the workers’ state, the task of the trade unions
      is to facilitate the speediest and smoothest settlement of these
      disputes to the maximum advantage of the groups of workers they
      represent, taking care, however, not to prejudice the interests
      of other groups of workers and the development of the
      workers’ state and its economy as a whole; for only this
      development can lay the foundations for the material and
      cultural welfare of the working class. The only correct, sound
      and expedient method of removing friction and of settling
      disputes between individual contingents of the working class and
      the organs of the workers’ state is for the trade unions
      to act as mediators, and through their competent bodies either
      to enter into negotiations with the competent business
      organisations on the basis of precise demands and proposals
      formulated by both sides, or appeal to higher state bodies. 

      In cases where wrong actions of business organisations, the
      backwardness of certain sections of workers, the provocations of
      counter-revolutionary elements or, lastly, lack of foresight on
      the part of the trade union organisations themselves lead to
      open disputes in the form of strikes in state enterprises, and
      so forth, the task of the trade unions is to bring-about the
      speediest settlement of a dispute by taking measures in
      conformity with the general nature of trade union activities,
      that is, by taking steps to remove the real injustices and
      irregularities and to satisfy the lawful and practicable demands
      of the masses, by exercising political influence on the masses,
      and so forth. 

      One of the most important and infallible tests of the
      correctness and success of the activities of the trade unions is
      the degree to which they succeed in averting mass disputes in
      state enterprises by pursuing a far-sighted policy with a view
      to effectively protecting the interests of the masses of the
      workers in all respects and to removing in time all causes of
      dispute. 



      5. Reversion To Voluntary Trade Union Membership

      The formal attitude of the trade unions to the automatic
      enrolment of all wage-workers as union members has introduced a
      certain degree of bureaucratic distortion in the trade unions
      and has caused the latter to lose touch with the broad mass of
      their membership. Hence, it is necessary most resolutely to
      implement voluntary enrolment both of individuals and of groups
      into trade unions. Under no circumstances must trade union
      members be required to subscribe to any specific political
      views; in this respect, as well as in respect of religion, the
      trade unions must be non-partisan. All that must be required of
      trade union members in the proletarian state is that they should
      understand comradely discipline and the necessity of uniting the
      workers’ forces for the purpose of protecting the
      interests of the working people and of assisting the working
      people’s government, i. e., the Soviet government. The
      proletarian state must encourage the workers to organise in
      trade unions both by juridical and material means; but the trade
      unions can have no rights without duties.

      6. The Trade Unions And The Management Of Industry

      Following its seizure of political power, the principal and
      fundamental interest of the proletariat lies in securing an
      enormous increase in the productive forces of society and in the
      output of manufactured goods. This task, which is clearly
      formulated in the Programme of the Russian Communist Party, is
      particularly urgent in our country today owing to post-war ruin,
      famine and dislocation. Hence, the speediest and most enduring
      success in restoring large-scale industry is a condition without
      which no success can be achieved in the general cause of
      emancipating labour from the yoke of capital and securing the
      victory of socialism. To achieve this success in Russia, in her
      present state, it is absolutely essential that all authority in
      the factories should be concentrated in the hands of the
      management. The factory management, usually built up on the
      principle of one-man responsibility, must have authority
      independently to fix and pay out wages, and also distribute
      rations, working clothes, and all other supplies on the basis
      and within the limits of collective agreements concluded with
      the trade unions; it must enjoy the utmost freedom to manoeuvre,
      exercise strict control of the actual successes achieved in
      increasing production, in making the factory pay its way and in
      increasing profits, and carefully select the most talented and
      capable administrative personnel, etc. 

      Under these circumstances, all direct interference by the trade
      unions in the management of factories must be regarded as
      positively harmful and impermissible. 

      It would be absolutely wrong, however, to interpret this
      indisputable axiom to mean that the trade unions must play no
      part in the socialist organisation of industry and in the
      management of state industry. Their participation in this is
      necessary in the following strictly defined forms.

      7. The Role And Functions Of The Trade Unions In The Business
         And Administrative Organisations Of The Proletarian State

      The proletariat is the class foundation of the state
      accomplishing the transition from capitalism to socialism. In a
      country where the small peasantry is overwhelmingly predominant
      the proletariat can successfully fulfil this function only if it
      very skilfully, cautiously and gradually establishes an alliance
      with the vast majority of the peasantry. The trade unions must
      collaborate closely and constantly with the government, all the
      political and economic activities of which are guided by the
      class-conscious vanguard of the working class—the
      Communist Party. Being a school of communism in general, the
      trade unions must, in particular, be a school for training the
      whole mass of workers, and eventually all working people, in the
      art of managing socialist industry (and gradually also
      agriculture). 

      Proceeding from these principles, the trade unions’ part
      in the activities of the business and administrative
      organisations of the proletarian state should, in the immediate
      period, take the following main forms: 

      1. The trade unions should help to staff all the state business
         and administrative bodies connected with economies: nominate
         their candidates for them, stating their length of service,
         experience, and so forth. Right of decision lies solely with
         the business organisations, which also bear full
         responsibility for the activities of the respective
         organisations. The business organisations, however, must give
         careful consideration to the views on all candidates
         expressed by the trade unions concerned. 

      2. One of the most important functions of the trade unions is to
         promote and train factory managers from among the workers and
         the masses of the working people generally. At the present
         time we have scores of such factory managers who are quite
         satisfactory, and hundreds who are more or less satisfactory,
         but very soon, however, we must have hundreds of the former
         and thousands of the latter. The trade unions must much more
         carefully and regularly than hitherto keep a systematic
         register of all workers and peasants capable of holding posts
         of this kind, and thoroughly, efficiently and from every
         aspect verify the progress they make in learning the art of
         management. 

      3. The trade unions must take a far greater part in the
         activities of all the planning bodies of the proletarian
         state, in drawing up economic plans and also programmes of
         production and expenditure of stocks of material supplies for
         the workers, in selecting the factories that are to continue
         to receive state supplies, to be leased, or to be given out
         as concessions, etc. The trade unions should undertake no
         direct functions of controlling production in private and
         leased enterprises, but participate in the regulation of
         private capitalist production exclusively by sharing in the
         activities of the competent state bodies. In addition to
         participating in all cultural and educational activities and
         in production propaganda, the trade unions must also, on an
         increasing scale, enlist the working class and the masses of
         the working people generally for all branches of the work of
         building up the state economy; they must make them familiar
         with all aspects of economic life and with all details of
         industrial operations—from the procurement of raw
         materials to the marketing of the product; give them a more
         and more concrete understanding of the single state plan of
         socialist economy and the worker’s and peasant’s
         practical interest in its implementation. 

      4. The drawing up of scales of wages and supplies, etc., is one
         of the essential functions of the trade unions in the
         building of socialism and in their participation in the
         management of industry. In particular, disciplinary courts
         should steadily improve labour discipline and proper ways of
         promoting it and achieving increased productivity; but they
         must not interfere with the functions of the People’s
         Courts in general or with the functions of factory
         managements. 

      This list of the major functions of the trade unions in the work
      of building up socialist economy should, of course, be drawn up
      in greater detail by the competent trade union and government
      bodies. Taking into account the experience of the enormous work
      accomplished by the unions in organising the economy and its
      management, and also the mistakes which have caused no little
      harm and which resulted from direct, unqualified, incompetent
      and irresponsible interference in administrative matters, it is
      most important, in order to restore the economy and strengthen
      the Soviet system, deliberately and resolutely to start
      persevering practical activities calculated to extend over a
      long period of years and designed to give the workers and all
      working people generally practical training in the art of
      managing the economy of the whole country.

      8. Contact Wlth The Masses—The Fundamental Condition For
         All Trade Union Activity

      Contact with the masses, i. e., with the overwhelming majority
      of the workers (and eventually of all the working people), is
      the most important and most fundamental condition for the
      success of all trade union activity. In all the trade union
      organisations and their machinery, from bottom up, there should
      be instituted, and tested in practice over a period of many
      years, a system of responsible comrades—who must not all
      be Communists—who should live right among the workers,
      study their lives in every detail, and be able unerringly, on
      any question, and at any time, to judge the mood, the real
      aspirations, needs and thoughts of the masses. They must be able
      without a shadow of false idealisation to define the degree of
      their class-consciousness and the extent to which they are
      influenced by various prejudices and survivals of the past; and
      they must be able to win the boundless confidence of the masses
      by comradeship and concern for their needs. One of the greatest
      and most serious dangers that confront the numerically small
      Communist Party which, as the vanguard of the working class, is
      guiding a vast country in the process of transition to socialism
      (for the time being without the direct support of the more
      advanced countries), is isolation from the masses, the danger
      that the vanguard may run too far ahead and fail to "straighten
      out the line", fail to maintain firm contact with the whole army
      of labour, i. e., with the overwhelming majority of workers and
      peasants. Just as the very best factory, with the very best
      motors and first-class machines, will be forced to remain idle
      if the transmission belts from the motors to the machines are
      damaged, so our work of socialist construction must meet with
      inevitable disaster if the trade unions—the transmission
      belts from the Communist Party to the masses—are badly
      fitted or function badly. It is not sufficient to explain, to
      reiterate and corroborate this truth; it must be backed up
      organisationally by the whole structure of the trade unions and
      by their everyday activities.

      9. The Contradictions In The Status Of The Trade Unions Under
         The Dictatorship Of The Proletariat

      From all the foregoing it is evident that there are a number of
      contradictions in the various functions of the trade unions. On
      the one hand, their principal method of operation is that of
      persuasion and education; on the other hand, as participants in
      the exercise of state power they cannot refuse to share in
      coercion. On the one hand, their main function is to protect the
      interests of the masses of the working people in the most direct
      and immediate sense of the term; on the other hand, as
      participants in the exercise of state power and builders of the
      economy as a whole they cannot refuse to resort to pressure. On
      the one hand, they must operate in military fashion, for the
      dictatorship of the proletariat is the fiercest, most dogged and
      most desperate class war; on the other hand, specifically
      military methods of operation are least of all applicable to the
      trade unions. On the one hand, they must be able to adapt
      themselves to the masses, to their level; on the other hand,
      they must never pander to the prejudices and backwardness of the
      masses, but steadily raise them to a higher and higher level,
      etc., etc. These contradictions are no accident, and they will
      persist for several decades; for as long as survivals of
      capitalism and small production remain, contradictions between
      them and the young shoots of socialism are inevitable throughout
      the social system. 

      Two practical conclusions must be drawn from this. First, for
      the successful conduct of trade union activities it is not
      enough to understand their functions correctly, it is not enough
      to organise them properly. In addition, special tact is
      required, ability to approach the masses in a special way in
      each individual case for the purpose of raising these masses to
      a higher cultural, economic and political stage with the minimum
      of friction. 

      Second, the afore-mentioned contradictions will inevitably give
      rise to disputes, disagreements, friction, etc. A higher body is
      required with sufficient authority to settle these at once. This
      higher body is the Communist Party and the international
      federation of the Communist Parties of all countries—the
      Communist International.

      10. The Trade Unions And The Specialists

      The main principles of this question are set forth in the
      Programme of the Russian Communist Party; but these will remain
      paper principles if constant attention is not paid to the facts
      which indicate the degree to which they are put into
      practice. Recent facts of this kind are: first, cases of the
      murder of engineers by workers in socialised mines not only in
      the Urals, but also in the Donets Basin; second the suicide of
      V. V. Oldenborger, Chief Engineer of the Moscow Waterworks,
      because of the intolerable working conditions due to the
      incompetent and impermissible conduct of the members of the
      Communist group, as well as of organs of the Soviet government,
      which prompted the All-Russia Central Executive Committee to
      turn the whole matter over to the judicial authorities. 

      The Communist Party and the Soviet government as a whole bear a
      far greater share of the blame for cases of this kind than the
      trade unions. But the present issue is not one of establishing
      the degree of political guilt, but of drawing certain political
      conclusions. Unless our leading bodies, i. e., the Communist
      Party, the Soviet government and the trade unions, guard as the
      apple of their eye every specialist who does his work
      conscientiously and knows and loves it—even though the
      ideas of communism are totally alien to him—it will be
      useless to expect any serious progress in socialist
      construction. We may not be able to achieve it soon, but we must
      at all costs achieve a situation in which specialists—as a
      separate social stratum, which will persist until we have
      reached the highest stage of development of communist
      society—can enjoy better conditions of life under
      socialism than they enjoyed under capitalism insofar as concerns
      their material and legal status, comradely collaboration with
      the workers and peasants, and in the mental plane, i. e.,
      finding satisfaction in their work, realising that it is
      socially useful and independent of the sordid interests of the
      capitalist class. Nobody will regard a government department as
      being tolerably well organised if it does not take systematic
      measures to provide for all the needs of the specialists, to
      reward the best of them, to safeguard and protect their
      interests, etc., and does not secure practical results in
      this.

      The trade unions must conduct all the activities of the type
      indicated (or systematically collaborate in the activities of
      all the government departments concerned) not from the point of
      view of the interests of the given department, but from the
      point of view of the interests of labour and of the economy as a
      whole. With regard to the specialists, on the trade unions
      devolves the very arduous duty of daily exercising influence on
      the broad masses of the working people in order to create proper
      relations between them and the specialists. Only such activities
      can produce really important practical results.

      11. The Trade Unions And Petty-Bourgeois Influence On The
          Working Class

      Trade unions are really effective only when they unite very
      broad strata of the non-Party workers. This must give
      rise—particularly in a country in which the peasantry
      greatly predominates—to relative stability, specifically
      among the trade unions, of those political influences that serve
      as the superstructure over the remnants of capitalism and over
      small production. These influences are petty-bourgeois, i. e.,
      Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik (the Russian variety of
      the parties of the Second and Two-and-a-Half Internationals) on
      the one hand, and anarchist on the other. Only among these
      trends has any considerable number of people remained who defend
      capitalism ideologically and not from selfish class motives, and
      continue to believe in the non-class nature of the "democracy",
      "equality", and "liberty " in general that they preach. 

      It is to this socio-economic cause and not to the role of
      individual groups, still less of individual persons, that we
      must attribute the survivals (sometimes even the revival) in our
      country of such petty-bourgeois ideas among the trade
      unions. The Communist Party, the Soviet bodies that conduct
      cultural and educational activities and all Communist members of
      trade unions must therefore devote far more attention to the
      ideological struggle against petty-bourgeois influences, trends
      and deviations among the trade unions, especially because the
      New Economic Policy is bound to lead to a certain strengthening
      of capitalism. It is urgently necessary to counteract this by
      intensifying the struggle against petty-bourgeois influences
      upon the working class.

Comrade Trotsky has already said everything necessary, and
said it very well, about the general purposes of Pod Znamenem
Marksizma in issue No. 1-2 of that journal. I should like to deal
with certain questions that more closely define the content and programme
of the work which its editors have set forth in the introductory statement
in this issue.
This statement says that not all those gathered round the journal
Pod Znamenem Marksizma are Communists but that they are all
consistent materialists.
I think that this alliance of Communists and non-Communists is absolutely
essential and correctly defines the purposes of the journal. One of the
biggest and most dangerous mistakes made by Communists (as generally by
revolutionaries who have successfully accomplished the beginning of a
great revolution) is the idea that a revolution can be made by
revolutionaries alone. On the contrary, to be successful, all serious
revolutionary work requires that the idea that revolutionaries are capable
of playing the part only of the vanguard of the truly virile and advanced
class must be understood and translated into action. A vanguard performs
its task as vanguard only when it is able to avoid being isolated from the
mass of the people it leads and is able really to lead the whole mass
forward. Without an alliance with non-Communists in the most diverse
spheres of activity there can be no question of any successful communist
construction.
This also applies to the defence of materialism and Marxism, which has
been undertaken Pod Znamenem Marksizma. Fortunately, the main
trends of advanced social thinking in Russia have a solid materialist
tradition. Apart from G. V.
Plekhanov, it will be enough to mention Chernyshevsky, from whom the
modern Narodniks (the
Popular Socialists, Socialist-Revolutionaries, etc.) have frequently
retreated in quest of fashionable reactionary philosophical doctrines,
captivated by the tinsel of the so-called last word in European science,
and unable to discern beneath this tinsel some variety of servility to the
bourgeoisie, to bourgeois prejudice and bourgeois reaction.
At any rate, in Russia we still have — and shall undoubtedly have
for a fairly long time to come — materialists from the non-communist
camp, and it is our absolute duty to enlist all adherents of consistent
and militant materialism in the joint work of combating philosophical
reaction and the philosophical prejudices of so-called educated society.
Dietzgen
senior — not to be confused with his writer son, who was as
pretentious as he was unsuccessful — correctly, aptly and clearly
expressed the fundamental Marxist view of the philosophical trends which
prevail in bourgeois countries and enjoy the regard of their scientists
and publicists, when he said that in effect the professors of philosophy
in modern society are in the majority of cases nothing but “graduated
flunkeys of clericalism “.
Our Russian intellectuals, who, like their brethren in all other
countries, are fond of thinking themselves advanced, are very much averse
to shifting the question to the level of the opinion expressed in
Dietzgen’s words. But they are averse to it because they cannot look
the truth in the face. One has only to give a little thought to the
governmental and also the general economic, social and every other kind of
dependence of modern educated people on the ruling bourgeoisie to realise
that Dietzgen’s scathing description was absolutely true. One has
only to recall the vast majority of the fashionable philosophical trends
that arise so frequently in European countries, beginning for example with
those connected with the discovery of radium and ending with those which
are now seeking to clutch at the skirts of Einstein
, to gain an idea of the connection between the class interests and the
class position of the bourgeoisie and its support of all forms of religion
on the one hand, and the ideological content of the fashionable
philosophical trends on the other.
It will be seen from the above that a journal that sets out to be a
militant materialist organ must be primarily a militant organ, in the
sense of unflinchingly exposing and indicting all modern “graduated
flunkeys of clericalism”, irrespective of whether they act as
representatives of official science or as free lances calling themselves
“democratic Left or ideologically socialist” publicists.
In the second place, such a journal must be a militant atheist organ.
We have departments, or at least state institutions, which are in charge
of this work. But the work is being carried on with extreme apathy and
very unsatisfactorily, and is apparently suffering from the general
conditions of our truly Russian (even though Soviet) bureaucratic ways. It
is therefore highly essential that in addition to the work of these state
institutions, and in order to improve and infuse life into that work, a
journal which sets out to propagandise militant materialism must carry on
untiring atheist propaganda and an untiring atheist fight. The literature
on the subject in all languages should be carefully followed and
everything at all valuable in this sphere should be translated, or at
least reviewed.
Engels long ago advised the contemporary leaders of the proletariat to
translate the militant atheist literature of the late eighteenth century
for mass distribution among the people. We have not done this up to the
present, to our shame be it said (this is one of the numerous proofs that
it is much easier to seize power in a revolutionary epoch than to know how
to use this power properly). Our apathy, inactivity and incompetence are
sometimes excused on all sorts of “lofty” grounds, as, for
example, that the old atheist literature of the eighteenth century is
antiquated, unscientific, naive, etc. There is nothing worse than such
pseudo-scientific sophistry, which serves as a screen either for pedantry
or for a complete misunderstanding of Marxism. There is, of course, much
that is unscientific and naive in the atheist writings of the
eighteenth-century revolutionaries. But nobody prevents the publishers of
these writings from abridging them and providing them with brief
postscripts pointing out the progress made by mankind in the scientific
criticism of religions since the end of the eighteenth century, mentioning
the latest writings on the subject, and so forth. It would be the biggest
and most grievous mistake a Marxist could make to think that the millions
of the people (especially the peasants and artisans), who have been
condemned by all modern society to darkness, ignorance and superstitions
— can extricate themselves from this darkness only along the
straight line of a purely Marxist education. These masses should be
supplied with the most varied atheist propaganda material, they should be
made familiar with facts from the most diverse spheres of life, they
should be approached in every possible way, so as to interest them, rouse
them from their religious torpor, stir them front the most varied angles
and by the most varied methods, and so forth.
The keen, vivacious and talented writings of the old eighteenth-century
atheists wittily and openly attacked the prevailing clericalism and will
very often prove a thousand times more suitable for arousing people from
their religious torpor than the dull and dry paraphrases of Marxism,
almost completely unillustrated by skillfully selected facts, which
predominate in our literature and which (it is no use hiding the fact)
frequently distort Marxism. We have translations of all the major works of
Marx and Engels. There are absolutely no grounds for fearing that the old
atheism and old materialism will remain un-supplemented by the corrections
introduced by Marx and Engels. The most important thing — and it is
this that is most frequently overlooked by those of our Communists who are
supposedly Marxists, but who in fact mutilate Marxism — is to know
how to awaken in the still undeveloped masses an intelligent attitude
towards religious questions and an intelligent criticism of religions.
On the other hand, take a glance at modern scientific critics of
religion. These educated bourgeois writers almost invariably
“supplement” their own refutations of religious superstitions
with arguments which immediately expose them as ideological slaves of the
bourgeoisie, as “graduated flunkeys of clericalism”.
Two examples. Professor R. Y. Wipper published in 1918 a little book
entitled Vozniknovenie Khristianstva (The Origin of
Christianity — Pharos Publishing House, Moscow). In his account
of the principal results of modern science, the author not only refrains
from combating the superstitions and deception which are the weapons of
the church as a political organisation, not only evades these questions,
but makes the simply ridiculous and most reactionary claim that he is
above both “extremes “ — the idealist and the materialist.
This is toadying to the ruling bourgeoisie, which all over the world
devotes to the support of religion hundreds of millions of rubles from.
the profits squeezed out of the working people.
The well-known German scientist, Arthur Drews, while refuting religious
superstitions and fables in his book, Die Christusmythe (The
Christ Myth), and while showing that Christ never existed, at the end
of the book declares in favour of religion, albeit a renovated, purified
and more subtle religion, one that would be capable of withstanding
“the daily growing naturalist torrent” (fourth German edition,
1910, p. 238). Here we have an out-spoken and deliberate reactionary, who
is openly helping the exploiters to replace the old, decayed religious
superstitions by new, more odious and vile superstitions.
This does not mean that Drews should not be translated. It means that
while in a certain measure effecting an alliance with the progressive
section of the bourgeoisie, Communists and all consistent materialists
should unflinchingly expose that section when it is guilty of reaction. It
means that to shun an alliance with the representatives of the bourgeoisie
of the eighteenth century, i.e., the period when it was revolutionary,
would be to betray Marxism and materialism; for an “alliance”
with the Drewses, in one form or another and in one degree or another., is
essential for our struggle against the predominating religious
obscurantists.
Pod Znamenem Marksizma, which sets out to be an organ of
militant materialism, should devote much of its space to atheist
propaganda, to reviews of the literature on the subject and to correcting
the immense shortcomings of our governmental work in this field. It is
particularly important to utilise books and pamphlets which contain many
concrete facts and comparisons showing how the class interests and class
organisations of the modern bourgeoisie are connected with the
organisations of religious institutions and religious propaganda.
All material relating to the United States of America, where the
official. state connection between religion and capital is less manifest,
is extremely important. But, on the other hand, it becomes all the clearer
to us that so-called modern democracy (which the Mensheviks, the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, partly also the anarchists, etc., so
unreasonably worship) is nothing but the freedom to preach whatever is to
the advantage of the bourgeoisie, to preach, namely, the most reactionary
ideas, religion, obscurantism, defence of the exploiters, etc.
One would like to hope that a journal which sets out to be a militant
materialist organ will provide our reading public with reviews of atheist
literature, showing for which circle of readers any particular writing
might be suitable and in what respect, and mentioning what literature has
been published in our country (only decent translations should be given
notice, and they are not so many), and what is still to be published.
 
In addition to the alliance with consistent materialists who do not
belong to the Communist Party, of no less and perhaps oven of more
importance for the work which militant materialism should perform is an
alliance with those modern natural scientists who incline towards
materialism and are not afraid to defend and preach it as against the
modish philosophical wanderings into idealism and scepticism which are
prevalent in so-called educated society.
The article by A. Timiryazev on Einstein’s theory of relativity
published in Pod Znamenem Marksizma No. 1-2 permits us to hope
that the journal will succeed in effecting this second alliance too.
Greater attention should be paid to it. It should be remembered that the
sharp upheaval which modern natural science is undergoing very often gives
rise to reactionary philosophical schools and minor schools. trends and
minor trends. Unless, therefore, the problems raised by the recent
revolution in natural science are followed, and unless natural scientists
are enlisted in the work of a philosophical journal, militant materialism
can be neither militant nor materialism. Timiryazev was obliged to observe
in the first issue of the journal that the theory of Einstein, who,
according to Timiryazev, is himself not making any active attack on the
foundations of materialism, has already been seized upon by a vast number
of bourgeois intellectuals of all countries; it should be noted that this
applies not only to Einstein, but to a number, if not to the majority, of
the great reformers of natural science since the end of the nineteenth
century.
For our attitude towards this phenomenon to be a politically conscious
one, it must be realised that no natural science and no materialism can
hold its own in the struggle against the onslaught of bourgeois ideas and
the restoration of the bourgeois world outlook unless it stands on solid
philosophical ground. In order to hold his own in this struggle and carry
it to a victorious finish, the natural scientist must be a modern
materialist, a conscious adherent of the materialism represented by Marx,
i.e., he must be a dialectical materialist. In order to attain this aim,
the contributors to Pod Znamenem Marksizma must arrange for the
systematic study of Hegelian
dialectics from a materialist standpoint, i.e., the dialectics
which Marx applied
practically in his Capital and in his historical and
political works, and applied so successfully that now every day of the
awakening to life and struggle of new classes in the East (Japan, India,
and China) — i.e., the hundreds of millions of human beings who form
the greater part of the world population and whose historical passivity
and historical torpor have hitherto conditioned the stagnation and decay
of many advanced European countries — every day of the awakening to
life of new peoples and new classes serves as a fresh confirmation of
Marxism.
Of course, this study, this interpretation, this propaganda of Hegelian
dialectics is extremely difficult, and the first experiments in this
direction will undoubtedly be accompanied by errors. But only he who never
does anything never makes mistakes. Taking as our basis Marx’s method
of applying materialistically conceived Hegelian dialectics, we can and
should elaborate this dialectics from all aspects, print in the journal
excerpts from Hegel’s principal works, interpret them
materialistically and comment on them with the help of examples of the way
Marx applied dialectics, as well as of examples of dialectics in the
sphere of economic and political relations, which recent history,
especially modern imperialist war and revolution, provides in unusual
abundance. In my opinion, the editors and contributors of Pod Znamenem
Marksizma should be a kind of “Society of Materialist Friends of
Hegelian Dialectics”. Modern natural scientists (if they know how to
seek, and if we learn to help them) will find in the Hegelian dialectics,
materialistically interpreted, a series of answers to the philosophical
problems which are being raised by the revolution in natural science and
which make the intellectual admirers of bourgeois fashion
“stumble” into reaction.
Unless it sets itself such a task and systematically fulfills it,
materialism cannot be militant materialism. It will be not so much the
fighter as the fought, to use an expression of Shchedrin’s. Without
this, eminent natural scientists will as often as hitherto he helpless in
making their philosophical deductions and generalisations. For natural
science is progressing so fast and is undergoing such a profound
revolutionary upheaval in all spheres that it cannot possibly dispense
with philosophical deductions.
In conclusion, I will cite an example which has nothing to do with
philosophy, but does at any rate concern social questions, to which
Pod Znamenem Marksizma also desires ,to devote attention.
It is an example of the way in which modern pseudo-science actually
serves as a vehicle for the grossest and most infamous reactionary
views.
I was recently sent a copy of Ekonomist No. 1 (1922),
published by the Eleventh Department of the Russian Technical
‘Society. The young Communist who sent me this journal (he probably
had no time to read it) rashly expressed considerable agreement with it.
In reality the journal is — I do not know to what extent
deliberately — an organ of the modern feudalists, disguised of
course under a cloak of science, democracy and so forth.
A certain Mr. P. A. Sorokin publishes in this journal an extensive,
so-called “sociological”, inquiry on “The Influence of the
War”. This learned article abounds in learned references to the
“sociological” works of the author and his numerous teachers and
colleagues abroad. Here is an example of his learning.
On page 83, I read:
“For every 10,000 marriages in Petrograd there are
now 92.2 divorces — a fantastic figure. Of every 100 annulled
marriages, 51.1 had lasted less than one year, 11 per cent less than one
month, 22 per cent less than two months, 41 per cent less than three to
six months and only 26 per cent over six months. These figures show that
modern legal marriage is a form which conceals what is in effect
extra-marital sexual intercourse, enabling lovers of
‘strawberries’ to satisfy their appetites in a ‘legal’
way” (Ekonomist No. 1, p. 83)
Both this gentleman and the Russian Technical Society,
which publishes this journal and gives space to this kind of talk, no
doubt regard themselves as adherents of democracy and would consider it a
great insult to be called what they are in fact, namely, feudalists,
reactionaries, “graduated. flunkeys of clericalism”.
Even the slightest acquaintance with the legislation of bourgeois
countries on marriage, divorce and illegitimate children, and with the
actual state of affairs in this field, is enough to show anyone interested
in the subject that modern bourgeois democracy, even in all the most
democratic bourgeois republics, exhibits a truly feudal attitude in this
respect towards women and towards children born out of wedlock.
This, of course, does not prevent the Mensheviks, the
Socialist-Revolutionaries, a part of the anarchists and all the
corresponding parties in the West from shouting about democracy and how it
is being violated by the Bolsheviks. But as a matter of fact the Bolshevik
revolution is the only consistently democratic revolution in respect to
such questions as marriage, divorce and the position of children born out
of wedlock. And this is a question which most directly affects the
interests of more than half the population of any country. Although a
large number of bourgeois revolutions preceded it and called themselves
democratic, the Bolshevik revolution was the first and only revolution to
wage a resolute struggle in this respect both against reaction and
feudalism and against the usual hypocrisy of the ruling and propertied
classes.
If 92 divorces for every 10,000 marriages seem to Mr. Sorekin a
fantastic figure, one can only suppose that either the author lived and
was brought up in a monastery so entirely walled off from life that hardly
anyone will believe such a monastery ever existed, or that he is
distorting the truth in the interest of reaction and the bourgeoisie.
Anybody in the least acquainted with social conditions in bourgeois
countries knows that the real number of actual divorces (of course, not
sanctioned by church and law) is everywhere immeasurably greater. The only
difference between Russia and other countries in this respect is that our
laws do not sanctify hypocrisy and the debasement of the woman and her
child, but openly and in the name of the government declare systematic war
on all hypocrisy and all debasement.
The Marxist journal will have to wage war also on these modern
“educated” feudalists. Not a few of them, very likely, are in
receipt of government money and are employed by our government to educate
our youth, although they are no more fitted for this than notorious
perverts are fitted for the post of superintendents of educational
establishments for the young.
The working class of Russia proved able to win power; but it has not
yet learned to utilise it, for otherwise it would have long ago very
politely dispatched such teachers and members of learned societies to
countries with a bourgeois “democracy” That is the proper place
for such feudalists.
But it will learn, given the will to learn.

      Speech In Opening The Congress March 27



      Comrades, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party I
      declare the Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P. open.

      Comrades, you have gathered in congress after a whole year, in
      the course of which we have, for the first time, been free from
      the intervention and invasion of capitalist countries, at all
      events, in their most direct form. This is the first year that
      we have had the opportunity of devoting our efforts to the real,
      main and fundamental tasks of socialist construction. 

      In this field we have undoubtedly taken only the first
      steps. But I am sure that if we soberly appraise what we have
      achieved and are not afraid to look facts—which are not
      always pleasant, and sometimes very unpleasant—straight in
      the face, we shall certainly overcome all the difficulties that
      only now are looming ahead of us in all their magnitude.

      The disasters that befell us in the past year were, if anything,
      even more severe than those of the preceding years.

      It seemed as if all the consequences of the imperialist war and
      of the war which the capitalists forced upon us had combined and
      hurled themselves upon us in the shape of famine and the most
      desperate ruin. These disasters have as yet been far from
      overcome; and none of us expects that they can be overcome
      soon.

      But if we maintain and strengthen the unity of our Party, if we
      emerge from international difficulties as successfully as we
      have done up to now, if we concentrate all

      

      our efforts on the
      tasks that now necessarily arise from present conditions, there
      can be no doubt that we shall overcome these difficulties.

      All over the world the communist movement is growing, if not as
      fast as those of us who measured it by wartime and immediate
      post-war standards expected, at all events it is growing and is
      becoming sound, solid, broad and deep. And if we, in
      co-operation with the Communist Parties that now exist in all,
      or nearly all, countries, soberly assess our position and are
      not afraid to admit our mistakes, we shall victoriously emerge
      from all these difficulties.

      Political Report Of The Central Committee Of The R.C.P. (B.)
      March 27 



      (Applause.) Comrades, permit me to start the political
      report of the Central Committee from the end and not from the
      beginning of the year. The political question most discussed
      today is Genoa. But since a great deal has already been said on
      the subject in our press, and since I have already said what is
      most essential to it in my speech on March 6, which has been
      published, I would ask you to permit me to refrain from going
      into details unless you particularly wish me to do so.

      On the whole you know everything about Genoa, because much has
      been written about it in the newspapers—in my opinion too
      much, to the detriment of the real, practical and urgent
      requirements of our work of construction in general, and of our
      economic development in particular. In Europe, in all bourgeois
      countries, of course, they like to occupy people’s minds,
      or stuff their heads, with all sorts of trash about Genoa. On
      this occasion (I would say not only on this occasion) we are
      copying them, and copying them far too much.

      I must say that in the Central Committee we have taken very
      great pains to appoint a delegation of our best diplomats (we
      now have a fair number of Soviet diplomats, which was not the
      case in the early period of the Soviet Republic). The Central
      Committee has drawn up sufficiently detailed instructions for
      our diplomats at the Genoa Conference; we spent a long time
      discussing these instructions

      

      and considered and reconsidered
      them several times. It goes without saying that the question
      here is, I shall not say of war, because that term is likely to
      be misunderstood, but at all events one of rivalry. In the
      bourgeois camp there is a very strong trend, much stronger than
      any other, that wants to wreck the Genoa Conference. There are
      trends which greatly favour the Genoa Conference and want it to
      meet at all costs. The latter have now gained the upper
      hand. Lastly, in all bourgeois countries there are trends which
      might be called pacifist trends, among which should be included
      the entire Second and Two-and-a-Half Internationals. It is this
      section of the bourgeoisie which is advocating a number of
      pacifist proposals and is trying to concoct something in the
      nature of a pacifist policy. As Communists we have definite
      views about this pacifism which it would be superfluous to
      expound here. Needless to say, we are going to Genoa not as
      Communists, but as merchants. We must trade, and they must
      trade. We want the trade to benefit us; they want it to benefit
      them. The course of the issue will be determined, if only to a
      small degree, by the skill of our diplomats.

      Insofar as we are going to Genoa as merchants it is obviously by
      no means a matter of indifference to us whether we shall deal
      with those people from the bourgeois camp who are inclined to
      settle the problem by war, or with those who are inclined
      towards pacifism, even the worst kind of pacifism, which from
      the communist viewpoint will not stand the slightest
      criticism. It would be a bad merchant, indeed, if he were unable
      to appreciate this distinction, and, by shaping his tactics
      accordingly, achieve practical aims.

      We are going to Genoa for the practical purpose of expanding
      trade and of creating the most favourable conditions for its
      successful development on the widest scale. But we cannot
      guarantee the success of the Genoa Conference. It would be
      ridiculous and absurd to give any guarantees on that score. I
      must say, however, that, weighing up the present possibilities
      of Genoa in the most sober and cautious manner, I think that it
      will not be an exaggeration to say that we shall achieve our
      object.

      Through Genoa, if the other parties in the negotiations

      

      are sufficiently shrewd and not too stubborn; bypassing Genoa if
      they take it into their heads to be stubborn. But we shall
      achieve our goal!

      The fact of the matter is that the most urgent, pressing and
      practical interests that have been sharply revealed in all the
      capitalist countries during the past few years call for the
      development, regulation and expansion of trade with
      Russia. Since such interests exist, we may argue, we may
      quarrel, we may disagree on specific combinations—it is
      highly probable that we shall have to disagree—this
      fundamental economic necessity will, nevertheless, after all is
      said and done, make a way for itself. I think we can rest
      assured of that I cannot vouch for the date; I cannot vouch for
      success; but at this gathering we can say with a fair amount of
      certainty that regular trade relations between the Soviet
      Republic and all the capitalist countries in the world are
      certain to continue developing. When I come to it in another
      part of my report I shall mention the hitches that may possibly
      occur; but I think that this is all that need be said on the
      question of Genoa.

      Needless to say, the comrades who desire to study the question
      in greater detail and who are not content with the list of
      delegates published in the newspapers may set up a commission,
      or a section, and acquaint themselves with all the material of
      the Central Committee, and all the correspondence and
      instructions. Of course, the details we have outlined are
      provisional, for no one up to now knows exactly who will sit
      round the table at Genoa, and what terms, or preliminary terms
      or provisions will be announced. It would be highly inexpedient,
      and I think practically impossible, to discuss all this here. I
      repeat, this Congress, through the medium of a section, or a
      commission, has every opportunity to collect all the documents
      on this question—both the published documents and those in
      the possession of the Central Committee.

      I shall not say any more, for I am sure that it is not here that
      our greatest difficulties lie. This is not the question on which
      the attention of the whole Party should be focussed. The
      European bourgeois press is artificially and deliberately
      inflating and exaggerating the importance of this Conference in
      order to deceive the masses of the

      

      working people (as nine-tenths of the bourgeois press in all
      these free democratic countries and republics always does). We
      have succumbed to the influence of this press to some extent. As
      usual, our press still yields to the old bourgeois habits; it
      refuses to adopt new, socialist methods, and we have made a
      greater fuss about this subject than it deserves. In fact, for
      Communists, especially for those who have lived through such
      stern years as we have lived through since 1917, and witnessed
      the formidable political combinations that have appeared in that
      period, Genoa does not present any great difficulties. I cannot
      recall any disagreement or controversy on this question either
      in the Central Committee or in the ranks of the Party. This is
      natural, for there is nothing controversial here from the point
      of view of Communists, even bearing in mind the various shades
      of opinion among them. I repeat: we are going to Genoa as
      merchants for the purpose of securing the most favourable terms
      for promoting the trade which has started, which is being
      carried on, and which, even if someone succeeded in forcibly
      interrupting it for a time, would inevitably continue to develop
      after the interruption.

      Hence, confining myself to these brief remarks about Genoa, I
      shall now proceed to deal with the issues which, in my opinion,
      have been the major political questions of the past year and
      which will be such in the ensuing year. It seems to me that the
      political report of the Central Committee should not merely deal
      with the events of the year under review, but also point out
      (that, at any rate, is what I usually do) the main, fundamental
      political lessons of the events of that year, so that we may
      learn something for the ensuing year and be in a position to
      correctly determine our policy for that year.

      The New Economic Policy is, of course, the major question. This
      has been the dominant question throughout the year under
      review. If we have any important, serious and irrevocable gain
      to record for this year (and I am not so very sure that we
      have), it is that we have learnt something from the launching of
      this New Economic Policy. If we have learnt even a little, then,
      during the past year, we have learnt a great deal in this
      field. And the test of whether

      

      we have really learnt anything, and to what extent, will
      probably be made by subsequent events of a kind which we
      ourselves can do little to determine, as for example the
      impending financial crisis. It seems to me that in connection
      with the New Economic Policy, the most important things to keep
      in mind as a basis for all our arguments, as a means of testing
      our experience during the past year, and of learning practical
      lessons for the ensuing year are contained in the following
      three points.

      First, the New Economic Policy is important for us primarily as
      a means of testing whetherwe are really establishing a link with
      the peasant economy. In the preceding period of development of
      our revolution, when all our attention and all our efforts were
      concentrated mainly on, or almost entirely absorbed by, the task
      of repelling invasion, we could not devote the necessary
      attention to this link; we had other things to think about. To
      some extent we could and had to ignore this bond when we were
      confronted by the absolutely urgent and overshadowing task of
      warding off the danger of being immediately crushed by the
      gigantic forces of world imperialism.

      The turn towards the New Economic Policy was decided on at the
      last Congress with exceptional unanimity, with even greater
      unanimity than other questions have been decided by our Party
      (which, it must be admitted, is generally distinguished for its
      unanimity). This unanimity showed that the need for a new
      approach to socialist economy had fully matured. People who
      differed on many questions, and who assessed the situation from
      different angles, unanimously and very quickly and unhesitantly
      agreed that we lacked a real approach to socialist economy, to
      the task of building its foundation; that the only means of
      finding this approach was the New Economic Policy. Owing to the
      course taken by the development of war events, by the
      development of political events, by the development of
      capitalism in the old, civilised West, and owing also to the
      social and political conditions that developed in the colonies,
      we were the first to make a breach in the old bourgeois world at
      a time when our country was economically, if not the most
      backward, at any rate one of the most backward countries in the
      world. The vast 

      

      majority of the peasants in our country are
      engaged in small individual farming. The items of our programme
      of building a communist society, that we could apply
      immediately, were to some extent outside the sphere of activity
      of the broad mass of the peasantry, upon whom we imposed very
      heavy obligations, which we justified on the grounds that war
      permitted no wavering in this matter. Taken as a whole, this was
      accepted as justification by the peasantry, not withstanding the
      mistakes we could not avoid. On the whole, the mass of the
      peasantry realised and understood that the enormous burdens
      imposed upon them were necessary in order to save the
      workers’ and peasants’ rule from the landowners and
      prevent it from being strangled by capitalist invasion, which
      threatened to wrest away all the gains of the revolution. But
      there was no link between the peasant economy and the economy
      that was being built up in the nationalised, socialised
      factories and on state farms.

      We saw this clearly at the last Party Congress. We saw it so
      clearly that there was no hesitation whatever in the Party on
      the question as to whether the New Economic Policy was
      inevitable or not.

      It is amusing to read what is said about our decision in the
      numerous publications of the various Russian parties
      abroad. There are only trifling differences in the opinions they
      express. Living with memories of the past, they still continue
      to reiterate that to this day the Left Communists are opposed to
      the New Economic Policy. In 1921 they remembered what had
      occurred in 1918 and what our Left Communists themselves have
      forgotten; and they go on chewing this over and over again,
      assuring the world that these Bolsheviks are a sly and false
      lot, and that they are concealing from Europe that they have
      disagreements in their ranks. Reading this, one says to oneself,
      “Let them go on fooling themselves.” If this is what
      they imagine is going on in this country, we can judge the
      degree of intelligence of these allegedly highly educated old
      fogies who have fled abroad. We know that there have been no
      disagreements in our ranks, and the reason for this is that the
      practical necessity of a different approach to the task of
      building the foundation of socialist oconomy was clear to
      all. 



      There was no link between the peasant economy and the new
      economy we tried to create. Does it exist now? Not yet. We are
      only approaching it. The whole significance of the New Economic
      Policy—which our press still often searches for everywhere
      except where it should search—the whole purpose of this
      policy is to find a way of establishing a link between the new
      economy, which we are creating with such enormous effort, and
      the peasant economy. That is what stands to our credit; without
      it we would not be communist revolutionaries.

      We began to develop the new economy in an entirely new way,
      brushing aside everything old. Had we not begun to develop it we
      would have been utterly defeated in the very first months, in
      the very first years. But the fact that we began to develop this
      new economy with such splendid audacity does not mean that we
      must necessarily continue in the same way. Why should we? There
      is no reason.

      From the very beginning we said that we had to undertake an
      entirely new task, and that unless we received speedy assistance
      from our comrades, the workers in the capitalistically more
      developed countries, we should encounter incredible difficulties
      and certainly make a number of mistakes. The main thing is to be
      able dispassionately to examine where such mistakes have been
      made and to start again from the beginning. If we begin from the
      beginning, not twice, but many times, it will show that we are
      not bound by prejudice, and that we are approaching our task,
      which is the greatest the world has ever seen, with a sober
      outlook.

      Today, as far as the New Economic Policy is concerned the main
      thing is to assimilate the experience of the past year
      correctly. That must be done, and we want to do it. And if we
      want to do it, come what may (and we do want to do it, and shall
      do it!), we must know that the problem of the New Economic
      Policy, the fundamental, decisive and overriding problem, is to
      establish a link between the new economy that we have begun to
      create (very badly, very clumsily, but have nevertheless begun
      to create, on the basis of an entirely new, socialist economy,
      of a new system of production and distribution) and the peasant

      

      economy, by which millions and millions of peasants obtain their
      livelihood.

      This link has been lacking, and we must create it before
      anything else. Everything else must be subordinated to this. We
      have still to ascertain the extent to which the New Economic
      Policy has succeeded in creating this link without destroying
      what we have begun so clumsily to build. 

      We are developing our economy together with the peasantry. We
      shall have to alter it many times and organise it in such a way
      that it will provide a link between our socialist work on
      large-scale industry and agriculture and the work every peasant
      is doing as best he can, struggling out of poverty, without
      philosophising (for how can philosophising help him to extricate
      himself from his position and save him from the very real danger
      of a painful death from starvation?).

      We must reveal this link so that we may see it clearly, so that
      all the people may see it, and so that the whole mass of the
      peasantry may see that there is a connection between their
      present severe, incredibly ruined, incredibly impoverished and
      painful existence and the work which is being done for the sake
      of remote socialist ideals. We must bring about a situation
      where the ordinary, rank and-file working man realises that he
      has obtained some improvement, and that he has obtained it not
      in the way a few peasants obtained improvements under the rule
      of landowners and capitalists, when every improvement
      (undoubtedly there were improvements and very big ones) was
      accompanied by insult, derision and humiliation for the muzhik,
      by violence against the masses, which not a single peasant has
      forgotten, and which will not be forgot ten in Russia for
      decades. Our aim is to restore the link, to prove to the peasant
      by deeds that we are beginning with what is intelligible,
      familiar and immediately accessible to him, in spite of his
      poverty, and not with some thing remote and fantastic from the
      peasant’s point of view. We must prove that we can help
      him and that in this period, when the small peasant is in a
      state of appalling ruin, impoverishment and starvation, the
      Communists are really helping him. Either we prove that, or he
      will send us to the devil. That is absolutely inevitable. 



      Such is the significance of the New Economic Policy; it is the
      basis of our entire policy; it is the major lesson taught by the
      whole of the past year’s experience in applying the New
      Economic Policy, and, so to speak, our main political rule for
      the coming year. The peasant is allowing us credit, and, of
      course, after what he has lived through, he cannot do
      otherwise. Taken in the mass, the peasants go on saying:
      “Well, if you are not able to do it yet, we shall wait;
      perhaps you will learn.” But this credit cannot go on for
      ever.

      This we must know; and having obtained credit we must hurry. We
      must know that the time is approaching when this peasant country
      will no longer give us credit, when it will demand cash, to use
      a commercial term. It will say: “You have postponed
      payment for so many months, so many years. But by this time,
      dear rulers, you must have learnt the most sound and reliable
      method of helping us free ourselves from poverty, want,
      starvation and ruin. You can do it, you have proved it.”
      This is the test that we shall inevitably have to face; and, in
      the last analysis, this test will decide everything: the fate of
      NEP and the fate of communist rule in Russia.

      Shall we accomplish our immediate task or not? Is this NEP fit
      for anything or not? If the retreat turns out to be correct
      tactics, we must link up with the peasant masses while we are in
      retreat, and subsequently march forward with them a hundred
      times more slowly, but firmly and unswervingly, in a way that
      will always make it apparent to them that we are really marching
      forward. Then our cause will be absolutely invincible, and no
      power on earth can vanquish us. We did not accomplish this in
      the first year. We must say this frankly. And I am profoundly
      convinced (and our New Economic Policy enables us to draw this
      conclusion quite definitely and firmly) that if we appreciate
      the enormous danger harboured by NEP and concentrate all our
      forces on its weak points, we shall solve this problem.

      Link up with the peasant masses, with the rank-and-file working
      peasants, and begin to move forward
      immeasurably, infinitely
      more slowly than we expected, but in such a way that the entire
      mass will actually move forward

      

      with us. If we do that we shall
      in time progress much more quickly than we even dream of
      today. This, in my opinion, is the first fundamental political
      lesson of the New Economic Policy.

      The second, more specific lesson is the test through competition
      between state and capitalist enterprises. We are now forming
      mixed companies—I shall have something to say about these
      later on—which, like our state trade and our New Economic
      Policy as a whole, mean that we Communists are resorting to
      commercial, capitalist methods. These mixed companies are also
      important because through them practical competition is created
      between capitalist methods and our methods. Consider it
      practically. Up to now we have been writing a programme and
      making promises. In its time this was absolutely necessary. It
      is impossible to launch on a world revolution without a
      programme and without promises. If the whiteguards, including
      the Mensheviks, jeer at us for this, it only shows that the
      Mensheviks and the socialists of the Second and Two-and-a-Half
      Internationals have no idea, in general, of the way a revolution
      develops. We could proceed in no other way.

      Now, however, the position is that we must put our work to a
      serious test, and not the sort of test that is made by control
      institutions set up by the Communists themselves, even though
      these control institutions are magnificent, even though they are
      almost the ideal control institutions in the Soviet system and
      the Party; such a test may be mockery from the point of view of
      the actual requirements of the peasant economy, but it is
      certainly no mockery from the standpoint of our construction. We
      are now setting up these control institutions but I am referring
      not to this test but to the test from the point of view of the
      entire economy.

      The capitalist was able to supply things. He did it
      inefficiently, charged exorbitant prices, insulted and robbed
      us. The ordinary workers and peasants, who do not argue about
      communism because they do not know what it is, are well aware of
      this.

      “But the capitalists were, after all, able to supply
      things—are you? You are not able to do it.” That is
      what we heard last spring; though not always clearly audible, it
      was the

      

      undertone of the whole of last spring’s
      crisis. “As people you are splendid, but you cannot cope
      with the economic task you have undertaken.” This is the
      simple and withering criticism which the peasantry—and
      through the peasantry, some sections of workers—levelled
      at the Communist Party last year. That is why in the NEP
      question, this old point acquires such significance.

      We need a real test. The capitalists are operating along side
      us. They are operating like robbers; they make profit; but they
      know how to do things. But you—you are trying to do it in
      a new way: you make no profit, your principles are communist,
      your ideals are splendid; they are written out so beautifully
      that you seem to be saints, that you should go to heaven while
      you are still alive. But can you get things done? We need a
      test, a real test, not the kind the Central Control Commission
      makes when it censures somebody and the All-Russia Central
      Executive Committee imposes some penalty. Yes, we want a real
      test from the viewpoint of the national economy.

      We Communists have received numerous deferments, and more credit
      has been allowed us than any other government has ever been
      given. Of course, we Communists helped to get rid of the
      capitalists and landowners. The peasants appreciate this and
      have given us an extension of time, longer credit, but only for
      a certain period. After that comes the test: can you run the
      economy as well as the others? The old capitalist can; you
      cannot.

      That is the first lesson, the first main part of the political
      report of the Central Committee. We cannot run the economy. This
      has been proved in the past year. I would like very much to
      quote the example of several Gos-trests (if I may express myself
      in the beautiful Russian language that Turgenev praised so
      highly)* 

      
* An ironical reference to the habit, then emerging, of
abbreviating the names of various institutions. Here the
abbreviation stands for state
trusts. —Ed
      
      to show how we run the economy.

      Unfortunately, for a number of reasons, and largely owing to ill
      health, I have been unable to elaborate this part of my report
      and so I must confine myself to expressing

      

      my conviction, which
      is based on my observations of what is
      going on. During the past year we showed quite clearly that we
      cannot run the economy. That is the fun damental lesson. Either
      we prove the opposite in the coming year, or Soviet power will
      not be able to exist. And the greatest danger is that not
      everybody realises this. If all of us Communists, the
      responsible officials, clearly realise that we lack the ability
      to run the economy, that we must learn from the very beginning,
      then we shall win—that, in my opinion, is the fundamental
      conclusion that should be drawn. But many of us do not
      appreciate this and believe that if there are people who do
      think that way, it can only be the ignorant, who have not
      studied communism; perhaps they will some day learn and
      understand. No, excuse me, the point is not that the peasant or
      the non-Party worker has not studied communism, but that the
      time has passed when the job was to draft a programme and call
      upon the people to carry out this great programme. That time has
      passed. Today you must prove that you can give practical
      economic assistance to the workers and to the peasants under the
      present difficult conditions, and thus demonstrate to them that
      you have stood the test of competition.

      The mixed companies that we have begun to form, in which private
      capitalists, Russian and foreign, and Communists participate,
      provide one of the means by which we can learn to organise
      competition properly and show that we are no less able to
      establish a link with the peasant economy than the capitalists;
      that we can meet its requirements; that we can help the peasant
      make progress even at his present level, in spite of his
      backwardness; for it is impossible to change him in a brief span
      of time.

      That is the sort of competition confronting us as an absolutely
      urgent task. It is the pivot of the New Economic Policy and, in
      my opinion, the quintessence of the Party’s policy. We are
      faced with any number of purely political problems and
      difficulties. You know what they are: Genoa, the danger of
      intervention. The difficulties are enormous but they are nothing
      compared with this economic difficulty. We know how things are
      done in the political field; we have gained considerable
      experience; we have learned 

      

      a lot about bourgeois diplomacy. It
      is the sort of thing the Mensheviks taught us for fifteen years,
      and we got something useful out of it. This is not new.

      But here is something we must do now in the economic field. We
      must win the competition against the ordinary shop assistant,
      the ordinary capitalist, the merchant, who will go to the
      peasant without arguing about communism. Just imagine, he will
      not begin to argue about communism, but will argue in this
      way—if you want to obtain something, or carry on trade
      properly, or if you want to build, I will do the building at a
      high price; the Communists will, perhaps, build at a higher
      price, perhaps even ten times higher. It is this kind of
      agitation that is now the crux of the matter; herein lies the
      root of economics.

      I repeat, thanks to our correct policy, the people allowed us a
      deferment of payment and credit, and this, to put it in terms of
      NEP, is a promissory note. But this promissory note is undated,
      and you cannot learn from the wording when it will be presented
      for redemption. Therein lies the danger; this is the specific
      feature that distinguishes these political promissory notes from
      ordinary, commercial promissory notes. We must concentrate all
      our attention on this, and not rest content with the fact that
      there are responsible and good Communists in all the state
      trusts and mixed companies. That is of no use, because these
      Communists do not know how to run the economy and, in that
      respect, are inferior to the ordinary capitalist salesmen, who
      have received their training in big factorics and big firms. But
      we refuse to admit this; in this field communist
      conceit—komchvanstvo,* 

      * Literally,
“comconceit”. —Ed

      to use the great Russian
      language again—still persists. The whole point is that the
      responsible Communists, even the best of them, who are
      unquestionably honest and loyal, who in the old days suffered
      penal servitude and did not fear death, do not know how to
      trade, because they are not businessmen, they have not learnt to
      trade, do not want to learn and do not understand that they must
      start learning from the beginning. Communists, revolutionaries
      who have accomplished the greatest revolution in the world, on
      whom the 

      

      eyes of, if not forty pyramids, then, at all events, forty
      European countries are turned in the hope of emancipation from
      capitalism, must learn from ordinary salesmen. But these
      ordinary salesmen have had ten years’ warehouse experience
      and know the business, whereas the responsible Communists and
      devoted revolutionaries do not know the business, and do not
      even realise that they do not know it.

      And so, comrades, if we do away with at least this elementary
      ignorance we shall achieve a tremendous victory. We must leave
      this Congress with the conviction that we are ignorant of this
      business and with the resolve to start learning it from the
      bottom. After all, we have not ceased to be revolutionaries
      (although many say, and not altogether without foundation, that
      we have become bureaucrats) and can understand this simple
      thing, that in a new and unusually difficult undertaking we must
      be prepared to start from the beginning over and over again. If
      after starting you find yourselves at a dead end, start again,
      and go on doing it ten times if necessary, until you attain your
      object. Do not put on airs, do not be conceited because you are
      a Communist while there is some non-Party salesman, perhaps a
      whiteguard—and very likely he is a whiteguard—who
      can do things which economically must be done at all costs, but
      which you cannot do. If you, responsible Communists, who have
      hundreds of ranks and titles and wear communist and Soviet
      Orders, realise this, you will attain your object, because this
      is something that can be learned.

      We have some successes, even if only very tiny ones, to record
      for the past year, but they are insignificant. The main thing is
      that there is no realisation nor widespread conviction among all
      Communists that at the present time the responsible and most
      devoted Russian Communist is less able to perform these
      functions than any salesman of the old school. I repeat, we must
      start learning from the very beginning. If we realise this, we
      shall pass our test; and the test is a serious one which the
      impending financial crisis will set—the test set by the
      Russian and international market to which we are subordinated,
      with which we are connected, and from which we cannot isolate

      

      ourselves. The test is a crucial one, for here we may be beaten
      economically and politically.

      That is how the question stands and it cannot be otherwise, for
      the competition will be very severe, and it will be decisive. We
      had many outlets and loopholes that enabled us to escape from
      our political and economic difficulties. We can proudly say that
      up to now we have been able to utilise these outlets and
      loopholes in various combinations corresponding to the varying
      circumstances. But how we have no other outlets. Permit me to
      say this to you without exaggeration, because in this respect it
      is really “the last and decisive battle”, not
      against international capitalism—against that we shall yet
      have many “last and decisive battles”—but
      against Russian capitalism, against the capitalism that is
      growing out of the small peasant economy, the capitalism that is
      fostered by the latter. Here we shall have a fight on our hands
      in thc immediate future, and the date of it cannot be fixed
      exactly. Here the “last and decisive battle” is
      impending; here there are no political or any other flanking
      movements that we can undertake, because this is a test in
      competition with private capital. Either we pass this test in
      competition with private capital, or we fail completely. To help
      us pass it we have political power and a host of economic and
      other resources; we have everything you want except ability. We
      lack ability. And if we learn this simple lesson from the
      experience of last year and take it as our guiding iine for the
      whole of 1922, we shall conquer this difficulty, too, in spite
      of the fact that it is much greater than the previous
      difficulty, for it rests upon ourselves. It is not like some
      external enemy. The difficulty is that we ourselves refuse to
      admit the unpleasant truth forced upon us; we refuse to
      undertake the unpleasant duty that the situation demands of us,
      namely, to start learning from the beginning. That, in my
      opinion, is the second lesson that we must learn from the New
      Economic Policy.

      The third, supplementary lesson is on the question of state
      capitalism. It is a pity Comrade Bukharin is not present at the
      Congress. I should have liked to argue with him a little, but
      that had better be postponed to the next Congress. On the
      question of state capitalism, I think that

      

      generally our press
      and our Party make the mistake of dropping into intellectualism,
      into liberalism; we philosophise about how state capitalism is
      to be interpreted, and look into old books. But in those old
      books you will not find what we are discussing; they deal with
      the state capitalism that exists under capitalism. Not a single
      book has been written about state capitalism under communism. It
      did not occur even to Marx to write a word on thissubject; and
      he died without leaving a single precise statement or definite
      instruction on it. That is why we must overcome the difficulty
      entirely by ourselves. And if we make a general mental survey of
      our press and see what has been written about state capitalism,
      as I tried to do when I was preparing this report, we shall be
      convinced that it is missing the target, that it is looking in
      an entirely wrong direction.

      The state capitalism discussed in all books on economics is that
      which exists under the capitalist system, where the state brings
      under its direct control certain capitalist enterprises. But
      ours is a proletarian state it rests on the proletariat; it
      gives the proletariat all political privileges; and through the
      medium of the proletariat it attracts to itself the lower ranks
      of the peasantry (you remember that we began this work through
      the Poor Peasants Committees). That is why very many people are
      misled by the term state capitalism. To avoid this we must
      remember the fundamental thing that state capitalism in the form
      we have here is not dealt with in any theory, or in any books,
      for the simple reason that all the usual concepts connected with
      this term are associated with bourgeois rule in capitalist
      society. Our society is one which has left the rails of
      capitalism, but has not yot got on to new rails. The state in
      this society is not ruled by the bourgeoisie, but by the
      proletariat. We refuse to understand that when we say
      “state” we mean ourselves, the proletariat, the
      vanguard of the working class. State capitalism is capitalism
      which we shall be able to restrain, and the limits of which we
      shall be able to fix. This state capitalism is connected with
      the state, and the state is the workers, the advanced section of
      the workers, the vanguard. We are the state.



      State capitalism is capitalism that we must confine within
      certain bounds; but we have not yet learned to confine it within
      those bounds. That is the whole point. And it rests with us to
      determine what this state capitalism is to be. We have
      sufficient, quite sufficient political power; we also have
      sufficient economic resources at our command, but the vanguard
      of the working class which has been brought to the forefront to
      directly supervise, to determine the boundaries, to demarcate,
      to subordinate and not be subordinated itself, lacks sufficient
      ability for it. All that is needed here is ability, and that is
      what we do not have.

      Never before in history has there been a situation in which the
      proletariat, the revolutionary vanguard, possessed sufficient
      political power and had state capitalism existing along side
      it. The whole question turns on our understanding that this is
      the capitalism that we can and must permit, that we can and must
      confine within certain bounds; for this capitalism is essential
      for the broad masses of the peasantry and for private capital,
      which must trade in such a way as to satisfy the needs of the
      peasantry. We must organise things in such a way as to make
      possible the customary operation of capitalist economy and
      capitalist exchange, because this is essential for the
      people. Without it, existence is impossible. All the rest is not
      an absolutely vital matter to this camp. They can resign
      themselves to all that. You Communists, you workers, you, the
      politically enlightened section of the proletariat, which under
      took to administer the state, must be able to arrange it so that
      the state, which you have taken into your hands, shall function
      the way you want it to. Well, we have lived through a year, the
      state is in our hands; but has it operated the New Economic
      Policy in the way we wanted in this past year? No. But we refuse
      to admit that it did not operate in the way we wanted. How did
      it operate? The machine refused to obey the hand that guided
      it. It was like a car that was going not in the direction the
      driver desired, but in the direction someone else desired; as if
      it were being driven by some mysterious, lawless hand, God knows
      whose, perhaps of a profiteer, or of a private capitalist, or of
      both. Be that as it may, the car is not going quite in the
      direction the man at the wheel imagines, and often it goes in an
      altogether different direction.

      

      This is the main thing that must be remembered in regard to
      state capitalism. In this main field we must start learning from
      the very beginning, and only when we have thoroughly understood
      and appreciated this can we be sure that we shall learn.

      Now I come to the question of halting the retreat, a question I
      dealt with in my speech at the Congress of Metalworkers. Since
      then I have not heard any objection, either in the Party press,
      or in private letters from comrades, or in the Central
      Committee. The Central Committee approved my plan, which was,
      that in the report of the Central Committee to the present
      Congress strong emphasis should be laid on calling a halt to
      this retreat and that the Congress should give binding
      instructions on behalf of the whole Party accordingly. For a
      year we have been retreating. On behalf of the Party we must now
      call a halt. The purpose pursued by the retreat has been
      achieved. This period is drawing, or has drawn, to a close. We
      now have a different objective, that of regrouping our
      forces. We have reached a new line; on the whole, we have
      conducted the retreat in fairly good order. True, not a few
      voices were heard from various sides which tried to convert this
      retreat into a stampede. Some—for example, several members
      of the group which bore the name of Workers’ Opposition (I
      don’t think they had any right to that name)—argued
      that we were not retreating properly in some sector or
      other. Owing to their excessive zeal they found themselves at
      the wrong door, and now they realise it. At that time they did
      not see that their activities did not help us to correct our
      movement, but merely had the effect of spreading panic and
      hindering our effort to beat a disciplined retreat.

      Retreat is a difficult matter, especially for revolutionaries
      who are accustomed to advance; especially when they have been
      accustomed to advance with enormous success for several years;
      especially if they are surrounded by revolutionaries in other
      countries who are longing for the time when they can launch an
      offensive. Seeing that we were retreating, several of them burst
      into tears in a disgraceful and childish manner, as was the case
      at the last extended Plenary Meeting of the Executive Committee
      of the Communist International. Moved by the best communist
      sentiments 

      

      and communist aspirations, several of the comrades
      burst into tears because—oh horror!—the good Russian
      Communists were retreating. Perhaps it is now difficult for me
      to understand this West-European mentality, although I lived for
      quite a number of years in those marvellous democratic countries
      as an exile. Perhaps from their point of view this is such a
      difficult matter to understand that it is enough to make one
      weep. We, at any rate, have no time for sentiment. It was clear
      to us that because we had advanced so successfully for many
      years and had achieved so many extraordinary victories (and all
      this in a country that was in an appalling state of ruin and
      lacked the material resources!), to consolidate that advance,
      since we had-gained so much, it was absolutely essential for us
      to retreat. We could not hold all the positions we had captured
      in the first onslaught. On the other hand, it was because we had
      captured so much in the first onslaught, on the crest of the
      wave of enthusiasm displayed by the workers and peasants, that
      we had room enough to retreat a long distance, and can retreat
      still further now, without losing our main and fundamental
      positions. On the whole, the retreat was fairly orderly,
      although certain panic-stricken voices, among them that of the
      Workers’ Opposition (this was the tremendous harm it
      did!), caused losses in our ranks, caused a relaxation of
      discipline, and disturbed the proper order of retreat. The most
      dangerous thing during a retreat is panic. When a whole army (I
      speak in the figurative sense) is in retreat, it cannot have the
      same morale as when it is advancing. At every step you find a
      certain mood of depression. We even had poets who wrote that
      people were cold and starving in Moscow, that “everything
      before was bright and beautiful, but now trade and profiteering
      abound”. We have had quite a number of poetic effusions of
      this sort.

      Of course, retreat breeds all this. That is where the serious
      danger lies; it is terribly difficult to retreat after a great
      victorious advance, for the relations are entirely
      different. During a victorious advance, even if discipline is
      relaxed, everybody presses forward on his own accord. During a
      retreat, however, discipline must be more conscious and is a
      hundred times more necessary, because, when the entire army is
      in retreat, it does not know or see where it should halt.

      

      It sees only retreat; under such circumstances a few
      panic-stricken voices are, at times, enough to cause a
      stampede. The danger here is enormous. When a real army is in
      retreat, machine-guns are kept ready, and when an orderly
      retreat degenerates into a disorderly one, the command to fire
      is given, and quite rightly, too.

      If, during an incredibly difficult retreat, when everything
      depends on preserving proper order, anyone spreads
      panic—even from the best of motives—the slightest
      breach of discipline must be punished severely, sternly,
      ruthlessly; and this applies not only to certain of our internal
      Party affairs, but also, and to a greater extent, to such gentry
      as the Mensheviks, and to all the gentry of the Two-and-a-Half
      International.

      The other day I read an article by Comrade Rakosi in No. 20 of
      The Communist International on a new book by Otto
      Bauer, from whom at one time we all learned, but who, like
      Kautsky, became a miserable petty bourgeois after the war.[2] Bauer now writes: “There, they
      are now retreating to capitalism! We have always said that it
      was a bourgeois revolution.”

      And the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, all of whom
      preach this sort of thing, are astonished when we declare that
      we shall shoot people for such things. They are amazed; but
      surely it is clear. When an army is in retreat a hundred times
      more discipline is required than when it is advancing, because
      during an advance everybody presses forward. If everybody
      started rushing back now, it would spell immediate and
      inevitable disaster.

      The most important thing at such a moment is to retreat in good
      order, to fix the precise limits of the retreat, and not to give
      way to panic. And when a Menshevik says, “You are now
      retreating; I have been advocating retreat all the time, I agree
      with you, I am your man, let us retreat together,” we say
      in reply, “For the public manifestations of Menshevism our
      revolutionary courts must pass the death sentence, otherwise
      they are not our courts, but God knows what.”

      They cannot understand this and exclaim: “What dictatorial
      manners these people have!” They still think we are
      persecuting the Mensheviks because they fought us in Geneva.[3] But had we done that we should have
      been unable

      

      to hold power even for two months. Indeed, the
      sermons which Otto Bauer, the leaders of the Second and
      Two-and-a Half Internationals, the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries preach express their true
      nature—“The revolution has gone too far. What you
      are saying now we have been saying all the time, permit us to
      say it again.” But we say in reply: “Permit us to
      put you before a firing squad for saying that. Either you
      refrain from expressing your views, or, if you insist on
      expressing your political views publicly in the present
      circumstances, when our position is far more difficult than it
      was when the whiteguards were directly attacking us, then you
      will have only yourselves to blame if we treat you as the worst
      and most pernicious whiteguard elements.” We must never
      forget this.

      When I speak about halting the retreat I do not mean that we
      have learned to trade. On the contrary, I am of the opposite
      opinion; and if my speech were to create that impression it
      would show that I had been misunderstood and that I am unable to
      express my thoughts properly.

      The point, however, is that we must put a stop to the
      nervousness and fuss that have arisen with the introduction of
      NEP—the desire to do everything in a new way and to adapt
      everything. We now have a number of mixed companies. True, we
      have only very few. There are nine companies formed in
      conjunction with foreign capitalists and sanctioned by the
      Commissariat of Foreign Trade. The Sokolnikov 

      Commission[4]

      has sanctioned six and the Northern
      Timber 

      Trust[5]

      has sanctioned two. Thus we now have
      seventeen companies with an aggregate capital amounting to many
      millions, sanctioned by several government departments (of
      course, there is plenty of confusion with all these departments,
      so that some slip here is also possible). At any rate we have
      formed companies jointly with Russian and foreign
      capitalists. There are only a few of them. But this small but
      practical start shows that the Communists have been judged by
      what they do. They have not been judged by such high
      institutions as the Central Control Commission and the
      All-Russia Central Executive Committee. The Central Control
      Commission is a splendid institution, of course, and we shall
      now give it more power. For all that, the judgement these
      institutions pass on Communists is not--just

      

      imagine—recognised on the international
      market. (Laughter.) But now that ordinary Russian and
      foreign capitalists are joining the Communists in forming mixed
      companies, we say, “We can do things after all; bad as it
      is, meagre as it is, we have got something for a start.”
      True, it is not very much. Just think of it: a year has passed
      since we declared that we would devote all our energy (and it is
      said that we have a great deal of energy) to this matter, and in
      this year we have managed to form only seventeen companies.

      This shows how devilishly clumsy and inept we are; how much
      Oblomovism still remains, for which we shall inevitably get a
      good thrashing. For all that, I repeat, a start, a
      reconnaissance has been made. The capitalists would not agree to
      have dealings with us if the elementary conditions for their
      operations did not exist. Even if only a very small section of
      them has agreed to this, it shows that we have scored a partial
      victory.

      Of course, they will cheat us in these companics, cheat us so
      that it will take several years before matters are straightened
      out. But that does not matter. I do not say that that is a
      victory; it is a reconnaissance, which shows that we have an
      arena, we have a terrain, and can now stop the retreat.

      The reconnaissance has revealed that we have concluded an
      insignificant number of agreements with capitalists; but we have
      concluded them for all that. We must learn from that and
      continue our operations. In this sense we must put a stop to
      nervousness, screaming and fuss. We received notes and telephone
      messages, one after another asking, “Now that we have NEP,
      may we be reorganised too?” Everybody is bustling, and we
      get utter confusion, nobody is doing any practical work;
      everybody is continuously arguing about how to adapt oneself to
      NEP, but no practical results are forthcoming. 

      The merchants are laughing at us Communists, and in all
      probability are saying, “Formerly there were
      Persuaders-in-Chief,[6] now we have Talkers-in-Chief.”
      That the capitalists gloated over the fact that we started late,
      that we were not sharp enough—of that there need not be
      the slightest doubt. In this sense, I say, these instructions
      must be endorsed in the name of the Congress.



      The retreat is at an end. The principal methods of operation, of
      how we are to work with the capitalists, are outlined. We have
      examples, even if an insignificant number.

      Stop philosophising and arguing about NEP. Let the poets write
      verses, that is what they are poets for. But you economists, you
      stop arguing about NEP and get more companies formed; check up
      on how many Communists we have who can organise successful
      competition with the capitalists.

      The retreat has come to an end; it is now a matter of regrouping
      our forces. These are the instructions that the Congress must
      pass so as to put an end to fuss and bustle. Calm down, do not
      philosophise; if you do, it will be counted as a black mark
      against you. Show by your practical efforts that you can work no
      less efficiently than the capitalists. The capitalists create an
      economic link with the peasants in order to amass wealth; you
      must create a link with peasant economy in order to strengthen
      the economic power of our proletarian state. You have the
      advantage over the capitalists in that political power is in
      your hands; you have a number of economic weapons at your
      command; the only trouble is that you cannot make proper use of
      them. Look at things more soberly. Cast off the tinsel, the
      festive communist garments, learn a simple thing simply, and we
      shall beat the private capitalist. We possess political power;
      we possess a host of economic weapons. If we beat capitalism and
      create a link with peasant farming we shall become an absolutely
      invincible power. Then the building of socialism will not be the
      task of that drop in the ocean, called the Communist Party, but
      the task of the entire mass of the working people. Then the
      rank-and-file peasants will see that we are helping them and
      they will follow our lead. Consequently, even if the pace is a
      hundred times slower, it will be a million times more certain
      and more sure.

      It is in this sense that we must speak of halting the retreat;
      and the proper thing to do is, in one way or another, to make
      this slogan a Congress decision.

      In this connection, I should like to deal with the question:
      what is the Bolsheviks’ New Economic
      Policy—evolution or tactics? This question has been raised
      by the Smena Vekh people, who, as you know, are a trend
      which has arisen among Russian Ã©migrÃ©s; it is a socio-political
      trend led by some 

      

      of the most prominent
      Constitutional-Democrats, several Ministers of the former
      Kolchak government, people who have come to the conclusion that
      the Soviet government is building up the Russian state and
      therefore should be supported. They argue as follows:
      “What sort of state is the Soviet government building? The
      Communists say they are building a communist state and assure us
      that the new policy is a matter of tactics: the Bolsheviks are
      making use of the private capitalists in a difficult situation,
      but later they will get the upper hand. The Bolsheviks can say
      what they like; as a matter of fact it is not tactics but
      evolution, internal regeneration; they will arrive at the
      ordinary bourgeois state, and we must support them. History
      proceeds in devious ways.”

      Some of them pretend to be Communists; but there are others who
      are more straightforward, one of these is Ustryalov. I think he
      was a Minister in Kolchak’s government. He does not agree
      with his colleagues and says: “You can think what you like
      about communism, but I maintain that it is not a matter of
      tactics, but of evolution.” I think that by being
      straightforward like this, Ustryalov is rendering us a great
      service. We, and I particularly, because of my position, hear a
      lot of sentimental communist lies; “communist
      fibbing”, every day, and sometimes we get sick to death of
      them. But now instead of these “communist fibs” I
      get a copy of Smena Vekh, which says quite plainly:
      “Things are by no means what you imagine them to be. As a
      matter of fact, you are slipping into the ordinary bourgeois
      morass with communist flags inscribed with catchwords stuck all
      over the place.” This is very useful. It is not a
      repetition of what we are constantly hearing around us, but the
      plain class truth uttered by the class enemy. It is very useful
      to read this sort of thing; and it was written not because the
      communist state allows you to write some things and not others,
      but because it really is the class truth, bluntly and frankly
      uttered by the class enemy. “I am in favour of supporting
      the Soviet government,” says Ustryalov, although he was a
      Constitutional-Democrat, a bourgeois, and supported
      intervention. “I am in favour of supporting Soviet power
      because it has taken the road that will lead it to the ordinary
      bourgeois state.”



      This is very useful, and I think that we must keep it in
      mind. It is much better for us if the Smena Vekh people
      write in that strain than if some of them pretend to be almost
      Communists, so that from a distance one cannot tell whether they
      believe in God or in the communist revolution. We must say
      frankiy that such candid enemies are useful. We must say frankly
      that the things Ustryalov speaks about are possible. History
      knows all sorts of metamorphoses. Relying on firmness of
      convictions, loyalty, and other splendid moral qualities is
      anything but a serious attitude in politics. A few people may be
      endowed with splendid moral qualities, but historical issues are
      decided by vast masses, which, if the few do not suit them, may
      at times treat them none too politely.

      There have been many cases of this kind; that is why we must
      welcome this frank utterance of the Smena Vekh
      people. The enemy is speaking the class truth and is pointing to
      the danger that confronts us, and which the enemy is striving to
      make inevitable. Smena Vekh adherents express the
      sentiments of thousands and tens of thousands of bourgeois, or
      of Soviet employees whose function it is to operate our New
      Economic Policy. This is the real and main danger. And that is
      why attention must be concentrated mainly on the question:
      “Who will win?” I have spoken about competition. No
      direct onslaught is being made on us now; nobody is clutching us
      by the throat. True, we have yet to see what will bappen
      tomorrow; but today we are not being subjected to armed
      attack. Nevertheless, the fight against capitalist society has
      become a hundred times more fierce and perilous, because we are
      not always able to tell enemies from friends.

      When I spoke about communist competition, what I had in mind
      were not communist sympathies but the development of economic
      forms and social systems. This is not competition but, if not
      the last, then nearly the last, desperate, furious,
      life-and-death struggle between capitalism and communism.

      And here we must squarely put the question: Wherein lies our
      strength and what do we lack? We have quite enough political
      power. I hardly think there is anyone here who will assert that
      on such-and-such a practical question, in such and-such a
      business institution, the Communists, the

      

      Communist Party, lack
      sufficient power. There are people who think only of this, but
      these people are hopelessly looking backward and cannot
      understand that one must look ahead. The main economic power is
      in our hands. All the vital large enterprises, the railways,
      etc., are in our hands. The number of leased enterprises,
      although considerable in places, is on the whole insignificant;
      altogether it is infinitesimal compared with the rest. The
      economic power in the hands of the proletarian state of Russia
      is quite adequate to ensure the transition to communism. What
      then is lacking? Obviously, what is lacking is culture among the
      stratum of the Communists who perform administrative
      functions. If we take Moscow with its 4,700 Communists in
      responsible positions, and if we take that huge bureaucratic
      machine, that gigantic heap, we must ask: who is directing whom?
      I doubt very much whether it can truthfully be said that the
      Communists are directing that heap. To tell the truth they are
      not directing, they are being directed. Some thing analogous
      happened here to what we were told in our history lessons when
      we were children: sometimes one nation conquers another, the
      nation that conquers is the conqueror and the nation that is
      vanquished is the conquered nation. This is simple and
      intelligible to all. But what happens to the culture of these
      nations? Here things are not so simple. If the conquering nation
      is more cultured than the vanquished nation, the former imposes
      its culture upon the latter; but if the opposite is the case,
      the vanquished nation imposes its culture upon the
      conqueror. Has not something like this happened in the capital
      of the R.S.F.S.R.? Have the 4,700 Communists (nearly a whole
      army division, and all of them the very best) come under the
      influence of an alien culture? True, there may be the impression
      that the vanquished have a high level of culture. But that is
      not the case at all. Their culture is miserable, insignificant,
      but it is still at a higher level than ours. Miserable and low
      as it is, it is higher than that of our responsible Communist
      administrators, for the latter lack administrative
      ability. Communists who are put at the head of
      departments—and sometimes artful saboteurs
      deliberately put them in these positions in order to use them as
      a shield—are often fooled. This is a very unpleasant
      admission to make, or, at any rate, not a

      

      very pleasant one; but
      I think we must admit it, for at present this is the salient
      problem. I think that this is the political lesson of the past
      year; and it is around this that the struggle will rage in
      1922.

      Will the responsible Communists of the R.S.F.S.R. and of the
      Russian Communist Party realise that they cannot administer;
      that they only imagine they are directing, but are, actually,
      being directed? If they realise this they will learn, of course;
      for this business can be learnt. But one must study hard to
      learn it, and our people are not doing this. They scatter orders
      and decrees right and left, but the result is quite different
      from what they want.

      The competition and rivalry that we have placed on the order of
      the day by proclaiming NEP is a serious business. It appears to
      be going on in all government offices; but as a matter of fact
      it is one more form of the struggle between two irreconcilably
      hostile classes. It is another form of the struggle between the
      bourgeoisie and the proletariat. It is a struggle that has not
      yet been brought to a head, and culturally it has not yet been
      resolved even in the central government departments in
      Moscow. Very often the bourgeois officials know the business
      better than our best Communists, who are invested with authority
      and have every opportunity, but who cannot make the slightest
      use of their rights and authority. 

      I should like to quote a passage from a pamphlet by Alexander
      Todorsky.[7] It was published in Vesyegonsk
      (there is an uyezd town of that name in Tver Gubernia) on the
      first anniversary of the Soviet revolution in Russia, on
      November 7, 1918, a long, long time ago. Evidently this
      Vesyegonsk comrade is a member of the Party—I read the
      pamphlet a long time ago and cannot say for certain. He
      describes how he set to work to equip two Soviet factories, and
      for this purpose enlisted the services of two bourgeois. He did
      this in the way these things were done at that
      time—threatened to imprison them and to confiscate all
      their property. They were enlisted for the task of restoring the
      factories. We know how the services of the bourgeoisie were
      enlisted in 1918 (laughter ); so there is no need for
      me to go into details. The methods we are now using to enlist
      the bourgeoisie are different. But here is the conclusion he
      arrived at: “This is only half the job. It is not enough
      to defeat the bourgeoisie,

      

      to overpower them; they must be
      compelled to work for us.”

      Now these are remarkable words. They are remarkable for they
      show that even in the town of Vesyegonsk, even in 1918, there
      were people who had a correct understanding of the relationship
      between the victorious proletariat and the vanquished
      bourgeoisie.

      When we rap the exploiters’ knuckles, render them
      innocuous, overpower them, it is only half the job. In Moscow,
      however, ninety out of a hundred responsible officials imagine
      that all we have to do is to overpower, render innocuous and rap
      knuckles. What I have said about the Mensheviks,
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and whiteguards is very often inter
      preted solely as rendering innocuous, rapping knuckles (and,
      perhaps, not only the knuckles, but some other place) and
      overpowering. But that is only half the job. It was only half
      the job even in 1918, when this was written by the Vesyegonsk
      comrade; now it is even less than one-fourth. We must make these
      hands work for us, and not have responsible Communists at the
      head of departments, enjoying rank and title, but actually
      swimming with the stream together with the bourgeoisie. That is
      the whole point.

      The idea of building communist society exclusively with the
      hands of the Communists is childish, absolutely childish. We
      Communists are but a drop in the ocean, a drop in the ocean of
      the people. We shall be able to lead the people along the road
      we have chosen only if we correctly determine it not only from
      the standpoint of its direction in world history. From that
      point of view we have determined the road quite correctly, and
      this is corroborated by the situation in every country. We must
      also determine it correctly for our own native land, for our
      country. But the direction in world history is not the only
      factor. Other factors are whether there will be intervention or
      not, and whether we shall be able to supply the peasants with
      goods in exchange for their grain. The peasants will say:
      “You are splendid fellows; you defended our country. That
      is why we obeyed you. But if you cannot run the show, get
      out!” Yes, that is what the peasants will say.

      We Communists shall be able to direct our economy if we succeed
      in utilising the hands of the bourgeoisie in building

      

      up this
      economy of ours and in the meantime learn from these bourgeoisie
      and guide them along the road we want them to travel. But when a
      Communist imagines that he knows everything, when he says:
      “I am a responsible Communist, I have beaten enemies far
      more formidable than any salesman. We have fought at the front
      and have beaten far more formidable enemies”—it is
      this prevailing mood that is doing us great harm.

      Rendering the exploiters innocuous, rapping them over the
      knuckles, clipping their wings is the least important part of
      the job. That must be done; and our State Political
      Administration and our courts must do it more vigorously than
      they have up to now. They must remember that they are
      proletarian courts surrounded by enemies the world over. This is
      not difficult; and in the main we have learned to do it. Here a
      certain amount of pressure must be exercised; but that is
      easy.

      To win the second part of the victory, i.e., to build communism
      with the hands of non-Communists, to acquire the practical
      ability to do what is economically necessary, we must establish
      a link with peasant farming; we must satisfy the peasant, so
      that he will say: “Hard, bitter and painful as starvation
      is, I see a government that is an unusual one, is no ordinary
      one, but is doing something practically useful, something
      tangible.” We must see to it that the numerous elements
      with whom we are co-operating, and who far exceed us in number,
      work in such a way as to enable us to supervise them; we must
      learn to understand this work, and direct their hands so that
      they do something useful for communism. This is the key point of
      the present situation; for although individual Communists have
      understood and realised that it is necessary to enlist the
      non-Party people for this work, the rank-and-file of our Party
      have not. Many circulars have been written, much has been said
      about this, but has anything been accomplished during the past
      year? Nothing. Not five Party committees out of a hundred can
      show practical results. This shows how much we lag behind the
      requirements of the present time; how much we are still living
      in the traditions of 1918 and 1919. Those were great years; a
      great historical task was then accomplished. But if we only look
      back on those years and do not

      

      see the task that now confronts
      us, we shall be doomed, certainly and absolutely. And the whole
      point is that we refuse to admit it.

      I should now like to give two practical examples to illustrate
      how we administer. I have said already that it would be more
      correct to take one of the state trusts as an example, but I
      must ask you to excuse me for not being able to apply this
      proper method, for to do so it would have been necessary to
      study the concrete material concerning at least one state
      trust. Unfortunately, I have been unable to do that, and so I
      will take two small examples. One example is the accusation of
      bureaucracy levelled at the People’s Commissariat of
      Foreign Trade by the Moscow Consumers’ Co-operative
      Society. The other example I will take from the Donets
      Basin.

      The first example is not quite relevant—I am unable to
      find a better—but it will serve to illustrate my main
      point. As you know from the newspapers, I have been unable to
      deal with affairs directly during these past few months. I have
      not been attending the Council of People’s Commissars, or
      the Central Committee. During the short and rare visits I made
      to Moscow I was struck by the desperate and terrible complaints
      levelled at the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Trade. I
      have never doubted for a moment that the People’s
      Commissariat of Foreign Trade functions badly and that it is
      tied up with red tape. But when the complaints became
      particularly bitter I tried to investigate the matter, to take a
      concrete example and for once get to the bottom of it; to
      ascertain the cause, to ascertain why the machine was not
      working properly.

      The M.C.C.S. wanted to purchase a quantity of canned goods. A
      French citizen appeared and offered some. I do not know whether
      he did it in the interests of the international policy and with
      the knowledge of the leadership of the Entente countries, or
      with the approval of PoincarÃ© and the other enemies of the
      Soviet government (I think our historians will investigate and
      make this clear after the Genoa Conference), but the fact is
      that the French bourgeoisie took not only a theoretical, but
      also a practical interest in this business, as a French
      bourgeois turned up in Moscow with an offer of canned
      goods. Moscow is starving; in the summer 

      

      the situation will be
      worse; no meat has been delivered, and knowing the merits of our
      People’s Commissariat of Railways, probably none will be
      delivered.

      An offer is made to sell canned meat for Soviet currency
      (whether the meat is entirely bad or not will be established by
      a future investigation). What could be simpler? But if the
      matter is approached in the Soviet way, it turns out to be not
      so simple after all. I was unable to go into the matter
      personally, but I ordered an investigation and I have before me
      the report which shows how this celebrated case developed. It
      started with the decision adopted on February 11 by the
      Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian
      Communist Party on the report of Comrade Kamenev concerning the
      desirability of purchasing food abroad. Of course, how could a
      Russian citizen decide such a question without the consent of
      the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian
      Communist Party! Think of it! How could 4,700 responsible
      officials (and this is only according to the census) decide a
      matter like purchasing food abroad without the consent of the
      Political Bureau of the Central Committee? This would be
      something supernatural, of course. Evidently, Comrade Kamenev
      understands our policy and the realities of our position
      perfectly well, and therefore, he did not place too much
      reliance on the numerous responsible officials. He started by
      taking the bull by the horns—if not the bull, at all
      events the Political Bureau—and without any difficulty (I
      did not hear that there was any discussion over the matter)
      obtained a resolution stating: “To call the attention of
      the People’s Commissariat of Foreign Trade to the
      desirability of importing food from abroad; the import duties
      . . . “, etc. The attention of the People’s
      Commissariat of Foreign Trade was drawn to this. Things started
      moving. This was on February 11. I remember that I had occasion
      to be in Moscow at the very end of February, or about that time,
      and what did I find? The complaints, the despairing complaints
      of the Moscow comrades. “What’s the matter?” I
      ask. “There is no way we can buy these provisions.”
      “Why?” “Because of the red tape of the
      People’s Commissariat of Foreign Trade.” I had not
      been taking part in affairs for a long time and I did not know
      that the Political Bureau had adopted a decision on the

      

      matter. I merely ordered the Executive Secretary of our Council
      to investigate, procure the relevant documents and show them to
      me. The matter was settled when Krasin arrived. Kamenev
      discussed the matter with him; the transaction was arranged, and
      the canned meat was purchased. All’s well that ends
      well.

      I have not the least doubt that Kamenev and Krasin can come to
      an understanding and correctly determine the political line
      desired by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
      Russian Communist Party. If the political line on commercial
      matters were decided by Kamenev and Krasin, ours would be the
      best Soviet Republic in the world. But Kamenev, a member of the
      Political Bureau, and Krasin—the latter is busy with
      diplomatic affairs connected with Genoa, affairs which have
      entailed an enormous, an excessive amount of labour—cannot
      be dragged into every transaction, dragged into the business of
      buying canned goods from a French citizen. That is not the way
      to work. This is not new, not economic, and not a policy, but
      sheer mockery. Now I have the report of the investigation into
      this matter. In fact, I have two reports: one, the report of the
      investigation made by Gorbunov, the Executive Secretary of thc
      Council of People’s Commissars, and his assistant,
      Miroshnikov; and the other, the report of the investigation made
      by the State Political Administration. I do not know why the
      latter interested itself in the matter, and I am not quite sure
      whether it was proper for it to do so; but I will not go into
      that now, because I am afraid this might entail another
      investigation. The important thing is that material on the
      matter has been collected and I now have it before me.

      On arriving in Moscow at the end of February I heard bitter
      complaints, “We cannot buy the canned goods”,
      although in Libau there was a ship with a cargo of canned goods,
      and the owners were prepared to take Soviet currency for real
      canned goods! (Laughter.) If these canned goods are not
      entirely bad (and I now emphasise the “if”, because
      I am not sure that I shall not call for another investigation,
      the results of which, however, we shall have to report at the
      next Congress), if, I say, these goods are not entirely bad and
      they have been purchased, I ask: why could not

      

      this matter have
      been settled without Kamenev and Krasin? From the report I have
      before me I gather that one responsible Communist sent another
      responsible Communist to the devil. I also gather from this
      report that one responsible Communist said to another
      responsible Communist: “From now on I shall not talk to
      you except in the presence of a lawyer.” Reading this
      report I recalled the time when I was in exile in Siberia,
      twenty-five years ago, and had occasion to act in the capacity
      of a lawyer. I was not a certified lawyer, because, being
      summarily exiled, I was not allowed to practise; but as there
      was no other lawyer in the region, people came and confided
      their troubles to me. But sometimes I had the greatest
      difficulty in understanding what the trouble was. A woman would
      come and, of course, start telling me a long story about her
      relatives, and it was incredibly difficult to get from her what
      she really wanted. I said to her: “Bring me a copy.”
      She went on with her endless and pointless story. When I
      repeated, “Bring me a copy”, she left, complaining:
      “He won’t hear what I have to say unless I bring a
      copy.” In our colony we had a hearty laugh over this
      copy. I was able, however, to make some progress. People came to
      me, brought copies of the necessary documents, and I was able to
      gather what their trouble was, what they complained of, what
      ailed them. This was twenty five years ago, in Siberia, in a
      place many hundreds of versts from the nearest railway
      station.

      But why was it necessary, three years after the revolution, in
      the capital of the Soviet Republic, to have two investigations,
      the intervention of Kamenev and Krasin and the in structions of
      the Political Bureau to purchase canned goods? What was lacking?
      Political power? No. The money was forth coming, so they had
      economic as well as political power. All the necessary
      institutions were available. What was lacking, then?
      Culture. Ninety-nine out of every hundred officials of the
      M.C.C.S.—against whom I have no complaint to make
      whatever, and whom I regard as excellent Communists—and of
      the Commissariat of Foreign Trade lack culture. They were unable
      to approach the matter in a cultured manner.

      When I first heard of the matter I sent the following written
      proposal to the Central Committee: “All the officials

      

      concerned of the Moscow government departments—except the
      members of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, who, as
      you know, enjoy immunity—should be put in the worst prison
      in Moscow for six hours, and those of the People’s
      Commissariat of Foreign Trade for thirty-six hours.” And
      then it turned out that no one could say who the culprits were
      (laughter ), and from what I have told you it is
      evident that the culprits will never be discovered. It is simply
      the usual inability of the Russian intellectuals to get things
      done—inefficiency and slovenliness. First they rush at a
      job, do a little bit, and then think about it, and when nothing
      comes of it, they run to complain to Kamenev and want the matter
      to be brought before the Political Bureau. Of course, all
      difficult state problems should be brought before the Political
      Bureau—I shall have to say something about that later
      on—but one should think first and then act. If you want to
      bring up a case, submit the appropriate documents. First send a
      telegram, and in Moscow we also have telephones; send a
      telephone message to the competent department and a copy to
      Tsyurupa saying: I regard the transaction as urgent and will
      take proceedings against anyone guilty of red tape.” One
      must think of this elementary culture, one must approach things
      in a thoughtful manner. If the business is not settled in the
      course of a few minutes, by telephone, collect the documents and
      say: “If you start any of your red tape I shall have you
      clapped in gaol.” But not a moment’s thought is
      given to the matter, there is no preparation, the usual bustle,
      several commissions, everybody is tired out, exhausted, run
      down, and things begin to move only when Kamenev is put in touch
      with Krasin. AlI this is typical of what goes on not only in the
      capital, Moscow, but also in the other capitals, in the capitals
      of all independent republics and regions. And the same thing,
      even a hundred times worse, constantly goes on in the provincial
      towns.

      In our struggle we must remember that Communists must be able to
      reason. They may be perfectly familiar with the revolutionary
      struggle and with the state of the revolutionary movement all
      over the world; but if we are to extricate ourselves from
      desperate poverty and want we need culture, integrity and an
      ability to reason. Many lack these qualities.

      

      It would be unfair
      to say that the responsible Communists do not fulfil their
      functions conscientiously. The overwhelming majority of them,
      ninety-nine out of a hundred, are not only
      conscientious—they proved their devotion to the revolution
      under the most difficult conditions before the fall of tsarism
      and after the revolution; they were ready to lay down their
      lives. Therefore, it would be radically wrong to attribute the
      trouble to lack of conscientiousness. We need a cultured
      approach to the simplest affairs of state. We must all
      understand that this is a matter of state, a business matter;
      and if obstacles arise we must be able to overcome them and take
      proceedings against those who are guilty of red tape. We have
      proletarian courts in Moscow; they must bring to account the
      persons who are to blame for the failure to effect the purchase
      of several tens of thousands of poods of canned food. I think
      the proletarian courts will be able to punish the guilty; but in
      order to punish, the culprits must be found. I assure you that
      in this case no culprits will be found. I want you all to look
      into this business: no one is guilty; all we see is a lot of
      fuss and bustle and nonsense. Nobody has the ability to approach
      the business properly; nobody understands that affairs of state
      must not be tackled in this way. And all the whiteguards and
      saboteurs take advantage of this. At one time we waged
      a fierce struggle against the saboteurs ; that struggle
      confronts us even now. There are saboteurs today, of
      course, and they must be fought. But can we fight them when the
      position is as I have just described it? This is worse than any
      sabotage. The saboteur could wish for nothing better
      than that two Communists should argue over the question of when
      to appeal to the Political Bureau for instructions on principles
      in buying food; and of course he would soon slip in between them
      and egg them on. If any intelligent saboteur were to
      stand behind these Communists, or behind each of them in turn,
      and encourage them, that would be the end. The matter would be
      doomed for ever. Who is to blame? Nobody, because two
      responsible Communists, devoted revolutionaries, are arguing
      over last year’s snow; are arguing over the question of
      when to appeal to the Political Bureau for instructions on
      principles in buying food.

      That is how the matter stands and that is the difficulty 

      

      that
      confronts us. Any salesman trained in a large capitalist
      enterprise knows how to settle a matter like that; but
      ninety-nine responsible Communists out of a hundred do not. And
      they refuse to understand that they do not know how and that
      they must learn the ABC of this business. Unless we realise
      this, unless we sit down in the preparatory class again, we
      shall never be able to solve the economic problem that now lies
      at the basis of our entire policy.

      The other example I wanted to give you is that of the Donets
      Basin. You know that this is the centre, the real basis of our
      entire economy. It will be utterly impossible to restore
      large-scale industry in Russia, to really build
      socialism—for it can only be built on the basis of large
      scale industry—unless we restore the Donets Basin and
      bring it up to the proper level. The Central Committee is
      closely watching developments there.

      As regards this region there was no unjustified, ridiculous or
      absurd raising of minor questions in the Political Bureau; real,
      absolutely urgent business was discussed.

      The Central Committee ought to see to it that in such real
      centres, bases and foundations of our entire economy, work is
      carried on in a real business-like manner. At the head of the
      Central Coal Industry Board we had not only undoubtedly devoted,
      but really educated and very capable people. I should not be
      wrong even if I said talented people. That is why the Central
      Committee has concentrated its attention on it. The Ukraine is
      an independent republic. That is quite all right. But in Party
      matters it sometimes—what is the politest way of saying
      it?—takes a roundabout course, and we shall have to get at
      them. For the people in charge there are sly, and their Central
      Committee I shall not say deceives us, but somehow edges away
      from us. To obtain a general view of the whole business, we
      discussed it in the Central Committee here and discovered that
      friction and disagreement exist. There is a Commission for the
      Utilisation of Small Mines there and, of course, severe friction
      between it and the Central Coal Industry Board. Still we, the
      Central Committee, have a certain amount of experience and we
      unanimously decided not to remove the leading people, but if
      there was any friction it was to be reported to us, down to the
      smallest detail. For since we have not only devoted but capable
      people in the region, we must back them up, and enable them to
      complete their training, assuming that they have not done so. In
      the end, a Party Congress was held in the Ukraine—I do not
      know what happened there; all sorts of things happened. I asked
      for information from the Ukrainian comrades, and I asked Comrade
      Orjonikidze particularly—and the Central Committee did the
      same—to go down there and ascertain what had
      happened. Evidently, there was some intrigue and an awful mess,
      which the Commission on Party History would not be able to clear
      up in ten years should it undertake to do so. But the upshot of
      it all was that contrary to the unanimous instructions of the
      Central Committee, this group was superseded by another
      group. What was the matter? In the main, notwithstanding all its
      good qualities, a section of the group made a mistake. They were
      overzealous in their methods of administration. There we have to
      deal with workers. Very often the word “workers” is
      taken to mean the factory proletariat. But it does not mean that
      at all. During the war people who were by no means proletarians
      went into the factories; they went into the factories to dodge
      the war. Are the social and economic conditions in our country
      today such as to induce real proletarians to go into the
      factories? No. It would be true according to Marx; but Marx did
      not write about Russia; he wrote about capitalism as a whole,
      beginning with the fifteenth century. It held true over a period
      of six hundred years, but it is not true for present-day
      Russia. Very often those who go into the factories are not
      proletarians; they are casual elements of every description.

      The task is to learn to organise the work properly, not to lag
      behind, to remove friction in time, not to separate
      administration from politics. For our administration and our
      politics rest on the ability of the entire vanguard to maintain
      contact with the entire mass of the proletariat and with the
      entire mass of the peasantry. If anybody forgets these cogs and
      becomes wholly absorbed in administration, the result will be a
      disastrous one. The mistake the Donets Basin officials made is
      insignificant compared with other mistakes of ours, but this
      example is a typical one. The Central Committee unanimously
      ordered: “Allow this group to remain; bring all conflicts,
      even minor ones, before the

      

      Central Committee, for the Donets
      Basin is not an ordinary district, but a vital one, without
      which socialist construction would simply remain a pious
      wish.” But all our political power, all the authority of
      the Central Committee proved of no avail.

      This time there was a mistake in administration, of course; in
      addition, a host of other mistakes were made.

      This instance shows that it is not a matter of possessing
      political power, but of administrative ability, the ability to
      put the right man in the right place, the ability to avoid petty
      conflicts, so that state economic work may be carried on without
      interruption. This is what we lack; this is the root of the
      mistake.

      I think that in discussing our revolution and weighing up its
      prospects, we must carefully single out the problems which the
      revolution has solved completely and which have irrevocably gone
      down in history as an epoch-making departure from
      capitalism. Our revolution has such solutions to its credit. Let
      the Mensheviks and Otto Bauer of the Two-and-a-Half
      International shout: “Theirs is a bourgeois
      revolution.” We say that our task was to consummate the
      bourgeois revolution. As a certain whiteguard newspaper
      expressed it: Dung had accumulated in our state institutions for
      four hundred years; but we cleaned it all out in four
      years. This is the great service we rendered. What have the
      Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries done? Nothing. The dung
      of medievalism has not been cleared out either in our country,
      or even in advanced, enlightened Germany. Yet they reproach us
      for doing what stands very much to our credit. The fact that we
      have consummated the revolution is an achievement that can never
      be expunged from our record.

      War is now in the air. The trade unions, for example, the
      reformist trade unions, are passing resolutions against war and
      are threatening to call strikes in opposition to war. Recently,
      if I am not mistaken, I read a report in the newspapers to the
      effect that a certain very good Communist delivered an anti-war
      speech in the French Chamber of Deputies in the course of which
      he stated that the workers would prefer to rise in revolt rather
      than go to war. This question cannot be formulated in the way we
      formulated it in 1912, when the Basle Manifesto was issued. The
      Russian

      

      revolution alone has shown how it is possible to emerge
      from war, and what effort this entails. It showed what emerging
      from a reactionary war by revolutionary methods
      means. Reactionary imperialist wars are inevitable in all parts
      of the world; and in solving problems of this sort mankind
      cannot and will not forget that tens of millions were
      slaughtered then, and will be slaughtered again if war breaks
      out. We are living in the twentieth century, and the only nation
      that emerged from a reactionary war by revolutionary methods not
      for the benefit of a particular government, but by overthrowing
      it, was the Russian nation, and it was the Russian revolution
      that extricated it. What has been won by the Russian revolution
      is irrevocable. No power on earth can erase that; nor can any
      power on earth erase the fact that the Soviet state has been
      created. This is a historic victory. For hundreds of years
      states have been built according to the bourgeois model, and for
      the first time a non-bourgeois form of state has been
      discovered. Our machinery of government may be faulty, but it is
      said that the first steam engine that was invented was also
      faulty. No one even knows whether it worked or not, but that is
      not the important point; the important point is that it was
      invented. Even assuming that the first steam engine was of no
      use, the fact is that we now have steam engines. Even if our
      machinery of government is very faulty, the fact remains that it
      has been created; the greatest invention in history has been
      made; a proletarian type of state has been created. Therefore,
      let all Europe, let thousands of bourgeois newspapers broadcast
      news about the horrors and poverty that prevail in our country,
      about suffering being the sole lot of the working people in our
      country; the workers all over the world are still drawn towards
      the Soviet state. These are the great and irrevocable gains that
      we have achieved. But for us, members of the Communist Party,
      this meant only opening the door. We are now confronted with the
      task of laying the foundations of socialist economy. Has this
      been done? No, it has not. We still lack the socialist
      foundation. Those Communists who imagine that we have it are
      greatly mistaken. The whole point is to distinguish firmly,
      clearly and dispassionately what constitutes the historic
      service rendered by the Russian revolution from what we do very
      badly, from what

      

      has not yet been created, and what we shall
      have to redo many times yet.

      Political events are always very confused and complicated. They
      can be compared with a chain. To hold the whole chain you must
      grasp the main link. Not a link chosen at random. What was the
      central event in 1917? Withdrawal from the war. The entire
      nation demanded this, and it overshadowed
      everything. Revolutionary Russia accomplished this withdrawal
      from the war. It cost tremendous effort; but the major demand of
      the people was satisfied, and that brought us victory for many
      years. The people realised, the peasants saw, every soldier
      returning from the front understood perfectly well that the
      Soviet government was a more democratic government, one that
      stood closer to the working people. No matter how many
      outrageous and absurd things we may have done in other spheres,
      the fact that we realised what the main task was proved that
      everything was right.

      What was the key feature of 1919 and 1920? Military
      resistance. The all-powerful Entente was marching against us,
      was at our throats. No propaganda was required there. Every
      non-Party peasant understood what was going on. The landowners
      were coming back. The Communists knew how to fight them. That is
      why, taken in the mass, the peasants followed the lead of the
      Communists; that is why we were victorious.

      In 1921, the key feature was an orderly retreat. This required
      stern discipline. The Workers’ Opposition said: “You
      are underrating the workers; the workers should display greater
      initiative.” But initiative had to be displayed then by
      retreating in good order and by maintaining strict
      discipline. Anyone who introduced an undertone of panic or
      insubordination would have doomed the revolution to defeat; for
      there is nothing more difficult than retreating with people who
      have been accustomed to victory, who are imbued with
      revolutionary views and ideals, and who, in their hearts, regard
      every retreat as a disgraceful matter. The greatest danger was
      the violation of good order, and the greatest task was to
      maintain good order.

      And what is the key feature now? The key feature now—and I
      would like to sum up my report with this—is not that  

      

      we
      have changed our line of policy. An incredible lot of nonsense
      is being talked about this in connection with NEP. It is all hot
      air, pernicious twaddle. In connection with NEP some people are
      beginning to fuss around, proposing to reorganise our government
      departments and to form new ones. All this is pernicious
      twaddle. In the present situation the key feature is people, the
      proper choice of people. A revolutionary who is accustomed to
      struggle against petty reformists and uplift educators finds it
      hard to understand this. Soberly weighed up, the political
      conclusion to be drawn from the present situation is that we
      have advanced so far that we cannot hold all the positions; and
      we need not hold them all.

      Internationally our position has improved vastly these last few
      years. The Soviet type of state is our achievement; it is a step
      forward in human progress; and the information the Communist
      International receives from every country every day corroborates
      this. Nobody has the slightest doubt about that. From the point
      of view of practical work, however, the position is that unless
      the Communists render the masses of the peasants practical
      assistance they will lose their support. Passing laws, passing
      better decrees, etc., is not now the main object of our
      attention. There was a time when the passing of decrees was a
      form of pro paganda. People used to laugh at us and say that the
      Bolsheviks do not realise that their decrees are not being
      carried out; the entire whiteguard press was full of jeers on
      that score. But at that period this passing of decrees was quite
      justified. We Bolsheviks had just taken power, and we said to
      the peasant, to the worker: “Here is a decree; this is how
      we would like to have the state administered. Try it!”
      From the very outset we gave the ordinary workers and peasants
      an idea of our policy in the form of decrees. The result was the
      enormous confidence we enjoyed and now enjoy among the masses of
      the people. This was an essential period at the beginning of the
      revolution; without it we should not have risen on the crest of
      the revolutionary wave; we should have wallowed in its
      trough. Without it we should not have won the confidence of all
      the workers and peasants who wanted to build their lives on new
      lines. But this period has passed,

      

      and we refuse to understand
      this. Now the peasants and workers will laugh at us if we order
      this or that government department to be formed or
      reorganised. The ordinary workers and peasants will display no
      interest in this now, and they will be right, because this is
      not the central task today. This is not the sort of thing with
      which we Communists should now go to the people. Although we who
      are engaged in government departments are always over whelmed
      with so many petty affairs, this is not the link that we must
      grasp, this is not the key feature. The key feature is that we
      have not got the right men in the right places; that responsible
      Communists who acquitted themselves magnificently during the
      revolution have been given commercial and industrial functions
      about which they know nothing; and they prevent us from seeing
      the truth, for rogues and rascals hide magnificently behind
      their backs. The trouble is that we have no such thing as
      practical control of how things have been done. This is a
      prosaic job, a small job; these are petty affairs. But after the
      greatest political change in history, bearing in mind that for a
      time we shall have to live in the midst of the capitalist
      system, the key feature now is not politics in the narrow sense
      of the word (what we read in the newspapers is just political
      fireworks; there is nothing socialist in it at all), the key
      feature is not resolutions, not departments and not
      reorganisation. As long as these things are necessary we shall
      do them, but don’t go to the people with them. Choose the
      proper men and introduce practical control. That is what the
      people will appreciate.

      In the sea of people we are after all but a drop in the ocean,
      and we can administer only when we express correctly what the
      people are conscious of. Unless we do this the Communist Party
      will not lead the proletariat, the proletariat will not lead the
      masses, and the whole machine will collapse. The chief thing the
      people, all the working people, want today is nothing but help
      in their desperate hunger and need; they want to be shown that
      the improvement needed by the peasants is really taking place in
      the form they are accustomed to. The peasant knows and is
      accustomed to the market and trade. We were unable to introduce
      direct communist distribution. We lacked the

      

      factories and
      their equipment for this. That being the case, we must provide
      the peasants with what they need through the medium of trade,
      and provide it as well as the capitalist did, otherwise the
      people will not tolerate such an administration. This is the key
      to the situation; and unless something unexpected arises, this,
      given three conditions, should be the central feature of our
      activities in 1922.

      The first condition is that there shall be no intervention. We
      are doing all we can in the diplomatic field to avoid it;
      nevertheless, it may occur any day. We must really be on the
      alert, and we must agree to make certain big sacrifices for the
      sake of the Red Army, within definite limits, of course. We are
      confronted by the entire bourgeois world, which is only seeking
      a way in which to strangle us. Our Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries are nothing more nor less than the
      agents of this bourgeoisie. Such is their political status.

      The second condition is that the financial crisis shall not be
      too severe. The crisis is approaching. You will hear about that
      when we discuss financial policy. If it is too severe and
      rigorous we shall have to revise many things again and
      concentrate all efforts on one thing. If it is not too severe it
      may even be useful; it will give the Communists in all the state
      trusts a good shaking; only we must not forget to do it. The
      financial crisis will shake up government departments and
      industrial enterprises, and those that are not equal to their
      task will be the first to burst; only we must take care that all
      the blame for this is not thrown on the specialists while the
      responsible Communists are praised for being very good fellows
      who have fought at the fronts and have always worked well. Thus,
      if the financial crisis is not too severe we can derive some
      benefit from it and comb the ranks of the responsible Communists
      engaged in the business departments not in the way the Central
      Control Commission and the Central Verification Commission[8] comb them, but very thoroughly.

      The third condition is that we shall make no political mistakes
      in this period. Of course, if we do make political mistakes all
      our work of economic construction will be disrupted and we shall
      land ourselves in controversies

      

      about how to rectify them and
      what direction to pursue. But if we make no sad mistakes, the
      key feature in the near future will be not decrees and politics
      in the narrow sense of the word, not departments and their
      organisation—the responsible Communists and the Soviet
      institutions will deal with these things whenever
      necessary—the main thing in all our activities will be
      choosing the right people and making sure that decisions are
      carried out. If, in this respect, we learn something practical,
      if we do something practically useful, we shall again overcome
      all difficulties.

      In conclusion I must mention the practical side of the question
      of our Soviet institutions, the higher government bodies and the
      Party’s relation to them. The relations between the Party
      and the Soviet government bodies are not what they ought to
      be. On this point we are quite unanimous. I have given one
      example of how minor matters are dragged before the Political
      Bureau. It is extremely difficult to get out of this by formal
      means, for there is only one governing party in our country; and
      a member of the Party cannot be prohibited from lodging
      complaints. That is why everything that comes up on the Council
      of People’s Commissars is dragged before the Political
      Bureau. I, too, am greatly to blame for this, for to a large
      extent contact between the Council of People’s Commissars
      and the Political Bureau was maintained through me. When I was
      obliged to retire from work it was found that the two wheels
      were not working in unison and Kamenev had to bear a treble load
      to maintain this contact. Inasmuch as it is barely probable that
      I shall return to work in the near future, all hope devolves on
      the fact that there are two other deputies—Comrade
      Tsyurupa, who has been cleansed by the Germans, and Comrade
      Rykov, whom they have splendidly cleansed. It seems that even
      Wilhelm, the German Emperor, has stood us in good stead—I
      never expected it. He had a surgeon, who happened to be the
      doctor treating Comrade Rykov, and he removed his worst part,
      keeping it in Germany, and left the best part intact, sending
      that part of Comrade Rykov thoroughly cleansed to us. If that
      method continues to be used it will be a really good thing.



      Joking aside, a word or two about the main instructions. On this
      point there is complete unanimity on the Central Committee, and
      I hope that the Congress will pay the closest attention to it
      and endorse the instructions that the Political Bureau and the
      Central Committee be relieved of minor matters, and that more
      should be shifted to the responsible officials. The
      People’s Commissars must be responsible for their work and
      should not bring these matters up first on the Council of
      Peeple’s Commissars and then on the Political
      Bureau. Formally, we cannot abolish the right to lodge
      complaints with the Central Committee, for our Party is the only
      governing party in the country. But we must put a stop to the
      habit of bringing every petty matter before the Central
      Committee; we must raise the prestige of the Council of
      People’s Commissars. The Commissars and not the Deputy
      Commissars must mainly attend the meetings of the Council. The
      functions of the Council must be changed in the direction in
      which I have not succeeded in changing them during the past
      year, that is, it must pay much more attention to executive
      control. We shall have two more deputies—Rykov and
      Tsyurupa. When Rykov was in the Extraordinary Authorised Council
      of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defence for the Supply of
      the Red Army and Navy he tightened things up and the work went
      well. Tsyurupa organised one of the most efficient
      People’s Commissariats. If together they make the maximum
      effort to improve the People ’s Commissariats in the sense
      of efficiency and responsibility, we shall make some, even if a
      little, progress here. We have eighteen People’s
      Commissariats of which not less than fifteen are of no use at
      all—efficient People’s Commissars cannot be found
      everywhere, and I certainly hope that people give this more of
      their attention. Comrade Rykov must be a member, of the Central
      Committee Bureau and of the Presidium of the All-Russia Central
      Executive Committee because there must be a tie-up between these
      two bodies, for without this tie-up the main wheels some times
      spin in the air.

      In this connection, we must see to it that the number of
      commissions of the Council of People’s Commissars and of
      the Council of Labour and Defence is reduced. These bodies 

      

      must
      know and settle their own affairs and not split up into an
      infinite number of commissions. A few days ago the commissions
      were overhauled. It was found that there were one hundred and
      twenty of them. How many were necessary? Sixteen. And this is
      not the first cut. Instead of accepting responsibility for their
      work, preparing a decision for the Council of People’s
      Commissars and knowing that they bear responsibility for this
      decision, there is a tendency to take shelter behind
      commissions. The devil himself would lose his way in this maze
      of commissions. Nobody knows what is going on, who is
      responsible; everything is mixed up, and finally a decision is
      passed for which everybody is held responsible.

      In this connection, reference must be made to the need for
      extending and developing the autonomy and activities of the
      regional economic conferences. The administrative division of
      Russia has now been drawn up on scientific lines; the economic
      and climatic conditions, the way of life, the conditions of
      obtaining fuel, of local industry, etc., have all been taken
      into account. On the basis of this division, district and
      regional economic conferences have been instituted. Changes may
      be made here and there, of course, but the prestige of these
      economic conferences must be enhanced.

      Then we rnust see to it that the All-Russia Central Executive
      Committee works more energetically, meets in session more
      regularly, and for longer periods. The sessions of the
      All-Russia Central Executive Committee should discuss bills
      which sometimes are hastily brought before the Council of
      People’s Commissars when there is no need to do so. It
      would be better to postpone such bills and give the local
      workers an opportunity to study them carefully. Stricter demands
      should be made upon those who draft the bills. This is not
      done.

      If the sessions of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee
      last longer, they can split up into sections and subcommissions,
      and thus will be able to verify the work more strictly and
      strive to achieve what in my opinion is the key, the
      quintessence of the present political situation: to concentrate
      attention on choosing the right people and on verifying how
      decisions are carried out.



      It must be admitted, and we must not be afraid to admit, that in
      ninety-nine cases out of a hundred the responsible Communists
      are not in the jobs they are now fit for; that they are unable
      to perform their duties, and that they must sit down to
      learn. If this is admitted, and since we have the opportunity to
      learn—judging by the general international situation we
      shall have time to do so—we must do it, come what
      may. (Stormy applause.)

      Closing Speech On The Political Report Of The Central Committee
      Of The R.C.P.(B.) March 28 



      (Applause. ) First of all I shall have to devote a
      little time to criticising the remarks made here by Comrades
      Preobrazhensky and Osinsky. I think that on the most important
      and fundamental question Comrades Preobrazhensky and Osinsky
      were wide of the mark, and their own statements have proved
      their line of policy to be wrong.

      Comrade Preobrazhensky spoke about capitalism and said that we
      ought to open a general discussion on our Programme. I think
      that this would be the most unproductive and unjustified waste
      of time.

      First of all about state capitalism.

      “State capitalism is capitalism,” said
      Preobrazhensky, “and that is the only way it can and
      should be interpreted.” I say that that is pure
      scholasticism. Up to now nobody could have written a book about
      this sort of capitalism, because this is the first time in human
      history that we see anything like it. All the more or less
      intelligible books about state capitalism that have appeared up
      to now were written under conditions and in a situation where
      state capitalism was capitalism. Now things are different; and
      neither Marx nor the Marxists could foresee this. We must not
      look to the past. When you write history, you will write it
      magnificently; but when you write a textbook, you will say:
      State capitalism is the most unexpected and absolutely
      unforeseen form of capitalism—for nobody could foresee
      that the proletariat would achieve power in one of the least
      developed countries, and would first try 

      

      to organise large-scale
      production and distribution for the peasantry and then, finding
      that it could not cope with the task owing to the low standard
      of culture, would enlist the services of capitalism. Nobody ever
      foresaw this; but it is an incontrovertible fact.

      Comrade Larin, in his speech, revealed that he has a very vague
      conception of the New Economic Policy and of how it should be
      handled.

      Not a single serious objection has been raised to our adoption
      of the New Economic Policy. The proletariat is not afraid to
      admit that certain things in the revolution went off
      magnificently, and that others went awry. All the revolutionary
      parties that have perished so far, perished because they became
      conceited, because they failed to see the source of their
      strength and feared to discuss their weaknesses. We, however,
      shall not perish, because we are not afraid to discuss our
      weaknesses and will learn to overcome them. (Applause.
      ) The capitalism that we have permitted is essential. If it is
      ugly and bad, we shall be able to rectify it, because power is
      in our hands and we have nothing to fear. Everybody admits this,
      and so it is ridiculous to confuse this with panic-mongering. If
      we were afraid to admit this our doom would be sealed. But the
      fact that we will learn and want to learn this is proved by the
      experience of the past three, four, five years, during which we
      learnt more complicated matters in a shorter period. True, then
      we were driven by necessity. During the war we were driven very
      hard; I think there was neither a front nor a campaign in which
      we were not hard pressed. The enemy came within a hundred versts
      of Moscow; was approaching Orel; was within five versts of
      Petrograd. That was the time we really woke up and began to
      learn and to put the lessons we had learnt into practice, and we
      drove out the enemy.

      The position now is that we have to deal with an enemy in
      mundane economics, and this is a thousand times more
      difficult. The controversies over state capitalism that have
      been raging in our literature up to now could at best be
      included in textbooks on history. I do not in the least deny
      that textbooks are useful, and recently I wrote that it would be
      far better if our authors devoted less attention

      

      to newspapers
      and political twaddle and wrote textbooks, as many of them,
      including Comrade Larin, could do splendidly. His talent would
      prove most useful on work of this kind and we would solve the
      problem that Comrade Trotsky emphasised so well when he said
      that the main task at the present time is to train the younger
      generation, but we have nothing to train them with. Indeed, from
      what can the younger generation learn the social sciences? From
      the old bourgeois junk. This is disgraceful! And this is at a
      time when we have hundreds of Marxist authors who could write
      textbooks on all social problems, but do not do so because their
      minds are taken up with other things. 

      As regards state capitalism, we ought to know what should be the
      slogan for agitation and propaganda, what must be explained,
      what we must get everyone to understand practically. And that is
      that the state capitalism that we have now is not the state
      capitalism that the Germans wrote about. It is capitalism that
      we ourselves have permitted. Is that true or not? Everybody
      knows that it is true!

      At a congress of Communists we passed a decision that state
      capitalism would be permitted by the proletarian state, and we
      are the state. If we did wrong we are to blame and it is no use
      shifting the blame to somebody else! We must learn, we must see
      to it that in a proletarian country state capitalism cannot and
      does not go beyond the framework and conditions delineated for
      it by the proletariat, beyond conditions that benefit the
      proletariat. It was quite rightly pointed out here that we had
      to give consideration to the peasants as a mass, and enable them
      to trade freely. Every intelligent worker appreciates that this
      is necessary for the proletarian dictatorship, and only Comrade
      Shlyapnikov can joke about and mock it. This is appreciated by
      everybody and has been chewed over a thousand times, but you
      simply refuse to understand it. If under present conditions the
      peasant must have freedom to trade within certain limits, we
      must give it to him, but this does not mean that we are
      permitting trade in raw brandy. We shall punish people for that
      sort of trade. It does not mean that we are permitting the sale
      of political literature called Menshevik and
      Socialist-Revolutionary and financed by the capitalists of the
      whole world.



      That is what I meant when I mentioned machine-guns, and Comrade
      Shlyapnikov should have understood it. What he says is
      nonsensical!

      You will not frighten anybody and you will not win any sympathy!
      (Applause. Laughter. )

      Poor Shlyapnikov! Lenin had planned to use machine-guns against
      him!

      What I had in mind was Party disciplinary measures, and not
      machine-guns as such. When we talk about machine-guns we have in
      mind the people in this country whom we call Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and who argue as follows: “You
      say you are retreating towards capitalism, and we say the same
      thing; we agree with you!” We are constantly hearing this
      sort of thing; and abroad a gigantic propaganda campaign is
      being conducted to prove that while we Bolsheviks are keeping
      the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries in prison, we
      ourselves are permitting capitalism. True, we are permitting
      capitalism, but within the limits that the peasants need. This
      is essential! Without it the peasants could not exist and
      continue with their husbandry. But we maintain that the Russian
      peasants can do very well without Socialist-Revolutionary and
      Menshevik propaganda. To those who assert the contrary we say:
      We would rather perish to the last man than yield to you! And
      our courts must understand all this. Now that we are passing
      from the Cheka to state-political courts we must say at this
      Congress that there is no such thing as above-class courts. Our
      courts must be elected, proletarian courts; and they must know
      what it is that we are permitting. They must clearly understand
      what state capitalism is.

      This is the political slogan of the day and not a controversy
      about what the German professors meant by state capitalism and
      what we mean by it. We have gone through a great deal since
      then, and it is altogether unseemly for us to look back.

      The degree to which Comrade Preobrazhensky goes off the
      political track is shown by what he said about an Economic
      Bureau and about the Programme.[9] What a magnificent
      thing our Programme is, but how frightfully we garble it! How is
      that possible? Because some people read

      

      it word for word and
      line by line, and beyond that they will not look. They pick out
      a passage and say: “There was a controversy over
      this.” Some say that the line of the Workers’
      Faculties and of the Communist local cells was correct, but the
      line of those who said: “Go easy, treat those specialists
      more carefully”, was wrong. True, the Communist cells are
      splendid and so are the Workers’ Faculties, but they are
      not infallible; they are not saints. . . .

      Yes, the Communist cells are the representatives of our Party,
      and the Workers’ Faculties are the representatives of our
      class; but the fact that they make mistakes and that we must
      correct them is an elementary truism. How they are to be
      corrected I do not know, because I did not attend the meetings
      of the Central Committee at which this question was
      discussed. But I do know that the Workers’ Faculties and
      the Communist cells overdo things in the line they have taken
      against the professors. After our Central Committee has examined
      this question in all its aspects and has decided that things
      have been overdone and that a more cautious line must be adopted
      towards these professors, who are the representatives of an
      alien class, Comrade Preobrazhensky comes along, takes out the
      Programme and says: “No political concessions to this
      stratum; that would be an infringement of the
      Programme.”

      If we start guiding the Party in this way we shall inevitably go
      under. And this is not because Comrade Preobrazhensky has wrong
      ideas about politics in general, a but because he approaches
      everything from the angle of what is his strongest point; he is
      a theoretician whose mind is restricted by what is customary and
      usual; he is a propagandist whose mind is taken up with measures
      directed to the purpose of propaganda. Everybody is aware of and
      appreciates this strong point of his, but when he approaches
      things from the political and administrative angle the result is
      simply monstrous. Set up an Economic Bureau?! But everybody has
      just said, everybody has agreed, and we have complete unanimity
      on the point (and this is very important, for action depends
      upon this unity) that the Party machinery must be separated from
      the Soviet government machinery.



      It is terribly difficult to do this; we lack the men! But
      Preobrazhensky comes along and airily says that Stalin has jobs
      in two Commissariats.[10] Who among us has not sinned in this
      way? Who has not undertaken several duties at once? And how can
      we do otherwise? What can we do to preserve the present
      situation in the People’s Commissariat of Nationalities;
      to handle all the Turkestan, Caucasian, and other questions?
      These are all political questions! They have to be
      settled. These are questions that have engaged the attention of
      European states for hundreds of years, and only an infinitesimal
      number of them have been settled in democratic republics. We are
      settling them; and we need a man to whom the representatives of
      any of these nations can go and discuss their difficulties in
      all detail. Where can we find such a man? I don’t think
      Comrade Preobrazhensky could suggest any better candidate than
      Comrade Stalin. 

      The same thing applies to the Workers’ and Peasants’
      Inspection. This is a vast business; but to be able to handle
      investigations we must have at the head of it a man who enjoys
      high prestige, otherwise we shall become submerged in and
      overwhelmed by petty intrigue.

      Comrade Preobrazhensky proposes that an Economic Bureau should
      be set up; but if we do that all our talk about separating Party
      activities from Soviet government activities will be just hot
      air. Comrade Preobrazhensky proposes what appears to be a
      splendid scheme: on the one hand the Political Bureau, then the
      Economic Bureau, and then the Organising Bureau. But all this is
      very fine only on paper; in actual practice it is ridiculous! I
      positively cannot understand how, after Soviet power has been in
      existence for five years, a man who has an intuition for vital
      politics can make and insist upon such a proposal.

      What is the difference between the Organising Bureau and the
      Political Bureau? You cannot draw a hard and fast line between a
      political question and an organisation question. Any political
      question may be an organisation question, and vice versa. Only
      after established practice had shown that questions could be
      transferred from the Organising Bureau to the Political Bureau
      was it possible to organise the work of the Central Committee
      properly. 



      Has anybody ever proposed anything different? No, because no
      other rational solution can be proposed. Political questions
      cannot be mechanically separated from organisation
      questions. Politics are conducted by definite people; but if
      other people are going to draft documents, nothing will come of
      it.

      You know perfectly well that there have been revolutions in
      which parliamentary assemblies drafted documents which were put
      into effect by people from another class. This led to friction,
      and they were kicked out. Organisation questions cannot be
      separated from politics. Politics are concentrated
      economics.

      Comrade Kosior complained about the Central Committee and
      mentioned names (I have written them all down). I am not
      personally familiar with the subject, and so I can not answer;
      but if you, as the Party Congress, are interested, it is your
      duty to elect a commission to investigate every case and subject
      Kosior and the persons concerned to examination by third
      degree. The whole point here is that if the Central Committee is
      deprived of the right to distribute forces, it will be unable to
      direct policy. Although we make mistakes when we transfer people
      from one place to another, nevertheless, I take the liberty of
      asserting that all the time it has been functioning, the
      Political Bureau of the Central Committee has made the minimum
      of mistakes. This is not self-praise. The activities of the
      Political Bureau are tested not by commissions, not by people
      appointed by our Party, but by the whiteguards, by our enemies;
      and the proof is the results of its policy, in which no serious
      mistakes have been committed.

      Comrade Osinsky’s strong point is that if he undertakes
      anything he pursues it with energy and vigour. We must do all we
      can to cultivate this strong point of his and to curb his weak
      points (even if Osinsky raises a howl—he is such a
      vigorous fellow—this must be done; otherwise, as a worker,
      he will be done for). We on the Central Committee have taken
      measures which, I think, will combine his weak points with his
      strong ones.

      If I wanted to polemise with Comrade Osinsky—which I do
      not want to do—I would say that the weightiest evidence
      that could be brought against him is the speech he

      

      delivered
      here today. I would have it printed and posted up on a
      board. . . . There was once a man. . . .

      A Deputy People’s Commissar and a leading figure in one of
      the most important People’s Commissariats, and foremost
      among those who can draw up a platform on any question, this man
      proposes that we should adopt the Cabinet system.[11] I
      assert that this man is absolutely done for. . . . I will not go
      into this in detail, or polemise; what interests me most is that
      Comrade Osinsky’s vast energy should be directed into
      proper channels. If Comrade Osinsky does not, in a comradely
      way, heed the advice that has been often given to him by the
      Central Committee, and for which I have been largely
      responsible, and if he does not moderate his zeal in this
      matter, he will inevitably find himself in the mire, as he found
      himself today.

      This is very unpleasant for a man who is fond of displaying his
      character; and it is quite legitimate for a man gifted with a
      strong character to want to display it. Would to God that
      everybody had such a character to display. But the Central
      Committee must see to it that this character is displayed for a
      useful purpose. The Central Committee must see to it that this
      talk about a Cabinet is cut short, even if the man who undergoes
      this circumcision, so to speak, complains about it. This will be
      beneficial. He must put a curb on his talents to prevent himself
      from landing in the mire; and he must consult comrades in the
      other People’s Commissariats and adhere to the general
      line. Has any one of our Commissariats done anything without
      controversy? No.

      “Improvement of the system of administration and the
      psychological mobilisation of the masses.” This is sheer
      murder! If the Congress were to adopt this politically
      reactionary point of view it would be the surest and best method
      of committing suicide.

      “Improvement of the system of administration”?! Pray
      God that we succeed, at least, in getting out of the muddle that
      we are in today.

      We have no system?! For five years we have been spending our
      best efforts in the endeavour to create this system! This system
      is a tremendous step forward.

      The machinery of state is faulty! Do we know what the

      

      trouble
      is? We do not! But Comrade Osinsky talks as if he does. Why, he
      can sit down and in ten minutes devise a whole system of
      administration. It will be harmful and a political mistake if
      his zeal is not curbed. In other channels, however, the zeal he
      is displaying now will be very useful.

      Well, that’s one illustration. And then Comrades
      Preobrazhensky and Osinsky bore out in their comments what I
      said about the most important thing, and Comrade Larin proved it
      still more thoroughly. Look what he did. He hurled accusations
      at me and laughed and jested very merrily.

      He does this magnificently; this is his strong point. If Comrade
      Larin could display this strong point of his in some field other
      than that of state activities he would be a thousand times more
      useful for our Republic; for he is a very capable man and has a
      vivid imagination. This quality is extremely valuable; it is
      wrong to think that only poets need imagination. That is a silly
      prejudice! It is needed even in mathematics; it would have been
      impossible to discover the differential and integral calculus
      without imagination. Imagination is a very valuable asset; but
      Comrade Larin has a little too much of it. I would say, for
      example, that if Comrade Larin’s stock of imagination were
      divided equally among all the members of the R.C.P., there would
      be very good results. (Laughter. Applause. ) But until
      we can perform this operation, Comrade Larin must be kept away
      from state, administrative, planning, and economic
      affairs. Otherwise, we shall have the same thing occurring as
      did in the old Supreme Economic Council, when Comrade Rykov had
      not yet recovered, and affairs were directed and documents
      signed by “Y. Larin” on behalf of the entire Supreme
      Economic Council. Things were run badly not because Comrade
      Larin displayed his worst qualities, but on the contrary; it was
      because he displayed his best qualities—and nobody can
      have even a shadow of doubt about his devotion and knowledge of
      affairs. Nevertheless, things were run badly.

      This is exactly what I said. True, all these are copybook
      maxims. As for copybook maxims, even Kamkov poked fun at me for
      this at the Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionaries.

      

      He said:
      “Today, Lenin is preaching:
      ’Thou shalt not steal’; and tomorrow he will add:
      ’Thou shalt not commit adultery.’ This is all that
      Lenin’s wisdom amounts to.” I heard this from
      Kamkov, the Socialist-Revolutionary, as far back as 1918. And if
      Kamkov, who backed these arguments with artillery, made no
      impression on anyone, what impression can Comrade Larin’s
      jokes make? Now we must concentrate all our attention on the
      major problems of our New Economic Policy. Here Comrade Larin
      tried to divert the Party on to the wrong road. If he were
      engaged with matters on which he could usefully display his
      numerous talents, where he could be of great benefit to the
      younger generation, and where he would not play such a trick as
      he played in the State Planning Commission, it would be entirely
      different. If he were engaged in such work he would make an
      impression on the younger generation—I think I am speaking
      plainly enough—and we should not have the confusion that
      he has caused here.[12]

      I said that Comrade Kamenev proposed on the Political Bureau
      that a resolution be adopted to the effect that it would be
      useful to import food and that canned goods be purchased with
      Soviet currency. Larin sat here, heard this perfectly well, and
      remembering it perfectly well, said as soon as he got on to the
      platform: “Lenin forgot, owing to ill health—we
      shall forgive him this time—that the permission of the
      Political Bureau has to be obtained for disbursements from the
      gold reserve.” Had Comrade Kamenev proposed that we should
      take money out of the gold reserve and give it to French
      profiteers in exchange for canned goods we would not have
      listened to him. We did not offer a single gold kopek for the
      canned goods, we offered Soviet paper cumncy and—just
      imagine—it was accepted. Wolfson even assured me yesterday
      that these canned goods were of good quality (although they have
      not arrived yet); but I shall not believe him until we have
      tasted them, because here they may try to cheat us. The point
      is, however, that Comrade Larin garbled the facts; we did not
      spend a single gold kopek; we spent 160,000 million Soviet paper
      rubles.

      Of course, it would be ridiculous and absurd to think that
      Comrade Larin did this with malicious intent. No,

      

      that is not
      the point. The point is that his imagination soars a trillion
      kilometres high and, as a consequence, he mixes everything
      up.

      Then he went on to say that the State Planning Commission had
      proposed to lease out three-fourths of our railways. It is a
      good thing that he said this at the Party Congress, where
      Krzhizhanovsky immediately refuted him. It does not often happen
      like that. You think that talk of this sort is heard only at
      Party congresses? Inquire at the Central Control Commission and
      they will tell you how they examined the case of the Moscow
      Debating Club,[13] and what brought up the case of the
      Moscow Debating Club, where Comrades Larin and
      Ryazanov. . . . (Ryazanov from his seat : “I said
      nothing about the gold reserve there; worse things were
      said.”) I was not in Moscow and took no part in the
      investigation of this case, I merely had a brief
      report. . . . (Ryazanov : “Don’t believe
      every rumour.”) I learned this from a conversation I had
      with Comrade Solts; it is not a rumour, but a conversation I had
      with a man whom our supreme body, the Party Congress, had
      appointed to the Central Control Commission. It was he who told
      me; and what he told me cannot rouse the slightest doubt. One
      must be very thoughtless to call this a rumour. The Central
      Control Commission investigated the affair of the Debating Club
      and was obliged to state unanimously that it was not being run
      properly. What is wrong is quite clear to me. Today, Larin, in
      passing, carried away by his own eloquence, went to the length
      of saying that a proposal had been made to lease out
      three-fourths of our railways, but that the Central Committee
      had put the matter right. Krzhizhanovsky said that nothing of
      the kind had happened; the Central Committee had put nothing
      right; Larin had simply muddled up his facts. This is constantly
      happening.

      For four years we have been unable to put a useful worker like
      Larin to really useful work and to relieve him of work where he
      causes harm, in spite of himself.

      The situation is rather unnatural, I think. We have the
      dictatorship of the proletariat, a reign of terror, victory over
      all the armies in the world, but no victory over Larin’s
      army! Here we have suffered utter defeat! He is always 

      

      doing
      what he has no business to do. His vast knowledge and his
      ability to enthuse people would be of real benefit to the
      younger generation, which is groping in the dark. We are unable
      to utilise his knowledge, and this gives rise to friction and
      resistance. Here the Political Bureau, the Organising Bureau of
      the Central Committee and the Plenary Meetings of the Central
      Committee, which are accused of enjoying too much authority,
      turn out to have insufficient authority, or prestige, to
      distribute all the comrades properly.

      We must think this question over and discuss it seriously. This
      is the pivot of our work, and we must set things right here. If
      we do, we shall emerge from our difficulties. We shall achieve
      this by rectifying things, but not by talking about the new
      tasks of the Agrarian Programme as Osinsky and Larin did. I
      wrote a review of this programme for the Central Committee.[14] I shall not discuss it now; every
      member of the Party interested in the subject has a right to go
      to the Secretariat and read it there. Please do so. If we divert
      the efforts of Larin and Osinsky into the proper channels and
      curb their misguided zeal, enormous benefit will accrue.

      In conclusion I shall say a few words about Shlyapnikov. I
      intended to speak about him at greater length, but ninety nine
      per cent of this subject has been covered by Trotsky and
      Zinoviev, who on instructions of the Central Committee replied
      to the Statement of the Twenty-Two[15] at the meeting of
      the Communist International.

      Firstly, Comrade Shlyapnikov pretended not to understand why I
      referred to machine-guns and panic-mongers; and he jokingly said
      that he had been tried lots of times. Of course, comrades, it is
      not a bad thing to make a joke. One cannot speak at a big
      meeting without cracking a joke or two, because one’s
      audience gets weary. One must be human. But there are certain
      things that one must not joke about; there is such a thing as
      Party unity.

      At a time when we are completely surrounded by enemies; when the
      international bourgeoisie is sufficiently astute to shift
      Milyukov to the left, to supply the Socialist-Revolutionaries
      with money for the publication of all sorts of newspapers and to
      incite Vandervelde and Otto 

      

      Bauer to launch a campaign against
      the trial of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and to howl that the
      Bolsheviks are brutes; when all these people, who have studied
      politics for ages and have thousands of millions of gold rubles,
      francs, etc., at their disposal, are arrayed against us, for
      Comrade Shlyapnikov to crack jokes and to say: “I have
      been tried by the Central Committee”, and so forth, is a
      deplorable thing, comrades. The Party Congress must draw
      definite conclusions. We do not arrange trials at the Central
      Committee for nothing! Comrade Shlyapnikov was tried by the
      Central Committee, and we were short of three votes to expel him
      from the Party.[16] The members of the Party gathered
      at this Congress should interest themselves in the matter and
      read the minutes of that meeting of the Central Committee. This
      is no laughing matter!

      You have a legitimate right to appeal to the Communist
      International. But a long time before that appeal was lodged a
      large majority of the Central Committee was in favour of
      expelling Comrade Shlyapnikov; only the necessary two-third vote
      was lacking. You cannot trifle with a thing like that! It will
      do you no harm to know that at the meeting of the Communist
      group at the Metalworkers’ Congress Comrade Shlyapnikov
      openly advocated a split.

      Comrade Trotsky has already dealt with the significance of
      Comrade Kollontai’s pamphlet.

      If we trifle with things like this it will be utterly hopeless
      to expect that we shall hold on in the difficult situation in
      which we now find ourselves. I have indicated the three
      conditions under which it will be possible for us to hold on:
      first, that there shall be no intervention; second, that the
      financial crisis shall not be too severe; and third, that we
      shall make no political mistakes.

      One of the speakers stated that I said political
      complications. No, I said political mistakes. If we make no
      political mistakes, I say, 99 per cent of the Party membership
      will be with us, and so also will the non-Party workers and
      peasants, who will understand that this is the time to
      learn.

      I remember that in the article he wrote on the anniversary of
      the Red Army Comrade Trotsky said: “A year of
      tuition.” This slogan applies equally to the Party and to
      the working

      

      class. During this period we have rallied around us
      a vast number of heroic people who have undoubtedly made the
      turn in world history permanent. But this does not justify our
      failure to understand that we now have ahead of us a “year
      of tuition”.

      We are standing much more firmly on our feet today than we stood
      a year ago. Of course, even today the bourgeoisie may attempt
      another armed intervention, but they will find it much more
      difficult than before; it is much more difficult today than it
      was yesterday.

      To ensure ourselves the opportunity to learn we must make no
      political mistakes. We must waste no time playing with the unity
      of the Party, as Comrade Shlyapnikov is doing. We cannot afford
      games of that kind! We know that the conflict within the Party
      is costing us a great deal. Comrades, we must not forget this
      lesson! Concerning the past year, the Central Committee has
      every right to say that at the opening of this Congress there
      was less factional strife in the Party, it was more united than
      last year. I do not want to boast that all factionalism in the
      Party has vanished. But it is an incontrovertible fact that
      there is less factionalism in the Party today. This has been
      proved.

      You know that the present Workers’ Opposition is only a
      wreck of the former Workers’ Opposition. Compare the
      signatures appended to the Statement of the Twenty-Two with
      those appended to the platform that was issued before the Tenth
      Congress. You will find that many of those signatures are
      missing. We must tell those people who legitimately used their
      right to appeal to the Communist International that they had no
      right to appeal on behalf of Myasnikov. The Myasnikov case came
      up last summer,[17] I was not in Moscow at the time,
      but I wrote Myasnikov a long letter,[18] which he inserted
      in his pamphlet. I saw that he was a capable man and that it was
      worth while having a talk with him; but this man must be told
      that if he comes out with criticism of this sort it will not be
      tolerated.

      He writes a letter saying: “Collect all the discontented
      in the district.” Yes, it is not a very difficult matter
      to collect all the discontented in a district. Take the speeches
      that Shlyapnikov delivers here, and which Comrade Medvedyev

      

      delivers elsewhere. (Medvedyev from his seat :
      “Where did you obtain your information?”) I obtained
      my information from the bodies appointed by the Congress of the
      R.C.P.: the Organising Bureau of the Central Committee, the
      Secretariat of the Central Committee, and the Central Control
      Commission. Make inquiries there, if you like, and you will
      learn what sort of speeches Comrade Medvedyev delivers. If we do
      not put a stop to this sort of thing we shall be unable to
      maintain unity which, perhaps, is our greatest asset. We must
      ruthlessly expose our mistakes and discuss them. If we clearly
      understand this—and we are beginning to understand it at
      this Congress—there is not the slightest doubt that we
      shall be able to overcome them. (Stormy applause. )

      Speech In Closing The Congress April 2 



      Comrades, we have reached the end of our Congress.

      The first difference that strikes one in comparing this Congress
      with the preceding one is the greater solidarity, the greater
      unanimity and greater organisational unity that have been
      displayed.

      Only a small part of one of the sections of the opposition that
      existed at the last Congress has placed itself outside the
      Party.

      On the trade union question and on the New Economic Policy no
      disagreements, or hardly any disagreements, have been revealed
      in our Party.

      The radically and fundamentally “new” achievement of
      this Congress is that it has provided vivid proof that our
      enemies are wrong in constantly reiterating that our Party is
      becoming senile and is losing its flexibility of mind and
      body.

      No. We have not lost this flexibility.

      When the objective state of affairs in Russia, and all over the
      world, called for an advance, for a supremely bold, swift and
      determined onslaught on the enemy, we made that onslaught. If
      necessary, we shall do it again and again.

      By that we raised our revolution to a height hitherto
      unparalleled in the world. No power on earth, no matter how much
      evil, hardship and suffering it may yet cause millions and
      hundreds of millions of people, can annul the major gains of our
      revolution, for these are no longer our but historic gains.

      But when in the spring of 1921 it turned out that the vanguard
      of the revolution was in danger of becoming

      

      isolated from the masses of the people, from the masses of the
      peasants, whom it must skilfully lead forward, we unanimously
      and firmly decided to retreat. And on the whole, during the past
      year we retreated in good revolutionary order.

      The proletarian revolutions maturing in all advanced countries
      of the world will be unable to solve their problems unless they
      combine the ability to fight heroically and to attack with the
      ability to retreat in good revolutionary order. The experience
      of the second period of our struggle, i.e., the experience of
      retreat, will in the future probably be just as useful to the
      workers of at least some countries, as the experience of the
      first period of our revolution, i.e., the experience of bold
      attack, will undoubtedly prove useful to the workers of all
      countries.

      Now we have decided to halt the retreat.

      This means that the entire object of our policy must be
      formulated in a new way.

      The central feature of the situation now is that the vanguard
      must not shirk the work of educating itself, of remoulding
      itself, must not be afraid of frankly admitting that it is not
      sufficiently trained and lacks the necessary skill. The main
      thing now is to advance as an immeasurably wider and larger
      mass, and only together with the peasantry, proving to them by
      deeds, in practice, by experience, that we are learning, and
      that we shall learn to assist them, to lead them forward. In the
      present international situation, in the present state of the
      productive forces of Russia, this problem can be solved only
      very slowly, cautiously, in a business-like way, and by testing
      a thousand times in a practical way every step that is
      taken.

      If voices are raised in our Party against this extremely slow
      and extremely cautious progress, these voices will be isolated
      ones.

      The Party as a whole has understood—and will now prove by
      deeds that it has understood—that at the present time its
      work must be organised exactly along these lines, and since we
      have understood it, we shall achieve our goal.

      I declare the Eleventh Congress of the Russian Communist Party
      closed. 
Endnotes

[1] The Eleventh
      Congress of the R.C.P.(B.) was held in Moscow on March
      27-April 2, 1922. 
    

      It was convened a year after the Civil War
      ended and the country went over to peaceful economic
      devolopment. Its purpose was to sum up the results of the first
      year of the New Economic Policy and map out the further plan of
      socialist construction. 
    

      This was the last Party Congress in
      which Lenin participated. It was attended by 522 delegates with
      a casting vote and 165 delegates with a consultative voice. It
      discussed 1) the political report of the Central Committee, 2)
      the organisation report of the Central Committee, 3) the report
      of the Auditing Commission, 5) the report of thc Central Control
      Commission, 5) the report of the Communist International, 6) the
      trade unions, 7) the Red Army, 8) the financial policy, 9) the
      results of the Party purge and the accompanying strengthening of
      the Party ranks, and the co-reports on work with young people
      and on the press and propaganda, and 10) elections to the
      Central Committee and the Central Control Commission. 
    

      Lenin
      opened the Congress, delivered the political report of the
      R.C.P.(B.), a closing speech on the report and a speech closing
      the Congress.  

[2] Here Lenin refers
      to Matyas Rakosi’s article “The New Economic Policy
      in Soviet Russia, which analyses Otto Bauer’s pamphlet
      “Der neue Kurs” in Sowjetrussland
      (“The New Policy” in Soviet Russia), published in
      Vienna in 1921. Rakosi’s article appeared in March 22 in
      the magazine Communist International,
      No. 20. Communist International, organ of the Executive
      Committee of the Communist International, was published in
      Russian, German, French, English, Spanish and Chinese. The first
      issue was put out on May 1, 1919. Publication was stopped in
      June 1943 following the decision of the Presidium of the
      Comintern Exccutive Committee of May 15, 1943 to dissolve the
      Conmunist International. 

[3] Lenin has in mind
      the struggle waged abroad between the Bolsheviks and the
      Mensheviks.  

[4] The Commission for
      Mixed Companies under the Council of Labour and Defence. This
      Commission was set up by a decision of the  Council of Labour
      and Defence on February 15, 1922. Its Chairman was Sokolnikov.
      

[5] The Northern
      Timber Trust was a special administrative body of the
      timber industry of the North White Sea area. It was established
      in 1921.  

[6]
Persuader-in-Chief was the nickname given by the
      soldiers to A. F. Kerensky, then the War and Navy Minister of
      the Provisional Government, for trying to persuade the soldiers
      to start an offensive when he toured the front in the summer of
      1917. This attempt was made on orders from the Anglo-French
      imperialists and the Russian bourgeoisie.  

[7] Alexander
      Todorsky’s book A Year With a Rifle and a Plough
      was published in 1918 by the Vesyegonsk Uyezd Executive
      Committee of Soviets, Tver Gubernia. Lenin speaks of this book
      in his article “A Little Picture in Illustration of Big
      Problems” (see present edition, Vol. 28, pp. 386-89).
      

[8] The Central
      Verification Commission was set up on June 25, 1921 by the
      C.C., R.C.P.(B.) to direct the work of local verification
      commissions during the period of the Party purge. It consisted
      of five men.  

[9] At the Congress
      E. A. Preobrazhensky suggested that another organ of the Central
      Committee, an Economic Bureau, should be set up in addition to
      the Political Bureau and the Organising Bureau. He accused the
      Central Committee of violating that part of the Party Programme
      dealing with bourgeois specialists, which stated that while
      creating a comradely atmosphere for the work of these people and
      showing concern for their material welfare no political
      concessions should be made to them and their
      counter-revolutionary impulses should be curbed. He alleged that
      the C.C. had made a political concession to the professors who
      had taken part in the strikes at institutions of higher learning
      in Moscow, Kazan, Petrograd and other cities in 1921-22. One of
      their basic demands was that the new Rules of Institutions of
      Higher Learning, drawn up by the Central Administration of
      Vocational and Political Schools and Institutions of Higher
      Learning and endorsed in the autumn of 1921 by the Council of
      People’s Commissars, should be revised. They objected to
      the Workers Faculties at institutions of higher learning and to
      the procedure, laid down in the new Rules, of forming the boards
      of these institutions with the participation of representatives
      of the students, trade unions and the Central Administration of
      Vocational and Political Schools and Institutions of Higher
      Learning. They demanded that the latter right be transferred to
      the teachers’ boards, and also made a number of economic
      demands. The Central Administration of Vocational and Political
      Schools and Institutions of Higher Learning, which was at that
      time  headed by Preobrazhensky, made the mistake of insisting on
      stern measures, including detention, against the striking
      instructors. The same stand was taken by the Communist cells and
      Workers’ Faculties of some institutions of higher
      learning. The Political Bureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) took this
      question up several times. In view of the need for a flexible
      approach to specialists, it rectified the mistake of the Central
      Administration of Vocational and Political Schools and
      Institutions of Higher Learning, instructing A. V. Lunacharsky,
      M. N. Pokrovsky and other leading officials of the
      People’s Commissariat of Public Education to examine the
      teachers’ demands and, without making any fundamental,
      political concessions, to reach agreement with them. In February
      1922 the Political Bureau set up a commission consisting of
      representatives of the People’s Commissariat of Public
      Education, the Central Committee of the Trade Union of Public
      Education Workers and teachers to examine the economic position
      of institutions of higher learning and recognise the need or new
      Rules of Institutions of Higher Learning. After repeated
      conferences between the teachers and the commission, and a
      number of other measures that were taken by the People’s
      Commissariat of Public Education on instructions from the Party
      C.C., the strikes were stopped.  

[10] J. V. Stalin was
      People’s Commissar of Nationalities from the time the
      People’s Commissariat of Nationalities was set up on
      October 26 (November 8), 1917 to its dissolution in July
      1923. As from March 1919, he was also People’s Commissar
      of State Control, and after the reorganisation of this
      Commissariat in February 1920, he was People’s Commissar
      of Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection until April 25,
      1922.  

[11] N. Osinsky
      (V. V. Obolensky), speaking at the Congress, proposed that a
      “Cabinet” of Commissars be set up. His suggestion
      was that it should be formed not by the All-Russia Central
      Executive Cornmittee but unilaterally by its Chairman, who would
      be responsible to A.R.C.E.C. While Osinsky spoke Lenin made the
      following entry in his note book: “(Set up a cabinet!
      ) one member should form the Cabinet” (Lenin
      Miscellany XIII, 1930, p. 22).  

[12] At the Congress
      Y. Larin alleged that an authorised body of the State Planning
      Commission had proposed that at the Genoa Conference the Soviet
      delegation should offer to lease (as a concession)
      three-quarters of the country’s railways, the
      Petrograd-Rybinsk waterway, the iron and steel plants in the
      Urals with a railway network of 3,000 versts, and the power
      engineering industry. This allegation was refuted by
      G. M. Krzhizhanovsky.  

[14] The Debating
      Club at the Moscow Committee of the R.C.P.(B.) was
      organised in August 1921. Similar clubs were opened in various
      parts of Moscow. They debated Party and Soviet development, the
      Soviet Republic’s economic policy and other
      problems. However, the Debating Club soon began to be used by
      opposition groups as a forum for propagandising their views. On
      February 20,1922, the Central Committee of the R.C.P.(B.)
      examined the question of the Debating Club on the basis of a
      report from the Central Control Commission and instructed the
      Moscow Committee to reconsider the composition of the
      Club’s board and to organise its work in conformity with
      the Party’s tasks.  

[14] See present
      volume, To Comrade Molotov For The Members Of
      The Political Bureau
.   

[15] This anti-Party
      statement was sent on February 26, 1922 to the Presidium of the
      Extended Plenary Meeting of the Comintern Executive Committee by
      a group of members of the former Workers’ Opposition
      (A. G. Shlyapnikov, S. P. Medvedyev, A. M. Kollontai,
      G. I. Myasnikov and others, which continued to exist as a
      faction despite the resolution “On Party Unity”
      passed by the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.). The statement
      claimed that “matters were unsatisfactory with regard to a
      united front in our country”, that the leading Party
      bodies were ignoring the requirements and interests of the
      workers and that a split was impending in the Party. The
      Comintern Executive Committee appointed a commission consisting
      of Clara Zetkin, Marcel Cachin, Jacob Friis, Vasil Kolarov, Karl
      Krejbich, Umberto Terracini and Arthur McManus to look into the
      Statement of the Twenty-Two. On March 4, on the basis of the
      report of this commission, a Plenary Meeting of the Comintern
      Executive Committee, with four abstentions, passed a resolution
      rejecting the accusations in the statement and censured the
      stand of the twenty-two as running counter to the decisions of
      the Tenth Congress of the R.C.P.(B.). The Eleventh Congress of
      the R.C.P.(B.) appointed a commission of 19 persons to examine
      the Statement of the Twenty Two. On April 2, on the basis of the
      report of this commission, a closed session of the Congress
      adopted a special resolution “On Certain Members of the
      Former Workers’ Opposition”, in which it stigmatised
      the anti-Party behaviour of members of the Workers’
      Opposition group, and warned the leaders of the group that they
      would be expelled from the Party if they renewed their factional
      activity.  

[16] On a motion
      proposed by Lenin, the joint sitting of the Plenary Meeting of
      the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission on
      August 9, 1921, exmined the question of expelling A. Shlyapnikov
      from the Central Committee and from the Party for anti-Party
      activity.  

[17] In Motovilikha
      District, Perm Gubernia, G. I. Myasnikov organised an anti-Party
      group which opposed the Party’s policy. On July 29, 1921,
      the Organising Bureau of the C.C., R.C.P.(B.) examined
      Myasnikov’s statements in the Perm organisation, found
      that they were directed against the Party and set up a
      commission to investigate Myasnikov’s activities. On
      August 22, acting on the basis of the report of this commission,
      the Organising Bureau found Myasnikov’s theses
      incompatible with Party interests, prohibited him from speaking
      of his theses at official Party meetings, recalled him from the
      Perm organisation and placed him at the disposal of the Central
      Committee. Myasnikov disobeyed the Central Committee, returned
      to Motovilikha and continued his anti-Party activities. At the
      same time, he tried to organise an anti-Party group in
      Petrograd. After investigating his activities, the C.C.,
      R.C.P.(B.) commission proposed that he should be expelled from
      tho Party for repeated violations of Party discipline and for
      organising a special anti-Party group in defiance of the Tenth
      Party Congress decision on Party unity. On February 20, 1922,
      the Political Bureau approved the commission’s decision on
      Myasnikov’s expulsion from the Party, with the provision
      that he should have the right to apply for Party membership in a
      year (see Eleventh Congress of the R.C.P.(B.). Verbatim
      Report, Moscow, 1961, pp. 748-49).

Letter to L. B. Kamenev
for Members of the Politbureau[1]
26.IX.

Comrade Kamenev, Stalin has probably already sent you the
resolution of his commission on the entry of the independent republics into
the R.S.F.S.R.  

If he has not, please take it from the secretary at once, and read
it. I spoke about it with Sokolnikov yesterday, and with Stalin
today. Tomorrow I shall see Mdivani (the Georgian Communist suspected of
“independent” sentiments).  

In my opinion the matter is of utmost importance. Stalin tends to be
somewhat hasty. Give the matter good thought (you once intended to deal
with it, and even had a bit to do with it); Zinoviev too.  

Stalin has already consented to make one concession:

in Clause 1, instead of “entry” into the R.S.F.S.R., to put:



   "Formal unification with the R.S.F.S.R. in a Union of Soviet
   Republics of Europe and Asia."  



I hope the purport of this concession is clear: we consider ourselves,
the Ukrainian S.S.R. and others, equal, and enter with them, on an equal
basis, into a new union, a new

    

federation, the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia.


Clause 2 needs to be amended as well. What is needed besides the
sessions of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of the R.S.F.S.R. is
a 

“Federal All-Union Central Executive Committee of the Union of the
Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia.”  

If the former should hold sessions once a week, and the latter once a
week (or once a fortnight even), this may be easily arranged.  

The important thing is not to provide material for the
“pro-independence” people, not to destroy their independence,
but to create another new storey, a federation of equal
republics.  

The second part of Clause 2 could stand: the dissatisfied will appeal
(against decisions of the Council of Labour and Defence, and the
Council of People’s Commissars) to the Federal All-Union Central
Executive Committee, without thereby suspending implementation
(just as in the R.S.F.S.R.).  

Clause 3 could stand, but its wording should be: “amalgamate in
federal People’s Commissariats whose seat shall be in Moscow, with
the proviso that the respective People’s Commissariats of the
R.S.F.S.R. have their authorised representatives with a small staff in all
the Republics that have joined the Union of Republics of Europe and
Asia.”  

Part 2 of Clause 3 remains; perhaps it could be said to emphasise
equality: “by agreement of the Central Executive Committees of
the member republics of the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and
Asia.”  

Let’s think about Part 3: perhaps we had better substitute
“mandatory” for “desirable”? Or perhaps insert
conditionally mandatory at least in the form of a request for
instructions and the authority to decide without such instructions
solely in cases of “specially urgent importance”?  

Clause 4 could perhaps also be “amalgamate by agreement of the Central
Executive Committees”?  

Perhaps add to Clause 5: “with the establishment of joint (or general)
conferences and congresses of a purely consultative nature (or perhaps
of a solely consultative nature)?




Appropriate alterations in the 1st and 2nd comments.  
 

Stalin has agreed to delay submission of the resolution to the
Political Bureau of the Central Committee until my return. I shall arrive
on Monday, October 2. I should like to see you and Rykov for about two
hours in the morning, say 12 noon to 2 p.m., and, if necessary, in the
evening, say 5-7 or 6-8.  

That is my tentative draft. I shall add or amend on the strength of
talks with Mdivani and other comrades. I beg you to do the same, and to
reply to me.  
Yours, 
Lenin

P. S. Send copies to all members of the Political Bureau.

 

Notes
 
 



[1]
On August 10, 1922, the Politbureau directed the Orgbureau to set up a
commission to go into the question of relations between the R.S. F.S.R. and
the independent national Soviet Republics in preparation for the next
plenary meeting of the Party’s Central Committee. This commission, set up
on August 11, consisted of J. V. Stalin, V. V. Kuibyshev,
G. K. Orjonikidze, K. G. Rakovsky, G. Y. Sokolnikov and representatives of
the national republics—S. A. Agamali-ogly (Azerbaijan), A. F. Myasnikov
(Armenia), P. G. Mdivani (Georgia), G. I. Petrovsky (Ukraine),
A. G. Chervyakov (Byelorussia) and others.  

Stalin drafted the commission’s resolution “On the Relations Between
the R.S. F.S.R. and the Independent Republics”, which provided for the
Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia entering the Russian
Federation as autonomous republics. Stalin’s draft was forwarded for
discussion to the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Soviet
national republics. It was supported by the Central Committees of the
Communist Parties of Azerbaijan and Armenia. The C.C. of the Georgian
Communist Party was against the draft resolution. At its meeting on
September 15, 1922, it passed the following decision by a majority vote:

“The union in the form of autonomisation of the independent republics
proposed on the basis of Stalin’s theses is premature. A union of economic
efforts and a common policy are necessary, but all attributes of
independence should be preserved.” The C.C. of the Byelorussian Communist
Party went on record for the preservation of treaty relations between the
independent republics. The C.C. of the Ukrainian C.P. did not discuss the
draft.  

The commission met on September 23 and 24, 1922, with V. M. Molotov in
the chair. It approved Stalin’s draft (with one abstention—the
representative from Georgia). In a special point the commission rejected
the resolution of the C.C. of the Georgian Communist Party. Stalin’s draft
was gone over point by point and approved by a majority with certain minor
amendments and addenda. Point 2 stating that the decisions of the
All-Russia Central Executive Committee, the Council of People’s Commissars
and the Council of Labour and Defence of the R.S.F.S.R. were binding upon
the corresponding bodies of the national republics was carried by an 8 to 1
majority (Mdivani voting against and Petrovsky abstaining).  

The final wording of the commission’s resolution, which Lenin deals
with in his letter to the members of the Politbureau, was as follows: 
 “1. It is considered advisable that treaties be concluded between the
Soviet Republics of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia
and the R.S.F.S.R. for their formal entry

   

into the R.S.F.S.R., the question of Bokhara, Kharezm and the Far-Eastern
Republic being left open and confined to agreements with them on customs
arrangements, foreign trade, foreign and military affairs, and so on.  

“Note: Corresponding changes in the constitutions of the Republics
mentioned in Point 1 and of the R.S.F.S.R. to be made after enactment by
Soviet procedure.  

“2. In accordance with this the decisions of the All-Russia Central
Executive Committee of the R.S.F.S.R. shall be considered binding upon the
central bodies of the republics mentioned in Point 1, while the decisions
of the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labour and Defence
of the R.S.F.S.R. shall be binding upon the unified commissariats of these
republics.  

“Note: These republics are to be represented on the Presidium of the
All-Russia C.E.C. of the R.S.F.S.R.  

“3. External affairs (foreign affairs and foreign trade), military affairs,
ways of communication (with the exception of local transport) and Potel (the
People’s Commissariat for Post and Telegraph—Ed.) of the republics
mentioned in Point 1 shall be merged with those of the R.S.F.S.R., the
corresponding commissariats of the R.S.F.S.R. having their agents and a small
staff in the republics.


“The agents are appointed by the People’s Commissars of the
R.S. F.S.R. by arrangement with the Central Executive Commit tees of the
republics.


“It is considered advisable that the republics concerned be represented on
the corresponding foreign agencies of the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Affairs and the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade.


“4. The Commissariats for Finance, Food, Labour and National Economy of the
republics shall be formally subject to the directives of the corresponding
R.S. F.S.R. commissariats.


“5. The remaining commissariats of the republics mentioned in Point 1,
namely, the Commissariats for Justice, Education, Internal Affairs, Agriculture,
Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, Public Health and Social Security, shall be
considered independent.


“Note 1: The agencies fighting counter-revolution in the aforementioned
republics shall be subject to the directives of the G.P.U. of the R.S.F.S.R.


“Note 2: The Central Executive Committees of the republics shall be granted
the right of amnesty only in civil cases.


“6. This decision, if approved by the C.C. of the R.C.P., shall not be
published, but shall be passed on to the national Central Committees as a
circular directive to be enacted through the Central Executive Committee or the
Congress of Soviets of the aforementioned republics pending the convocation of
an All Russia Congress of Soviets, at which it is to be declared as the desire
of these republics” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism of the C.C., C.P.S.U.).



On September 25 the commission’s materials (Stalin’s draft, the
resolution and minutes of the commission’s meetings, and the resolutions of
the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Georgia, Azerbaijan and
Armenia) were sent to Lenin at Gorki. Simultaneously, without waiting for
Lenin’s instructions and without the question being considered in the
Politbureau, the Secretariat of the C.C. sent the commission’s resolution
to all the members and alternate members of the C.C. in preparation for the
latter’s plenary meeting fixed for October 5.  

After studying the Commission’s material Lenin wrote his letter to the
members of the Politbureau which is published in this volume. The letter is
dated September 27; apparently this is a slip of the pen, since the
Registration Book of Lenin’s Letters, Notes and Instructions bears an entry
stating that this letter was forwarded to the members of the Politbureau on
September 26; moreover, Lenin’s conversation with Stalin, to which
reference is made in the letter, took place on September 26; it can be
inferred from this that Lenin’s letter was written on September 26.  

In his letter to the members of the Politbureau Lenin came out against
Stalin’s idea of “autonomisation” of the independent national Soviet
Republics and suggested a fundamentally different way of uniting them by
creating a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (see also Lenin’s letter
“The Question of Nationalities or ‘Autonomisation’\null”, present
edition, Vol. 36, pp. 605–11).  

In accordance with Lenin’s proposals the resolution drafted by the
C.C.’s Commission was revised.  

The new resolution was worded as follows: 
 “1. It is considered necessary that a treaty be concluded between the
Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Federation of Transcaucasian Republics and the
R.S.F.S.R. for their amalgamation in a Union of Socialist Soviet Republics,
each reserving the right to freely secede from membership of the Union.


“2. The supreme body of the Union shall be the Union Central Executive
Committee consisting of representatives of the central executive committees
of the R.S.F.S.R., the Transcaucasian Federation, the Ukraine and
Byelorussia pro rata to the population they represent.  

“3. The executive organ of the Union C.E.C. shall be the Union Council of
People’s Commissars appointed by the Union
C.E.C.

“4. The People’s Commissariats for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade,
Military Affairs, Railways and Post and Telegraph of the republics and
federations comprising the Union shall be merged with those of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics, the corresponding commissariats of the Union of
Republics having in the republics and federations their agents and a small staff
appoint ed by the People’s Commissars of the Union by arrangement with the
Central Executive Committees of the federations and republics.


“Note: It is considered necessary for the republics concerned to be
represented on the corresponding foreign agencies of the

   

People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and the People’s Commissariat for
Foreign Trade.  

“5. The People’s Commissariats for Finance, Food, National Economy,
Labour and Inspection of the republics and federations comprising the Union
of Republics, also the central agencies for fighting counter-revolution
shall be subject to the directives of the corresponding People’s
Commissariats and to the decisions of the Council of People s Commissars
and the Council of Labour and Defence of the Union of Republics.  

“6. The remaining people’s commissariats comprising the Union of
Republics, namely, the Commissariats for Justice, Education, Internal
Affairs, Agriculture, Public Health and Social Security shall be considered
independent” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism
of the C.C. of the C.P.S.U.).  

On October 6, 1922, the day on which the question of the relations
between the R.S. F.S.R. and the independent republics was discussed at the
plenary meeting of the C.C., Lenin, who was unable to attend the meeting,
wrote a note to Kamenev urging the need for combating dominant-nation
chauvinism and pro posing an addendum to the resolution saying that
representatives of all the uniting republics should take their turn in
presiding at the Union Central Executive Committee (see Collected
Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol. 45, p. 214).  
 The C.C. plenum fully supported Lenin, adopted a resolution in the form
of C.C. directives based on his proposals, and instruct ed a new commission
to draft a bill on the formation of the U.S.S.R. for submission to the
Congress of Soviets. The members of the C.C. in their speeches strongly
denounced all manifestations of dominant-nation chauvinism. At the same
time the plenum rebuffed Mdivani, who at first objected to the formation of
the U.S.S.R. and then insisted on Georgia joining the U.S.S.R. directly,
and not through the Transcaucasian Federation.  

Guided by Lenin’s instructions, the Central Committee of the Party
directed all the subsequent work of uniting the republics.  
 On December 30, 1922, the First All-Union Congress of Soviets met to
form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

      To The Fourth Congress Of The Communist International And To The Petrograd
      Soviet Of Workers’ And Red Army Deputies

      I regret very much that I cannot be present at the first session of the
      Congress and that I must confine myself to greetings in writing. 
 Notwithstanding the enormous obstacles confronting the Communist
    Parties, the Communist International is growing and becoming strong. The
    main goal is still to win over the majority of the workers. We shall attain
    this goal in spite of everything. 
 The amalgamation of the Second and Two-and-a-Half Internationals will
    benefit the proletarian revolutionary movement: less fiction and less fraud
    is always to the benefit of the working class. 
 To the Petrograd workers and their newly-elected Soviet who are hosts to
    the Fourth Congress of the Communist International, I send my best wishes
    and cordial greetings. 
 The Petrograd workers must be in the foremost ranks on the economic
    front, too. We rejoice to hear about the beginning of the economic revival
    of Petrograd. I hope to be able to accept your invitation to visit Petrograd
    in the near future. 
 Soviet rule in Russia is celebrating its fifth anniversary. It is now
    sounder than ever. The Civil War is over. The first successes in the
    economic field have been achieved. Soviet Russia considers it a matter of
    the greatest pride to help the workers of the whole world in their difficult
    struggle to overthrow capitalism. Victory will be ours. 
 Long live the Communist International!

      13, 1922
(Comrade Lenin is met with stormy, prolonged applause and a general
    ovation. All rise and join in singing “The Internationale".)
    Comrades, I am down in the list as the main speaker, but you will understand
    that after my lengthy illness I am not able to make a long report. I can
    only make a few introductory remarks on the key questions. My subject will
    be a very limited one. The subject, “Five Years of the Russian
    Revolution and the Prospects of the World Revolution", is in general too
    broad and too large for one speaker to exhaust in a single speech. That is
    why I shall take only a small part of this subject, namely, the question of
    the New Economic Policy. I have deliberately taken only this small part in
    order to make you familiar with what is now the most important
    question—at all events, it is the most important to me, because I am
    now working on it. 
 And so, I shall tell you how we launched the New Economic Policy, and
    what results we have achieved with the aid of this policy. If I confine
    myself to this question, I shall, perhaps, succeed in giving you a general
    survey and a general idea of it. 
 To begin with how we arrived at the New Economic Policy, I must quote
    from an article I wrote in 1918.[2] At the beginning of 1918, in a brief polemic, I
    touched on the question of the attitude we should adopt towards state
    capitalism. I then wrote: 
 “State capitalism would be a step forward as compared with the
    present state of affairs (i.e., the state of affairs  at that time) in our
    Soviet Republic. If in approximately six months’ time state capitalism
    became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a sure
    guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a permanently firm
    hold and will have become invincible in our country.” 
 Of course, this was said at a time when we were more foolish than we are
    now, but not so foolish as to be unable to deal with such matters. 
 Thus, in 1918, I was of the opinion that with regard to the economic
    situation then obtaihing in the Soviet Republic, state capitalism would be a
    step forward. This sounds very strange, and perhaps even absurd, for already
    at that time our Republic was a socialist republic and we were every day
    hastily—perhaps too hastily—adopting various new economic
    measures which could not be described as anything but socialist
    measures. Nevertheless, I then held the view that in relation to the
    economic situation then obtaining in the Soviet Republic state capitalism
    would be a step forward, and I explained my idea simply by enumerating the
    elements of the economic system of Russia. In my opinion these elements were
    the following: “(1) patriarchal, i.e., the most primitive form of
    agriculture; (2) small commodity production (this includes the majority of
    the peasants who trade in grain); (3) private capitalism; (4) state
    capitalism, and (5) socialism.” All these economic elements were
    present in Russia at that time. I set myself the task of explaining the
    relationship of these elements to each other, and whether one of the
    non-socialist elements, namely, state capitalism, should not be rated higher
    than socialism. I repeat: it seems very strange to everyone that a
    non-socialist element should be rated higher than, regarded as superior to,
    socialism in a republic which declares itself a socialist republic But the
    fact will become intelligible if you recall that we definitely did not
    regard the economic system of Russia as something homogeneous and highly
    developed; we were fully aware that in Russia we had patriarchal
    agriculture, i.e., the most primitive form of agriculture, alongside the
    socialist form. What role could state capitalism play in these
    circumstances? 
 I then asked myself which of these elements predominated? Clearly, in a
    petty-bourgeois environmcnt the petty-bourgeois element predominates. I
    recognised then that the petty-bourgeois element predominated; it was
    impossible to take a different view. The question I then put to
    myself—this was in a specific controversy which had nothing to do with
    the present question—was: what is our attitude towards state
    capitalism? And I replied: although it is not a socialist form, state
    capitalism would be for us, and for Russia, a more favourable form than the
    existing one. What does that show? It shows that we did not overrate either
    the rudiments or the principles of socialist economy, although we had
    already accomplished the social revolution. On the contrary, at that time we
    already realised to a certain extent that it would be better if we first
    arrived at state capitalism and only after that at socialism. 
 I must lay special emphasis on this, because I assume that it is the
    only point of departure we can take, firstly, to explain what the present
    economic policy is; and, secondly, to draw very important practical
    conclusions for the Communist International. I do not want to suggest that
    we had then a ready-made plan of retreat. This was not the case. Those brief
    lines set forth in a polemic were not by any means a plan of retreat. For
    example, they made no mention whatever of that very important point, freedom
    to trade, which is of fundamental significance to state capitalism. Yet they
    did contain a general, even if indefinite, idea of retreat. I think that we
    should take note of that not only from the viewpoint of a country whose
    economic system was, and is to this day, very backward, but also from the
    viewpoint of the Communist International and the advanced West-European
    countries. For example, just now we are engaged in drawing up a programme. I
    personally think that it would be best to hold simply a general discussion
    on all the programmes, to make the first reading, so to speak, and to get
    them printed, but not to take a final decision now, this year. Why? First of
    all, of course, because I do not think we have considered all of them in
    sufficient detail, and also because we have given scarcely any thought to
    possible retreat, and to preparationg for it. Yet that is a question which,
    in view of such fundamental changes in the world as the overthrow of
    capitalism and the building of socialism with all its enormous difficulties,
    absolutely  requires our attention. We must not only know how to act when we
    pass directly to the offensive and are victorious. In revolutionary times
    this is not so difficult, nor so very important; at least, it is not the
    most decisive thing. There are always times in a revolution when the
    opponent loses his head; and if we attack him at such a time we may win an
    easy victory. But that is nothing, because our enemy, if he has enough
    endurance, can rally his forces beforehand, and so forth. He can easily
    provoke us to attack him and then throw us back for many years. For this
    reason, I think, the idea that we must prepare for ourselves the possibility
    of retreat is very important, and not only from the theoretical point of
    view. From the practical point of view, too, all the parties which are
    preparing to take the direct offensive against capitalism in the near future
    must now give thought to the problem of preparing for a possible retreat. I
    think it will do us no harm to learn this lesson together with all the other
    lessons which the experience of our revolution offers. On the contrary, it
    may prove beneficial in many cases. 
 Now that I have emphasised the fact that as early as 1918 we regarded
    state capitalism as a possible line of retreat, I shall deal with the
    results of our New Economic Policy. I repeat: at that time it was still a
    very vague idea, but in 1921, after we had passed through the most important
    stage of the Civil War—and passed through it victoriously—we
    felt the impact of a grave—I think it was the gravest—internal
    political crisis in Soviet Russia. This internal crisis brought to light
    discontent not only among a considerable section of the peasantry but also
    among the workers. This was the first and, I hope, the last time in the
    history of Soviet Russia that feeling ran against us among large masses of
    peasants, not consciously but instinctively. What gave rise to this
    peculiar, and for us, of course, very unpleasant, situation? The reason for
    it was that in our economic offensive we had run too far ahead, that we had
    not provided ourselves with adequate resources, that the masses sensed what
    we ourselves were not then able to formulate consciously but what we
    admitted soon after, a few weeks later, namely, that the direct transition
    to purely socialist forms, to purely socialist distribution, was beyond our
    available strength, and that if we were unable to effect a retreat so as to
    confine ourselves to easier tasks, we would face disaster. The crisis began,
    I think, in February 1921. In the spring of that year we decided
    unanimously—I did not observe any considerable disagreement among us
    on this question—to adopt the New Economic Policy. Now, after eighteen
    months have elapsed, at the close of 1922, we are able to make certain
    comparisons. What has happened? How have we fared during this period of over
    eighteen months? What is the result? Has this retreat been of any benefit to
    us? Has it really saved us, or is the result still indefinite? This is the
    main question that I put to myself, and I think that this main question is
    also of first-rate importance to all the Communist Parties; for if the reply
    is in the negative, we are all doomed. I think that all of us can, with a
    clear conscience, reply to this question in the affirmative, namely, that
    the past eighteen months provide positive and absolute proof that we have
    passed the test. 
 I shall now try to prove this. To do that I must briefly enumerate all
    the constituent parts of our economy. 
 First of all I shall deal with our financial system and our famous
    Russian ruble. I think we can say that Russian rubles are famous, if only
    for the reason that their number now in circulation exceeds a
    quadrillion. (Laughter.) That is something! It is an astronomical
    figure. I am sure that not everyone here knows what this figure
    signifies. (General laughter.) But we do not think that the figure
    is so very important even from the point of view of economic science, for
    the noughts can always be crossed out. (Laughter.) We have achieved
    a thing or two in this art, which is likewise of no importance from the
    economic point of view, and I am sure that in the further course of events
    we shall achieve much more. But what is really important is the problem of
    stabilising the ruble. We are now grappling with this problem, our best
    forces are working on it, and we attach decisive importance to it. If we
    succeed in stabilising the ruble for a long period, and then for all time,
    it will prove that we have won. In that case all these astronomical figures,
    these trillions and quadrillions, will not have mattered in the least. We
    shall then be able to place our economy  on a firm basis, and develop it
    further on a firm basis. On this question I think I can cite some fairly
    important and decisive data. In 1921 the rate of exchange of the paper ruble
    remained stable for a period of less than three months. This year, 1922,
    which has not yet drawn to a close, the rate remained stable for a period of
    over five months. I think that this proof is sufficient. Of course, if you
    demand scientific proof that we shall definitely solve this problem, then it
    is not sufficient; but in general, I do not think it is possible to prove
    this entirely and conclusively. The data I have cited show that between last
    year, when we started on the New Economic Policy, and the present day, we
    have already learned to make progress. Since we have learned to do this, I
    am sure we shall learn to achieve further successes along this road,
    provided we avoid doing anything very foolish. The most important thing,
    however, is trade, namely, the circulation of commodities, which is
    essential for us. And since we have successfully coped with this problem for
    two years, in spite of having been in a state of war (for, as you know,
    Vladivostok was recaptured only a few weeks ago), and in spite of the fact
    that only now we are able to proceed with our economic activities in a
    really systematic way—since we have succeeded in keeping the rate of
    the paper ruble stable for five months instead of only three months, I think
    I can say that we have grounds to be pleased. After all, we stand alone. We
    have not received any loans, and are not receiving any now. We have been
    given no assistance by any of the powerful capitalist countries, which
    organise their capitalist economy so “brilliantly” that they do
    not know to this day which way they are going. By the Treaty of Versailles
    they have created a financial system that they themselves cannot make head
    or tail of. If these great capitalist countries are managing things in this
    way, I think that we, backward and uneducated as we are, may be pleased with
    the fact that we have grasped the most important thing—the conditions
    for the stabilisation of the ruble. This is proved not by theoretical
    analysis but by practical experience, which in my opinion is more important
    than all the theoretical discussions in the world. Practice shows that we
    have achieved decisive results in that field, namely, we are beginning to
    push our economy towards the stabilisation of the ruble, which is of supreme
    importance for trade, for the free circulation of commodities, for the
    peasants, and for the vast masses of small producers. 
 Now I come to our social objectives. The most important factor, of
    course, is the peasantry. In 1921 discontent undoubtedly prevailed among a
    vast section of the peasantry. Then there was the famine. This was the
    severest trial for the peasants. Naturally, all our enemies abroad shouted:
    “There, that’s the result of socialist economy!” Quite
    naturally, of course, they said nothing about the famine actually being the
    terrible result of the Civil War. All the landowners and capitalists who had
    begun their offensive against us in 1918 tried to make out that the famine
    was the result of socialist economy. The famine was indeed a great and grave
    disaster which threatened to nullify the results of all our organisational
    and revolutionary efforts. 
 And so, I ask now, after this unprecedented and unexpected disaster,
    what is the position today, after we have introduced the New Economic
    Policy, after we have granted the peasants freedom to trade? The answer is
    clear and obvious to everyone; in one year the peasants have not only got
    over the famine, but have paid so much tax in kind that we have already
    received hundreds of millions of poods of grain, and that almost without
    employing any measures of coercion. Peasant uprisings, which previously,
    before 1921, were, so to speak, a common occurrence in Russia, have almost
    completely ceased. The peasants are satisfied with their present
    position. We can confidently assert that. We think that this evidence is
    more important than any amount of statistical proof. Nobody questions the
    fact that the peasants are a decisive factor in our country. And the
    position of the peasantry is now such that we have no reason to fear any
    movement against us from that quarter. We say that quite consciously,
    without exaggeration. This we have already achieved. The peasantry may be
    dissatisfied with one aspect or another of the work of our authorites. They
    may complain about this. That is possible, of course, and inevitable,
    because our machinery of state and our state-operated economy are still too
    inefficient to avert it; but any serious dissatisfaction with us on the part
    of  the peasantry as a whole is quite out of the question. This has been
    achieved in the course of one year. I think that is already quite a
    lot. 
 Now I come to our light industry. In industry we have to make a
    distinction between heavy and light industry because the situation in them
    is different. As regards light industry, I can safely say that there is a
    general revival. I shall not go into details. I did not set out to quote a
    lot of statistics. But this general impression is based on facts, and I can
    assure you that it is not based on anything untrue or inaccurate. We can
    speak of a general revival in light industry, and, as a result, of a
    definite improvement in the conditions of the workers in Petrograd and
    Moscow. In other districts this is observed to a lesser degree, because
    heavy industry predominates in them. So this does not apply
    generally. Nevertheless, I repeat, light industry is undoubtedly on the
    upgrade, and the conditions of the workers in Petrograd and Moscow have
    unquestionably improved. In the spring of 1921 there was discontent among
    the workers in both these cities. That is definitely not the case now. We,
    who watch the conditions and mood of the workers from day to day, make no
    mistake on that score. 
 The third question is that of heavy industry. I must say that the
    situation here is still grave. Some turn for the better occurred in 1921-22,
    so that we may hope that the situation will improve in the near future. We
    have already gathered some of the resources necessary for this. In a
    capitalist country a loan of hundreds of millions would be required to
    improve the situation in heavy industry. No improvement would be possible
    without it. The economic history of the capitalist countries shows that
    heavy industry in backward countries can only be developed with the aid of
    long-term loans of hundreds of millions of dollars or gold rubles. We did
    not get such loans, and so far have received nothing. All that is now being
    written about concessions and so forth is not worth much more than the paper
    it is written on. We have written a great deal about this lately and in
    particular about the Urquhart concession. Yet I think our concessions policy
    is a very good one. However, we have not concluded a single profitable
    concession agreement so far. I ask you to bear that in mind. Thus, the
    situation in heavy industry is really a very grave problem for our backward
    country, because we cannot count on loans from the wealthy countries. In
    spite of that, we see a tangible improvement, and we also see that our
    trading has brought us some capital. True, it is only a very modest sum as
    yet—a little over twenty million gold rubles. At any rate, a beginning
    has been made; our trade is providing us with funds which we can employ for
    improving the situation in heavy industry. At the present moment, however,
    our heavy industry is still in great difficuities. But I think that the
    decisive circumstance is that we are already in a position to save a
    little. And we shall go on saving. We must economise now though it is often
    at the expense of the population. We are trying to reduce the state budget,
    to reduce staffs in our government offices. Later on, I shall have a few
    words to say about our state apparatus. At all events, we must reduce it. We
    must economise as much as possible. We are economising in all things, even
    in schools. We must do this, because we know that unless we save heavy
    industry, unless we restore it, we shall not be able to build up an industry
    at all; and without an industry we shall go under as an independent,
    country. We realise this very well. 
 The salvation of Russia lies not only in a good harvest on the peasant
    farms—that is not enough; and not only in the good condition of light
    industry, which provides the peasantry with consumer goods—this, too,
    is not enough; we also need heavy industry. And to put it in a good
    condition will require several years of work. 
 Heavy industry needs state subsidies. If we are not able to provide
    them, we shall be doomed as a civilised state, let alone as a socialist
    state. In this respect, we have taken a determined step. We have begun to
    accumulate the funds that we need to put heavy industry on its feet. True,
    the sum we have obtained so far barely exceeds twenty million gold rubles;
    but at any rate this sum is available, and it is earmarked exclusively for
    the purpose of reviving our heavy industry. 
 I think that, on the whole, I have, as I have promised, briefly outlined
    the principal elements of our economy, and feel that we may draw the
    conclusion from all this that the New Economic Policy has already yielded
    dividends. We already have proof that, as a state, we are able to trade, to
    maintain our strong positions in agriculture and industry, and to make
    progress. Practical activity has proved it. I think this is sufficient for
    us for the time being. We shall have to learn much, and we have realised
    that we still have much to learn. We have been in power for five years, and
    during these five years we have been in a state of war. Hence, we have been
    successful. 
 This is understandable, because the peasantry were on our side. Probably
    no one could have supported us more than they did. They were aware that the
    whiteguards had the landowners behind them, and they hate the landowners
    more than anything in the world. That is why the peasantry supported us with
    all their enthusiasm and loyalty. It was not difficult to get the peasantry
    to defend us against the whiteguards. The peasants, who had always hated
    war, did all they possibly could in the war against the whiteguards, in the
    Civil War against the landowners. But this was not all, because in substance
    it was only a matter of whether power would remain in the hands of the
    landowners or of the peasants. This was not enough for us. The peasants know
    that we have seized power for the workers and that our aim is to use this
    power to establish the socialist system. Therefore, the most important thing
    for us was to lay the economic foundation for socialist economy. We could
    not do it directly. We had to do it in a roundabout way. The state
    capitalism that we have introduced in our country is of a special kind. It
    does not agree with the usual conception of state capitalism. We hold all
    the key positions. We hold the land; it belongs to the state. This is very
    important, although our opponents try to make out that it is of no
    importance at all. That is untrue. The fact that the land belongs to the
    state is extremely important, and economically it is also of great practical
    purport. This we have achieved, and I must say that all our future
    activities should develop only within that framework. We have already
    succeeded in making the peasantry content and in reviving both industry and
    trade. I have already said that our state capitalism differs from state
    capitalism in the literal sense of the term in that our proletarian state
    not only owns the land, but also all the vital branches of industry. To
    begin with, we have leased only a certain number of the small and medium
    plants, but all the rest remain in our hands. As regards trade, I want to
    re-emphasise that we are trying to found mixed companies, that we are
    already forming them, i.e., companies in which part of the capital belongs
    to private capitalists—and foreign capitalists at that—and the
    other part belongs to the state. Firstly, in this way we are learning how to
    trade, and that is what we need. Secondly, we are always in a position to
    dissolve these companies if we deem it necessary, and do not, therefore, run
    any risks, so to speak. We are learning from the private capitalist and
    looking round to see how we can progress, and what mistakes we make. It
    seems to me that I need say no more. 
 I should still like to deal with several minor points. Undoubtedly, we
    have done, and will still do, a host of foolish things. No one can judge and
    see this better than I. (Laughter.) Why do we do these foolish
    things? The reason is clear: firstly, because we are a backward country;
    secondly, because education in our country is at a low level and thirdly,
    because we are getting no outside assistance. Not a single civilised country
    is helping us. On the contrary, they are all working against us. Fourthly,
    our machinery of state is to blame. We took over the old machinery of state,
    and that was our misfortune. Very often this machinery operates against
    us. In 1917, after we seized power, the government officials sabotaged
    us. This frightened us very much and we pleaded: “Please come
    back.” They all came back, but that was our misfortune. We now have a
    vast army of government employees, but lack sufficiently educated forces to
    exercise real control over them. In practice it often happens that here at
    the top, where we exercise political power, the machine functions somehow;
    but down below government employees have arbitrary control and they often
    exercise it in such a way as to counteract our measures. At the top, we
    have, I don’t know how many, but at all events, I think, no more than
    a few thousand, at the outside several tens of thousands of our own
    people. Down below, however, there are hundreds  of thousands of old
    officials whom we got from the tsar and from bourgeois society and who,
    partly deliberately and partly unwittingly, work against us. It is clear
    that nothing can be done in that respect overnight. It will take many years
    of hard work to improve the machinery, to remodel it, and to enlist new
    forces. We are doing this fairly quickly, perhaps too quickly. Soviet
    schools and Workers’ Faculties have been formed; a few hundred
    thousand young people are studying; they are studying too fast perhaps, but
    at all events, a start has been made, and I think this work will bear
    fruit. If we do not work too hurriedly we shall, in a few years’ time,
    have a large body of young people capable of thoroughly overhauling our
    state apparatus. 
 I have said that we have done a host of foolish things, but I must also
    say a word or two in this respect about our enemies. If our enemies blame us
    and say that Lenin himself admits that the Bolsheviks have done a host of
    foolish things, I want to reply to this: yes, but you know, the foolish
    things we have done are nonetheless very different from yours. We have only
    just begun to learn, but are learning so methodically that we are certain to
    achieve good results. But since our enemies, i.e., the capitalists and the
    heroes of the Second International, lay stress on the foolish things we have
    done, I take the liberty, for the sake of comparison, to cite the words of a
    celebrated Russian author, which I shall amend to read as follows: if the
    Bolsheviks do foolish things the Bolshevik says, “Twice two are five",
    but when their enemies, i.e., the capitalists and the heroes of the Second
    International, do foolish things, they get, “Twice two make a tallow
    candle”.[3] That is easily proved. Take, for example, the
    agreement concluded by the U.S.A., Great Britain, France and Japan with
    Kolchak. I ask you, are there any more enlightened and more powerful
    countries in the world? But what has happened? They promised to help Kolchak
    without calculation, without reflection, and without circumspection. It
    ended in a fiasco, which, it seems to me, is difficult for the human
    intellect to grasp. 
 Or take another example, a closer and more important one: the Treaty of
    Versailles. I ask you, what have the “great” powers which have
    “covered themselves with glory” done? How will they find a way
    out of this chaos and confusion? I don’t think it will be an
    exaggeration to repeat that the foolish things we have done are nothing
    compared with those done in concert by the capitalist countries, the
    capitalist world and the Second International. That is why I think that the
    outlook for the world revolution—a subject which I must touch on
    briefly—is favourable. And given a certain definite condition, I think
    it will be even better. I should like to say a few words about this. 
 At the Third Congress, in 1921, we adopted a resolution on the
    organisational structure of the Communist Parties and on the methods and
    content of their activities. The resolution is an excellent one, but it is
    almost entirely Russian, that is to say, everything in it is based on
    Russian conditions. This is its good point, but it is also its failing. It
    is its failing because I am sure that no foreigner can read it. I have read
    it again before saying this. In the first place, it is too long, containing
    fifty or more points. Foreigners are not usually able to read such
    things. Secondly, even if they read it, they will not understand it because
    it is too Russian. Not because it is written in Russian—it has been
    excellently translated into all languages—but because it is thoroughly
    imbued with the Russian spirit. And thirdly, if by way of exception some
    foreigner does understand it, he cannot carry it out. This is its third
    defect. I have talked with a few of the foreign delegates and hope to
    discuss matters in detail with a large number of delegates from different
    countries during the Congress, although I shall not take part in its
    proceedings, for unfortunately it is impossible for me to do that. I have
    the impression that we made a big mistake with this resolution, namely, that
    we blocked our own road to further success. As I have said already, the
    resolution is excellently drafted; I am prepared to subscribe to every one
    of its fifty or more points. But we have not learnt how to present our
    Russian experience to foreigners. All that was said in the resolution has
    remained a dead letter. If we do not realise this, we shall be unable to
    move ahead. I think that after five years of the Russian revolution the
    most important thing for all of us, Russian and foreign comrades alike, is
    to sit down and study. We have only now obtained the opportunity to do so. I
    do not know how long this opportunity will last. I do not know for how long
    the capitalist powers will give us the opportunity to study in peace. But we
    must take advantage of every moment of respite from fighting, from war, to
    study, and to study from scratch. 
 The whole Party and all strata of the population of Russia prove this by
    their thirst for knowledge. This striving to learn shows that our most
    important task today is to study and to study hard. Our foreign comrades,
    too, must study. I do not mean that they have to learn to read and write and
    to understand what they read, as we still have to do. There is a dispute as
    to whether this concerns proletarian or bourgeois culture. I shall leave
    that question open. But one thing is certain: we have to begin by learning
    to read and write and to understand what we read. Foreigners do not need
    that. They need something more advanced: first of all, among other things
    they must learn to understand what we have written about the organisational
    structure of the Communist Parties, and what the foreign comrades have
    signed without reading and understanding. This must be their first
    task. That resolution must be carried out. It cannot be carried out
    overnight; that is absolutely impossible. The resolution is too Russian, it
    reflects Russian experience. That is why it is quite unintelligible to
    foreigners, and they cannot be content with hanging it in a corner like an
    icon and praying to it. Nothing will be achieved that way. They must
    assimilate part of the Russian experience. Just how that will be done, I do
    not know. The fascists in Italy may, for example, render us a great service
    by showing the Italians that they are not yet sufficiently enlightened and
    that their country is not yet ensured against the Black Hundreds.[4] Perhaps
    this will be very useful. We Russians must also find ways and means of
    explaining the principles of this resolution to the foreigners. Unless we do
    that, it will be absolutely impossible for them to carry it out. I am sure
    that in this connection we must tell not only the Russians, but the foreign
    comrades as well, that the most important thing in the period we are now
    entering is to study. We are study ing in the general sense. They, however,
    must study in the special sense, in order that they may really understand
    the organisation, structure, method and content of revolutionary work. If
    they do that, I am sure the prospects of the world revolution will be not
    only good, but excellent. (Stormy, prolonged applause. Shouts
    of  “Long live our Comrade Lenin!” evoke a fresh stormy
    ovation.)

    Fourth Congress of the Communist International took place on
    November 5-December 5, 1922. It opened in Petrograd and then, from November
    9 onwards, the sittings were held in Moscow. It was attended by 408
    delegates, 343 of whom had a casting vote, representing 58 Communist
    organisations in various countries. Also present were representatives of the
    Italian Socialist Party, the Iceland Workers’ Party, the Mongolian
    People’s Revolutionaary Party, the Workers Party of the U.S.; the
    Young Communist International, the Profintern, the International
    Women’s Secretariat, the International Workers’ Aid and
    U.S. Negro Organisation. The Congress endorsed the theses on a united
    workers’ front, drawn up by the R.C.P.(B.), approved the theses on the
    tactics of the Communist International, on the tasks of Communists in the
    trade union movement, and on the Eastern question, and adopted a resolution
    on the socialist revolution in Russia, on the Young Communist International
    and other questions.

 (Stormy applause.  “The Internationale” is sung. ) Comrades, I regret very much and apologise that I have been unable to come to your session earlier. As far as I know you intended a few weeks ago to give me an opportunity of attending the Moscow Soviet. I could not come because after my illness, from December onwards, I was incapacitated, to use the professional term, for quite a long time, and because of this reduced ability to work had to postpone my present address from week to week. A very considerable portion of my work which, as you will remember, I had first piled on Comrade Tsyurupa, and then on Comrade Rykov, I also had to pile additionally on Comrade Kamenev. And I must say that, to employ a simile I have already used, he was suddenly burdened with two loads. Though, to continue the simile, it should be said that the horse has proved to be an exceptionally capable and zealous one. (Applause.) All the same, however, nobody is supposed to drag two loads, and I am now waiting impatiently for Comrades Tsyurupa and Rykov to return, and we shall divide up the work at least a little more fairly. As for myself, in view of my reduced ability to work it takes me much more time to look into matters than I should like.
In December 1921, when I had to stop working altogether, it was the year’s end. We were effecting the transition to the New Economic Policy, and it turned out already then that, although we had embarked upon this transition in the beginning of 1921, it was quite a difficult, I would say a very difficult, transition. We have now been effecting this transition for more than eighteen months, and one would think that it was time the majority took up new places and disposed themselves according to the new conditions, particularly those of the New Economic Policy.
As to foreign policy, we had the fewest changes in that field. We pursued the line that we had adopted earlier, and I think I can say with a clear conscience that we pursued it quite consistently and with enormous success. There is no need, I think, to deal with that in detail; the capture of Vladivostok, the ensuing demonstration and the declaration of federation which you read in the press[2]the other day have proved and shown with the utmost clarity that no changes are necessary in this respect. The road we are on is absolutely clearly and well defined, and has ensured us success in face of all the countries of the world, although some of them are still prepared to declare that they refuse to sit at one table with us. Nevertheless, economic relations, followed by diplomatic relations, are improving, must improve, and certainly will improve. Every country which resists this risks being late, and, perhaps in some quite substantial things, it risks being at a disadvantage. All of us see this now, and not only from the press, from the newspapers. I think that in their trips abroad comrades are also finding the changes very great. In that respect, to use an old simile, we have not changed to other trains, or to other conveyances.
But as regards our home policy, the change we made in the spring of 1921, which was necessitated by such extremely powerful and convincing circumstances that no debates or disagreements arose among us about it—that change continues to cause us some difficulties, great difficulties, I would say. Not because we have any doubts about the need for the turn—no doubts exist in that respect—not because we have any doubts as to whether the test of our New Economic Policy has yielded the successes we expected. No doubts exist on that score—I can say this quite definitely—either in the ranks of our Party or in the ranks of the huge mass of non-Party workers and peasants.
  In this sense the problem presents no difficulties. The difficulties we have stem from our being faced with a task whose solution very often requires the services of new people, extraordinary measures and extraordinary methods. Doubts still exist among us as to whether this or that is correct. There are changes in one direction or another. And it should be said that both will continue for quite a long time. “The New Economic Policy!” A strange title. It was called a New Economic Policy because it turned things back. We are now retreating, going back, as it were; but we are doing so in order, after first retreating, to take a running start and make a bigger leap forward. It was on this condition alone that we retreated in pursuing our New Economic Policy. Where and how we must now regroup, adapt and reorganise in order to start a most stubborn offensive after our retreat, we do not yet know. To carry out all these operations properly we need, as the proverb says, to look not ten but a hundred times before we leap. We must do so in order to cope with the incredible difficulties we encounter in dealing with all our tasks and problems. You know perfectly well what sacrifices have been made to achieve what has been achieved; you know how long the Civil War has dragged on and what effort it has cost. Well now, the capture of Vladivostok has shown all of us (though Vladivostok is a long way off, it is after all one of our own towns) (prolonged applause ) everybody’s desire to join us, to join in our achievements. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic now stretches from here to there. This desire has rid us both of our civil enemies and of the foreign enemies who attacked us. I am referring to Japan.
We have won quite a definite diplomatic position, recognised by the whole world. All of you see it. You see its results, but how much time we needed to get it! We have now won the recognition of our rights by our enemies both in economic and in commercial policy. This is proved by the conclusion of trade agreements.
We can see why we, who eighteen months ago took the path of the so-called New Economic Policy, are finding it so incredibly difficult to advance along that path. We live in a country devastated so severely by war, knocked out of anything like the normal course of life, in a country that has suffered and endured so much, that willy-nilly we are beginning all our calculations with a very, very small percentage—the pre-war percentage. We apply this yardstick to the conditions of our life, we sometimes do so very impatiently, heatedly, and always end up with the conviction that the difficulties are vast. The task we have set ourselves in this field seems all the more vast because we are comparing it with the state of affairs in any ordinary bourgeois country. We have set ourselves this task because we understood that it was no use expecting the wealthy powers to give us the assistance usually forthcoming under such circumstances.[3] After the Civil War we have been subjected to very nearly a boycott, that is, we have been told that the economic ties that are customary and normal in the capitalist world will not be maintained in our case.
Over eighteen months have passed since we undertook the New Economic Policy, and even a longer period has passed since we concluded our first international treaty. Nonetheless, this boycott of us by all the bourgeoisie and all governments continues to be felt. We could not count on anything else when we adopted the new economic conditions; yet we had no doubt that we had to make the change and achieve success single-handed. The further we go, the clearer it becomes that any aid that may be rendered to us, that will be rendered to us by the capitalist powers, will, far from eliminating this condition, in all likelihood and in the overwhelming majority of cases intensify it, accentuate it still further. “Single-handed”—we told ourselves. “Single-handed”—we are told by almost every capitalist country with which we have concluded any deals, with which we have undertaken any engagements, with which we have begun any negotiations. And that is where the special difficulty lies. We must realise this difficulty. We have built up our own political system in more than three years of work, incredibly hard work that was incredibly full of heroism. In the position in which we were till now we had no time to see whether we would smash something needlessly, no time to see whether there would be many sacrifices, because there were sacrifices enough, because the struggle which we then began (you know this perfectly well and there is no need to dwell on it) was a life-and-death struggle against the old social system, against which we fought to forge for ourselves a right to existence, to peaceful development. And we have won it. It is not we who say this, it is not the testimony of witnesses who may be accused of being partial to us. It is the testimony of witnesses who are in the camp of our enemies and who are naturally partial—not in our favour, however, but against us. These witnesses were in Denikin’s camp. They directed the occupation. And we know that their partiality cost us very dear, cost us colossal destruction. We suffered all sorts of losses on their account, and lost values of all kinds, including the greatest of all values—human lives—on an incredibly large scale. Now we must scrutinise our tasks most carefully and understand that the main task will be not to give up our previous gains. We shall not give up a single one of our old gains. (Applause. ) Yet we are also faced with an entirely new task; the old may prove a downright obstacle. To understand this task is most difficult. Yet it must be understood, so that we may learn how to work when, so to speak, it is necessary to turn ourselves inside out. I think, comrades, that these words and slogans are understandable, because for nearly a year, during my enforced absence, you have had in practice, handling the jobs on hand, to speak and think of this in various ways and on hundreds of occasions, and I am confident that your reflections on that score can only lead to one conclusion, namely, that today we must display still more of the flexibility which we employed till now in the Civil War.
We must not abandon the old. The series of concessions that adapt us to the capitalist powers is a series of concessions that enables them to make contact with us, ensures them a profit which is sometimes bigger, perhaps, than it should be. At the same time, we are conceding but a little part of the means of production, which are held almost entirely by our state. The other day the papers discussed the concession proposed by the Englishman Urquhart, who has hitherto been against us almost throughout the Civil War. He used to say: “We shall achieve our aim in the Civil War against Russia, against the Russia that has dared to deprive us of this and of that.” And after all that we had to enter into negotiations with him. We did not refuse them, we undertook them with the greatest joy, but we said: “Beg your pardon, but we shall not give up what we have won. Our Russia is so big, our economic potentialities are so numerous, and we feel justified in not rejecting your kind proposal, but we shall discuss it soberly, like businessmen.” True, nothing came of our first talk, because we could not agree to his proposal for political reasons. We had to reject it. So long as the British did not entertain the possibility of our participating in the negotiations on the Straits, the Dardanelles, we had to reject it, but right after doing so we had to start examining the matter in substance. We discussed whether or not it was of advantage to us, whether we would profit from concluding this concession agreement, and if so, under what circumstances it would be profitable. We had to talk about the price. That, comrades, is what shows you clearly how much our present approach to problems should differ from our former approach. Formerly the Communist said: “I give my life", and it seemed very simple to him, although it was not always so simple. Now, however, we Communists face quite another task. We must now take all things into account, and each of you must learn to be prudent. We must calculate how, in the capitalist environment, we can ensure our existence, how we can profit by our enemies, who, of course, will bargain, who have never forgotten how to bargain and will bargain at our expense. We are not forgetting that either, and do not in the least imagine commercial people anywhere turning into lambs and, having turned into lambs, offering us blessings of all sorts for nothing. That does not happen, and we do not expect it, but count on the fact that we, who are accustomed to putting up a fight, will find a way out and prove capable of trading, and profiting, and emerging safely from difficult economic situations. That is a very difficult task. That is the task we are working on now. I should like us to realise clearly how great is the abyss between the old and the new tasks. However great the abyss may be, we learned to manoeuvre during the war, and we must understand that the manoeuvre we now have to perform, in the midst of which we now are, is the most difficult one. But then it seems to be our last manoeuvre. We must test our strength in this field and prove that we have learned more than just the lessons of yesterday and do not just keep repeating the fundamentals. Nothing of the kind. We have begun to relearn, and shall relearn in such a way that we shall achieve definite and obvious success. And it is for the sake of this relearning, I think, that we must again firmly promise one another that under the name of the New Economic Policy we have turned back, but turned back in such a way as to surrender nothing of the new, and yet to give the capitalists such advantages as will compel any state, however hostile to us, to establish contacts and to deal with us. Comrade Krasin, who has had many talks with Urquhart, the head and backbone of the whole intervention, said that Urquhart, after all his attempts to foist the old system on us at all costs, throughout Russia, seated himself at the same table with him, with Krasin, and began asking: “What’s the price? How much? For how many years?” (Applause.) This is still quite far from our concluding concession deals and thus entering into treaty relations that are perfectly precise and binding—from the viewpoint of bourgeois society—but we can already see that we are coming to it, have nearly come to it, but have not quite arrived. We must admit that, comrades, and not be swell-headed. We are still far from having fully achieved the things that will make us strong, self-reliant and calmly confident that no capitalist deals can frighten us, calmly confident that however difficult a deal may be we shall conclude it, we shall get to the bottom of it and settle it. That is why the work—both political and Party—that we have begun in this sphere must be continued, and that is why we must change from the old methods to entirely new ones.
  We still have the old machinery, and our task now is to remould it along new lines. We cannot do so at once, but we must see to it that the Communists we have are properly placed. What we need is that they, the Communists, should control the machinery they are assigned to, and not, as so often happens with us, that the machinery should control them. We should make no secret of it, and speak of it frankly. Such are the tasks and the difficulties that confront us—and that at a moment when we have set out on our practical path, when we must not approach socialism as if it were an icon painted in festive colours. We need to take the right direction, we need to see that everything is checked, that the masses, the entire population, check the path we follow and say: “Yes, this is better than the old system.” That is the task we have set ourselves. Our Party, a little group of people in comparison with the country’s total population, has tackled this job. This tiny nucleus has set itself the task of remaking everything, and it will do so. We have proved that this is no utopia but a cause which people live by. We have all seen this. This has already been done. We must remake things in such a way that the great majority of the masses, the peasants and workers, will say: “It is not you who praise yourselves, but we. We say that you have achieved splendid results, after which no intelligent person will ever dream of returning to the old.” We have not reached that point yet. That is why NEP remains the main, current, and all embracing slogan of today.We shall not forget a single one of the slogans we learned yesterday. We can say that quite calmly, without the slightest hesitation, say it to anybody, and every step we take demonstrates it. But we still have to adapt ourselves to the New Economic Policy. We must know how to overcome, to reduce to a definite minimum all its negative features, which there is no need to enumerate and which you know perfectly well. We must know how to arrange everything shrewdly. Our legislation gives us every opportunity to do so. Shall we be able to get things going properly? That is still-far from being settled. We are making a study of things. Every issue of our Party newspaper offers you a dozen articles which tell you that at such-and-such a factory, owned by so-and-so, the rental terms are such-and-such, whereas at another, where our Communist comrade is the manager, the terms are such-and-such. Does it yield a profit or not, does it pay its way or not? We have approached the very core of the everyday problems, and that is a tremendous achievement. Socialism is no longer a matter of the distant future, or an abstract picture, or an icon. Our opinion of icons is the same—a very bad one. We have brought socialism into everyday life and must here see how matters stand. That is the task of our day, the task of our epoch. Permit me to conclude by expressing confidence that difficult as this task may be, new as it may be compared with our previous task, and numerous as the difficulties may be that it entails, we shall all—not in a day, but in a few years—all of us together fulfil it whatever the cost, so that NEP Russia will become socialist Russia. (Stormy, prolonged applause.)

      These letters, and those that follow (See Lenin's Last

      taken. These works offer Lenin's early and incredibly insightful
      critique of the Soviet government, and critique some of its

The recent publication of the report on literacy among the
    population of Russia, based on the census of 1920 (Literacy in
    Russia, issued by the Central Statistical Board, Public Education
    Section, Moscow, 1922), is a very important event. 
  Below I quote a table from this report on the state of literacy among
    the population of Russia in 1897 and 1920.

 At a time when we hold forth on proletarian culture and the relation in
    which it stands to bourgeois culture, facts and figures reveal that we are
    in a very bad way even as far as bourgeois culture is concerned. As might
    have been expected, it appears that we are still a very long way from
    attaining universal literacy, and that even compared with tsarist times
    (1897) our progress has been far too slow. This should serve as a stern
    warning and reproach to those who have been soaring in the empyreal heights
    of "proletarian culture". It shows what a vast amount of urgent spade-work
    we still have to do to reach the standard of an ordinary West-European
    civilised country.

    It also shows what a vast amount of work we have to do today to achieve,
    on the basis of our proletarian gains, anything like a real cultural
    standard. 
  We must not confine ourselves to this incontrovertible but too
    theoretical proposition. The very next time we revise our quarterly budget
    we must take this matter up in a practical way as well. In the first place,
    of course, we shall have to cut down the expenditure of government
    departments other than the People’s Commissariat of Education, and the
    sums thus released should be assigned for the latter’s needs. In a
    year like the present, when we are relatively well supplied, we must not be
    chary in increasing the bread ration for schoolteachers. 
  Generally speaking, it cannot be said that the work now being done in
    public education is too narrow. Quite a lot is being done to get the old
    teachers out of their rut, to attract them to the new problems, to rouse
    their interest in new methods of education, and in such problems as
    religion. 
  But we are not doing the main thing. We are not doing anything—or
    doing far from enough—to raise the school teacher to the level that is
    absolutely essential if we want any culture at all, proletarian or even
    bourgeois. We must bear in mind the semi-Asiatic ignorance from which we
    have not yet extricated ourselves, and from which we cannot extricate
    ourselves without strenuous effort—although we have every opportunity
    to do so, because nowhere are the masses of the people so interested in real
    culture as they are in our country; nowhere are the problems of this culture
    tackled so thoroughly and consistently as they are in our country; in no
    other country is state power in the hands of the working class which, in its
    mass, is fully aware of the deficiencies, I shall not say of its culture,
    but of its literacy; nowhere is the working class so ready to make, and
    nowhere is it actually making, such sacrifices to improve its position in
    this respect as in our country. 
  Too little, far too little, is still being done by us to adjust our
    state budget to satisfy, as a first measure, the requirements of elementary
    public education. Even in our People’s Commissariat of Education we
    all too often find disgracefully inflated staffs in some state publishing
    establishment, which is contrary to the concept that the state’s first
    concern should not be publishing houses but that there should be people to
    read, that the number of people able to read is greater, so that book
    publishing should have a wider political field in future Russia. Owing to
    the old (and bad) habit, we are still devoting much more time and effort to
    technical questions, such as the question of book publishing, than to the
    general political question of literacy among the people. 
  If we take the Central Vocational Education Board, we are sure that
    there, too, we shall find far too much that is superfluous and inflated by
    departmental interests, much that is ill-adjusted to the requirements of
    broad public education. Far from everything that we find in the Central
    Vocational Education Board can be justified by the legitimate desire first
    of all to improve and give a practical slant to the education of our young
    factory workers. If we examine the staff of the Central Vocational Education
    Board carefully we shall find very much that is inflated and is in that
    respect fictitious and should be done away with. There is still very much in
    the proletarian and peasant state that can and must be economised for the
    purpose of promoting literacy among the people; this can be done by closing
    institutions which are playthings of a semi-aristocratic type, or
    institutions we can still do without and will be able to do without, and
    shall have to do without, for a long time to come, considering the state of
    literacy among the people as revealed by the statistics. 
  Our schoolteacher should be raised to a standard he has never achieved,
    and cannot achieve, in bourgeois society. This is a truism and requires no
    proof. We must strive for this state of affairs by working steadily,
    methodically and persistently to raise the teacher to a higher cultural
    level, to train him thoroughly for his really high calling and—mainly,
    mainly and mainly—to improve his position materially. 
  We must systematically step up our efforts to organise the
    schoolteachers so as to transform them from the bulwark of the bourgeois
    system that they still are in all capitalist countries without exception,
    into the bulwark of the Soviet system, in order, through their agency, to
    divert the peasantry from alliance with the bourgeoisie and to bring them
    into alliance with the proletariat. 
  I want briefly to emphasise the special importance in this respect of
    regular visits to the villages; such visits, it is true, are already being
    practised and should be regularly promoted. We should not stint
    money—which we all too often waste on the machinery of state that is
    almost entirely a product of the past historical epoch—on measures
    like these visits to the villages. 
  For the speech I was to have delivered at the Congress of Soviets in
    December 1922 I collected data on the patronage undertaken by urban workers
    over villagers. Part of these data was obtained for me by Comrade
    Khodorovsky, and since I have been unable to deal with this problem and give
    it publicity through the Congress, I submit the matter to the comrades for
    discussion now. 
  Here we have a fundamental political question—the relations
    between town and country—which is of decisive importance for the whole
    of our revolution. While the bourgeois state methodically concentrates all
    its efforts on doping the urban workers, adapting all the literature
    published at state expense and at the expense of the tsarist and bourgeois
    parties for this purpose, we can and must utilise our political power to
    make the urban worker an effective vehicle of communist ideas among the
    rural proletariat. 
  I said "communist", but I hasten to make a reservation for fear of
    causing a misunderstanding, or of being taken too literally. Under no
    circumstances must this be understood to mean that we should immediately
    propagate purely and strictly communist ideas in the countryside. As long as
    our countryside lacks the material basis for communism, it will be, I should
    say, harmful, in fact, I should say, fatal, for communism to do so. 
  That is a fact. We must start by establishing contacts between town and
    country without the preconceived aim of implanting communism in the rural
    districts. It is an aim which cannot be achieved at the present time. It is
    inopportune, and to set an aim like that at the present time would be
    harmful, instead of useful, to the cause. 
  But it is our duty to establish contacts between the urban workers and
    the rural working people, to establish between them a form of comradeship
    which can easily be created. This is one of the fundamental tasks of the
    working class which holds power. To achieve this we must form a number of
    associations (Party, trade union and private) of factory workers, which
    would devote themselves regularly to assisting the villages in their
    cultural development. 
  Is it possible to "attach" all the urban groups to all the village
    groups, so that every working-class group may take advantage regularly of
    every opportunity, of every occasion to serve the cultural needs of the
    village group it is "attached" to? Or will it be possible to find other
    forms of contact? I here confine myself solely to formulating the question
    in order to draw the comrades’ attention to it, to point out the
    available experience of Western Siberia (to which Comrade Khodorovsky drew
    my attention) and to present this gigantic, historic cultural task in all
    its magnitude. 
  We are doing almost nothing for the rural districts outside our
    official budget or outside official channels. True, in our country the
    nature of the cultural relations between town and village is automatically
    and inevitably changing. Under capitalism the town introduced political,
    economic, moral, physical, etc., corruption into the countryside. In our
    case, towns are automatically beginning to introduce the very opposite of
    this into the countryside. But, I repeat, all this is going on
    automatically, spontaneously, and can be improved (and later increased a
    hundredfold) by doing it consciously, methodically and systematically. 
  We shall begin to advance (and shall then surely advance a hundred
    times more quickly) only after we have studied the question, after we have
    formed all sorts of workers’ organisations—doing everything to
    prevent them from becoming bureaucratic—to take up the matter, discuss
    it and get things done.

On Cooperation

It seems to me that not enough attention is being paid to the
 cooperative movement in our country. Not everyone understands that now,
 since the time of the October revolution and quite apart from NEP (on the contrary,
 in this connection we must say—because of NEP), our cooperative
 movement has become one of great significance. There is a lot of fantasy in
 the dreams of the old cooperators. Often they are ridiculously fantastic.
 But why are they fantastic? Because people do not understand the
 fundamental, the rock-bottom significance of the working-class political
 struggle for the overthrow of the rule of the exploiters. We have
 overthrown the rule of the exploiters, and much that was fantastic, even
 romantic, even banal in the dreams of the old cooperators is now becoming
 unvarnished reality.
Indeed, since political power is in the hands of the working-class,
 since this political power owns all the means of production, the only task,
 indeed, that remains for us is to organize the population in cooperative
 societies. With most of the population organizing cooperatives, the
 socialism which in the past was legitimately treated with ridicule, scorn
 and contempt by those who were rightly convinced that it was necessary to
 wage the class struggle, the struggle for political power, etc., will
 achieve its aim automatically. But not all comrades realize how vastly, how
 infinitely important it is now to organize the population of Russia in
 cooperative societies. By adopting NEP we made a concession to the peasant
 as a trader, to the principal of private trade; it is precisely for this
 reason (contrary to what some people think) that the cooperative movement
 is of such immense importance. All we actually need under NEP is to
 organize the population of Russia in cooperative societies on a
 sufficiently large-scale, for we have now found the degree of combination
 of private interest, of private commercial interest, with state supervision
 and control of this interest, that degree of its subordination to the
 common interests which was formerly the stumbling block for very many
 socialists. Indeed, the power of the state over all large-scale means of
 production, political power in the hands of the proletariat, the alliance
 of this proletariat with the many millions of small and very small
 peasants, the assured proletarian leadership of the peasantry, etc. —
 is this not all that is necessary to build a complete socialist society out
 of cooperatives, out of cooperatives alone, which we formerly ridiculed as
 huckstering and which from a certain aspect we have the right to treat as
 such now, under NEP? Is this not all that is necessary to build a complete
 socialist society? It is still not the building of socialist society, but
 it is all that is necessary and sufficient for it.
It is this very circumstance that is underestimated by many of our
 practical workers. They look down upon cooperative societies, failing to
 appreciate their exceptional importance, first, from the standpoint of
 principal (the means of production are owned by the state), and, second,
 from the standpoint of transition to the new system by means that are the
 simplest, easiest and most acceptable to the peasant.
But this again is a fundamental importance. It is one thing to draw out
 fantastic plans for building socialism through all sorts of workers
 associations, and quite another to learn to build socialism in practice in
 such a way that every small peasant could take part in it. That is
 the very stage we have now reached. And there is no doubt that, having
 reached it, we are taking too little advantage of it.
We went too far when we reintroduced NEP, but not because we attached
 too much importance to the principal of free enterprise and trade —
 we want too far because we lost sight of the cooperatives, because we now
 underrate cooperatives, because we are already beginning to forget the vast
 importance of the cooperatives from the above two points of view.
I now propose to discuss with the reader what can and must at once be
 done practically on the basis of this “cooperative” principle. By what
 means can we, and must we, start at once to develop this “cooperative"
 principle so that its socialist meaning may be clear to all?
Cooperation must be politically so organized that it will not only
 generally and always enjoy certain privileges, but that these privileges
 should be of a purely material nature (a favorable bank rate, etc.). The
 cooperatives must be granted state loans that are greater, if only by a
 little, than the loans we grant to private enterprises, even to heavy
 industry, etc.
A social system emerges only if it has the financial backing of a
 definite class. There is no need to mention the hundreds of millions of
 rubles that the birth of “free” capitalism cost. At present we have to
 realize that the cooperatives system is a social system we must now give
 more than ordinary assistance, and we must actually give that assistance.
 But it must be it assistance in the real sense of the word, i.e., it will
 not be enough to interpret it to mean assistance for any kind of
 cooperative trade; by assistance we must mean aid to cooperative trade in
 which really large masses of the population actually take part. It
 is certainly a correct form of assistance to give a bonus to peasants who
 take part in cooperative trade; but the whole point is to verify the nature
 of this participation, to verify the awareness behind it, and to verify its
 quality. Strictly speaking, when a cooperator goes to a village and opens
 cooperative store, the people take no part in this whenever; but at the
 same time guided by their own interests they will hasten to try to take
 part in it.
There is another aspect this question. From the point of view of the
 “enlightened” European there is not much left for us to do to induce
 absolutely everyone to take not a passive, but inactive part in cooperative
 operations. Strictly speaking, there is “only” one thing we have
 left to do and that is to make our people so “enlightened” that they
 understand all the advantages of everybody participating in the work of the
 cooperatives, and organizes participation. “only” the fact. There
 are now no other devices needed to advance to socialism. But to achieve
 this “only", there must be a veritable revolution—the entire people
 must go through a period of cultural development. Therefore, our rule must
 be: as little philosophizing and as few acrobatics as possible. In this
 respect NEP is an advance, because it is adjustable to the level of the
 most ordinary peasant and does not demand anything higher of him. But it
 will take a whole historical epoch to get the entire population into the
 work of the cooperatives through NEP. At best we can achieve this in one or
 two decades. Nevertheless, it will be a distinct historical epoch, and
 without this historical epoch, without universal literacy, without a proper
 degree of efficiency, without training the population sufficiently to
 acquire the habit of book reading, and without the material basis for this,
 without a certain sufficiency to safeguard against, say, bad harvests,
 famine, etc.—without this we shall not achieve our object. The
 thing now is to learn to combine the wide revolutionary range of action,
 the revolutionary enthusiasm which we have displayed, and displayed
 abundantly, and crowned with complete success—to learn to combine
 this with (I'm almost inclined to say) the ability to be an efficient and
 capable trader, which is quite enough to be a good cooperator. By ability
 to be a trader I mean the ability to be a cultured trader. Let those
 Russians, or peasants, who imagine that since they trade they are good
 traders, get that well into their heads. This does not follow that all.
 They do trade, but that is far from being cultured traders. They now trade
 in an Asiatic manner, but to be a good trader one must trade in the
 European manner. They are a whole epoch behind in that.
In conclusion: a number of economic, financial and banking privileges
 must be granted to the cooperatives—this is the way our socialist
 state must promote the new principle on which the population must be
 organized. But this is only the general outline of the task; it does not
 define and depict in detail the entire content of the practical task, i.e.,
 we must find what form of “bonus” to give for joining the cooperatives (and
 the terms on which we should give it), the form of bonus by which we shall
 assist the cooperative sufficiently, the form of bonus that will produce
 the civilized cooperator. And given social ownership of the means of
 production, given the class victory of the proletariat over the
 bourgeoisie, the system of civilized cooperators is the system of
 socialism.

II
Whenever I wrote about the New Economic Policy I always quoted the
 article on state capitalism which I wrote in 1918 ["Left-Wing” Childishness and the Petty-Bourgeois Mentality;
 part III]. This has more than once aroused doubts in the minds of
 certain young comrades but their doubts were mainly on abstract political
 points.
It seemed to them that the term “state capitalism” could not be applied
 to a system under which the means of production were owned by the
 working-class, a working-class that held political power. They did not
 notice, however, that I use the term “state capitalism", firstly,
 to connect historically our present position with the position adopted in
 my controversy with the so-called Left Communists; also, I argued at the
 time that state capitalism would be superior to our existing economy. It
 was important for me to show the continuity between ordinary state
 capitalism and the unusual, even very unusual, state capitalism to which I
 referred in introducing the reader to the New Economic Policy.
 Secondly, the practical purpose was always important to me. And
 the practical purpose of our New Economic Policy was to lease out
 concessions. In the prevailing circumstances, concessions in our country
 would unquestionably have been a pure type of state capitalism. That is how
 I argued about state capitalism.
But there is another aspect of the matter for which we may need state
 capitalism, or at least a comparison with it. It is a question of
 cooperatives.
In the capitalist state, cooperatives are no doubt collective capitalist
 institutions. Nor is there any doubt that under our present economic
 conditions, when we combine private capitalist enterprises—but in
 no other way than nationalized land and in no other way than under the
 control of the working-class state—with enterprises of the
 consistently socialist type (the means of production, the land on which the
 enterprises are situated, and the enterprises as a whole belonging to the
 state), the question arises about a third type of enterprise, the
 cooperatives, which were not formally regarded as an independent type
 differing fundamentally from the others. Under private capitalism,
 cooperative enterprises differ from capitalist enterprises as collective
 enterprises differ from private enterprises. Under state capitalism,
 cooperative enterprises differ from state capitalist enterprises, firstly,
 because they are private enterprises, and, secondly, because they are
 collective enterprises. Under our present system, cooperative enterprises
 differ from private capitalist enterprises because they are collective
 enterprises, but do not differ from socialist enterprises if the land on
 which they are situated and means of production belong to the state, i.e.,
 the working-class.
This circumstance is not considered sufficiently when cooperatives are
 discussed. It is forgotten that owing to the special features of our
 political system, our cooperatives acquire an altogether exceptional
 significance. If we exclude concessions, which, incidentally, have not
 developed on any considerable scale, cooperation under our conditions
 nearly always coincides fully with socialism.
Let me explain what I mean. Why were the plans of the old cooperators,
 from Robert Owen onwards, fantastic? Because they dreamed of peacefully
 remodeling contemporary society into socialism without taking account of
 such fundamental questions as the class struggle, the capture of political
 power by the working-class, the overthrow of the rule of the exploiting
 class. That is why we are right in regarding as entirely fantastic this
 “cooperative” socialism, and as romantic, and even banal, the dream of
 transforming class enemies into class collaborators and class war into
 class peace (so-called class truce) by merely organizing the population in
 cooperative societies.
Undoubtedly we were right from the point of view of the fundamental task
 of the present day, for socialism cannot be established without a class
 struggle for the political power and a state.
But see how things have changed now that the political power is in the
 hands of the working-class, now that the political power of the exploiters
 is overthrown and all the means of production (except those which the
 workers' state voluntarily abandons on specified terms and for a certain
 time to the exploiters in the form of concessions) are owned by the
 working-class.
Now we are entitled to say that for us the mere growth of cooperation
 (with the “slight” exception mentioned above) is identical with the growth  of socialism, and at the same time we have to admit that there has been a radical modification in our whole outlook on socialism. The radical modification is this; formerly we placed, and had to place, the main emphasis on the political struggle, on revolution, on winning political power, etc. Now the emphasis is changing and shifting to peaceful, organizational, “cultural” work. I should say that emphasis is shifting to educational work, were it not for our international relations, were it not for the fact that we have to fight for our position on a worldscale. If we leave that aside, however, and confine ourselves to internal economic relations, the emphasis in our work is certainly shifting to education.
Two main tasks confront us, which constitute the epoch—to
 reorganize our machinery of state, which is utterly useless, in which we
 took over in its entirety from the preceding epoch; during the past five
 years of struggle we did not, and could not, drastically reorganize it. Our second task is educational work among the peasants. And the economic object of this educational work among the peasants is to organize the latter in cooperative societies. If the whole of the peasantry had been organized in cooperatives, we would by now have been standing with both feet on the soil of socialism. But the organization of the entire peasantry in cooperative societies presupposes a standard of culture, and the peasants (precisely among the peasants as the overwhelming mass) that cannot, in fact, be achieved without a cultural revolution.
Our opponents told us repeatedly that we were rash in undertaking to
 implant socialism in an insufficiently cultured country. But they were
 misled by our having started from the opposite end to that prescribed by theory (the theory of pedants of all kinds), because in our country the
 political and social revolution preceded the cultural revolution, that very cultural revolution which nevertheless now confronts us.
This cultural revolution would now suffice to make our country a
 completely socialist country; but it presents immense difficulties of a
 purely cultural (for we are illiterate) and material character (for to be cultured we must achieve a certain development of the material means of
 production, we must have a certain material base).

      Note that corrections were later appended to this document,
      written in the margins of the stenographer's notes.

    

 

      I have lately been glancing through Sukhanov's notes on the
      revolution.  What strikes one most is the pedantry of all our
      petty-bourgeois Democrats and of all heroes of the Second
      International.  Apart from the fact that they are all extremely
      fainthearted, that when it comes to the minutest deviation from
      the German model [of Socialism] even
      the best of them fortified themselves with reservations —
      apart from this characteristic, which is common to all
      petty-bourgeois Democrats and has been abundantly manifested by
      them throughout the revolution, what strikes one is their
      slavish imitation of the past.

    

      They all call themselves Marxists, but their conception of
      Marxism is impossibly pedantic.  They have completely failed to
      understand what is decisive in Marxism, namely, its
      revolutionary dialectics.  They have even absolutely failed to
      understand Marx's plain statements that in times of revolution
      the utmost flexibility is demanded,[A] and have even failed to
      notice, for instance, the statements Marx made in his letters
      — I think it was in 1856 — expressing the hope of
      combining the peasant war in Germany, which might create a
      revolutionary situation, with the working-class movement[B] — they
      avoid even this plain statement and walk around and about it
      like a cat around a bowl of hot porridge.

    

      Their conduct betrays them as cowardly reformists
      who are afraid to deviate from the bourgeoisie, let alone break
      with it, at the same time they disguised their cowardice with
      the wildest rhetoric and braggartry.  But what strikes one in
      all of them even from the purely theoretical point of view is
      their utter inability to grasp the following Marxist
      considerations: up to now they have seen capitalism and
      bourgeois democracy in Western Europe follow a definite path of
      development, and cannot conceive that this path can be taken as
      a model only mutatis mutandis, only with certain
      amendments (quite insignificant from the standpoint of the
      general development of world history).

    

First — the revolution connected with the first
      imperialist world war.  Such revolution was bound to reveal new
      features, or variations, resulting from the war itself, the
      world has never seen such a war in such a situation.  We find
      that since the war the bourgeoisie of the wealthiest countries
      have to this day been unable to restore "normal" bourgeois
      relations.  Yet our reformists — petty-bourgeois who make a
      show of being revolutionaries — believed, and still
      believe, that normal bourgeois relations are the limit (thus far
      shalt thou go and no farther).  And even their conception of
      "normal" is extremely stereotyped and narrow.

    

Secondly, they are complete strangers to the idea that
      while the development of world history as a whole follows
      general laws it is by no means precluded, but, on the contrary,
      presumed, that certain periods of development may display
      peculiarities in either the form or the sequence of this
      development.  For instance, it has not even occurred to them
      that because Russia stands on the borderline between civilized
      countries and the countries which this war has for the first
      time definitely brought into the orbit of civilization —
      all the Oriental, non-European countries — she could and
      was, indeed, bound to reveal certain distinguishing features;
      although these, of course, are in keeping with the general line
      of world development, they distinguish her revolution from those
      which took place in the West European countries and introduce
      certain partial innovations as the revolution moves on to the
      countries of the East.

    

      Infinitely stereotyped, for instance, is the argument they
      learned by rote during the development of West-European
      Social-Democracy, namely, that we are not yet ripe for
      socialism, but as certain "learned" gentleman among them put it,
      the objective economic premises for socialism do not exist in
      our country.  Does it not occur to any of them to ask: what
      about the people that found itself in a revolutionary situation
      such as that created during the first imperialist war?  Might it
      not, influenced by the hopelessness of its situation, fling
      itself into a struggle that would offer it at least some chance
      of securing conditions for the further development of
      civilization that were somewhat unusual?

    

      "The development of the productive forces of Russia has not yet
      attained the level that makes socialism possible."  All the
      heroes of the Second International, including, of course,
      Sukhanov, beat the drums about this proposition.  They keep
      harping on this incontrovertible proposition in a thousand
      different keys, and think that it is decisive criterion of our
      revolution.

    

      But what if the situation, which drew Russia into the
      imperialist world war that involved every more or less
      influential West European country and made her a witness of the
      eve of the revolutions maturing or partly already begun in the
      East, gave rise to circumstances that put Russia and her
      development in a position which enabled us to achieve precisely
      that combination of a "peasant war" with the working-class
      movement suggested in 1856 by no less a Marxist than Marx
      himself as a possible prospect for Prussia?

    

      What if the complete hopelessness of the situation, by
      stimulating the efforts of the workers and peasants tenfold,
      offered us the opportunity to create the fundamental requisites
      of civilization in a different way from that of the West
      European countries?  Has that altered the general line of
      development of world history?  Has that altered the basic
      relations between the basic classes of all the countries that
      are being, or have been, drawn into the general course of world
      history?

    

      If a definite level of culture is required for the building of
      socialism (although nobody can say just what that definite
      "level of culture" is, for it differs in every Western European
      country), why cannot we began by first achieving the
      prerequisites for that definite level of culture in a
      revolutionary way, and then, with the aid of the
      workers' and peasants' government and Soviet system, proceed to
      overtake the other nations?

    

      January 16, 1923

    


      II
    

      You say that civilization is necessary for the building of
      socialism.  Very good.  But why could we not first create such
      prerequisites of civilization in our country by the expulsion of
      the landowners and the Russian capitalists, and then start
      moving toward socialism?  Where, in what books, have you read
      that such variations of the customary historical sequence of
      events are impermissible or impossible?

    

      Napoleon, I think, wrote: "On s'engage et puis ... on
      voit." rendered freely this means: "First engage in a
      serious battle and then see what happens."  Well, we did first
      engage in a serious battle in October 1917, and then saw such
      details of development (from the standpoint of world history
      they were certainly details) as the Brest peace, the New
      Economic Policy, and so forth.  And now there can be no doubt
      that in the main we have been victorious.

    

      Our Sukhanovs, not to mention Social-Democrats still farther to
      the right, never even dream that revolutions cannot be made any
      other way.  Our European philistines never even dream that the
      subsequent revolutions in Oriental countries, which possess much
      vaster populations in a much vaster diversity of social
      conditions, will undoubtedly display even greater distinctions
      than the Russian Revolution.

    

      It need hardly be said that a textbook written on Kautskian
      lines was a very useful thing in its day.  But it is time, given
      that, to abandon the idea that it foresaw all the forms of
      development of subsequent world history.  It would be timely to
      say that those who think so are simply fools.

How We Should Reorganise the Wokers' and Peasants' Inspection

It is beyond question that the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection is an enormous difficulty for us, and that so far this difficulty has not been overcome. I think that the comrades who try to overcome the difficulty by denying that the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection is useful and necessary are wrong. But I do not deny that the problem presented by our state apparatus and the task of improving it is very difficult, that it is far from being solved, and is an extremely urgent one.


With the exception of the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, our state apparatus is to a considerable extent a survival of the past and has undergone hardly any serious change. It has only been slightly touched up on the surface, but in all other respects it is a most typical relic of our old state machine. And so, to find a method of really renovating it, I think we ought to turn for experience to our Civil War.


How did we act in the more critical moment of the Civil War?


We concentrated our best Party forces in the Red Army; we mobilised the best of our workers; we looked for new forces at the deepest roots of our dictatorship.


I am convinced that we must go to the same source to find the means of reorganising the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection. I recommend that our Twelfth Party Congress adopt the following plan of reorganisation, based on some enlargement of our Central Control Commission.


The Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee of our Party are already revealing a tendency to develop into a kind of supreme Party conference. They take place, on the average, not more than once in two months, while the routine work is conducted, as we know, on behalf of the Central Committee by our Political Bureau, our Organising Bureau, our Secretariat, and so forth. I think we ought to follow the road we have thus taken to the end and definitely transform the Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee into supreme Party conferences convened once in two months jointly with the Central Control Commission. 


The Central Control Commission should be combined with the main body of the reorganised Workers' and Peasants' Inspection along the following lines:


I propose that the Congress should elect 75 to 100 new members to the Central Control Commission. They should be workers and peasants, and should go through the same Party screening as ordinary members of the Central Committee, because they are to enjoy the same rights as the members of the Central Committee.


On the other hand, the staff of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection should be reduced to three or four hundred persons, specially screened for conscientiousness and knowledge of our state apparatus. They must also undergo a special test as regards their knowledge of the principles of scientific organisation of labour in general, and of administrative work, office work, and so forth, in particular.


In my opinion, such a union of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection with the Central Control Commission will be beneficial to both these institutions. On the one hand, the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection will thus obtain such high authority that it will certainly not be inferior to the People's Commissariat of Foreign Affairs. On the other hand, our Central Committee, together with the Central Control Commission, will definitely take the road of becoming a supreme Party conference, which in fact it has already taken, and along which it should proceed to the end so as to be able to fulfil its functions properly in two respects: in respect to its own methodical, expedient and systematic organisation of work, and in respect to maintaining contacts with the broad masses through the medium of the best of our workers and peasants.


I foresee an objection that, directly or indirectly, may come from those spheres which make our state apparatus antiquated, i.e., from those who urge that its present, utterly impossible, indecently pre-revolutionary form be preserved (incidentally, we now have an opportunity which rarely occurs in history of ascertaining the period necessary for bringing about radical social changes; we now see clearly what can be done in five years, and what requires much more time). The objection I foresee is that the change I propose will lead to nothing but chaos. The members of the Central Control Commission will wander around all the institutions, not knowing where, why or to whom to apply, causing disorganisation everywhere and distracting employees from their routine work, etc., etc.


I think that the malicious source of this objection is so obvious that it does not warrant a reply. It goes without saying that the Presidium of the Central Control Commission, the People's Commissar of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection and his collegium (and also, in the proper cases, the Secretariat of our Central Committee) will have to put in years of persistent effort to get the Commissariat properly organised, and to get it to function smoothly in conjunction with the Central Control Commission. In my opinion, the People's Commissar of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection, as well as the whole collegium, can (and should) remain and guide the work of the entire Workers' and Peasants' Inspection, including the work of all the members of the Central Control Commission who will be "placed under his command". The three or four hundred employees of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection that are to remain, according to my plan, should, on the one hand, perform purely secretarial functions for the other members of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection and for the supplementary members of the Central Control Commission; and, on the other hand, they should be highly skilled, specially screened, particularly reliable, and highly paid, so that they may be relieved of their present truly unhappy (to say the least) position of Workers' and Peasants' Inspection officials.


I am sure that the reduction of the staff to the number I have indicated will greatly enhance the efficiency of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection personnel and the quality of all its work, enabling the People's Commissar and the members of the collegium to concentrate their efforts entirely on organising work and on systematically and steadily improving its efficiency, which is so absolutely essential for our workers' and peasants' government, and for our Soviet system.


On the other hand, I also think that the People's Commissar of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection should work partly combining and partly co-ordinating those higher institutions for the organisation of labour (the Central Institute of Labour, etc.), of which there are now no fewer than twelve in our Republic. Excessive uniformity and a consequent desire to unity will be harmful. On the contrary, what is needed here is a reasonable and expedient mean between combining all these institutions and properly delimiting them, allowing for a certain independence in each of them.


Our own Central Committee will undoubtedly gain no less from this reorganisation than the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection. It will gain because its contacts with the masses will be greater and because the regularity and effectiveness of its work will improve. It will then be possible (and necessary) to institute a stricter and more responsible procedure of preparing for the meetings of the Political Bureau, which should be attended by a definite number of members of the Central Control Commission determined either from a definite period of by some organisation plan.


In distributing work to the members of the Central Control Commission, the People's Commissar of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection, in conjunction with the Presidium of the Central Control Commission, should impose on them the duty either of attending the meetings of the Political Bureau for the purpose of examining all the documents pertaining to matters that come before it in one way or another; or of devoting their working time to theoretical study, to the study of scientific methods of organising labour; or of taking a practical part in the work of supervising and improving our machinery of state, from the higher state institutions to the lower local bodies, etc.


I also think that in addition to the political advantages ocurring from the fact that the members of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission will, as a consequence of this reform, be much better informed and better prepared for the meetings of the Political Bureau (all the documents relevant to the business to be discussed at these meetings should be sent to all the members of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission not latter than the day before the meeting of the Political Bureau, except in absolutely urgent cases, for which special methods of informing the members of the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission and of settling these matters must be devise), their will also be the advantage that the influence of purely personal and incidental factors in our Central Committee will diminish, and this will reduce the danger of a split.


Our Central Committee has grown into a strictly centralised and highly authoritative group, but the conditions under which this group is working are not concurrent with its authority. The reform I recommend should help to remove this defect, and the members of the Central Control Commission, whose duty it will be to attend all meetings of the Political Bureau in a definite number, will have to form a compact group which should not allow anybody's authority without exception, neither that of the General Secretary [Stalin] nor of any other member of the Central Committee, to prevent them from putting questions, verifying documents, and, in general, from keeping themselves fully informed of all things and from exercising the strictest control over the proper conduct of affairs.


Of course, in our Soviet Republic, the social order is based on the collaboration of two classes: the workers and peasants, in which the "Nepmen", i.e., the bourgeoisie, are now permitted to participate on certain terms. If serious class disagreements arise between these classes, a split will be inevitable. But the grounds for such a split are not inevitable in our social system, and it is the principal tasks of our Central Committee and Central Control Commission, as well as of our party as a whole, to watch very closely over such circumstances as may cause a split, and to forestall them, for in the final analysis the fate of our Republic will depend on whether the peasant masses will stand by the working class, loyal to their alliance, or whether they will permit the "Nepmen", i.e., the new bourgeoisie, to drive a wedge between them and the working class, to split them off from the working class. The more clearly we see this alternative, the more clearly all our workers and peasants understand it, the greater are the chances that we shall avoid a split which would be fatal for the Soviet Republic.

This document is the second part of Lenin’s letter to the
    12th Congress How we Should Reorganise the Workers’
    and Peasants’ Inspection. This is the last document written by Vladimir
    Lenin.

In the matter of improving our state apparatus, the Workers’ and
    Peasants’ Inspection should not, in my opinion, either strive after
    quantity or hurry. We have so far been able to devote so little thought and
    attention to the efficiency of our state apparatus that it would now be
    quite legitimate if we took special care to secure its thorough
    organisation, and concentrated in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection a
    staff of workers really abreast of the times, i.e., not inferior to the
    best West-European standards. For a socialist republic this condition is,
    of course, too modest. But our experience of the first five years has
    fairly crammed our heads with mistrust and scepticism. These qualities
    assert themselves involuntarily when, for example, we hear people dilating
    at too great length and too flippantly on "proletarian" culture. For a
    start, we should be satisfied with real bourgeois culture; for a start we
    should be glad to dispense with the crude types of pre-bourgeois culture,
    i.e., bureaucratic culture or serf culture, etc. In matters of culture,
    haste and sweeping measures are most harmful. Many of our young writers and
    Communists should get this well into their heads.
Thus, in the matter of our state apparatus we should now draw the
    conclusion from our past experience that it would be better to proceed more
    slowly.
Our state apparatus is so deplorable, not to say wretched, that we must
    first think very carefully how to combat its defects, bearing in mind that
    these defects are rooted in the past, which, although it has been
    overthrown, has not yet been overcome, has not yet reached the stage of a
    culture, that has receded into the distant past. I say culture
    deliberately, because in these matters we can only regard as achieved what
    has become part and parcel of our culture, of our social life, our habits.
    We might say that the good in our social system has not been properly
    studied, understood, and taken to heart; it has been hastily grasped at; it
    has not been verified or tested, corroborated by experience, and not made
    durable, etc. Of course, it could not be otherwise in a revolutionary
    epoch, when development proceeded at such break-neck speed that in a matter
    of five years we passed from tsarism to the Soviet system.
It is time we did something about it. We must show sound scepticism for
    too rapid progress, for boastfulness, etc. We must give thought to testing
    the steps forward we proclaim every hour, take every minute and then prove
    every second that they are flimsy, superficial and misunderstood. The most
    harmful thing here would be haste. The most harmful thing would be to rely
    on the assumption that we know at least something, or that we have any
    considerable number of elements necessary for the building of a really new
    state apparatus, one really worthy to be called socialist, Soviet, etc.
No, we are ridiculously deficient of such an apparatus, and even of the
    elements of it, and we must remember that we should not stint time on
    building it, and that it will take many, many years.
What elements have we for building this apparatus? Only two. First, the
    workers who are absorbed in the struggle of socialism. These elements are
    not sufficient educated. They would like to build a better apparatus for
    us, but they do not know how. They cannot build one. They have not yet
    developed the culture required for this; and it is culture that is
    required. Nothing will be achieved in this by doing things in a rush, by
    assault, by vim or vigour, or in general, by any of the best human
    qualities. Secondly, we have elements of knowledge, education and training,
    but they are ridiculously inadequate compared with all other countries.
Here we must not forget that we are too prone to compensate (or imagine
    that we can compensate) our lack of knowledge by zeal, haste, etc.
In order to renovate our state apparatus we must at all costs set out,
    first, to learn, secondly, to learn, and thirdly, to learn, and then see to
    it that learning shall not remain a dead letter, or a fashionable
    catch-phrase (and we should admit in all frankness that this happens very
    often with us), that learning shall really become part of our very being,
    that it shall actually and fully become a constituent element of our social
    life. In short, we must not make the demands that were made by bourgeois
    Western Europe, but demands that are fit and proper for a country which has
    set out to develop into a socialist country.
The conclusion to be drawn from the above are the following: we must
    make the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection a really exemplary institution,
    an instrument to improve our state apparatus.
In order that it may attain the desired high level, we must follow the
    rule: "Measure your cloth seven times before you cut."
For this purpose, we must utilise the very best of what there is in our
    social system, and utilise it with the greatest caution, thoughtfulness and
    knowledge, to build up the new People’s Commissariat.
For this purpose, the best elements that we have in our social system-
    such as, first, the advanced workers, and, second, the really enlightened
    elements for whom we can vouch that they will not take the word for the
    deed, and will not utter a single word that goes against their conscience-
    should not shrink from admitting any difficulty and should not shrink from
    any struggle in order to achieve the object they have seriously set
    themselves.
We have been bustling for five years trying to improve our state
    apparatus, but it has been mere bustle, which has proved useless in these
    five years, of even futile, or even harmful. This bustle created the
    impression that we were doing something, but in effect it was only clogging
    up our institutions and our brains.
It is high time things were changed.
We must follow the rule: Better fewer, but better. We must follow the
    rule: Better get good human material in two or even three years than work
    in haste without hope of getting any at all.
I know that it will be hard to keep to this rule and apply it under our
    conditions. I know that the opposite rule will force its way through a
    thousand loopholes. I know that enormous resistance will have to be put up,
    that devilish persistence will be required, that in the first few years at
    least work in this field will be hellishly hard. Nevertheless, I am
    convinced that only by such effort shall we be able to achieve our aim; and
    that only by achieving this aim shall we create a republic that is really
    worthy of the name of Soviet, socialist, and so on, and so forth.
Many readers probably thought that the figures I quoted by way of
    illustration in my first article [ How We Should
    Reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection] were too small. I am
    sure that many calculations may be made to prove that they are. But I think
    that we must put one thing above all such and other calculations, i.e., our
    desire to obtain really exemplary quality.
I think that the time has at last come when we must work in real earnest
    to improve our state apparatus and in this there can scarcely be anything
    more harmful than haste. That is why I would sound a strong warning against
    inflating the figures. In my opinion, we should, on the contrary, be
    especially sparing with figures in this matter. Let us say frankly that the
    People’ s Commissariat of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection does not at
    present enjoy the slightest authority. Everybody knows that no other
    institutions are worse organised than those of our Workers’ and Peasants’
    Inspection, and that under present conditions nothing can be expected from
    this People’s Commissariat. We must have this firmly fixed in our minds if
    we really want to create within a few years an institution that will,
    first, be an exemplary institution, secondly, win everybody’s absolute
    confidence, and, thirdly, prove to all and sundry that we have really
    justified the work of such a highly placed institution as the Central
    Control Commission. In my opinion, we must immediately and irrevocably
    reject all general figures for the size of office staffs. We must select
    employees for the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection with particular care
    and only on the basis of the strictest test. Indeed, what is the use of
    establishing a People’s Commissariat which carries on anyhow, which does
    not enjoy the slightest confidence, and whose word carries scarcely any
    weight? I think that our main object in launching the work of
    reconstruction that we now have in mind is to avoid all this.
The workers whom we are enlisting as members of the Central Control
    Commission must be irreproachable Communists, and I think that a great deal
    has yet to be done to teach them the methods and objects of their work.
    Furthermore, there must be a definite number of secretaries to assist in
    this work, who must be put to a triple test before they are appointed to
    their posts. Lastly, the officials whom in exceptional cases we shall
    accept directly as employees of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection must
    conform to the following requirements:
First, they must be recommended by several
    Communists.
Second, they must pass a test for knowledge of our state
    apparatus.
Third, they must pass a test in the fundamentals of the
    theory of our state apparatus, in the fundamentals of management, office
    routine, etc.
Fourth, they must work in such close harmony with the
    members of the Central Control Commission and with their own secretariat
    that we could vouch for the work of the whole apparatus.
I know that these requirements are extraordinarily strict, and I am very
    much afraid that the majority of the "practical" workers in the Workers’
    and Peasants’ Inspection will say that these requirements are
    impracticable, or will scoff at them. But I ask any of the present chiefs
    of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, or anyone associated with that
    body, whether they can honestly tell me the practical purpose of a People’s
    Commissariat like the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection? I think this
    question will help them recover their sense of proportion. Either it is not
    worth while having another of the numerous reorganisations that we have had
    of this hopeless affair, the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, or we must
    really set to work, by slow, difficult and unusual methods, and by testing
    these methods over and over again, to create something really exemplary,
    something that will win the respect of all and sundry for its merits, and
    not only because of its rank and title.
If we do not arm ourselves with patience, if we do not devote several
    years to this task, we had better not tackle it at all.
In my opinion we ought to select a minimum number of the higher labour
    research institutes, etc., which we have baked so hastily, see whether they
    are organised properly, and allow them to continue working, but only in a
    way that conforms to the high standards of modern science and gives us all
    its benefits. If we do that it will not be utopian to hope that within a
    few years we shall have an institution that will be able to perform its
    functions, to work systematically and steadily on improving our state
    apparatus, an institution backed by the trust of the working class, of the
    Russian Communist Party, and the whole population of our Republic.
The spade-work for this could begin at once. If the People’s
    Commissariat of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection accepted the present
    plan of reogranisation, it could not take the preparatory steps and work
    methodically until the task is completed, without haste, and not hesitating
    to alter what has already been done.
Any half-hearted solution would be extremely harmful in this matter. A
    measure for the size of the staff of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection
    based on any other consideration would, in fact, be based on the old
    bureaucratic considerations, on old prejudices, on what has already been
    condemned, universally ridiculed, etc.
In substance, the matter is as follows:
Either we prove now that we have really learned something
    about state organisation (we ought to have learned something in five
    years), or we prove that we are not sufficiently mature for it. If the
    latter is the case, we had better not tackle the task.
I think that with the available human material it will not be immodest
    to assume that we have learned enough to be able to systematically rebuild
    at least one People’s Commissariat. True, this one People’s Commissariat
    will have to be the model for our entire state apparatus.
We ought to at once announce a contest in the compilation of two or more
    textbooks on the organisation of labour in general, and on management in
    particular. We can take as a basis the book already published by Yermansky,
    although it should be said in parentheses that he obviously sympathises
    with Menshevism and is unfit to compile textbooks for the Soviet
    system.
We can also take as a basis the recent book by Kerzhentsev, and some of
    the other partial textbooks available may be useful too.
We ought to send several qualified and conscientious people to Germany,
    or to Britain, to collect literature and to study this question. I mention
    Britain in case it is found impossible to send people to the U.S.A. or
    Canada.
We ought to appoint a commission to draw up the preliminary programme of
    examinations for prospective employees of the Workers’ and Peasants’
    Inspection; ditto for candidates to the Central Control Commission.
These and similar measures will not, of course, cause any difficulties
    for the People’s Commissar or the collegium of the Workers’ and Peasants’
    Inspection, or for the Presidium of the Central Control Commission.
Simultaneously, a preparatory commission should be appointed to select
    candidates for membership of the Central Control Commission. I hope that we
    shall now be able to find more than enough candidates for this post among
    the experienced workers in all departments, as well as among the students
    of our Soviet higher schools. It would hardly be right to exclude one or
    another category beforehand. Probably preference will have to be given to a
    mixed composition for this institution, which should combine many
    qualities, and dissimilar merits. Consequently, the tasks of drawing up the
    list of candidates will entail a considerable amount of work. For example,
    it would be least desirable for the staff of the new People’s Commissariat
    to consist of people of one type, only of officials, say, or for it to
    exclude people of the propagandist type, or people whose principal quality
    is sociability or the ability to penetrate into circles that are not
    altogether customary for officials in this field, etc.

I think I shall be able to express my idea best if I compare my plan
    with that of academic institutions. Under the guidance of their Presidium,
    the members of the Central Control Commission should systematically examine
    all the paper and documents of the Political Bureau. Moreover, they should
    divide their time correctly between various jobs in investigating the
    routine in our institutions, form the very small and privately-owned
    offices to the highest state institutions. And lastly, their functions
    should include the study of theory, i.e., the theory of organisation of the
    work they intend to devote themselves to, and practical work under the
    guidance of other comrades or of teachers in the higher institutes for the
    organisation of labour.
I do not think, however, that they will be able to confine themselves to
    this sort of academic work. In addition, they will have to prepare
    themselves for working which I would not hesitate to call training to
    catch, I will not say rouges, but something like that, and working out
    special ruses to screen their movements, their approach, etc.
If such proposals were made in West-European government institutions
    they would rouse frightful resentment, a feeling of moral indignation,
    etc.; but I trust that we have not become so bureaucratic as to be capable
    of that. NEP has not yet succeeded in gaining such respect as to cause any
    of us to be shocked at the idea somebody may be caught. Our Soviet Republic
    is of such recent construction, and there are such heaps of the old lumber
    still lying around that it would hardly occur to anyone to be shocked at
    the idea that we should delve into them by means of ruses, by means of
    investigations sometimes directed to rather remote sources or in a
    roundabout way. And even if it did occur to anyone to be shocked by this,
    we may be sure that such a person would make himself a laughing-stock.
Let us hope that our new Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection will abandon
    what the French call pruderie, which we may call ridiculous
    primness, or ridiculous swank, and which plays entirely into the hands of
    our Soviet and Party bureaucracy. Let it be said in parentheses that we
    have bureaucrats in our Party offices as well as in Soviet offices.
When I said above that we must study and study hard in institutes for
    the higher organisation of labour, etc., I did not by any means imply
    "studying" in the schoolroom way, nor did I confine myself to the idea of
    studying only in the schoolroom way. I hope that not a single genuine
    revolutionary will suspect me of refusing, in this case, to understand
    "studies" to include resorting to some semi-humourous trick, cunning
    device, piece of trickery or something of that sort. I know that in the
    staid and earnest states of Western European such an idea would horrify
    people and that not a single decent official would even entertain it. I
    hope, however, that we have not yet become as bureaucratic as all that and
    that in our midst the discussion of this idea will give rise to nothing
    more than amusement.
Indeed, why not combine pleasure with utility? Why not resort to some
    humourous or semi-humorous trick to expose something ridiculous, something
    harmful, something semi-ridiculous, semi-harmful, etc.?
It seems to me that our Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection will gain a
    great deal if it undertakes to examine these ideas, and that the list of
    cases in which our Central Control Commission and its colleagues in the
    Workers and Peasants’ Inspection achieved a few of their most brilliant
    victories will be enriched by not a few exploits of our future Workers’ and
    Peasants’ Inspection and Central Control Commission members in places not
    quite mentionable in prim and staid textbooks.

How can a Party institution be amalgamated with a Soviet institution? Is
    there not something improper in this suggestion?
I do not ask these questions on my own behalf, but on behalf of those I
    hinted at above when I said that we have bureaucrats in our Party
    institutions as well as in the Soviet institutions.
But why, indeed, should we not amalgamate the two if this is in the
    interests of our work? Do we not all see that such an amalgamation has been
    very beneficial in the case of the People’s Commissariat of Foreign
    Affairs, where it was brought about at the very beginning? Does not the
    Political Bureau discuss from the Party point of view many questions, both
    minor and important, concerning the "moves" we should make in reply to the
    "moves" of foreign powers in order to forestall their, say, cunning, if we
    are not to use a less respectable term? Is not this flexible amalgamation
    of a Soviet institution with a Party institution a source of great strength
    in our politics? I think that what has proved its usefulness, what has been
    definitely adopted in our foreign politics and has become so customary that
    it no longer calls forth any doubt in this field, will be at least as
    appropriate (in fact, I think it will be much more appropriate) for our
    state apparatus as a whole. The functions of the Workers’ and Peasants’
    Inspection cover our state apparatus as a whole, and its activities should
    affect all and every state institution without exception: local, central ,
    commercial, purely administrative, educational, archival, theatrical, etc.-
    in short, all without any exception.
Why then should not an institution, whose activities have such wide
    scope, and which moreover requires such extraordinary flexibility of forms,
    be permitted to adopt this peculiar amalgamation of a Party control
    institution with a Soviet control institution?
I see no obstacles to this. What is more, I think that such an
    amalgamation is the only guarantee of success in our work. I think that all
    doubts on this score arise in the dustiest corners of our government
    offices, and that they deserve to be treated with nothing but ridicule.

Another doubt: is it expedient to combine educational activities with
    official activities? I think that it is not only expedient, but necessary.
    Generally speaking, in spite of our revolutionary attitude towards the
    West-European form of state, we have allowed ourselves to become infected
    with a number of its most harmful and ridiculous prejudices; to some extent
    we have been deliberately infected with them by our dear bureaucrats, who
    counted on being able again and again to fish in the muddy waters of these
    prejudices. And they did fish in these muddy waters to so great an extent
    that only the blind among us failed to see how extensively this fishing was
    practised.
In all spheres of social, economic and political relationships we are
    "frightfully" revolutionary. But as regards precedence, the observance of
    the forms and rites of office management, our "revolutionariness" often
    gives way to the mustiest routine. On more than one occasion, we have
    witnessed the very interesting phenomenon of a great leap forward in social
    life being accompanied by amazing timidity whenever the slightest changes
    are proposed.
This is natural, for the boldest steps forward were taken in a field
    which was long reserved for theoretical study, which was promoted mainly,
    and even almost exclusively, in theory. The Russian, when away from work,
    found solace from bleak bureaucratic realities in unusually bold
    theoretical constructions, and that is why in our country these unusually
    bold theoretical constructions assumed an unusually lopsided character.
    Theoretical audacity in general constructions went hand in hand with
    amazing timidity as regards certain very minor reforms in office routine.
    Some great universal agrarian revolution was worked out with an audacity
    unexampled in any other country, and at the same time the imagination
    failed when it came to working out a tenth-rate reform in office routine;
    the imagination, or patience, was lacking to apply to this reform the
    general propositions that produced such brilliant results when applied to
    general problems.
That is why in our present life reckless audacity goes hand in hand, to
    an astonishing degree, with timidity of thought even when it comes to very
    minor changes.
I think that this has happened in all really great revolutions, for
    really great revolutions grow out of the contradictions between the old,
    between what is directed towards developing the old, and the very abstract
    striving for the new, which must be so new as not to contain the tiniest
    particle of the old.
And the more abrupt the revolution, the longer will many of these
    contradictions last.

The general feature of our present life is the following: we have
    destroyed capitalist industry and have done our best to raze to the ground
    the medieval institutions and landed proprietorship, and thus created a
    small and very small peasantry, which is following the lead of the
    proletariat because it believes in the results of its revolutionary work.
    It is not easy for us, however, to keep going until the socialist
    revolution is victorious in more developed countries merely with the aid of
    this confidence, because economic necessity, especially under NEP, keeps
    the productivity of labour of the small and very small peasants at an
    extremely low level. Moreover, the international situation, too, threw
    Russia back and, by and large, reduced the labour productivity of the
    people to a level considerably below pre-war. The West-European capitalist
    powers, partly deliberately and partly unconsciously, did everything they
    could to throw us back, to utilise the elements of the Civil War in Russia
    in order to spread as much ruin in the country as possible. It was
    precisely this way out of the imperialist war that seemed to have many
    advantages. They argued somewhat as follows: "If we fail to overthrow the
    revolutionary system in Russia, we shall, at all events, hinder its
    progress towards socialism." And from their point of view they could argue
    in no other way. In the end, their problem was half-solved. They failed to
    overthrow the new system created by the revolution, but they did prevent it
    from at once taking the step forward that would have justified the
    forecasts of the socialists, that would have enabled the latter to develop
    the productive forces with enormous speed, to develop all the
    potentialities which, taken together, would have produced socialism;
    socialists would thus have proved to all and sundry that socialism contains
    within itself gigantic forces and that mankind had now entered in to a new
    stage of development of extraordinarily brilliant prospects.
The system of international relationships which has now taken shape is
    one in which a European state, Germany, is enslaved by the victor
    countries. Furthermore, owing to their victory, a number of states, the
    oldest states in the West, are in a position to make some insignificant
    concessions to their oppressed classes- concessions which, insignificant
    though they are, nevertheless heard the revolutionary movement in those
    countries and create some semblance of "class truce."
At the same time, as a result of the last imperialist war, a number of
    countries of the East, India, China, etc, have been completely jolted out
    of the rut. Their development has definitely shifted to general European
    capitalist lines. The general European ferment has begun to affect them,
    and it is now clear to the whole world that they have been drawn into a
    process of development that must lead to a crisis in the whole of world
    capitalism.
Thus, at the present time we are confronted with the question- shall we
    be able to hold on with our small and very small peasant production, and in
    our present state of ruin, until the West-European capitalist countries
    consummate their development towards socialism? But they are consummating
    it not as we formerly expected. They are not consummating it through the
    gradual "maturing" of socialism, but through the exploitation of some
    countries by others, through the exploitation of the first of the countries
    vanquished in the imperialist war combined with the exploitation of the
    whole of the East. On the other hand, precisely as a result of the first
    imperialist war, the East has been definitely drawn into the revolutionary
    movement, has been definitely drawn into the general maelstrom of the world
    revolutionary movement.
What tactics does this situation prescribe for our country? Obviously
    the following. We must display extreme caution so as to preserve our
    workers’ government and to retain our small and very small peasantry under
    its leadership and authority. We have the advantage that the whole world is
    now passing to a movement that must give rise to a world socialist
    revolution. But we are labouring under the disadvantage that the
    imperialists have succeeded in splitting the world into two camps; and this
    split is made more complicated by the fact that it is extremely difficult
    for Germany, which is really a land of advanced, cultured, capitalist
    development, to rise to her feet. All the capitalist powers of what is
    called the West are pecking at her and preventing her from rising. On the
    other hand, the entire East, with its hundred of millions of exploited
    working people, reduced to the last degree of human suffering, has been
    forced into a position where its physical and material strength cannot
    possibly be compared with the physical, material and military strength of
    any of the much smaller West-European states.
Can we save ourselves from the impending conflict with these imperialist
    countries? May we hope that the internal antagonisms and conflicts between
    the thriving imperialist countries of the East will give us a second
    respite as they did the first time, when the campaign of the West-European
    counter-revolution in support of the Russian counter-revolution broke down
    owing to the antagonisms in the camp of the counter-revolutionaries of the
    West and the East, in the camp of th Eastern and Western exploiters, in the
    camp of Japan and the U.S.A.?
I think the reply to this question should be that the issue depends upon
    too many factors, and that the outcome of the struggle as a whole can be
    forecast only because in the long run capitalism itself is educating and
    training the vast majority of the population of the globe for the
    struggle.
In the last analysis, the outcome of the struggle will be determined by
    the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., account for the overwhelming
    majority of the population of the globe. And during the past few years it
    is this majority that has been drawn into the struggle for emancipation
    with extraordinary rapidity, so that in this respect there cannot be the
    slightest doubt what the final outcome of the world struggle will be. In
    this sense, the complete victory of socialism is fully and absolutely
    assured.
But what interests us is not the inevitability of this complete victory
    of socialism, but the tactics which we, the Russian Communist Party, we the
    Russian Soviet Government, should pursue to prevent the West-European
    counter-revolutionary states form crushing us. To ensure our existence
    until the next military conflict between the counter-revolutionary
    imperialist West and the revolutionary and nationalist East, between the
    most civilised countries of the world and the Orientally backward countries
    which, however, compromise the majority, this majority must become
    civilised. We, too, lack enough civilisation to enable us to pass straight
    on to socialism, although we do have the political requisites for it. We
    should adopt the following tactics, or pursue the following policy, to save
    ourselves.
We must strive to build up a state in which the workers retain
    leadership of the peasants, in which they retain the confidence of the
    peasants, and by exercising the greatest economy remove every trace of
    extravagance from our social relations.
We must reduce our state apparatus to the utmost degree of economy. We
    must banish from it all traces of extravagance, of which so much has been
    left over from tsarist Russia, form its bureaucratic capitalist state
    machine.
Will not this be a reign of peasant limitations? 
No. If we see to it that the working class retains its leadership over
    the peasantry, we shall be able, by exercising the greatest possible thrift
    in the economic life of our state, to use every saving we make to develop
    our large-scale machine industry, to develop electrification, the hydraulic
    extraction of peat, to complete the Volkhov Power Project
[A], etc.
In this, and in this alone, lies our hope. Only when we have done this
    shall we, speaking figuratively, be able to change horses, to change from
    the peasant, muzhik horse of
    poverty, from the horse of an economy designed for a ruined peasant
    country, to the horse which the proletariat is seeking and must seek
    — the horse of large-scale machine industry, of electrification, of
    the Volkhov Power Station, etc.
That is how I link up in my mind the general plan of our work, of our
    policy, of our tactics, of our strategy, with the functions of the
    reorganised Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection. This is what, in my opinion,
    justifies the exceptional care, the exceptional attention that we must
    devote to the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection in raising it to an
    exceptionally high level, in giving it a leadership with Central Committee
    rights, etc.,etc.
And this justification is that only by thoroughly purging our government
    machine, by reducing it to the utmost everything that is not absolutely
    essential in it, shall we be certain of being able to keep going. Moreover,
    we shall be able to keep going not on the level of a small-peasant country,
    not on the level of universal limitation, but on a level steadily advancing
    to large-scale machine industry.
These are the lofty tasks that I dream of for our Workers’ and
    Peasants’
      Inspection. That is why I am planning for it the amalgamation of the most
      authoritative Party body with an "ordinary" People’s Commissariat.

[A] The Volkhov
    Power Project was the first of the big hydroelectric power stations the
    Soviet Union built on the River Volkhov. Its’ construction began in 1918,
    but made little progress until after the Civil War ended in 1920. It was
    commissioned in 1926.
