 LETTERS  AFAR
FIRST Letter
The First Stage of the First
  Revolution[1]

The first revolution engendered by the imperialist world
war has broken out. The first revolution but certainly not the last.  

Judging by the scanty information available in Switzer land, the first
stage of this first revolution, namely, of the Russian revolution
of March 1, 1917, has ended. This first stage of our revolution will
certainly not be the last.  

How could such a “miracle” have happened, that in only eight
days—the period indicated by Mr. Milyukov in his boastful telegram to all
Russia’s representatives abroad—a monarchy collapsed that had maintained
itself for centuries, and that in spite of everything had managed to
maintain itself throughout the three years of the tremendous, nation-wide
class battles of 1905–07?  

There are no miracles in nature or history, but every abrupt turn in
history, and this applies to every revolution, presents such a wealth of
content, unfolds such unexpected and specific combinations of forms of
struggle and alignment of forces of the contestants, that to the lay mind
there is much that must appear miraculous.  

The combination of a number of factors of world-historic importance was
required for the tsarist monarchy to have collapsed in a few days. We shall
mention the chief of them.  

Without the tremendous class battles and the revolutionary energy
displayed by the Russian proletariat during the three years 1905–07, the
second revolution could not possibly have been so rapid in the sense that
its initial stage was

    

completed in a few days. The first revolution (1905) deeply ploughed the
soil, uprooted age-old prejudices, awakened millions of workers and tens of
millions of peasants to political life and political struggle and revealed
to each other—and to the world—all classes (and all the
principal parties) of Russian society in their true character and in the
true alignment of their interests, their forces, their modes of action, and
their immediate and ultimate aims. This first revolution, and the
succeeding period of counter-revolution (1907–14), laid bare the very
essence of the tsarist monarchy, brought it to the “utmost limit”,
exposed all the rottenness and infamy, the cynicism and corruption of the
tsar’s clique, dominated by that monster, Rasputin. It exposed all the
bestiality of the Romanov family—those pogrom-mongers who drenched Russia
in the blood of Jews, workers and revolutionaries, those
landlords, “first among peers”, who own millions of
dessiatines of land and are prepared to stoop to any brutality, to any
crime, to ruin and strangle any number of citizens in order to preserve the
“sacred right of property” for themselves and their class.  

Without the Revolution of 1905–07 and the counter-revolution of
1907–14, there could not have been that clear “self determination” of
all classes of the Russian people and of the nations inhabiting Russia,
that determination of the relation of these classes to each other and to
the tsarist monarchy, which manifested itself during the eight days of the
February-March Revolution of 1917. This eight-day revolution was
“performed”, if we may use a metaphorical expression, as though after a
dozen major and minor rehearsals; the “actors” knew each other, their
parts, their places and their setting in every detail, through and through,
down to every more or less important shade of political trend and mode of
action.  

For the first great Revolution of 1905, which the Guchkovs and
Milyukovs and their hangers-on denounced as a “great rebellion”, led
after the lapse of twelve years, to the “brilliant”, the “glorious”
Revolution of 1917—the Guchkovs and Milyukovs have proclaimed it
“glorious” because it has put them in power (for the time
being). But this required a great, mighty and all-powerful “stage
manager”, capable, on the one hand, of vastly accelerating the course of
world

    

history, and, on the other, of engendering world-wide crises of
unparalleled intensity—economic, political, national and
international. Apart from an extraordinary acceleration of world history,
it was also necessary that history make particularly abrupt turns, in order
that at one such turn the filthy and blood-stained cart of the Romanov
monarchy should be overturned at one stroke.  

This all-powerful “stage manager”, this mighty accelerator was the
imperialist world war.  

That it is a world war is now indisputable, for the United States and
China are already half-involved today, and will be fully involved tomorrow.


That it is an imperialist war on both sides is now likewise
indisputable. Only the capitalists and their hangers-on, the
social-patriots and social-chauvinists, or—if instead of general critical
definitions we use political names familiar in Russia—only the Guchkovs
and Lvovs, Milyukovs and Shingaryovs on the one hand, and only the
Gvozdyovs, Potresovs, Chkhenkelis, Kerenskys and Chkheidzes on the other,
can deny or gloss over this fact. Both the German and the
Anglo-French bourgeoisie are waging the war for the plunder of foreign
countries and the strangling of small nations, for financial world
supremacy and the division and redivision of colonies, and in order to save
the tottering capitalist regime by misleading and dividing the workers of
the various countries.  

The imperialist war was bound, with objective inevitability, immensely
to accelerate and intensify to an unprecedented degree the class struggle
of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie; it was bound to turn into a
civil war between the hostile classes.  

This transformation has been started by the February–March
Revolution of 1917, the first stage of which has been marked, firstly, by a
joint blow at tsarism struck by two forces: one, the whole of bourgeois and
landlord Russia, with all her unconscious hangers-on and all her conscious
leaders, the British and French ambassadors and capitalists, and the other,
the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, which has begun to win over the
soldiers’ and peasants’
deputies.[2] 

These three political camps, these three fundamental political
forces—(1) the tsarist monarchy, the head of the feudal

    

landlords, of the old bureaucracy and the military caste;
(2) bourgeois and landlord-Octobrist-Cadet Russia, behind which trailed the
petty bourgeoisie (of which Kerensky and Chkheidze are the principal
representatives);
(3) the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, which is seeking to make the entire
proletariat and the entire mass of the poorest part of the population its
allies—these three fundamental political forces fully and
clearly revealed themselves even in the eight days of the “first stage”
and even to an observer so remote from the scene of events as the present
writer, who is obliged to content himself with the meagre foreign press
dispatches.  

But before dealing with this in greater detail, I must return to the
part of my letter devoted to a factor of prime importance, namely, the
imperialist world war.  

The war shackled the belligerent powers, the belligerent groups of
capitalists, the “bosses” of the capitalist system, the slave-owners of
the capitalist slave system, to each other with chains of
iron. One bloody clot—such is the social and political life
of the present moment in history.  

The socialists who deserted to the bourgeoisie on the outbreak of the
war—all these Davids and Scheidemanns in Germany and the Plekhanovs,
Potresovs, Gvozdyovs and Co. in Russia—clamoured loud and long against
the “illusions” of the revolutionaries, against the “illusions” of the
Basle Manifesto, against the “farcical dream” of turning the imperialist
war into a civil war. They sang praises in every key to the strength,
tenacity and adaptability allegedly revealed by capitalism—they, who had
aided the capitalists to “adapt”, tame, mislead and divide the working
classes of the various countries!  

But “he who laughs last laughs best”. The bourgeoisie has been unable
to delay for long the revolutionary crisis engendered by the war. That
crisis is growing with irresistible force in all countries, beginning with
Germany, which, according to an observer who recently visited that country,
is suffering “brilliantly organised famine”, and ending with England and
France, where famine is also looming, but where organisation is
far less “brilliant”.  

It was natural that the revolutionary crisis should have broken out
first of all in tsarist Russia, where the disorganisation was most
appalling and the proletariat most revolutionary

    

(not by virtue of any special qualities, but because of the living
traditions of 1905). This crisis was precipitated by the series of
extremely severe defeats sustained by Russia and her allies. They shook up
the old machinery of government and the old order and roused the anger of
all classes of the population against them; they embittered the
army, wiped out a very large part of the old commanding personnel, composed
of die-hard aristocrats and exceptionally corrupt bureaucratic elements,
and replaced it by a young, fresh, mainly bourgeois, commoner,
petty-bourgeois personnel. Those who, grovelling to the bourgeoisie or
simply lacking backbone, howled and wailed about “defeatism”, are now
faced by the fact of the historical connection between the defeat of the
most backward and barbarous tsarist monarchy and the beginning of
the revolutionary conflagration.  

But while the defeats early in the war were a negative factor that
precipitated the upheaval, the connection between Anglo-French
finance capital, Anglo-French imperialism, and Russian Octobrist-Cadet
capital was a factor that hastened this crisis by the direct
organisation of a plot against Nicholas Romanov.  

This highly important aspect of the situation is, for obvious reasons,
hushed up by the Anglo-French press and maliciously emphasised by the
German. We Marxists must soberly face the truth and not allow ourselves to
be confused either by the lies, the official sugary diplomatic and
ministerial lies, of the first group of imperialist belligerents, or by the
sniggering and smirking of their financial and military rivals of the other
belligerent group. The whole course of events in the February-March
Revolution clearly shows that the British and French embassies, with their
agents and “connections”, who had long been making the most desperate
efforts to prevent “separate” agreements and a separate peace between
Nicholas II (and last, we hope, and we will endeavour to make him that) and
Wilhelm II, directly organised a plot in conjunction with the Octobrists
and Cadets, in conjunction with a section of the generals and army and
St. Petersburg garrison officers, with the express object of
deposing Nicholas Romanov.  

Let us not harbour any illusions. Let us not make the mistake of those
who—like certain O.C. supporters or Mensheviks

    

who are oscillating between Gvozdyov-Potresov policy and internationalism
and only too often slip into petty-bourgeois pacifism—are now ready to
extol “agreement” between the workers’ party and the Cadets, “support”
of the latter by the former, etc. In conformity with the old (and by no
means Marxist) doctrine that they have learned by rote, they are trying to
veil the plot of the Anglo-French imperialists and the Guchkovs and
Milyukovs aimed at deposing the “chief warrior”, Nicholas Romanov, and
putting more energetic, fresh and more capable warriors in his
place.  

That the revolution succeeded so quickly and—seemingly, at the first
superficial glance—so radically, is only due to the fact that, as a
result of an extremely unique historical situation, absolutely
dissimilar currents, absolutely heterogeneous class interests,
absolutely contrary political and social strivings have
merged, and in a strikingly “harmonious” manner. Namely, the
conspiracy of the Anglo-French imperialists, who impelled Milyukov, Guchkov
and Co. to seize power for the purpose of continuing the imperialist
war, for the purpose of conducting the war still more ferociously and
obstinately, for the purpose of slaughtering fresh millions of
Russian workers and peasants in order that the Guchkovs might obtain
Constantinople, the French capitalists Syria, the British capitalists
Mesopotamia, and so on. This on the one hand. On the other, there was a
profound proletarian and mass popular movement of a revolutionary character
(a movement of the entire poorest section of the population of town and
country) for bread, for peace, for real freedom.


It would simply be foolish to speak of the revolutionary proletariat of
Russia “supporting” the Cadet-Octobrist imperialism, which has been
“patched up” with English money and is as abominable as tsarist
imperialism. The revolutionary workers were destroying, have already
destroyed to a considerable degree and will destroy to its foundations the
infamous tsarist monarchy. They are neither elated nor dismayed by
the fact that at certain brief and exceptional historical conjunctures
they were aided by the struggle of Buchanan, Guchkov, Milyukov and
Co. to replace one monarch by another monarch, also
preferably a Romanov!  

Such, and only such, is the way the situation developed. Such, and only
such, is the view that can be taken by a politician

    

who does not fear the truth, who soberly weighs the balance of social
forces in the revolution, who appraises every “current situation” not
only from the standpoint of all its present, current peculiarities, but
also from the standpoint of the more fundamental motivations, the deeper
interest-relationship of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, both in
Russia and throughout the world.  

The workers of Petrograd, like the workers of the whole of Russia,
self-sacrificingly fought the tsarist monarchy—fought for freedom, land
for the peasants, and for peace, against the imperialist
slaughter. To continue and intensify that slaughter, Anglo-French
imperialist capital hatched Court intrigues, conspired with the officers of
the Guards, incited and encouraged the Guchkovs and Milyukovs, and fixed up
a complete new government, which in fact did seize power
immediately the proletarian struggle had struck the first blows at tsarism.


This new government, in which Lvov and Guchkov of the Octobrists and
Peaceful Renovation
Party,[3] yesterday’s abettors of Stolypin the Hangman, control
really important posts, vital posts, decisive posts, the army and
the bureaucracy—this government, in which Milyukov and the other
Cadets[4] are more than anything decorations, a signboard—they are
there to deliver sentimental professorial speeches—and in which the
Trudovik[5] Kerensky is a balalaika on which they play to deceive the
workers and peasants—this government is not a fortuitous assemblage of
persons.  

They are representatives of the new class that has risen to political
power in Russia, the class of capitalist land lords and bourgeoisie which
has long been ruling our country economically, and which during
the Revolution of 1905–07, the counter-revolutionary period of 1907–14,
and finally—and with especial rapidity—the war period of 1914–17, was
quick to organise itself politically, taking over control of the local
government bodies, public education, congresses of various types, the Duma,
the war industries committees, etc. This new class was already “almost
completely” in power by 1917, and therefore it needed only the
first blows to bring tsarism to the ground and clear the way for the
bourgeoisie. The imperialist war, which required an incredible exertion of
effort, so accelerated the course of backward

    

Russia s development that we have “at one blow” (seemingly at
one blow) caught up with Italy, England, and almost with
France. We have obtained a “coalition”, a “national” (i.e., adapted for
carrying on the imperialist slaughter and for fooling the people)
“parliamentary” government.  

Side by side with this government—which as regards the
present war is but the agent of the billion-dollar “firm”
“England and France”—there has arisen the chief, unofficial, as yet
undeveloped and comparatively weak workers’ government, which
expresses the interests of the proletariat and of the entire poor section
of the urban and rural population. This is the Soviet of Workers’
Deputies in Petrograd, which is seeking connections with the soldiers
and peasants, and also with the agricultural workers, with the latter
particularly and primarily, of course, more than with the peasants.  

Such is the actual political situation, which we must first
endeavour to define with the greatest possible objective precision, in
order that Marxist tactics may he based upon the only possible solid
foundation—the foundation of facts.  

The tsarist monarchy has been smashed, but not finally destroyed.  

The Octobrist-Cadet bourgeois government, which wants to fight the
imperialist war “to a finish”, and which in reality is the agent of the
financial firm “England and France”, is obliged to promise the
people the maximum of liberties and sops compatible with the maintenance of
its power over the people and the possibility of continuing the imperialist
slaughter.  

The Soviet of Workers’ Deputies is an organisation of the workers, the
embryo of a workers’ government, the representative of the interests of the
entire mass of the poor section of the population, i.e., of
nine-tenths of the population, which is striving for peace, bread
and freedom.  

The conflict of these three forces determines the situation that has
now arisen, a situation that is transitional from the first stage
of the revolution to the second.  

The antagonism between the first and second force is not
profound, it is temporary, the result solely of the present
conjuncture of circumstances, of the abrupt turn of events in the
imperialist war. The whole of the new government is monarchist,
for Kerensky’s verbal republicanism simply

    

cannot be taken seriously, is not worthy of a statesman and,
objectively, is political chicanery. The new government, which has
not dealt the tsarist monarchy the final blow, has already begun to
strike a bargain with the landlord Romanov Dynasty. The bourgeoisie of
the Octobrist-Cadet type needs a monarchy to serve as the head of
the bureaucracy and the army in order to protect the privileges of capital
against the working people.  

He who says that the workers must support the new government
in the interests of the struggle against tsarist reaction (and apparently
this is being said by the Potresovs, Gvozdvovs. Chkhenkelis and also, all
evasiveness notwithstanding, by Chkheidze) is a traitor
to the workers, a traitor to the cause of the proletariat, to the cause of
peace and freedom. For actually, precisely this new government is
already bound hand and foot by imperialist capital, by the
imperialist policy of war and plunder, has already begun
to strike bargain (without consulting the people!) with the dynasty, is
already working to restore the tsarist monarchy, is already soliciting
the candidature of Mikhail Romanov as the new kinglet, is already taking
measures to prop up the throne, to substitute for the legitimate (lawful,
ruling by virtue of the old law) monarchy a Bonapartist, plebiscite
monarchy (ruling by virtue of a fraudulent plebiscite).  

No, if there is to lie a real struggle against the tsarist monarchy, if
freedom is to be guaranteed in fact and not merely in words, in the glib
promises of Milyukov and Kerensky, the workers must not support
the new government; the government must “support” the workers! For the
only guarantee of freedom and of the complete destruction of
tsarism lies in arming the proletariat, in strengthening,
extending and developing the role, significance and power of the Soviet of
Workers’ Deputies.  

All the rest is mere phrase-mongering and lies, self-deception on the
part of the politicians of the liberal and radical camp, fraudulent
trickery.  

Help, or at least do not hinder, the arming of the workers, and freedom
in Russia will be invincible, the monarchy irrestorable, the republic
secure.  

Otherwise the Guchkovs and Milyukovs will restore the monarchy and
grant none, absolutely none of the “liberties”

    

they promised. All bourgeois politicians in all bourgeois
revolutions “fed” the people and fooled the workers with promises.  

Ours is a bourgeois revolution, therefore, the workers must
support the bourgeoisie, say the Potresovs, Gvozdyovs and Chkheidzes, as
Plekhanov said yesterday.  

Ours is a bourgeois revolution, we Marxists say, therefore the
workers must open the eyes of the people to the deception practised by the
bourgeois politicians, teach them to put no faith in words, to depend
entirely on their own strength, their own organisation,
their own unity, and their own weapons.  

The government of the Octobrists and Cadets, of the Guchkovs and
Milyukovs, cannot, even if it sincerely wanted to (only infants
can think that Guchkov and Lvov are sincere), cannot give the
people either peace, bread, or freedom.  

It cannot give peace because it is a war government, a government for
the continuation of the imperialist slaughter, a government of
plunder, out to plunder Armenia, Galicia and Turkey, annex
Constantinople, reconquer Poland, Courland, Lithuania, etc. It is a
government bound hand and foot by Anglo-French imperialist capital. Russian
capital is merely a branch of the world-wide “firm” which manipulates
hundreds of billions of rubles and is called “England and
France”.  

It cannot give bread because it is a bourgeois government. At
best, it can give the people “brilliantly organised famine”, as
Germany has done. But the people will not accept famine. They will learn,
and probably very soon, that there is bread and that it can be obtained,
but only by methods that do not respect the sanctity of capital and
landownership.  

It cannot give freedom because it is a landlord and capitalist
government which fears the people and has already begun to strike
a bargain with the Romanov dynasty.  

The tactical problems of our immediate attitude towards this government
will be dealt with in another article. In it, we shall explain the
peculiarity of the present situation, which is a transition from
the first stage of the revolution to the second, and why the slogan, the
“task of the day”, at this moment must he: Workers, you hare
performed miracles of proletarian heroism, the heroism of the people, in
the
    

civil war against tsarism. You must perform miracles of organisation,
organisation of the proletariat and of the whole people, to prepare the way
for your victory in the second stage of the revolution.  

Confining ourselves for the present to an analysis of the
class struggle and the alignment of class forces at this stage of the
revolution, we have still to put the question: who are the proletariat’s
allies in this revolution?  

It has two allies: first, the broad mass of the
semi-proletarian and partly also of the small-peasant population, who
number scores of millions and constitute the overwhelming majority of the
population of Russia. For this mass peace, bread, freedom and land are
essential It is inevitable that to a certain extent this mass will
be under the influence of the bourgeoisie, particularly of the petty
bourgeoisie, to which it is most akin in its conditions of life,
vacillating between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The cruel lessons
of war, and they will be the more cruel the more vigorously the
war is prosecuted by Guchkov, Lvov, Milyukov and Co., will
inevitably push this mass towards the proletariat, compel it to
follow the proletariat. We must now take advantage of the relative freedom
of the new order and of the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies to
enlighten and organise this mass first of all and above
all. Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies and Soviets of Agricultural
Workers—that is one of our most urgent tasks. In this connection we shall
strive not only for the agricultural workers to establish their own
separate Soviets, but also for the propertyless and poorest peasants to
organise separately from the well-to-do peasants. The special
tasks and special forms of organisation urgently needed at the present time
will be dealt with in the next letter.  

Second, the ally of the Russian proletariat is the proletariat of all
the belligerent countries and of all countries in general. At present this
ally is to a large degree repressed by the war, and all too often the
European social-chauvinists speak in its name—men who, like Plekhanov,
Gvozdyov and Potresov in Russia, have deserted to the bourgeoisie. But the
liberation of the proletariat from their influence has progressed with
every month of the imperialist war, and the Russian revolution will
inevitably immensely hasten this process.  
 

With these two allies, the proletariat, utilising the
peculiarities of the present transition situation, can and will
proceed, first, to the achievement of a democratic republic and complete
victory of the peasantry over the landlords, instead of the
Guchkov-Milyukov semi-monarchy, and then to socialism, which alone
can give the war-weary people peace, bread and freedom.

Notes
 
 



[1]

The Pravda editors deleted about one-fifth of the first
letter. The cuts concern chiefly Lenin’s characterisation of the Menshevik
and Socialist-Revolutionary lenders as conciliators and flunkeys of the
bourgeoisie, their attempts to hide from the people the fact that
representatives of the British and French governments helped the Cadets and
Octobrists secure the abdication of Nicholas II, and also Lenin’s exposure
of the monarchist and imperialist proclivities of the Provisional
Government, which was determined to continue the predatory war.





[2]

Lenin here refers to the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ Deputies,
which emerged in the very early days of the February Revolution. Elections
to the Soviet began spontaneously at individual factories and within a few
days spread to all the factories in the capital. On February 27 (March 12),
before the Soviet had assembled for its first meeting, the Menshevik
liquidators K. A. Gvozdyov and B. 0. Bogdanov, and Duma members
N. S. Chkheidze, M. I. Skobelev and others proclaimed themselves the
Provisional Executive Committee of the Soviet in an attempt to bring it
under their complete control. At its first meeting, in the evening of the
same day, the Soviet formed a Presidium, composed of Chkheidze, Kerensky
and Skobelev who, together with A. G. Shlyapnikov, N. N. Sukhanov and
Y. M. Steklov, made up the Executive Committee. Provision was made for
inclusion of representatives of the central and Petrograd committees of the
socialist parties. The Socialist-Revolutionaries were at first opposed to
the organisation of the Soviet, but subsequently delegated their
representatives, V. A. Alexandrovich, V. M. Zenzinov and others.  

The Soviet proclaimed itself the or an of the workers and soldiers, and
up to the first Congress or soviets (June 1917) was factually an
all-Russian centre. On March 1 (14) the Executive Committee was extended to
include soldiers’ deputies. among them F. F. Linde, A. I. Paderin and
A. D. Sadovsky.  

The Bureau of the Executive Committee was composed among others, of
N. S. Chkheidze, Y. M. Steklov, B. 0. Bogdanov,

__PRINTERS_P_407_COMMENT__ 27*

   

P. ?. Stu&chatka, P. A. Krasikov, K. A. Gvozdyov, N. S. Chkheidze and
A. F. Kerensky were delegated to represent the Soviet on the Duma
Committee.  

On February 28 (March 13), the Soviet issued its Manifesto to the
Population of Petrograd and Russia. It called on the people to rally around
the Soviet and take over the administration of local affairs. On March 3
(16), the Soviet appointed several commissions—on food, military affairs,
public order and the press. The latter commission provided the first
editorial board of Izvestia, composed of N. D. Sokolov,
Y. M. Steklov, N. N. Sukhanov and K. S. Grinevich; V. A. Bazarov and
B. V. Avilov were added somewhat later.  

Meetings of the Executive Committee were attended, in a consultative
capacity, by the Social-Democratic members of all the four State Dumas,
five representatives of the Soldiers’ Commission, two representatives of
the Central Trade Union Bureau, representatives of the district Soviets,
the Izvestia editorial board, and other organisations.  

The Soviet appointed special delegates to organise district Soviets and
began the formation of a militia (100 volunteers for every 1,000 workers).


Though leadership of the Soviet was in the hands of compromising
elements, the pressure of the militant workers and soldiers compelled it to
take a number of revolutionary measures—the arrest of tsarist officials,
release of political prisoners, etc.  

On March 1 (14), the Soviet issued its “Order No. 1 to the Petrograd
Garrison”. It played a very big part in revolutionising the
army. Henceforth all military units were to be guided in their political
actions solely by the Soviet, all weapons were to be placed at the disposal
and under the control of company and battalion soldiers’ committees, orders
issued by the Provisional Committee of the State Duma were to be obeyed
only if they did not conflict with the orders of the Soviet, etc.  

But at the crucial moment, on the night following March 1 (14), the
compromising leaders of the Soviet Executive voluntarily turned over power
to the bourgeoisie: they endorsed the Provisional Government composed of
representatives of the bourgeoisie and landlords. This was not known
abroad, since papers standing to the left of the Cadets were not allowed
out of the country. Lenin learned of the surrender of power only when he
returned to Russia.





[3]

Octobrists—members of the Union of October Seventeen, a counter
revolutionary party formed after promulgation of the tsar’s Manifesto of
October 17 (30), 1905. It represented and upheld the interests of the big
bourgeoisie and of the landlords who ran their estates on capitalist
lines. Its leaders were A. I. Guchkov, a big Moscow manufacturer and real
estate owner, and M. V. Rodzyanko, a rich land lord. The Octobrists gave
their full support to the tsar’s home and foreign policy and in the First
World War joined the “Progressist bloc”, a sham opposition group
demanding responsible government, in other words, a government that would
enjoy the

   

confidence of the bourgeoisie and landlords. The Octobrists became the
ruling party after the February Revolution and did everything they could to
ward off socialist revolution. Their leader, Guchkov, was War Minister in
the first Provisional Government. Following the Great October Socialist
Revolution, the party became one of the main forces in the battle against
Soviet power.  

The party of Peaceful Renovation was a
constitutional-monarchist organisation of the big bourgeoisie and
landlords. It took final shape in 1906 following the dissolution of the
First Duma. It united the “Left” Octobrists and “Right” Cadets and its
chief leaders were P. A. Heiden, N. N. Lvov, P. P. Ryabushinsky,
M. A. Stakhovich, Y. N. and G. N. Trubetskoi, D. N. Shipov. Like the
Octobrists, it sought to safeguard and promote the interests of the
industrial and commercial bourgeoisie and of the landlords who ran their
estates along capitalist lines. In the Third Duma the party joined with the
so-called Party of Democratic Reforms to form the Progressist group.





[4]

Cadets—the name derives from the Constitutional-Democratic
Party, the chief party of the Russian liberal-monarchist
bourgeoisie. Founded in October 1905, it was composed chiefly of
capitalists, Zemstvo leaders, landlords and bourgeois
intellectuals. Prominent in the leadership were P. N. Milyukov,
S. A. Muromtsev, V. A. Maklakov, A. I. Shingaryov, P. B. Struve and
F. I. Rodichev. The Cadets became the party of the imperialist bourgeoisie
and in the First World War actively supported the tsarist government’s
predatory policies and in the February Revolution tried to save the
monarchy. The dominant force in the Provisional Government, they followed a
counter-revolutionary policy inimical to the people but advantageous to
U.S., British and French imperialism. Implacable enemies of Soviet power,
the Cadets had an active part in all the armed counter-revolutionary
actions and foreign intervention campaigns. Most of their leaders emigrated
after the defeat of the counter-revolutionary forces and continued their
anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary work abroad.





[5]

Trudovik—member of the Trudovik group in the State Dumas, formed
in April 1906 by petty-bourgeois democrats—peasants and intellectuals of
the Narodnik persuasion. The group wavered between the Cadets and the
revolutionary Social-Democrats, and in the First World War most of its
members adopted a social-chauvinist position.  

The Trudoviks spoke for the rich peasants, the kulaks, and after the
February Revolution actively supported the Provisional Government. One of
their representatives, Zarudny, became Minister of Justice following the
July events and directed the police campaign against the Bolsheviks. After
the October Revolution the Trudoviks sided with the counter-revolutionary
forces.

       This article contains Lenin’s famous April Theses read by him at
      two meetings of the All-Russia Conference of Soviets of Workers’
      and Soldiers’ Deputies, on April 4, 1917.
    

[Introduction]
I did not arrive in Petrograd until the night of April 3, and
      therefore at the meeting on April 4, I could, of course, deliver the
      report on the tasks of the revolutionary proletariat
      only on my own behalf, and with reservations as to insufficient
      preparation.
    
The only thing I could do to make things easier for myself—and for honest opponents—was to prepare the theses
      in writing. I read them out, and gave the text to Comrade Tsereteli. I
      read them twice very slowly: first at a meeting of Bolsheviks
      and then at a meeting of both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks.
    
I publish these personal theses of mine with only the briefest
      explanatory notes, which were developed in far greater detail in the report.
    
THESES

      1) In our attitude towards the war, which
      under the new [provisional] government of
      Lvov and
      Co. unquestionably remains on Russia’s part a predatory imperialist
      war owing to the capitalist nature of that government, not the
      slightest concession to “revolutionary defencism” is permissible.
    
The class-conscious proletariat can give its consent to a revolutionary
      war, which would really justify revolutionary defencism, only on condition:

    

      (a) that the power pass to the proletariat and the poorest sections of
      the peasants aligned with the proletariat;

    

      (b) that all annexations be
      renounced in deed and not in word;

    

      (c) that a complete break be effected
      in actual fact with all capitalist interests.
    
In view of the undoubted honesty of those broad sections of the
      mass believers in revolutionary defencism who accept the war only as a
      necessity, and not as a means of conquest,

 

  in view of the fact that
      they are being deceived by the bourgeoisie, it is necessary with
      particular thoroughness, persistence and patience to explain their
      error to them, to explain the inseparable connection existing between
      capital and the imperialist war, and to prove that without
      overthrowing capital it is impossible to end the war by a
      truly democratic peace, a peace not imposed by violence.
    
The most widespread campaign for this view must be organised in
      the army at the front.
    
Fraternisation.
    

      2) The specific feature of the present situation in Russia is that the
      country is passing from the first stage of the revolution—which, 
  owing to the insufficient class-consciousness and
      organisation of the proletariat, placed power in the hands of the
      bourgeoisie—to its second stage, which must place
      power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest sections of the
      peasants.
    

       This transition is characterised, on the one hand, by a maximum of
      legally recognised rights (Russia is now the freest of all
      the belligerent countries in the world); on the other, by the absence
      of violence towards the masses, and, finally, by their unreasoning
      trust in the government of capitalists, those worst enemies of peace
      and socialism.
    

  This peculiar situation demands of us an ability to adapt ourselves
      to the special conditions of Party work among unprecedentedly
      large masses of proletarians who have just awakened to political life.
    

      3) No support for the Provisional
Government; the utter falsity of all its promises should be made
      clear, particularly of those relating to the renunciation of
      annexations. Exposure in place of the impermissible, illusion-breeding
      “demand” that this government, a government of capitalists,
      should cease to be an imperialist government.
    

      4) Recognition of the fact that in most of the Soviets of Workers’
      Deputies our Party is in a minority, so far a small minority, as
      against a bloc of all the petty-bourgeois
opportunist
      elements, from the Popular
Socialists and the Socialist-Revolutionaries
      down to the Organising
Committee
(Chkheidze,
      Tsereteli,
      etc.), Steklov, etc., etc., who have yielded to the influence of the
      bourgeoisie and spread that influence among the proletariat.
    


      The masses must be made to see that the Soviets of
      Workers’ Deputies are the only possible form of revolutionary
      government, and that therefore our task is, as long as this
      government yields to the influence of the bourgeoisie, to present a
      patient, systematic, and persistent explanation of the errors of their
      tactics, an explanation especially adapted to the practical
      needs of the masses.
    

      As long as we are in the minority we carry on the work of
      criticising and exposing errors and at the same time we preach
      the necessity of transferring the entire state power to the
      Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, so that the people may overcome
      their mistakes by experience.
    

      5) Not a parliamentary republic—to return to a parliamentary republic from
      the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies would be a retrograde step—but a republic
      of Soviets of Workers’, Agricultural Labourers’ and Peasants’ Deputies
      throughout the country, from top to bottom.
    
Abolition of the police, the army and the
bureaucracy.[1]

The salaries of all officials, all of whom are elective and displaceable
      at any time, not to exceed the average wage of a competent worker.
    

      6) The weight of emphasis in the agrarian programme to be shifted to the Soviets
  of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.

Confiscation of all landed estates.

Nationalisation of all lands in the country, the land to
      be disposed of by the local Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ and
      Peasants’ Deputies.  The organisation of separate Soviets of Deputies
      of Poor Peasants. The setting up of a model farm on each of the large
      estates (ranging in size from 100 to 300 dessiatines,
      according to local and other conditions, and to the decisions of the
      local bodies) under the control of the Soviets of Agricultural
      Labourers’ Deputies and for the public account.
    

      7) The immediate union of all banks in the country into a single national
      bank, and the institution of control over it by the Soviet of Workers’
      Deputies.
    



      8) It is not our immediate task to “introduce” socialism, but
      only to bring social production and the distribution of products at
      once under the control of the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies.
    

      9) Party tasks:
    

      (a) Immediate convocation of a Party congress;

    

      (b) Alteration of
      the Party Programme, mainly:
    

      (1) On the question of imperialism and the imperialist war,
    

      (2) On our attitude towards the state and our demand for a “commune
  state”[2];
    

      (3) Amendment of our out-of-date minimum programme;
    

      (c) Change of the Party’s
      name.[3]


      10. A new International.
    
We must take the initiative in creating a revolutionary
      International, an International against the social-chauvinists
      and against the “Centre”.[4]

In order that the reader may understand why I had especially to
      emphasise as a rare exception the “case” of honest opponents, I invite
      him to compare the above theses with the following objection by
      Mr. Goldenberg:

    

       Lenin, he said, “has planted the banner of civil war in the midst of
      revolutionary democracy”

    

      (quoted in No. 5 of Mr. Plekhanov’s
Yedinstvo).
    
 Isn’t it a gem?
    
I write, announce and elaborately explain: “In view
      of the undoubted honesty of those broad sections of the
      mass believers in revolutionary defencism ... in view of the
      fact that they are being deceived by the bourgeoisie, it is necessary
      with particular thoroughness, persistence and
      patience to explain their error to them....”
    

Yet the bourgeois gentlemen who call themselves Social-Democrats,
   who do not belong either to the broad sections or to 
   the mass believers in defencism, with serene brow present my views thus:

    

      “The banner[!] of civil war” (of which there is not a word in the
      theses and not a word in my speech!) has been planted(!) “in the midst
      [!!] of revolutionary democracy...”.
    
 What does this mean? In what way does this differ from
      riot-inciting agitation, from Russkaya
Volya?
    
I write, announce and elaborately explain: “The
      Soviets of Workers’ Deputies are the only possible form of
      revolutionary government, and therefore our task is to present a
      patient, systematic, and persistent explanation of the errors
      of their tactics, an explanation especially adapted to the practical
      needs of the masses.”
    
Yet opponents of a certain brand present my views as a call to
      “civil war in the midst of revolutionary democracy”!
    
I attacked the Provisional Government for not having
      appointed an early date or any date at all, for the convocation of the
      Constituent
Assembly, and for confining itself to promises. I argued that
      without the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies the
      convocation of the Constituent Assembly is not guaranteed and its
      success is impossible.
    
And the view is attributed to me that I am opposed to the speedy
      convocation of the Constituent Assembly!
    
I would call this “raving”, had not decades of political struggle
      taught me to regard honesty in opponents as a rare exception.
    
Mr. Plekhanov
      in his paper called my speech “raving”. Very good, Mr. Plekhanov! But
      look how awkward, uncouth and slow-witted you are in your polemics. If
      I delivered a raving speech for two hours, how is it that an audience
      of hundreds tolerated this “raving”? Further, why does your paper
      devote a whole column to an account of the “raving”? Inconsistent,
      highly inconsistent!
    

It is, of course, much easier to shout, abuse, and howl than to
      attempt to relate, to explain, to recall what Marx and Engels
      said in 1871, 1872 and 1875 about the experience of the Paris
Commune and about the kind of state the proletariat
      needs. [See:
The Civil
  War in France and Critique of the
  Gotha Programme]

Ex-Marxist Mr. Plekhanov evidently does not care to recall Marxism.
    
I quoted the words of Rosa
 Luxemburg, who on August 4,
 1914, called

German
Social-Democracy a “stinking corpse”. And the Plekhanovs,
      Goldenbergs and Co. feel “offended”. On whose behalf? On behalf of the
      German chauvinists, because they were called chauvinists!
    
They have got themselves in a mess, these poor Russian 
social-chauvinists—socialists in word and chauvinists in deed.

      Instead of “Social-Democracy”, whose official
      leaders throughout the world have betrayed socialism and deserted to the
      bourgeoisie (the “defencists” and the vacillating “Kautskyites”), 
  we must call ourselves the Communist Party.—Lenin

  The “Centre” in
      the international Social-Democratic movement is the trend which
      vacillates between the chauvinists (=“defencists”) and
      internationalists, i.e., Kautsky and Co. in Germany, Longuet and
      Co. in France, Chkheidze and Co. in Russia, Turati and Co. in Italy,
      MacDonald and Co. in Britain, etc.—Lenin

The basic question of every revolution is that of state
power. Unless this question is understood, there can be no
intelligent participation in the revolution, not to speak of
guidance of the revolution.


The highly remarkable feature of our revolution is that it has
brought about a dual power. This fact must be grasped
first and foremost: unless it is understood, we cannot
advance. We must know how to supplement and amend old
âformulasâ, for example, those of Bolshevism, for while they
have been found to be correct on the whole, their concrete
realisation has turned out to
be different. Nobody previously thought, or could
have thought, of a dual power.


What is this dual power? Alongside the Provisional Government,
the government of bourgeoisie, another government has
arisen, so far weak and incipient, but undoubtedly a government
that actually exists and is growing—the Soviets of Workersâ
and Soldiersâ Deputies.


What is the class composition of this other government? It
consists of the proletariat and the peasants (in soldiersâ
uniforms). What is the political nature of this government? It
is a revolutionary dictatorship, i.e., a power directly based on
revolutionary seizure, on the direct initiative of the people
from below, and not on a law enacted by a centralised
state power. It is an entirely different kind of power from the
one that generally exists in the parliamentary
bourgeois-democratic republics of the usual type still
prevailing in the advanced countries of Europe and America. This
circumstance often over looked, often not given enough thought,
yet it is the crux of the matter. This power is of
the same type as the Paris
Commune of 1871. The fundamental

    

characteristics of this
type are:


(1) the source of power is not a law previously discussed and
enacted by parliament, but the direct initiative of the
people from below, in their local areas—direct âseizureâ,
to use a current expression;


(2) the replacement of the police and the army, which are
institutions divorced from the people and set against the
people, by the direct arming of the whole people; order in
the state under such a power is maintained by the armed
workers and peasants themselves, by the armed
people themselves ;


(3) officialdom, the bureaucracy, are either similarly replaced
by the direct rule of the people themselves or at least
placed under special control; they not only become elected
officials, but are also subject to recall at the
peopleâs first demand; they are reduced to the position of
simple agents; from a privileged group
holding âjobs â remunerated on a high, bourgeois
scale, they become workers of a special âarm of the
serviceâ, whose remuneration does not exceed the
ordinary pay of a competent worker.


This, and this alone , constitutes the essence 
of the Paris Commune as a special type of state. This essence
has been forgotten or perverted by the Plekhanovs (downright
chauvinists who have betrayed Marxism), the Kautskys (the men of
the âCentreâ, i.e., those who vacillate between chauvinism and
Marxism), and generally by all those Social-Democrats,
Socialist-Revolutionaries, etc., etc., who now rule the roost.


They are trying to get away with empty phrases, evasions,
subterfuges; they congratulate each other a thousand times upon
the revolution, but refuse to consider what the Soviets
of Workersâ and Soldiersâ Deputies are . They refuse to
recognise the obvious truth that in as much as these Soviets
exist, in as much as they are a power, we have in
Russia a state of the type of the Paris Commune.


I have emphasised the words âin as much asâ, for it is only an
incipient power. By direct agreement with the bourgeois
Provisional Government and by a series of actual concessions, it
has itself surrendered and is surrendering its positions
to the bourgeoisie.


Why? Is it because Chkheidze, Tsereteli, Steklov and Co. are
making a âmistakeâ? Nonsense. Only a philistine can think so—not a
Marxist. The reason is insufficient
class-consciousness
    

and organisation of the proletarians
and peasants. The âmistakeâ of the leaders I have named lies in
their petty-bourgeois position, in the fact that instead of
clarifying the minds of the workers, they are befogging 
them; instead of dispelling petty-bourgeois illusions,they are
instilling them; instead of freeing the people from
bourgeois influence, they are strengthening that
influence.


It should be clear from this why our comrades, too, make so many
mistakes when putting the question âsimplyâ: Should the
Provisional Government be overthrown immediately?


My answer is:


(1) it should be overthrown, for it is an oligarchic, bourgeois,
and not a peopleâs government, and is unable to
provide peace, bread, or full freedom;


(2) It cannot be overthrown just now, for it is being kept in
power by a direct and indirect, a formal and actual
agreement with the Soviets of Workersâ Deputies, and
primarily with the chief Soviet, the Petrograd Soviet;

 (3) generally, it can not be âoverthrownâ in the ordinary way,
for it rests on the âsupport â given to the
bourgeoisie by the second government—the Soviet
of Workersâ Deputies, and that government is the only
possible revolutionary government, which directly expresses
the mind and will of the majority of the workers and
peasants. Humanity has not yet evolved and we do not as yet
know a type of government superior to and better than the
Soviets of Workersâ, Agricultural Labourersâ, Peasantsâ, and
Soldiersâ Deputies.


To become a power the class-conscious workers must win the
majority to their side. As long as no violence is used
against the people there is no other road to power. We are not
Blancists, we do not stand for the seizure of power by a
minority. We are Marxists, we stand for proletarian class
struggle against petty-bourgeois intoxication, against
chauvinism-defencism, phrase-mongering and dependence on the
bourgeoisie.


Let us create a proletarian Communist Party; its elements have
already been created by the best adherents of Bolshevism; let us
rally our ranks for proletarian class work; and larger and
larger numbers from among the proletarians, from among the
poorest peasants will range themselves on our side. For
actual experience will from day to day shatter the
petty-bourgeois illusions of those âSocial-Democratsâ,

    

the
Chkheidzes, Tseretelis, Steklovs and others, the âSocialist
Revolutionariesâ, the petty bourgeois of an even purer water,
and so on and so forth.


The bourgeoisie stands for the undivided power of the
bourgeoisie.


The class-conscious workers stand for the undivided power of the
Soviets of Workersâ, Agricultural Labourersâ, Peasantsâ, and
Soldiersâ Deputies—for undivided power made possible not by
adventurist acts, but by clarifying proletarian minds,
by emancipating them from the influence of the
bourgeoisie.


The petty bourgeoisie—âSocial-Democratsâ, Socialist-Revolutionaries,
etc., etc.—vacillate and, thereby,
hinder this clarification and emancipation.


This is the actual, the class alignment of forces that
determines our tasks.

Petrograd and the whole of Russia have passed through a serious
      political crisis, the first political crisis since the
      revolution.


On April 18 the Provisional Government issued its unhappily
      notorious Note, which confirmed the predatory aims of the war
      clearly enough to arouse the indignation of the masses, who had
      honestly believed in the desire (and ability) of the capitalists
      to “renounce annexations”. On April 20-21 Petrograd was in a
      turmoil. The streets were crowded; day and night knots and
      groups of people stood about, and meetings of various sizes
      sprang up everywhere; big street processions and demonstrations
      went on without a break. Yesterday evening, April 21, the
      crisis, or, at any rate, the first stage of the crisis,
      apparently came to an end with the Executive Committee of the
      Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, and later the Soviet
      itself, declaring themselves satisfied with the “explanations”,
      the amendments to the Note and the “elucidations” made by the
      government (which in fact boil down to empty phrases, saying
      absolutely nothing, changing nothing and committing the
      government to nothing). They considered the “incident
      settled”.


Whether the masses consider the “incident settled”, the future
      will show. Our task now is to make a careful study of the
      forces, the classes, that revealed themselves in the
      crisis, and to draw the relevant lessons for our proletarian
      party. For it is the great significance of all crises that they
      make manifest what has been hidden; they cast aside all that is
      relative, superficial, and trivial; they sweep away the
      political litter and reveal the real mainsprings of the
      class struggle.

 

Strictly speaking, the capitalist government on April 18 merely
      reiterated its previous notes, in which the imperialist war was
      invested with diplomatic equivocations. The soldiers were angry
      because they had honestly believed in the sincerity and peaceful
      intentions of the capitalists. The demonstrations began as
      soldiers’ demonstrations, under the contradictory,
      misguided and ineffectual slogan: “Down with Milyukov”
      (as though a change of persons or groups could change the
      substance of policy!).


This means that the broad, unstable, and vacillating mass, which
      is closest to the peasantry and which by its scientific class
      definition is petty-bourgeois, swung away from the
      capitalists towards the revolutionary workers. It was
      the swing or movement of this mass, strong enough to be a
      decisive factor, that caused the crisis.


It was at this point that other sections began to stir:
      not the middle but the extreme elements, not
      the intermediary petty bourgeoisie but the bourgeoisie and the
      proletariat, started to come out on to the streets and
      organise.


The bourgeoisie seized Nevsky Prospekt—or “Milyukov”
      Prospekt as one paper called it—and the adjacent quarters
      of prosperous Petrograd, the Petrograd of the capitalists and
      the government officials. Officers, students, and “the middle
      classes” demonstrated in favour of the Provisional
      Government. Among the slogans, “Down with Lenin” frequently
      appeared on the banners.


The proletariat rallied in its own centres, the
      working-class suburbs, around the slogans and appeals of our
      Party’s Central Committee. On April 20-21 the Central Committee
      adopted resolutions, which were immediately passed on to the
      proletariat through the Party organisations. The workers poured
      through the poor, less central districts, and then in
      groups got through to Nevsky. By their mass character and
      solidarity, these demonstrations were very different from those
      of the bourgeoisie. Many banners carried the inscription “All
      Power to the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies”.


On Nevsky there were clashes. The “hostile” demonstrations tore
      down each other’s banners. The Executive Committee received news
      by telephone from various places that there was shooting on both
      sides, that there were killed and

    

wounded; but the information
      was extremely contradictory and unconfirmed.


The bourgeoisie shouted about the “spectre of civil war”, thus
      expressing its fear that the real masses, the actual majority of
      the nation, might seize power. The petty-bourgeois leaders of
      the Soviet, the Mensheviks and Narodniks—who since the
      revolution in general, and during the crisis in particular, have
      had no definite party policy—allowed themselves to be
      intimidated. In the Executive Committee almost half the votes
      were cast against the Provisional Government on the eve of the
      crisis, but now thirty-four votes (with nineteen against) are
      cast in favour of returning to a policy of confidence
      in and agreement with the capitalists.


And the “incident” was considered “settled”.


What is the essence of the class struggle? The
      capitalists are for dragging out the war under cover of
      empty phrases and false promises. They are caught in the meshes
      of Russian, Anglo-French and American banking
      capital. The proletariat, as represented by its class-conscious
      vanguard, stands for the transfer of power to the
      revolutionary class, the working class and the
      semi-proletarians, for the development of a world
      workers’ revolution, a revolution which is clearly developing
      also in Germany, and for terminating the war by means
      of such a revolution.


The vast mass of people, chiefly the petty bourgeoisie, who
      still believe the Menshevik and Narodnik leaders and who have
      been absolutely intimidated by the bourgeoisie and are carrying
      out its policy, although with reservations, are
      swinging now to the right, now to the left.


The war is terrible; it has hit the vast mass of the people
      hardest of all; it is these people who are becoming aware,
      albeit still very vaguely, that the war is criminal, that it is
      being carried on through the rivalry and scramble of the
      capitalists, for the division of their spoils. The
      world situation is growing more and more involved. The only
      way out is a world workers’ revolution, a revolution which
      is now more advanced in Russia than in any other
      country, but which is clearly mounting (strikes, fraternisation)
      in Germany too. And the people are wavering: wavering between
      confidence in their old masters, the capitalists, and bitterness towards them; between confidence in the new class, the

    

only
      consistently revolutionary class, which opens up the prospect of
      a bright future for all the working people—the
      proletariat—and a vague awareness of its role in world
      history.


This is not the first time the petty bourgeoisie and semi
      proletarians have wavered and it will not be the
      last!


The lesson is clear, comrade workers! There is no time to be
      lost. The first crisis will be followed by others. You must
      devote all your efforts to enlightening the backward,
      to making extensive, comradely and direct contact (not only by
      meetings) with every regiment and with every group of working
      people who have not had their eyes opened yet! All your
      efforts must be devoted to consolidating your own ranks, to
      organising the workers from the bottom upwards, including every
      district, every factory, every quarter of the capital and its
      suburbs! Do not be misled by those of the petty
      bourgeoisie ’who “compromise” with the capitalists, by the
      defencists and by the “supporters”, nor by individuals who are
      inclined to be in a hurry and to shout “Down with the
      Provisional Government!” before the majority of the people are
      solidly united. The crisis cannot be over come by violence
      practised by individuals against individuals, by the local
      action of small groups of armed people, by Blanquist attempts to
      “seize power”, to “arrest” the Provisional Government, etc.


Today’s task is to explain more precise]y, more clearly, more
      widely the proletariat’s policy, its way of terminating
      the war. Rally more resolutely, more widely, wherever you can,
      to the ranks and columns of the proletariat! Rally round your
      Soviets; and within them endeavour to rally behind you a
      majority by comradely persuasion and by reelection of individual
      members!

{1}
The Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the
R.S.D.L.P.(B.) was called by decision of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) Central
Committee, taken between April 4 and 8 (17 and 21), and was held in
Petrograd from April 24 to 29 (May 7–12), 1917. It was the Party’s first
conference in legal conditions. It was attended by 131 delegates with vote
and 18 with voice from 78 Party organisations (including Petrograd and its
environments, Moscow and Moscow District, the Central Industrial Area, the
Urals, the Donbas, the Volga area and the Caucasus) and also by
representatives of front and rear military organisations, the national
organisations of Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Finland and Estonia. On the
strength of its representation and the political and organisational tasks
it dealt with, the Conference could perform and did perform the work of a
Party congress: it worked out the political line for the whole Party and
set up the Party governing centres.  

At 2 p.m. on the day before it opened, there was a meeting of more than
a hundred delegates at which new items were added to the agenda and the
standing orders of the Conference were approved. A report on the April
21–22 events was given by Lenin who was met with warm applause. On the
agenda of the Conference were the following questions: the current
situation (the war and the Provisional Government, etc.), a peace
conference, attitude to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies,
revision of the Party Programme, the situation within the International and
the Party’s tasks, unification of the internationalist Social-Democratic
organisations, agrarian question, national question, Constituent Assembly,
organisational question, reports by regions and elections to the Central
Committee.  

Lenin opened the Conference with a brief speech of welcome and was
elected to the presidium. He directed all the work of the Conference.  

The Conference exposed and rejected the Right-wing capitulatory line of
L. B. Kamenev, who gave a co-report on the present situation as the
representative of an anti-Leninist group. L. B. Kamenev and A. I. Rykov
tried to oppose the Leninist line towards the socialist revolution by the
opportunist assessment of the 1917 revolution, and the prospects of its
development. Denying the possibility and need for the bourgeois-democratic
revolution to develop into a socialist revolution, Kamenev proposed that
the



Conference should confine itself to accepting control over the bourgeois
Provisional Government on the part of the Menshevik S.R. Soviets. The
Conference rejected the capitulatory stand of Kamenev and his small group
of supporters, who denied the possibility of the victory of socialism in
Russia.  

In his report on the revision of the Party Programme, Lenin determined
the direction in which the Programme Committee set up by the Conference was
to rewrite the Programme of 1903.  

During the debate on the national question, G. L. Pyatakov spoke
against Lenin’s slogan of the right of nations to self-determination
including secession and the formation of an independent state. In support
of his resolution on the national question, Lenin said that this right
alone ensured complete solidarity of workers and all working people of
different nationalities; while the expediency of secession was to be
decided by the proletarian party “in each particular case, having regard
to the interests of social development as a whole and the interests of the
class struggle of the proletariat for socialism”

(see present edition, Vol. 24, pp. 302–03).



Lenin’s thesis on the break with the Zimmerwald Centrist majority and
the establishment of the Third, Communist International was opposed by
G. Y. Zinoviev. The Conference made a mistake by voting for the Bolsheviks’
participation in the Third Zimmerwald Conference, which was predominantly
Centrist in composition, thereby delaying preparations for the
establishment of the Third, Communist International. Life itself very soon
corrected this mistake

(see present edition, Vol. 24, p. 388, and the unfinished article “The
Tasks of Our Party in the International”, Vol. 26, pp. 220–22).



The Conference elected the Central Committee headed by Lenin. 

The historic importance of the Seventh (April) Conference lay in the
fact that it adopted Lenin’s programme for transition to the second stage
of the revolution in Russia, mapped out the struggle for the development of
the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist revolution and put
forward the demand for the transfer of all power to the Soviets. Under this
slogan, the Bolsheviks prepared the masses for the proletarian revolution.

Workers, comrades!
    

The All-Russia Conference of the Russian Social-Democratic
      Labour Party, united by its Central Committee and  known simply
      as the Bolshevik Party, is over.
    

The Conference has adopted very important resolutions on all the
      fundamental issues of the revolution and the full text of them
      is published below.
    

The revolution is passing through a crisis. This could be seen
      in the streets of Petrograd and Moscow between  April
      19  and April 21. This has been admitted by the
      Provisional Government. It has been admitted by the  Executive
      Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’  and Soldiers’
      Deputies. Still further confirmation of it has been given, as I
      pen these lines, by the resignation of Guchkov.
    

This crisis of state power, this crisis of the revolution, is no
      accident. The Provisional Government is a government of
      landowners and capitalists who are tied up with Russian  and
      Anglo-French capital and compelled to continue the imperialist
      war. But the soldiers are worn out by  the war, they are
      becoming more and more aware that the war is being fought in the
      interests of the capitalists; the soldiers do not want
      war. Furthermore, the grim  spectre of an appalling debacle, of
      famine and complete economic ruin is advancing upon Russia and
      other  countries.
    
 

The Petrograd Soviet has also got into a blind alley by entering
      into an agreement with the Provisional Government, by supporting
      it, by supporting the loan, and, consequently, supporting the
      war. The Soviet is responsible for the Provisional Government,
      and, seeing no way out of the situation, has also got itself
      into a muddle through  this agreement with the capitalist
      government.
    

At this great historic moment, when the future of the
      revolution is at stake, when the capitalists are torn between
      despair and the thought of shooting down workers, our Party
      appeals to the people, saying in its Conference resolutions:
    

We must understand which  classes  are the motive force
      of the revolution. Their various aspirations must be soberly
      assessed. The capitalist cannot travel the same road as the
      worker. Petty proprietors can neither fully trust the
      capitalists nor all immediately agree on a close fraternal
      alliance with the workers. Only when we understand the
      difference between these classes shall we be able to find the
      correct road for the revolution.
    

The decisions of our Conference on all the basic issues of the
      people’s life draw a clear line between the interests  of the
      different classes and show that it is absolutely impossible to
      find a way out of  the deadlock unless the policy of  trust in
      and support of the capitalist government is abandoned.
    

The situation is one of unparalleled difficulty. There  is one
      way out and only one—the transfer of all state power to the
      Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’, Peasants’, and other Deputies
      throughout Russia, from the bottom up. Only  if state power
      passes to the working class supported by most of the peasantry,
      will it be possible to count on speedily regaining the
      confidence of the workers of other countries, to count on a
      mighty European revolution that will throw off the yoke of
      Capital and put an end to the criminal blood shed in which the
      peoples are embroiled. Only if the power passes to the working
      class supported by most of the peasants shall we  be able to
      cherish the firm hope that the working  people will show
      complete confidence in that power and all, without exception,
      work selflessly to bring about a transformation of the entire
      way of life of the people in the

    

interests of those who labour
      and not in the interests of the capitalists and
      landowners. Without such selfless work, with out a gigantic
      effort on the part of each and every individual, without
      firmness and the determination to rebuild life in a  new way,
      without the strict organisation and comradely discipline of all
      workers and all poor peasants—without  all this there
      is no way out.


The war has brought all mankind to the brink of destruction. The
      capitalists  have become deeply involved in the  war and are
      unable to extricate themselves. The whole  world faces disaster.
    

Workers, comrades! The time is drawing near when events  will
      demand new and still greater heroism—the heroism of
      millions and tens of millions—than you displayed in the
      glorious days of the revolution of February and March. Prepare
      yourselves.
    

Prepare yourselves and remember that  if, together with the
      capitalists, you were able to achieve victory in a few days by a
      simple outburst of popular wrath, you will need more than that
      for victory against the capitalists, for victory over the
      capitalists. To achieve such a victory, to have the workers and
      poor peasants take the power, keep that power  and make proper
      use of  it, you will need organisation, organisation, and
      organisation.
    

Our Party is helping you as much as it can, primarily by
      bringing home to you the different positions of the  different
      classes and their different strength. The decisions of  our
      Conference are devoted to this, and unless you realise this
      clearly, organisation does not mean anything. And  without
      organisation action by the millions is impossible, success is
      impossible.
    

Don’t put your trust in words. Don’t be misled by
      promises. Don’t overestimate your strength. Organise at every
      factory, in every regiment and every company, in every
      residential block. Work at your organising every day, every
      hour; do that work yourselves, for this is something you cannot
      entrust to anybody else. Work to steadily,  soundly and
      indestructibly build up full confidence in the advanced workers
      on the part of the masses.  Such is the main content of all the
      decisions of our Conference. Such is the main lesson taught by
      the entire

    

development of the revolution. Such is the one
      guarantee of success.
    

Workers, comrades! We call upon you to carry out the hard,
      serious, untiring work of consolidating the class-conscious,
      revolutionary proletariat of all countries. This is the one and
      only way out, the only way to save mankind from the horrors of
      war and the yoke of Capital.

1
Speech On The Attitude Towards The Provisional Government
      June 4 (17)
    

Comrades, in the brief time at my disposal, I can dwell—and
      I think this best—only on the main questions of principle
      raised by the Executive Committee rapporteur and by subsequent
      speakers.


The first and fundamental issue before us was: what is this
      assembly we are attending, what are these Soviets now
      gathered at the All-Russia Congress, and what is this
      revolutionary democracy that people here speak so much about to
      conceal their utter misunderstanding and complete repudiation of
      it? To talk about revolutionary democracy at the All-Russia
      Congress of Soviets and obscure this institution’s character,
      its class composition and its role in the revolution—not to
      say a word about this and yet lay claim to the title of
      democrats really is peculiar. They map out a programme to us for
      a bourgeois parliamentary republic, the sort of programme that
      has existed all over Western Europe; they map out a programme to
      us for reforms which are now recognised by all bourgeois
      governments, including our own, and yet they talk to us about
      revolutionary democracy. Whom are they talking to? To the
      Soviets. But I ask you, is there a country in Europe, a
      bourgeois, democratic, republican country, where anything like
      these Soviets exists? You have to admit there isn’t. Nowhere is
      there, nor can there be, a similar institution because you must
      have one or the other: either a bourgeois government
      with “plans” for reforms like those just mapped out to us and
      proposed dozens of times in every country but remaining on
      paper, or the institution to which they are now
      referring, the new type of “government” created by the
      revolution, examples of which

    

      can be found only at a time of greatest revolutionary upsurge,
      as in France, 1792 and 1871, or in Russia, 1905. The Soviets are
      an institution which does not exist in any ordinary
      bourgeois-parliamentary state and cannot exist side by side with
      a bourgeois government. They are the new, more democratic type
      of state which we in our Party resolutions call a
      peasant-proletarian democratic republic, with power belonging
      solely to the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. People
      are wrong in thinking that this is a theoretical issue. They are
      wrong in pretending that it can be evaded and in protesting that
      at present certain institutions exist side by side with the
      Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. Yes, they do exist
      side by side. But this is what breeds countless
      misunderstandings, conflicts and friction. And this is why the
      original upswing, the original advance, of the Russian
      revolution is giving way to stagnation and to those steps
      backwards which we can now see in our coalition
      government,
      in its entire home and foreign policy, in
      connection with preparations for an imperialist offensive.


One or the other: either the usual bourgeois government, in
      which case the peasants’, workers’, soldiers’ and other Soviets
      are useless and will either be broken up by the generals, the
      counter-revolutionary generals, who keep a hold on the armed
      forces and pay no heed to Minister Kerensky’s fancy speeches, or
      they will die an inglorious death. They have no other
      choice. They can neither retreat nor stand still. They can exist
      only by advancing. This is a type of state not invented by the
      Russians but advanced by the revolution because the revolution
      can win in no other way. Within the All-Russia Congress,
      friction and the struggle of parties for power are
      inevitable. But this will be the elimination of possible
      mistakes and illusions through the political experience of the
      masses themselves (commotion), and not through the
      reports of Ministers who refer to what they said yesterday, what
      they will write tomorrow and what they will promise the day
      after tomorrow. This, comrades, is ridiculous from the point of
      view of the institution created by the Russian revolution and
      now faced with the question: to be or not to be? The Soviets
      cannot continue to exist as they do now. Grown people, workers
      and peasants, are made to meet, adopt resolutions and listen to
      reports that cannot

    

be subjected to any documentary
      verification! This kind of institution is a transition to a
      republic which will establish a stable power without a police
      and a standing army, not in words alone but in action, a power
      which cannot yet exist in Western Europe and without which the
      Russian revolution cannot win in the sense of victory over the
      landowners and over imperialism.


Without this power there can be no question of our gaining such
      a victory by ourselves. And the deeper we go into the programme
      recommended to us here, and into the facts with which we are
      confronted, the more glaringly the fundamental contradiction
      stands out. We are told by the rapporteur and by other speakers
      that the first Provisional
      Government was a bad one! But when the Bolsheviks, those
      wretched Bolsheviks, said, "No support for and no confidence in
      this government", how often we were accused of “anarchism”! Now
      everybody says that the previous government was a bad one. But
      how does the coalition government with its near socialist
      Ministers differ from the previous one? Haven’t we had enough
      talk about programmes and drafts? Haven’t we had enough of them?
      Isn’t it time to get down to business? A month has passed since
      May 6 when the coalition government was formed. Look at the
      facts, look at the ruin prevailing in Russia and other countries
      involved in the imperialist war. What is the reason for the
      ruin? The predatory nature of the capitalists. There’s your real
      anarchy. And this is admitted in statements published, not in
      our newspaper, not in any Bolshevik newspaper—Heaven
      forbid!—but in the ministerial Rabochaya
      Gazeta which has reported that industrial coal prices
      were raised by the “revolutionary” government!! The
      coalition government hasn’t changed a thing in this respect. We
      are asked whether socialism can be introduced in Russia, and
      whether, generally speaking, radical changes can be made at
      once. That is all empty talk comrades. The doctrine of Marx and
      Engels, as they always explained, says: "Our doctrine is not a
      dogma, but a guide to
action.”[1] Nowhere in the world is there pure
      capitalism developing into pure socialism, nor can there be in
      war-time. But there is something in between, something new and
      unprecedented, because hundreds of millions of people who have
      been involved in the criminal war among the capitalists

    

are
      losing their lives. It is not a question of promising
      reforms—that is mere talk. It is a question of taking the
      step we now need.
    

If you want to talk of "revolutionary" democracy, then
      you must distinguish this concept from reformist
      democracy under a capitalist Ministry, because it is high time
      to stop talking about "revolutionary democracy", handing out
      mutual congratulations on "revolutionary democracy", and get on
      with a class definition, as we have been taught by
      Marxism, and by scientific socialism generally. It is being
      proposed that we should pass to reformist democracy under a
      capitalist Ministry. That may be all well and good from the
      standpoint of the usual West-European models. A number of
      countries, however, are today on the brink of destruction, and
      we can clearly see the practical measures said to be too
      complicated to carry out easily, and in need of special
      elaboration, according to the previous speaker, the Minister of
      Posts and Telegraphs. He said there was no political party in
      Russia expressing its readiness to assume full power. I reply:
      "Yes, there is. No party can refuse this, and our Party
      certainly doesn’t. It is ready to take over full power at any
      moment." (Applause and laughter.) You can laugh as much
      as you please, but if the Minister confronts us with this
      question side by side with a party of the Right, he will receive
      a suitable reply. No party can refuse this. And at a time when
      liberty still prevails, when threats of arrest and exile to
      Siberia—threats from the counter-revolutionaries with whom
      our near socialist Ministers are sharing government—are
      still no more than threats, every party says: give us your
      confidence and we shall give you our programme.
    

This programme was given by our conference on
      April 29.[2] Unfortunately,
      it is being ignored and not taken as a guide. It seems to need a
      popular exposition. I shall try to give the Minister of Posts
      and Telegraphs a popular exposition of our resolution and our
      programme. With regard to the economic crisis, our programme is
      immediately—it need not be put off—to demand the
      publication of all the fabulous profits—running as high as
      500 and 800 per cent—which the capitalists are making on
      war supplies, and not as capitalists in the open market under
      “pure” capitalism. This is where workers’ control really is
      necessary and possible. This is a

    

measure which, if you call
      yourselves “revolutionary” democrats, you should carry out in
      the name of the Congress, a measure which can be carried out
      overnight. It is not socialism. It is opening the people’s eyes
      to the real anarchy and the real playing with imperialism, the
      playing with the property of the people, with the hundreds of
      thousands of lives that tomorrow will be lost because we
      continue to throttle Greece. Make the profits of the capitalists
      public, arrest fifty or a hundred of the biggest
      millionaires. Just keep them in custody for a few weeks, if only
      in the same privileged conditions in which Nicholas Romanov is
      being held, for the simple purpose of making them reveal the
      hidden springs, the fraudulent practices, the filth and greed
      which even under the new government are costing our country
      thousands and millions every day. That is the chief cause of
      anarchy and ruin. That is why we say that everything remains as
      of old, that the coalition government hasn’t changed a thing and
      has only added a heap of declarations, of pompous
      statements. However sincere people may be, however sincerely
      they may wish the working people well, things have not
      changed—the same class remains in power. The
      policy they are pursuing is not a democratic policy.
    

You talk to us about "democratisation of the central and local
      power". Don’t you know that these words are a novelty only in
      Russia, and that elsewhere dozens of near-socialist Ministers
      have given their countries similar promises? What are they worth
      when we are faced by the real, concrete fact that while the
      population elects the authorities locally, the elementary
      principles of democracy are violated by the centre claiming the
      right to appoint or confirm the local authorities? The
      capitalists continue to plunder the people’s property. The
      imperialist war continues. And yet we are promised reforms,
      reforms and more reforms, which cannot be accomplished at all
      under these circumstances, because the war crushes and
      determines everything. Why do you disagree with those who say
      the war is not being waged over capitalist profits?
      What is the criterion? It is, first of all, which class is in
      power, which class continues to be the master, which class
      continues to make hundreds of thousands of millions from banking
      and financial operations. It is the same capitalist class and
      the war therefore continues to be

    

imperialist. Neither the first
      Provisional Government nor the government with the
      near-socialist Ministers has changed anything. The secret
      treaties remain secret. Russia is fighting for the Straits,
      fighting to continue Lyakhov’s
      policy in Persia, and so on.
    

I know you don’t want this, that most of you don’t want it, and
      that the Ministers don’t want it, because no one can want it,
      for it means the slaughter of hundreds of millions of
      people. But take the offensive which the Milyukovs and Maklakovs
      are now talking about so much. They know full well what that
      means. They know it is linked with the question of power, with
      the question of revolution. We are told we must distinguish
      between political and strategic issues. It is ridiculous to
      raise this question at all. The Cadets
      perfectly understand that the point at issue is a political
      one.
    

It is slander to say the revolutionary struggle for peace that
      has begun from below might lead to a separate peace treaty. The
      first step we should take if we had power would be to arrest the
      biggest capitalists and cut all the threads of their
      intrigues. Without this, all talk about peace without
      annexations and indemnities is utterly meaningless. Our second
      step would be to declare to all people over the head of their
      governments that we regard all capitalists as
      robbers—Tereshchenko, who is not a bit better than
      Milyukov, just a little less stupid, the French capitalists, the
      British capitalists, and all the rest.
    

Your own
      Izvestia
      has got into a muddle and proposes to keep the status
      quo instead of peace without annexations and
      indemnities. Our idea of peace "without annexations" is
      different. Even the Peasant
      Congress comes nearer the truth when it speaks of a
      “federal” republic, thereby expressing the idea that the Russian
      republic does not want to oppress any nation, either in the new
      or in the old way, and does not want to force any nation, either
      Finland or the Ukraine, with both of whom the War Minister is
      trying so hard to find fault and with whom impermissible and
      intolerable conflicts are being created. We want a single and
      undivided republic of Russia with a firm government. But a firm
      government can be secured only by the voluntary agreement of all
      people concerned. "Revolutionary democracy" are big

    

words, but
      they are being applied to a government that by its petty
      fault-finding is complicating the problem of the Ukraine and
      Finland, which do not even want to secede. They only say, "Don’t
      postpone the application of the elementary principles of
      democracy until the Constituent Assembly!”
    

A peace treaty without annexations and indemnities cannot be
      concluded until you have renounced your own annexations. It is
      ridiculous, a comedy, every worker in Europe is laughing at us,
      saying: You talk very eloquently and call on the people to
      overthrow the bankers, but you send your own bankers into the
      Ministry. Arrest them, expose their tricks, get to know the
      hidden springs! But that you don’t do although you have powerful
      organisations which cannot be resisted. You have gone through
      1905 and 1917. You know that revolution is not made to order,
      that revolutions in other countries were made by the hard and
      bloody method of insurrection, and in Russia there is no group,
      no class, that would resist the power of the Soviets. In Russia,
      this revolution can, by way of exception, be a peaceful
      one. Were this revolution to propose peace to all peoples today
      or tomorrow, by breaking with all the capitalist classes, both
      France and Germany, their people, that is, would accept very
      soon, because these countries are perishing, because Germany’s
      position is hopeless, because she cannot save herself, and
      because France—(Chairman: "Your time is up.")
    

I shall finish in half a minute. (Commotion;
      requests from the audience that the speaker continue;
      protests and applause.)
    

      (Chairman: "I inform the Congress that the Steering
      Committee proposes the speaker’s time be extended. Any
      objections? The majority are in favour of an extension.")
    

I stopped at the point that if the revolutionary democrats in
      Russia were democrats in fact and not merely in words, they
      would further the revolution and not compromise with the
      capitalists, not talk about peace without annexations and
      indemnities but abolish annexations by Russia, and declare in so
      many words that they consider all annexations criminal and
      predatory. It would then be possible to avert the imperialist
      offensive which is threatening death to thousands and millions
      of people over the partitioning of Persia and the Balkans. The
      way to peace would then be open, not an easy

    

way—we do not
      say it is easy—and one which does not preclude a truly
      revolutionary war.
    

We do not put this question as Bazarov does in today’s Novaya
      Zhizn.[3] All we say is that Russia has been placed in
      such a position that at the end of the imperialist war her tasks
      are easier than might have been expected. And her geographical
      position is such that any power would have a hard job on its
      hands if it risked using capital and its predatory interests and
      risked rising against the Russian working class and the
      semi-proletariat associated with it, i.e., the poor
      peasants. Germany is on the brink of defeat, and since the war
      was joined by the United States, which wants to swallow up
      Mexico and which tomorrow will probably start fighting Japan,
      Germany’s position has become hopeless, and she will be
      destroyed. France, who suffers more than the others because of
      her geographical position and whose state of exhaustion is
      reaching the limit—this country, while not starving as much
      as Germany, has lost infinitely more people than Germany. Now if
      the first step were to restrict the profits of the Russian
      capitalists and deprive them of all possibility of raking in
      hundreds of millions in profits, if you were to propose to all
      nations a peace treaty directed against the capitalists of all
      countries and openly declare that you will not enter into any
      negotiations or relations with the German capitalists and with
      those who abet them directly or indirectly or are involved with
      them, and that you refuse to speak with the French and British
      capitalists, then you would be acting to condemn them in the
      eyes of the workers. You would not regard it as a victory that a
      passport has been issued to
MacDonald,[4]
      a man who has never waged a revolutionary struggle against
      capital and who is being allowed to come because he has never
      expressed the ideas, principles, practice or experience of the
      revolutionary struggle against the British capitalists, a
      struggle for which our Comrade MacLean
      and hundreds of other British socialists are in prison, and for
      which our Comrade Liebknecht
      is confined to a convict prison because he said, "German
      soldiers, fire on your Kaiser!”
    

Wouldn’t it be more proper to consign the imperialist
      capitalists to that penal servitude which most of the
      Provisional Government members in an expressly reconstituted

    

      Third Duma—I don’t know, incidentally, whether it is the
      Third or the Fourth Duma—are daily preparing for us and
      promising us and about which the Ministry of Justice is already
      drafting new Bills? MacLean and Liebknecht—those are the
      names of socialists who are putting the idea of a revolutionary
      struggle against imperialism into practice. That is what we must
      say to all governments if we want to fight for peace. We must
      condemn them before their people. You will then put all the
      imperialist governments in a difficult position. But now you
      have complicated your own position by addressing your Peace
      Manifesto of March 14 to the people and saying, "Overthrow
      your tsars, your kings and your bankers!" while we who possess
      an organisation unprecedentedly rich in number, experience and
      material strength, the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies, join a bloc with our bankers, institute a coalition,
      near-socialist government, and draft the kind of reforms that
      have been drafted in Europe for decades. People there in Europe
      laugh at this kind of peace struggle. There they will understand
      it only when the Soviets take power and act in a revolutionary
      way.
    

Only one country in the world can at the moment take steps to
      stop the imperialist war on a class scale, in the face of the
      capitalists and without a bloody revolution. Only one country
      can do it, and that country is Russia. And she will remain the
      only one as long as the Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies exists. The Soviet cannot exist long side by side with
      the ordinary type of Provisional Government, and will remain
      what it is only until the offensive is taken. The offensive will
      be a turning-point in the whole policy of the Russian
      revolution, that is, it will be a transition from waiting, from
      paving the way for peace by means of a revolutionary uprising
      from below, to the resumption of the war. The path that opened
      up was transition from fraternisation on one front to
      fraternisation on every front, from spontaneous fraternisation,
      such as the exchange of a crust of bread with a hungry German
      worker for a penknife—which is punishable by penal
      servitude—to conscious fraternisation.
    

When we take power into our own hands, we shall curb the
      capitalists, and then the war will not be the kind of
      war that is being waged now, because the nature of a war is

    

      determined by what class wages it, not by what is written on
      paper. You can write on paper anything you like. But as long as
      the capitalist class has a majority in the government the war
      will remain an imperialist war no matter what you write, no
      matter how eloquent you are, no matter how many near-socialist
      Ministers you have. Everyone knows that, and everyone can see
      it. And the cases of Albania, Greece and
Persia[5] have shown
      this so clearly and graphically that I am surprised everyone is
      attacking our written declaration about the
offensive,[6] and no one
      says a word about specific cases! It is easy to promise Bills,
      but specific measures are being postponed time and again. It is
      easy to write a declaration about peace without annexations, but
      the Albanian, Greek and Persian events took place after
      the coalition Ministry was formed. After all, it was Dyelo
      Naroda,[7] not an organ of our Party, but a government
      organ, a ministerial organ, which said that it is Russian
      democracy that is being subjected to this humiliation, and that
      Greece is being strangled. And this very same Milyukov, whom you
      imagine to be heaven knows who, although he is just an ordinary
      member of his party—Tereshchenko in no way differs from
      him—wrote that the pressure exerted on Greece came from
      Allied diplomats. The war remains an imperialist war, and
      however much you may desire peace, however sincere your sympathy
      for the working people and your desire for peace—I am fully
      convinced that by and large it must be sincere—you are
      powerless, because the war can only be ended by taking the
      revolution further. When the revolution began in Russia, a
      revolutionary struggle for peace from below also began. If you
      were to take power into your hands, if power were to pass to the
      revolutionary organisations to be used for combating the Russian
      capitalists, then the working people of some countries would
      believe you and you could propose peace. Then our peace would be
      ensured at least from two sides, by the two nations who are
      being bled white and whose cause is hopeless—Germany and
      France. And if circumstances then obliged us to wage a
      revolutionary war—no one knows, and we do not rule out the
      possibility—we should say: "We are not pacifists, we do not
      renounce war when the revolutionary class is in power and has
      actually deprived the capitalists of the opportunity to
      influence things

    

in any way, to exacerbate the economic
      dislocation which enables them to make hundreds of millions."
      The revolutionary government would explain to absolutely every
      nation that every nation must be free, and that just as the
      German nation must not fight to retain Alsace and Lorraine, so
      the French nation must not fight for its colonies. For, while
      France is fighting for her colonies, Russia has Khiva and
      Bokhara, which are also something like colonies. Then the
      division of colonies will begin. And how are they to be divided?
      On what basis? According to strength. But strength has
      changed. The capitalists are in a situation where their only way
      out is war. When you take over revolutionary power, you will
      have a revolutionary way of securing peace, namely, by
      addressing a revolutionary appeal to all nations and explaining
      your tactics by your own example. Then the way to peace secured
      by revolutionary means will be open to you, and you will most
      probably be able to avert the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
      people. Then you may be certain that the German and French
      people will declare in your favour. As for the British, American
      and Japanese capitalists, even if they wanted a war against the
      revolutionary working class—whose strength will grow
      tenfold once the capitalists have been curbed and put down and
      control has passed into the hands of the working class—even
      if the American, British and Japanese capitalists wanted a war,
      the chances would be a hundred to one against them being able to
      wage it. For peace to be ensured, you will only have to declare
      that you are not pacifists, that you will defend your republic,
      your workers’, proletarian democracy, against the German, French
      and other capitalists.
    

That is why we attached such fundamental importance to our
      declaration about the offensive. The time has come for a radical
      turn in the whole history of the Russian revolution. When the
      Russian revolution began it was assisted by the imperialist
      bourgeoisie of Britain who imagined Russia to be something like
      China or India. Yet, side by side with a government in which the
      landowners and capitalists now have a majority, the Soviets
      arose, a representative institution unparalleled and
      unprecedented anywhere in the world in strength, an institution
      which you are killing by taking part in a coalition Ministry of
      the bourgeoisie. In reality,

    

the Russian revolution has made the
      revolutionary struggle from below against the capitalist
      governments welcome every where, in all countries, with three
      times as much sympathy as before. The question is one of advance
      or retreat. No one can stand still during a revolution. That is
      why the offensive is a turn in the Russian revolution, in the
      political and economic rather than the strategic sense. An
      offensive now means the continuation of the imperialist
      slaughter and the death of more hundreds of thousands, of
      millions of people—objectively, irrespective of the will or
      awareness of this or that Minister, with the aim of strangling
      Persia and other weak nations. Power transferred to the
      revolutionary proletariat, supported by the poor peasants, means
      a transition to revolutionary struggle for peace in the surest
      and most painless forms ever known to mankind, a transition to a
      state of affairs under which the power and victory of the
      revolutionary workers will be ensured in Russia and throughout
      the world. (Applause from part of the audience.)

      II

Speech On The War June 9 (22)
      

Comrades, allow me, by way of an introduction to an analysis of
      the war issue, to remind you of two passages in the Manifesto to
      all countries published by the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies on March 14. "The time has come," said the
      Manifesto, "to begin a resolute struggle against the predatory
      designs of the governments of all countries. The time has come
      for the people to take the decision on war and peace into their
      own hands." Another passage in the Manifesto, addressed to the
      workers of the Austro-German coalition, reads: "Refuse to serve
      as tools of conquest and violence in the hands of kings,
      landowners and bankers." These are the two passages that have
      been repeated in different wordings in dozens, hundreds and, I
      should even imagine, thousands of resolutions by Russia’s
      workers and peasants.
    

I am sure these two passages show best of all the contradictory
      and hopelessly complicated position in which the revolutionary
      workers and peasants find themselves owing to the present policy
      of the Mensheviks and
      Narodniks.[8]
      On the one hand, they support the war. On the other, they belong
      to classes which have no interest in the predatory designs of
      the government of any country, and they cannot help saying
      so. This psychology and ideology, much as it may be vague, is
      unusually deep-rooted in every worker and peasant. It is
      realisation that the war is being waged because of the predatory
      designs of the governments of all countries. But, together with
      this, it is very vaguely understood, or even not understood at
      all, that a government, whatever its form, expresses the
      interests of definite classes and that,

    

therefore, to contrast
      the government to the people, as the first passage I quoted
      does, is an awful theoretical muddle, utter political
      helplessness, and means condemning yourself and the whole of
      your policy to the shakiest and most unstable position and
      trend. By exactly the same token, the closing words in the
      second passage I have quoted—that excellent call, "Refuse
      to serve as tools of conquest and violence in the hands of
      kings, landowners and bankers"—are splendid. Only including
      your own, because if you Russian workers and peasants turn to
      the workers and peasants of Austria and Germany, whose
      governments and ruling classes are waging the same kind of
      predatory war of plunder as the Russian capitalists and bankers,
      and as those of Britain and France—if you say: "Refuse to
      serve as tools in the hands of your bankers" but admit your own
      bankers into the Ministry and give them a seat next to socialist
      Ministers, you are reducing all your appeals to nothing, and in
      fact you are refuting your whole policy. Your excellent
      aspirations or wishes might just as well not exist, for you are
      helping Russia to wage the very same imperialist war, the very
      same predatory war. You are coming into conflict with the masses
      you represent, because these masses will never adopt the
      capitalist point of view, openly expressed by Milyukov, Maklakov
      and others, who say: "No idea could be more criminal than that
      the war is being waged in the interests of capital.”
    

I wonder whether that idea is criminal. I have no doubt that
      from the point of view of those who half-exist today and will
      perhaps no longer exist tomorrow, the idea actually is
      criminal. But it is the only correct idea. It alone expresses
      our conception of this war. It alone expresses the interests of
      the oppressed classes as a struggle against their
      oppressors. And when we say the war is capitalist and predatory,
      we must have no illusions—there is not the slightest hint
      that the crimes of individuals, of individual kings, could have
      provoked this kind of war.
    

Imperialism is a definite stage in the development of world
      capital. Capitalism, which has been developing for decades,
      created a situation in which a small group of immensely rich
      countries—there are no more than four: Britain, France,
      Germany and the U.S.A.—amassed wealth amounting to hundreds
      of thousands of millions, and

    

concentrated vast power in the
      hands of the big banks and big capitalists—there are only a
      couple or half a dozen of them at most in each of these
      countries—immense power encompassing the whole world, and
      literally divided the whole globe territorially by setting up
      colonies. These powers had colonies in every country of the
      world. They re-divided the globe among themselves economically
      as well, because concessions, and the threads of finance
      capital, penetrated into every single part of the globe. This is
      the basis for annexations. Annexations are not a figment of the
      imagination. They did not arrive because people who loved
      liberty unexpectedly became reactionaries. Annexations are
      nothing but a political expression and political form of the
      domination of giant banks that has arisen inevitably from
      capitalism, through no one’s fault, because shares are the basis
      of banks and because the accumulation of shares is the basis of
      imperialism. And the big banks, which dominate the whole world
      through hundreds and thousands of millions in capital and link
      entire industries with capitalist and monopoly
      alliances—that is where we have imperialism, which has
      split the whole world into three groups of immensely rich
      plunderers.
    

One group—the first, which is closer to us in
      Europe—is headed by Britain, and the other two, by Germany
      and the U.S.A. The other accomplices are compelled to help while
      capitalist relations persist. Therefore, if you have a clear
      idea of the essence of the matter, which every oppressed person
      realises instinctively and which every Russian worker and the
      vast majority of peasants realise instinctively—if you have
      a clear idea of it, you will see how laughable is the idea of
      fighting the war with words, manifestos, leaflets and socialist
      congresses. It is laughable because the banks are still
      omnipotent no matter how many declarations you issue, no matter
      how many political revolutions you carry out—you have
      overthrown Nicholas Romanov in Russia and have to some extent
      made her a republic; Russia has taken a gigantic stride forward,
      and may be said to have overtaken, almost overnight, France,
      which in different conditions required a hundred years to do as
      much and yet remained a capitalist country. And the capitalists
      are still there. They have lost some ground. They did so in 1905
      as well, but did that

undermine their strength? While this may
      be new to Russians, in Europe every revolution showed that with
      every upswing of the revolutionary movement the workers achieved
      something more than they had before, but capitalist power
      remained. The struggle against the imperialist war is impossible
      unless it is a struggle waged by the revolutionary classes
      against the ruling classes on a world scale. It is not a
      question of landowners in general. There are landowners in
      Russia and they play a greater role in Russia than in any other
      country but they are not the class which brought imperialism
      into being. It is a question of the capitalist class led by the
      biggest finance magnates and banks, and there will be no way out
      of this war until this class, which dominates the oppressed
      workers allied with the poor peasants, the semi-proletarians, as
      our programme calls them, until this class is overthrown. The
      illusion that you can unite the working people of the world by
      leaflets and appeals to other nations can only come from the
      narrow Russian outlook, ignorant of how the press in Western
      Europe, where the workers and peasants are used to political
      revolutions and have seen dozens of them, laughs at such phrases
      and appeals. They don’t know that the mass of workers has
      actually risen in Russia, where most of the workers are
      absolutely sincere in their faith and condemn the predatory
      designs of the capitalists of every country and want to see the
      people freed from the bankers. But they, the Europeans, cannot
      understand why you, who have an organisation which no one else
      on earth has, the Soviets of Workers’, Peasants’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies, which are armed—why you make Ministers of your
      socialists. After all, you are handing power to the
      bankers. People abroad accuse you not only of
      naïveté—this is not the worst—Europeans can no
      longer understand naïveté in politics, they cannot
      understand that there are tens of millions of people in Russia
      who are stirring to life for the first time, and that people in
      Russia know nothing of the link between the classes and the
      government, of the link between the government and war. War is a
      continuation of bourgeois politics, nothing else. The ruling
      class shapes the country’s policy in war-time as well. War is
      politics from beginning to end. It is pursuit of the same old
      aims by these classes using a different method. That is why,
      when you write in your workers’ and peasants’ appeals

    

“overthrow
      your bankers", every politically-conscious worker in a European
      country either laughs at you or cries bitterly over you, saying
      to himself: "What can we do since people there have overthrown a
      half-savage idiot and monster of a monarch, the kind we did away
      with a long time ago—this is the only crime we have
      committed—and now, with their ’near-socialist’ Ministers,
      they back the Russian bankers?!”
    

The bankers remain in power. They pursue a foreign policy
      through an imperialist war, fully supporting the treaties
      concluded by Nicholas II in Russia. This is particularly evident
      in our country. All the principles of Russia’s imperialist
      foreign policy were predetermined not by the present day
      capitalists, but by the previous government and Nicholas Romanov
      whom we have overthrown. He concluded those treaties, they
      remain secret, and the capitalists cannot publish them because
      they are capitalists. But no worker or peasant can see his way
      clear of this tangle because he tells himself: "Since we call
      for the overthrow of the capitalists in other countries, we must
      first of all get rid of our own bankers, otherwise nobody will
      believe in us and nobody will take us seriously. People will say
      we are naïve Russian savages who put on paper words that are
      excellent in themselves but lack political substance, or, worse
      still, they will think us hypocrites. You would see these things
      in the foreign press if that press, every shade of it, passed
      freely into Russia across the frontier instead of being stopped
      by the British and French authorities at Tornea. You would see
      from a mere selection of quotations from foreign newspapers the
      glaring contradiction in which you find yourselves. You would
      see how incredibly ridiculous and erroneous is this idea of
      fighting the war with socialist-conferences, with agreements
      with the socialists at congresses. Had imperialism been the
      fault or crime of individuals, socialism could remain
      socialism. Imperialism is the final stage of capitalism’s
      development, a stage at which it has gone as far as to divide
      the whole world, and two gigantic groups are locked in a
      life-and-death struggle. You must serve one group or the other,
      or overthrow both groups. There is no other way. When you reject
      a separate peace treaty, saying you don’t want to serve the
      German imperialists, you are perfectly right, and that is why
      we, too, are against a separate peace treaty. Yet in effect, and
      in

    

spite of yourselves, you continue to serve the Anglo-French
      imperialists, who have predatory designs of the kind that the
      Russian capitalists have translated into treaties with the aid
      of Nicholas Romanov. We do not know the texts of those treaties,
      but anyone who has followed political writing and has glanced
      through at least one book on economics or diplomacy must be
      familiar with the content of the treaties. Moreover, as far as I
      can remember, Milyukov wrote in his books about those treaties
      and promises that they would plunder Galicia, the Straits and
      Armenia, retain what they had annexed earlier and get plenty of
      other territories. Everyone knows that, but still the treaties
      are kept secret, and we are told that if we annul them it will
      mean breaking with our Allies.
    

With regard to a separate peace treaty, I have already said
      there can be no separate peace treaty for us, and our Party
      resolution leaves not the slightest room for doubt that we
      reject it as we reject all agreement with the capitalists. To
      us, a separate peace treaty means coming to terms with the
      German plunderers, because they are plundering in the same way
      as the others. Coming to terms with Russian capital within the
      Russian Provisional Government is the same kind of separate
      peace treaty. The tsarist treaties remain, and they, too, help
      to plunder and strangle other peoples. When it is said, "Peace
      without annexations and indemnities", as every worker and every
      peasant in Russia should say because life teaches him so,
      because he has no interest in bank profits and because he wants
      to live, I reply: Your leaders in the present Soviet of Workers’
      and Soldiers’ Deputies from the Narodnik and Menshevik parties
      have become tangled up in that slogan. They have said in their
      Izvestia that it means retaining the status
      quo, that is, the pre-war state of affairs, going back to
      what existed before the war. Isn’t that capitalist peace? And
      what capitalist peace, too! Since you are putting forward that
      slogan, you must remember that the course of events may bring
      your parties to power. That is possible during a revolution, and
      you will have to do what you say. But if you propose peace
      without annexations now, the Germans will accept and the British
      will not, because the British capitalists have not lost an inch
      of territory but have grabbed plenty in every part of the

    

      world. The Germans grabbed a lot too, but they also lost a lot,
      and not only lost a lot but found themselves up against the
      U.S.A., a most formidable enemy. If you who propose peace
      without annexations mean retaining the status quo, you
      are drifting into a situation in which your proposal will
      produce a separate peace treaty with the capitalists, because,
      if you propose that, the German capitalists, being faced by the
      U.S.A. and Italy with whom they signed treaties in the past,
      will say: "We shall accept that peace treaty without
      annexations. It will not be a defeat for us, it will be victory
      over the U.S.A. and Italy." Objectively, you are drifting into
      the same kind of separate peace treaty with the capitalists
      which you accuse us of, because fundamentally you are not
      breaking—in your policy, in reality, in your practical
      moves—with those bankers expressing imperialist domination
      all over the world whom you and your “socialist” Ministers
      support in the Provisional Government.
    

You are thereby creating a contradictory and precarious
      situation for yourselves in which the masses misunderstand
      you. The masses, who have no interest in annexations, say: "We
      refuse to fight for any capitalist’s sake." When we are told
      that this sort of policy can be ended by means of congresses and
      agreements among the socialists of the world, we reply: "It
      probably could, if only imperialism were the handiwork of
      individual criminals; but imperialism is an outgrowth of world
      capitalism with which the working-class movement is connected.”
    

Imperialism’s victory is the beginning of an inevitable,
      unavoidable split of the socialists of all countries into two
      camps. Anyone who keeps on talking about the socialists as an
      integral body, as something that can be integral, is deceiving
      himself and others. The entire course of the war, the two and a
      half years of it, has been leading to this split—ever since
      the Basle
      Manifesto, signed unanimously, which said that imperialist
      capitalism was at the root of this war. The Basle Manifesto does
      not say a word about "defence of the fatherland". No other
      manifesto could have been written before the war, just as today
      no socialist would propose writing a manifesto about "defence of
      the fatherland" in the war between Japan and the U.S.A., in
      which it is not a matter of risking his own skin, his own
      capitalists and his

    

own Ministers. Draft a resolution for
      international congresses! You know that war between Japan and
      the U.S.A. is a foregone conclusion. This war has been brewing
      for decades. It is no accident. Tactics do not depend on who
      fires the first shot. That is ridiculous. You know very well
      that Japanese and U.S. capitalism are equally predatory. There
      will be talk about "defence of the fatherland" on both sides. It
      will be a crime or an indication of terrible weakness due to the
      “defence” of the interests of our capitalist enemies. That is
      why we say that socialism has been split irrevocably. The
      socialists have completely departed from socialism—or
      rather, those who have deserted to their government, their
      bankers and their capitalists, no matter what they may say
      against them and however much they may condemn
      them. Condemnation is beside the point. Sometimes, however,
      condemnation of the Germans’ backing for their capitalists
      covers up defence of the same “sin” by the Russians! If you
      accuse the German social-chauvinists, i.e., people who are
      socialists in words—many of them may well be socialists at
      heart—but chauvinists in fact, people who actually defend
      the dirty, selfish and predatory German capitalists rather than
      the German people, then don’t defend the British, French and
      Russian capitalists. The German social-chauvinists are no worse
      than those in our Ministry who continue the policy of secret
      treaties, of plunder, and cover this up with pious wishes in
      which there is much that is kind, and which I admit are
      absolutely sincere from the point of view of the masses, but in
      which I do not and cannot see a single word of political
      truth. It is merely your wish, while the war remains as
      imperialist and is being waged for the same secret treaties as
      ever! You are calling on other peoples to overthrow the bankers,
      yet you are backing your own! When you spoke of peace, you did
      not say what peace. No one answered us when we pointed out the
      glaring contradiction in a peace treaty on the basis of the
      status quo. In your resolution, speaking of peace
      without annexations, you cannot say that it will not mean
      retaining the status quo. You cannot say that it will
      mean retaining the status quo, that is, restoration of
      the pre-war state of affairs. What will it be, then? Taking the
      German colonies away from Britain? Try that through peaceful
      agreements! Everyone will laugh

    

at you. Try to take away from
      Japan, without a revolution, Kiaochow or the Pacific islands she
      has grabbed!
    

You have got yourselves mixed up in hopeless
      contradictions. When we say "without annexations", we mean that
      this slogan is only a subordinate part of the struggle against
      world imperialism. We say we want to liberate all peoples and
      begin with our own. You talk of war against annexations and of
      peace without annexations, but in Russia you continue the policy
      of annexations. That’s simply ridiculous. You and your
      government, your new Ministers, actually continue the policy of
      annexations in regard to Finland and the Ukraine. You find fault
      with the Ukrainian congress and, through your Ministers,
      prohibit its
sittings.[9] Isn’t that annexation? It amounts to a
      mockery of the rights of a nationality which was tormented by
      the tsars because its children wanted to speak their mother
      tongue. That means being afraid of separate republics. From the
      point of view of the workers and peasants, there is nothing
      terrible about that. Let Russia be a union of free
      republics. The workers and peasants will not fight to prevent
      that. Let every nation be free, and first of all let all the
      nationalities with which you are making the revolution in Russia
      be free. By not taking that step, you are condemning yourselves
      to being "revolutionary democrats" in words while your entire
      policy is in fact counter-revolutionary.
    

Your foreign policy is anti-democratic and
      counter-revolutionary. A revolutionary policy may mean you have
      to wage a revolutionary war. But that is not inevitable. This
      point has been dealt with at length by the main speaker, and
      lately by the newspapers as well. I should very much like to
      dwell on this point.
    

What is the practical way out of this war as we see it? We say:
      the way out of this war lies only through revolution. Support
      the revolution of the classes oppressed by the capitalists,
      overthrow the capitalist class in your country and thereby set
      an example to other countries. That alone is socialism. That
      alone means fighting the war. Everything else is empty promises,
      phrase-mongering or pious wishes. Socialism has been split all
      over the world. You continue to confuse things by associating
      with socialists who back their governments. You forget that in
      Britain and Germany, the

    

true socialists, who express the
      socialism of the masses, are isolated and have been thrown into
      gaol. Yet they alone express the interests of the proletarian
      movement. But what if in Russia the oppressed class found itself
      in power? When asked how we shall break out of the war by
      ourselves, we answer: you cannot break out of it by
      yourself. All our Party resolutions and all speakers at our
      public meetings call it absurd to say you can break out of this
      war by yourself. This war involves hundreds of millions of
      people and hundreds of thousands of millions in capital. The
      only way out is the transfer of power to the revolutionary class
      which must really break imperialism, its financial, banking and
      annexationist threads. Until this happens nothing will have been
      done. The revolution was limited to your getting, in place of
      tsarism and imperialism, a near-republic which is imperialist
      through and through and which cannot treat Finland and the
      Ukraine democratically, i.e., without being afraid of division,
      even through revolutionary worker and peasant representatives.
    

It is untrue to say that we are seeking a separate peace
      treaty. We say: No separate peace treaty with any capitalists,
      least of all with the Russian capitalists. But the Provisional
      Government has a separate peace treaty with the Russian
      capitalists. Down with that separate peace treaty!
      (Applause.) We recognise no separate peace treaty with
      the German capitalists and we shall not enter into any
      negotiations. Nor must there be a separate peace treaty with the
      British and French imperialists. We are told that to break with
      them would mean coming to terms with the German
      imperialists. That is not true. We must break with them
      immediately because it is an alliance for plunder. It is said
      that the treaties cannot be published because that would mean
      showing up the whole of our government and the whole of our
      policy in the eyes of every worker and peasant. If we were to
      publish these treaties and plainly tell the Russian workers and
      peasants at meetings, especially in every remote hamlet: "What
      you are now fighting for is the Straits, and because they want
      to keep Armenia," they would all say: "We want no such war."
      (The Chairman: "Your time is up." Voices: "Let
      him speak.") I ask for ten minutes more. (Voices: "Let
      him speak.")
    
 

I say that this contrast—"either with the British or with
      the German imperialists"—is wrong. It implies that if we
      make peace with the German imperialists we must fight the
      British, and vice versa. This contrasting suits those who are
      not breaking with their capitalists and bankers, and who accept
      any alliance with them. But it doesn’t suit us. We speak of our
      defending the alliance with the oppressed class, with the
      oppressed people. Remain loyal to this alliance, and then you
      will be revolutionary democrats. It’s no easy task. This task
      will not let you forget that under certain circumstances we
      shall be unable to do without a revolutionary war. No
      revolutionary class can rule out revolutionary war, or it will
      doom itself to ridiculous pacifism. We are not Tolstoyans. If
      the revolutionary class takes power, if its state keeps no
      annexed territories, and if no power is left to the banks and
      big capital, which is not easy to do in Russia, then that class
      will be waging a revolutionary war in reality and not merely in
      words. You cannot rule out this kind of war. That would mean
      succumbing to the Tolstoyan philosophy and to philistinism,
      forgetting the whole of Marxist science and the experience of
      all European revolutions.
    

You cannot pull Russia alone out of the war. But she is winning
      more and more great allies who do not believe you now because
      your attitude is contradictory or naïve, and because you
      advise other peoples to "end annexations" while introducing them
      in your own country. You tell other peoples to overthrow the
      bankers. Yet you do not overthrow your own. Try another
      policy. Publish the treaties and show them up in front of every
      worker and peasant and at public meetings Say: No peace with the
      German capitalists, and a complete break with the Anglo-French
      capitalists. Let the British get out of Turkey and stop fighting
      for Baghdad. Let them get out of India and Egypt. We refuse to
      fight for the retention of booty that has been seized, just as
      we shall not put an ounce of energy into helping the German
      plunderers to keep their booty. If you do that—so far you
      have only talked about it, and in politics words are not
      credited, which is just as well—if you do that,
      and talk about it, then the allies you now have will show what
      they can do. Think of the mood of every oppressed worker and
      peasant. They sympathise with you and regret that you are so
      weak you leave the

    

bankers alone even though you have arms. It
      is the oppressed workers of the world that are your allies. It
      will be just what the revolution of 1905 showed in practice. It
      was tremendously weak at first. But what is its international
      effect? How did that policy, and the history of 1905, shape the
      foreign policy of the Russian revolution? Today you are
      conducting the Russian revolution’s whole foreign policy with
      the capitalists. Yet 1905 showed what the Russian revolution’s
      foreign policy should be like. It is an indisputable fact that
      October 17,
1905,[10] was followed by mass unrest and
      barricade-building in the streets of Vienna and Prague. After
      1905 came 1908 in Turkey, 1909 in Persia and 1910 in
China.[11] If, instead of
      compromising with the capitalists, you call on the truly
      revolutionary democrats, the working class, the oppressed, you
      will have as allies the oppressed classes instead of the
      oppressors, and the nationalities which are now being rent to
      pieces instead of the nationalities in which the oppressing
      classes now temporarily predominate.
    

We have been reminded of the German front where the only change
      we proposed is the unrestricted dissemination of our appeals
      written in Russian on one side of the sheet and German on the
      reverse. In them we say: The capitalists of both countries are
      robbers. To get them out of the way would be merely a step
      towards peace. But there are other fronts. I don’t know how
      strong our army is on the Turkish front. Let us assume it is
      roughly three million strong. It would be better if that army,
      which is now kept in Armenia and is carrying out annexations
      that you tolerate while preaching peace without annexations to
      other peoples, although you have strength and authority—if
      that army adopted this programme, and if it made Armenia an
      independent Armenian republic and gave her the money which the
      financiers of Britain and France take from us.
    

It is said that we cannot do without the financial support of
      Britain and France. But this support “supports” us like the rope
      supporting a hanged man. Let the Russian revolutionary class
      say: down with that support, I refuse to recognise debts
      contracted with the French and British capitalists, and I call
      for a general revolt against the capitalists. No peace treaty
      with the German capitalists and no alliance with the British and
      French! If this policy were actually pursued,

    

our army fighting
      the Turks could be released and sent to other fronts, because
      all Asian peoples would see that the Russian people do not
      merely proclaim peace without annexations on the basis of
      self-determination but that the Russian worker and peasant are
      in fact placing themselves at the head of all oppressed
      nationalities, and that with them, the struggle against
      imperialism is not a pious wish nor a high-flown ministerial
      phrase but a matter of vital concern to the revolution.
    

As we stand now, a revolutionary war may threaten us, but this
      war is not bound to take place, since the British imperialists
      will hardly be able to wage war against us if you act as a
      practical example to the peoples surrounding Russia. Prove that
      you are liberating the Armenian republic and reaching agreement
      with the Soviets of Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies in every
      country, that you are for a free republic, and then the Russian
      revolution’s foreign policy will become really revolutionary and
      really democratic. At present it is that only in words. In
      reality it is counter-revolutionary, because you are bound hand
      and foot by the Anglo-French imperialists and refuse to say so
      openly, you are afraid to admit it. Instead of issuing that
      appeal "to overthrow foreign bankers", you would have done
      better to tell the Russian people, the workers and peasants, in
      so many words: "We are too weak, we cannot throw off the tyranny
      of the Anglo-French imperialists, we are their slaves and are
      therefore fighting." It would have been a bitter truth that
      would have been of revolutionary significance. It would actually
      have brought this predatory war closer to its end. That means a
      thousand times more than an agreement with the French and
      British social-chauvinists, than the convening of congresses
      which they would agree to attend, than the continuation of this
      policy by which you are actually afraid to break with the
      imperialists of one country while remaining the allies of
      another. You can draw on the support of the oppressed classes of
      Europe, of the oppressed people of the weaker countries which
      Russia strangled under the tsars and which she is still
      strangling now, as she is strangling Armenia. With their
      support, you can bring freedom by helping their workers’ and
      peasants’ committees. You would put yourselves at the head of
      all the oppressed classes, all

    

oppressed peoples, in the war
      against the German and British imperialists, who cannot join
      forces against you because they are locked in a life-and-death
      struggle against each other, and because they are in a hopeless
      position, in which the Russian revolution’s foreign policy, a
      sincere and real alliance with the oppressed classes, the
      oppressed peoples, can be successful it has 99 chances in 100 of
      being successful!
    

Recently we read in our Moscow Party newspaper a letter from a
      peasant commenting on our programme. I should like to bring my
      speech to a close with a brief quotation from that letter,
      showing what a peasant makes of our programme. The letter was
      printed in No. 59 of 
Sotsial-Demokrat,our
      Moscow Party newspaper, and was reprinted in Pravda
      No. 68.[12]


      “We must," says the letter, "press the bourgeoisie harder to
      make them burst at the seams. Then the war will be over. But
      things will turn out badly if we don’t press the bourgeoisie
      hard enough." (Applause.)

K. Marx and F. Engels, Selected Correspondence, Moscow, 1965,
p. 395.




[2]
Lenin is referring to the resolutions of the Seventh (April)
All-Russia Conference of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.), held in Petrograd from
April 24 to 29 (May 7–12), 1917 (see The C.P.S.U. in Resolutions
and Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of
the C.C., 7th ed., Part I, 1954, pp. 332–53 [in Russian]).




[3]
Novaya Zhizn (New Life)—a daily newspaper of a Menshevik trend
published by a group of Social-Democrats who called themselves
“internationalists”. The group comprised the Mensheviks who
supported Martov, and certain intellectuals with semi-Menshevik
leanings. It vacillated continuously between the conciliators and
the Bolsheviks.

Novaya Zhizn appeared in Petrograd from April 1917. After
the October Revolution it adopted a hostile attitude to the Soviet
state. It was closed down in July 1918.





[4]
Lenin has in mind the British Government issuing a passport
to Ramsay MacDonald, the British Independent Labour Party
leader, who was invited to Russia by the Executive Committee
of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. The
trip was frustrated by the British Seamen’s Union, which refused
to man the ship in which MacDonald was to sail to Russia.





[5]
In June 1917 Italy overran Albania and proclaimed her
independence under Italy’s virtual protectorate.

In Greece, a coup d’état was carried out under the pressure of
Britain and France. By launching an economic blockade that caused
a terrible famine, and by occupying a number of Greek provinces,
the Allies forced King Constantine to abdicate, and put Venizelos,
their adherent, in power. Greece was dragged into the war on the
side of the Entente, contrary to the will of the vast majority of
her people.

During the First World War Persia (Iran) was occupied by
British and Russian troops. By early 1917 Persia, having lost all
independence, was occupied by the Russians in the north and the
British in the south.

Provisional Government diplomats backed all these acts of
imperialist tyranny.





[6]
Reference is to the declaration which the bureau of the Bolshevik
group and the bureau of the united internationalist Social–
Democrats made at the First All-Russia Congress of Soviets. They
demanded that the Congress first of all discuss the offensive at the front
for which the Provisional Government was preparing. The
declaration pointed out that the offensive was being imposed by the
magnates of the imperialist Allies and that the Russian
counter-revolutionaries expected thereby to concentrate power in the hands
of the military-diplomatic and capitalist groups, and to deliver
a blow to the revolutionary fight for peace and to the positions
gained by the Russian democrats. The declaration warned the
working class, the armed forces and the peasants of the danger
threatening the country, and called on the Congress to immediately repel
the counter-revolutionaries’ onslaught.

The Congress rejected the proposal made by the bureau of the
R.S.D.L.P.(B.) group.





[7]
Dyelo Naroda (People’s Cause)—an S.R. daily published in
Petrograd between March 1917 and Juno 1918. It changed its title several
times. It adopted a defencist and conciliatory stand and supported
the bourgeois Provisional Government. Its publication was resumed
in Samara in October 1918 (three issues were brought out) and in

   

Moscow in March 1919 (ten issues). The paper was closed down the
same year for its counter-revolutionary trend.





[8]
Lenin described as Narodniks three petty-bourgeois parties of
a Narodnik type: the Trudoviks, Socialist-Revolutionaries and
Popular Socialists.





[9]
Allusion is to the prohibition of the All-Ukraine Army Congress
by Kerensky, the Provisional Government’s War Minister. Despite
the ban, the Congress sat from June 5–12 (18–25), 1917, in Kiev.
It was attended by some 2,000 delegates. It passed the “Universal
Act” on the autonomy of the Ukraine, published by the Ukrainian
Central Rada.

The counter-revolutionary policies of the Provisional
Government and the Menshevik and S.R. parties towards the Ukraine were
denounced by Lenin in the articles “The Ukraine” and “The Ukraine
and the Defeat of the Ruling Parties of Russia” (see pp. 91–92 and
99–102 of this volume).





[10]
Reference is to the tsar’s Manifesto of October 17, 1905, promising
“civil liberties” and a “legislative” Duma. The Manifesto was
a concession wrested from the tsarist regime by the revolution.
The autocracy wanted to gain time, split the revolutionary forces,
foil the All-Russia Strike and crush the revolution. The Bolsheviks
exposed this political manoeuvre. On October 18 (31), 1905, the
C.C. R.S.D.L.P. issued the appeal “To the Russian People”
revealing the spurious character of the tsar’s Manifesto and calling on
the working people to continue their revolutionary struggle.





[11]
The Russian revolution of 1905–07 gave rise to revolutionary
movements among the peoples of the East. In 1908 a bourgeois revolution
broke out in Turkey. In 1900 there was a bourgeois revolution
in Persia, resulting in the overthrow of the shah in 1909. The year
1910 saw the rise of a revolutionary movement in China against
the feudal lords and foreign imperialists. The movement led to
a revolution, and to the establishment of a bourgeois republic
in December 1911.





[12]
Pravda (The Truth)—a Bolshevik daily newspaper published
legally. Its first issue appeared in St. Petersburg on April 22 (May 5),
1912.

Lenin, who guided Pravda ideologically, contributed to the
paper almost daily. He gave recommendations to its editors with
a view to making it a militant revolutionary paper.

A substantial part of the Party’s organising work was done
through Pravda, Conferences with representatives of local Party
cells were held in its offices, which also received information on
Party work in factories and passed on directives of the Party’s
Central and Petrograd Committees.

Pravda was doggedly persecuted by the police and was closed
down on July 8 (21), 1914.

It did not resume publication until after the February
bourgeois-democratic revoluion of 1917. =

From March 5 (18), 1917, onwards
it was brought out as a paper of the Central and Petrograd
Committees of the R.S.D.L.P.

Upon his arrival in Petrograd Lenin joined the editorial board,
and Pravda launched a campaign for his plan to bring about the
development of the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist
revolution.

From July to October 1917 the paper, being persecuted by the
counter-revolutionary Provisional Government, had to change its
title more than once. It appeared as Listok “Pravdy”, Proletary,
Rabochy and Rabochy Put. Since the victory of the October Socialist
Revolution it has been published—beginning with October 27
(November 9), 1917—under its original title, Pravda.

Pravda holds a prominent place in the history of the Bolshevik
press. The generation of advanced workers it educated played
an outstanding part in the October Revolution and in socialist
construction. Pravda was the first mass paper of the working class to
be published legally. It marked a new stage in the development
of the press of Russia’s working class and the world proletariat.

The day when the first issue of Pravda appeared has been
celebrated as the workers’ Press Day ever since 1914.

In one way or another, June 18 will go down as a turning-point
      in the history of the Russian revolution.
    

The mutual position of the classes, their correlation in the
      struggle against each other, their strength, particularly in
      comparison with the strength of the parties, were all revealed
      so distinctly, so strikingly, so impressively by last Sunday’s
      demonstration that, whatever the course and pace of further
      development, the gain in political awareness and clarity has
      been tremendous.
    

The demonstration in a few hours scattered to the winds, like a
      handful of dust, the empty talk about Bolshevik conspirators
      and showed with the utmost clarity that the vanguard of the
      working people of Russia, the industrial proletariat of the
      capital, and the overwhelming majority of the troops support
      slogans that our Party has always advocated.
    

The measured step of the battalions of workers and
      soldiers. Nearly half a million demonstrators. A concerted
      onslaught. Unity around the slogans, among which overwhelmingly
      predominated: “All power to the Soviets”,
      “Down with the ten capitalist Ministers”,
      “Neither a separate peace treaty with the Germans nor
      secret treaties with the Anglo-French capitalists”,
      etc. No one who saw the demonstration has any doubt left about
      the victory of these slogans among the organised vanguard of
      Russia’s workers and soldiers.
    

The demonstration of June 18 was a demonstration of the strength
      and policy of the revolutionary proletariat, which is showing
      the direction for the revolution and indicating the way out of
      the impasse. This is the tremendous historical significance of
      last Sunday’s demonstration,

    

and its essential difference from
      the demonstrations

      during the funeral of the victims of the revolution and on May
      Day. Then it was a universal tribute to the
      revolution’s first victory and to its heroes. The people looked
      back over the first stage of the road to freedom, which they had
      passed very rapidly and very successfully. May Day was a
      holiday of hopes and aspirations linked with the
      history of the world labour movement and with its ideal of peace
      and socialism.
    

Neither of the two demonstrations was intended to point the
      direction for the revolution’s further development, nor
      could it do so. Neither demonstration put before the people, or
      raised in the name of the people, specific, definite and urgent
      questions as to how and in what
      direction the revolution should proceed.
    

In this sense, June 18 was the first political demonstration of
      action, an explanation of how the various classes act,
      how they want to and will act, in order to further the
      revolution—an explanation not given in a book or
      newspaper,
      but on the streets, not through leaders, but through the people.
    

The bourgeoisie kept out of the way. They refused to participate
      in that peaceful demonstration of a dear majority of
      the people, in which there was freedom of party slogans, and the
      chief aim of which was to protest against counter
      revolution. That is natural. The bourgeoisie are the
      counter-revolution. They hide from the people. They organise
      real
      counter-revolutionary conspiracies against the people. The
      parties now ruling Russia, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
      Mensheviks, clearly showed themselves on that historic day, June
      18, as waverers. Their slogans spoke of wavering, and it was
      obvious to all that the supporters of their slogans were in a
      minority. By their slogans and wavering they advised
      the people to remain where they were, to leave everything
      unchanged for the time being. And the people felt, and they
      themselves felt, that that was impossible.
    

Enough of wavering, said the vanguard of the proletariat, the
      vanguard of Russia’s workers and soldiers. Enough of
      wavering. The policy of trust in the capitalists, in
      their government, in their vain attempts at
      reform, in their war, in their policy of an
      offensive, is a hopeless policy. Its collapse is imminent. Its
      collapse is inevitable. And that

    

collapse will also be the
      collapse of the ruling parties, the Socialist-Revolutionaries
      and the Mensheviks. Economic disruption
      is coming nearer. There is no escaping it except by the
      revolutionary measures of the revolutionary class which has
      taken power.
    

Let the people break with the policy of trust in the
      capitalists. Let them put their trust in the revolutionary
      class—the proletariat. The source of power lies in it and only
      in it, It alone is the pledge that the interests of the
      majority will be served, the interests of the working
      and exploited people, who, though held down by war an  capital,
      are capable of defeating war and capital!
    

A crisis of unprecedented scale has descended upon Russia and
      the whole of humanity. The only way out is to put trust in the
      most organised and advanced contingent of the working and
      exploited people, and support its policy.
    

We do not know whether the people will grasp this lesson soon or
      how they will put it into effect. But we do know for certain
      that apart from this lesson there is no way out of the impasse,
      that possible waverings or brutalities on the part of the
      counter-revolutionaries will lead nowhere.
    

There is no way out unless the masses put complete confidence
      in their leader, the proletariat.

## What Could the Cadets Have Counted On When They Withdrew From the Cabinet?

The question arises quite naturally. To correctly meet events
      with definite tactics, we must understand them correctly. How,
      then, are we to understand the Cadet withdrawal?
    

Spite? Disagreement in principle over the Ukraine? Of course
      not. It would be ridiculous to suspect the Cadets of loyalty to
      principles, or the bourgeoisie of the ability to do something
      out of spite.
    

The Cadet withdrawal can only be understood as a calculated
      move. What are their calculations?
    

To govern a country which has carried out a major revolution
      and is still in a state of unrest, and to govern it during a
      world-wide imperialist war, you need the initiative and scope of
      a truly revolutionary class—massively courageous,
      historically great, wholeheartedly enthusiastic. Either you
      suppress this class by force, as the Cadets have been preaching
      for some time, since May 6 in fact, or you entrust your self to
      its leadership. Either you are in alliance with imperialist
      capital, then you must take the offensive, you must be an
      obedient servant of capital, you must sell yourself to it, you
      must throw overboard the utopian ideas of abolishing landed
      property without compensation (see Birzhevka for Lvov’s
      speeches against Chernov’s programme); or you are against
      imperialist capital, then you must immediately propose precise
      peace terms to all nations, because they have all been exhausted
      by the war, you must dare to raise, and be able to raise, the
      banner of world proletarian revolution against capital, and to
      do so not in words but in deeds, to
      further the revolution with the greatest determination in Russia
      herself.
    
 

The Cadets are wily businessmen in trade, in finance, in
      safeguarding capital, as well as in politics. They have
      correctly taken into account the fact that the situation is
      objectively a revolutionary one. They agree to reforms
      and
      enjoy sharing power with the reformists, the Tseretelis and
      Chernovs. But reforms will not help. There is no way
      out of
      the crisis, the war and economic disruption, through reforms.
    

From their class point of view, from the imperialist exploiters’
      point of view, the Cadets have calculated correctly. They seem
      to say: “By withdrawing, we present an ultimatum. We know
      that at present the Tseretelis and Chernovs do not trust the
      truly revolutionary class, that at present they do not want to
      conduct a truly revolutionary policy. Let’s frighten them. To be
      without the Cadets means being without the ’aid’ of world-wide
      Anglo-American capital, means raising the banner of revolution
      against the latter as well. The Tseretelis and Chernovs
      wouldn’t do that, they wouldn’t dare! They will give in to us!
    

      “If not, then even if a revolution against capital starts,
      it will fail and we shall come back.”
    

That is how the Cadets calculate. We repeat: from the point of
      view of the exploiting class, their calculations are correct.
    

Were the Tseretelis and Chernovs to take the point of view of
      the exploited class and not that of the vacillating petty
      bourgeoisie, they would reply to the Cadets’ correct
      calculations by correct adherence to the revolutionary
      proletariat’s policy.
    

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
On July 2 (15), hearing of the miscarriage of the Juno offensive,
the Cadet Ministers Shingaryov, Manuilov and Shakhovskoi resigned
from the coalition Provisional Government on the pretext that
they disagreed with the government’s stand on the Ukrainian
question. In a declaration to the Ukrainian Central Rada, the
Provisional Government had promised to appoint by mutual
agreement a General Secretariat to administer the Ukraine, while
   

the Cadets insisted that the Ukrainian question be settled solely
by the Constituent Assembly.

The true reason for the Cadets’ resignation was their desire
to provoke a government crisis with an eye to bringing pressure
to bear on the “socialist” Ministers and securing their consent to
a Cadet counter-revolutionary programme: the disarming of the
Red Guards, withdrawal of the revolutionary troops from
Petrograd, and prohibition of the Bolshevik Party.

This question is usually answered quite simply: there is no
      counter-revolution at all or we do not know where it is. But we
      know full well where power is. It is in the hands of the
      Provisional Government, which is controlled by the Central
      Executive Committee (C.E.C.) of the All-Russia Congress of
      Soviets of Soldiers’ and Workers’ Deputies. This is the usual
      answer.
    

Yesterday’s political
      crisis,[1]
      like most types of
      crises, which tear down everything conventional and shatter all
      illusions, left in its wake the ruins of the illusions expressed
      in the usual answers—cited above—to the basic
      questions of any revolution.
    

There is a former member of the Second Duma, Alexinsky, whom the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks,
      the ruling parties in the Soviets of Workers’,
      Soldiers’ and Peas ants’ Deputies, refused to admit on
      to the Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workers’ and
      Soldiers’ Deputies until he rehabilitated himself,
      i.e., until he redeemed his
      honour.[2]


What was the trouble? Why did the Executive Committee publicly
      and formally deny Alexinsky its confidence, demanding that he
      redeem his honour, i.e., declaring him dishonest?
    

It was because Alexinsky had made himself so notorious by
      libellous statements that he had been branded a slanderer in
      Paris by journalists of the most diverse parties. Alexinsky did
      not bother to redeem his honour before the Executive
      Committee. He preferred to hide himself in Plekhanov’s newspaper
      Yedinstvo, appearing first under initials, and then,
      after he had plucked up courage, under his full name.
    
 

On July 4, yesterday afternoon, a few Bolsheviks were warned by
      friends that Alexinsky had laid before the Petrograd journalists’
      committee some new malicious libel. Most of those who received the
      warning ignored it completely, treating Alexinsky and his
      “work” with disdainful contempt. But one Bolshevik,
      Jugashvili (Stalin), a member of the Central Executive Committee,
      who as a Georgian Social-Democrat had known Comrade Chkheidze for
      a long time, spoke to the latter at a meeting of the C.E.C. about
      Alexinsky’s new infamous slander campaign.
    

This happened late at night, but Chkheidze declared that the
      C.E.C. could not be indifferent to the spreading of libel by
      people who are afraid of open court and an investigation by the
      C.E.C. In his own name, as Chairman of the C.E.C., and in the
      name of Tsereteli, a member of the Provisional Government,
      Chkheidze immediately telephoned all newspaper
      offices, suggesting that they retrain from publishing
      Alexinsky’s libel. Chkheidze told Stalin that most papers
      had expressed readiness to comply with his request, and that
      only Yedinstvo and Rech had “kept
      silent” for a time (we have not seen Yedinstvo,
      but Rech has not printed the libel). As a
      result, the libel appeared only on the pages of a petty, yellow,
      and to most intelligent people completely unknown paper,
      Zhivoye
Slovo[3]
      No. 51 (404), whose editor
      and publisher signs himself A. M. Umansky.
    

The slanderers will now answer before the court. In this respect
      things are quite simple.
    

The absurdity of the libel is striking: a certain ensign of the
      Sixteenth Siberian Rifle Regiment by the name of Yermolenko was
      “dispatched” (?) “on April 25 to us behind the
      front lines of the Sixth Army to agitate for the speediest
      conclusion of a separate peace treaty with
      Germany”. Apparently, he is the escaped prisoner of whom
      the
      “document” published in Zhivoye Slovo says:
      “This commission was accepted by. Yermolenko on the
      insistence of the comrades”!!
    

From this alone you can judge how little faith can be
      put
      in an individual who is dishonourable enough to accept such
      a “commission”!... The witness has no sense of
      honour. This is
      a fact.
    

And what was the witness’s testimony?
    
 

He testified the following: “Officers of the German
      General Staff, Schiditzki and Lübers, had told him that
      propaganda of a similar kind was being carried on in Russia by
      A. Skoropis-Yoltukhovsky, chairman of the Ukrainian section of
      the Union for the Liberation of the
      Ukraine,[4]
      and an
      agent of the German General Staff, and by Lenin. Lenin was
      commissioned to do all he could to undermine the confidence of
      the Russian people in the Provisional Government.”
    

Thus the German officers, in order to induce Yermolenko to
      commit this dishonourable act, shamelessly lied to him about
      Lenin who, as everybody knows and as is officially stated by the
      entire Bolshevik Party, has always rejected
      most emphatically, consistently, and unconditionally a separate
      peace treaty with Germany!! The lie of the German officers is so
      obvious, crude and preposterous that no literate person would
      even for a moment take it for anything but a lie. And a
      politically literate person would be even more certain that to
      associate Lenin with an individual like Yoltukhovsky (?) and
      with the Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine is particularly
      preposterous, for both Lenin and all other internationalists
      have repeatedly dissociated themselves publicly from
      this dubious social-patriotic “Union” during the
      war!
    

The crude lie told by Yermolenko, whom the Germans had bribed,
      or by German officers, would not deserve the slightest
      attention, were it not that the “document” has added
      what it calls “fresh information”—it is not known by
      whom, from whom, how, or when received—according to which
      “money for propaganda is being received” (by whom?
      the “document” is afraid to say plainly
      that the accused or suspected is Lenin!! The document says
      nothing about who “is receiving it”)
      “through trusted people”: the
      “Bolsheviks” Fürstenberg (Hanecki) and
      Kozlovsky. It is alleged that there is information proving the
      transfer of money through banks, and that “the military
      censorship has discovered a continuous (!) exchange of telegrams
      of a political and financial nature between German agents and
      Bolshevik leaders”!!
    

Again such a crude lie that it sticks out like a sore thumb. If
      there were even a word of truth in that, then how could it
      happen (1) that Hanecki had quite recently been allowed
      freely to enter Russia and permitted to leave her just as

    

      freely?
      (2) that neither Hanecki nor Kozlovsky had
      been arrested before the appearance in the press of
      information concerning their crimes? Is it really possible
      that the General Staff, had it actually been in possession
      of even remotely trustworthy information about the sending
      of money, telegrams, etc., would have permitted the
      publication of rumours about this, through the Alexinskys
      and the yellow press, without arresting Hanecki and
      Kozlovsky? Isn’t it clear this is nothing but the cheap work
      of newspaper slanderers of the lowest order?
    

We may add that Hanecki and Kozlovsky are not Bolsheviks, but
      members of the Polish Social-Democratic Party; that we have
      known Hanecki, a member of its Central Committee, since the
      1903 London Congress from which the Polish delegates withdrew,
      and so on. The Bolsheviks never received any
      money from either Hanecki or Kozlovsky. All that is a lie,
      a complete, vulgar lie.
    

What is its political significance? First, it indicates that the
      Bolsheviks’ political opponents are so low and contemptible
      that they cannot get along without lies and libel.
    

Secondly, it provides us with an answer to the title question
      of this article.
    

The report about the “documents” was sent to
      Kerensky as early as May 16. Kerensky is a member of
      the Provisional Government and the Soviet, i.e., of both
      “powers”. May16 to July 5 is a long time. The power,
      if it really were a power, could and should itself have
      investigated those “documents”, interrogated the
      witnesses, and arrested the suspects. The power, both
      “powers”—the Provisional Government and the
      C.E.C.—could and should have done this.
    

Yet both powers are inactive, while the General Staff is found
      to have some sort of relations with Alexinsky, who was not
      admitted to the Soviet’s Executive Committee owing to his
      libellous activities! The General Staff, at the very moment of
      the Cadets’ withdrawal, permits—probably by
      accident—the handing over of its official documents to
      Alexinsky for publication!
    

The power is inactive. Neither Kerensky, nor the Provisional
      Government, nor the C.E.C. so much as think of arresting Lenin,
      Hanecki, or Kozlovsky, if they are under suspicion. Last night,
      July 4, both Chkheidze and Tsereteli

    

      asked the newspapers not to print the obvious libel. But just a
      little later, late at night, Polovtsev sent military cadets and
      Cossacks to wreck Pravda’s offices, stop the paper’s
      publication, arrest its publishers, seize its ledgers (on the
      pretext of investigating whether or not suspicious funds were
      involved). At the same time that yellow, base, filthy little
      rag, Zhivoye Slovo, printed foul libel to arouse
      passions, revile the Bolsheviks, create an atmosphere of mob
      violence, and afford a plausible justification for the behaviour
      of Polovtsev, the military cadets and the Cossacks who had
      wrecked Pravda’s offices.
    

Whoever does not close his eyes to the truth cannot
      remain deluded. When it is necessary to act,
      both powers remain inactive—the C.E.C., because
      it “trusts” the Cadets and is afraid of irritating
      them, and the Cadets, who do not act as a power because they
      prefer to act behind the scenes.
    

Counter-revolution behind the scenes—this is it, as clear
      as day: the Cadets, certain quarters of the General Staff
      ("high-ranking officers”, as our Party’s resolution
      calls them), and the shady, semi-Black Hundred press. These are
      not inactive, these “work” together hand in
      glove; this is the soil in which pogroms, attempted pogroms, the
      shooting of demonstrators, etc., etc., are nurtured.
    

Whoever does not deliberately shut his eyes to the truth cannot
      remain deluded any longer.
    

There is no power, and there will be none until the transfer of
      power to the Soviets lays the foundation for creating
      power. Counter-revolution thrives on the absence of authority
      by uniting the Cadets with certain high-ranking officers and
      with the Black Hundred press. This is a sad reality, but a
      reality nevertheless.
    

Workers and soldiers! You must show firmness, determination and
      vigilance!
    

 
Notes
 
 



[1]
Lenin is referring to the massive demonstrations that took place
in Petrograd on July 3 and 4 (16 and 17), 1917. The soldiers, sailors
and workers took to the streets, being angered by the Provisional
Government sending troops into an offensive that ended in defeat,
as might have been expected. The movement began on July 3 (16)
in the Vyborg district with the action of the First Machine-Gun
Regiment. It threatened to develop into an insurrection against
the Provisional Government.

Just then the Bolshevik Party was against all armed action,
for it considered that there was no revolutionary crisis in the
country as yet. The Central Committee meeting held at 4 p.m., on
July 3 (16), resolved to refrain from action. A similar resolution was
adopted by the Bolsheviks’ Second Petrograd City Conference,
which took place at the same time. Conference delegates went to
the city’s factories and districts to restrain the masses from action.
But action had already begun and there was no stopping it.

In view of the mood of the masses, the Central Committee,
meeting in a joint session with the Petrograd Committee and the
Military Organisation, resolved late on the evening of July 3 (16)
to join in the demonstration in order to lend it a peaceful and
organised character. Lenin was not in Petrograd at the time—being
ill as a result of sustained overwork, he had gone to the country
for a few day’s rest. Getting word of the events, he returned to
Petrograd on the morning of July 4 (17) and assumed political
leadership. During the day of July 4 (17) he addressed the
Kronstadt sailors from the balcony of Kshesinskaya’s Palace (see this
volume, p. 213). His speech played an important part; it called
on the sailors to exercise restraint and be staunch and vigilant.

Over 500,000 people took part in the July 4 (17) demonstration.
They carried Bolshevik slogans—“All Power to the Soviets!”, etc.
They insisted that the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets
take power into its hands. But the S.R. and Menshevik leaders
refused to take power.

With the knowledge and consent of (lie Menshevik and S.R.
Central Executive Committee, the Provisional Government sent
military cadets and Cossacks against the peaceful demonstration.
The troops opened fire. In addition to them the Provisional
Government called in counter-revolutionary units from the front line
to smash the demonstration.

A meeting of the Central and Petrograd Committees held on
the night of July 4–5 under Lenin’s leadership resolved to
discontinue the demonstration in an organised fashion. It was a judicious

   

measure by the Party, which knew how to retreat in time and stave
off the defeat of the main revolutionary forces. The Mensheviks
and S.R.s virtually took part in and abetted the counter–
revolutionary butchery. They joined the bourgeoisie in bearing down
on the Bolshevik Party. Pravda, Soldatskaya Pravda and other
Bolshevik papers were closed down by the Provisional
Government, and the printing plant of Trud, acquired with money collected
by the workers, was wrecked. The workers were disarmed, and
arrests, house searches and riots took place. The
revolutionary-minded units in the Petrograd garrison were sent off to the front
line.

After the July events power in the country was fully taken over
by the counter-revolutionary Provisional Government. The Soviets
became a mere appendage to it. Dual power was at an end. So was
the peaceful period of the revolution. The Bolsheviks were faced
with the task of preparing for an armed uprising to overthrow the
Provisional Government.





[2]
Lenin is referring to the following fact: Upon his return from
abroad in April 1917 G. A. Alexinsky, a slanderer and plotter,
began to contribute to the bourgeois Russkaya Volya (all socialist
newspapers having refused to have anything to do with him) and
proffered his services to the Executive Committee of the Petrograd
Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. The Executive
Committee adopted the following decision: “In view of the facts regarding
G. A. Alexinsky’s activity that have become known, the Executive
Committee does not see its way to admitting him into its
institutions. Should lie wish to rehabilitate! himself, the Executive
Committee will not be disagreeable to taking part in an investigation.”





[3]
Zhivoye Slovo (The Living Word)—a yellow daily newspaper with
Black Hundred leanings published in Petrograd from 1916. In 1917
it campaigned rabidly against the Bolsheviks. The October
Revolution put an end to its publication.





[4]
The Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine was founded by a group
of Ukrainian bourgeois nationalists in 1914, shortly after the
beginning of the First World War. Expecting tsarist Russia to lose the
war, the Union sought the Ukraine’s secession from Russia and
the establishment of a bourgeois and landowner Ukrainian
monarchy under German protectorate.

The more violent the slander and lies against the Bolsheviks
    these days, the more calmly must we, while refuting the lies and
    slander, reflect upon the historical interrelation of events and
    the political, i.e., class, significance of the revolution’s
    present course. 

To refute the lies and slander, we only have to refer again to
    Listok “Pravdy” of July 6, and to call the reader’s
    attention especially to the article printed below which gives
    documentary evidence that on July 2 the Bolsheviks campaigned
    against the demonstration (as admitted by the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries’ paper). The article indicates that on
    July 3 the popular mood exploded into action and the demonstration
    started against our advice. It shows that on July 4, in a leaflet
    (reprinted by the Socialist-Revolutionary paper Dyelo
    Naroda), we called for a peaceful and
    organised demonstration, that on the night of July 4 we
    passed a decision to call off the demonstration. Slanderers,
    continue your slander! You can never refute these facts and their
    decisive significance in every connection! 

Let us turn to the question of the historical interrelation of
    the events. When, as early as the beginning of April, we opposed
    support for the Provisional Government, we were attacked by both
    the S.R.s and the Mensheviks. But what has reality proved? 

What have the three political crises proved — April 20 and
    21, June 10 and 18, July 3 and 4?

They have proved, in the first place, that the masses are
    becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the bourgeois policy of
    the Provisional Government’s bourgeois majority. 
 

It is rather interesting to note that the ruling
    Socialist-Revolutionaries’ newspaper, Dyelo Naroda,
    despite its marked hostility to the Bolsheviks, is compelled to
    admit, in its July 6 issue, the deep economic and political causes
    of the action of July 3 and 4. The stupid, crude, infamous lie
    that this action was artificially created, that the Bolsheviks
    campaigned in favour of action, will daily be more and
    more exposed. 

The common cause, the common origin, the deep common root of
    the three above-mentioned political crises is clear, especially if
    we look at them in their interrelation, as science demands that
    politics be looked at. It is absurd even to think that three such
    crises could be produced artificially. 

In the second place, it is instructive to grasp what each one
    of them had in common with the others, and what was its specific
    features. 

What is common to all three is a mass dissatisfaction
    overflowing all bounds, a mass resentment with the bourgeoisie and
    their government. Whoever forgets, ignores or
    underestimates this essence of the matter, renounces the
    ABC of socialism concerning the class struggle. 

Let those who call themselves socialists, who know something
    about the character of the class struggle in European revolutions,
    think about the class struggle in the Russian revolution. 

These crises are peculiar in the ways they manifested
    themselves. The first (April 20–21) was stormy and spontaneous,
    and completely unorganised. It led to Black Hundreds firing on the
    demonstrators and to unprecedentedly savage and lying accusations
    against the Bolsheviks. After the outburst came a political
    crisis. 

In the second case, the demonstration was called by the
    Bolsheviks, and was canceled after a stern ultimatum and direct
    ban by the Congress of Soviets; then, on June 18, came a general
    demonstration in which the Bolshevik slogans clearly
    predominated. As the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks
    themselves admitted on the evening of June 18, a political crisis
    would certainly have broken out had it not been for the offensive
    at the front. 

The third crisis broke out spontaneously on July 3 despite the
    Bolsheviks’ efforts on July 2 to check it. Reaching its

    

climax on
    July 4, it led to a furious outburst of counter-revolution on July 5 and 6. The vacillation of the S.R.s and Mensheviks expressed
    itself in Spiridonova and a number of other S.R.s declaring for
    the transfer of power to the Soviets, and in the Menshevik
    internationalists, previously opposed to it, voicing the same
    idea. 

The last, and perhaps the most instructive, conclusion to be
    drawn from considering the events in their interconnection is that
    all three crises manifested some form of demonstration that is new
    in the history of our revolution, a demonstration of a more
    complicated type in which the movement proceeds in waves, a sudden
    drop following a rapid rise, revolution and counter-revolution
    becoming more acute, and the middle elements being eliminated for
    a more or less extensive period. 

In all three crises, the movement took the form of a
    demonstration. An anti-government demonstration —
    that would be the most exact, formal description of events. But
    the fact of the matter is that it was not an ordinary
    demonstration; it was something considerably more than a
    demonstration, but less than a revolution. It was an outburst of
    revolution and counter-revolution together, a sharp,
    sometimes almost sudden elimination of the middle elements, while
    the proletarian and bourgeois elements made a stormy
    appearance. 

In this respect it is extremely typical that, for each
    of these movements, the middle elements blame both of the
    specific class forces — the proletariat as well as the
    bourgeoisie. Look at the S.R.s and Mensheviks. They lean over
    backwards to frantically shout that, by their extremes, the
    Bolsheviks are helping the counter-revolution. At the same time,
    however, they admit again and again that the Cadets (with whom
    they form a bloc in the government) are
    counter-revolutionary. "Our urgent task is to draw a line," wrote
    Dyelo Naroda yesterday, "to dig a deep moat between
    ourselves and all the Right elements, including
    Yedinstvo, which has gone militant" (with which, we may
    add, the S.R.s formed a bloc during the elections). 

Compare that with today’s (July 7) issue of Yedinstvo,
    in which Plekhanov’s editorial is compelled to state the
    indisputable fact that the Soviets (i.e., the S.R.s and

    

    Mensheviks) will "think over the matter for a fortnight" and that,
    if power were to pass to the Soviets, "it would be tantamount to
    victory for Lenin’s supporters". "If the Cadets don’t stick to the
    rule—the worse, the better...," says Plekhanov, "they
    themselves will have to admit that they have made a big mistake
    [by withdrawing from the Cabinet], making the work of Lenin’s
    supporters easier.” 

Isn’t that typical? The middle elements blame the Cadets for
    making the Bolsheviks’ work easier, and the Bolsheviks for making
    the Cadets’ work easier! Is it so hard to guess that if we
    substitute class names for political ones we have before us the
    dreams of the petty bourgeoisie about the disappearance of the
    class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie? Isn’t
    the petty bourgeoisie complaining about the class struggle between
    the proletariat and the bourgeoisie? Is it really so hard to guess
    that no Bolsheviks in the world could have “created” even a single
    "popular movement", let alone three movements, if the deepest
    economic and political causes had not set the proletariat into
    action? Is it so difficult to guess that no Cadets and monarchists
    combined could have called forth any movement "from the Right" if
    it had not been for the equally deep causes that make the
    bourgeoisie as a class counter-revolutionary? 

Both we and the Cadets were blamed for the April 20-21 movement
    — for intransigence, extremes, and for aggravating the
    situation. The Bolsheviks were even accused (absurd as it may be)
    of the firing on Nevsky. When the movement was over, however,
    those same S.R.s and Mensheviks, in their joint, official organ,
    Izvestia, wrote that the "popular movement" had "swept
    away the imperialists, Milyukov, etc.", i.e., they
    praised the movement!! Isn’t that typical? Doesn’t it
    show very clearly that the petty bourgeoisie do not understand the
    workings, the meaning, of the class struggle between the
    proletariat and the bourgeoisie? 

The objective situation is this. The vast majority of the
    country’s population is petty-bourgeois by its living conditions
    and more so by its ideas. But big capital rules the country,
    primarily through banks and syndicates. There is an urban
    proletariat in this country, mature enough to go its own way, but
    not yet able to draw at once the majority of the semi-proletarians
    to its side. From this fundamental,

    

class fact follows the
    inevitability of such crises as the three we are now examining, as
    well as their forms. 

In future the forms of crises may, of course, change, but the
    substance of the issue will remain the same even if, for instance,
    the S.R. Constituent Assembly meets in October. The S.R.s have
    promised the peasants:
(1) to abolish private landownership;
(2)
    to transfer the land to the working people;
(3) to confiscate the
    landed estates and transfer them to the peasants without
    compensation. These great reforms can never be realised without
    the most decisive revolutionary measures against the bourgeoisie,
    measures that can only be taken when the poor peasants
    join the proletariat, only when the banks and the
    syndicates are nationalised. 

The credulous peasants, believing for a time that these
    beautiful things can be achieved by compromising with the
    bourgeoisie, will inevitably be disappointed and
    . . . “dissatisfied” (mildly speaking) with the sharp class
    struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie for the
    implementation of the promises of the S.R.s. So it was, and so it
    will be.

[1]
The offices of Pravda having been wrecked on July 5 (18), 1917,
by the Provisional Government, the article “Three Crises” appeared
in Rabotnitsa No. 7 on July 19 (August 1). The editors of the
journal wanted that particular issue to be circulated as widely as
possible and therefore published on the cover an appeal to all workers,
trade unions, factory committees, and R.S.D.L.P.(B.) cells and
district organisations earnestly asking them to take energetic steps
for the widest possible dissemination of the issue.

Rabotnitsa (Woman Worker)—a legal periodical published by the
C.C. R.S.D.L.P.(B.) on Lenin’s initiative in St. Petersburg, with
money collected by women workers. It appeared from February 23
(March 8) to June 1914. Seven issues were brought out, of which
the police confiscated three. Among the members of its editorial
board were I. F. Armand, A. I. Yelizarova, N. K. Krupskaya,
P. F. Kudelli, L. R. Menzhinskaya, Y. F. Rozmirovich, K. N.
Samoilova and L. N. Stal.

The periodical resumed publication on May 10 (23), 1917,
and continued till January 1918.

Rabotnitsa played an important part in the political education
of women workers during the Bolshevik Party s preparations for
the socialist revolution in Russia.

Judging by private conversations, there are two opinions on this
      question.
    

Comrades succumbing to the “Soviet atmosphere” often
      incline towards appearing in court.
    

Those closer to the workers apparently incline towards not
      appearing.
    

In principle, the question chiefly boils down to an estimation
      of what is usually called constitutional illusions.
    

Anyone who thinks that a regular government and a regular court
      exist or can exist in Russia, that a Constituent Assembly is
      likely to be called, may arrive at a conclusion in favour of
      appearing.
    

That idea is completely erroneous, however. It is the latest
      events, after July 4, that have most vividly shown that a
      Constituent Assembly is unlikely to be called (with out a new
      revolution), that neither a regular government nor a regular
      court exists or can exist in Russia (at present).
    

The court is an organ of power. The liberals sometimes forget
      this, but it is a sin for a Marxist to do so.
    

Where, then, is the power? Who constitutes the power?
    

There is no government. it changes daily. It is inactive.
    

The power that is active is the military
      dictatorship. Under these conditions, it is ridiculous even to
      speak of “the courts”. It is not a question of
      “courts”, but of an episode in the civil
      war. This is what those in favour of appearing in court
      unfortunately do not want to understand.
    

Pereverzev and Alexinsky as initiators of the “case"!!
      Isn’t it ridiculous to speak of courts in such circumstances?

    

      Isn’t it naive to think that, in such conditions, any court can
      examine, investigate and establish anything??
    

Power is in the hands of a military dictatorship. Without a new
      revolution, this power can only become stronger for a certain
      time, primarily for the duration of the war.
    

      “I’ve done nothing against the law. The courts are
      just. They will sort things out. The trial will be public. The
      people will understand. I shall appear.”
    

This reasoning is childishly naïve. The authorities
      need not a trial but a persecution campaign against the
      internationalists. What Kerensky and Co. need is to put them in
      gaol and keep them there. So it was (in Britain and France), and
      so it will be (in Russia).
    

Let the internationalists work illegally as much as they can,
      but let them not commit the folly of appearing in court of their
      own free will!

Reference is to the summons for Lenin to appear before the court
of the bourgeois Provisional Government to answer the slanderous
charge of espionage in favour of Germany.

The Bolsheviks, who were fighting to transform the imperialist
war into a civil war and advocating the tsarist government s defeat
in the war, were first charged with high treason in favour of
Germany by the tsar’s secret police in the early days of the war.

After the February bourgeois-democratic revolution of 1917,
when the Party set course for a socialist revolution in Russia, the
bourgeois, Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik press carried
slanderous reports in view of the passage through Germany of
a Bolshevik group led by Lenin. The Seventh (April) Conference
exposed that lie in its resolution “On the War”.

The counter-revolution has become organised and consolidated,
      and has actually taken state power into its hands.
    

The complete organisation and consolidation of the
      counter-revolution consists in a combination of its three main
      forces, a combination excellently conceived and already put into
      practice:
      1. The Constitutional-Democratic Party, i. e., the real leader
         of the organised bourgeoisie, has, by withdrawing from the
         Cabinet, confronted it with an ultimatum, thus clearing the
         way for the Cabinet’s overthrow by the counter-revolution;
      2. The General Staff and the military leaders, with the
         deliberate or semi-deliberate assistance of Kerensky, whom
         even the most prominent Socialist-Revolutionaries now call a
         Cavaignac, have seized actual state power and have proceeded
         to shoot down revolutionary units at the front, disarm the
         revolutionary troops and workers in Petrograd and Moscow,
         suppress unrest in Nizhni-Novgorod, arrest Bolsheviks and ban
         their papers, not only without trial, but even without a
         government order. At present, basic state power in Russia is
         virtually a military dictatorship. This fact is still
         obscured by a number of institutions that are revolutionary
         in words but powerless in deeds. Yet it is so obvious and
         fundamental a fact that without under standing it, one cannot
         understand anything about the political situation.
      3. The Black Hundred-monarchist and bourgeois press, which has
         switched from hounding Bolsheviks to hounding the Soviets,
         the “incendiary” Chernov, etc., has indicated
         with the utmost clarity that the true meaning of the policy
         of military dictatorship, which now reigns supreme and is
      supported by the Cadets

    

and monarchists, is preparations for
      disbanding the Soviets. Many of the leaders of the S.R.s and
      Mensheviks, i. e., the present majority in the Soviets, have
      admitted and expressed this during the past few days, but, true
      to their petty-bourgeois nature, they shrug off this formidable
      reality with meaningless high-sounding phrases.
    

      2. The leaders of the Soviets and of the Socialist-Revolutionary
      and Menshevik parties, headed by Tsereteli and Chernov, have
      completely betrayed the cause of the revolution by putting it
      in the hands of the counter-revolutionaries and by turning
      themselves, their parties and the Soviets into mere fig-leaves
      of the counter-revolution.
    

Proof of this is that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
      Mensheviks have betrayed the Bolsheviks and have tacitly agreed
      to close down their papers without daring to tell the people
      plainly and openly that they are doing so and why. By
      sanctioning the disarming of the workers and the revolutionary
      regiments, they have deprived themselves of all real power. They
      have turned into the most loud-mouthed ranters who help the
      reaction to “divert” the people’s attention until it
      is finally ready to disband the Soviets. It is impossible to
      understand anything at all about the present political situation
      without realising this complete and final bankruptcy of the
      S.R.s and Mensheviks and the present majority in the Soviets and
      without realising that their “Directory” and other
      masquerades are an absolute sham.
    

      3. All hopes for a peaceful development of the Russian revolution
      have vanished for good. This is the objective situation: either
      complete victory for the military dictatorship, or victory for
      the workers’ armed uprising; the latter victory is only possible
      when the insurrection coincides with a deep, mass upheaval
      against the government and the bourgeoisie caused by economic
      disruption and the prolongation of the war.
    

The slogan “All Power to the Soviets!” was a slogan for
      peaceful development of the revolution which was possible in
      April, May, June, and up to July 5-9, i. e., up to the time when
      actual power passed into the hands of the military
      dictatorship. This slogan is no longer correct,
      for it does not take into account that power has changed

    

hands
      and that the revolution has in fact been completely betrayed by
      the S.R.s and Mensheviks. Reckless actions, revolts, partial
      resistance, or hopeless hit-and-run attempts to oppose reaction
      will not help. What will help is a clear understanding of t.he
      situation, endurance and determination of the workers’ vanguard,
      preparation of forces for the armed uprising, for the victory of
      which conditions at present are extremely difficult, but still
      possible if the facts and trends mentioned above coincide. Let
      us have no constitutional or republican illusions of any kind,
      no more illusions about a peaceful path, no sporadic actions, no
      yielding now to provocation from the Black Hundreds and
      Cossacks. Let us gather forces, reorganise them, and resolutely
      prepare for the armed uprising, if the course of the crisis
      permits it on a really mass, country-wide scale. The transfer of
      land to the peasants is impossible at present without armed
      uprising, since the counter-revolutionaries, having taken power,
      have completely united with the landowners as a class.
    

The aim of the insurrection can only be to transfer power to the
      proletariat, supported by the poor peasants, with a view to
      putting our Party programme into effect.
    

      4. The party of the working class, without abandoning legal
      activity, but never for a moment overrating it, must
      combine legal with illegal work, as it did in 1912-14.
    

Don’t let slip a single hour of legal work. But don’t cherish
      any constitutional or “peaceful” illusions. Form
      illegal organisations or cells everywhere and at once for the
      publication of leaflets, etc. Reorganise immediately,
      consistently, resolutely, all along the line.
    

Act as we did in 1912–14, when we could speak about overthrowing
      tsarism by a revolution and an armed uprising, without at the
      same time losing our legal base in the Duma, the insurance
      societies, the trade unions, etc.

The article “The Political Situation” was first published in the
Kronstadt Bolshevik paper Proletarskoye Dyelo No. 6 on August 2
(July 20), 1917, under the heading “Political Mood”.

To safeguard the newspaper against suppression by the
Provisional Government, the editors substituted “a resolute fight” for
“an armed uprising”. In this volume, the article appears according
to the manuscript.

Permit us, comrades, to turn to your hospitality on account of
      the forced suspension of our Party paper. Certain papers have
      begun a furious baiting campaign against us, accusing us of
      espionage or of communicating with an enemy government.
    

The extraordinary thoughtlessness (an inappropriate and much too
      weak a word) with which this baiting is con ducted may be seen
      from the following plain facts. Zhivoye Slovo first
      published a statement that Lenin was a spy. Then, in a
      “correction” which is supposed not to change any
      thing, it declared that he was not accused of spying! First the
      paper came out with Yermolenko’s testimony, then it was
      compelled to admit that it is downright awkward and shameful to
      see such a person’s testimony as evidence.
    

The name of Parvus is dragged in, without mentioning, however,
      that no one denounced Parvus as sharply and mercilessly, as far
      back as 1915, as the Geneva Sotsial-Demokrat, which we
      edited and which, in an article entitled “The Uttermost,
      Limit”, branded Parvus as “a renegade’.’
      “licking Hindenburg’s
      boots”,[1]

      etc. Every literate
      person knows, or can easily find out, that all political or
      other relations between ourselves and Parvus are completely out
      of the question.
    

The name of one Sumenson is trotted out, a woman with whom we
      have never even met, let alone had anything to do. Business
      enterprises of Hanecki and Kozlovsky are also dragged in, but
      not a single fact is mentioned as to where, how and when the
      business was a screen for espionage.

    

      Not only have we never participated directly or indirectly in
      business enterprises, but we have never received from any of the
      above comrades a single kopek either for our selves personally or
      for the Party.
    

They go so far as to blame us for Pravda dispatches
      being reprinted in a distorted fashion by German newspapers, but
      they “forget” to mention that Pravda issues
      German and French bulletins abroad and that the reprinting of
      material from these bulletins is entirely
      free.[2]


And all this is done with the participation and even on the
      initiative of Alexinsky, who has not been admitted to the
      Soviet, who, in other words, has been recognised as an obvious
      slanderer!! Is it really impossible to under stand that
      such methods against us are tantamount to legal
      assassination? The Central Executive Committee’s discussion
      of the conditions on which the Committee’s members could be
      brought to court undoubtedly introduces an element of
      orderliness.[3]
      Will the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
      parties want to participate in an attempt at legal
      assassination? Will they.want to take part in an attempt to put
      us on trial without even indicating whether we are accused of
      espionage or mutiny, in an attempt to put us on trial without
      any precise indictment at all? Will they want to take part in an
      attempt to stage’ an obviously unfair trial which may handicap
      their own candidates in the Constituent Assembly elections?
      Will those parties want to make the eve of the convocation of a
      Constituent Assembly in Russia the beginning of a Dreyfusiad on
      Russian soil?
    

The near future will give an answer to these questions which we
      deem it the duty of the free press to raise openly.
    

We are not talking about the bourgeois press. Of course,
      Milyukov believes in our espionage or in our acceptance of
      German money about as much as Markov and Zamyslovsky believed
      that Jews drink children’s blood.
    

But Milyukov and Co. know what they are doing.

Byulleten “Pravdy” (The “Pravda” Bulletin) was published in
German in Stockholm from June to November 1917 under the title
of Russische Korrespondenz “Prawda”. Its publisher was a C.C.
R.S.D.L.P.(B.) group abroad, and it carried articles on major
issues of the Russian revolution, documents, reviews, and news
items on the life of the Party and the country. There was also
a French edition.





[3]
After the reactionary Zhivoye Slovo had published the infamous
calumny against Lenin, the Menshevik and S.R. Central Executive
Committee of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on
July 5 (18), 1917, appointed a commission of inquiry at the instance
of the Bolshevik group to investigate the slanderous charges against
Lenin and other Bolsheviks. But as soon as the Provisional
Government had decided to refer the case “of the organised armed action
in the city of Petrograd on July 3–5, 1917, against state power”
to the Petrograd Court, the C.E.C. commission of inquiry resigned
and on July 9 (22) published in Izvestia the statement that it was
“discontinuing its activity and putting the evidence collected by
it at the disposal of a government committee”. At a joint meeting
held by the C.E.C. of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies
and the Executive Committee of the All-Russia Congress of
Peasants’ Deputies on July 13 (26), the Mensheviks and
Socialist-Revolutionaries put through a resolution stating that they
considered Lenin’s refusal to appear in court absolutely impermissible.
The resolution said that all persons against whom charges had been
preferred by the judicial authorities were removed from work in
the Soviets.

Comrades,


We have changed our minds about submitting to the Provisional
      Government’s decree ordering our arrests, for the following
      reasons.
    

From the letter of Pereverzev, the former Minister of Justice,
      published on Sunday in Novoye Vremya, it became
      perfectly clear that the “espionage”
      “case” of Lenin and others was quite deliberately
      framed by the party of the counter-revolution.
    

Pereverzev has openly admitted that he took advantage of
      unconfirmed accusations to work up (his actual expression) the
      soldiers against our Party. This is admitted by the former
      Minister of Justice, a man who only yesterday called himself a
      socialist! Pereverzev is gone, but whether the new Minister of
      Justice will hesitate to adopt Pereverzev’s and Alexinsky’s
      methods, nobody can venture to say.
    

The counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie are trying to create a new
      Dreyfus case. They believe in our “espionage” as
      much as the leaders of Russian reaction, who framed the Beilis
      case,[1]
      believed that Jews drink children’s
      blood. There are no guarantees of justice in Russia at present.
    

The Central Executive Committee, which considers it self the
      plenipotentiary organ of the Russian democrats, appointed a
      commission to investigate the espionage charges, but under
      pressure from the counter-revolutionary forces dismissed it. The
      Central Executive Committee refused to either directly confirm
      or to revoke the warrant for our arrest. It washed its hands of
      the case, virtually delivering us to the counter-revolution.
    
 

The charges of “conspiracy” and “moral
      incitement” to revolt preferred against us are of a very
      definite nature, but no precise indictment of our alleged crime
      is brought either by the Provisional Government or by the
      Soviet, both of which know full well that it is sheer nonsense
      to speak of “conspiracy” in referring to a movement
      like that of July 3–5. The Menshevik and S.R. leaders
      are simply trying to appease the counter-revolution
      that is already bearing down on them too, by delivering a number
      of our Party members to the counter-revolutionaries in
      compliance with their demand. At present there can be no legal
      basis in Russia, not even such constitutional guarantees as
      exist in the orderly bourgeois countries. To give ourselves up
      at present to the authorities would mean putting ourselves into
      the hands of the Milyukovs, Alexinskys, Pereverzevs, of rampant
      counter-revolutionaries who look upon all the charges against us
      as a simple civil war episode.
    

After what happened on July 6–8, not a single Russian
      revolutionary can harbour constitutional illusions any
      longer. Revolution and counter-revolution are coming to grips in
      a decisive fashion. We shall continue to fight on the side of
      the former.
    

We shall continue to aid the proletariat’s revolutionary
      struggle as far as we can. The Constituent Assembly alone, if it
      meets, and if its convocation is not the handiwork of the
      bourgeoisie, will have full authority to pass judgement upon
      the Provisional Government’s decree ordering our arrest.
    

N. Lenin

Beilis case—the trial of the Jew Beilis, staged for provocative
purposes by the tsar’s government in 1913 in Kiev. Beilis was falsely
accused of the ritual murder of Yushchinsky, a Christian boy (the
murder was actually committed by the Black Hundreds). The
government’s aim was to stir up anti-Semitism and take advantage
of anti-Jewish pogroms to divert the people’s attention from the
revolutionary movement growing throughout the country. The
trial aroused public indignation. In a number of towns, workers
held protest demonstrations. Beilis was acquitted.

Too often has it happened that, when history has taken a sharp
      turn, even progressive parties have for some time been unable to
      adapt themselves to the new situation and have repeated slogans
      which had formerly been correct hut had now lost all
      meaning—lost it as “suddenly” as the sharp
      turn in history was “sudden”.
    

Something of the sort seems likely to recur in connection with
      the slogan calling for the transfer of all state power to the
      Soviets. That slogan was correct during a period of our
      revolution—say, from February 27 to July 4—that has
      now passed irrevocably. It has patently ceased to be correct
      now. Unless this is understood, it is impossible to understand
      anything of the urgent questions of the day. Every particular
      slogan must be deduced from the totality of specific features of
      a definite political situation. And the political situation in
      Russia now, after July 4, differs radically from the situation
      between February 27 and July 4.
    

During that period of the revolution now past, the so-called
      “dual power” existed in the country, which both
      materially and formally expressed the indefinite and
      transitional
      condition of state power. Let us not forget that the issue of
      power is the fundamental issue of every revolution.
    

At that time state power was unstable. It was shared, by
      voluntary agreement, between the Provisional Government and the
      Soviets. The Soviets were delegations from the mass of
      free—i.e., not subject to external coercion—and
      armed workers and soldiers. What really mattered was
      that arms were in the hands of the people and that there was
      no coercion of the people from without. That is what opened

 

up
      and ensured a peaceful path for the progress of the
      revolution. The slogan “All Power Must Be Transferred to
      the
      Soviets” was a slogan for the next step, the immediately
      feasible step, on that peaceful path of development. It was a
      slogan for the peaceful development of the revolution, which was
      possible and, of course, most desirable between February 27 and
      July 4 but which is now absolutely impossible.
    

Apparently, not all the supporters of the slogan “All
      Power Must Be Transferred to the Soviets” have given
      adequate thought to the fact that it was a slogan for peaceful
      progress of the revolution—peaceful not only in the sense
      that nobody, no class, no force of any importance, would then
      (between February 27 and July 4) have been able to resist and
      prevent the transfer of power to the Soviets. That is not
      all. Peaceful development would then have been possible, even in
      the sense that the struggle of classes and parties
      within the Soviets could have assumed a most peaceful
      and painless form, provided full state power had passed to the
      Soviets in good time.
    

The latter aspect of the matter has similarly not yet received
      adequate attention. In their class composition, the Soviets were
      organs of the movement of the workers and peasants, a ready-made
      form of their dictatorship. Had they possessed full state power,
      the main shortcoming of the petty-bourgeois groups, their chief
      sin, that of trusting the capitalists, really would have been
      overcome, would have been criticised by the experience of their
      own measures. The change of classes and parties in power could
      have proceeded peacefully within the Soviets, provided the
      latter wielded exclusive and undivided power. The contact
      between all the Soviet parties and the people could have
      remained stable and unimpaired. One must not forget for a single
      moment that only such a close contact between the Soviet parties
      and the people, freely growing in extent and depth, could have
      helped peacefully to get rid of the illusion of petty-bourgeois
      compromise with the bourgeoisie. The transfer of power to the
      Soviets would not, and could not, in itself have changed the
      correlation of classes; it would in no way have changed the
      petty-bourgeois nature of the peasants. But it would have taken
      a big and timely step towards

 

separating the peasants from the
      bourgeoisie, towards
      bringing them closer to, and then uniting them with, the
      workers.
    

This is what might have happened had power passed to the Soviets
      at the proper time. That would have been the easiest and the
      most advantageous course for the people. This course would have
      been the least painful, and it was therefore necessary to fight
      for it most energetically. Now, however, this struggle, the
      struggle for the timely transfer of power to the Soviets, has
      ended. A peaceful course of development has be come
      impossible. A non-peaceful and most painful course has begun.
    

The turning-point of July 4 was precisely a drastic change in
      the objective situation. The unstable condition of state power
      has come to an end. At the decisive point, power has passed into
      the hands of the counter-revolution. The development of the
      parties on the basis of the collaboration of the petty-bourgeois
      Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties and the
      counter-revolutionary Cadets has brought about a situation in
      which both these petty-bourgeois parties have virtually become
      participants in and abettors of counter revolutionary
      butchery. As the struggle between parties developed, the
      unreasoning trust which the petty bourgeoisie put in the
      capitalists led to their deliberate support of the
      counter-revolutionaries. The development of party relations has
      completed its cycle. On February 27, all classes found
      themselves united against the monarchy. After July 4, the
      counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, working hand in glove with
      the monarchists and the Black Hundreds, secured the support of
      the petty-bourgeois Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks,
      partly by intimidating them, and handed over real state power to
      the Cavaignacs, the military gang, who are shooting
      insubordinate soldiers at the front and smashing the Bolsheviks
      in Petrograd.
    

The slogan calling for the transfer of state power to the
      Soviets would now sound quixotic or mocking. Objectively it
      would be deceiving the people; it would be fostering in them the
      delusion that even now it is enough for the Soviets to
      want to take power, or to pass such a decision, for power to be
      theirs, that there are still parties in the Soviets which have
      not been tainted by abetting the butchers, that it is possible
      to undo what has been done.
    
 

It would be a profound error to think that the revolutionary
      proletariat is capable of “refusing” to support the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks against the
      counter-revolution by way of “revenge”, so to speak,
      for
      the support they gave in smashing the Bolsheviks, in shooting
      down soldiers at the front and in disarming the workers. First,
      this would be applying philistine conceptions of morality to the
      proletariat (since, for the good of the cause, the
      proletariat will always support not only the vacillating petty
      bourgeoisie but even the big bourgeoisie); secondly—and
      that is the important thing—it would be a philistine
      attempt to obscure the political substance of the situation by
      “moralising”.
    

And the political substance is that power can no longer be taken
      peacefully. It can be obtained only by winning a decisive
      struggle against those actually in power at the moment, namely,
      the military gang, the Cavaignacs, who are relying for support
      on the reactionary troops brought to Petrograd and on the Cadets
      and monarchists.
    

The substance of the situation is that these new holders of
      state power can be defeated only by the revolutionary masses,
      who, to be brought into motion, must not only be led by the
      proletariat, but must also turn their backs on the
      Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties, which have
      betrayed the cause of the revolution.
    

Those who introduce philistine morals into politics reason as
      follows: let us assume that the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
      Mensheviks did commit an “error” in supporting the
      Cavaignacs, who are disarming the proletariat and the
      revolutionary regiments; still, they must be given a chance to
      “rectify” their “error”; the
      rectification of the “error” “should not be
      made difficult” for them; the swing of the petty
      bourgeoisie towards the workers should be facilitated. Such
      reasoning would be childishly naive or simply stupid, if not a
      new
      deception of the workers. For the swing of the petty-bourgeois
      masses towards the workers would mean, and could only mean, that
      these masses had turned their backs upon the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. The
      Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties could now rectify
      their “error” only by denouncing Tsereteli, Chernov,
      Dan and Rakitnikov as the butchers’ aides. We are wholly

 

      and unconditionally in favour of their “error” being
      “rectified” in this way....
    

We said that the fundamental issue of revolution is the issue of
      power. We must add that it is revolutions that show us at every
      step how the question of where actual power lies is
      obscured, and reveal the divergence between formal and real
      power. .That is one of the chief characteristics of every
      revolutionary period. It was not clear in March and April 1917
      whether real power was in the hands of the government or the
      Soviet.
    

Now, however, it is particularly important for class-conscious
      workers to soberly face the fundamental issue of revolution,
      namely, who holds state power at the moment? Consider its
      material manifestations, do not mistake words for deeds, and you
      will have no difficulty in finding the answer.
    

Frederick Engels once wrote the state is primarily contingents
      of armed men with material adjuncts, such as
      prisons.[1]
      Now it is the military cadets and the
      reactionary Cossacks, who have been specially brought to
      Petrograd, those who are keeping Kamenev and the others in
      prison, who closed down Pravda, who disarmed the
      workers and a certain section of the soldiers, who are shooting
      down an equally certain section of the soldiers, who are
      shooting down an equally certain section of troops in the
      army. These butchers are the real power. The Tseretelis and
      Chernovs are ministers without power, puppet Ministers, leaders
      of parties that support the butchery. That is a fact. And the
      fact is no less true because Tsereteli and Chernov themselves
      probably “do not approve” of the butchery, or
      because their papers timidly dissociate themselves from it. Such
      changes of political garb change nothing in substance.
    

The newspaper of 150,000 Petrograd voters has been closed
      down. The military cadets on July 6 killed the worker Voinov for
      carrying Listok “Pravdy” out of the
      printers’. Isn’t that butchery? Isn’t that the handiwork of
      Cavaignacs? But neither the government nor the Soviets are to
      “blame” for this, they may tell us.
    

So much the worse for the government and the Soviets, we reply;
      for that means that they are mere figureheads, puppets, and that
      real power is not in their hands.
    
 

Primarily, and above all, the people must know the
      truth—they must know who actually wields state
      power. The people must be told the whole truth, namely, that
      power is in the hands of a military clique of Cavaignacs
      (Kerensky, certain generals, officers, etc.), who are supported
      by the bourgeois class headed by the Cadet Party, and by all the
      monarchists, acting through the Black Hundred papers, Novoye
      Vremya, Zhivoye Slovo, etc., etc.
    

That power must be overthrown. Unless this is done, all talk of
      fighting the counter-revolution is so much phrase-mongering,
      “self-deception and deception of the people”.
    

That power now has the support both of the Tseretelis and
      Chernovs in the Cabinet and of their parties. We must explain to
      the people the butcher’s role they are playing and the fact that
      such a “finale” for these parties was inevitable
      after their “errors” of April 21, May 5, June 9 and
      July 4 and after their approval of the policy of an offensive, a
      policy which went nine-tenths of the way to predetermining the
      victory of the Cavaignacs in July.
    

All agitational work among the people must be reorganised to
      ensure that it takes account of the specific experience of the
      present revolution, and particularly of the July days, i. e.,
      that it clearly points to the real enemy of the people, the
      military clique, the Cadets and the Black Hundreds, and that it
      definitely unmasks the petty-bourgeois parties, the
      Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties, which played and
      are playing the part of butcher’s aides.
    

All agitational work among the people must be reorganised so as
      to make clear that it is absolutely hopeless to expect the
      peasants to obtain land as long as the power of the military
      clique has not been overthrown, and as long as the
      Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties have not been
      exposed and deprived of the people’s trust. That would be a very
      long and arduous process under the “normal”
      conditions of capitalist development, but both the war and
      economic
      disruption will tremendously accelerate it. These are
      “accelerators” that may make a month or even a week
      equal to a year.
    

Two objections may perhaps be advanced against what has been
      said above: first, that to speak now of a decisive struggle is
      to encourage sporadic action, which would only benefit

 

      the counter-revolutionaries; second, that their overthrow would
      still mean transferring power to the Soviets.
    

In answer to the first objection, we say: the workers of Russia
      are already class-conscious enough not to yield to provocation
      at a moment which is obviously unfavourable to them. It is
      indisputable that for them to take action and offer resistance
      at the moment would mean aiding the counter-revolutionaries. It
      is also indisputable that a decisive struggle will be possible
      only in the event of a new revolutionary upsurge in the very
      depths of the masses. But it is not enough to speak in general
      terms of a revolutionary upsurge, of the rising tide of
      revolution, of aid by the West-European workers, and so forth;
      we must draw a definite conclusion from our past, from the
      lessons we have been given. And that will lead us to the slogan
      of a decisive struggle against the counter-revolutionaries, who
      have seized power.
    

The second objection also amounts to a substitution of
      arguments of too general a character for concrete realities. No
      one, no force, can overthrow the bourgeois counter
      revolutionaries except the revolutionary proletariat. Now, after
      the experience of July 1917, it is the revolutionary proletariat
      that must independently take over state power. Without that the
      victory of the revolution is impossible. The only
      solution is for power to be in the hands of the proletariat,
      and for the latter to be supported by the poor peasants or
      semi-proletarians. And we have already indicated the factors
      that can enormously accelerate this solution.
    

Soviets may appear in this new revolution, and indeed are bound
      to, but not the present Soviets, not organs
      collaborating with the bourgeoisie, but organs of revolutionary
      struggle against the bourgeoisie. It is true that even then we
      shall be in favour of building the whole state on the model of
      the Soviets. It is not a question of Soviets in general, but of
      combating the present counter-revolution and the
      treachery of the present Soviets.
    

The substitution of the abstract for the concrete is one of the
      greatest and most dangerous sins in a revolution. The present
      Soviets have failed, have suffered complete defeat, because they
      are dominated by the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
      parties. At the moment these Soviets are

 

      like sheep brought to the slaughterhouse and bleating pitifully
      under the knife. The Soviets at present are powerless and
      helpless against the triumphant and triumphing
      counter-revolution. The slogan calling for the transfer of power
      to
      the Soviets might be construed as a “simple” appeal
      for the transfer of power to the present Soviets, and to say that,
      to appeal for it, would now mean deceiving the people. Nothing is
      more dangerous than deceit.
    

The cycle of development of the class and party struggle in
      Russia from February 27 to July 4 is complete. A new cycle is
      beginning, one that involves not the old classes, not the old
      parties, not the old Soviets, but classes, parties and Soviets
      rejuvenated in the fire of struggle, tempered, schooled and
      refashioned by the process of the struggle. We must look
      forward, not backward. We must operate not with the old, but
      with the new, post-July, class and party categories. We must, at
      the beginning of the new cycle, proceed from the triumphant
      bourgeois counter-revolution,which triumphed because the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks compromised with it,
      and which can be defeated only by the revolutionary
      proletariat. Of course, in this new cycle there will be many
      and various stages, both before the complete victory of the
      counter-revolution and the complete defeat (without a struggle)
      of the Socialist- Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, and before a
      new upsurge of a new revolution. But it will only be possible to
      speak of this later, as each of these stages is reached.

Every revolution means a sharp turn in the lives of a vast
    number of people. Unless the time is ripe for such a turn, no real
    revolution can take place. And just as any turn in the life of an
      individual teaches him a great deal and brings rich experience and
      great emotional stress, so a revolution teaches an entire people
      very rich and valuable lessons in a short space of time.
    

During a revolution, millions and tens of millions of people
    learn in a week more than they do in a year of ordinary, somnolent
    life. For at the time of a sharp turn in the life of an entire
      people it becomes particularly clear what aims the various classes
      of the people are pursuing, what strength they possess, and what
      methods they use.
    

Every class-conscious worker, soldier and peasant should ponder
      thoroughly over the lessons of the Russian revolution, especially
      now, at the end of July, when it is clear that the first phase of
      our revolution has failed.
    
I

Let us see, in fact, what the workers and peasants were
      striving for when they made the revolution. What did they expect
      of the revolution? As we know, they expected liberty, peace, bread
      and land.
    

But what do we see now?
    

Instead of liberty, the old tyranny is coming back. The death
    penalty is being introduced for the soldiers at the
      front.[2]
Peasants are
    prosecuted for the unauthorised seizure of landed
    estates. Printing presses of workers’ newspapers are
      wrecked. Workers’ newspapers are closed down without
      trial. Bolsheviks are arrested, often without any charge or upon
      blatantly trumped-up charges.
    
 

It may be argued that the persecution of Bolsheviks does not
    constitute a violation of freedom, for only certain individuals
    are being prosecuted and on certain charges. Such an argument,
    however, would be a deliberate and obvious lie; for how can anyone
    wreck printing presses and close down newspapers for the crimes of
    individuals, even if these charges were proved and established by
    a court of law? It would be a different thing if the government
    had legally declared the whole party of the Bolsheviks, their very
      trend and views, to be criminal. But everybody knows that the
      government of free Russia could not, and did not, do anything of
      the kind.
    

What chiefly exposes the libelous character of the charges
    against the Bolsheviks is that the newspapers of the landowners
    and capitalists furiously abused the Bolsheviks for their struggle
    against the war and against the landowners and capitalists, and
      openly demanded the arrest and prosecution of the Bolsheviks even
      when not a single charge against a single Bolshevik had been
      trumped up.
    

The people want peace. Yet the revolutionary government of free
    Russia has resumed the war of conquest on the basis of those very
    same secret treaties which ex-Tsar Nicholas II concluded with the
    British and French capitalists so that the Russian capitalists
    might plunder other nations. Those secret treaties remain
      unpublished. The government of free Russia resorted to
      subterfuges, and to this day has not proposed a just peace to all
      nations.
    

There is no bread. Famine is again drawing near. Everybody sees
    that the capitalists and the rich are unscrupulously cheating the
    treasury on war deliveries (the war is now costing the nation
    fifty million rubles daily), that they are raking in fabulous
    profits through high prices, while nothing whatsoever has been
    done to establish effective control by the workers over the
    production and distribution of goods. The capitalists are becoming
      more brazen every day; they are throwing workers out into the
      street, and this at a time when the people are suffering from
      shortages.
    

A vast majority of the peasants, at congress after congress,
    have loudly and clearly declared that landed proprietorship is an
    injustice and robbery. Meanwhile, a

    

government which calls itself
    revolutionary and democratic has been leading peasants by the nose
    for months and deceiving them by promises and delays. For months
    the capitalists did not allow Minister Chernov to issue a law
    prohibiting the purchase and sale of land. And when this law was
    finally passed, the capitalists started a foul slander campaign
    against Chernov, which they are still continuing. The government
      has become so brazen in its defense of the landowners that it is
      beginning to bring peasants to trial for “unauthorised” seizures
      of land.
    

They are leading the peasants by the nose, telling them to wait
    for the Constituent Assembly. The convocation of the Assembly,
    however, is being steadily postponed by the capitalists. Now that
    owing to Bolshevik pressure it has been set for September 30, the
    capitalists are openly clamouring about this being “impossibly”
    short notice, and are demanding the Constituent Assembly’s
    postponement. The most influential members of the capitalist and
      landowner party, the “Cadet”, or "people’s freedom", Party, such
      as Panina, are openly urging that the convocation of the
      Constituent Assembly be delayed until after the war.
    

As to land, wait until the Constituent Assembly. As to the
    Constituent Assembly, wait until the end of the war. As to the end
      of the war, wait until complete victory. That is what it comes
      to. The capitalists and landowners, having a majority in the
      government, are plainly mocking at the peasants.
    
II

But how could this happen in a free country, after the
      overthrow of the tsarist regime?
    

In a non-free country, the people are ruled by a tsar and a
      handful of landowners, capitalists and bureaucrats who are not
      elected by anybody.
    

In a free country, the people are ruled only by those who have
    been elected for that purpose by the people themselves. At the
    elections the people divide themselves into parties, and as a rule
    each class of the population forms its own party; for instance,
    the landowners, the capitalists, the peasants and the workers all
      form separate parties. In free countries, therefore, the people
      are ruled through an

    

open struggle between parties and by free
      agreement between these parties.
    

For about four months after the overthrow of the tsarist regime
    on February 27, 1917, Russia was ruled as a free country, i.e.,
    through an open struggle between freely formed parties and by free
    agreement between them. To understand the development of the
      Russian revolution, therefore, it is above all necessary to study
      the chief parties, the class interests they defended, and the
      relations among them all.
    
III

After the overthrow of the tsarist regime state power passed
      into the hands of the first Provisional Government, consisting
      of representatives of the bourgeoisie, i.e., the capitalists,
      who were joined by the landowners. The “Cadet” Party, the chief
      capitalist party, held pride of place as the ruling and
      government party of the bourgeoisie.
    

It was no accident this party secured power, although it was not
      the capitalists, of course, but the workers and peasants, the
      soldiers and sailors, who fought the tsarist troops and shed
      their blood for liberty. Power was secured by the capitalist
      party because the capitalist class possessed the power of
      wealth, organisation and knowledge. Since 1905, and particularly
      during the war, the class of the capitalists, and the landowners
      associated with them, have made in Russia the greatest progress
      in organising.
    

The Cadet Party has always been monarchist, both in 1905 and
      from 1905 to 1917. After the people’s victory over tsarist
      tyranny it proclaimed itself a republican party. The experience
      of history shows that whenever the people triumphed over a
      monarchy, capitalist parties were willing to become republican
      as long as they could uphold the privileges of the capitalists
      and their unlimited power over the people.
    

The Cadet Party pays lip-service to "people’s freedom". But
      actually it stands for the capitalists, and it was immediately
      backed by all the landowners, monarchists and Black
      Hundreds. The press and the elections are proof of this. After
      the revolution, all the bourgeois papers and the whole Black
      Hundred press began to sing in unison with the

    

Cadets. Not
      daring to come out openly, all the monarchist parties supported
      the Cadet Party at the elections, as, for example, in
      Petrograd.
    

Having obtained state power, the Cadets made every effort to
      continue the predatory war of conquest begun by Tsar Nicholas
      II, who had concluded secret predatory treaties with the British
      and French capitalists. Under these treaties, the Russian
      capitalists were promised, in the event of victory, the seizure
      of Constantinople, Galicia, Armenia, etc. As to the people, the
      government of the Cadets put them off with empty subterfuges and
      promises, deferring the decision of all matters of vital and
      essential importance to the workers and peasants until the
      Constituent Assembly met, without appointing the date of its
      convocation.
    

Making use of liberty, the people began to organise
      independently. The chief organisation of the workers and
      peasants, who form the overwhelming majority of the population
      of Russia, was the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’
      Deputies. These Soviets already began to be formed during the
      February Revolution, and within a few weeks all class-conscious
      and advanced workers and peasants were united in Soviets in most
      of the larger cities of Russia and in many rural districts.
    

The Soviets were elected in an absolutely free way. They were
      genuine organisations of the people, of the workers and
      peasants. They were genuine organisations of the vast majority
      of the people. The workers and peasants in soldiers’ uniforms
      were armed.
    

It goes without saying that the Soviets could and should have
      taken over state power in full. Pending the convocation of the
      Constituent Assembly there should have been no other power in
      the state but the Soviets. Only then would our revolution have
      become a truly popular and truly democratic revolution. Only
      then could the working people, who are really striving for
      peace, and who really have no interest in a war of conquest,
      have begun firmly and resolutely to carry out a policy which
      would have ended the war of conquest and led to peace. Only then
      could the workers and peasants have curbed the capitalists, who
      are making fabulous profits “from the war" and who have reduced
      the

    

country to a state of ruin and starvation. But in the
      Soviets only a minority of the deputies were on the side of the
      revolutionary workers’ party, the Bolshevik Social Democrats,
      who demanded that all state power should be transferred to the
      Soviets. The majority of the deputies to the Soviets were on the
      side of the parties of the Menshevik Social-Democrats and the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, who were opposed to the transfer of
      power to the Soviets. Instead of removing the bourgeois
      government and replacing it by a government of the Soviets,
      these parties insisted on supporting the bourgeois government,
      compromising with it and forming a coalition government with
      it. This policy of compromise with the bourgeoisie pursued by
      the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties, who enjoyed
      the confidence of the majority of the people, is the main
      content of the entire course of development of the revolution
      during the five months since it began.
    
IV

Let us first see how this compromising of the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks with the bourgeoisie
      proceeded, and then let us try to explain why the majority of
      the people trusted them.
    
V

The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries have compromised
      with the capitalists in one way or another at every stage of the
      Russian revolution.
    

At the very close of February 1917, as soon as the people had
      triumphed and the tsarist regime had been overthrown, the
      capitalist Provisional Government admitted Kerensky as a
      “socialist”. As a matter of fact, Kerensky has never been a
      socialist; he was only a

      Trudovik,[3]
      and he enlisted himself with the “Socialist-Revolutionaries”
      only in March 1917, when it was already safe and quite
      profitable to do so. Through Kerensky, as Deputy Chairman of the
      Petrograd Soviet, the capitalist Provisional Government
      immediately set about gaining control of and taming the
      Soviet. The Soviet, i.e., the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
      Mensheviks who predominated in it, allowed itself to be

    

tamed,
      agreeing immediately after the formation of the capitalist
      Provisional Government to "support it" – "to the extent" that
      it carried out its promises.
    

The Soviet regarded itself as a body verifying and exercising
      control over the activities of the Provisional Government. The
      leaders of the Soviet established what was known as a Contact
      Commission to keep in touch with the
      government.[4] Within that
      Contact Commission, the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
      leaders of the Soviet held continuous negotiations with the
      capitalist government, holding, properly speaking, the status of
      Ministers without portfolio or unofficial Ministers.
    

This state of affairs lasted throughout March and almost the
      whole of April. Seeking to gain time, the capitalists resorted
      to delays and subterfuges. Not a single step of any importance
      to further the revolution was taken by the capitalist government
      during this period. It did absolutely nothing even to further
      its direct and immediate task, the convocation of the
      Constituent Assembly; it did not submit the question to the
      localities or even set up a central commission to handle the
      preparations. The government was concerned with only one thing,
      namely, surreptitiously renewing the predatory international
      treaties concluded by the tsar with the capitalists of Britain
      and France, thwarting the revolution as cautiously and quietly
      as possible, and promising everything without fulfilling any of
      its promises. The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in
      the Contact Commission acted like simpletons who were fed on
      fancy phrases, promises, and more promises. Like the crow in the
      fable, the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks succumbed to
      flattery and listened with pleasure to the assurances of the
      capitalists that they valued the Soviets highly and did not take
      a single step without them.
    

But time passed and the capitalist government did absolutely
      nothing for the revolution. On the contrary, during this period
      it managed, to the detriment of the revolution, to renew the
      secret predatory treaties, or, rather, to reaffirm them and
      “vitalise” them by supplementary and no less secret negotiations
      with Anglo-French imperialist diplomats. During this period it
      managed, to the detriment of the revolution, to lay the
      foundations of a counter-revolutionary

    

organisation of (or at
      least of a rapprochement among) the generals and officers in the
      army in the field. To the detriment of the revolution it managed
      to start the organisation of industrialists, of factory-owners,
      who, under the onslaught of the workers, were compelled to make
      concession after concession, but who at the same time began to
      sabotage (damage) production and prepare to bring it to a
      standstill when the opportunity came.
    

However, the organisation of the advanced workers and peasants
      in the Soviets made steady progress. The foremost
      representatives of the oppressed classes felt that, in spite of
      the agreement between the government and the Petrograd Soviet,
      in spite of Kerensky’s pompous talk, in spite of the "Contact
      Commission", the government remained an enemy of the people, an
      enemy of the revolution. The people felt that unless the
      resistance of the capitalists was broken, the cause of peace,
      liberty and the revolution, would inevitably be lost. The
      impatience and bitterness of the people kept on growing.
    
VI

It burst out on April 20–21. The movement flared up
      spontaneously; nobody had cleared the ground for it. The
      movement was so markedly directed against the government that
      one regiment even appeared fully armed at the Marinsky Palace to
      arrest the ministers. It became perfectly obvious to everybody
      that the government could not retain power. The Soviets could
      (and should) have taken over power with out meeting the least
      resistance from any quarter. Instead, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks supported the
      collapsing capitalist government, entangled themselves even
      further in compromises with it and took steps that were even
      more fatal to the revolution, that tended to lead to its
      doom.
    

Revolution enlightens all classes with a rapidity and
      thoroughness unknown in normal, peaceful times. The capitalists,
      better organised and more experienced than anybody else in
      matters of class struggle and politics, learnt their lesson
      quicker than the others. Realising that the government’s
      position was hopeless, they resorted to a method which for many
      decades, ever since 1848, has been practised

    

by the capitalists
      of other countries in order to fool, divide and weaken the
      workers. This method is known as a “coalition” government, i.e.,
      a joint cabinet formed of members of the bourgeoisie and
      turncoats from socialism.
    

In countries where freedom and democracy have long existed side
      by side with a revolutionary labour movement, in Britain and
      France, the capitalists have repeatedly and very successfully
      resorted to this method. When the “socialist” leaders entered a
      bourgeois cabinet, they invariably proved to be figureheads,
      puppets, screens for the capitalists, instruments for deceiving
      the workers. The "democratic and republican" capitalists of
      Russia resorted to this very method. The
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks let themselves be
      fooled at once, and the “coalition” cabinet, joined by Chernov,
      Tsereteli and Co., became a fact on May 6.
    

The simpletons of the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
      parties were jubilant and fatuously bathed in the rays of the
      ministerial glory of their leaders. The capitalists gleefully
      rubbed their hands at having found helpers against the people in
      the persons of the "leaders of the Soviets" and at having
      secured their promise to support "offensive operations at the
      front", i.e., a resumption of the imperialist predatory war,
      which had come to a standstill for a while. The capitalists were
      well aware of the puffed-up impotence of these leaders, they
      knew that the promises of the bourgeoisie – regarding control
      over production, and even the organisation of production,
      regarding a peace policy, and so forth – would never be
      fulfilled.
    

And so it turned out. The second phase in the development of the
      revolution, May 6 to June 9, or June 18, fully corroborated the
      expectations of the capitalists as to the ease with which the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks could be fooled.
    

While Peshekhonov and Skobelev were deceiving themselves and the
      people with florid speeches to the effect that one hundred per
      cent of the profits of the capitalists would be taken away from
      them, that their "resistance was broken", and so forth, the
      capitalists continued to consolidate their position. Nothing,
      absolutely nothing, was undertaken during this period to curb
      the capitalists. The ministerial turncoats from socialism proved
      to be mere talking machines

    

for distracting the attention of the
      oppressed classes, while the entire apparatus of state
      administration actually remained in the hands of the bureaucracy
      (the officialdom) and the bourgeoisie. The notorious Palchinsky,
      Deputy Minister for Industry, was a typical representative of
      that apparatus, blocking every measure against the
      capitalists. While the ministers prated everything remained as
      of old.
    

The bourgeoisie used Minister Tsereteli in particular to fight
      the revolution. He was sent to “pacify” Kronstadt when the local
      revolutionaries had the audacity to remove an appointed
      commissar.[5]
      The bourgeoisie launched in their newspapers an
      incredibly vociferous, violent and vicious campaign of lies,
      slander and vituperation against Kronstadt, accusing it of the
      desire "to secede from Russia", and repeating this and similar
      absurdities in a thousand ways to intimidate the petty
      bourgeoisie and the philistines. A most typically stupid and
      frightened philistine, Tsereteli, was the most “conscientious”
      of all in swallowing the bait of bourgeois slander; he was the
      most zealous of all in "smashing up and subduing" Kronstadt,
      without realising that he was playing the role of a lackey of
      the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie. He turned out to be the
      instrument of the “compromise” arrived at with revolutionary
      Kronstadt, whereby the commissar for Kronstadt was not simply
      appointed by
      the government, but was elected locally and was
      confirmed by the government. It was on such miserable
      compromises that the ministers who had deserted socialism for
      the bourgeoisie wasted their time.
    

Wherever a bourgeois minister could not appear in defence of the
      government, before the revolutionary workers or in the Soviets,
      Skobelev, Tsereteli, Chernov or some other “socialist” Minister
      appeared (or, to be precise, was sent by the bourgeoisie) and
      faithfully performed their assignment; he would do his level
      best to defend the Cabinet, whitewash the capitalists and fool
      the people by making promise after promise and by advising
      people to wait, wait and wait.
    

Minister Chernov particularly was engaged in bargaining with his
      bourgeois colleagues; down to July, to the new "crisis of power"
      which began after the movement of July 3-4, to the resignation
      of the Cadets from the Cabinet, Minister Chernov was
      continuously engaged in the useful and

    

interesting work, so
      beneficial to the people, of “persuading” his bourgeois
      colleagues, exhorting them to agree at least to prohibition of
      the purchase and sale of land. This prohibition had been most
      solemnly promised to the peasants at the All-Russia Congress of
      Peasant Deputies in Petrograd. But the promise remained only a
      promise. Chernov proved unable to fulfil it either in May or in
      June, until the revolutionary tide, the spontaneous outbreak of
      July 3-4, which coincided with the resignation of the Cadets
      from the Cabinet, made it possible to enact this measure. Even
      then, however, it proved to be an isolated measure, incapable of
      promoting to any palpable extent the struggle of the peasants
      against the landowners for land.
    

Meanwhile, at the front, the counter-revolutionary, imperialist
      task of resuming the imperialist, predatory war, a task which
      Guchkov, so hated by the people, had been unable to accomplish,
      was being accomplished successfully and brilliantly by the
      "revolutionary democrat" Kerensky, that new-baked member of the
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party. He revelled in his own eloquence,
      incense was burned to him by the imperialists, who were using
      him as a pawn, he was flattered and worshipped – all because he
      served the capitalists faithfully, trying to talk the
      "revolutionary troops" into agreeing to resume the war being
      waged in pursuance of the treaties concluded by Tsar Nicholas II
      with the capitalists of Britain and France, a war waged so that
      Russian capitalists might secure Constantinople and Lvov,
      Erzurum and Trebizond.
    

So passed the second phase of the Russian revolution – May 6 to
      June 9. Shielded and defended by the “socialist” Ministers, the
      counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie grew in strength, consolidated
      their position and prepared an offensive both against the
      external enemy and against the internal enemy, i.e., the
      revolutionary workers.
    
VII

On June 9, the revolutionary workers’ party, the Bolsheviks, was
      preparing for a demonstration in Petrograd to give organised
      expression to the irresistibly growing popular discontent and
      indignation. The Socialist-Revolutionary and

    

Menshevik leaders,
      entangled in compromises with the bourgeoisie and bound by the
      imperialist policy of an offensive, were horrified, feeling that
      they were losing their influence among the masses. A general
      howl went up against the demonstration, and the
      counter-revolutionary Cadets joined in this howl, this time
      together with the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
      Mensheviks. Under their direction, and as a result of their
      policy of compromise with the capitalists, the swing of the
      petty-bourgeois masses to an alliance with the
      counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie became quite definite and
      strikingly obvious. This is the historical significance and
      class meaning of the crisis of June 9.
    

The Bolsheviks called off the demonstration, having no wish to
      lead the workers at that moment into a losing fight against the
      united Cadets, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. The
      latter, however, so as to retain at least a vestige of the
      people’s confidence, were compelled to call a general
      demonstration for June 48. The bourgeoisie were beside
      themselves with rage, rightly discerning in this a swing of the
      petty-bourgeois democrats towards the proletariat, and they
      decided to paralyse the action of the democrats by an offensive
      at the front.
    

In fact, June 18 was marked by an impressive victory for the
      slogans of the revolutionary proletariat, the slogans of
      Bolshevism, among the people of Petrograd. And on June 19 the
      bourgeoisie and the
      Bonapartist[1]

      Kerensky solemnly announced that the
      offensive at the front had begun on June 18.
    

The offensive meant in effect the resumption of the predatory
      war in the interests of the capitalists and against the will of
      the vast majority of the working people. That is why the
      offensive was inevitably accompanied, on the one hand, by a
      gigantic growth of chauvinism and the transfer of military power
      (and consequently of state power) to the military gang of
      Bonapartists, and, on the other, by the use

    

of violence against
      the masses, the persecution of the inter nationalists, the
      abolition of freedom of agitation, and the arrest and 9hooting
      of those who were against the war.
    

Whereas May 6 bound the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks to the triumphal
      chariot of the bourgeoisie with a rope, June 19 shackled them,
      as servants of the capitalists, with a chain.
    
VIII

Owing to the resumption of the predatory war, the bitterness of
      the people naturally grew even more rapidly and intensely. July
      3–4 witnessed an outburst of their anger which the Bolsheviks
      attempted to restrain and which, of course, they had to
      endeavour to make as organised as possible.
    

The Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, being slaves of
      the bourgeoisie, shackled by their master, agreed to everything:
      dispatching reactionary troops to Petrograd, bringing back the
      death penalty, disarming the workers and revolutionary troops,
      arresting and hounding, and closing down newspapers without
      trial. The power which the bourgeoisie in the government were
      unable to take entirely, and which the Soviets did not want to
      take, fell into the hands of the military clique, the
      Bonapartists, who, of course, were wholly backed by the Cadets
      and the Black Hundreds, by the landowners and capitalists.
    

Down the ladder, step by step. Having once set foot on the
      ladder of compromise with the bourgeoisie, the Socialist
      Revolutionaries and Mensheviks slid irresistibly downwards, to
      rock bottom. On February 28, in the Petrograd Soviet, they
      promised conditional support to the bourgeois government. On May
      6 they saved it from collapse and allowed themselves to be made
      its servants and defenders by agreeing to an offensive. On June
      9 they united with the counter revolutionary bourgeoisie in a
      campaign of furious rage, lies and slander against the
      revolutionary proletariat. On June 19 they approved the
      resumption of the predatory war. On July 3 they consented to the
      summoning of reactionary troops, which was the beginning of
      their complete surrender of power to the Bonapartists. Down the
      ladder, step by step.
    
 

This shameful finale of the
      Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties was not fortuitous
      but a consequence of the economic status of the small owners,
      the petty bourgeoisie, as has been repeatedly borne out by
      experience in Europe.
    
IX

Everybody, of course, has seen the small owner bend every effort
      and strain every nerve to "get on in the world", to become a
      real master, to rise to the position of a “strong” employer, to
      the position of a bourgeois. As long as capitalism rules the
      roost, there is no alternative for the small owner other than
      becoming a capitalist (and that is possible at best in the case
      of one small owner out of a hundred), or becoming a ruined man,
      a semi-proletarian, and ultimately a proletarian. The same is
      true in politics: the petty-bourgeois democrats, especially
      their leaders, tend to trail after the bourgeoisie. The leaders
      of the petty-bourgeois democrats console their people with
      promises and assurances about the possibility of reaching
      agreement with the big capitalists; at best, and for a very
      brief period, they obtain certain minor concessions from the
      capitalists for a small upper section of the working people; but
      on every decisive issue, on every important matter, the
      petty-bourgeois democrats have always tailed after the
      bourgeoisie as a feeble appendage to them, as an obedient tool
      in the hands of he financial mangates. The experience of Britain
      and France has proved this over and over again.
    

The experience of the Russian revolution from February to July
      1917, when events developed with unusual rapidity, particularly
      under the influence of the imperialist war and the deep-going
      crisis brought about by it, has most strikingly and palpably
      confirmed the old Marxist truth that the position of the petty
      bourgeoisie is unstable.
    

The lesson of the Russian revolution is that there can be no
      escape for the working people from the iron grip of war, famine,
      and enslavement by the landowners and capitalists unless they
      completely break with the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
      parties and clearly understand the latter’s treacherous role,
      unless they renounce all compromises with the bourgeoisie and
      resolutely side with the revolutionary

    

workers. Only the
      revolutionary workers, if supported by the peasant poor, are
      capable of smashing the resistance of the capitalists and
      leading the people in gaining land with out compensation,
      complete liberty, victory over famine and the war, and a just
      and lasting peace.
    
Afterword

This article was written at the end of July, as is apparent from
      the text.
    

The history of the revolution during August has fully
      corroborated what is said in this article. Then, at the end of
      August, the Kornilov
      revolt[6]
      caused a new turn in the revolution by clearly
      demonstrating to the whole people that the Cadets, in alliance
      with the counter-revolutionary generals, were striving to
      disband the Soviets and restore the monarchy. The near future
      will show how strong this new turn of the revolution is, and
      whether it will succeed in putting an end to the fatal policy of
      compromise with the bourgeoisie.

Notes
 

[1]
Bonapartism (from Bonaparte, the name of the two French
      emperors) is a name applied to a government which endeavours to
      appear non-partisan by taking advantage of a highly acute
      struggle between the parties of the capitalists and the
      workers. Actually serving the capitalists, such a government
      dupes the workers most of all by promises and petty concessions.
    —Lenin
 



[2]
On July 12 (25) the Provisional Government introduced capital
punishment at the front. The divisional “military revolutionary
tribunals” that were set up passed sentences which became effective
immediately and were executed without delay.





[3]
The Trudoviks (Trudovik group) were a Duma group of
petty-bourgeois democrats—peasants and intellectuals with Narodnik
leanings. The group was formed by the peasant Deputies to the
First Duma in April 1906. In the Duma it wavered between the
Cadets and the revolutionary Social-Democrats. During the First
World War most of the Trudoviks adhered to a social-chauvinist
position.

After the February revolution the Trudoviks, expressing the
interests of the kulaks, actively supported the Provisional
Government. Their reaction to the October Revolution was hostile and
they took part in the counter-revolutionary activities of the
bourgeoisie.





[4]
The Contact Commission was formed by decision of the compromising
Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet on March 8 (21) to
“influence” and “exercise control over” the activity of the
Provisional Government. Its members were M. I. Skobelev, Y. M.
Steklov, N. N. Sukhanov, V. N. Filippovsky and N. S. Chkheidze
(subsequently V. M. Chernov and I. G. Tsereteli were included).
The Commission helped the Provisional Government take
advantage of the prestige of the Petrograd Soviet to disguise its
counter-revolutionary policies. The Mensheviks and Socialist–
Revolutionaries hoped with its aid to keep the people from revolutionary action
aimed at effecting the transfer of power to the Soviets. The
Commission was abolished in the middle of April 1917, its functions
being handed over to the Executive Committee’s Bureau.





[5]
On May 17 (30), 1917, in view of a conflict between the Kronstadt
Soviet and Pepelayev, the Provisional Government Commissar,
the non-affiliated section of the Soviet passed a resolution
abolishing the office of government commissar and investing the Kronstadt
Soviet with full powers. The resolution, supported by the
Bolsheviks, said that the only authority in Kronstadt was the Soviet of
Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, which should enter into direct
contact with the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’
Deputies on all matters affecting the state.

The bourgeois, S.R. and Menshevik press launched a slander
campaign against the people of Kronstadt and the Bolsheviks,
alleging that Russia had begun to disintegrate, that a state of
anarchy was in, that Kronstadt had seceded, and so on.

First the Petrograd Soviet and then the Provisional
Government sent delegations (Chkheidze, Gotz and others in the former

   

case and the Ministers Skobelev and Tsereteli in the latter) to deal
with the Kronstadt incident. In the Kronstadt Soviet the two
Ministers succeeded in putting through a compromise decision
stipulating that the commissar be elected by the Soviet and his
election confirmed by the Provisional Government. A political
resolution was also passed, saying that the Kronstadt Soviet
recognised the authority of the Provisional Government but adding
that this “recognition certainly does not rule out criticism and the
desire that the revolutionary democrats should form a new central
authority and transfer all power to the Soviet of Workers’ and
Soldiers’ Deputies”. =

The resolution expressed the hope that the
Bolsheviks would achieve this by exerting ideological influence.
It ended with an emphatic protest against attempts to attribute to
the Kronstadt Bolsheviks “the intention of severing Kronstadt
from the rest of Russia”.





[6]
The Kornilov revolt against the revolution was organised by the
bourgeoisie and landowners in August 1917. It was led by the tsarist
general Kornilov, then Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Army.
The conspirators aimed at capturing Petrograd, smashing the
Bolshevik Party, disbanding the Soviets, establishing a military
dictatorship, and paving the way for the restoration of the
monarchy. A. F. Kerensky, head of the Provisional Government, joined
in the conspiracy. However, when the revolt began, ho dissociated
himself from Kornilov, fearing that he might be swept away with
Kornilov, and declared Kornilov to be a rebel against the
Provisional Government.

The revolt began on August 25 (September 7). Kornilov marched
the Third Cavalry Corps against Petrograd. In Petrograd itself,
the counter-revolutionary organisations of Kornilov’s backers were
getting ready for action.

The Bolshevik Party led the people against Kornilov as it
continued, in accordance with Lenin’s recommendation, to expose
the Provisional Government and its S.R. and Menshevik
hangers-on. In response to the call of the Bolshevik Party’s Central
Committee, the workers of Petrograd and the revolutionary soldiers
and sailors rose to fight the rebels. The Petrograd workers promptly
formed Red Guard units. Revolutionary committees were set up
in several localities. The advance of the Kornilov troops was
checked and Bolshevik propaganda began to demoralise them.

The Kornilov revolt was put down by the workers and peasants
under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party. Under pressure from
the people, the Provisional Government had to order the arrest
and trial of Kornilov and his accomplices.

It is possible that these lines will come too late, for
    events are developing with a rapidity that sometimes makes one’s head
    spin. I am writing this on Wednesday, August 30, and the recipients will
    read it no earlier than Friday, September 2. Still, on chance, I consider
    it my duty to write the following.

The Kornilov revolt is a most unexpected (unexpected at such a moment
    and in such a form) and downright unbelievably sharp turn in events.

Like every sharp turn, it calls for a revision and change of tactics.
    And as with every revision, we must be extra-cautious not to become
    unprincipled.

It is my conviction that those who become unprincipled are people who
    (like Volodarsky) slide into defencism or (like other Bolsheviks) into a
    bloc with the S.R.s, into supporting the Provisional
    Government. Their attitude is absolutely wrong and unprincipled. We shall
    become defencists only after the transfer of power to the
    proletariat, after a peace offer, after the secret
    treaties and ties with the banks have been broken—only
    afterwards. Neither the capture of Riga nor the capture of
    Petrograd will make us defencists. (I should very much like Volodarsky
    to read this.) Until then we stand for a proletarian revolution, we are
    against the war, and we are no defencists.

Even now we must not support Kerensky’s government. This
    is unprincipled. We may be asked: aren’t we going to fight against
    Kornilov? Of course we must! But this is not the same thing; there is a
    dividing Line here, which is being stepped over by some Bolsheviks who fall
    into

    

compromise and allow themselves to be carried away by the
    course of events.

We shall fight, we are fighting against Kornilov, just as
    Kerensky’s troops do, but we do not support Kerensky. On
    the contrary, we expose his weakness. There is the difference. It is
    rather a subtle difference, but it is highly essential.and must not be
    forgotten.

What, then, constitutes our change of tactics after the Kornilov
    revolt?

We are changing the form of our struggle against Kerensky.
    Without in the least relaxing our hostility towards him, without taking
    back a single word said against him, without renouncing the task of
    overthrowing him, we say that we must take into account the
    present situation. We shall not overthrow Kerensky right now. We shall
    approach the task of fighting against him in a different way,
    namely, we shall point out to the people (who are fighting against
    Kornilov) Kerensky’s weakness and vacillation. That
    has been done in the past as well. Now, however, it has become the
    all-important thing and this constitutes the change.

The change, further, is that the all-important thing now has
    become the intensification of our campaign for some kind of “partial
    demands” to be presented to Kerensky: arrest Milyukov, arm the
    Petrograd workers, summon the Kronstadt, Vyborg and Helsingfors troops to
    Petrograd, dissolve the Duma, arrest Rodzyanko, legalise the transfer of
    the landed estates to the peasants, introduce workers’ control over
    grain and factories, etc., etc. We must present these demands not only to
    Kerensky, and not so much to Kerensky, as to the workers, soldiers
    and peasants who have been carried away by the course of the
    struggle against Kornilov. We must keep up their enthusiasm,
    encourage them to deal with the generals and officers who have declared for
    Kornilov, urge them to demand the immediate transfer of land to
    the peasants, suggest to them that it is necessary to arrest
    Rodzyanko and Milyukov, dissolve the Duma, close down Rech and
    other bourgeois papers, and institute investigations against them. The
    “Left” S.R.s must be especially urged on in this direction.





It would be wrong to think that we have moved farther away from the task
    of the proletariat winning power. No.

    

We have come very close to it,
    not directly, but from the side. At the moment we must
    campaign not so much directly against Kerensky, as indirectly
    against him, namely, by demanding a more and more active, truly
    revolutionary war against Kornilov. The development of this war alone can
    lead us to power, but we must speak of this its little as
    possible in our propaganda (remembering very well that even tomorrow events
    may put power into our hands, and then we shall not relinquish it). It
    seems to me that this should be passed on in a letter (not in the papers)
    to the propagandists, to groups of agitators and propagandists, and to
    Party members in general. We must relentlessly fight against phrases about
    the defence of the country, about a united front of revolutionary
    democrats, about supporting the provisional Government, etc., etc., since
    they are just empty phrases. We must say: now is the time for
    action; you S.R. and Menshevik gentlemen have long since worn
    those phrases threadbare. Now is the time for action; the war
    against Kornilov must be conducted in a revolutionary way, by drawing the
    masses in, by arousing them, by inflaming them (Kerensky is afraid
    of the masses, afraid of the people). In the war against the
    Germans, action is required right now; immediate and
    unconditional peace must be offered on precise terms. If this
    is done, either a speedy peace can be attained or the war can be
    turned into a revolutionary war; if not, all the Mensheviks and
    Socialist-Revolutionaries remain lackeys of imperialism.


P.S. Having read six issues of 
Rabochy,[1] after this was
    written, I must say that our views fully coincide. I heartily welcome the
    splendid editorials, press review and articles by V. M—n and
    Vol—y. As to Volodarsky’s speech, I have read his letter to the
    editors, which likewise “eliminates” my reproaches. Once more,
    best wishes and greetings!

## On Compromises











On Compromises



V. I. Lenin
On Compromises[1]


Written:  March-April, 1920
First Published: 1936; Published according to the manuscript
Source: Lenin’s Collected Works, 4th English Edition, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1965, Volume 30, pages 491-493

In a talk with me, Comrade Lansbury laid particular stress on the following argument of the British opportunist leaders in the labour movement.
The Bolsheviks are compromising with the capitalists, agreeing, in the Peace Treaty with Estonia, for instance, to timber concessions; if that is the case, compromises with capitalists concluded by the moderate leaders of the British labour movement are equally legitimate.
Comrade Lansbury considers this argument, very widespread in Britain, of importance to the workers and urgently requiring examination.
I shall try to meet this desire.

May an advocate of proletarian revolution conclude compromises with capitalists or with the capitalist class?
This, apparently, is the question underlying the above argument. But to present it in this general way shows either the extreme political inexperience and low level of political consciousness of the questioner, or his chicanery in using a sophism to veil his justification of brigandage, plunder and every other sort of capitalist violence.
Indeed, it would obviously be silly to give a negative reply to this general question. Of course, an advocate of proletarian revolution may conclude compromises or agreements with capitalists. It all depends on what kind of agreement is concluded and under what circumstances. Here  and here alone can and must one look for the difference between an agreement that is legitimate from the angle of the proletarian revolution and one that is treasonable, treacherous (from the same angle).
To make this clear I shall first recall the argument of the. founders of Marxism and then add some very simple and obvious examples.
It is not. for nothing that Marx and Engels are considered the founders of scientific socialism. They were ruthless enemies of all phrase-mongering. They taught that problems of socialism (including problems of socialist tactics) must be presented scientifically. In the seventies of last century, when Engels analysed the revolutionary manifesto of the French Blanquists, Commune fugitives, he told them in plain terms that their boastful declaration of "no compromise" was an empty phrase.[2] The idea of compromises must not he renounced. The point is through all the compromises which are sometimes necessarily imposed by force of circumstance upon even the most revolutionary party of even the most revolutionary class, to be able to preserve, strengthen, steel and develop the revolutionary tactics and organisation, the revolutionary consciousness, determination and preparedness of the working class and its organised vanguard, the Communist Party.
Anybody acquainted with. the fundamentals of Marx's teachings must inevitably draw this conclusion from the totality of those teachings. But since in Britain, due to a number of historical causes, Marxism has ever since Chartism" (which in many respects was something preparatory to Marxism, the "last word but one" before Marxism) been pushed into the background by the opportunist, semi-bourgeois leaders of the trade unions and co-operatives, I shall try to explain the truth of the view expounded by means of typical examples drawn from among the universally known facts of ordinary, political, and economic life.
I shall begin with an illustration I gave once before in one of my speeches. Let us suppose the car you are travelling in is attacked by armed bandits. Let us suppose that when a pistol is put to your temple you surrender your car, money and revolver to the bandits, who proceed to use this car, etc., to commit other robberies.
Here is undoubtedly a case of compromising with highwaymen, of agreement with them. The agreement., though unsigned and tacitly concluded, is nevertheless quite a definite and precise one: "I give you, Mr. Robber, my car, weapon and money; you rid me of your pleasant company."
The question arises: do you call the man who concluded such an agreement with highwaymen an accomplice in banditry, an accomplice in a robbers' assault upon third persons despoiled by the bandits with the aid of the car, money and weapon received by them from the person who concluded this agreement?
No, you do not.
The matter is absolutely plain and simple, down to the smallest detail.
And it is likewise clear that under other circumstances the tacit surrender to the highwaymen of the car, money and weapon would be considered by every person of common sense to be complicity in banditry.
The conclusion is clear: it is just as silly to renounce the idea of literally all agreements or compromises with robbers as it is to acquit a person of complicity in banditry on the basis of the abstract proposition that, generally speaking, agreements with robbers are sometimes permissible and necessary.
Let us now take a political illustration ....

The Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P., on the basis of the
    resolution on the political situation adopted by the Sixth
    Congress of the R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks), and applying that
    resolution to the present situation, at its plenary meeting
    states:

1. In the two months from July 3 to September 3, due to
    the unparalleled speed of the revolution, the course of the class
    struggle and the development of political events have carried the
    whole country as far forward as it would have been impossible for
    the country to advance over many years in peace-time, without
    revolution and war.

2. It becomes more and more apparent that the events of
    July 3-5 were the turning-point of the whole revolution. Without a
    correct estimate of these events, it is impossible to correctly
    estimate either the proletariat’s tasks, or the speed of
    development of revolutionary events, which is beyond our
    control.

3. The slander against the Bolsheviks, which the
    bourgeoisie spread with tremendous zeal and which they put about
    very widely among the people with the aid of the millions invested
    in capitalist papers and publishing houses, is being exposed more
    and more rapidly and widely. First it was the workers in the
    capital and in the large cities, and then the peasants, who
    realised more and more that the slander against the Bolsheviks is
    one of the main weapons used by the landowners and capitalists in
    the struggle against the defenders of the interests of the workers
    and poor peasants, i.e., against the Bolsheviks.
 

4. An outright attempt was made to camouflage the Kornilov
    revolt, i.e., a revolt of generals and officers behind whom stand
    the landowners and the capitalists headed by the Cadet Party (the
    “people’s freedom” party), by bringing up again the old
    slander against the Bolsheviks. It was this that helped finally to
    open the eyes of the broadest sections of the people to the true
    meaning of the bourgeois slander against the Bolshevik workers’
    party, the party of the true defenders of the poor.

5. Had our Party refused to support the July 3–4 mass movement,
    which burst out spontaneously despite our attempts to prevent it,
    we should have actually and completely betrayed the proletariat,
    since the people were moved to action by their well-founded and
    just anger at the protraction of the imperialist war, which is a
    predatory war conducted in the interests of the capitalists, and
    at the inaction of the government and the Soviets in regard to the
    bourgeoisie, who are intensifying and aggravating economic
    disruption and famine.

6. In spite of all the efforts of the bourgeoisie and the
    government, in spite of the arrest of hundreds of Bolsheviks, the
    seizure of their papers and documents, the search of their
    editorial offices, etc.—in spite of all this nobody has
    succeeded, and nobody will ever succeed, in proving the slander
    that our Party’s aim in the July 3-4 movement was anything other
    than a “peaceful and organised” demonstration with the
    slogan of transfer of all state power to the Soviets of Workers’,
    Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies.

7. It would have been wrong if the Bolsheviks had aimed to seize
    power on July 3-4, since neither the majority of the people nor
    even the majority of the workers at that time had yet actually
    experienced the counter-revolutionary policies of generals in the
    army, of the landowners in the countryside, and of the capitalists
    in the town. These policies were only revealed to the masses after
    July 5, and stemmed from a compromise between the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, on the one hand, and the
    bourgeoisie, on the other. None of our Party organisations, either
    central or local, advocated, either in writing or by word of
    mouth, the slogan of seizing power on July 3-4; none of them even
    discussed this question.
 

8. The real mistake of our Party on July 3-4, as events now
    reveal, was merely that the Party considered the general situation
      in the country less revolutionary than it proved to be, that the
      Party still considered a peaceful development of political changes
    possible through an alteration in the Soviets’ policies, whereas
    in reality the Mensheviks and S.R.s had become so much entangled
    and bound by compromising with the bourgeoisie, and the
    bourgeoisie had become so counter-revolutionary, that peaceful
    development was no longer possible. This erroneous view, however,
    which was sustained only by the hope that events would not develop
    too fast, our Party could not have got over other than by
    participating in the popular movement of July 3-4 with the slogan
    “All power to the Soviets” and with the aim of making the
    movement peaceful and organised.

9. The historic significance of the Kornilov revolt is that
    with extraordinary force, it opened the people’s eyes to a fact
    which the S.R.s and Mensheviks had concealed and still are
    concealing under conciliatory phrases. The fact is that the
    landowners and the bourgeoisie, headed by the Cadet Party, and the
    generals and officers who are on their side, have organised
    themselves; they are ready to commit, or are committing, the most
    outrageous crimes, such as surrendering Riga (followed by
    Petrograd) to the Germans, laying the war front open, putting the
    Bolshevik regiments under fire, starting a mutiny, leading troops
    against the capital with the “Savage
      Division”[2]
      at
    their head, etc. The purpose of all this is to seize power
    completely and put it in the hands of the bourgeoisie, to
    consolidate the power of the landowners in the countryside, and to
    drench the country in the blood of workers and peasants.

The Kornilov revolt has proved for Russia what has been proved
    throughout history for all countries, namely, that the bourgeoisie
    will betray their country and commit any crime to retain both
    their power over the people and their profits.

10. The workers and peasants of Russia have no other
      alternative than the most determined struggle against, and victory
      over, the landowners and the bourgeoisie, over the Cadet Party and
      the generals and officers sympathising with it. Only the urban
      working class can lead the people, i.e., all working people, into
      such a struggle and to such a

    

victory, provided all state power
      passes into its hands and provided it is supported by the peasant
      poor.

11. Events in the Russian revolution, particularly since
    May 6, and even more so since July 3, have been developing with
    such incredible, storm- or hurricane-like velocity, that it can by
    no means be the task of the Party to speed them up. All efforts,
    in fact, must be directed towards keeping up with events and doing
    on time our work of explaining to the workers, and to the working
    people in general, as much as we can, the changes in the situation
    and in the course of the class struggle. This is still the main
    task of our Party; we must explain to the people that the
    situation is extremely critical, that every action may end in an
    explosion, and that therefore a premature uprising may cause the
    greatest harm. At the same time, the critical situation is
    inevitably leading the working class—perhaps with catastrophic
    speed—to a situation in which, due to a change in events beyond
    its control, it will find itself compelled to wage a determined
    battle with the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie and to gain
    power.

12. The Kornilov revolt fully revealed that the entire
      army
      hates the General Staff.
      This had to be admitted even by
    those Mensheviks and S.R.s who through months of effort had proved
    their hatred for the Bolsheviks and their defence of the policy of
    agreement between the workers and peasants, on the one hand, and
    the landowners and the bourgeoisie, on the other. The hatred of
    the army for the General Staff will not die down but will become
    stronger now that Kerensky’s government has confined itself to
    substituting Alexeyev for Kornilov, leaving Klembovsky and other
    Kornilov generals, and has done absolutely nothing substantial to
    democratise the armed forces and remove the counter-revolutionary
    commanders. Soviets, which tolerate and support this weak,
    wavering, unprincipled policy of Kerensky and missed another
    opportunity to take all power peacefully when the Kornilov revolt
    was being liquidated, become guilty not only of conciliation but
    even of criminal conciliation.

The army, which hates the General Staff and does not want to
    fight a war it now knows to be a war of conquest, is inevitably
    doomed to new catastrophes.
 

13. Only the working class, when it has gained power, will
    be able to pursue a peace policy, not merely in words, like the
    Mensheviks and S.R.s, who in practice support the bourgeoisie and
    their secret treaties, but in deeds. Specifically, the working
    class will immediately offer all peoples open, precise, clear and
      just peace terms. This will be done irrespective of the military
      situation, even if Kornilov’s generals follow up the surrender of
      Riga by that of Petrograd. The working class can do this in the
      name of the entire people, since the overwhelming majority of
      Russia’s workers and peasants oppose the present war of annexation
      and support a peace on just terms, without annexations and
      indemnities.

The S.R.s and Mensheviks are deceiving themselves and the
    people when they spend months talking about this peace. The
    working class, on gaining power, will offer this peace to all
    without losing a single day.

The capitalists of all countries have so much difficulty in
    stemming the workers’ revolution against war—a revolution which
    is growing everywhere—that if the Russian revolution were to
    pass from impotent and pitiful yearning for peace to a forthright
    peace offer coupled with the publication and annulment of secret
    treaties, etc., there are ninety-nine chances in a hundred that
    peace would quickly follow, that the capitalists would be unable
    to stand in the way of peace.

If, however, the highly improbable were to happen and the
    capitalists were to reject the peace terms of the Russian workers’
    government, against the will of their peoples, a revolution in
    Europe would come a hundred times nearer, and our workers’ and
    peasants’ army would elect for itself not hated but respected
    commanders and military leaders. The army would see the justice of
    the war once peace had been offered, the secret treaties torn up,
    the alliance with the landowners and the bourgeoisie severed, and
    all land given to the peasants. Only then would the war become a
    just war for Russia, only this war would the workers and peasants
    fight of their own free will, without being bludgeoned into
    fighting; and this war would bring even nearer the inevitable
    workers’ revolution in the advanced countries.
 

14. Only the working class, when it has gained power, will be
    able to guarantee the immediate transfer of all landed estates to
    the peasants without compensation. This must not be put off. The
    Constituent Assembly will legalise the transfer, but it is not the
    peasants’ fault that the Constituent Assembly is being
    delayed. The peasants daily become more convinced that it is
    impossible to get the land by agreement with the landowners and
    the capitalists. The land can only be obtained through a very
    close, brotherly alliance of the poor peasants and the
    workers.

Chernov’s resignation from the government after he had for
    months tried to uphold the interests of the peasants through
    concessions, big and small, to the Cadet landowners, and after all
    these attempts had failed, revealed with particular clarity the
    hopelessness of the policy of conciliation. The peasants see, know
    and feel that since July 5 the landowners have become arrogant in
    the villages and that it is necessary to curb them and render them
    harmless..

15. Only the working class, when it has gained power, will be
    able to put an end to economic disruption and the impending
    famine. Since May 6 the government has kept on promising control,
    but it has done and could do nothing because the capitalists and
    landowners obstructed all work. Unemployment is growing, famine is
    approaching, currency is losing value. Peshekhonov’s resignation
    after the fixed prices have doubled will aggravate the crisis, and
    it again shows the utter feebleness and impotence of the
    government. Only workers’ control over production and distribution
    can save the situation. Only a workers’ government will curb the
    capitalists, will bring heroic support from all working people for
    the efforts of
      state power, and will establish order and a fair
    exchange of grain for manufactured goods.

16. The confidence of the peasant poor in the urban working
    class, temporarily undermined by the slander of the bourgeoisie
    and by hopes put in the policy of conciliation, has been
    returning, particularly after the arrests in the countryside and
    the various kinds of persecution of working people after July 5
    and then the Kornilov revolt opened the people’s eyes. One of the
    signs that the people are losing faith in conciliation with the
    capitalists is that among the S.R.s and Mensheviks, the two main
    parties responsible for

    

introducing this policy of conciliation
    and bringing it to a culmination, there have been growing,
    especially since July 5, a discontent within these parties and a
    struggle against conciliation. This opposition at the last
    Socialist-Revolutionary “Council” and at the Menshevik
    congress involved about two-fifths (40 per cent) of the
    members.

17. The whole course of events, all economic and political
    conditions, everything that is happening in the armed forces, are
    increasingly paving the way for the successful winning of power by
    the working class, which will bring peace, bread and freedom and
    will hasten the victory of the proletarian revolution in other
    countries.

The “Draft Resolution on the Present Political Situation” was
written by Lenin for the plenary meeting of the Party’s Central
Committee set for September 3 (16). What took place on that date was
not a plenum but a regular meeting of the C.C., which did not
discuss the political situation. In the available records of the C.C.
R.S.D.L.P.(B.) for 1917 there is no indication of the draft having
been discussed by the Central Committee.

The key question of every revolution is undoubtedly the
      question of state power. Which class holds power decides
      everything. When
      Dyelo Naroda, the paper of the chief governing
      party in Russia, recently complained (No. 147) that, owing to
      the controversies over power, both the question of the
      Constituent Assembly and that of bread are being forgotten, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries should have been answered, “Blame
      yourselves. For it is the wavering and indecision of
      your party
      that are mostly to blame for ‘ministerial leapfrog’, the
      interminable postponements of the Constituent Assembly, and the
      undermining by the capitalists of the planned and agreed
      measures of a grain monopoly and of providing the country with
      bread.”

The question of power cannot be evaded or brushed aside,
    because it is the key question determining
      everything in a
    revolution’s development, and in its foreign and domestic
    policies. It is an undisputed fact that our revolution has
    “wasted” six months in wavering over the system of power; it
    is a fact resulting from the wavering policy of the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. In the long run, these
    parties’ wavering policy was determined by the class position of
    the petty bourgeoisie, by their economic instability in the
    struggle between capital and labour.

The whole issue at present is whether the petty-bourgeois
    democrats have learned anything during these great, exceptionally
    eventful six months. If not, then the revolution is lost, and only
    a victorious uprising of the proletariat can save it. If they have
    learned something, the establishment of a stable, unwavering power
    must be begun immediately.

    

Only if power is based, obviously and
    unconditionally,
      on a majority of the population can it be stable
    during a popular revolution, i.e., a revolution which rouses the
    people, the majority of the workers and peasants, to action. Up to
      now state power in Russia has
      virtually remained in the hands of
    the
      bourgeoisie, who are compelled to make only particular
    concessions (only to begin withdrawing them the following day), to
    hand out promises (only to fail to carry them out), to search for
    all sorts of excuses to cover their domination (only to fool the
    people by a show of “honest coalition”), etc., etc. In
    words it claims to be a popular, democratic, revolutionary
    government, but in deeds it is an anti-popular, undemocratic,
    counter-revolutionary, bourgeois government. This is the
    contradiction which has existed so far and which has been a source
    of the complete instability and inconsistency of power, of that
    “ministerial leapfrog” in which the S.R.s and Mensheviks
    have been engaged with such unfortunate (for the people)
    enthusiasm.

In early June 1917 1 told the All-Russia Congress of
Soviets[1]

    that either the Soviets would be dispersed and die an inglorious
    death, or all power must be transferred to them. The events of
    July and August very convincingly bore out these words. No matter
    what lies the lackeys of the bourgeoisie—Potresov, Plekhanov
    and others, who designate as “broadening the base” of power
    its virtual transfer to a tiny minority of the people, to the
    bourgeoisie, the exploiters—may resort to, only the power of
    the Soviets can be stable, obviously based on a majority of the
    people.

Only Soviet power could be stable and not be overthrown even in
    the stormiest moments of the stormiest revolution. Only this power
    could assure a continuous and broad development of the revolution,
    a peaceful struggle of parties within the Soviets. Until this
    power is created, there will inevitably be indecision,
    instability, vacillation, endless “crises of power”, a
    constant farce of ministerial leapfrog, outbreaks on the Right and
    on the Left.

The slogan, “Power to the Soviets”, however, is very
    often, if not in most cases, taken quite incorrectly to mean

    

a
    “Cabinet of the parties of the Soviet majority”. We would
    like to go into more detail on this very false notion.

A “Cabinet of the parties of the Soviet majority” means a
    change of individual ministers, with the entire old government
    apparatus left intact—a thoroughly bureaucratic and thoroughly
    undemocratic apparatus incapable of carrying out serious reforms,
    such as are contained even in the S.R. and Menshevik
    programmes.

“Power to the Soviets” means radically reshaping the
    entire old state apparatus, that bureaucratic apparatus which
    hampers everything democratic. It means removing this apparatus
    and substituting for it a new, popular one, i.e., a truly
    democratic apparatus of Soviets, i.e., the organised and armed
    majority of the people—the workers, soldiers and peasants. It
    means allowing the majority of the people initiative and
    independence not only in the election of deputies, but also in
    state administration, in effecting reforms and various other
    changes.

To make this difference clearer and more comprehensible, it is
    worth recalling a valuable admission made some time ago by the
    paper of the governing party of the S.R.s,
      Dyelo Naroda. It wrote
    that
      even in those ministries which were in the hands of socialist
    Ministers (this was written during the notorious coalition with
    the Cadets, when some Mensheviks and S.R.s were ministers), the
    entire administrative apparatus had remained unchanged, and
    hampered work.

This is quite understandable. The entire history of the
    bourgeois-parliamentary, and also, to a considerable extent, of
    the bourgeois-constitutional, countries shows that a change of
    ministers means very little, for the real work of administration
    is in the hands of an enormous army of officials. This army,
    however, is undemocratic through and through, it is connected by
    thousands and millions of threads with the landowners and the
    bourgeoisie and is completely dependent on them. This army is
    surrounded by an atmosphere of bourgeois relations, and breathes
    nothing but this atmosphere. It is set in its ways, petrified,
    stagnant, and is powerless to break free of this atmosphere. It
    can only think, feel, or act in the old way. This army is bound by
    servility to rank, by certain privileges of “Civil”

    

Service;
    the upper ranks of this army are, through the medium of shares and
    banks, entirely enslaved by finance capital, being to a certain
    extent its agent and a vehicle of its interests and influence.

It is the greatest delusion, the greatest self-deception, and a
    deception of the people, to attempt, by means of
      this state
    apparatus, to carry out such reforms as the abolition of landed
    estates without compensation, or the grain monopoly, etc. This
    apparatus
      can serve a republican bourgeoisie, creating a republic
    in the shape of a “monarchy without a monarch”, like the
    French Third Republic, but it is absolutely incapable of carrying
    out reforms which would even seriously curtail or limit the rights
    of capital, the rights of “sacred private property”, much
    less abolish those rights. That is why it always happens, under
    all sorts of “coalition” Cabinets that include
    “socialists”, that these socialists, even when individuals
    among them are perfectly honest, in reality turn out to be either
    a useless ornament of or a screen for the bourgeois government, a
    sort of lightning conductor to divert the people’s indignation
    from the government, a tool for the government to deceive the
    people. This was the case with Louis Blanc in 1848, and dozens of
    times in Britain and France, when socialists participated in
    Cabinets. This is also the case with the Chernovs and Tseretelis in
    1917. So it has been and so it will be as long as the bourgeois
    system exists and as long as the old bourgeois, bureaucratic state
    apparatus remains intact.

The Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies are
    particularly valuable because they represent a new
      type of state
    apparatus, which is immeasurably higher, incomparably more
    democratic. The S.R.s and Mensheviks have done everything, the
    possible and the impossible, to turn the Soviets (particularly the
    Petrograd Soviet and the All-Russia Soviet, i.e., the Central
    Executive Committee) into useless talking shops which, under the
    guise of “control”, merely adopted useless resolutions and
    suggestions which the government shelved with the most polite and
    kindly smile. The “fresh breeze” of the Kornilov affair,
    however, which promised a real storm, was enough for all that was
    musty in the Soviet to blow away for a while, and for the
    initiative of the revolutionary people to begin

    

expressing itself
    as something majestic, powerful and invincible.

Let all sceptics learn from this example from history. Let
    those who say: “We have no apparatus to replace the old one,
    which inevitably gravitates towards the defence of the
    bourgeoisie,” be ashamed of themselves. For this apparatus
      exists. It is the Soviets. Don’t be afraid of the people’s
    initiative and independence. Put your faith in their revolutionary
    organisations, and you will see
      in all realms of state affairs the
    same strength, majesty and invincibility of the workers and
    peasants as were displayed in their unity and their fury against
    Kornilov.

Lack of faith in the people, fear of their initiative and
    independence, trepidation before their revolutionary energy
    instead of all-round and unqualified support for it—this is
    where the S.R. and Menshevik leaders have sinned most of all. This
    is where we find one of the deepest roots of their indecision,
    their vacillation, their infinite and infinitely fruitless
    attempts to pour new wine into the old bottles of the old,
    bureaucratic state apparatus.

Take the history of the democratisation of the army in the 1917
    Russian revolution, the history of the Chernov Ministry, of
    Palchinsky’s “reign”, and of Peshekhonov’s
    resignation—you will find what we have said above strikingly
    borne out at every step. Because there was no full confidence in
    the elected, soldiers’ organisations and no absolute observance of
    the principle of soldiers electing their commanding officers, the
    Kornilovs, Kaledins and counter-revolutionary officers came to be
    at the head of the army. This is a fact. Without deliberately
    closing one’s eyes, one cannot fail to see that
      after the Kornilov
    affair Kerensky’s government is
      leaving everything as before, that
      in fact it is bringing back the Kornilov affair. The appointment
    of Alexeyev, the “peace” with the Klembovskys, Gagarins,
    Bagrations and other Kornilov men, and leniency in the treatment
    of Kornilov and Kaledin all very clearly prove that Kerensky is in
    fact bringing back the Kornilov affair.

There is no middle course. This has been shown by
    experience. Either all power goes to the Soviets and the army is
    made fully democratic, or another Kornilov affair occurs.
 

And what about the history of the Chernov Ministry? Didn’t it
    prove that every more or less serious step towards actually
    satisfying the peasants’ needs, every step showing confidence in
    the peasants and in their mass organisations and actions, evoked
    very great enthusiasm among them? Chernov, however, had to spend
    almost four months “haggling” with the Cadets and
    bureaucrats, who by endless delays and intrigues finally forced
    him to resign without having accomplished anything. For and during
    these four months the landowners and capitalists “won the
    game”—they saved the landed estates, delayed the convocation
    of the Constituent Assembly, and even started a number of
    repressions against the land committees.

There is no middle course. This has been shown by
    experience. Either all power goes to the Soviets both centrally
    and locally, and all land is given to the peasants
      immediately,
    pending the Constituent Assembly’s decision, or the landowners and
    capitalists obstruct every step, restore the landowners’ power,
    drive the peasants into a rage and carry things to an exceedingly
    violent peasant revolt.

The same thing happened when the capitalists (with the aid of
    Palchinsky) crushed every more or less serious attempt to
    supervise production, when the merchants thwarted the grain
    monopoly and broke up the regulated democratic distribution of
    grain and other foodstuffs just
      begun by Peshekhonov.

What is now necessary in Russia is not to invent
      “new
      reforms”,
      not to make “plans”
      for “comprehensive”
      changes.
      Nothing of the kind.
      This is how the situation is
    depicted—deliberately depicted in a false light—by the
    capitalists, the Potresovs, the Plekhanovs, who shout against
      “introducing socialism”
      and against the “dictatorship of
    the proletariat”. The situation in Russia in fact is such that
    the unprecedented burdens and hardships of the war, the
    unparalleled and very real danger of economic dislocation and
    famine have of themselves suggested the way out, have of
    themselves not only pointed out, but advanced reforms and other
    changes as absolutely necessary. These changes must be the grain
    monopoly, control over production and distribution, restriction of
    the issue of paper money, a fair exchange of grain for
    manufactured goods, etc.
 

Everyone recognises measures of this kind and in this direction
    as inevitable, and in many places they have already been launched
    from the most diverse sides.
      They have already been launched, but
    they have been and are being obstructed everywhere by the
    resistance of the landowners and the capitalists, which is being
    put up through the Kerensky government (an utterly bourgeois
    and Bonapartist government
      in reality), through the old
    bureaucratic state apparatus, and through the direct and indirect
    pressure of Russian and “Allied” finance capital.

Not so long ago I. Prilezhayev, lamenting the resignation of
    Peshekhonov and the collapse of the fixed prices and the grain
    monopoly, wrote in
      Dyelo Naroda (No. 147):


“Courage and resolve are what our governments of all
compositions have lacked. . . . The revolutionary democrats must
not wait; they must themselves show initiative, and intervene in
the economic chaos in a planned way. . . . If anywhere, it is here
that a firm course and a determined government are
necessary.”


That goes without saying. Words of gold. The only trouble is
    that the author forgot that the question of the firm course to
    take, of courage and resolve, is not a personal matter, but a
    question of which
      class is capable of manifesting courage and
    resolve. The only class capable of this is the proletariat. A
    courageous and resolute government ..steering a firm course is
    nothing but the dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor
    peasants. I. Prilezhayev unwittingly longs for
      this
    dictatorship.

What would such a dictatorship mean in practice? It would mean
    nothing but the fact that the resistance of the Kornilov men would
    be broken and the democratisation of the army restored and
    completed. Two days after its creation ninety-mine per cent of the
    army would be enthusiastic supporters of this dictatorship. This
    dictatorship would give land to the peasants and ‘full power to
    the local peasant committees. How can anyone in his right senses
    doubt that the peasants would support this dictatorship? What
    Peshekhonov only
      promised (“the resistance of the capitalists
    has been. broken” was what Peshekhonov actually said in his
    famous speech before the Congress of Soviets), this dictatorship
    would put into effect, would translate into reality. At the same
    time the democratic organisations of

    

food supply, control, etc.,
    that have already begun to form would in no way be
    eliminated. They would, on the contrary, be supported and
    developed, and all obstacles in the way of their work would be
    removed.

Only the dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasants
    is capable of smashing the resistance of the capitalists, of
    displaying truly supreme courage and determination in the exercise
    of power, and of securing the enthusiastic, selfless and truly
    heroic support of the masses both ‘in the army and among the
    peasants.

Power to the Soviets—this is the only way to make further
    progress gradual, peaceful and smooth, keeping perfect pace with
    the political awareness and resolve of the majority of the people
    and with their own experience. Power to the Soviets means the
    complete transfer of the country’s administration and economic
    control into the hands of the workers and peasants, to whom
      nobody
    would dare offer resistance and who, through practice, through
      their own experience, would soon learn how to distribute the land,
    products and grain properly.

      Lenin wrote The State and Revolution in August and
      September 1917, when he was in hiding from persecution of the Provisional
      Government. The need for such a theoretical work as this was
      mentioned by Lenin in the second half of 1916. It was then that
      he wrote his note on "The Youth International", in which he
      criticised Bukharin's position on the question of the state and
      promised to write a detailed article on what he thought to be
      the Marxist attitude to the state. In a letter to
      A. M. Kollontai on February 17 (N.S.), 1917, he said that he had
      almost got ready material on that question  . This material was written in a small
      blue-covered notebook headed "Marxism on the State". In it Lenin
      had collected quotations from the works of Marx and Engels, and
      extracts from the books by Kautsky, Pannekoek and Bernstein with
      his own critical notes, conclusions and generalisations.
    

      When Lenin left Switzerland for Russia in April 1917, he feared
      arrest by the Provisional Government and left the manuscript of
      "Marxism on the State" behind — as it would have been
      destroyed had he been caught. When in hiding after the July
      events, Lenin wrote in a note:
    

      "Entre nous, if I am knocked off, I ask you to publish my
      notebook 'Marxism on the State' (it got held up in
      Stockholm). It is bound in a blue cover. All the quotations from
      Marx and Engels are collected there, also those from Kautsky
      against Pannekoek. There are a number of remarks, notes and
      formulas. I think a week's work would be enough to publish it. I
      consider it important because not only Plekhanov, but Kautsky,
      too, is confused...." When Lenin received his notebook
      from Stockholm, he used the material he had collected as a basis
      for his book The State and Revolution.
    

      According to Lenin's plan, The State and Revolution was
      to have consisted of seven chapters, but he did not write the
      seventh, "The Experience of the Russian Revolutions of 1905 and
      1917", and only a detailed plan has remained. In a note to the
      publisher Lenin wrote that if he "was too slow in competing
      this, the seventh chapter, or should it turn out to be too
      bulky, the first six chapters should be published separately as
      Book One."
    

      Originally, the name F.F. Ivanovsky is shown on the first page
      of the notebook manuscript as that of the author. Lenin intended
      to publish the book under that pseudonym, otherwise the
      Provisional Government would have confiscated it for his name
      alone. The book, however, was not printed until 1918, when there
      was no longer any need for the pseudonym. The second edition
      appeared in 1919; in this revision Lenin added to Chapter II a new section "The Presentation of the Question by Marx in
      1852".

      The Bolsheviks, having obtained a majority in the Soviets of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies of both capitals, can
      and must take state power into their own hands.

      They can because the active majority of revolutionary elements
      in the two chief cities is large enough to carry the people with
      it, to overcome the opponent’s resistance, to smash him,
      and to gain and retain power. For the Bolsheviks, by immediately
      proposing a democratic peace, by immediately giving the land to
      the peasants and by reestablishing the democratic institutions
      and liberties which have been mangled and shattered by Kerensky,
      will form a government which nobody will be able to
      overthrow.

      The majority of the people are on our side.
      This was
      proved by the long and painful course of events from May 6 to
      August 31 and to September 12.[2] The majority gained in the Soviets of
      the metropolitan cities resulted from the people coming
      over to our side. The wavering of the Socialist-Revolutionaries
      and Mensheviks
      and the increase in the number of internationalists within their
      ranks prove the same thing.

The
      Democratic Conference represents not a majority of
      the revolutionary people, but only the compromising upper
      strata of the petty bourgeoisie. We must not be deceived by
      the election figures: elections prove nothing. Compare the
      elections to the city councils of Petrograd and Moscow with the
      elections to the Soviets. Compare the elections in Moscow with
      the Moscow strike of August 12. Those are objective facts
      regarding that majority of revolutionary elements that are
      leading the people.

      The Democratic Conference is deceiving the peasants; it is
      giving them neither peace nor land.

      A Bolshevik government alone will satisfy the demands of
      the peasants.
*   *   *

      Why must the Bolsheviks assume power at this very moment?

      Because the impending surrender of Petrograd will make our
      chances a hundred times less favourable.

      And it is not in our power to prevent the surrender of
      Petrograd while the army is headed by Kerensky and Co.

      Nor can we "wait" for the Constituent Assembly, for by
      surrendering Petrograd Kerensky and Co. can always
      frustrate its convocation. Our Party alone, on taking
      power, can secure the Constituent Assembly’s convocation;
      it will then accuse the other parties of procrastination and
      will be able to substantiate its accusations.

      A separate peace between the British and German imperialists
      must and can be prevented, but only by quick action.

      The people are tired of the waverings of the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries. It is only our victory in the
      metropolitan cities that will carry the peasants with us.
*   *   *

      We are concerned now not with the "day", or "moment" of
      insurrection in the narrow sense of the word. That will be only
      decided by the common voice of those who are in
      contact with the workers and soldiers, with the
      masses.

      The point is that now, at the Democratic Conference, our Party
      has virtually its own congress, and this congress
      (whether it wishes to or not) must decide the fate
      of the revolution.

      The point is to make the task clear to the Party. The
      present task must be an armed uprising in Petrograd and
      Moscow (with its region), the seizing of power and the overthrow
      of the government. We must consider how to agitate for
      this without expressly saying as much in the press.

      We must remember and weigh Marx’s words about insurrection,
      "Insurrection is an art", [6] etc.
*   *   *

      It would be naive to wait for a "formal" majority for the
      Bolsheviks. No revolution ever waits for that. Kerensky and
      Co. are not waiting either, and are preparing to surrender
      Petrograd. It is the wretched waverings of the Democratic
      Conference that are bound to exhaust the patience of the workers
      of Petrograd and Moscow! History will not forgive us if we do
      not assume power now.

      There is no apparatus? There is an apparatus—the Soviets
      and the democratic organisations. The international situation
      right now, on the eve of the conclusion of a
      separate peace between the British and the Germans, is in
      our favour. To propose peace to the nations right now means
      to win.

      By taking power both in Moscow and in Petrograd at
      once (it doesn’t matter which comes first, Moscow may
      possibly begin), we shall win absolutely and
      unquestionably.

Footnotes

[1] These
      letters were discussed by the Central Committee on September 15
      (28), 1917, which decided to call a meeting shortly to discuss
      tactics. The following question was put to the vote:
      preservation of only one copy of Lenin’s letters. The vote
      was six in favour, four against and six abstentions. Kamenev, an
      opponent of the Party’s course towards a socialist
      revolution, motioned a resolution aimed against Lenin’s
      proposals to organise an armed uprising. Kamenev’s motion
      was defeated.

      September 12: the date set by the Central Executive
      Committee of the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies and the Executive Committee of the All-Russia Soviet of
      Peasants’ Deputies, both dominated by
      socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, for the convocation of
      a Democratic Conference. The Democratic Conference took place in
      Petrograd, September 14-22. See here for more details.

      One of the most vicious and probably most widespread distortions
      of Marxism resorted to by the dominant "socialist" parties is
      the opportunist lie that preparation for insurrection, and
      generally the treatment of insurrection as an art, is "Blanquism".

    
Bernstein,
      the leader of opportunism, has already earned himself
      unfortunate fame by accusing Marxism of Blanquism, and when our
      present-day opportunists cry Blanquism they do not improve on or
      "enrich" the meagre "ideas" of Bernstein one little bit.

    
      Marxists are accused of Blanquism for treating insurrection as
      an art! Can there be a more flagrant perversion of the truth,
      when not a single Marxist will deny that it was Marx who
      expressed himself on this score in the most definite, precise
      and categorical manner, referring to insurrection specifically
      as an art, saying that it must be treated as an art,
      that you must win the first success and then proceed from
      success to success, never ceasing the offensive against
      the enemy, taking advantage of his confusion, etc., etc.?

    
      To be successful, insurrection must rely not upon conspiracy and
      not upon a party, but upon the advanced class. That is the first
      point. Insurrection must rely upon a revolutionary upsurge
      of the people. That is the second point. Insurrection must
      rely upon that turning-point in the history of the growing
      revolution when the activity of the advanced ranks of the people
      is at its height, and when the vacillations in the ranks of the
      enemy and in the ranks of the weak, half-hearted and
      irresolute friends of the revolution are strongest. That is
      the third point. And these three conditions for raising the
      question of insurrection distinguish Marxism from
      Blanquism.

      Once these conditions exist, however, to refuse to treat
      insurrection as an art is a betrayal of Marxism and a betrayal
      of the revolution.

    
      To show that it is precisely the present moment that the Party
      must recognise as the one in which the entire course of
      events has objectively placed insurrection on the order
      of the day and that insurrection must be treated as an art, it
      will perhaps be best to use the method of comparison, and to
      draw a parallel between July 3-4 and the September days.

    
      On July 3-4 it could have been argued, without violating the
      truth, that the correct thing to do was to take power, for our
      enemies would in any case have accused us of insurrection and
      ruthlessly treated us as rebels. However, to have decided on
      this account in favour of taking power at that time would have
      been wrong, because the objective conditions for the victory of
      the insurrection did not exist.

    
      (1) We still lacked the support of the class which is the
      vanguard of the revolution.

    
      We still did not have a majority among the workers and soldiers
      of Petrograd and Moscow. Now we have a majority in both
      Soviets. It was created solely by the history of July
      and August, by the experience of the "ruthless treatment" meted
      out to the Bolsheviks, and by the experience of the Kornilov
      revolt.

    
      (2) There was no country-wide revolutionary upsurge at that
      time. There is now, after the Kornilov revolt; the situation in
      the provinces and assumption of power by the Soviets in many
      localities prove this.

    
      (3) At that time there was no vacillation on any
      serious political scale among our enemies and among the
      irresolute petty bourgeoisie. Now the vacillation is
      enormous. Our main enemy, Allied and world imperialism (for
      world imperialism is headed by the "Allies"), has begun to
waver between a war to a victorious finish and a separate
      peace directed against Russia. Our petty-bourgeois democrats,
      having clearly lost their majority among the people, have begun
      to vacillate enormously, and have rejected a bloc, i.e., a
      coalition, with the
      Cadets.

      (4) Therefore, an insurrection on July 3-4 would have been a
      mistake; we could not have retained power either physically or
      politically. We could not have retained it physically even
      though Petrograd was at times in our hands, because at that time
      our workers and soldiers would not have fought and died
      for Petrograd. There was not at the time that "savageness", or
      fierce hatred both of the Kerenskys and of the
      Tseretelis and Chernovs. Our people had still not been tempered
      by the experience of the persecution of the Bolsheviks in which
      the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks participated.

    
      We could not have retained power politically on July 3-4
      because, before the Kornilov revolt, the army and the
      provinces could and would have marched against Petrograd.

    
      Now the picture is entirely different.
    
      We have the following of the majority of a class, the vanguard
      of the revolution, the vanguard of the people, which is capable
      of carrying the masses with it.
      
    
      We have the following of the majority of the people,
      because Chernov's resignation, while by no means the only
      symptom, is the most striking and obvious symptom that the
      peasants will not receive land from the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries' bloc (or from the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries themselves). And that is the chief
      reason for the popular character of the revolution.

    
      We are in the advantageous position of a party that knows for
      certain which way to go at a time when imperialism, as a
      whale and the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary bloc as
      a whole are vacillating in an incredible fashion.

    
Our victory is assured, for the people are close to
      desperation, and we are showing the entire people a sure way
      out; we demonstrated to the entire people during the "Kornilov
      days" the value of our leadership, and then proposed to the
      politicians of the bloc a compromise, which they
      rejected, although there is no let-up in their
      vacillations.

    
      It would be a great mistake to think that our offer of a
      compromise had not yet been rejected, and that the Democratic
      Conference may still accept it. The compromise was
      proposed by a party to parties; it could not have been
      proposed in any other way. It was rejected by parties. The
      Democratic Conference is a conference, and nothing
      more.

    
      One thing must not be forgotten, namely, that the majority of
      the revolutionary people, the poor, embittered peasants, are not
      represented in it. It is a conference of a minority of the
      people—this obvious truth must not be forgotten. It
      would be a big mistake, sheer parliamentary cretinism on our
      part, if we were to regard the Democratic Conference as a
      parliament; for even if it were to proclaim itself a permanent
      and sovereign parliament of the revolution, it would
      nevertheless decide nothing. The power of decision lies
      outside it in the working-class quarters of Petrograd
      and Moscow.

      All the objective conditions exist for a successful
      insurrection. We have the exceptional advantage of a situation
      in which only our victory in the insurrection can put an end to
      that most painful thing on earth, vacillation, which has worn
      the people out; in which only our victory in the insurrection
      will give the peasants land immediately; a situation in which
      only our victory in the insurrection can foil the game
      of a separate peace directed against the revolution —foil
      it by publicly proposing a fuller, juster and earlier peace, a
      peace that will benefit the revolution.

    
      Finally, our Party alone can, by a victorious insurrection, save
      Petrograd; for if our proposal for peace is rejected, if we do
      not secure even an armistice, then we shall become "defencists",
      we shall place ourselves at the head of the war
      parties, we shall be the war party par excellence,
      and we shall conduct the war in a truly revolutionary manner. We
      shall take away all the bread and boots from the capitalists. We
      shall leave them only crusts and dress them in bast shoes. We
      shall send all the bread and footwear to the front.

    
      And then we shall save Petrograd.
    
      The resources, both material and spiritual, for a truly
      revolutionary war in Russia are still immense; the chances are a
      hundred to one that the Germans will grant us at least an
      armistice. And to secure an armistice now would in itself mean
      to win the whole world.

*    *    *

      Having recognised the absolute necessity for an insurrection of
      the workers of Petrograd and Moscow in order to save the
      revolution and to save Russia from a "separate" partition by the
      imperialists of both groups, we must first adapt our political
      tactics at the Conference to the conditions of the growing
      insurrection; secondly, we must show that it is not only in
      words that we accept Marx's idea that insurrection must be
      treated as an art.

    
      At the Conference we must immediately cement the Bolshevik
      group, without striving after numbers, and without fearing to
      leave the waverers in the waverers' camp. They are more useful
      to the cause of the revolution there than in the camp
      of the resolute and devoted fighters.

    
      We must draw up a brief declaration from the Bolsheviks,
      emphasising in no uncertain manner the irrelevance of long
      speeches and of "speeches" in general, the necessity for
      immediate action to save the revolution, the absolute necessity
      for a complete break with the bourgeoisie, for the removal of
      the present government, in its entirety, for a complete rupture
      with the Anglo-French imperialists, who are preparing a
      "separate" partition of Russia, and for the immediate transfer
      of all power to revolutionary democrats, headed by the
      revolutionary proletariat.

      Our declaration must give the briefest and most trenchant
      formulation of this conclusion in connection with the programme
      proposals of peace for the peoples, land for the peasants,
      confiscation of scandalous profits, and a check on the
      scandalous sabotage of production by the capitalists.

    
      The briefer and more trenchant the declaration, the better. Only
      two other highly important points must be clearly indicated in
      it, namely, that the people are worn out by the vacillations,
      that they are fed up with the irresolution of the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks; and that we are
      definitely breaking with these parties because they
      have betrayed the revolution.

    
      And another thing. By immediately proposing a peace without
      annexations, by immediately breaking with the Allied
      imperialists and with all imperialists, either we shall at once
      obtain an armistice, or the entire revolutionary proletariat
      will rally to the defence of the country, and a really just,
      really revolutionary war will then be waged by revolutionary
      democrats under the leadership of the proletariat.



      Having read this declaration, and having appealed for
      decisions and not talk, for action and not
      resolution-writing, we must dispatch our entire group
      to the factories and the barracks. Their place is
      there, the pulse of life is there, there's the source of
      salvation for our revolution, and there is he motive force of
      the Democratic Conference.

    
      There, in ardent and impassioned speeches, we must explain our
      programme and put the alternative: either the Conference adopts
      it in its entirety, or else insurrection. There is no
      middle course. Delay is impossible. The revolution is lying.

    
      By putting the question in this way, by concentrating our entire
      group in the factories and barracks, we shall be able to
      determine the right moment to start the insurrection.

      In order to treat insurrection in a Marxist way, i.e., as an
      art, we must at the same time, without losing a single moment,
      organise a headquarters of the insurgent detachments,
      distribute our forces, move the reliable regiments to the most
      important points, surround the Alexandriusky Theatre, occupy the
      Peter and Paul Fortress,1' arrest the General Staff and the
      government, and move against the officer cadets and the Savage
      Division12 those detachments which would rather die than allow
      the enemy to approach the strategic points of the city. We must
      mobilise the armed workers and call them to fight the last
      desperate fight, occupy the telegraph and the telephone exchange
      at once, move our insurrection headquarters to the central
      telephone exchange and connect it by telephone with all the
      factories, all the regiments, all the points of armed fighting,
      etc.

    
      Of course, this is all by way of example, only to illustrate the
      fact that at the present moment it is impossible to remain loyal
      to Marxism, to remain loyal to the revolution unless
      insurrection is treated as an art.

The end of September undoubtedly marked a great
    turning-point in the history of the Russian revolution and, to all
    appearances, of the world revolution as well.
The world working-class revolution began with the action of individuals,
    whose boundless courage represented everything honest that remained of that
    decayed official "socialism" which is in reality social-chauvinism.
    Liebknecht
    in Germany, Adler in
    Austria, MacLean in
    Britain—these are the best-known names of the isolated heroes who have
    taken upon themselves the arduous role of forerunners of the world
    revolution.
The second stage in the historical preparation for this revolution was a
    widespread mass discontent, expressing itself in the split of the official
    parties, in illegal publications and in street demonstrations. The protest
    against the war became stronger, and the number of victims of government
    persecution increased. The prisons of countries famed for their observance
    of law and even for their freedom—Germany, France, Italy and
    Britain—became filled with tens and hundreds of internationalists,
    opponents of the war and advocates of a working-class revolution.
The third stage has now begun. This stage may be called the eve of
    revolution. Mass arrests of party leaders in free Italy, and particularly
    the beginning of mutinies in the German army,[2] are indisputable symptoms that a great
    turning-point is at hand, that we are on the eve of a world wide
    revolution.
Even before this there were, no doubt, individual cases of mutiny among
    the troops in Germany, but they were so small, so weak and isolated that it
    was possible to hush them up—and that was the chief way of checking
    the mass contagion of seditious action. Finally, there developed
    such a movement in the navy that it was impossible to hush it up,
    despite all the severity of the German regime of military servitude,
    severity elaborated with amazing minuteness of detail and observed with
    incredible pedantry.




Doubt is out of the question. We are on the threshold of a world
    proletarian revolution. And since of all the proletarian internationalists
    in all countries only we Russian Bolsheviks enjoy a measure of
    freedom—we have a legal party and a score or so of papers, we have the
    Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of both capitals on our side,
    and we have the support of a majority of the people in a time of
    revolution—to us the saying, "To whom much has been given, of him much
    shall be required" in all justice can and must be applied.
II
The crucial point of the revolution in Russia has undoubtedly
    arrived.
In a peasant country, and under a revolutionary, republican government
    which enjoys the support of the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
    parties that only yesterday dominated petty-bourgeois democracy, a
    peasant revolt is developing.
Incredible as this is, it is a fact.
We Bolsheviks are not surprised by this fact. We have always said that
    the government of the notorious "coalition" with the bourgeoisie is a
    government that betrays democracy and the revolution, that it is a
    government of imperialist slaughter, a government that
    protects the capitalists and landowners from the
    people.
Owing to the deception practised by the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
    the Mensheviks, there still exists in Russia, under a republic and in a
    time of revolution, a government of capitalists and landowners side by side
    with the Soviets. This is the bitter and sinister reality. Is it then
    surprising, in view of the incredible hardship inflicted on the people by
    prolonging the imperialist war and by its consequences, that a peasant
    revolt has begun and is spreading in Russia?
Is it then surprising that the enemies of the Bolsheviks, the leaders of
    the official Socialist-Revolutionary Party, the very party that
    supported the "coalition" all along, the party that until the last few days
    or weeks had the majority of the people on its side, the party that
    continues to harry and abuse the "new" Socialist-Revolutionaries, who have
    realised that the policy of coalition is a betrayal of the interests of the
    peasants—is it surprising that these leaders of the official
    Socialist-Revolutionary Party wrote the following in an editorial in their
    official organ, Dyelo Naroda of September 29:
"So far practically nothing has been done to put an end to
    the relations of bondage that still prevail in the villages of central
    Russia. . . . The bill for the regulation of land relations in the
    countryside, which was introduced in the Provisional Government long ago,
    and which has even passed through such a purgatory as the Judicial
    Conference, has got hopelessly stuck in some office. . . . Are we not right
    in asserting that our republican government is still a long way from having
    rid itself of the old habits of the tsarist administration, and that the
    dead hand of Stolypin is still making itself strongly felt in the methods
    of the revolutionary ministers?"
This is written by the official Socialist-Revolutionaries! Just think:
    the supporters of the coalition are forced to admit that in a
    peasant country, after seven months of revolution, "practically nothing has
    been done to put an end to the bondage" of the peasants, to their
    enslavement by the land owners! These Socialist-Revolutionaries are
    forced to give the name of Stolypins to their colleague,
    Kerensky, and his gang of ministers.
Could we get more eloquent testimony than this from the camp of our
    opponents, not only to the effect that the coalition has collapsed and that
    the official Socialist-Revolutionaries who tolerate Kerensky have become an
    anti-popular, anti-peasant and
    counter-revolutionary party, but also that the whole Russian
    revolution has reached a turning-point?
A peasant revolt in a peasant country against the government of the
    Socialist-Revolutionary Kerensky, the Mensheviks Nikitin and Gvozdyov, and
    other ministers who represent capital and the interests of the landowners!
    The crushing of this revolt by military measures by a republican
    government!
In the face of such facts, can one remain a conscientious champion of
    the proletariat and yet deny that a crisis has matured, that the revolution
    is passing through an extremely critical moment, that the government's
    victory over the peasant revolt would now sound the death knell of the
    revolution, would be the final triumph of the Kornilov revolt ?
III
It is obvious that if in a peasant country, after seven months of a
    democratic republic, matters could come to a peasant revolt, it irrefutably
    proves that the revolution is suffering nation-wide collapse, that it is
    experiencing a crisis of unprecedented severity, and that the forces of
    counter-revolution have gone the limit.
That is obvious. In the face of such a fact as a peasant revolt all
    other political symptoms, even were they to contradict the fact that a
    nation-wide crisis is maturing, would have no significance whatsoever.
But on the contrary, all the symptoms do indicate that a nation-wide
    crisis has matured.
Next to the agrarian question, the most important question in Russia's
    state affairs is the national question, particularly for the
    petty-bourgeois masses of the population. And at the "Democratic"
    Conference, which was fixed by Mr. Tsereteli and Co., we find that the
    "national" curia takes second place for radicalism, yielding only to the
    trade unions, and exceeding the curia of the Soviets of Workers'
    and Soldiers' Deputies in the percentage of votes cast against the
    coalition (40 out of 55). The Kerensky government—a government
    suppressing the peasant revolt—is withdrawing the revolutionary troops
    from Finland in order to strengthen the reactionary Finnish bourgeoisie. In
    the Ukraine, the conflicts of the Ukrainians in general, and of the
    Ukrainian troops in particular, with the government are becoming more and
    more frequent.
Furthermore, let us take the army, which in war-time plays an
    exceptionally big role in all state affairs. We find that the army in
    Finland and the fleet in the Baltic have completely parted ways
    with the government. We have the testimony of the officer Dubasov, a
    non-Bolshevik, who speaks in the name of the whole front and declares in a
    manner more revolutionary than that of any Bolsheviks that the soldiers
    will not fight any longer.[3] We have governmental reports stating that the
    soldiers are in a state of "agitation" and that it is impossible to
    guarantee the maintenance of "order" (i.e., participation of these troops
    in the suppression of the peasant revolt). We have, finally, the voting in
    Moscow, where fourteen thousand out of seventeen thousand soldiers voted
    for the Bolsheviks.
This vote in the elections to the district councils in Moscow is in
    general one of the most striking symptoms of the profound change which has
    taken place in the mood of the whole nation. It is generally known that
    Moscow is more petty-bourgeois than Petrograd. It is a fact frequently
    corroborated and indisputable that the Moscow proletariat has an
    incomparably greater number of connections with the countryside, that it
    has greater sympathy for the peasant and is closer to the sentiments of the
    peasant.
In Moscow the vote cast for the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the
    Mensheviks nevertheless dropped from 70 per cent in June to 18 per cent.
    There can be no doubt that the petty bourgeoisie and the people have turned
    away from the coalition. The Cadets have increased their strength from 17
    to 30 per cent, but they remain a minority, a hopeless minority, despite
    the fact that they have obviously been joined
    by the "Right" Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the "Right" Mensheviks. Russkiye
    Vedomosti states that the absolute number of votes cast
    for the Cadets fell from 67,000 to 62,000. Only the votes
    cast for the Bolsheviks increased—from 34,000 to 82,000. They received
    47 per cent of the total vote. There can be no shadow of doubt that we,
    together with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, now have a majority in
    the Soviets, in the army, and in the country.
Among the symptoms that have not only a symptomatic, but also a very
    real significance is the fact that the armies of railway and postal
    employees, who are of immense importance from the general economic,
    political and military point of view, continue to be in sharp conflict with
    the government,[4] even the Menshevik defencists are dissatisfied with
    "their" Minister, Nikitin, and the official Socialist-Revolutionaries call
    Kerensky and Co. "Stolypins". Is it not clear that if such "support" of the
    government by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries has any value at
    all it can be only a negative value?
IV
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
V
Yes, the leaders of the Central Executive Committee are pursuing the
    correct tactics of defending the bourgeoisie and the landowners. And there
    is not the slightest doubt that if the Bolsheviks allowed themselves to be
    caught in the trap of constitutional illusions, "faith" in the Congress of
    Soviets and in the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, "waiting" for
    the Congress of Soviets, and so forth—these Bolsheviks would most
    certainly be miserable traitors to the proletarian cause.
They would be traitors to the cause, for by their conduct they would be
    betraying the German revolutionary workers who have started a revolt in the
    navy. To "wait" for the Congress of Soviets and so forth under such
    circumstances would be a betrayal of internationalism, a betrayal
    of the cause of the world socialist revolution.
For internationalism consists of deeds and not phrases, not
    expressions of solidarity, not resolutions.
The Bolsheviks would be traitors to the peasants, for to
    tolerate the suppression of the peasant revolt by a government which
    even Dyelo Naroda compares with the Stolypin government would be
    to ruin the whole revolution, to ruin it for good. An outcry is
    raised about anarchy and about the increasing indifference of the people,
    but what else can the people be but indifferent to the elections, when the
    peasants have been driven to revolt while the so-called
    "revolutionary democrats" are patiently tolerating its suppression by
    military force!
The Bolsheviks would be traitors to democracy and to freedom, for to
    tolerate the suppression of the peasant revolt at such a moment would
    mean allowing the elections to the Constituent Assembly to be
    fixed in exactly the same way as the Democratic Conference and the
    "Pre-parliament" were fixed, only even worse and more crudely.
The crisis has matured. The whole future of the Russian revolution is at
    stake. The honour of the Bolshevik Party is in question. The whole future
    of the international workers' revolution for socialism is at stake.
The crisis has matured....
September 29, 1917.

Everything to this point may be published, but what follows is to be
    distributed among the members of the Central Committee,
    the Petrograd Committee, the Moscow Committee, and
    the Soviets.
VI
What, then, is to be done? We must aussprechen was ist, "state
    the facts", admit the truth that there is a tendency, or an opinion, in our
    Central Committee and among the leaders of our Party which favours
    waiting for the Congress of Soviets, and is opposed to
    taking power immediately, is opposed to an immediate insurrection.
    That tendency, or opinion, must be overcome.[5]
Otherwise, the Bolsheviks will cover themselves with eternal
    shame and destroy themselves as a party.
For to miss such a moment and to "wait" for the Congress of Soviets
    would be utter idiocy, or sheer treachery.
It would be sheer treachery to the German workers. Surely we should not
    wait until their revolution begins. In that case even the Lieberdans would
    be in favour of "supporting" it. But it cannot begin as long as
    Kerensky, Kishkin and Co. are in power.
It would be sheer treachery to the peasants. To allow the peasant revolt
    to be suppressed when we control the Soviets of both capitals
    would be to lose, and justly lose, every ounce of the
    peasants' confidence. In the eyes of the peasants we would be putting
    ourselves on a level with the Lieberdans and other scoundrels.
To "wait" for the Congress of Soviets would be utter idiocy, for it
    would mean losing weeks at a time when weeks and even days decide
    everything. It would mean faint-heartedly renouncing
    power, for on November 1-2 it will have become impossible to take power
    (both politically and technically, since the Cossacks would be mobilised
    for the day of the insurrection so foolishly "appointed"[6]).
To "wait" for the Congress of Soviets is idiocy, for the Congress will
    give nothing, and can give nothing!
"Moral" importance? Strange indeed, to talk of the "importance" of
    resolutions and conversations with the Lieberdans when we know that the
    Soviets support the peasants and that the peasant revolt is
    being suppressed ! We would be reducing the Soviets to
    the status of wretched debating parlours. First defeat Kerensky, then call
    the Congress.
The Bolsheviks are now guaranteed the success of the
    insurrection: (1) we can[7] (if we do not "wait" for the Soviet Congress)
    launch a surprise attack from three points—from Petrograd,
    from Moscow and from the Baltic fleet; (2) we have slogans that guarantee
    us support—down with the government that is suppressing the revolt of
    the peasants against the landowners! (3) we have a majority in the
    country ; (4) the disorganisation among the Mensheviks and the
    Socialist-Revolutionaries is complete; (5) we are technically in a position
    to take power in Moscow (where the start might even be made, so as to catch
    the enemy unawares); (6) we have thousands of armed workers and
    soldiers in Petrograd who could at once seize the Winter Palace,
    the General Staff building, the telephone exchange and the large printing
    presses. Nothing will be able to drive us out, while agitational work in
    the army will be such as to make it impossible to combat
    this government of peace, of land for the peasants, and so forth.
If we were to attack at once, suddenly, from three points, Petrograd,
    Moscow and the Baltic fleet, the chances are a hundred to one that we would
    succeed with smaller sacrifices than on July 3-5, because the troops
    will not advance against a government of peace. Even though Kerensky
    already has "loyal" cavalry, etc., in Petrograd, if we were to
    attack from two sides, he would be compelled to surrender since
    we enjoy the sympathy of the army. If with such chances as we have
    at present we do not take power, then all talk of transferring the power to
    the Soviets becomes a lie.
To refrain from taking power now, to "wait", to indulge in talk in the
    Central Executive Committee, to confine ourselves to "fighting for the
    organ" (of the Soviet), "fighting for the Congress", is to doom the
    revolution to failure.
In view of the fact that the Central Committee has even left
    unanswered the persistent demands I have been making for such a policy
    ever since the beginning of the Democratic Conference, in view of the fact
    that the Central Organ is deleting from my articles all references
    to such glaring errors on the part of the Bolsheviks as the shameful
    decision to participate in the Pre-parliament, the admission of Mensheviks
    to the Presidium of the Soviet, etc., etc.—I am compelled to regard
    this as a "subtle" hint at the unwillingness of the Central Committee even
    to consider this question, a subtle hint that I should keep my mouth shut,
    and as a proposal for me to retire.
I am compelled to tender my resignation from the Central
    Committee, which I hereby do, reserving for myself freedom to campaign
    among the rank and file of the Party and at the Party
    Congress.
For it is my profound conviction that if we "wait" for the Congress of
    Soviets and let the present moment pass, we shall ruin the
    revolution.
N. Lenin
September 29.
P.S. There are a number of facts which serve to prove that even the
    Cossack troops will not go against a government of peace! And how many are
    there? Where are they? And will not the entire army dispatch units for
    our support?

Footnotes
[1] Written in Vyborg. It consisted of six chapters,
    the last not being intended for publication but for circulation among
    members of the Central Committee, the Petrograd and Moscow Committees and
    the Soviets. Only the manuscript of the last two chapters has come down to
    us. The article was first published in four chapters in Rabochy
    Put No. 30 of October 20 (7), 1917; a comparison of the newspaper text
    and the manuscript shows that one of the chapters was omitted and Chapter V
    was headed as Chapter IV. The article was widely carried by Bolshevik
    periodicals.
[2] The reference is to the revolutionary action by
    German sailors in August 1917, who were led by a revolutionary sailors'
    organisation numbering 4,000 members (late July 1917). It was led by sea
    men Max Reichpietsch and Albin Köbis of the Friedrich der
    Grosse. The organisation decided to fight for a democratic peace and
    prepare for an uprising. Manifestations broke out in the navy in early
    August. Sailors of the warship Prinzeregent Luitpold, which was at
    Wilhelmshaven, took absence without leave to fight for the release of their
    comrades who had earlier been arrested for staging a strike; on August 16,
    the firemen of the Westphalia refused to work; at the same time
    the crew of the cruiser Nürnberg, which was out at sea,
    staged an uprising. The sailors' movement spread to the ships of several
    squadrons at Wilhelmshaven . These manifestations were put down with great
    savagery. Reichpietsch and Köbis were shot and other active
    participants were sentenced to long terms of hard labour.
[3] The reference is to what an officer, Dubasov, said
    at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet on September 21 (October 4), 1917. He
    had just returned from the front and declared: "Whatever you may say over
    here, the soldiers will not fight".  [p. 80]
[4] The reference is to the nation-wide strike of
    railwaymen for higher wages. It started on the night of September 23
    (October 6), 1917, and threw the Provisional Government into a panic. The
    bourgeois press attacked the striking railwaymen.
    The strike was discussed by the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) on
    September 24 (October 7), 1917. In an appeal, "Let's Help the Railwaymen",
    which was published in Rabochy Put (The Workers' Path ),
    the Central Committee exposed the counter-revolutionary policy of the
    Provisional Government and called on the proletariat to express full
    sympathy for the railwaymen, protect them from the provocative attacks of
    the counter-revolutionaries and do everything to prevent their strike from
    being isolated and defeated. The strike ended on the night of September 26
    (October 9), 1917, when the Provisional Government satisfied some of the
    railwaymen's demands.
[5] The reference is to the attitude of Kamenev,
    Zinoviev, and Stalin and their followers. Kamenev and Zinoviev opposed
    Lenin's plan for an armed uprising, declaring that the working class of
    Russia was incapable of carrying out a socialist revolution. They slid down
    to the Menshevik position of demanding a bourgeois republic.
[6] To "convene" the Congress of Soviets for October 20
    in order to decide upon "taking power"—how does that differ from
    foolishly "appointing" an insurrection? It is possible to take power now,
    whereas on October 20-29 you will not be given a chance to.
[7] What has the Party done to study the
    disposition of the troops, etc? What has it done to conduct the
    insurrection as an art? Mere talk in the Central Executive Committee, and
    so on!

      Foreword To The Second Edition 
    

      The present pamphlet, as is evident from the text, was written
      at the end of September and was finished on October 1, 1917. 
    

      The October 25 Revolution has transferred the question raised in
      this pamphlet from the sphere of theory to the sphere of
      practice. 
    

      This question must now be answered by deeds, not words. The
      theoretical arguments advanced against the Bolsheviks taking
      power were feeble in the extreme. These arguments have been shot
      to pieces. 
    

      The task now is for the advanced class—the
      proletariat—
      to prove in practice the viability of the workers' and peasants'
      government. All class-conscious workers, all the active and
      honest peasants, all working and exploited people, will do
      everything they can to solve the immense historic question in
      practice. 
    

      To work, everybody to work, the cause of the world socialist
      revolution must and will triumph. 
    

      St. Petersburg, November 9, 1917.

[This forward was written in the pamphlet by
N. Lenin, Can the Bolsheviks Retain state Power?,
"Soldiers' and Peasants' Library" Series,
St. Petersburg. Published according to the text in the
pamphlet.]



On what are all trends
      agreed, from Rech to
      Novaya
  Zhizn inclusively, from the Kornilovite Cadets to the
      semi-Bolsheviks, all, except the Bolsheviks? 
    

      They all agree that the Bolsheviks will either never dare take
      over full state power alone, or, if they do dare, and do take
      power, they will not be able to retain it even for the shortest
      while. 
    

      If anybody asserts that the question of the Bolsheviks alone
      taking over full state power is a totally unfeasible political
      question, that only a swelled-headed "fanatic" of the worst kind
      can regard it as feasible, we refute this assertion by quoting
      the exact statements of the most responsible and most
      influential political parties and trends of various "hues". 
    

      But let me begin with a word or two about the first of the
      questions mentioned—will the Bolsheviks dare take over full
      state power alone? I have already had occasion, at the
      All-Russia Congress of Soviets, to answer this question in the
      affirmative in no uncertain manner by a remark that I shouted
      from my seat during one of Tsereteli's [2] 

      ministerial
      speeches. And I have not met in the press, or heard, any
      statements by Bolsheviks to the effect that we ought not to take
      power alone. I still maintain that a political party—and
      the party of the advanced class in particular—would have no
      right to exist, would be unworthy of the name of party, would be
      a nonentity in any sense, if it refused to take power when
      opportunity offers. 
    

      We shall now quote statements by the Cadets,
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and semi-Bolsheviks (I would prefer to
      say quarter-Bolsheviks) on the question that interests us. 
    

      The leading article in Rech of September 16: 
    

      "Discord and confusion reigned in the Alexandrinsky Theatre, and
      the socialist press reflects the same picture. Only the views of
      the Bolsheviks are definite and straightforward At the
      Conference, they are the views of the minority. In the Soviets,
      they represent a constantly growing trend. But In spite of all
      their verbal pugnacity, their boastful phrases and display of
      self-confidence, the Bolsheviks, except for a few fanatics, are
      brave only in words. They would not attempt to take 'full power'
      on their own accord. Disorganisers and disrupters par
      excellence, they are really cowards who in their heart of
      hearts are fully aware of both their own intrinsic ignorance and
      the ephemeral nature of their present successes. They know as
      well as we all do that the first day of their ultimate triumph
      would also be the first day of their precipitous
      fall. Irresponsible by their very nature, anarchists in method
      and practice, they should be regarded only as a trend of
      political thought, or rather, as one of its aberrations. The
      best way to get rid of Bolshevism for many a year, to banish it,
      would be to place the country's fate in the hands of its
      leaders. And if it were not for the awareness that experiments
      of this kind are impermissible and fatal, one might in
      desperation decide on even this heroic measure. Happily, we
      repeat, these dismal heroes of the day are not by any means
      actually out to seize full power. Not under any circumstances
      are they capable of constructive work. Thus, all their definite
      and straight-forward views are confined to the political
      rostrum, to soap-box oratory. For practical purposes their
      position cannot be taken into consideration from any point of
      view. In one respect, however, it has some practical
      consequence: it unites all other shades of 'socialist thought'
      opposed to it. . . ." 
    

      This is the way the Cadets reason. Here, however, is the view of
      the biggest, "ruling and governing", party in Russia, the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, also expressed in an unsigned, i.e.,
      editorial, leading article in their official organ Dyelo
      Naroda of September 21: 
    

      ..."If the bourgeoisie refuse, pending the convocation of the
      Constituent Assembly, to work with the democracy on the basis of
      the platform that was endorsed by the Conference, then the
      coalition must arise from within the Conference
      itself. This would be a serious sacrifice on the part of
      the supporters of the coalition, but even those campaigning
      for the idea of a 'pure line' of power will have to agree to
      it. We are afraid, however, that agreement may not be
      reached here. In that case a third and final combination
      remains, namely: the government must be organised by that half
      of the Conference which on principle advocated the idea of a
      homogeneous government.
    

      "Let us put it definitely: the
      Bolsheviks will be obliged to form a Cabinet. With the
      greatest energy, they imbued the revolutionary democrats with
      hatred of the coalition, promising them all sorts of benefits as
      soon as 'compromise' was abandoned, and attributing to the
      latter all the country's misfortunes. 
    

      "If they were aware of what they were doing by their agitation,
      if they were not deceiving the people, it is their duty
      to redeem the promissory notes they have been handing out right
      and left.
    

      "The question is clear.
    

      "Let them not make futile
      attempts to hide behind hastily concocted theory that it is
      impossible for them to take power.
    

      "The democracy will not
      accept these theories.
    

      "At the same time, the advocates of
      coalition must guarantee them full support. These are the three
      combinations, the three ways, open to us—there are no
      others!" (The italics are those of Dyelo Naroda.) 
    

      This is the way the Socialist-Revolutionaries reason. And here,
      finally, is the "position" (if attempts to sit between two
      stools can be called a position) of the Novaya Zhizn
      "quarter-Bolsheviks", taken from the editorial in Novaya
      Zhizn of September 23. 
    

      "If a coalition with Konovalov and Kishkin is formed again, it
      will mean nothing but a new capitulation by the democracy and
      the abrogation of the Conference resolution on the formation of
      a responsible government on the platform of August 14. . . .
    

      "A
      homogeneous ministry of Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries
      will be able to feel its responsibility as little as the
      responsible socialist ministers felt it in the coalition
      cabinet. . . . This government would not only be incapable of
      rallying the 'live forces' of the revolution around itself, but
      would not even be able to count on any active support from its
      vanguard—the proletariat.
    

      "But the formation of another
      type of homogeneous cabinet, a government of the 'proletariat
      and poor peasants', would be, not a better, but an even worse
      way out of the situation, in fact it would not be a way out at
      all, but sheer bankruptcy. True, nobody is advancing such a
      slogan except in casual, timid and later systematically
      'explained away' comments in Rabochy Put." 
    

      (This glaring untruth is "boldly" written by responsible
      journalists who have forgotten even the Dyelo Naroda
      editorial of September 21.) 
    

      "Formally, the Bolsheviks have now revived the slogan 'All Power
      to the Soviets'. It was withdrawn after the July days, when the
      Soviets, represented by the Central Executive Committee,
      definitely adopted an active anti-Bolshevik policy. Now,
      however, not only can the 'Soviet line' be regarded as
      straightened out, but there is every ground to assume that at
      the proposed Congress of Soviets the Bolsheviks will have a
      majority. Under such circumstances the slogan 'All Power to the
      Soviets', resurrected by the Bolsheviks, is a 'tactical line'
      for achieving precisely the dictatorship of the proletariat and
      the 'poor peasants' True, the Soviets also imply the Soviets of
      Peasants' Deputies; the Bolshevik slogan therefore implies a
      power resting on the overwhelmingly greater part of the entire
      democracy of Russia. In that case, however, the slogan 'All
      Power to the Soviets' loses all independent significance, for it
      makes the Soviets almost identical in composition to the
      Pre-parliament set up by the Conference. . . ." 
    

      (Novaya Zhizn's assertion is a brazen lie, equivalent
      to declaring that spurious and fraudulent democracy is "almost
      identical" to democracy: the Pre-parliament is a sham
      which passes off the will of the minority of the people,
      particularly of Kuskova, Berkenheim, Chaikovsky and Co., as the
      will of the majority. This is the first point. The second point
      is that at the Conference even the Peasants' Soviets that had
      been packed by the Avksentyevs and Chaikovskys gave such a high
      percentage opposed to the coalition that taken together with the
      Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, they would have
      brought about the absolute collapse of the
      coalition. And the third point is that "Power to the
      Soviets" means that the power of the Peasants' Soviets would
      embrace mainly the rural districts, and in the rural districts
      the predominance of the poor peasants is assured.) 
    

      "If it is one and the same thing, then the Bolshevik slogan
      should be immediately withdrawn. If, however, 'Power to the
      Soviets' is only a disguise for the dictatorship of the
      proletariat, then such a power would mean precisely the failure
      and collapse of the revolution.
    

      "Does it need proof that the
      proletariat, isolated not only from the other classes in the
      country, but also from the real live forces of the democracy,
      will not be able either technically to lay hold of the state
      apparatus and set it in motion in an exceptionally complicated
      situation, or politically to resist all the pressure by hostile
      forces that will sweep away not only the proletarian
      dictatorship, but the entire revolution into the bargain?
    

      "The
      only power that will answer the requirements of the present
      situation is a really honest coalition within the democracy." 
    
* * * 

      We apologise to the reader for quoting these lengthy extracts,
      but they are absolutely necessary. It is necessary to present a
      precise picture of the positions taken by the different parties
      hostile to the Bolsheviks. It is necessary to prove in a
      definite manner the extremely important fact-that all
      these parties have admitted that the question of the Bolsheviks
      taking full state power alone is not only feasible, but also
      urgent. 
    

      Let us now proceed to examine the arguments which convince
      "everybody", from the Cadets to the Novaya Zhizn
      people, that the Bolsheviks will not be able to retain power. 
    

      The respectable Rech advances no arguments
      whatsoever. It merely pours out upon the Bolsheviks a flood of
      the choicest and most irate abuse. The extract we quoted shows,
      among other things, how utterly wrong it would be to say, "Watch
      out, comrades, for what the enemy advises must certainly be
      bad", thinking that Rech is "provoking" the Bolsheviks
      to take power. If, instead of weighing up the general and
      concrete considerations in a practical way, we allow ourselves
      to be "persuaded" by the plea that the bourgeoisie are
      "provoking" us to take power, we shall be fooled by the
      bourgeoisie, for the latter will of course always maliciously
      prophesy millions of disasters that will result from the
      Bolsheviks taking power and will always maliciously shout, "It
      would be better to get rid of the Bolsheviks at one blow and
      'for many a year' by allowing them to take power and then
      crushing them." These cries are also "provocation", if you will,
      but from a different angle. The Cadets and the bourgeoisie do
      not by any means "advise", and have never "advised", us to take
      power; they are only trying to frighten us with the
      allegedly insoluble problems of government. 
    

      No. We must not allow ourselves to be frightened by the screams
      of the frightened bourgeoisie. We must bear firmly in mind that
      we have never set ourselves "insoluble" social problems, and as
      for the perfectly soluble problem of taking immediate
      steps towards socialism, which is the only way out of the
      exceedingly difficult situation, that will be solved
      only by the dictatorship of the proletariat and poor
      peasants. Victory, and lasting victory, is now more than ever,
      more than anywhere else, assured for the proletariat in Russia
      if it takes power. 
    

      We shall in a purely practical manner discuss the
      concrete circumstances that make a certain moment
      unfavourable; but we shall not for a moment allow ourselves to
      be scared by the savage howls of the bourgeoisie; and we shall
      not forget that the question of the Bolsheviks taking full power
      is becoming really urgent. Our Party will now be
      threatened with an immeasurably greater danger if we forget this
      than if we were to admit that taking power is "premature". In
      this respect, there can be nothing "premature" now:
      there is every chance in a million, except one or two perhaps,
      in favour of this.
    

      Concerning the irate abuse poured out by
      Rech, we can and must, say:
    


In savage cries of irritation

We hear the voice of approbation,

Not in dulcet sounds of
praise.[3]



      That the bourgeoisie hate us so passionately is one of the most
      striking proofs that we are showing the people the
      right ways and means of overthrowing the rule of the
      bourgeoisie. 
    
*  *  *

      This time, by way of rare exception, Dyelo Naroda did
      not deign to honour us with its abuse nor did it advance a ghost
      of an argument. It merely tried, by indirect hints, to
      frighten us with the prospect that "the Bolsheviks will
      be obliged to form a cabinet". I can quite believe that while
      trying to frighten us, the Socialist-Revolutionaries are
      themselves sincerely seared to death by the phantom of the
      frightened liberal. I can equally believe that the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries do succeed in certain exceptionally
      high and exceptionally rotten institutions, such as the Central
      Executive Committee and similar "contact" (i.e., contact with
      the Cadets, in plain language, hobnobbing with the Cadets)
      commissions, in scaring some Bolsheviks because, first, the
      atmosphere in all those Central Executives, pre-parliaments,
      etc., is abominable, putrid to the point of nausea, and harmful
      for any man to breathe for any length of time; and
      secondly, sincerity is contagious, and a sincerely frightened
      philistine is capable of converting even an individual
      revolutionary into a philistine for a time. 
    

      But however much we may, "humanly" speaking, understand the
      sincere fright of a Socialist-Revolutionary who has had the
      misfortune to be a minister in the company of the Cadets, or who
      is eligible as a minister in the eyes of the Cadets, we would be
      committing a political error that might only too easily border
      on treachery to the proletariat if we allowed ourselves to be
      scared. Let us have your practical arguments, gentlemen!
      Cherish no hope that we shall allow ourselves to be scared by
      your fright! 
    
*  *  *

      This time we find practical arguments only in Novaya
      Zhizn. On this occasion the paper comes out in the role of
      counsel for the bourgeoisie, a role that suits it far better
      than that of counsel for the defence of the Bolsheviks, which so
      obviously "shocks" this lady with many good points.[4]


      The counsel has advanced six pleas: 
    

      (1) the proletariat is "isolated from the other classes in the
         country"; 
    

      (2) it is "isolated from the real live forces of the democracy"; 
    

      (3) it "will not be able technically to lay hold of the state
         apparatus"; 
    

      (4) it "will not be able to set this apparatus in motion"; 
    

      (5) "the situation is exceptionally complicated"; 
    

      (6) it "will be incapable of resisting all the pressure by
         hostile forces that will sweep away not only the proletarian
         dictatorship, but the entire revolution into the bargain". 
    

Novaya Zhizn formulates the first plea in a
      ridiculously clumsy fashion, for in capitalist and
      semi-capitalist society we know of only three classes: the
      bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie (which consists mainly of the
      peasantry), and the proletariat. What sense is there in talking
      about the proletariat being isolated from the other classes when
      the point at issue is the proletariat's struggle against the
      bourgeoisie, revolution against the bourgeoisie? 
    

      Evidently, Novaya Zhizn wanted to say that the
      proletariat is isolated from the peasants, for it could not
      possibly have meant the landowners. It could not, however, say
      clearly and definitely that the proletariat is now isolated
      from the peasants, for the utter incorrectness of this assertion
      would be too obvious. 
    

      It is difficult to imagine that in a capitalist country the
      proletariat should be so little isolated from the petty
      bourgeoisie—and, mark you, in a revolution against the
      bourgeoisie—as the proletariat now is in Russia. The
      latest returns of the voting by "curias" for and
      against coalition with the bourgeoisie in Tsereteli's
      "Bulygin Duma", i.e., in the notorious "Democratic" Conference,
      constitute one of the objective and incontrovertible proofs of
      this. If we take the Soviets' curias we get: 






For coalition

Against


Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies
      . . .  . . . . . . . .Soviets  of Peasant Deputies
      . . . . .  .

83102

19270






All Soviets. . . .  .

185


      262

      So, the majority as a whole is on the side of the proletarian
      slogan: against coalition with the bourgeoisie. We have
      seen above that even the Cadets are obliged to admit the growth
      of Bolshevik influence in the Soviets. And here we have the
      Conference convened by yesterday's leaders in the
      Soviets, Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, who have an
      assured majority in the central institutions! Obviously, the
      actual degree to which the Bolsheviks predominate in
      the Soviets is here understated. 
    

      Both on the question of coalition with the bourgeoisie and on
      the question of immediately transferring the landed estates to
      peasant committees, the Bolsheviks already have a majority in
      the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, a
      majority of the people, a majority of the petty
      bourgeoisie. Rabochy Put No. 19, of September 24 quotes
      from No. 25 of the organ of the Socialist-Revolutionaries
      Znamya Truda[5]

      a report on a conference of local
      Soviets of Peasants' Deputies held in Petrograd on September
      18. At this conference the Executive Committees of four
      Peasants' Soviets (Kostroma, Moscow, Samara and Taurida
      gubernias) voted for an unrestricted coalition. The Executive
      Committees of three gubernias and two armies
      (Vladimir, Ryazan and the Black Sea gubernias) voted in favour
      of a coalition without the Cadets. The Executive Committees of
      twenty-three gubernias and four armies voted against a
      coalition. 
    

So, the majority of the peasants are against a
      coalition!


      So much for the "isolation of the proletariat". 
    

      We should note, by the way, that the supporters of a coalition
      were three outlying gubernias, Samara, Taurida and the Black
      Sea, where there is a relatively very large number of rich
      peasants and big landowners who employ hired labour, and also
      four industrial gubernias (Vladimir, Ryazan, Kostroma and
      Moscow) in which the peasant bourgeoisie are also stronger than
      in the majority of the gubernias in Russia. It would be
      interesting to collect more detailed figures on this question
      and to ascertain whether information is available concerning the
      poor peasants in the gubernias where there are larger
      numbers of "rich" peasants.
    

      It is interesting,
      moreover, that the "non-Russian groups" revealed a considerable
      predominance of opponents of a coalition, namely, 40 votes
      against 15. The policy of annexation and open violence pursued
      by the Bonapartist Kerensky and Co. towards the non-sovereign
      nations of Russia has borne fruit. Wide sections of the people
      of the oppressed nations (i.e., including the mass of the petty
      bourgeoisie) trust the proletariat of Russia more than they do
      the bourgeoisie, for here history has brought to the fore the
      struggle for liberation of the oppressed nations against the
      oppressing nations. The bourgeoisie has despicably betrayed the
      cause of freedom of the oppressed nations; the proletariat is
      faithful to the cause of freedom. 
    

      At the present time the national and agrarian questions are
      fundamental questions for the petty-bourgeois sections of the
      population of Russia. This is indisputable. And on both these
      questions the proletariat is "not
      isolated"—farther from it than ever. It has the majority of
      the people behind it. It alone is capable of pursuing
      such a determined, genuinely."revolutionary-democratic" policy
      on both questions which would immediately ensure the proletarian
      state power not only the support of the majority of the
      population, but also a real outburst of revolutionary enthusiasm
      among the people. This is because, for the first time, the
      people would not see the ruthless oppression of peasants by
      landowners and of Ukrainians by Great Russians on the part of
      the government, as was the case under tsarism, nor the effort to
      continue the same policy camouflaged in pompous phrases under
      the republic, nor nagging, insult, chicanery, procrastination,
      underhand dealing and evasions (all that with which Kerensky
      rewards the peasants and the oppressed nations), but would
      receive warm sympathy proved by deeds, immediate and
      revolutionary measures against the landowners, immediate
      restitution of full freedom for Finland, the Ukraine,
      Byelorussia, for the Moslems, and so on. 
    

      The Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik gentlemen know this
      perfectly well, and are therefore dragging in the semi-Cadet
      bosses of the co-operative societies to help them pursue their
      reactionary-democratic policy against the
      people. That is why they will never dare canvass popular
      opinion, take a popular referendum, or at least a vote of all
      the local Soviets, of all the local organisations, concerning
      definite points of practical policy, for example, whether all
      the landed estates should at once be handed over to peasant
      committees, whether certain demands of the Finns or the
      Ukrainians should be conceded, etc. 
    

      Take the question of peace, the crucial issue of today. The
      proletariat "is isolated from the other classes". . . . On this
      issue the proletariat truly represents the whole
      nation, all live and honest people in all classes, the
      vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie; because only the
      proletariat, on achieving power, will immediately offer
      a just peace to all the belligerent nations, because only the
      proletariat will dare take genuinely revolutionary
      measures (publication of the secret treaties, and so forth) to
      achieve the speediest and most just peace possible. 
    

      The proletariat is not isolated. The gentlemen of Novaya
      Zhizn who are shouting about the proletariat being isolated
      are only betraying their subjective fear of the bourgeoisie. The
      objective state of affairs in Russia is undoubtedly such that
      the proletariat, precisely at the present time, is not
      "isolated" from the majority of the petty bourgeoisie. Precisely
      now, after the sad experience with the "coalition", the
      proletariat enjoys the sympathy of the majority of the
      people. This condition for the retention of power by
      the Bolsheviks does exist.
    
*  *  *

      The second plea is that the proletariat "is isolated from the
      real live forces of the democracy". What this means is
      incomprehensible. It is probably "Greek", as the French say in
      such cases. 
    

      The writers of Novaya Zhizn would make good
      ministers. They would be quite suitable as ministers in a Cadet
      cabinet because all these ministers need is the ability to spout
      plausible, polished, but utterly meaningless phrases with which
      to cover up the dirtiest work and which are therefore sure of
      winning the applause of the imperialists and
      social-imperialists. The Novaya Zhizn writers are sure
      to earn the applause of the Cadets, Breshkovskaya, Plekhanov and
      Co. for asserting that the proletariat is isolated from the real
      live forces of the democracy, because indirectly they
      imply—or will be understood to imply—that the Cadets,
      Breshkovskaya, Plekhanov, Kerensky and Co. are the "live forces
      of democracy". 
    

      This is not true. They are dead forces. The history of the
      coalition has proved this. 
    

      Overawed by the bourgeoisie and by their bourgeois intellectual
      environment, the Novaya Zhizn people regard as "live"
      the Right wing of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks
      like Volya Naroda[6], Yedinstvo, and others
      who in essentials do not differ from the Cadets. We, however,
      regard as live only those who are connected with the people and
      not with the kulaks, only those whom the lessons of the
      coalition have repelled. The "active live forces" of the
      petty-bourgeois democracy are represented by the Left wing of
      the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. That this wing has
      gained strength, particularly since the July counter-revolution,
      is one of the surest objective signs that the proletariat is
      not isolated. 
    

      This has been made even more strikingly evident by the very
      recent swing to the left of the Socialist-Revolutionary
      Centrists, as is proved by Chernov's statement on September 24
      that his group cannot support the new coalition with Kishkin and
      Co. This swing to the left of the Socialist-Revolutionary
      Centre, which up to now had constituted the overwhelming
      majority of the members of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party,
      the leading and dominant party from the point of view of the
      number of votes it obtained in the urban and particularly in the
      rural districts, proves that the statements we quoted from
      Dyelo Naroda that the democracy must, under certain
      circumstances, "guarantee full support" for a purely Bolshevik
      government are at any rate not mere empty phrases. 
    

      Facts like the refusal of the Socialist-Revolutionary Centre to
      support the new coalition with Kishkin, or the predominance of
      the opponents of the coalition among the
      Menshevik-defencists in the provinces (Jordania in the
      Caucasus, etc.), are objective proof that a certain section of
      the people which has up to now followed the Mensheviks
      and Socialist-Revolutionaries will support a purely
      Bolshevik government. 
    

      It is precisely from the live forces of the democracy
      that the proletariat of Russia is now not isolated. 
    
*  *  *

      The third plea, that the proletariat "will not be able
      technically to lay hold of the state apparatus" is, perhaps, the
      most common and most frequent. It deserves most attention for
      this reason, and also because it indicates one of the most
      serious and difficult tasks that will confront
      the victorious proletariat. There is no doubt that these tasks
      will be very difficult, but if we, who call ourselves
      socialists, indicate this difficulty only to shirk
      these tasks, in practice the distinction between us and the
      lackeys of the bourgeoisie will be reduced to nought. The
      difficulty of the tasks of the proletarian revolution should
      prompt the proletariat's supporters to make a closer and more
      definite study of the means of carrying out these tasks. 
    

      The state apparatus is primarily the standing army, the police
      and the bureaucracy. By saying that the proletariat will not he
      able technically to lay hold of this apparatus, the writers of
      Novaya Zhizn reveal their utter ignorance and their
      reluctance to take into account either facts or the arguments
      long ago cited in Bolshevik literature. 
    

      All the Novaya Zhizn writers regard themselves, if not
      as Marxists, then at least as being familiar with Marxism, as
      educated socialists. But Marx, basing himself on the experience
      of the Paris Commune, taught that the proletariat cannot simply
      lay hold of the ready-made state machine and use it for its own
      purposes, that the proletariat must smash this machine and
      substitute a new one for it (I deal with this in greater detail
      in a pamphlet, the first part of which is now finished and will
      soon appear under the title

      The State and
      Revolution. A Marxist Theory of the State and the
      Tasks of the Proletariat in the Revolution[*]). This new
      type of state machinery was created by the Paris Commune, and
      the Russian Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants'
      Deputies are a "state apparatus" of the same type. I have
      indicated this many times since April 4, 1917; it is dealt with
      in the resolutions of Bolshevik conferences and also in
      Bolshevik literature. Novaya Zhizn could, of course,
      have expressed its utter disagreement with Marx and with the
      Bolsheviks, but for a paper that has so often, and so haughtily,
      scolded the Bolsheviks for their allegedly frivolous attitude to
      difficult problems to evade this question completely is
      tantamount to issuing itself a certificate of mental poverty. 
    

      The proletariat cannot "lay hold of" the "state
      apparatus" and "set it in motion". But it can smash
      everything that is oppressive, routine, incorrigibly bourgeois
      in the old state apparatus and substitute its own, new
      apparatus. The Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants'
      Deputies. are exactly this apparatus. 
    

      That Novaya Zhizn has completely forgotten about this
      "state apparatus" can be called nothing but monstrous. Behaving
      in this way in their theoretical reasoning, the Novaya
      Zhizn people are, in essence, doing in the sphere of
      political theory what the Cadets are doing in political
      practice. Because, if the proletariat and the revolutionary
      democrats do not in fact need a new state
      apparatus, then the Soviets lose their raison
      d'être, lose their right to existence, and the
      Kornilovite Cadets are right in trying to reduce the
      Soviets to nought! 
    

      This monstrous theoretical blunder and political blindness on
      the part of Novaya Zhizn is all the more monstrous
      because even the internationalist Mensheviks (with whom
      Novaya Zhizn formed a bloc during the last City Council 
 
      * See present edition, Vol. 25.—Ed. elections in
        Petrograd) have on this question shown some proximity to the
        Bolsheviks. So, in the declaration of the Soviet majority made
        by Comrade Martov at the Democratic Conference, we read: 
    

      "The Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, set
      up in the first days of the revolution by a mighty burst of
      creative enthusiasm that stems from the people themselves,
      constitute the new fabric of the revolutionary state that has
      replaced the outworn state fabric of the old regime. . . ." 
    

      This is a little too flowery; that is to say, rhetoric here
      covers up lack of clear political thinking. The Soviets have
      not yet replaced the old "fabric", and this old
      "fabric" is not the state fabric of the old regime, but
      the state fabric of both tsarism and of the
      bourgeois republic. But at any rate, Martov here stands head and
      shoulders above Novaya Zhizn. 
    

      The Soviets are a new state apparatus which, in the first place,
      provides an armed force of workers and peasants; and this force
      is not divorced from the people, as was the old standing army,
      but is very closely bound up with the people. From the military
      point of view this force is incomparably more powerful than
      previous forces; from the revolutionary point of view, it cannot
      be replaced by anything else. Secondly, this apparatus provides
      a bond with the people, with the majority of the people, so
      intimate, so indissoluble, so easily verifiable and renewable,
      that nothing even remotely like it existed in the previous state
      apparatus. Thirdly, this apparatus, by virtue of the fact that
      its personnel is elected and subject to recall at the people's
      will without any bureaucratic formalities, is far more
      democratic than any previous apparatus. Fourthly, it provides a
      close contact with the most varied professions, thereby
      facilitating the adoption of the most varied and most radical
      reforms without red tape. Fifthly, it provides an organisational
      form for the vanguard, i.e., for the most class-conscious, most
      energetic and most progressive section of the oppressed classes,
      the workers and peasants, and so constitutes an apparatus by
      means of which the vanguard of the oppressed classes
      can elevate, train, educate, and lead the entire vast
      mass of these classes, which has up to now stood completely
      outside of political life and history. Sixthly, it makes it
      possible to combine the advantages of the 
      parliamentary system with those of immediate and direct
      democracy, i.e., to vest in the people's elected representatives
      both legislative and executive functions. Compared with
      the bourgeois parliamentary system, this is an advance in
      democracy's development which is of world-wide, historic
      significance. 
    

      In 1905, our Soviets existed only in embryo, so to speak, as
      they lived altogether only a few weeks. Clearly, under the
      conditions of that time, their comprehensive development was out
      of the question. It is still out of the question in the 1917
      Revolution, for a few months is an extremely short period
      and—this is most important—the Socialist-Revolutionary
      and Menshevik leaders have prostituted the Soviets,
      have reduced their role to that of a talking shop, of an
      accomplice in the compromising policy of the leaders. The
      Soviets have been rotting and decaying alive under the
      leadership of the Liebers, Dans, Tseretelis and Chernovs. The
      Soviets will be able to develop properly, to display their
      potentialities and capabilities to the full only by taking over
      full state power; for otherwise they have nothing
      to do, otherwise they are either simply embryos (and to
      remain an embryo too long is fatal), or playthings. "Dual power"
      means paralysis for the Soviets. 
    

      If the creative enthusiasm of the revolutionary classes had not
      given rise to the Soviets, the proletarian revolution in Russia
      would have been a hopeless cause, for the proletariat could
      certainly not retain power with the old state apparatus, and it
      is impossible to create a new apparatus immediately. The sad
      history of the prostitution of the Soviets by the Tseretelis and
      Chernovs, the history of the "coalition", is also the history of
      the liberation of the Soviets from petty-bourgeois illusions, of
      their passage through the "purgatory" of the practical
      experience of the utter abomination and filth of all
      and sundry bourgeois coalitions. Let us hope that this
      "purgatory" has steeled rather than weakened the Soviets. 
    
*  *  *

      The chief difficulty facing the proletarian revolution is the
      establishment on a country-wide scale of the most precise and
      most conscientious accounting and control, of workers'
      control of the production and distribution of goods. 
    

      When the writers of Novaya Zhizn argued that in
      advancing the slogan "workers' control" we were slipping into
      syndicalism, this argument was an example of the stupid school
      boy method of applying "Marxism" without studying it, just
      learning it by rote in the Struve manner. Syndicalism
      either repudiates the revolutionary dictatorship of the
      proletariat, or else relegates it, as it does political power in
      general, to a back seat. We, however, put it in the
      forefront. If we simply say in unison with the Novaya
      Zhizn writers: not workers' control but
      state control, it is simply a bourgeois-reformist phrase, it is,
      in essence, a purely Cadet formula, because the Cadets have no
      objection to the workers participating in "state"
      control. The Kornilovite Cadets know perfectly well that such
      participation offers the bourgeoisie the best way of fooling the
      workers, the most subtle way of politically bribing all
      the Gvozdyovs, Nikitins, Prokopoviches, Tseretelis and the rest
      of that gang. 
    

      When we say: "workers' control", always juxtaposing
      this slogan to dictatorship of the proletariat, always putting
      it immediately after the latter, we thereby explain
      what kind of state we mean. The state is the organ of
      class domination. Of which class? If of the
      bourgeoisie, then it is the Cadet-Kornilov-"Kerensky" state
      which has been "Kornilovising" and "Kerenskyising" the working
      people of Russia for more than six months. If it is of the
      proletariat, if we are speaking of a proletarian state, that
      is, of the proletarian dictatorship, then workers' control
      can become the country-wide, all-embracing,
      omnipresent, most precise and most conscientious
      accounting of the production and distribution of
      goods. 
    

      This is the chief difficulty, the chief task that faces the
      proletarian, i.e., socialist, revolution. Without the Soviets,
      this task would be impracticable, at least in Russia. The
      Soviets indicate to the proletariat the organisational
      work which can solve this historically important
      problem. 
    

      This brings us to another aspect of the question of the state
      apparatus. In addition to the chiefly "oppressive"
      apparatus—the standing army, the police and the
      bureaucracy—the modern state possesses an apparatus which
      has extremely close connections with the banks and syndicates,
      an apparatus which performs an enormous amount of accounting and
      registration work, if it may be expressed this way. This
      apparatus must not, and should not, be smashed. It must be
      wrested from the control of the capitalists; the capitalists and
      the wires they pull must be cut off, lopped
      off, chopped away from this apparatus; it must be
      subordinated to the proletarian Soviets; it must be
      expanded, made more comprehensive, and nation-wide. And this
      can be done by utilising the achievements already made
      by large-scale capitalism (in the same way as the proletarian
      revolution can, in general, reach its goal only by utilising
      these achievements). 
    

      Capitalism has created an accounting apparatus in the
      shape of the banks, syndicates, postal service, consumers'
      societies, and office employees' unions. Without big banks
      socialism would be impossible. 
    

      The big banks are the "state apparatus" which we
      need to bring about socialism, and which we take
      ready-made from capitalism; our task here is merely to lop
      off what capitalistically mutilates this excellent
      apparatus, to make it even bigger, even more
      democratic, even more comprehensive. Quantity will be
      transformed into quality. A single State Bank, the biggest of
      the big, with branches in every rural district, in every
      factory, will constitute as much as nine-tenths of the
      socialist apparatus. This will be country wide
      book-keeping, country-wide accounting of the
      production and distribution of goods, this will be, so to speak,
      some thing in the nature of the skeleton of socialist
      society. 
    

      We can "lay hold of" and "set in motion" this "state apparatus"
      (which is not fully a state apparatus under capitalism, but
      which will be so with us, under socialism) at one stroke, by a
      single decree, because the actual work of book-keeping, control,
      registering, accounting and counting is performed by
      employees, the majority of whom themselves lead a
      proletarian or semi-proletarian existence. 
    

      By a single decree of the proletarian government these employees
      can and must be transferred to the status of state employees, in
      the same way as the watchdogs of capitalism like Briand and
      other bourgeois ministers, by a single decree, transfer
      railwaymen on strike to the status of state employees. We shall
      need many more state employees of this kind, and more
      can be obtained, because capitalism has simplified the
      work of accounting and control, has reduced it to a
      comparatively simple system of book-keeping, which any
      literate person can do. 
    

      The conversion of the bank, syndicate, commercial, etc., etc.,
      rank-and-file employees into state employees is quite feasible
      both technically (thanks to the preliminary work performed for
      us by capitalism, including finance capitalism) and politically,
      provided the Soviets exercise control and supervision. 
    

      As for the higher officials, of whom there are very few, but who
      gravitate towards the capitalists, they will have to be dealt
      with in the same way as the capitalists, i.e., "severely". Like
      the capitalists, they will offer resistance. This
      resistance will have to be broken, and if the
      immortally naïve Peshekhonov, as early as June 1917, lisped
      like the infant that he was in state affairs, that "the
      resistance of the capitalists has been broken", this childish
      phrase, this childish boast, this childish 
      swagger, will be converted by the proletariat into
      reality. 
    

      We can do this, for it is merely a question of breaking the
      resistance of an insignificant minority of the population,
      literally a handful of people, over each of whom the employees'
      unions, the trade unions, the consumers' societies and the
      Soviets will institute such supervision that every Tit
      Titych will be surrounded as the French were at
      Sedan.[7] We know these Tit Tityches by name: we only have to
      consult the lists of directors, board members, large
      shareholders, etc. There are several hundred, at most several
      thousand of them in the whole of Russia, and the
      proletarian state, with the apparatus of the Soviets, of the
      employees' unions, etc., will be able to appoint ten or even a
      hundred supervisers to each of them, so that instead of
      "breaking resistance" it may even be possible, by means of
      workers' control (over the capitalists), to make all
      resistance impossible. 
    

      The important thing will not be even the confiscation of the
      capitalists' property, but country-wide, all-embracing workers'
      control over the capitalists and their possible
      supporters. Confiscation alone leads nowhere, as it does not
      contain the element of organisation, of accounting for proper
      distribution. Instead of confiscation, we could easily impose a
      fair tax (even on the Shingaryov[8] scale, for instance),
      taking care, of course, to preclude the possibility of anyone
      evading assessment, concealing the truth, evading the law. And
      this possibility can be eliminated only by the workers'
      control of the workers' state. 
    

Compulsory syndication, i.e., compulsory amalgamation
      in associations under state control—this is what capitalism
      has prepared the way for, this is what has been carried out in
      Germany by the Junkers' state, this is what can be easily
      carried out in Russia by the Soviets, by the proletarian
      dictatorship, and this is what will provide us with a state
      apparatus that will be universal, up-to-date, and
      non-bureaucratic. 
    
*  *  *

      The fourth plea of the counsels for the bourgeoisie is that the
      proletariat will not be able "to set the state apparatus in
      motion". There is nothing new in this plea compared with the
      preceding one. We could not, of course, either lay hold of or
      set in motion the old apparatus. The new apparatus, the Soviets,
      has already been set in motion by "a mighty burst of
      creative enthusiasm that stems from the people themselves". We
      only have to free it from the shackles put on it by the
      domination of the Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik
      leaders. This apparatus is already in motion; we only
      have to free it from the monstrous, petty-bourgeois impediments
      preventing it from going full speed ahead. 
    

      Two circumstances must be considered here to supplement what has
      already been said. In the first place, the new means of control
      have been created not by us, but by capitalism in its
      military-imperialist stage; and in the second place, it is
      important to introduce more democracy into the
      administration of a proletarian state. 
    

      The grain monopoly and bread rationing were introduced not by
      us, but by the capitalist state in war-time. It had 
 
      * For further details of the meaning of compulsory syndication
        see my pamphlet: The Impending
        Catastrophe and How to
        Combat It. (See present edition, Vol. 25,
        pp. 342-45.—Ed.) already introduced universal
        labour conscription within the framework of capitalism, which
        is war-time penal servitude for the workers. But here too, as
        in all its history-making activities, the proletariat takes
        its weapons from capitalism and does not "invent" or "create
        them out of nothing". 
    

      The grain monopoly, bread rationing and labour conscription in
      the hands of the proletarian state, in the hands of sovereign
      Soviets, will be the most powerful means of accounting and
      control, means which, applied to the capitalists, and to the
      rich in general, applied to them by the workers,
      will provide a force unprecedented in history for "setting the
      state apparatus in motion", for overcoming the resistance of the
      capitalists, for subordinating them to the proletarian
      state. These means of control and of compelling people to
      work will be more potent than the laws of the Convention
      and its guillotine. The guillotine only terrorised, only broke
      active resistance. For us, this is not
      enough. 
    

      For us, this is not enough. We must not only "terrorise" the
      capitalists, i.e., make them feel the omnipotence of the
      proletarian state and give up all idea of actively resisting
      it. We must also break passive resistance, which is
      undoubtedly more dangerous and harmful. We must not only break
      resistance of every kind. We must also compel the
      capitalists to work within the framework of the new state
      organisation. It is not enough to "remove" the capitalists; we
      must (after removing the undesirable and incorrigible
      "resisters") employ them in the service of the new
      state. This applies both to the capitalists and to the
      upper section of the bourgeois intellectuals, office employees,
      etc. 
    

      And we have the means to do this. The means and instruments for
      this have been placed in our hands by the capitalist state in
      the war. These means are the grain monopoly, bread rationing and
      labour conscription. "He who does not work, neither shall he
      eat"—this is the fundamental, the first and most important
      rule the Soviets of Workers' Deputies can and will introduce
      when they become the ruling power. 
    

      Every worker has a work-book. This book does not degrade him,
      although at present it is undoubtedly a document of
      capitalist wage-slavery, certifying that the workman belongs to
      some parasite. 
    

      The Soviets will introduce work-books for the rich and
      then gradually for the whole population (in a peasant country
      work-books will probably not be needed for a long time for the
      overwhelming majority of the peasants). The work-book will cease
      to be the badge of the "common herd", a document of the "lower"
      orders, a certificate of wage-slavery. It will become a document
      certifying that in the new society there are no longer any
      "workmen", nor, on the other hand, are there any longer men
      who do not work. 
    

      The rich will be obliged to get a work-book from the workers' or
      office employees' union with which their occupation is most
      closely connected, and every week, or other definite fixed
      period, they will have to get from that union a certificate to
      the effect that they are performing their work conscientiously;
      without this they will not be able to receive bread ration cards
      or provisions in general. The proletarian state will say: we
      need good organisers of banking and the amalgamation of
      enterprises (in this matter the capitalists have more
      experience, and it is easier to work with experienced people),
      and we need far, far more engineers, agronomists, technicians
      and scientifically trained specialists of every kind than were
      needed before. We shall give all these specialists work to which
      they are accustomed and which they can cope with; in all
      probability we shall introduce complete wage equality only
      gradually and shall pay these specialists higher salaries during
      the transition period. We shall place them, however, under
      comprehensive workers' control and we shall achieve the complete
      and absolute operation of the rule "He who does not work,
      neither shall he eat." We shall not invent the organisational
      form of the work, but take it ready-made from capitalism—we
      shall take over the banks, syndicates, the best factories,
      experimental stations, academies, and so forth; all that we
      shall have to do is to borrow the best models furnished by the
      advanced countries. 
    

      Of course, we shall not in the least descend to a utopia, we are
      not deserting the soil of most sober, practical reason when we
      say that the entire capitalist class will offer the most
      stubborn resistance, but this resistance will be broken by the
      organisation of the entire population in Soviets. Those
      capitalists who are exceptionally stubborn and recalcitrant
      will, of course, have to be punished by the confiscation of
      their whole property and by imprisonment. On the other hand,
      however, the victory of the proletariat will bring about an
      increase in the number of cases of the kind that I read
      about in today's Izvestia for example: 
    

      "On September 26, two engineers came to the Central Council of
      Factory Committees to report that a group of engineers had
      decided to form a union of socialist engineers. The Union
      believes that the present time is actually the beginning of the
      social revolution and places itself at the disposal of the
      working people, desiring, in defence of the workers' interests,
      to work in complete unity with the workers' organisations. The
      representatives of the Central Council of Factory Committees
      answered that the Council will gladly set up in its organisation
      an Engineers' Section which will embody in its programme the
      main theses of the First Conference of Factory Committees on
      workers' control over production. A joint meeting of delegates
      of the Central Council of Factory Committees and of the
      initiative group of socialist engineers will be held within the
      next few days." (Izvestia, September 27, 1917.) 
    
*  *  *

      The proletariat, we are told, will not be able to set the state
      apparatus in motion. 
    

      Since the 1905 revolution, Russia has been governed by 130,000
      landowners, who have perpetrated endless violence against
      150,000,000 people, heaped unconstrained abuse upon them, and
      condemned the vast majority to inhuman toil and
      semi-starvation. 
    

      Yet we are told that the 240,000 members of the Bolshevik Party
      will not be able to govern Russia, govern her in the interests
      of the poor and against the rich. These 240,000 are already
      backed by no less than a million votes of the adult population,
      for this is precisely the proportion between the number of Party
      members and the number of votes cast for the Party that has been
      established by the experience of Europe and the experience of
      Russia as shown, for example, by the elections to the Petrograd
      City Council last August. We therefore already have a "state
      apparatus" of one million people devoted to the
      socialist state for the sake of high ideals and not for the sake
      of a fat sum received on the 20th of every month. 
    

      In addition to that we have a "magic way" to enlarge our state
      apparatus tenfold at once, at one stroke, a way which
      no 
      capitalist state ever possessed or could possess. This magic way
      is to draw the working people, to draw the poor, into the daily
      work of state administration. 
    

      To explain how easy it will be to employ this magic way and how
      faultlessly it will operate, let us take the simplest and most
      striking example possible. 
    

      The state is to forcibly evict a certain family from a flat and
      move another in. This often happens in the capitalist state, and
      it will also happen in our proletarian or socialist state. 
    

      The capitalist state evicts a working-class family which has
      lost its breadwinner and cannot pay the rent. The bailiff
      appears with police, or militia, a whole squad of them. To
      effect an eviction in a working-class district a whole
      detachment of Cossacks is required. Why? Because the bailiff and
      the militiaman refuse to go without a very strong military
      guard. They know that the scene of an eviction arouses such fury
      among the neighbours, among thousands and thousands of people
      who have been driven to the verge of desperation, arouses such
      hatred towards the capitalists and the capitalist state, that
      the bailiff and the squad of militiamen run the risk of being
      torn to pieces at any minute. Large military forces are
      required, several regiments must be brought into a big city, and
      the troops must come from some distant, outlying region so that
      the soldiers will not be familiar with the life of the urban
      poor, so that the soldiers will not be "infected" with
      socialism. 
    

      The proletarian state has to forcibly move a very poor family
      into a rich man's flat. Let us suppose that our squad of
      workers' militia is fifteen strong; two sailors, two soldiers,
      two class-conscious workers (of whom, let us suppose, only one
      is a member of our Party, or a sympathiser), one intellectual,
      and eight from the poor working people, of whom at least five
      must be women, domestic servants, unskilled labourers, and so
      forth. The squad arrives at the rich man's flat, inspects it and
      finds that it consists of five rooms occupied by two men and two
      women—"You must squeeze up a bit into two rooms this
      winter, citizens, and prepare two rooms for two families now
      living in cellars. Until the time, with the aid of engineers
      (you are an engineer, aren't you?), we have built good dwellings
      for everybody, you will have to squeeze up a little. Your
      telephone will serve ten families. This will save a hundred
      hours of work wasted on shopping, and so forth. Now in your
      family there are two unemployed persons who can perform light
      work: a citizeness fifty-five years of age and a citizen
      fourteen years of age. They will be on duty for three hours a
      day supervising the proper distribution of provisions for ten
      families and keeping the necessary account of this. The student
      citizen in our squad will now write out this state order in two
      copies and you will be kind enough to give us a signed
      declaration that you will faithfully carry it out." 
    

      This, in my opinion, can illustrate how the distinction between
      the old bourgeois and the new socialist state apparatus and
      state administration could be illustrated. 
    

      We are not utopians. We know that an unskilled labourer or a
      cook cannot immediately get on with the job of state
      administration. In this we agree with the Cadets, with
      Breshkovskaya, and with Tsereteli. We differ, however, from
      these citizens in that we demand an immediate break with the
      prejudiced view that only the rich, or officials chosen from
      rich families, are capable of administering the state,
      of performing the ordinary, everyday work of administration. We
      demand that training in the work of state
      administration be conducted by class-conscious workers and
      soldiers and that this training be begun at once, i.e., that a
      beginning be made at once in training all the working
      people, all the poor, for this work. 
    

      We know that the Cadets are also willing to teach the people
      democracy. Cadet ladies are willing to deliver lectures to
      domestic servants on equal rights for women in accordance with
      the best English and French sources. And also, at the very next
      concert-meeting, before an audience of thousands, an exchange of
      kisses will be arranged on the platform: the Cadet lady lecturer
      will kiss Breshkovskaya, Breshkovskaya will kiss ex-Minister
      Tsereteli, and the grateful people will therefore receive an
      object-lesson in republican equality, liberty and
      fraternity. . . . 
    

      Yes, we agree that the Cadets, Breshkovskaya and Tsereteli are
      in their own way devoted to democracy and are propagating it
      among the people. But what is to be done if our conception of
      democracy is somewhat different from theirs? 
    

      In our opinion, to ease the incredible burdens and miseries of
      the war and also to heal the terrible wounds the war has
      inflicted on the people, revolutionary democracy is
      needed, revolutionary measures of the kind described in
      the example of the distribution of housing accommodation in the
      interests of the poor. Exactly the same procedure must
      be adopted in both town and country for the distribution of
      provisions, clothing, footwear, etc., in respect of the land in
      the rural districts, and so forth. For the administration of the
      state in this spirit we can at once set in motion a
      state apparatus consisting of ten if not twenty million
      people, an apparatus such as no capitalist state has ever
      known. We alone can create such an apparatus, for we are sure of
      the fullest and devoted sympathy of the vast majority of the
      population. We alone can create such an apparatus, because we
      have class-conscious workers disciplined by long capitalist
      "schooling" (it was not for nothing that we went to learn in the
      school of capitalism), workers who are capable of
      forming a workers' militia and of gradually expanding
      it (beginning to expand it at once) into a militia embracing
      the whole people. The class-conscious workers must lead,
      but for the work of administration they can enlist the vast mass
      of the working and oppressed people. 
    

      It goes without saying that this new apparatus is bound to make
      mistakes in taking its first steps. But did not the peasants
      make mistakes when they emerged from serfdom and began to manage
      their own affairs? Is there any way other than practice by which
      the people can learn to govern themselves and to avoid mistakes?
      Is there any way other than by proceeding immediately to genuine
      self-government by the people? The chief thing now is to abandon
      the prejudiced bourgeois-intellectualist view that only special
      officials, who by their very social position are entirely
      dependent upon capital, can administer the state. The chief
      thing is to put an end to the state of affairs in which
      bourgeois officials and "socialist" ministers are trying to
      govern in the old way, but are incapable of doing so and, after
      seven months, are faced with a peasant revolt in a peasant
      country! The chief thing is to imbue the oppressed and the
      working people with confidence in their own strength, to prove
      to them in practice that they can and must themselves ensure the
      proper, most strictly regulated and organised
      distribution of bread, all kinds of food, milk, clothing,
      housing, etc., in the interests of the poor. Unless
      this is done, Russia cannot be saved from collapse and
      ruin. The conscientious, bold, universal move to hand over
      administrative work to proletarians and semi-proletarians, will,
      however, rouse such unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm among
      the people, will so multiply the people's forces in combating
      distress, that much that seemed impossible to our narrow, old,
      bureaucratic forces will become possible for the millions, who
      will begin to work for themselves and not for the
      capitalists, the gentry, the bureaucrats, and not out of fear of
      punishment. 
    
*  *  *

      Pertinent to the question of the state apparatus is also the
      question of centralism raised with unusual vehemence and
      ineptitude by Comrade Bazarov in Novaya Zhizn No. 138,
      of September 27, in an article entitled: "The Bolsheviks and the
      Problem of Power". 
    

      Comrade Bazarov reasons as follows: "The Soviets are not an
      apparatus suitable for all spheres of state life", for, he says,
      seven months' experience has shown, and "scores and hundreds of
      documents in the possession of the Economic Department of the
      St. Petersburg Executive Committee" have confirmed, that the
      Soviets, although actually enjoying "full power" in many places,
      "have not been able to achieve anything like satisfactory
      results in combating economic ruin". What is needed is an
      apparatus "divided up according to branches of production, with
      strict centralisation within each branch, and subordinated to
      one, country-wide centre". "It is a matter", if you please, "not
      of replacing the old apparatus, but merely of reforming it
      . . . no matter how much the Bolsheviks may jeer at people with
      a plan. . . ." 
    

      All these arguments of Comrade Bazarov's are positively amazing
      for their helplessness, they echo the arguments of the
      bourgeoisie and reflect their class point of view. 
    

      In fact, to say that the Soviets have anywhere in Russia ever
      enjoyed "full power" is simply ridiculous (if it is not a
      repetition of the selfish class lie of the capitalists). Full 
      power means power over all the land, over all the banks, over
      all the factories; a man who is at all familiar with the facts
      of history and science on the connection between politics and
      economics could not have "forgotten" this "trifling"
      circumstance. 
    

      The bourgeoisie's device is to withhold power from the
      Soviets, sabotage every important step they take, while
      at the same time retaining government in their own hands,
      retaining power over the land, the banks, etc., and then
      throwing the blame for the ruin upon the Soviets! This is
      exactly what the whole sad experience of the coalition amounts
      to. 
    

      The Soviets have never had full power, and the measures they
      have taken could not result in anything but palliatives that
      added to the confusion. 
    

      The effort to prove the necessity for centralism to the
      Bolsheviks who are centralists by conviction, by their programme
      and by the entire tactics of their Party, is really like forcing
      an open door. The writers of Novaya Zhizn are wasting
      their time only because they have totally failed to understand
      the meaning and significance of our jeers at their
      "country-wide" point of view. And the Novaya Zhizn
      people have failed to understand this because they merely pay
      lip-service to the doctrine of the class struggle, but
      do not accept it seriously. Repeating the words about the class
      struggle they have learned by rote, they are constantly slipping
      into the "above-class point of view", amusing in theory and
      reactionary in practice, and are calling this fawning upon the
      bourgeoisie a "country-wide" plan. 
    

      The state, dear people, is a class concept. The state is an
      organ or instrument of violence exercised by one class against
      another. So long as it is an instrument of violence exercised by
      the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, the proletariat can
      have only one slogan: destruction of this state. But
      when the state will be a proletarian state, when it will be an
      instrument of violence exercised by the proletariat against the
      bourgeoisie, we shall be fully and unreservedly in favour of a
      strong state power and of centralism. 
    

      To put it in more popular language, we do not jeer at "plans",
      but at Bazarov and Co.'s failure to understand that by
      repudiating "workers' control", by repudiating the "dictatorship
      of the proletariat" they are for the dictatorship of
      the bourgeoisie. There is no middle course; a middle course is
      the futile dream of the petty-bourgeois democrat. 
    

      Not a single central body, not a single Bolshevik has ever
      argued against centralisation of the Soviets, against
      their amalgamation. None of us objects to having factory
      committees in each branch of production, or to their
      centralisation. Bazarov is wide of the mark. 
    

      We laugh, have laughed, and will laugh not at "centralism", and
      not at "plans", but at reformism, because, after the
      experience of the coalition, your reformism is utterly
      ridiculous. And to say "not replace the apparatus but reform it"
      means to be a reformist, means to become not a revolutionary but
      a reformist democrat. Reformism means nothing more than
      concessions on the part of the ruling class, but not
      its overthrow; it makes concessions, but power remains in
      its hands. 
    

      This is precisely what has been tried during six months of the
      coalition. 
    

      This is what we laugh at. Having failed to obtain a thorough
      grasp of the doctrine of the class struggle, Bazarov allows
      himself to be caught by the bourgeoisie who sing in chorus "Just
      so, just so, we are by no means opposed to reform, we are in
      favour of the workers participating in country-wide control, we
      fully agree with that", and good Bazarov objectively
      sings the descant for the capitalists. 
    

      This has always been and always will be the case with people who
      in the thick of intense class struggle want to take up a
      "middle" position. And it is because-the writers of Novaya
      Zhizn are incapable of understanding the class struggle
      that their policy is such a ridiculous and eternal oscillation
      between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. 
    

      Get busy on "plans", dear citizens, that is not politics, that
      is not the class struggle; here you may be of use to the
      people. You have many economists on your paper. Unite with those
      engineers and others who are willing to work on problems of
      regulating production and distribution; devote the centre page
      of your big "apparatus" (your paper) to a practical study of
      precise facts on the production and distribution of goods in
      Russia, on banks, syndicates, etc., etc.—that is how you
      will be of use to the people; that is how your sitting between
      two stools will not be particularly harmful; such work on
      "plans" will earn not the ridicule, but the gratitude of the
      workers. 
    

      When the proletariat is victorious it will do the following, it
      will set economists, engineers, agronomists, and so forth, to
      work under the control of the workers' organisations on
      drawing up a "plan", on verifying it, on devising labour-saving
      methods of centralisation, on devising the simplest, cheapest,
      most convenient and universal measures and methods of
      control. For this we shall pay the economists, statisticians and
      technicians good money . . . but we shall not give them anything
      to eat if they do not perform this work conscientiously and
      entirely in the interests of the working people. 
    

      We are in favour of centralism and of a "plan", but of the
      centralism and plan of the proletarian state, of
      proletarian regulation of production and distribution in the
      interests of the poor, the working people, the exploited,
      against the exploiters. We can agree to only one meaning of the
      term "country-wide", namely, that which breaks the resistance of
      the capitalists, which gives all power to the majority of the
      people, i.e., the proletarians and semi-proletarians, the
      workers and the poor peasants. 
    
*  *  *

      The fifth plea is that the Bolsheviks will not be able to retain
      power because "the situation is exceptionally
      complicated". . . . 
    

      O wise men! They, perhaps, would be willing to reconcile
      themselves to revolution if only the "situation" were not
      "exceptionally complicated". 
    

      Such revolutions never occur, and sighs for such a revolution
      amount to nothing more than the reactionary wails of a bourgeois
      intellectual. Even if a revolution has started in a situation
      that seemed to be not very complicated, the development of the
      revolution itself always creates an
      exceptionally complicated situation. A revolution, a
      real, profound, a "people's" revolution, to use Marx's
      expression,[9] is the incredibly complicated and painful
      process of the death of the old and birth of the new social
      order, of the mode of life of tens of millions of
      people. Revolution is a most intense, furious, desperate class
      struggle and  civil war. Not a single great revolution in
      history has taken place without civil war. And only a "man in a
      muffler"[10] can think that civil war is conceivable without an
      "exceptionally complicated situation". 
    

      If the situation were not exceptionally complicated there would
      be no revolution. If you are afraid of wolves don't go into the
      forest. 
    

      There is nothing to discuss in the fifth plea, because there is
      no economic, political, or any other meaning what ever in it. It
      contains only the yearning of people who are distressed and
      frightened by the revolution. To characterise this yearning I
      shall take the liberty of mentioning two little things from my
      personal experience. 
    

      I had a conversation with a wealthy engineer shortly before the
      July days. This engineer had once been a revolutionary, had been
      in the Social-Democratic movement and even a member of the
      Bolshevik Party. Now he was full of fear and rage at the
      turbulent and indomitable workers. "If they 
      were at least like the German workers," he said (he is an
      educated man and has been abroad), "of course, I understand that
      the social revolution is, in general, inevitable, but here, when
      the workers' level has been so reduced by the war . . . it is
      not a revolution, it is an abyss." 
    

      He was willing to accept the social revolution if history were
      to lead to it in the peaceful, calm, smooth and precise manner
      of a German express train pulling into a station. A sedate
      conductor would open the carriage door and announce: "Social
      Revolution Station! Alle aussteigen! (All change!)" In
      that case he would have no objection to changing his position of
      engineer under the Tit Tityches to that of engineer under the
      workers' organisations. 
    

      That man has seen strikes. He knows what a storm of passion the
      most ordinary strike arouses even in the most peaceful
      times. He, of course, understands how many million times more
      furious this storm must be when the class struggle has aroused
      all the working people of a vast country, when war and
      exploitation have driven almost to desperation millions of
      people who for centuries have been tormented by the landowners,
      for decades have been robbed and downtrodden by the capitalists
      and the tsar's officials. He understands all this
      "theoretically", he only pays lip-service to this, he
      is simply terrified by the "exceptionally complicated
      situation". 
    

      After the July days, thanks to the extremely solicitous
      attention with which the Kerensky government honoured me, I was
      obliged to go underground. Of course, it was the workers who
      sheltered people like us. In a small working-class house in a
      remote working-class suburb of Petrograd, dinner is being
      served. The hostess puts bread on the table. The host says:
      "Look what fine bread. 'They' dare not give us bad bread
      now. And we had almost given up even thinking that we'd ever get
      good bread in Petrograd again." 
    

      I was amazed at this class appraisal of the July days. My
      thoughts had been revolving around the political significance of
      those events, weighing the role they played in the general
      course of events, analysing the situation that caused this
      zigzag in history and the situation it would create, and how we
      ought to change our slogans and alter our Party apparatus to
      adapt it to the changed situation. As for bread, I, who had not
      known want, did not give it a thought. I took bread for granted,
      as a by-product of the writer's work, as it were. The mind
      approaches the foundation of everything, the class struggle for
      bread, through political analysis that follows an extremely
      complicated and devious path. 
    

      This member of the oppressed class, however, even though one of
      the well-paid and quite intelligent workers, takes the bull by
      the horns with that astonishing simplicity and
      straightforwardness, with that firm determination and amazing
      clarity of outlook from which we intellectuals are as remote as
      the stars in the sky. The whole world is divided into two camps:
      "us", the working people, and "them", the exploiters. Not a
      shadow of embarrassment over what had taken place; it was just
      one of the battles in the long struggle between labour and
      capital. When you fell trees, chips fly. 
    

      "What a painful thing is this 'exceptionally complicated
      situation' created by the revolution," that's how the bourgeois
      intellectual thinks and feels. 
    

      "We squeezed 'them' a bit; 'they' won't dare to lord it over us
      as they did before. We'll squeeze again—and chuck them out
      altogether," that's how the worker thinks and feels. 
*  *  *

      The sixth and last plea: the proletariat "will be incapable of
      resisting all the pressure by hostile forces that will sweep
      away not only the proletarian dictatorship, but the entire
      revolution into the bargain". 
    

      Don't try to scare us, gentlemen, you won't succeed. We saw
      these hostile forces and their pressure in Kornilovism (from
      which the Kerensky regime in no way differs). Everybody saw, and
      the people remember, how the proletariat and the poor peasants
      swept away the Kornilov gang, and how pitiful and helpless
      proved to be the position of the supporters of the bourgeoisie
      and of the few exception ally well-to-do local small landowners
      who were exceptionally "hostile" to the revolution. Dyelo
      Naroda of September 30 urges the workers to "be patient and
      put up with" Kerensky (i.e., Kornilov) and the fake Tsereteli
      Bulygin Duma until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly
      (convened under the protection of "military measures" against
      insurgent peasants!) and, with great gusto, it repeats precisely
      Novaya Zhizn's sixth plea and shouts until it is
      hoarse: "The Kerensky government will under no circumstances
      submit" (to the rule of the Soviets, the rule of the workers and
      peasants, which Dyelo Naroda, not wishing to lag behind
      the pogrom-mongers and anti-Semites, monarchists and Cadets,
      calls the rule of "Trotsky and Lenin": these are the lengths to
      which the Socialist-Revolutionaries go!). 
    

      But neither Novaya Zhizn nor Dyelo Naroda can
      scare the class-conscious workers. "The Kerensky government,"
      you say, "will under no circumstances submit", i.e., it will
      repeat the Kornilov revolt, to put it more simply, bluntly and
      clearly. And the gentlemen of Dyelo Naroda dare to say
      that this will be "civil war", that this is a "horrible
      prospect"! 
    

      No, gentlemen, you will not fool the workers. It will not be
      civil war but a hopeless revolt of a handful of Kornilovites. If
      they want to "refuse to submit" to the people and at all costs
      provoke a repetition on a wide scale of what happened to the
      Kornilov men in Vyborg—if that is what the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries want, if that is what the 
      member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party Kerensky wants, he
      may drive the people to desperation. But you will not scare the
      workers and soldiers with this, gentlemen. 
    

      What boundless insolence. They faked up a new Bulygin Duma; by
      means of fraud they recruited a crowd of reactionary
      co-operators and village kulaks to help them, added to these the
      capitalists and landowners (the so-called property owning
      classes) and with the aid of this gang of Kornilovites they want
      to thwart the will of the people, the will of the
      workers and peasants. 
    

      They have brought affairs in a peasant country to such a pass
      that peasant revolt is spreading everywhere like a river in
      flood! Think of it! In a democratic republic in which 80 per
      cent of the population are peasants, the peasants have been
      driven to revolt. . . . This same Dyelo Naroda,
      Chernov's newspaper, the organ of the "Socialist-Revolutionary"
      Party, which on September 30 has the effrontery to advise the
      workers and peasants to "be patient", was obliged to admit in a
      leading article on September 29: 
    

      "So far practically nothing has been done to put an end
      to those relations of bondage that still prevail in the
      villages of central Russia." 
    

      This same Dyelo Naroda, in the same leading article of
      September 29, says that "the dead hand of Stolypin is still
      making itself strongly felt" in the methods employed by the
      "revolutionary ministers"; in other words, putting it more
      clearly and simply, it brands Kerensky, Nikitin, Kishkin and
      Co. as Stolypins. 
    

      The "Stolypins" Kerensky and Co. have driven the peasants to
      revolt, are now taking "military measures" against the peasants,
      are trying to soothe the people with the convocation of the
      Constituent Assembly (although Kerensky and Tsereteli have
      already deceived the people once by solemnly
      proclaiming on July 8 that the Constituent Assembly would be
      convened on the appointed date, September 17; they then
      broke their promise and postponed the Constituent
      Assembly even against the advice of the Menshevik Dan,
      postponed the Constituent Assembly not to the end of October as
      the Menshevik Central Executive Committee of that time wished,
      but to the end of November). The "Stolypins" Kerensky and
      Co. are trying to soothe the people with the imminent
      convocation of the Constituent Assembly, as if the people can
      believe those who have already lied in this matter, as if the
      people can believe that the Constituent Assembly will be
      properly convened by a government which has taken
      military measures in remote villages, that is to say,
      is openly conniving at the arbitrary arrest of class-conscious
      peasants and the rigging of the elections. 
    

      The government has driven the peasants to revolt and now has the
      effrontery to say to them: "You must 'be patient', you must
      wait, trust the government which is pacifying insurgent
      peasants by 'military measures'!" 
    

      To bring matters to such a pitch that hundreds of thousands of
      Russian soldiers perish in the offensive after June 19, the war
      is being protracted, German sailors have mutinied and are
      throwing their officers overboard, to bring matters to such a
      pitch, all the time uttering phrases about peace but not
      offering a just peace to all the belligerents, and yet to
      have the effrontery to tell the workers and peasants, to tell
      the dying soldiers, "you must be patient", trust the government
      of the "Stolypin man" Kerensky, trust the Kornilov generals for
      another month, perhaps in that month they will send several tens
      of thousands more soldiers to the slaughter. . . . "You must be
      patient". . . . 
    

      Isn't that shameless? 
    

      But you won't fool the soldiers, gentlemen of the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, Kerensky's fellow party members. 
    

      The workers and soldiers will not endure the Kerensky government
      for a single day, for an extra hour, for they know that
      the Soviet Government will immediately offer
      all the belligerents a just peace and therefore will in all
      probability achieve an immediate armistice and a speedy
      peace. 
    

      Not for a single day, not for an extra hour will the soldiers of
      our peasant army allow the Kerensky government—the
      government which is employing military measures to
      suppress the peasant revolt—to remain in power against the
      will of the Soviets. 
    

      No, gentlemen of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Kerensky's
      fellow party members, you won't fool the workers and peasants
      any more. 
*  *  *

      On the question of the pressure by hostile forces which the
      mortally frightened Novaya Zhizn assures us will sweep
      away the proletarian dictatorship, still another monstrous
      logical and political mistake is made, which only people who
      have allowed themselves to be frightened out of their wits can
      fail to see. 
    

      "Pressure by hostile forces will sweep away the proletarian
      dictatorship," you say. Very well. But you are all economists
      and educated people, dear fellow-citizens. You al] know that to
      contrast democracy to the bourgeoisie is senseless and a sign of
      ignorance; it is the same as contrasting pounds to yards, for
      there is a democratic bourgeoisie and undemocratic groups of the
      petty bourgeoisie (capable of raising a Vendée). 
    

      "Hostile forces" is merely an empty phrase. The class term is
      bourgeoisie (backed by the landowners). 
    

      The bourgeoisie and the landowners, the proletariat, and the
      petty bourgeoisie, the small proprietors, primarily the
      peasants—these are the three main "forces" into which
      Russia, like every capitalist country, is
      divided. These are the three main "forces" that have long been
      revealed in every capitalist country (including Russia) not only
      by scientific economic analysis, but also by the political
      experience of the modern history of all countries,
      by the experience of all European revolutions since the
      eighteenth century, by the experience of the two Russian
      revolutions of 1905 and 1917. 
    

      So, you threaten the proletariat with the prospect that its rule
      will be swept away by the pressure of the bourgeoisie? That, and
      that alone, is what your threat amounts to, it has no other
      meaning. 
    

      Very well. If, for example, the bourgeoisie can sweep away the
      rule of the workers and poor peasants, then the only alternative
      is a "coalition", i.e., an alliance, or agreement, between the
      petty bourgeoisie and the bourgeoisie. Nothing else can be
      contemplated! 
    

      But coalition has been tried for about six months and it has led
      to bankruptcy, and you yourselves, my dear but dense citizens of
      Novaya Zhizn, have renounced coalition. 
    

      So what do we get? 
    

      You have become so muddled, citizens of Novaya Zhizn,
      you have allowed yourselves to be so scared, that you cannot
      think straight in the extremely simple matter of counting
      even up to three, let alone up to five. 
    

      Either all power to the bourgeoisie—the slogan you have
      long ceased to advocate, and which the bourgeoisie themselves
      dare not even hint at, for they know that the people overthrew
      this power with one hitch of the shoulder at the time of the
      April 20-21 events, and would overthrow it now with thrice that
      determination and ruthlessness; or power to the petty
      bourgeoisie, i.e., a coalition (alliance, agreement) between
      them and the bourgeoisie, for the petty bourgeoisie do not wish
      to and cannot take power alone and independently, as
      has been proved by the experience of all revolutions, and as is
      proved by economics, which explains that in a capitalist country
      it is possible to stand for capital and it is possible to stand
      for labour, but it is impossible to stand for long in
      between. In Russia this coalition has for six months tried
      scores of ways and failed. 
    

      Or, finally, all power to the proletarians and the poor peasants
      against the bourgeoisie in order to break their resistance. This
      has not yet been tried, and you, gentlemen of Novaya
      Zhizn, are dissuading the people from this, you
      are trying to frighten them with your own fear of the
      bourgeoisie. 
    

      No fourth way can be invented. 
    

      If Novaya Zhizn, therefore, is afraid of the
      proletarian dictatorship and rejects it because, as it claims,
      the proletarian power may be defeated by the bourgeoisie, it is
      tantamount to its surreptitiously reverting to the
      position of compromise with the capitalists! It is as
      clear as daylight, that whoever is afraid of resistance, whoever
      does not believe that it is possible to break this resistance,
      whoever warns the people: "beware of the resistance of the
      capitalists, you will not be able to cope with it", is
      thereby again calling for compromise with the
      capitalists. 
    

Novaya Zhizn is hopelessly and pitifully muddled, as
      are all the petty-bourgeois democrats who now realise that the
      coalition is bankrupt, dare not defend it openly and, at the
      same time, protected by the bourgeoisie, fear the transfer of
      all power to the proletarians and poor peasants. 
    
*  *  *

      To fear the resistance of the capitalists and yet to call
      oneself a revolutionary, to wish to be regarded as a
      socialist—isn't that disgraceful? How low must
      international socialism, corrupted by opportunism, have fallen
      ideologically if such voices could be raised? 
    

      We have already seen the strength of the capitalists'
      resistance; the entire people have seen it, for the capitalists
      are more class-conscious than the other classes and at once
      realised the significance of the Soviets, at once exerted
      all their efforts to the utmost, resorted to
      everything, went to all lengths, resorted to the most incredible
      lies and slander, to military plots in order to frustrate
      the Soviets, to reduce them to nought, to prostitute them
      (with the aid of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries),
      to transform them into talking-shops, to wear down the peasants
      and workers by months and months of empty talk and playing at
      revolution. 
    

We have not yet seen, however, the strength of
      resistance of the proletarians and poor peasants, for this
      strength will become fully apparent only when power is in the
      hands of the proletariat, when tens of millions of people who
      have been crushed by want and capitalist slavery see from
      experience and feel that state power has passed into
      the hands of the oppressed classes, that the state is helping
      the poor to fight the landowners and capitalists, is
      breaking their resistance. Only then shall we
      see what untapped forces of resistance to the capitalists are
      latent among the people; only then will what Engels called
      "latent socialism"[11] manifest itself. Only then, for every
      ten thousand overt and concealed enemies of
      working-class rule, manifesting themselves actively or by
      passive resistance, there will arise a million new
      fighters who had been politically dormant, writhing in the
      torments of poverty and despair, having ceased to believe that
      they were human, that they had the right to live, that they too
      could be served by the entire might of the modern centralised
      state, that contingents of the proletarian militia could, with
      the fullest confidence, also call upon them to take a
      direct, immediate, daily part in state administration. 
    

      The capitalists and landowners, with the kind help of Plekhanov,
      Breshkovskaya, Tsereteli, Chernov and Co., have done
      everything in their power to defile the democratic
      republic, to defile it by servility to wealth to such a
      degree that the people are being overcome by apathy,
      indifference; it is all the same to them, because the
      hungry man cannot see the difference between the republic and
      the monarchy; the freezing, barefooted, worn-out soldier
      sacrificing his life for alien interests is not inclined to love
      the republic. 
    

      But when every labourer, every unemployed worker, every cook,
      every ruined peasant sees, not from the newspapers, but with his
      own eyes, that the proletarian state is not cringing to wealth
      but is helping the poor, that this state does not hesitate to
      adopt revolutionary measures, that it confiscates surplus stocks
      of provisions from the parasites-and distributes them to the
      hungry, that it forcibly installs the homeless in the houses of
      the rich, that it compels the rich to pay for milk but does not
      give them a drop until the children of all poor
      families are sufficiently supplied, that the land is being
      transferred to the working people and the factories and banks
      are being placed under the control of the workers, and that
      immediate and severe punishment is meted out to the millionaires
      who conceal their wealth—when the poor see and feel this,
      no capitalist or kulak forces, no forces of world finance
      capital which manipulates thousands of millions, will vanquish
      the people's revolution; on the contrary, the socialist
      revolution will triumph all over the world for it is
      maturing in all countries. 
    

      Our revolution will be invincible if it is not afraid of itself,
      if it transfers all power to the proletariat, for behind us
      stand the immeasurably larger, more developed, more organised
      world forces of the proletariat which are temporarily held down
      by the war but not destroyed; on the contrary, the war has
      multiplied them. 
    
*  *  *

      How can one be afraid that the Bolshevik government, that is to
      say, the proletarian government, which is assured of the devoted
      support of the poor peasants, will be "swept away" by the
      capitalist gentlemen! What short 
      sightedness! What disgraceful fear of the people! What
      hypocrisy! Those who show this fear belong to that "high" (by
      capitalist standards, but actually rotten) "society"
      which utters the word "justice" without believing in it, from
      habit, as a trite phrase, attaching no meaning to it. 
    

      Here is an example. 
    

      Mr. Peshekhonov is a well-known semi-Cadet. A more moderate
      Trudovik, one of the same mind as the Breshkovskayas and
      Plekhanovs, will not be found. There has never been a minister
      more servile to the bourgeoisie. The world had never seen a more
      ardent advocate of "coalition", of compromise with the
      capitalists. 
    

      Here are the admissions this gentleman was forced to
      make in his speech at the "Democratic" (read: Bulygin)
      Conference as reported by the defencist Izvestia: 
    

      "There are two programmes. One is the programme of group claims,
      class and national claims. This programme is most frankly
      advocated by the Bolsheviks. It is not easy, however, for the
      other sections of the democracy to reject this programme. They
      are the claims of the working people, the claims of the cheated
      and oppressed nationalities. It is not so easy, therefore, for
      the democracy to break with the Bolsheviks, to reject these
      class demands, primarily because in essence these demands are
      just. But this programme, for which we fought before the
      revolution, for the sake of which we made the revolution, and
      which we would all unanimously support under other
      circumstances, constitutes a very grave danger under present
      conditions. The danger is all the greater now because these
      demands have to be presented at a time when it is impossible for
      the state to comply with them. We must first defend the
      whole—the state, to save it from doom, and there is only
      one way to do that, not the satisfaction of demands, however
      just and cogent they may be, but, on the contrary, restriction
      and sacrifice, which must be contributed from all
      quarters. (Izvestia, September 17.) 
    

      Mr. Peshekhonov fails to understand that as long as the
      capitalists are in power he is defending not the whole,
      but the selfish interests of Russian and "Allied" imperialist
      capital. Mr. Peshekhonov fails to understand that the war would
      cease to be an imperialist, predatory war of annexation only
      after a rupture with the capitalists, with their secret
      treaties, with their annexations (seizure of alien
      territory), with their banking and financial
      swindles. Mr.Peshekhonov fails to understand that only
      after this would the war become—if the enemy
      rejected the formal offer of a just peace—a defensive war,
      a just war. Mr. Peshekhonov fails to understand that the defence
      potential of a country that has thrown off the yoke of capital,
      that has given the peasants land and has placed the banks and
      factories under workers' control, would be many times
      greater than the defence potential of a capitalist country. 
    

      The main thing that Mr. Peshekhonov fails to
      understand is that he surrenders his entire position,
      the entire position of the entire petty-bourgeois democracy
      when he is forced to admit the justice of Bolshevism, to admit
      that its demands are the demands of the "working
      people", i.e., of the majority of the people. 
    

      This is where our strength lies. This is why our government will
      be invincible; because even our opponents are forced to admit
      that the Bolshevik programme is that of the "working people" and
      the "oppressed nationalities". 
    

      After all, Mr. Peshekhonov is the political friend of the
      Cadets, of the Yedinstvo and Dyelo Naroda people, of
      the Breshkovskayas and Plekhanovs, he is the representative of
      the kulaks and of the gentlemen whose wives and sisters would
      come tomorrow to gouge out with their umbrellas the eyes of
      wounded Bolsheviks if they were to be defeated by Kornilov's or
      (which is the same thing) Kerensky's troops. 
    

      A gentleman like that is forced to admit the "justice"
      of the Bolshevik demands. 
    

      For him "justice" is merely an empty phrase. For the mass of
      semi-proletarians, however, and for the majority of the urban
      and rural petty bourgeoisie who have been ruined, tortured and
      worn out by the war, it is not an empty phrase, but a most
      acute, most burning and immense question of death from
      starvation, of a crust of bread. That is why no policy
      can be based on a "coalition", on a "compromise" between the
      interests of the 
      starving and ruined and the interests of the exploiters. That is
      why the Bolshevik government is assured of the support
      of the overwhelming majority of these people. 
    

      Justice is an empty word, say the intellectuals and those
      rascals who are inclined to proclaim themselves Marxists on the
      lofty grounds that they have "contemplated the hind
      parts" of economic materialism. 
    

      Ideas become a power when they grip the people. And precisely at
      the present time the Bolsheviks, i.e., the representatives of
      revolutionary proletarian internationalism, have embodied in
      their policy the idea that is motivating countless working
      people all over the world. 
    

      Justice alone, the mere anger of the people against
      exploitation, would never have brought them on to the true path
      of socialism. But now that, thanks to capitalism, the material
      apparatus of the big banks, syndicates, railways, and so forth,
      has grown, now that the immense experience of the advanced
      countries has accumulated a stock of engineering marvels, the
      employment of which is being hindered by capitalism,
      now that the class-conscious workers have built up a party of a
      quarter of a million members to systematically lay hold of this
      apparatus and set it in motion with the support of all the
      working and exploited people—now that these conditions
      exist, no power on earth can prevent the Bolsheviks, if they
      do not allow themselves to be scared and if they succeed in
      taking power, from retaining it until the triumph of the world
      socialist revolution. 
    

      AFTERWORD 
    

      The foregoing lines were already written when the leading
      article in Novaya Zhizn of October 1 produced another
      gem of stupidity which is all the more dangerous because it
      professes sympathy with the Bolsheviks and offers most sagacious
      philistine admonitions "not to allow yourselves to be provoked"
      (not to allow ourselves to be caught in the trap of screams
      about provocation, the object of which is to frighten the
      Bolsheviks and cause them to refrain from taking
      power). 
    

      Here is this gem: 
    

      "The lessons of movements, like that of July 3-5, on the one
      hand, and of the Kornilov days, on the other, have shown quite
      clearly that the democracy, having at its command organs that
      exercise immense influence among the population, is invincible
      when it takes a defensive position in civil war, and that it
      suffers defeat, loses all the middle vacillating groups when it
      takes the initiative and launches an offensive ." 
    

      If the Bolsheviks were to yield in any form and in the slightest
      degree to the philistine stupidity of this argument they would
      ruin their Party and the revolution. 
    

      For the author of this argument, taking it upon himself to talk
      about civil war (just the subject for a lady with many good
      points), has distorted the lessons of history on this
      question in an incredibly comical manner. 
    

      This is how these lessons, the lessons of history on
      this question, were treated by the representative and
      founder of proletarian revolutionary tactics, Karl Marx: 
    

      "Now, insurrection is an art quite as much as war or any other
      art, and is subject to certain procedural rules 
      which, when neglected, will bring about the downfall of the
      party neglecting them. These rules, logical deductions from the
      nature of the parties and the circumstances you have to deal
      with in such a case, are so plain and simple that the brief
      experience of 1848 made the Germans fairly well acquainted with
      them. Firstly, never play with insurrection unless you are fully
      prepared to go the whole way "Insurrection is an equation with
      very indefinite magnitudes, the value of which may change every
      day; the forces opposed to you have all the advantage of
      organisation, discipline and habitual authority [Marx has in
      mind the most "difficult" case of insurrection: against the
      "firmly established" old authority, against the army not yet
      disintegrated by the influence of the revolution and the
      vacillation of the government]; unless you bring strong odds
      against them you are defeated and ruined. Secondly, once you
      have entered upon the insurrectionary career, act with the
      greatest determination, and on the offensive. The defensive is
      the death of every armed rising; it is lost before it measures
      itself with its enemies. Surprise your antagonists while their
      forces are scattered, prepare the way for new successes, however
      small, but prepare daily; keep up the moral superiority which
      the first successful rising has given to you; rally in this way
      those vacillating elements to your side which always follow the
      strongest impulse and which always look out for the safer side;
      force your enemies to retreat before they can collect their
      strength against you; in the words of Danton, the greatest
      master of revolutionary tactics yet known: de l'audace,
      de l'audace, encore de l'audace!"
      (Revolution and Counter-revolution in Germany, German
      edition, 1907, p. 118.) 
    

      We have changed all that, the "would-be Marxists" of Novaya
      Zhizn may say about themselves; instead of triple audacity
      they have two virtues: "We have two, sir: moderation and
      accuracy."[12] For "us", the experience of world history, the
      experience of the Great French Revolution, is 
 
      * Interpolations in square brackets (within passages quoted by
        Lenin) have been introduced by Lenin unless otherwise
        indicated.—Ed. nothing. The important thing for
        "us" is the experience of the two movements in 1917, distorted
        by Molchalin spectacles. 
    

      Let us examine this experience without these charming
      spectacles. 
    

      You compare July 3-5 with "civil war", because you believed
      Alexinsky, Pereverzev and Co. It is typical of the gentlemen of
      Novaya Zhizn that they believe such people
      (and do absolutely nothing themselves to collect
      information about July 3-5, although they have the huge
      apparatus of a big daily newspaper at their disposal). 
    

      Let us assume for a moment, however, that July 3-5 was not the
      rudiment of civil war that was kept within the rudimentary stage
      by the Bolsheviks, but actual civil war. Let us assume this. 
    

      In that case, then, what does this lesson prove? 
    

      First, the Bolsheviks did not take the offensive, for
      it is indisputable that on the night of July 3-4, and even on
      July 4, they would have gained a great deal if they had taken
      the offensive. Their defensive position was their weakness, if
      we are to speak of civil war (as Novaya Zhizn does, and
      not of converting a spontaneous outburst into a demonstration of
      the type of April 20-21, as the facts show). 
    

      The "lesson" therefore proves that the wise men of Novaya
      Zhizn are wrong. 
    

      Secondly, if the Bolsheviks did not even set out to start an
      insurrection on July 3 or 4, if not a single Bolshevik
      body even raised such a question, the reason for it
      lies beyond the scope of our controversy with
      Novaya Zhizn. For we are arguing about the
      lessons of "civil war", i.e., of insurrection, and not
      about the point that obvious lack of a majority to support it
      restrains the revolutionary party from thinking of
      insurrection. 
    

      Since everybody knows that the Bolsheviks received a majority in
      the metropolitan Soviets and in the country (over 49 per cent of
      the Moscow votes) much later than July 1917, it again
      follows that the "lessons" are far, far from what Novaya
      Zhizn, that lady with many good points, would like them to
      be. 
    

      No, no, you had better not meddle with politics, citizens of
      Novaya Zhizn! 
    

      If the revolutionary party has no majority in the advanced
      contingents of the revolutionary classes and in the country,
      insurrection is out of the question. Moreover, insurrection
      requires: (1) growth of the revolution on a country-wide scale;
      (2) the complete moral and political bankruptcy of the old
      government, for example, the "coalition" government; (3) extreme
      vacillation in the camp of all middle groups, i.e., those who do
      not fully support the government, although they did fully
      support it yesterday. 
    

      Why did Novaya Zhizn, when speaking of the "lessons" of
      July 3-5, fail even to note this very important lesson? Because
      a political question was not dealt with by politicians but by a
      circle of intellectuals who had been terrified by the
      bourgeoisie. 
    

      To proceed. Thirdly, the facts show that it was after
      July 3-4 that the rot set in among the Socialist-Revolutionaries
      and Mensheviks, precisely because the Tseretelis had
      exposed themselves by their July policy,
      precisely because the mass of the people realised that
      the Bolsheviks were their own front-rank fighters and
      that the "social-bloc" advocates were traitors. Even
      before the Kornilov revolt this rot was fully revealed by
      the Petrograd elections on August 20, which resulted in a
      victory for the Bolsheviks and the rout of the "social-bloc"
      advocates (Dyelo Naroda recently tried to refute this
      by concealing the returns for all parties, but this was
      both self-deception and deception of its readers; according to
      the figures published in Dyen of August 24, covering
      only the city, the Cadets' share of the total vote increased
      from 22 to 23 per cent, but the absolute number of votes cast
      for the Cadets dropped 40 per cent; the Bolsheviks' share of the
      total vote increased from 20 to 33 per cent, while the absolute
      number of votes cast for the Bolsheviks dropped only 10 per
      cent; the share of all "middle groups" dropped from 58 to 44 per
      cent, but the absolute number of votes cast for them dropped 60
      per cent!). 
    

      That a rot had set in among the Socialist-Revolutionaries and
      Mensheviks after the July days and before the Kornilov days is
      also proved by the growth of the Left wings in both parties,
      reaching almost 40 per cent: this is "retribution" for the
      persecution of the Bolsheviks by the Kerenskys. 
    

      In spite of the "loss" of a few hundred members, the proletarian
      party gained enormously from July 3-4, for it was
      precisely during those stern days that the people
      realised and saw its devotion and the treachery of the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. So, the "lesson" is
      far, very far from being of the Novaya Zhizn sort, it
      is one entirely different, namely: don't desert the seething
      masses for the "Molchalins of democracy"; and if you launch an
      insurrection, go over to the offensive while the enemy forces
      are scattered, catch the enemy unawares. 
    

      Is that not so, gentlemen "would-be Marxists" of Novaya
      Zhizn? 
    

      Or does "Marxism" mean not basing tactics on an exact appraisal
      of the objective situation but senseless]y and
      uncritically lumping together "civil war" and "a Congress of
      Soviets and the convocation of the Constituent Assembly"? 
    

      But this is simply ridiculous, gentlemen, this is a sheer
      mockery of Marxism and of logic in general! 
    

      If there is nothing in the objective situation
      that warrants the intensification of the class struggle to the
      point of "civil war", why did you speak of "civil war" in
      connection with "a Congress of Soviets and the Constituent
      Assembly"? (For this is the title of the leading article in
      Novaya Zhizn here under discussion.) In that case you
      should clearly have told the reader and proved to him that there
      is no ground in the objective situation for civil war
      and that, therefore, peaceful, constitutionally-legal,
      juridically and parliamentarily "simple" things like a Congress
      of Soviets and a Constituent Assembly can and should be the
      cornerstone of tactics. In that case it is possible to
      hold the opinion that such a congress and such an assembly are
      really capable of making decisions. 
    

      If, however, the present objective conditions harbour the
      inevitability or even only the probability of civil war, if you
      did not "idly" speak about it, but did so clearly seeing,
      feeling, sensing the existence of a situation of civil war, how
      could you make a Congress of Soviets or a Constituent Assembly
      the cornerstone? This is a sheer mockery of the starving and
      tormented people! Do you think the starving will consent to
      "wait" two months? Or that the ruin, about the increase of which
      you yourselves write every day, will 
      consent to "wait" for the Congress of Soviets or for the
      Constituent Assembly? Or that the German offensive, in the
      absence of serious steps on our part towards peace (i.e., in the
      absence of a formal offer of a just peace to all belligerents),
      will consent to "wait" for the Congress of Soviets or for the
      Constituent Assembly? Or are you in possession of facts which
      permit you to conclude that the history of the Russian
      revolution, which from February 28 to September 30 had proceeded
      with extraordinary turbulence and unprecedented rapidity, will,
      from October 1 to November 29,[13] proceed at a super-tranquil,
      peaceful, legally balanced pace that will preclude upheavals,
      spurts, military defeats and economic crises? Or will the army
      at the front, concerning which the non-Bolshevik
      officer Dubasov said officially, in the name of the front, "it
      will not fight", quietly starve and freeze until the "appointed"
      date? Or will the peasant revolt cease to be a factor of civil
      war because you call it "anarchy" and "pogrom", or because
      Kerensky will send "military" forces against the
      peasants? Or is it possible, conceivable, that the
      government can work calmly, honestly, and without
      deception to convene the Constituent Assembly in a
      peasant country when that same government is
      suppressing the peasant revolt? 
    

      Don't laugh at the "confusion in the Smolny Institute",[14]
      gentlemen! There is no less confusion in your own ranks. You
      answer the formidable questions of civil war with confused
      phrases and pitiful constitutional illusions. That is why I say
      that if the Bolsheviks were to give in to these moods they would
      ruin both their Party and their
      revolution.

    Written at Vyborg in late September-October 1 (14), 1917. First
    published in the magazine Prosveshcheniye
    (Education) No. 1-2 for October
    1917. Prosveshcheniye, a monthly Bolshevik theoretical
    journal legally published in Petersburg from December 1911 to June
    1914. It had a peak circulation of 5,000. It was put out on
    Lenin's suggestion, and contained contributions from Vorovsky,
    Ulyanova-Yelizarova, Krupskaya, Olminsky and others. Gorky edited
    the belle lettres section. Lenin directed its policy from
    Paris and then from Cracow and Poronin; he edited some of the
    articles and kept up a regular correspondence with members of the
    editorial board. The magazine reported on the working-class
    struggle at the time of the new revolutionary upsurge; it
    popularised Bolshevik slogans in the electoral campaign for the
    Fourth Duma and opposed revisionism and centrism in the parties of
    the Second International. It had a great part to play in educating
    forward-looking workers in Russia in the Marxist international
    spirit. On the eve of the First World War, in June 1914 it was
    closed down by the tsarist government, and resumed publication in
    the autumn of 1917, but only one double issue was put out. 
    

[2]  This
      happened on June 4 (17), 1917, during a speech of the Menshevik
      Tsereteli, a Minister of the Provisional Government, who had
      said that there was no political party in Russia which was
      prepared to take full power in the country. On behalf of the
      Bolshevik Party, Lenin interrupted Tsereteli with the remark:
      "There is!" In his speech from the rostrum later, Lenin declared
      that the Bolshevik Party "is ready to take over full power at
      any moment".

      Dear Comrades,
    

      Events are prescribing our task so clearly for us that
      procrastination is becoming positively criminal.

      The peasant movement is developing. The government is
      intensifying its severe repressive measures. Sympathy for us is
      growing in the army (99 per cent of the soldiers' votes were
      cast for us in Moscow, the army in Finland and the fleet are
      against the government, and there is Dubasov's evidence about
      the front in general).

    

      In Germany the beginning of a revolution is obvious, especially
      since the sailors were shot. The elections in Moscow—47 per
      cent Bolsheviks—are a tremendous victory. Together with the
      Left Socialist-Revolutionaries we have an obvious
      majority in the country.

      The railway and postal employees are in conflict with the
      government. Instead of calling the Congress for October 20, the
      Lieberdans are already talking of calling it at the end of
      October, etc., etc.
    

      Under such circumstances to “wait” would be a crime.
    

      The Bolsheviks have no right to wait for the Congress of
      Soviets, they must take power at once. By so doing they
      will save the world revolution (for otherwise there is danger of
      a deal between the imperialists of all countries, who, after the
      shootings in Germany, will be more accommodating to each other
      and will unite against us), the Russian revolution
      (otherwise a wave of real anarchy may become stronger than
      we are) and the lives of hundreds of thousands of people at
      the front.
    

      Delay is criminal. To wait for the Congress of Soviets would be
      a childish game of formalities, a disgraceful game of
      formalities, and a betrayal of the revolution.
    

      If power cannot be achieved without insurrection, we must
      resort to insurrection at once. It may very well be
      that right now power can be achieved without insurrection, for
      example, if the Moscow Soviet were to take power at once,
      immediately, and proclaim itself (together with the Petrograd
      Soviet) the government. Victory in Moscow is guaranteed, and
      there is no need to fight. Petrograd can wait. The government
      cannot do anything to save itself; it will surrender.
    

      For, by seizing power and taking over the banks, the factories
      and Russkoye Slovo, the Moscow Soviet would secure a
      tremendous basis and tremendous strength, it would be able to
      campaign throughout Russia and raise the issue thus: we shall
      propose peace tomorrow if the Bonapartist Kerensky
      surrenders (and if he does not, we shall overthrow him). We
      shall hand over the land to the peasants at
      once, we shall make concessions to the railway and
      postal employees at once, and so on.
    

      It is not necessary to “begin” with Petrograd. If
      Moscow “begins” without any blood being shed, it will
      certainly be supported by (1) the army at the front by its
      sympathy, (2) the peasants everywhere and (3) the fleet and
      the. troops in Finland, which will proceed to
      Petrograd.


      Even if Kerensky has a corps or two of mounted troops near
      Petrograd, he will be obliged to surrender. The Petrograd Soviet
      can wait and campaign for the Moscow Soviet Government. The
      slogan is: Power to the Soviets, Land to the Peasants, Peace to
      the Nations, Bread to the Starving!
    

      Victory is certain, and the chances are ten to one that it will
      be a bloodless victory.
    

      To wait would be a crime to the revolution.
    

      Greetings, 
      N. Lenin

Advice of an Onlooker

      the Pravda text

      I am writing these lines on October 8 and
      have little hope that they will reach Petrograd comrades by the
      9th. It is possible that they will arrive too late, since the
      Congress of the Northern Soviets has been fixed for October
      10. Nevertheless, I shall try to give my "Advice of an Onlooker"
      in the event that the probable action of the workers and
      soldiers of Petrograd and of the whole "region" will take place
      soon but has not yet taken place. 

    

      It is clear that all power must pass to the Soviets. It should
      be equally indisputable for every Bolshevik that proletarian
      revolutionary power (or Bolshevik power—which is now one
      and the same thing) is assured of the utmost sympathy and
      unreserved support of all the working and exploited people all
      over the world in general, in the belligerent countries in
      particular, and among the Russian peasants especially. There is
      no need to dwell on these all too well known and long
      established truths.

    

      What must be dealt with is something that is probably not quite
      clear to all comrades, namely, that in practice the transfer of
      power to the Soviets now means armed uprising. This would seem
      obvious, but not everyone has or is giving thought to the
      point. To repudiate armed uprising now would mean to repudiate
      the key slogan of Bolshevism (All Power to the Soviets) and
      proletarian revolutionary internationalism in general. 
    

      But armed uprising is a special form of political
      struggle, one subject to special laws to which attentive thought
      must be given. Karl Marx expressed this truth with remarkable
      clarity when he wrote that "insurrection is an art quite as
      much as war".  
    

      Of the principal rules of this art, Marx noted the following: 
    

      (1) Never play with insurrection, but when beginning it
         realise firmly that you must go all the way. 
    

      (2) Concentrate a great superiority of forces at the
         decisive point and at the decisive moment, otherwise the
         enemy, who has the advantage of better preparation and
         organisation, will destroy the insurgents. 
    

      (3) Once the insurrection has begun, you must act with the
         greatest determination, and by all means, without
         fail, take the of offensive. "The defensive is the
         death of every armed rising." 
    

      (4) You must try to take the enemy by surprise and seize the
         moment when his forces are scattered. 
    

      (5) You must strive for daily successes, however small
         (one might say hourly, if it is the case of one town), and at
         all costs retain "moral superiority". 
    

      Marx summed up the lessons of all revolutions in respect to
      armed uprising in the words of "Danton, the greatest master of
      revolutionary policy yet known: de l'audace, de
      l'audace, encore de l'audace ".[1]

      Applied to Russia and to October 1917, this means: a
      simultaneous offensive on Petrograd, as sudden and as rapid as
      possible, which must without fail be carried out from within and
      from without, from the working-class quarters and from Finland,
      from Revel and from Kronstadt, an offensive of the
      entire navy, the concentration of a gigantic
      superiority of forces over the 15,000 or 20,000 (perhaps
      more) of our "bourgeois guard" (the officers' schools), our
      "Vendee troops" (part of the Cossacks), etc. 
    

      Our three main forces—the fleet, the workers, and
      the army units—must be so combined as to occupy without
      fail and to hold at any cost: (a) the telephone
      exchange; (b) the telegraph office; (c) the railway stations;
      (d) and above all, the bridges. 
    

      The most determined elements (our "shock forces" and
      young workers, as well as the best of the sailors) must
      be formed into small detachments to occupy all the more
      important points and to take part everywhere in all
      important operations, for example:
    

      to encircle and cut off
      Petrograd; to seize it by a combined attack of the sailors, the
      workers, and the troops—a task which requires art and
      triple audacity;
    

      to form detachments from the best workers,
      armed with rifles and bombs, for the purpose of attacking and
      surrounding the enemy's "centres" (the officers' schools, the
      telegraph office, the telephone exchange, etc.). Their watch
      word must be: "Better die to a man than let the enemy
      pass!" 
    

      Let us hope that if action is decided on, the leaders will
      successfully apply the great precepts of Danton and Marx. 
    

      The success of both the Russian and the world revolution depends
      on two or three days' fighting.

      Comrades,
    

      Our revolution is passing through a highly critical
      period. This crisis coincides with the great crisis—the
      growth of the world socialist revolution and the struggle waged
      against it by world imperialism. A gigantic task is being
      presented to the responsible leaders of our Party, and failure
      to perform it will involve the danger of a complete collapse of
      the internationalist proletarian movement. The situation is such
      that, in truth, delay would be fatal. 

    
      Take a glance at the international situation. The growth of a
      world revolution is beyond dispute. The outburst of indignation
      on the part of the Czech workers has been suppressed with
      incredible ferocity, testifying to the government's extreme
      fright. Italy too has witnessed a mass outbreak in Turin.[1] Most
      important, however, is the revolt in the German navy. One can
      imagine the enormous difficulties of a revolution in a country
      like Germany, especially under present conditions. It cannot be
      doubted that the revolt in the German navy is indicative of the
      great crisis—the growth of the world revolution. While our
      chauvinists, who are advocating Germany's defeat, demand a
      revolt of the German workers immediately, we Russian
      revolutionary internationalists know from the experience of
      1905-17 that a more impressive sign of the growth of revolution
      than a revolt among the troops cannot be imagined. 

    
      Just think what our position is now in the eyes of the German
      revolutionaries. They can say to us: We have only Liebknecht
      who openly called for a revolution. His voice has been stifled
      in a convict prison. We have not a single newspaper which openly
      explains the necessity for a revolution; we have not got freedom
      of assembly. We have not a single Soviet of Workers' or
      Soldiers' Deputies. Our voice barely reaches the real, broad
      mass of people. Yet we made an attempt at revolt, although our
      chance was only one in a hundred. But you Russian revolutionary
      internationalists have behind you a half-year of free agitation,
      you have a score of newspapers, you have a number of Soviets of
      Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, you have gained the upper hand
      in the Soviets of Petrograd and Moscow, you have on your side
      the entire Baltic fleet and all the Russian troops in
      Finland. And still you do not respond to our call for an
      uprising, you do not overthrow your imperialist, Kerensky,
      although the chances are a hundred to one that your uprising
      will be successful. 

    
      Yes, we shall be real traitors to the International if, at such
      a moment and under such favourable conditions, we respond to
      this call from the German revolutionaries with
      . . . mere resolutions. 

    
      Add to this, as we all perfectly well know, that the plotting
      and conspiracy of the international imperialists against the
      Russian revolution are rapidly growing. International
      imperialism is coming closer to the idea of stifling the
      revolution at all costs, stifling it both by military measures
      and by a peace made at the expense of Russia. It is this that is
      making the crisis in the world socialist revolution so acute,
      and is rendering our delay of the uprising particularly
      dangerous—I would almost say criminal. 

    
      Take, further, Russia's internal situation. The petty-bourgeois
      compromising parties which expressed the naÃ¯ve confidence of the
      masses in Kerensky and in the imperialists in general, are
      absolutely bankrupt. Their collapse is complete. The vote cast
      against coalition by the Soviet curia at the Democratic
      Conference, the vote cast against coalition by a
      majority of the local Soviets of Peasants' Deputies (in
      spite of their central Soviet, where Avksentyev and other
      friends of Kerensky's are installed), the elections in Moscow,
      where the working-class population has the closest ties with the
      peasants, and where over 49 per cent voted for the
      Bolsheviks (and among the soldiers fourteen thousand out of
      seventeen thousand)—does this not signify that the
      confidence of the people in Kerensky and in those who are
      compromising with Kerensky and Co. has completely collapsed? Can
      one imagine any way in which the people could say more clearly
      to the Bolsheviks than they did by this vote, "Lead us, we shall
      follow you"? 

    
      And we, who have thus won the majority of the people over to our
      side, and who have gained the Soviets in both the capital
      cities—are we to wait? What for? For Kerensky and his
      Kornilovite generals to surrender Petrograd to the Germans, and
      thus enter directly or indirectly, openly or secretly, into a
      conspiracy with both Buchanan and Wilhelm for
      the purpose of completely stifling the Russian revolution. 

    
      By the Moscow vote and by the re-elections to the Soviets, the
      people have expressed their confidence in us, but that is not
      all. There are signs of growing apathy and indifference. That is
      understandable. It implies not the ebb of the revolution, as the
      Cadets and their henchmen vociferate, but the ebb of confidence
      in resolutions and elections. In a revolution, the masses demand
      action, not words from the leading parties, they demand
      victories in the struggle, not talk. The moment is approaching
      when the people may conceive the idea that the Bolsheviks are no
      better than the others, since they were unable to act
      when the people placed confidence in them. . . . 

    
      The peasant revolt is spreading over the whole country. It is
      perfectly clear that the Cadets and their hangers-on are
      minimising it in every way and are claiming it to be nothing but
      "riots" and "anarchy". That lie is being refuted because in the
      revolt centres the land is beginning to be handed over to the
      peasants. "Riots" and "anarchy" have never led to such splendid
      political results! The tremendous strength of the peasant revolt
      is shown by the fact that the compromisers and the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries of Dyelo Naroda, and
      even Breshko-Breshkovskaya, have begun to talk of
      transferring the land to the peasants in order to check the
      movement before it has finally engulfed them. 

    
      Are we to wait until the Cossack units of the Kornilovite
      Kerensky (who was recently exposed as a Kornilovite by the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries themselves) succeed in suppressing
      this peasant revolt piecemeal? 

    
      Apparently, many leaders of our Party have failed to note the
      specific meaning of the slogan which we all adopted and  
      which we have repeated endlessly. The slogan is "All Power to
      the Soviets". There were periods, there were moments during the
      six months of the revolution, when this slogan did not mean
      insurrection. Perhaps those periods and those moments blinded
      some of our comrades and led them to forget that now, at least
      since the middle of September, this slogan for us too has become
      equivalent to a call for insurrection.

      There can be no shadow of doubt on this score. Dyelo
      Naroda recently explained this "in a popular way", when it
      said "Kerensky will under no circumstances submit!" As if he
      could! 

    
      The slogan "All Power to the Soviets" is nothing but a call for
      insurrection. And the blame will be wholly and undoubtedly ours,
      if we, who for months have been calling upon the people to
      revolt and repudiate compromise, fail to lead them to revolt on
      the eve of the revolution's collapse, after the people have
      expressed their confidence in us.  

    
      The Cadets and compromisers are trying to scare us by citing the
      example of July 3-5, by pointing to the intensified agitation of
      the Black
      Hundreds, and so forth. But if any mistake was made on July
      3-5, it was that we did not take power. I do not think we made a
      mistake then, for at that time we were not yet in a
      majority. But now it would be a fatal mistake, worse than a
      mistake. The spread of Black Hundred agitation is
      understandable. It is an aggravation of extremes in an
      atmosphere of a developing proletarian and peasant
      revolution. But to use this as an argument against an
      uprising is ridiculous, for the impotence of the Black Hundreds,
      hirelings of the capitalists, the impotence of the Black
      Hundreds in the struggle, does not even require proof. In
      the struggle they are not worth considering. In the struggle
      Kornilov and Kerensky can only rely on the Savage Division and
      the Cossacks. And now demoralisation has set in even among the
      Cossacks; furthermore, the peasants are threatening them with
      civil war within their Cossack regions. 

    
      I am writing these lines on Sunday, October 8. You will read
      them not earlier than October 10. I have heard from a comrade
      who passed through here that people travelling on the Warsaw
      railway say, "Kerensky is bringing Cossacks to Petrograd!" This
      is quite probable, and it will be entirely our fault if we do
      not verify it most carefully and do not make a
      study of the strength and distribution of the
      Kornilovite troops of the second draft.

      Kerensky has again brought Kornilovite troops into the vicinity
      of Petrograd in order to prevent state power from passing into
      the hands of the Soviets, in order to prevent this power from
      proposing an immediate peace, in order to prevent all the land
      from being immediately handed over to the peasants, in order to
      surrender Petrograd to the Germans, and himself escape to
      Moscow! That is the slogan of the insurrection which we must
      circulate as widely as possible and which will have a tremendous
      success. 

    
      We must not wait for the All-Russia Congress of Soviets, which
      the Central Executive Committee may delay even until
      November. We must not delay and permit Kerensky to bring up more
      Kornilovite troops. Finland, the fleet and Revel are represented
      at the Congress of Soviets. These can together start an
      immediate movement on Petrograd against the Kornilovite
      regiments, a movement of the fleet, artillery, machine-guns and
      two or three army corps, such as have shown, for instance in
      Vyborg, the intensity of their hatred for the Kornilovite
      generals, with whom Kerensky is again in collusion. 

    
      It would be a great mistake to refuse to seize the opportunity
      of immediately smashing the Kornilovite regiments of the second
      draft on the ground that the Baltic fleet, by moving into
      Petrograd, would allegedly expose the front to the Germans. The
      Kornilovite slanderers will say this, as they will tell any lie,
      but it is unworthy of revolutionaries to allow themselves to be
      intimidated by lies and slanders. Kerensky will surrender
      Petrograd to the Germans, that is now as clear as daylight. No
      assertions to the contrary can destroy our full conviction that
      this is so, for it follows from the entire course of events and
      Kerensky's entire policy. 

    
      Kerensky and the Kornilovites will surrender Petrograd to the
      Germans. And it is in order to save Petrograd that Kerensky must
      be overthrown and power taken by the Soviets of both capital
      cities. These Soviets will immediately propose a peace to
      all the nations and will thereby fulfil their duty to the German
      revolutionaries. They will thereby also be taking a decisive
      step towards frustrating the criminal conspiracies against the
      Russian revolution, the conspiracies of international
      imperialism. 

    
      Only the immediate movement of troops from Finland, and of the
      Baltic fleet, Revel and Kronstadt against the Kornilovite forces
      quartered near Petrograd can save the Russian and the world
      revolution. Such a movement has a hundred to one chance of
      leading within a few days to the surrender of a part of
      the Cossack troops, to the utter defeat of the other part, and
      to the overthrow of Kerensky, for the workers and the soldiers
      of both capital cities will support such a movement. 

    
      In truth, delay would be fatal. 
    
      The slogan "All Power to the Soviets" is a slogan of
      insurrection. Whoever uses this slogan without having grasped
      this and given thought to it will have only himself to
      blame. And insurrection must be treated as an art. I
      insisted on this during the Democratic Conference and I insist
      on it now, because that is what Marxism teaches us, and
      it is what is being taught us by the present situation in Russia
      and in the world generally. 

    
      It is not a question of voting, of attracting the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, of additional provincial Soviets, or
      of a congress of these Soviets. It is a question of
      insurrection, which can and must be decided by
      Petrograd, Moscow, Helsingfors, Kronstadt, Vyborg and Revel. It
      is in the vicinity of Petrograd and in Petrograd itself
      that the insurrection can, and must be decided on and effected,
      as earnestly as possible, with as much preparation as possible,
      as quickly as possible and as energetically as possible. 

    
      The fleet, Kronstadt, Vyborg, and Revel can and must advance on
      Petrograd; they can and must smash the Kornilovite regiments,
      rouse both the capital cities, start a mass agitation for a
      government which will immediately give land to the peasants and
      immediately make proposals for peace, overthrow Kerensky's
      government and establish such a government. 

    
      Delay would be fatal.

Report 
      Minutes 

      Comrade Lenin read the resolution adopted by the Central
      Committee at the previous meeting. He stated that the resolution
      had been adopted with two dissenting votes. If the dissident
      comrades wished to make a statement, a discussion could be held;
      meanwhile he continued with the motives of the resolution.
    

      If the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary parties were to
      break with their policy of conciliation, a compromise with them
      could be proposed. The proposal had been made, but those parties
      had obviously rejected the compromise. On the other hand, by
      that time it had become definitely clear that the masses were
      following the Bolsheviks. That had been before the Korniloy
      revolt. Lenin cited election returns from Petrograd and Moscow
      as evidence. The Kornilov revolt had pushed the masses still
      more decisively to the side of the Bolsheviks. The alignment of
      forces at the Democratic Conference. The position was
      clear—either Kornilov's dictatorship or the dictatorship of
      the proletariat and the poorer strata of the peasantry. The
      Party could not be guided by the temper of the masses because it
      was changeable and incalculable; the Party must be guided by an
      objective analysis and an appraisal of the revolution. The
      masses had put their trust in the Bolsheviks and demanded deeds
      from them and not words, a decisive policy both in the struggle
      against the war and in the struggle against economic ruin. If
      the political analysis of the revolution were taken as the
      basis, it would be perfectly clear that even anarchic outbursts
      confirmed that.
    

      Lenin went on to analyse the situation in Europe and showed that
      revolution would be even more difficult in Europe than in
      Russia; if matters had gone as far as a revolt in the navy in
      such a country as Germany, there too they must already have gone
      very far. Certain objective data on the international situation
      showed that by acting at that moment the Bolsheviks would have
      all proletarian Europe on their side; he showed that the
      bourgeoisie wanted to surrender Petrograd. That could only be
      prevented by the Bolsheviks taking over Petrograd. The obvious
      conclusion from all this was—the armed uprising was on the
      order of the day as was stated in the resolution of the Central
      Committee.
    

      It would be better to draw practical conclusions from the
      resolution after hearing the reports of representatives from the
      centres.
    

      From a political analysis of the class struggle in Russia and in
      Europe there emerged the necessity to pursue the most determined
      and most active policy, which could be only the armed uprising.

      Speeches In Discussion
      Minutes

      I
    
Comrade Lenin argued against Milyutin and Schotmann
      and showed that it was not a matter of armed forces, that it was
      not a question of fighting against the troops but of one part of
      the army fighting against another. He could see no pessimism in
      what had been said there. He demonstrated that the forces on the
    side of the bourgeoisie were small. The facts showed that ours
    were superior to the enemy. Why could the Central Committee not
    begin? There was no reason that derived from the facts. To reject
    the resolution of the Central Committee it would have to be proved
    that there was no economic ruin and that the international
    situation would not lead to complications. If trade union leaders
    were in favour of full power they knew very well what they
    wanted. Objective conditions showed that the peasantry must be
    led; they would follow the proletariat.
    

      Some were afraid that Bolsheviks would not be able to maintain
      power, but at that moment there was a better chance than ever
      that they would be able to.
    

      Lenin expressed the wish that the debate be confined to the
      substance of the resolution.
    

      2
    

      If all resolutions were defeated in that manner nothing better
      could be wished for. Zinoviev was saying: do away with the
      "Power to the Soviets" slogan and bring pressure to bear on the
      government. When it was said that the time was ripe for
      insurrection there could be no question of conspiracy. Since an
      insurrection was inevitable politically, it must be regarded as
      an art. Politically, an insurrection was due.
    

      Because there was only enough bread for a day the Party could
      not wait for the Constituent Assembly. Comrade Lenin proposed
      that the resolution be approved, that energetic preparations be
      begun and that it be left to the Central Committee and the
      Soviet to decide when.
    
3

      Comrade Lenin opposed Zinoviev, saying that the revolution could
      not be contrasted to the February revolution. He proposed a
      resolution straight to the point.
    
3
      
      Resolution

      The meeting fully welcomes and fully supports the resolution of
      the Central Committee and calls upon all organisations and on
      workers and soldiers to make all-round, energetic preparations
      for an armed uprising and to support the centre set up for that
      purpose by the Central Committee; the meeting expresses its
      complete confidence that the Central Committee and the Soviet
      will indicate in good time the favourable moment and the most
      appropriate methods of attack.

Comrades,
    

      I have not yet been able to obtain the Petrograd papers for
      Wednesday, October 18. When the full text of Kamenev's and
      Zinoviev's statement in the non-Party paper Novaya
      Zhizn was transmitted to me by telephone, I refused to
      believe it. But, as it has turned out, there can be no doubt
      about it and I have to avail myself of this opportunity to get a
      letter to Party members by Thursday evening or Friday morning;
      for to remain silent in the face of such unheard-of
      strike-breaking would be a crime.
    

      The more serious the practical problem, and the more responsible
      and "prominent" the persons guilty of strikebreaking, the more
      dangerous it is, the more resolutely must the strike-breakers be
      kicked out, and the more unpardonable would it be to stop even
      to consider the past "services" of the strike-breakers.
    

      Just think of it! It has been known in Party circles that the
      Party has been discussing the question of an insurrection since
      September. Nobody has ever heard of a single letter or manifesto
      by either of the persons named! Now, on the eve, one might say,
      of the Congress of Soviets, two prominent Bolsheviks come out
      against the majority, and, obviously, against the
      Central Committee. It is not said plainly, but the harm
      done to the cause is all the greater, for to speak in hints is
      even more dangerous.
    

      It is perfectly clear from the text of Kamenev's and Zinoviev's
      statement that they have gone against the Central
      Committee, for otherwise their statement would be
      meaningless. But they do not say what specific decision
      of the Central Committee they are disputing.
    

      Why?
    

      The reason is obvious: because it has not been published by the
      Central Committee.
    

      What does this boil down to?
    

      On a burning question of supreme importance, on the eve of the
      critical day of October 20, two "prominent Bolsheviks" attack an
      unpublished decision of the Party centre and attack it in the
      non-Party press and, furthermore, in a paper which on this very
      question is hand in glove with the bourgeoisie against the
      workers' party!
      


      This is a thousand times more despicable and a million times
      more harmful than all the statements Plekhanov, for
      example, made in the non-Party press in 1906-07, and which the
      Party so sharply condemned! At that time it was only a question
      of elections, whereas now it is a question of an insurrection
      for the conquest of power!
    

      On such a question, after a decision has been taken by
      the centre, to dispute this unpublished decision in
      front of the Rodzyankos and Kerenskys in a non-Party
      paper—can you imagine an act more treacherous or
      blacklegging any worse?
    

      I should consider it disgraceful on my part if I were to
      hesitate to condemn these former comrades because of my earlier
      close relations with them. I declare outright that I no longer
      consider either of them comrades and that I will fight with all
      my might, both in the Central Committee and at the Congress, to
      secure the expulsion of both of them from the Party.
    

      A workers' party, which the course of events is confronting more
      and more frequently with the need for an insurrection, is unable
      to accomplish that difficult task if, after their adoption,
      unpublished decisions of the centre are disputed in the
      non-Party press, and vacillation and confusion are brought into
      the ranks of the fighters.
    

      Let Mr. Zinoviev and Mr. Kamenev found their own party with the
      dozens of perplexed people or with candidates for election to
      the Constituent Assembly. The workers will not loin such a
      party, for its first slogan will be:
    


"Members of the Central Committee who are defeated at a meeting
of the Central Committee on the question of a decisive fight are
permitted to resort to the non-Party press for the purpose of
attacking the unpublished decisions of the Party."
      


      Let them build themselves such a party; our workers'
Bolshevik Party will only gain from it.
    

      When all the documents are published, the strike-breaking act of
      Zinoviev and Kamenev will stand out even more
      glaringly. Meanwhile, let the workers consider the following
      question:
    


'Let us assume that the Executive Committee of an all-Russia
trade union had decided, after a month of deliberation and by a
majority of over 80 per cent, that preparations must be made for
a strike, but that for the time being neither the date nor any
other details should be divulged. Let us assume that,
after the decision had been taken, two members, under
the false pretext of a "dissenting opinion", not only began to
write to local groups urging a reconsideration of the decision,
but also permitted their letters to be communicated to non-Party
newspapers. Let us assume, finally, that they themselves
attacked the decision in non-Party papers, although it had not
yet been published, and began to vilify the strike in front of
the capitalists.
      

'We ask, would the workers hesitate to expel such blacklegs from
their midst?'
      

*    *    *

      As to the situation with regard to an insurrection now, when
      October 20 is so close at hand, I cannot judge from afar to what
      exact extent the cause has been damaged by the strikebreaking
      statement in the non-Party press. There is no doubt that very
      great practical damage has been done. In order to
      remedy the situation, it is necessary first of all to restore
      unity in the Bolshevik front by expelling the blacklegs.
    

      The weakness of the ideological arguments against an
      insurrection will become clearer, the more we drag them into the
      light of day. I recently sent an article on this subject to
      Rabochy Put, and if the editors do not find it possible
      to print it, Party members will probably acquaint themselves
      with it in the manuscript.See pp. 195-215 of
      this volume—Ed.


      There are basically two so-called "ideological"
      arguments. First, that it is necessary to "wait" for the
      Constituent Assembly. Let us wait, perhaps we can hold on until
      then— that is the whole argument. Perhaps, despite famine,
      despite economic chaos, despite the fact that the patience of
      the soldiers is exhausted, despite Rodzyanko's steps to
      surrender Petrograd to the Germans, despite the lockouts,
      perhaps we can hold on.
    

      Perhaps and maybe—that is the whole point of the argument.
    

      The second is noisy pessimism. Everything is fine with the
      bourgeoisie and Kerensky; everything is wrong with us. The
      capitalists have prepared everything wonderfully; everything is
      wrong with the workers. The "pessimists" are shouting at the top
      of their voices about the military side of the matter, but the
      "optimists" are silent, for to disclose certain things to
      Rodzyanko and Kerensky is hardly pleasant to anybody but
      blacklegs.
    

      Difficult times. A hard task. A grave betrayal.
    

      Nevertheless, the task will be accomplished; the workers will
      consolidate their ranks, the peasant revolt and the extreme
      impatience of the soldiers at the front will do their work! Let
      us close our ranks—the proletariat must win!

      Dear Comrades,
    

      No self-respecting party can tolerate strike-breaking and
      blacklegs [Scabs—Transcriber] in its
      midst. That is obvious. The more we reflect upon Zinoviev's and
      Kamenev's statement in the non-Party press, the more
      self-evident it becomes that their action is strike-breaking in
      the full sense of the term. Kamenev's evasion at the meeting of
      the Petrograd Soviet is something really despicable. He is,
      don't you see, in full agreement with Trotsky: But is it so
      difficult to understand that in the face of the enemy, Trotsky
      could not have said, he had no right to say, and should
      not have said more than he did? Is it so difficult to understand
      that it is a duty to the Party which has concealed
      its decision from the enemy (on the necessity for an
      armed uprising, on the fact that the time for it is fully ripe,
      on the thorough preparations to be made for it, etc.), and it is
      this decision that makes it obligatory in public
      statements to fasten not only the "blame", but also the
      initiative upon the adversary? Only a child could fail to
      understand that. Kamenev's evasion is a sheer fraud. The same
      must be said of Zinoviev's evasion, at least of his letter of
      "justification"(written, I think, to the Central Organ), which
      is the only document I have seen(for, as to a dissenting
      opinion, "an alleged dissenting opinion", which has been
      trumpeted in the bourgeois press, I, a member of the
      Central Committee, have to this very day seen nothing
      of it). Among Zinoviev's "arguments" there is this: Lenin, he
      says, sent out his letters "before any decisions were
      adopted", and you did not protest. That is literally what
      Zinoviev wrote, himself underlining the word before
      four times. Is it really so difficult to understand that
      before a decision has been taken on a strike by the
      centre, it is permissible to agitate for and against it; but
      that after a decision in favour of a strike (with the
      additional decision to conceal this from the enemy), to carry on
      agitation against the strike is strike-breaking? Any worker will
      understand that. The question of insurrection has been discussed
      in the centre since September. That is when Zinoviev and Kamenev
      could and should have come out in writing, so that
      everybody, upon seeing their arguments, would have
      realised that they had completely lost their heads. To conceal
      one's views from the Party for a whole month before a
      decision is taken, and to send out a dissenting opinion
      after a decision is taken—that is strike-breaking.

    
      Zinoviev pretends not to understand this difference, he pretends
      not to understand that after a decision to strike has been taken
      by the centre, only blacklegs can carry on agitation among the
      lower bodies against that decision. Any worker will understand
      that.

    
      And Zinoviev did agitate and attempted to defeat the centre's
      decision, both at Sunday's meeting, where he and Kamenev secured
      not a single vote, and in his present letter. For Zinoviev has
      the effrontery to assert that "the opinion of the Party has not
      been canvassed" and that such questions "cannot be decided by
      ten men". Just think! Every member of the Central Committee
      knows that more than ten C.C. members were present at the
      decisive meeting, that a majority of the plenary
      meeting were present, that Kamenev himself declared at the
      meeting that "this meeting is decisive", that it was known with
      absolute certainty that the majority of the absent
      members of the Central Committee were not in agreement
      with Zinoviev and Kamenev. And now, after the Central
      Committee has adopted a decision at a meeting which Kamenev
      himself admitted to be decisive, a member of the
      Central Committee has the audacity to write that "the opinion of
      the Party has not been canvassed", and that such questions
      "cannot be decided by ten men".That is strike-breaking in the
      full sense of the term. Between Party congresses, the Central
      Committee decides. The Central Committee has decided. Kamenev
      and Zinoviev, who did not come out in writing before
      the decision was taken, began to dispute the Central
      Committee's decision after it had been taken.

    
      That is strike-breaking in the full sense of the term. After a
      decision has been taken, any dispute is impermissible
      when it concerns immediate and secret preparations for
      a strike. Now Zinoviev has the insolence to blame us
      for "warning the enemy". Is there any limit to his brazenness?
      Who is it that has damaged the cause, frustrated the strike by
      "warning the enemy", if not those who came out in the
      non-Party press?

    
      How can one come out against a "decisive" resolution of
      the Party in a paper which on this question is hand in
      glove with the entire, bourgeoisie?

    
      If that is tolerated, the Party will become impossible, the
      Party will be destroyed.

    
      It is ridiculing the Party to give the name of "dissenting
      opinion" to that which Bazarov learns about and publishes in a
      non-Party paper.

    
      Kamenev's and Zinoviev's statement in the non-Party press was
      especially despicable for the additional reason that the Party
      is not in a position to refute their slanderous lie
      openly. I know of no decisions regarding the date, Kamenev
      writes and publishes his writings in his own name and in the
      name of Zinoviev. (After such a statement, Zinoviev bears full
      responsibility for Kamenev's conduct and statements.)

    
      How can the Central Committee refute this?

    
      We cannot tell the capitalists the truth, namely, that we have
      decided on a strike and have decided to conceal the
      moment chosen for it.

    
      We cannot refute the slanderous lie of Zinoviev and Kamenev
      without doing even greater damage to the cause. And the
      utter baseness, the real treachery of these two individuals is
      precisely in their having revealed the strikers' plan to the
      capitalists, for, since we remain silent in the press, everybody
      will guess how things stand.

    
      Kamenev and Zinoviev have betrayed to Rodzyanko and
      Kerensky the decision of the Central Committee of their Party on
      insurrection and the decision to conceal from the enemy
      preparations for insurrection and the date appointed for
      it. That is a fact and no evasions can refute it. Two members of
      the Central Committee have by a slanderous lie betrayed
      the decision of the workers to the capitalists. There can and
      must be only one answer to that: an immediate decision of the
      Central Committee:

    
      "The Central Committee, regarding Zinoviev's and Kamenev's
      statement in the non-Party press as strike-breaking in the full
      sense of the term, expels both of them from the Party."

    
      It is not easy for me to write in this way about former close
      comrades. But I should regard any hesitation in this respect as
      a crime, for otherwise a party of revolutionaries which does not
      punish prominent blacklegs would perish.

      The question of insurrection, even if the blacklegs have now
      delayed it for a long time by betraying it to Rodzyanko and
      Kerensky, has not been removed from the agenda, it has
      not been removed by the Party. But how can we prepare ourselves
      for insurrection and lay plans for it, if we tolerate
      "prominent" strike-breakers in our midst? The more prominent,
      the more dangerous they are, and the less deserving of
      "forgiveness". On n'est trahi que par les siens, the
      French say. Only your own people can betray you.

    
      The more "prominent" the strike-breakers are, the more
      imperative it is to punish them by immediate expulsion.

    
      That is the only way for the workers' party to recuperate, rid
      itself of a dozen or so spineless intellectuals, rally the ranks
      of the revolutionaries, and advance to meet great and momentous
      difficulties hand in hand with the revolutionary workers.
      

      We cannot publish the truth, namely, that after the
      decisive meeting of the Central Committee, Zinoviev and Kamenev
      at Sunday's meeting had the audacity to demand a
      revision, that Kamenev had the effrontery to shout:
      "The Central Committee has collapsed, for it has done nothing
      for a whole week" (I could not refute that because to
      say what really had been done was impossible), while
      Zinoviev with an air of innocence proposed this resolution,
      which was rejected by the meeting: "No action shall be taken
      before consulting with the Bolsheviks who are to arrive on
      October 20 for the Congress of Soviets."

    
      Just imagine! After the centre has taken a decision to
      call a strike, it is proposed at a meeting of the rank and file
      that it be postponed (until October 20, when the Congress was to
      convene. The Congress was subsequently postponed—the
      Zinovievs trust the Lieberdans) and be referred to a body
      such as the Party Rules do not provide for, that has
      no authority over the Central Committee, and that does
      not know Petrograd.

    
      And after this Zinoviev still has the insolence to
      write: "This is hardly the way to strengthen the unity of the
      Party."

    
      What else can you call it but a threat to effect a
      split?

    
      My answer to this threat is that I shall go the limit, I shall
      win freedom of speech for myself before the workers, and I
      shall, at whatever cost, brand the blackleg Zinoviev as
      a blackleg. My answer to the threat of a split is to declare war
      to a finish, war for the expulsion of both blacklegs from the
      Party.

    
      The Executive Committee of a trade union, after a month
      of deliberation, decides that a strike is inevitable, that the
      time is ripe, but that the date is to be concealed from the
      employers. After that, two members of the Executive Committee
      appeal to the rank and file, disputing the decision,
      and are defeated. Thereupon these two come out in the press and
      with a slanderous lie betray the decision of the Executive
      Committee to the capitalists, thus more than half wrecking the
      strike, or delaying it to a less favourable time by warning the
      enemy.

    
      Here we have strike-breaking in the full sense of the term. And
      that is why I demand the expulsion of both the black-legs,
      reserving for myself the right (in view of their threat of a
      split) to publish everything when publication becomes
      possible.

To Comrade Sverdlov. 

I learnt only last night that Zinoviev had issued a writ ten
denial of his participation in Kamenev’s statement in Novaya
Zhizn.  

Why then have you not sent me anything???  

I sent all the letters about Kamenev and Zinoviev to C.C. members
only.—You know this; is it not strange then that you seem to doubt it?


It looks as if I will not be able to attend the Plenary Meeting,
because “they are looking for me”. If you (+ Stalin, Sokolnikov
and Dzerzhinsky) demand a compromise on the Zinoviev and Kamenev
affair,{1} enter a proposal against me, to have the case
referred to a Party court (the facts are clear that Zinoviev was also
thwarting it deliberately); this will be a postponement.  
 

“Kamenev’s resignation has been accepted”? From the C.C.? Please let
me have the text of his statement.  /p>



Cancellation of the Cossacks’ demonstration is a great
victory.{2} Hurrah! If we  a t t a c k  with
a l l  o u r  s t r e n g t h,  we shall fully win out in a few
days! Best regards! Yours.

A reference to the speeches of Y. M. Sverdlov, J. V. Stalin,
F. E. Dzerzhinsky and G. Y. Sokolnikov at the Central Committee’s sitting
on October 20 (November 2), 1917, during the discussion of Lenin’s letter
to the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.)

in connection with the publication in the semi-Menshevik newspaper
Novaya Zhizn of an item entitled “Y. Kamenev on the
‘Uprising’\thinspace”, in which Kamenev, on behalf of Zinoviev and
himself, opposed the armed uprising. See Protokoly Tsentralnogo
Komiteta R.S.D.R.P.(B.). Avgust 1917–fevral 1918 (Minutes of the

The Cossack demonstration, or the Cossack “religious procession”, in
Petrograd was set for October 22 (November 4), 1917, and was regarded by
the counter-revolutionaries as a show of force in their struggle against
the mounting revolution. The Bolsheviks carried on extensive agitation
among the Cossacks urging them to refrain from taking part in the
demonstration. The Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies
issued an appeal to the Cossacks. Representatives of the Cossack regiments
were invited to a conference of regimental committees held by the Petrograd
Soviet in Smolny on October 21 (November 3). At the conference, the
Cossacks declared that they would not act against the workers and
soldiers. The night before the demonstration, the Provisional Government
was forced to call it off.

Comrades,
    

      I am writing these lines on the evening of the 24th. The
      situation is critical in the extreme. In fact it is now
      absolutely clear that to delay the uprising would be fatal.
    

      With all my might I urge comrades to realise that everything now
      hangs by a thread; that we are confronted by problems which are
      not to be solved by conferences or congresses (even congresses
      of Soviets), but exclusively by peoples, by the masses, by the
      struggle of the armed people.

    

      The bourgeois onslaught of the Kornilovites and the removal of
      Verkhovsky show that we must not wait. We must at all costs,
      this very evening, this very night, arrest the government,
      having first disarmed the officer cadets (defeating them, if
      they resist), and so on.

    

      We must not wait! We may lose everything!
    

      The value of the immediate seizure of power will be the defence
      of the people (not of the congress, but of the people,
      the army and the peasants in the first place) from the
      Kornilovite government, which has driven out Verkhovsky and has
      hatched a second Kornilov plot.

    

      Who must take power?
    

      That is not important at present. Let the Revolutionary
      Military Committee do it, or "some other institution" which
      will declare that it will relinquish power only to the true
      representatives of the interests of the people, the interests of
      the army (the immediate proposal of peace), the interests of the
      peasants (the land to be taken immediately and private property
      abolished), the interests of the starving.

    

      All districts, all regiments, all forces must be mobilised at
      once and must immediately send their delegations to the
      Revolutionary Military Committee and to the Central Committee of
      the Bolsheviks with the insistent demand that under no
      circumstances should power be left in the hands of Kerensky and
      Co. until the 25th&#151;not under any circumstances; the
      matter must be decided without fail this very evening, or this
      very night.

    

      History will not forgive revolutionaries for procrastinating
      when they could be victorious today (and they certainly will be
      victorious today), while they risk losing much tomorrow, in
      fact, they risk losing everything.

    

      If we seize power today, we seize it not in opposition to the
      Soviets but on their behalf.

    

      The seizure of power is the business of the uprising; its
      political purpose will become clear after the seizure.

    

      It would be a disaster, or a sheer formality, to await the
      wavering vote of October 25. The people have the right and are
      in duty bound to decide such questions not by a vote, but by
      force; in critical moments of revolution, the people have the
      right and are in duty bound to give directions to their
      representatives, even their best representatives, and not to
      wait for them.

    

      This is proved by the history of all revolutions; and it would
      be an infinite crime on the part of the revolutionaries were
      they to let the chance slip, knowing that the salvation of
      the revolution,the offer of peace, the salvation of
      Petrograd, salvation from famine, the transfer of the land to
      the peasants depend upon them.

    

      The government is tottering. It must be given the
      death&#151; blow at all costs.

    

      To delay action is fatal.

Introduction

      On October 25, 1917, soldiers and workers were storming the
      Winter Palace, renouncing the Provisional
      Government that for eight months had not met their demands
      of an immediate end to the war and nationalisation of the
      land. The government had been broken apart once already in
      April, and reformed into a Dual
      power. This coupling was unable to advance the demands of
      the masses, but only tied itself up into bureaucratic
      dead-lock. In July the masses swelled again pressing their
      demands for peace and land, this time not finding any
      "compromise", but bullets, mass arrests and deporations. On
      October 24, 1917, the masses took to the streets again, under
      the leadership of the Bolshevik party, and resolved not to give
      up until victory was one.
    

      Throughout the day of October 25, Lenin was in the streets and
      barracks directing the revolutionary forces. The Second
      Congress of Soviets had been convened by the Petrograd
      Central Excecutive Committee, and initial cuacases were going on
      throughout the day; though without the Bolsheviks present: they
      were on the streets. By nightfall however, Delegates swarmed
      into the Smolny Institute, and the Congress saw the tide rise to
      an overwhelming majority of boisterous and sweating Bolsheviks;
      elected to the Congress by Soviets throughout the
      country. Minority leaders took the floor first, putting forward
      plans of concilliation and backpedalling of the revolutionary
      tide, explaining that the masses ought to lay down their weapons
      and plaqards, and enter into negotiations with the Provisional
      Government. The Congress hall, packed with men and women in
      every place conceivable, let up an enourmous roar at the
      suggestion: it was time for power to go into the hands of the Soviets,
      into the hands of the people.
    

      "Lenin, whom the Congress has not yet seen, is given the floor
      for a report on peace. His appearance in
      the tribune evokes a tumultuous greeting. The trench delegates
      gaze with all their eyes at this mysterious being whom they had
      been taught to hate and whom they have learned without seeing
      him to love. "Now Lenin, gripping the edges of the
      reading-stand, let little winking eyes travel over the crowd as
      he stood there waiting, apparently oblivious to the long-rolling
      ovation, which lasted several minutes. When it finished, he said
      simply, 'We shall now proceed to construct the socialist
      order.'" 
    

      Selected exerpts of Lenin's speeches:
    

Report on Peace: "If any nation whatsoever
      is forcibly retained within the borders of a given state, if, in
      spite of its expressed desire — no matter whether expressed
      in the press, at public meetings, in the decisions of parties,
      or in protests and uprisings against national oppression —
      is not accorded the right to decide the forms of its state
      existence by a free vote, taken after the complete evacuation of
      the [aggressive] troops of the
      incorporating or, generally, of the stronger nation and without
      the least pressure being brought to bear, such incorporation is
      annexation, i.e., seizure and violence.
    

Concluding Speech on Peace: "Let everyone
      know what their governments have in mind. We do not want any
      secrets. We want a government to be always under the supervision
      of the public opinion of its country.... Our idea of strength is
      different. Our idea is that a state is strong when the people
      are politically conscious. It is strong when the people know
      everything, can form an opinion of everything and do everything
      consciously."
    

Report on Land: Voices are being raised
      here that the decree itself and the Mandate were drawn up by the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries.
      What of it? Does it matter who drew them up? As a democratic
      government, we cannot ignore the decision of the masses of the
      people, even though we may disagree with it."
    

      Trotsky explains the results:
    

      "The whole prÃ¦sidium, with Lenin at its head, stood and sang
      with excited enraptured faces and shining eyes.".... The last
      sound of the

      [International]
      died away, but the Congress remained standing, a fused human
      mass enchanted by the greatness of that which they had
      experienced. And the eyes of many rested on the short, sturdy
      figure of the man in the tribune with his extraordinary head,
      his high cheekbones and simple features, altered now by the
      shaved beard, and with that gaze of his small, slightly Mongol
      eyes which looked straight through everything. For four months
      he had been absent. His very name had almost separated itself
      from any living image. But no. He was not a myth. There he stood
      among his own — how many now of "his own" — holding
      the sheets of a message of peace to the peoples of the
      world. Even those nearest, those who knew well his place in the
      party, for the first time fully realised what he meant to the
      revolution, to the people. It was he who had taught them; it was
      he who had brought them up. Somebody's voice from the depth of
      the hall shouted a word of greeting to the leader. The hall
      seemed only to have awaited the signal. Long live Lenin! The
      anxieties endured, the doubts overcome, pride of initiative,
      triumph of victory, gigantic hopes — all poured out
      together in one volcanic eruption of gratitude and rapture...."

Calling Everyone


      The All-Russia Congress of Soviets has set up a new Soviet
      Government. Kerensky’s government has been overthrown and
      arrested. Kerensky has fled. All institutions are in the hands
      of the Soviet Government. A revolt of officer cadets who had
      been released on parole on October 25 broke out on October
      29. The revolt was suppressed that same day. Kerensky and
      Savinkov, together with the officer cadets and a part of the
      Cossacks, have made their way by deceit to Tsarskoye Syelo. The
      Soviet Government has mustered forces for the suppression of the
      new Kornilov advance on Petrograd. The fleet, headed by the
      armoured battleship Republic, has been summoned to the
      capital. Kerensky’s officer cadets and Cossacks are
      wavering. Prisoners arriving from Kerensky’s camp assure us
      that the Cossacks have been deceived and that if they come to
      realise the true state of affairs they will refuse to shoot. The
      Soviet Government is making every effort to avert bloodshed. If
      bloodshed cannot be avoided and if Kerensky’s units do
      begin to shoot, the Soviet Government will not hesitate to
      suppress the new Kerensky-Kornilov campaign ruthlessly.

    

      We announce for your information that the Congress of Soviets
      which has already dispersed, adopted two important decrees: (1)
      on the immediate transfer of all the landed estates to the
      peasant committees, and (2) on the proposal of a democratic
      peace.

    Vladimir Ulyanov (Lenin),
      Chairman of the Soviet Government

      Comrade Lenin considers that Kamenev’s policy must be
      checked at once. There is now no point in negotiating with the
      Vikzhel.[1]
      Troops must be dispatched to Moscow. He proposes a resolution on
      the Vikzhel. The Vikzhel is not represented on the Soviet, and
      must not be admitted to it; the Soviets are voluntary
      organisations, and the Vikzhel has no support among the people.

      

Comrade Lenin considers that the negotiations were to serve as
diplomatic cover for military operations. The only correct
solution would be to put an end to the wavering of the
waverers and to become firm ourselves. Assistance must be
given to the Muscovites, and our victory will be assured.  

      

Comrade Lenin considers the question a fundamental one, and
thinks it is time to put an end to wavering. It is obvious
that the Vikzhel sides with the Kaledins and Kornilovs. There
must be no vacillation. We are backed by the majority of the
workers and peasants and of the army. Nobody here has proved
that the rank and file are against us. Either with the agents
of Kaledin, or with the rank and file. We must rely on the
people, we must send propagandists into the countryside. The
Vikzhel was called upon to transport troops to Moscow; it
refused, we must appeal to the people, and they will overthrow
it.

  
      
Footnotes

[1] The
      reference is to the Bolsheviks’ participation in a
      conference called by the Vikzhel for talks on the composition of
      the government. 
    
 Vikzhel, the All-Russia Central Committee of
      the Railwaymen’s Trade Union which was dominated by the
      Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, was one of the
      bulwarks of the counter-revolution after the victory of the
      October insurrection in Petrograd. On October 29 (November 11),
      1917 it adopted a resolution calling for a so-called
      “uniform socialist government”, consisting of
      representatives of all parties, from the Bolsheviks to the
      Popular Socialists. The Conference on the composition of the
      government opened on the same day and was attended by Menshevik
      defencists, Menshevik internationalists, Right
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, and
      members of the Postal Union, the Petrograd Duma, the Executive
      Committee of the Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies, etc. The
      Bolshevik Central Committee decided to attend stating that any
      talks on the enlargement of the government and the All-Russia
      Central Executive Committee could take place only on the basis
      of the programme for Soviet power adopted by the Second Congress
      of Soviets. Kamenev and Sokolnikov were authorised by the
      Central Committee to attend. The All-Russia Central Executive
      Committee also sent its representatives to the Conference, among
      whom was Ryazanov. 
    
 The Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolutionaries expected to
      play the leading part in any coalition government and to use it
      to fight the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the
      Co-ordinating Committee set up by the Conference, they demanded
      that resistance to Kerensky’s troops be stopped and
      insisted that the All Russia Central Executive Committee should
      be replaced by a People’s Council which would have a
      majority of members representing the Executive Committee of the
      All-Russia Soviet of Peasants’ Deputies City councils and
      other organisations which they had under control They proposed
      the establishment of a new government headed by Chernov or
      Avksentyev. The Bolshevik delegates who attended took a
      conciliatory attitude and did not object to discussing the
      proposals tabled by the Mensheviks and the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
    
 The Bolshevik Central Committee discussed the question of
      negotiations with the Vikzhel and the behaviour of the Bolshevik
      delegates on November 1 (14). The majority censured the policy
      of conciliation and proposed that the talks should either be
      broken off or formulated as an ultimatum. Kamenev, Milyutin,
      Rykov and Ryazanov insisted on a continuation of the talks. A
      C.C. resolution said the parties of conciliation were
      negotiating to subvert Soviet power, and the C.C. therefore
      authorised Bolshevik representatives to attend the talks with
      the sole aim of exposing the futile attempts to set up a
      coalition government, and terminating the talks. The All-Russia
      Executive Committee discussed the progress of the talks on the
      night of November 1 (14) and adopted a Bolshevik resolution
      drawn up in the spirit of the C.C. decision of November 1
      (14). However, the opposition group of Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov,
      Milyutin, Larin, Ryazanov and others, who took a Right-wing
      opportunist stand, opposed their line to that of the Central
      Committee and fought against the C.C. decision. On November 2
      (15), the C.C. adopted a resolution on the opposition within the
      C.C. (see pp. 277-79) At the All-Russia Central Executive
      Committee meeting on the night of November 2 (15), following the
      speeches of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries who demanded a
      review of the Committee’s decision on the terms of an
      agreement, Kamenev and Zinoviev pushed through a resolution
      which clashed with that of the Central Committee adopted
      earlier. Their resolution provided for a change in the
      composition of the government and gave the Bolsheviks only half
      the government posts. The opposition voted for this
      resolution. Following the ultimatum which the majority of the
      Central Committee presented to the opposition minority (see
      pp. 280-82 on November 3 (16), Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov,
      Milyutin and Nogin withdrew from the Central Committee, while
      the last three and Teodorovich resigned from their posts of
      People’s Commissars. They were joined by Ryazanov, Larin
      and several others. On November 5 or 6 (18 or 19), the Central
      Committee once again demanded in the form of an ultimatum that
      Kamenev, Zinoviev, Ryazanov and Larin should stop their
      disrupting tactics (they had come out against the C.C. decisions
      in non-Party organisations) (see p. 301 On November 7 (20), the
      Central Committee published in Pravda an appeal to all
      members of the Party and all working classes of Russia, branding
      the opposition as deserters of the revolution who had abandoned
      the principles of Bolshevism (see pp. 303-07)

      The Central Committee considers that the present meeting is of
      historic importance and that it is therefore necessary to record
      the two positions which have been revealed here. 

    

      1. The Central Committee considers that the opposition formed
         within the Central Committee has departed completely from all
         the fundamental positions of Bolshevism and of the
         proletarian class struggle in general by reiterating the
         utterly un-Marxist talk of the impossibility of a socialist
         revolution in Russia and of the necessity of yielding to the
         ultimatums and threats of resignation on the part of the
         obvious minority in the Soviet organisation, thus thwarting
         the will and the decision of the Second All-Russia Congress
         of Soviets and sabotaging the dictatorship of the proletariat
         and the poor peasantry which has been inaugurated. 

    

      2. The Central Committee lays the whole responsibility for
         hindering revolutionary work and for the vacillations, so
         criminal at the present moment, on this opposition, and
         invites them to transfer their discussion and their
         scepticism to the press and to withdraw from the practical
         work they do not believe in. For this opposition reflects
         nothing but intimidation by the bourgeoisie and the
         sentiments of the exhausted (not the revolutionary) section
         of the population. 
    

      3. The Central Committee affirms that the purely Bolshevik
         government cannot be renounced without betraying the slogan
         of Soviet power, since the majority at the Second All-Russia
         Congress of Soviets, without excluding anybody from the
         Congress, entrusted power, to this government. 
    

      4. The Central Committee affirms that, without betraying the
         slogan of the power of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and
         Peasants' Deputies, there can be no entering into petty
         bargaining over the affiliation to the Soviets of
         organisations of a non-Soviet type, i.e., organisations which
         are not voluntary associations of the revolutionary vanguard
         of the people who are fighting for the overthrow of the
         landowners and capitalists. 
    

      5. The Central Committee affirms that to yield to the ultimatums
         and threats of the minority of the Soviets would be
         tantamount to complete renunciation not only of Soviet power
         but of democracy, for such yielding would be tantamount to
         the majority's fear to make use of its majority, it would be
         tantamount to submitting to anarchy and inviting the
         repetition of ultimatums on the part of any minority. 
    

      6. The Central Committee affirms that, not having excluded
         anybody from the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, it is
         even now fully prepared to permit the return of those who
         walked out and to agree to a coalition within the Soviets
         with those who walked out, and that, consequently, all talk
         about the Bolsheviks refusing to share power with anybody is
         absolutely false. 
    

      7. The Central Committee affirms that on the day the present
         government was formed, a few hours before its formation, the
         Central Committee invited three representatives of the Left
         Socialist-Revolutionaries to attend its meeting and formally
         proposed that they should join the government. The refusal of
         the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, although it was
         provisional and conditional, places on these Left
         Socialist-Revolutionaries the entire responsibility for the
         fact that an agreement with them was not reached. 
    

      8. The Central Committee recalls that a resolution, proposed by
         the Bolshevik group, was adopted by the Second All-Russia
         Congress of Soviets expressing readiness to reinforce the
         Soviet both by soldiers from the trenches and by peasants
         from the localities, from the villages, and that therefore
         the assertion that the Bolshevik government is opposed to a
         coalition with the peasants is absolutely false. On the
         contrary, the Central Committee declares that the land law of
         our government, which was wholly copied from the
         Socialist-Revolutionary Mandate, is practical proof of the
         complete and most sincere readiness of the Bolsheviks to
         effect a coalition with the vast majority of Russia's
         population. 
    

      9. The Central Committee affirms, finally, that despite all
         difficulties, the victory of socialism both in Russia and in
         Europe can only be ensured by the unswerving continuation of
         the present government's policy. The Central Committee
         expresses its firm belief in the victory of this socialist
         revolution and calls upon all sceptics and waverers to
         abandon their waverings and whole-heartedly and with supreme
         energy support the actions of this government.

      The majority on the Central Committee of the
      R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks), fully approving the policy so far
      pursued by the Council of People's Commissars, considers it
      necessary to address the following categorical statement to the
      minority on the Central Committee.

    

      Our Party's policy at the present moment is defined in the
      resolution submitted by Comrade Lenin and adopted yesterday,
      November 2, by the Central Committee.[See
      pp. 277-79 of this volume.  This resolution
      declares that every attempt to induce our Party to decline power
      is treason to the proletariat's cause, since the All-Russia
      Congress of Soviets, in the name of the millions of workers,
      soldiers and peasants, has entrusted this power to the
      representatives of our Party on the basis of our programme. This
      fundamental line of our tactics, which follows logically from
      our whole struggle against the conciliators and which guided us
      in the uprising against Kerensky's government, at present
      constitutes the revolutionary essence of Bolshevism and is once
      again endorsed by the Central Committee. This line is absolutely
      binding on all members of the Party, and first and foremost, on
      the Central Committee minority. 

    

      Yet members of the minority, both before and after yesterday's
      meeting of the Central Committee, have been pursuing a policy
      which obviously runs counter to our Party's fundamental line and
      which is demoralising our own ranks by causing hesitation at a
      moment when the greatest firmness and steadfastness are
      essential.

    

      Thus, at yesterday's meeting of the Central Executive Committee,
      the Bolshevik group, with the direct participation of the
      Central Committee's minority members, openly voted against a
      decision of the Central Committee (on the number and persons of
      the representatives of our Party in the government). This
      unparalleled violation of discipline, committed by Central
      Committee member's behind the back of the Central Committee
      after many hours' discussions on the Central Committee,
      discussions provoked by these same members of the opposition,
      makes it obvious to us that the opposition intend to force the
      hand of Party institutions by sabotaging the Party's work at a
      moment when the fate of the Party, the fate of the revolution,
      depends upon the immediate result of this work.

    

      We cannot and do not wish to bear responsibility for such a
      state of affairs.

    

      Addressing the present statement to the minority of the Central
      Committee, we categorically demand a written reply to the
      question: Does the minority undertake to submit to Party
      discipline and to carry out the policy formulated in Comrade
      Lenin's resolution which was adopted by the Central Committee?

    

      In the event of a negative or indefinite reply to this question
      we shall immediately place before the Petrograd Committee, the
      Moscow Committee, the Bolshevik group on the Central Executive
      Committee, the Petrograd City Conference and the Extraordinary
      Party Congress, the following alternative proposal:

    
      
      Either the Party must entrust the present opposition with the
      task of forming a new government in conjunction with those of
      its allies on whose behalf the opposition is at present
      sabotaging our work—in which case we shall consider
      ourselves absolutely free in relation to this new government,
      which can contribute nothing but wavering, impotence and chaos.

    
      
      Or—which we do not doubt—the Party will endorse the
      only possible revolutionary line, as expressed in yesterday's
      decision of the Central Committee—in which case the Party
      must categorically demand that the members of the opposition
      conduct their disorganising work outside our Party
      organisation. There is not and cannot be any other solution. It
      stands to reason, a split would be highly deplorable. But an
      honest and open split would now be incomparably better than
      internal sabotage, the thwarting of our own decisions,
      disorganisation and prostration. At any rate, we do not doubt
      for a moment that the submission of our differences (which are
      in the main a replica of our differences with the Novaya
      Zhizn and Martov groups) to the people's judgement will
      ensure our policy the unreserved and devoted support of the
      revolutionary workers, soldiers and peasants, and will very soon
      condemn the wavering opposition to impotent isolation.

      Comrades—workers, soldiers, peasants and all working people!
    
      The workers’ and peasants’ revolution has definitely
    triumphed in Petrograd, having dispersed or arrested the last
    remnants of the small number of Cossacks deceived by Kerensky. The
    revolution has triumphed in Moscow too. Even before the arrival of
    a number of troop trains dispatched from Petrograd, the officer
    cadets and other Kornilovites in Moscow signed peace
    terms—the disarming of the cadets and the dissolution of the
    Committee of Salvation.[1]

      Daily and hourly reports are coming in from the front and from
      the villages announcing the support of the overwhelming majority
      of the soldiers in the trenches and the peasants in the uyezds
      for the new government and its decrees on peace and the
      immediate transfer of the land to the peasants. The victory of
      the workers’ and peasants’ revolution is assured
      because the majority of the people have already sided with it.

    
      It is perfectly understandable that the landowners and
      capitalists, and the top groups of office employees and
      civil servants closely linked with the bourgeoisie, in a word,
      all the wealthy and those supporting them, react to the new
      revolution with hostility, resist its victory, threaten to close
      the banks, disrupt or bring to a standstill the work of the
      different establishments, and hamper the revolution in every
      way, openly or covertly. Every politically-conscious worker was
      well aware that we would inevitably encounter resistance of this
      kind. The entire Party press of the Bolsheviks has written about
      this on numerous occasions. Not for a single minute will the
      working classes be intimidated by this resistance; they will not
      falter in any way before the threats and strikes of the
      supporters of the bourgeoisie.

    
      The majority of the people are with us. The majority of the
      working and oppressed people all over the world are with
      us. Ours is the cause of justice. Our victory is assured.

    
      The resistance of the capitalists and the high-ranking employees
      will be smashed. Not a single person will be deprived of his
      property except under the special state law proclaiming
      nationalisation of the banks and syndicates. This law is being drafted. Not one of
      the working people will suffer the loss of a kopek; on the
      contrary, he will be helped. Apart from the strictest accounting
      and control, apart from levying the set taxes in full the
      government has no intention of introducing any other measure.

    
      In support of these just demands the vast majority of the people
      have rallied round the Provisional Workers’ and
      Peasants’ Government.

    
      Comrades, working people! Remember that now you yourselves are
      at the helm of state. No one will help you if you yourselves do
      not unite and take into your hands all aflairs
      of the state. Your Soviets are from now on the organs
      of state authority, legislative bodies with full powers.

    
      Rally around your Soviets. Strengthen them. Get on with the job
      yourselves; begin right at the bottom, do not wait for
      anyone. Establish the strictest revolutionary law and order,
      mercilessly suppress any attempts to create anarchy by
      drunkards, hooligans, counter-revolutionary officer cadets,
      Kornilovites and their like.

    
      Ensure the strictest control over production and accounting of
      products. Arrest and hand over to the revolutionary courts all
      who dare to injure the people’s cause, irrespective of
      whether the injury is manifested in sabotaging production
      (damage, delay and subversion), or in hoarding grain and
      products or holding up shipments of grain, disorganising the
      railways and the postal, telegraph and telephone services, or
      any resistance whatever to the great cause of peace, the cause
      of transferring the land to the peasants, of ensuring
      workers’ control over the production and distribution of
      products.

    
      Comrades, workers, soldiers, peasants and all working people!
      Take all power into the hands of your Soviets. Be watchful and
      guard like the apple of your eye your land, grain, factories,
      equipment, products, transport—all that from now onwards
      will be entirely your property, public property. Gradually, with
      the consent and approval of the majority of the peasants, in
      keeping with their practical experience and that of the
      workers, we shall go forward firmly and unswervingly to the
      victory of socialism—a victory that will be sealed by the
      advanced workers of the most civilised countries, bring the
      peoples lasting peace and liberate them from all oppression and
      exploitation.

      Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars

      In reply to numerous questions from peasants, be it known that
      all power in the country henceforth belongs wholly to the
      Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’
      Deputies. The workers’ revolution has won in Petrograd and
      Moscow and is winning everywhere else in Russia. The
      Workers’ and Peasants’ Government ensures the alliance
      of the mass of the peasants, the poor peasants, the majority of
      the peasants, with the workers against the landowners, against
      the capitalists.

    
      Hence the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies, primarily the
      uyezd and then the gubernia Soviets, are from now on, pending
      the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, vested with full
      governmental authority in their localities. Landed
      proprietorship has been abolished by the Second All-Russia
      Congress of Soviets. A decree on land has already been issued by
      the present Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’
      Government. In conformity with this decree aU landed estates
      pass over wholly to the Soviets of Peasants’ Deputies.
    
      The volost land committees must at once take over the
      administration of all landed estates, instituting the strictest
      accounting, maintaining perfect order and safeguarding with
      utmost strictness the former property of the landowners, which
      henceforth is the property of the whole people and which the
      people themselves must therefore protect.
    
      All rulings of the volost land committees issued with
      the approval of the uyezd Soviets of peasants’
      Deputies have the force of law and must be carried out
      unconditionally and without delay.
    
      The Workers’ and Peasants’ Government appointed by the
      Second All-Russia. Congress of Soviets has been named the
      Council of People’s Commissars.
    
      The Council of People’s Commissars calls upon the peasants
      to take all power into their own hands in their respective
      localities. The workers give their full, undivided, all-round
      support to the peasants, are getting the production of machines
      and implements started, and ask the peasants to help by
      delivering grain.

To Comrades Kamenev, Zinoviev, Ryazanov and Larin


      Once before, the Central Committee delivered an ultima—turn
      to the leading exponents of your policy (Kamenev and Zinoviev),
      demanding complete subordination to the Central Committee’s
      line and decisions, and renunciation of efforts to sabotage its
      work and of all subversive activity. [See
      pp. Ultimatum to the Majority
      inthis volume. —Transcriber]

      By leaving the Central Committee, but remaining in the Party,
      the exponents of your policy undertook to abide by Central
      Committee decisions. Actually, however, you have not confined
      yourselves to criticism within the Party, but have brought
      confusion into the ranks of the fighters- in an uprising which
      is still going on, and continue, in violation of Party
      discipline, to frustrate Central Committee decisions and hamper
      its work outside the Party, in the Soviets, the municipal
      bodies, the trade unions, etc.
    
      In view of this, the Central Committee is forced to restate its
      ultimatum and to request that you immediately pledge yourselves
      in writing either to abide by Central Committee decisions and to
      conduct its policy in all your statements, or to withdraw from
      all Party activity in public and resign from all responsible
      posts in the working-class movement until the next Party
      congress.
    
      Refusal to pledge yourselves to either course will make it
      imperative for the Central Committee to consider the question of
      your immediate expulsion from the Party.

Statement to the Bolshevik Group
      at the Extraordinary All-Russia Congress
      of Soviets of Peasants' Deputies[1]


      We demand most emphatically that the Bolsheviks insist, in the
      form of an ultimatum, on an open vote on the question of issuing
      an immediate invitation to several representatives of
      the Government.

    If the reading of this proposal and voting on it
    at the plenary session are refused, the whole Bolshevik group
    should walk out by way of protest.

Speech On The Agrarian Question November 14 (27)
Newspaper Report

      On the instructions of the Bolshevik group, Comrade Lenin
      delivered a speech setting forth the views of the Bolshevik
      Party on the agrarian question.

    
      He said that the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries had suffered
      defeat over the agrarian question, since it had advocated the
      confiscation of the landed estates, but refused to carry it into
      effect.

    
      Landed proprietorship forms the basis of feudal oppression, and
      the confiscation of the landed estates is the first step of the
      revolution in Russia. But the land question cannot be settled
      independently of the other problems of the revolution. A correct
      view of these problems can be derived from an analysis of the
      stages through which the revolution has passed. The first stage
      was the overthrow of the autocracy and the establishment of the
      power of the bourgeoisie and the landowners. The interests of
      the landowners were closely interwoven with those of the
      bourgeoisie and the banks. The second stage was the
      consolidation of the Soviets and a policy of compromise with the
      bourgeoisie. The mistake of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries
      was that at that time they failed to oppose the policy of
      compromise on the plea that the masses were not sufficiently
      enlightened. A party is the vanguard of a class, and its duty is
      to lead the masses and not merely to reflect the average
      political level of the masses. But in order to lead those who
      vacillate the Left Socialist-Revolutionary comrades must
      themselves stop vacillating.

    
      Comrades Left Socialist-Revolutionaries! In July there began a
      period in which the masses of the people started breaking away
      from the policy of compromise, but to this very day the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries are stretching out a hand to the
      Avksentyevs, while offering the workers only their little
      finger. If compromise continues, the revolution is doomed. Only
      if the peasantry supports the workers can the problems of the
      revolution be solved. Compromise is an attempt on the part of
      the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers to get their needs
      satisfied by means of reforms, by concessions on the part of
      capital, without a socialist revolution. But it is impossible to
      give the people peace and land without overthrowing the
      bourgeoisie, without socialism. It is the duty of the revolution
      to put an end to compromise, and to put an end to compromise
      means taking the path of socialist revolution.

    
      Comrade Lenin went on to defend the instructions to the
      volost committees[2] and spoke of the necessity of breaking
      with the leading organs, such as the army committees, the
      Executive Committee of the Peasants' Deputies, etc. We adopted
      our law on the volost committees, he said, from the
      peasants. The peasants want land and the prohibition of hired
      labour; they want implements for the cultivation of the
      soil. And this cannot be obtained without defeating capital. You
      want land, we said to them, but the land is mortgaged and
      belongs to Russian and world capital. You are throwing down a
      challenge to capital, you are following a different path from
      ours; but we are at one with you in that we are marching, and
      must march, towards the social revolution. As for the
      Constituent Assembly, the speaker said that its work will depend
      on the mood in the country, but he added, trust in the mood, but
      don't forget your rifles.
    
      Comrade Lenin went on to deal with the question of the war. When
      he referred to the removal of Dukhonin and the appointment of
      Krylenko as Commander-in-Chief, there was laughter among the
      audience. It may be funny to you, he retorted, but the soldiers
      will condemn you for this laughter. If there are people here who
      think it funny that we removed a counter-revolutionary general
      and appointed Krylenko, who is against the general and has gone
      to conduct negotiations,[3]  we have nothing to say to them. We have
      nothing in common with those who do not recognise the need to
      fight the counter-revolutionary generals. Rather than have
      anything to do with such people we prefer to retire from power,
      go underground if necessary.

Draft Resolution

      The Peasants' Congress fully and in every way supports the law
      (decree) on land of October 26, 1917, approved by the Second
      All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'
      Deputies and published by the Council of People's Commissars as
      the provisional workers' and peasants' government of the Russian
      Republic. The Peasants' Congress declares its firm and
      unshakable resolve to ensure the implementation of this law,
      calls upon all peasants to support it unanimously and to carry
      it out themselves in the localities without delay, and also to
      elect to all and every responsible post and office only people
      who have proved not in word but in deed their complete devotion
      to the interests of the working and exploited peasants, their
      readiness and ability to uphold these interests against any
      resistance the landowners, capitalists, and their supporters or
      accomplices may offer.
    
      The Peasants' Congress also expresses its conviction that the
      full implementation of all the measures constituting the law on
      land is possible only if the workers' socialist revolution which
      began on October 25 is successful, for only the socialist
      revolution can ensure the transfer of the land to the working
      peasantry without compensation, the confiscation of the
      landowners' implements, full protection of the interests of
      agricultural wage-workers and the immediate commencement of the
      unconditional abolition of the entire system of capitalist
      wage-slavery, the proper and planned distribution of the
      products of both agriculture and industry among the various
      regions and the population of the country, control over the
      banks (without such control the people will not be masters of
      the land even though private property in land is abolished),
      all-round state assistance specifically to the working and
      exploited people, etc.
    
      Therefore the Peasants' Congress, fully supporting the
      Revolution of October 25, and supporting it precisely as a
      socialist revolution, declares its unswerving resolve to carry
      out, with due gradualness but without the slightest vacillation,
      measures aimed at the socialist transformation of the Russian
      Republic.
    
      A necessary condition for the victory of the socialist
      revolution, which alone can secure the lasting triumph and full
      implementation of the law on land, is the close alliance of the
      working and exploited peasantry with the working class—the
      proletariat—in all the advanced countries. In the Russian
      Republic the entire organisation and administration of the state
      from top to bottom must henceforth be based on such an
      alliance. Rejecting all and every attempt, direct and indirect,
      overt and covert, to return to a course that experience has
      rejected, to the course of conciliation with the bourgeoisie and
      the champions of bourgeois policy, this alliance alone can
      ensure the victory of socialism the world over.

Speech In Connection With The Statement
      Of A Vikzhel Spokesman
November 18 (December 1)
Newspaper Report

      Comrades, the Vikzhel statement is undoubtedly nothing but a
      misunderstanding. Can you imagine, for one moment, that troops,
      fully aware of their revolutionary duty and fighting for the
      people's interests, would approach Field Headquarters and begin
      smashing up everything and everyone, without making known their
      demands, without so much as explaining to the soldiers around
      II.Q. why they had come. You must realise, comrades, that that
      is impossible. A revolutionary army, conscious of what it is
      about, must make its demands known to those to whom it
      applies. When the demands were being made, much more was done;
      care was taken to make it quite clear that resistance meant
      resisting the people's will, that this was not a common but a
      moral crime against the people's freedom, interests and highest
      aspirations. A revolutionary army never fires the first shot,
      and acts in anger only against invaders and tyrants. Had it been
      otherwise, the word revolution would have lost its meaning. I
      feel I must draw your attention to the fact that while making
      its unverified charges, Vikzhel announces its "neutrality". That
      is something Vikzhel has no right to do. At. a time of
      revolutionary struggle, when every minute counts, when dissent
      and neutrality allow the enemy to put in his word, when he will
      certainly be heard, and when no haste is made to help the people
      in their struggle for their sacred rights. I cannot call such a
      stand neutrality; it is not neutrality; a revolutionary would
      call it incitement. (Applause.) By taking Such a stand you
      incite the generals to action; when you fail to support us, you
      oppose the people.

    
      To postpone the armistice is just what General Dukhonin
      wants. By assisting him you are sabotaging the armistice. Think
      of the grave responsibility that falls upon you, and consider
      what the people will say.
    
      Comrade Lenin went on to say that the telegraph services were
      being sabotaged in some areas. The government was left without
      information, while its opponents circulated absurd rumours. Take
      the allegation that the Polish battalions were opposing the
      government, although the Poles had repeatedly declared that they
      had not interfered and did not intend to interfere in Russian
      affairs; they have also informed us that they want an
      armistice.

Concluding Speech On The Agrarian Question
November 18 (December 1)Newspaper Report

      Comrade Lenin first showed that the accusation of anarchism made
      against the Bolsheviks by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries had
      not been proved.

    
      In what way did socialists differ from anarchists? The
      anarchists did not recognise state power whereas the socialists,
      the Bolsheviks among them, did recognise it in the period of
      transition between the state of affairs then obtaining and the
      socialism towards which they were progressing.

    
      The Bolsheviks favoured a strong authority, but it must be a
      workers' and peasants' authority.
    
      All state power is compulsion, but until then it had always been
      the power of the minority, the power of the landowner and
      capitalist employed against the worker and peasant.
    
      He said that the Bolsheviks stood for the state power that would
      be a firm authority of the majority of the workers and peasants
      employed against the capitalists and landowners.
    
      Comrade Lenin then went on to show that the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries' resolution on the land had called the
      new government a people's socialist government, and dwelt on the
      points that could closely unite the Bolsheviks and Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries.
    
      The alliance of the peasants and workers was a basis for an
      agreement between the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries and the
      Bolsheviks.
    
      It was an honest coalition, an honest alliance, but it would be
      an honest coalition at the summit too, between the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Bolsheviks, if the
      Left Socialist-Revolutionaries were more definite in stating
      their conviction that the revolution was a socialist
      revolution. It was a socialist revolution. The abolition of
      private property in land, the introduction of workers' control,
      the nationalisation of the banks—all these were measures
      that would lead to socialism. They were not socialism, but they
      were measures that would lead to socialism by gigantic
      strides. The Bolsheviks did not promise the workers and peasants
      milk and honey immediately, but they did say that a close
      alliance between the workers and the exploited peasantry, a
      firm, unwavering struggle for the power of the Soviets would
      lead to socialism, and any party that really wanted to be a
      people's party would have to state clearly and decisively that
      the revolution was a socialist revolution.
    
      And only in the event of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries
      stating that clearly and unambiguously would the Bolsheviks'
      alliance with them grow and become stronger.
    
      It had been said that the Bolsheviks were against the
      socialisation of the land and could not, therefore, come to an
      agreement with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries.
    
      The Bolsheviks answered that they were indeed against the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries' socialisation of the land but that
      did not prevent an honest alliance with them.
    
      Today or tomorrow the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries would
      nominate their Minister of Agriculture, and the Bolsheviks would
      not vote against a law on the socialisation of the land if he
      proposed it; they would abstain from voting.
    
      In conclusion Comrade Lenin stressed that only an alliance of
      workers and peasants could acquire land and make peace.
    
      Among other things Comrade Lenin was asked what the Bolsheviks
      would do in the Constituent Assembly if the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries were there in a minority and proposed
      a bill on the socialisation of the land—would the
      Bolsheviks abstain from voting? Of course not. The Bolsheviks
      would vote for the bill hut would make the proviso that they
      were voting for it in order to support the peasants against
      their enemies.

      objections to the Bolshevik demand that Lenin should be invited
      to speak at the Congress in his capacity of Chairman of the
      Council of People's Commissars. They thought this would be
      prejudicial to the issue of power. On their motion, the Congress
      rejected the Bolshevik proposal, and Lenin addressed it as a
      member of the Bolshevik group.

      All-Russia Congiess of Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers'
      Deputies on June 23 (July 6), 1917, and published as a law "On
      the volost Committees" on November 3 (16), 1917.

    

[3]
      The reference is to the start of the peace talks with Germany.
      Following the publication of the Decree on Peace, adopted by the
      Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets, the Soviet Government
      took practical steps to conclude a general democratic peace
      among the belligerents. On November 7 (20), 1917, it issued
      special directions to General Dukhonin, the Commander-in-Chief,
      ordering him to make an offer to the enemy command to stop
      military operations and open peace talks. The directions said
      the government deemed it necessary to make a formal proposal for
      an armistice between the belligerents without delay
      (Izvestia No. 221, November 10, 1917). But the
      counter-revolutionary top brass, who had contacts with the
      military in missions of the Entente, blocked the armistice in
      every possible way. On November 8 (21), the People's
      Commissariat for Foreign Affairs sent a note to the Allied
      ambassadors proposing an immediate cease-fire on all fronts and
      negotiations on peace. The Entente ambassadors met at the
      U.S. Embassy in Petrograd on November 9 (22) arid decided to
      ignore the Soviet government's note.
    

      The refusal of the Entente imperialists to support the Soviet
      Government's peace initiative and their active resistance to the
      conclusion of a peace, forced the Council of People's Commissars
      to start separate peace talks with Germany. On November 14 (27),
      word was received that the German High Command was prepared to
      start armistice talks. On the Soviet Government's proposal the
      talks postponed for five days to give the Allied Government
      another chance to make known their attitude on the peace
      proposal. On November 15 (28), the Soviet Government issued its
      appeal to the governments and peoples of all the belligerent
      countries urging them to join in the peace negotiations. There
      was no reply from the Allied powers.
    

      On November 19 (December 2), a Soviet peace delegation led by
      A. A. Joffe arrived in the neutral zone and proceeded to
      Best-Litovsk, where it met a delegation of the Austin-Hungarian
      bloc which included representatives of Bulgaria amid Turkey. A
      10-day cease-fire was arranged as a result of the talks of
      November 20-22 (December 3-5). The Soviet Government took the
      opportunity to try to turn the separate talks with Germany into
      negotiations for a general democratic peace. On November 24
      (December 7) it sent another note to the Entente ambassadors
      inviting them to join in the talks. This note was also
      ignored. On December 2 (15), the talks were resumed and that
      same day a 28-day cease-fire was agreed upon. It provided for a
      peace conference, which opened at Brest-Litovsk on December 9
      (22).

      A letter to Pravda
    

      Today, Saturday, November 18, in the course of a speech I made
      at the Peasants' Congress, I was publicly asked a question to
      which I forthwith replied.  It is essential that this question
      and my reply should immediately be made known to all the reading
      public, for while formally speaking only in my own name, I was
      actually speaking in the name of the whole Bolshevik Party.
    
The matter was the following.
    
Touching on the question of an alliance between the Bolshevik
      workers and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, whom many
      peasants at present trust, I argued in my speech that this
      alliance can be an "honest coalition", an honest
      alliance, for there is no radical divergence of
      interests between the wage-workers and the working and exploited
      peasants.  Socialism is fully able to meet the
      interests of both. Only socialism can meet their
      interests. Hence the possibility and necessity for an "honest
      coalition" between the proletarians and the working and
      exploited peasantry. On the contrary, a "coalition" (alliance)
      between the working and exploited classes, on the one hand, and
      the bourgeoisie, on the other, cannot be an "honest
      coalition" because of the radical divergence of interests
      between these classes.
    
Imagine, I said, that there is a majority of Bolsheviks and a
      minority of Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in the government, or
      even, let us assume, only one Left Socialist-Revolutionary--the
      Commissar of Agriculture. Could the Bolsheviks practise an
      honest coalition under such circumstances?
    
They could; for, while they are irreconcilable in their fight
      against the counter-revolutionary elements (including the Right
      Socialist-Revolutionary and the defencist elements), the
      Bolsheviks would be obliged to abstain from voting on
      questions which concern purely Socialist-Revolutionary points in
      the land programme approved by the Second All-Russia Congress of
      Soviets.  Such, for instance, would be the point on equal land
      tenure and the redistribution of land among the small holders.
    
By abstaining from voting on such a point the Bolsheviks would not be
      changing their programme in the slightest.
      For, given the victory of socialism (workers' control over the
      factories, to be followed by their expropriation, the
      nationalisation of the banks, and the creation of a Supreme
      Economic Council for the regulation of the entire economic life
      of the country)--given that the workers would be obliged to
      agree to the transitional measures proposed by the small
      working and exploited peasants, provided such measures were
      not detrimental to the cause of socialism. Even
      Kautsky, when he was still a Marxist (1899-l909), frequently
      admitted--l said --that the measures of transition to socialism
      cannot be identical in countries with large-scale and those with
      small-scale farming.
    
We Bolsheviks would be obliged to abstain from voting when such
      a point was being decided in the Council of People's Commissars
      or in the Central Executive Committee, for if the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries (as well as the peasants who support
      them) agreed to workers' control, to the nationalisation of the
      banks, etc., equal land tenure would be only one of the measures
      of transition to full socialism. For the proletariat to
      impose such transitional measures would be absurd; it
      is obliged, in the interests of the victory of socialism, to
      yield to the small working and exploited peasants in
      the choice of these transitional measures, for they could do
      no harm to the cause of socialism.
    
Thereupon, a Left Socialist-Revolutionary (it was Comrade Feofilaktov,
      if I am not mistaken) asked me the following question:
    

      "How would the Bolsheviks act if in the Constituent Assembly
      the peasants wanted to pass a law on equal land tenure, while the bourgeoisie
      were opposed to the peasants and the decision depended on the Bolsheviks?"
    

      I replied: under such circumstances, when the cause of socialism
      would be ensured by the introduction of workers' control, the
      nationalisation of the banks, etc., the alliance between the
      workers and the working and exploited peasants would make it
      obligatory for the party of the proletariat to vote for the
      peasants and against the bourgeoisie. The Bolsheviks, in my
      opinion, would be entitled when the vote was being taken to make
      a declaration of dissent, to place on record their
      non-agreement, etc., but to abstain from voting under such
      circumstances would be to betray their allies in the fight
      for socialism because of a difference with them on a
      partial issue. The Bolsheviks would never betray the peasants in
      such a situation.  Equal land tenure and like measures
      cannot prejudice socialism if the power is in the hands
      of a workers' and peasants' government, if workers' control has
      been introduced, the banks nationalised, a workers' and
      peasants' supreme economic body set up to direct (regulate) the
      entire economic life of the country, and so forth.
    
Such was my reply.

      The Revolution of October 25 had shown the exceptional political
      maturity of the proletariat and its ability to stand firm in
      opposition to the bourgeoisie, said the speaker. The complete
      victory of socialism, however, would require a tremendous
      organisational effort filled with the knowledge that the
      proletariat must become the ruling class.

    
      The proletariat was faced with the tasks of transforming the
      state system on socialist lines, for no matter how easy it would
      be to cite arguments in favour of a middle course such a course
      would be insignificant, the country’s economic situation
      having reached a state that would rule out any middle
      course. There was no place left for half-measures in the
      gigantic struggle against imperialism and capitalism.

    
      The point at issue was—win or lose.

    
      The workers should and did understand this; this was obvious
      because they had rejected half-way, compromise decisions. The
      more profound the revolution, the greater the number of active
      workers required to accomplish the replacement of capitalism by
      a socialist machinery. Even if there were no sabotage, the
      forces of the petty bourgeoisie would be inadequate. The task
      was one that could be accomplished only by drawing on the
      masses, only by the independent activity of the masses. The
      proletariat, therefore, should not think of improving its
      position at the moment, but should think of becoming the ruling
      class. It could not be expected that the rural proletariat would
      be clearly and firmly conscious of its own interests. Only the
      working class could be, and every proletarian, conscious of the
      great prospects, should feel himself to be a leader and carry
      the masses with him.

    
      The proletariat should become the ruling class in the sense of
      being the leader of all who work; it should be the ruling class
      politically.

    
      The illusion that only the bourgeoisie could run the state must
      be fought against. The proletariat must take the rule of the
      state upon itself.

    
      The capitalists were doing everything they could to complicate
      the tasks of the working class. And all working-class
      organisations—trade unions, factory committees and
      others—would have to conduct a determined struggle in the
      economic sphere. The bourgeoisie was spoiling everything,
      sabotaging everything, in order to wreck the working-class
      revolution. And the tasks of organising production devolved
      entirely on the working class. They should do away, once and for
      all, with the illusion that state affairs or the management of
      banks and factories were beyond the power of the workers. All
      this could be solved only by tremendous day-to-day
      organisational work.

    
      It was essential to organise the exchange of products and
      introduce regular accounting and control—these were tasks
      for the working class, and the knowledge necessary for their
      accomplishment had been provided by factory life.

    
      Every factory committee should concern itself not only with the
      affairs of its own factory, but should also be an organisation
      nucleus helping arrange the life of the state as a whole.

    
      It was easy to issue a decree on the abolition of private
      property, but it must and could be implemented only by the
      workers themselves. Let there be mistakes—they would be the
      mistakes of a new class creating a new way of life.

    
      There was not and could not be a definite plan for the
      organisation of economic life.

    
      Nobody could provide one. But it could be done from below, by
      the masses, through their experience. Instructions would, of
      course, be given and ways would be indicated, but it was
      necessary to begin simultaneously from above and from below.

    
      The Soviets would have to become bodies regulating all
      production in Russia, but in order that they should not become
      staff headquarters without troops, work in the lower echelons
      was needed.... [Several illegible words were
      omitted—Editor]

      The working-class masses must set about the organisation of
      control and production on a country-wide scale. Not the
      organisation of individuals, but the organisation of all the
      working people, would be a guarantee of success; if they
      achieved that, if they organised economic life, everything
      opposing them would disappear of its own accord.

      1.The demand for the convocation of a Constituent
      Assembly was a perfectly legitimate part of the programme of
      revolutionary Social-Democracy, because in a bourgeois republic
      the Constituent Assembly represents the highest form of
      democracy and because, in setting up a Pre-parliament, the
      imperialist republic headed by Kerensky was preparing to rig the
      elections and violate democracy in a number of ways.

    
      2.While demanding the convocation of a Constituent
      Assembly, revolutionary Social-Democracy has ever since the
      beginning of the Revolution of 1917 repeatedly emphasised that a
      republic of Soviets is a higher form of democracy than the usual
      bourgeois republic with a Constituent Assembly.
    
      3.For the transition from the bourgeois to the socialist
      system, for the dictatorship of the proletariat, the Republic of
      Soviets (of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’
      Deputies) is not only a higher type of democratic institution
      (as compared with the usual bourgeois republic crowned by a
      Constituent Assembly), but is the only form capable of securing
      the most painless transition to socialism.
    
      4.The convocation of the Constituent Assembly in our
      revolution on the basis of lists submitted in the middle of
      October 1917 is taking place under conditions which preclude the
      possibility of the elections to this Constituent Assembly
      faithfully expressing the will of the people in general and of
      the working people in particular.
    
      5.Firstly, proportional representation results in a
      faithful expression of the will of the people only when the
      party lists correspond to the real division of the people
      according to the party groupings reflected in those lists. In
      our case, however, as is well known, the party which from May to
      October had the largest number of followers among the people,
      and especially among the peasants—the
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party—came out with united election
      lists for the Constituent Assembly in the middle of October
      1917, but split in November 1917, after the elections and before
      the Assembly met.
    
      For this reason, there is not, nor can there be, even a formal
      correspondence between the will of the mass of the electors and
      the composition of the elected Constituent Assembly.
    
      6.Secondly, a still more important, not a formal nor
      legal, but a socio-economic, class source of the discrepancy
      between the will of the people, and especially the will of the
      working classes, on the one hand, and the composition of the
      Constituent Assembly, on the other, is due to the elections to
      the Constituent Assembly having taken place at a time when the
      overwhelming majority of tile people could not yet know the full
      scope and significance of the October, Soviet,
      proletarian-peasant revolution, which began on October 25, 1917,
      i.e., after the lists of candidates for the Constituent Assembly
      had been submitted.
    
      7.The October Revolution is passing through successive
      stages of development before our very eyes, winning power for
      the Soviets and wresting political rule from the bourgeoisie and
      transferring it to the proletariat and poor peasantry.
    
      8.It began with the victory of October 24-25 in the
      capital, when the Second All-Russia Congress of Soviets of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, the vanguard of the
      proletarians and of the most politically active section of the
      peasants, gave a majority to the Bo!shevik Party and put it in
      power.
    
      9.Then, in the course of November and December, the
      revolution spread to the entire army and peasants, this being
      expressed first of all in the deposition of the old leading
      bodies (army committees, gubernia peasant committees,
      the Central Executive Committee of the All-Russia Soviet of
      Peasants’ Deputies, etc.)—which expressed the
      superseded, compromising phase of the revolution, its bourgeois,
      and not proletarian, phase, and which were therefore inevitably
      bound to disappear under the pressure of the deeper and broader
      masses of the people—and in the election of new leading
      bodies in their place.
    
      10.This mighty movement of the exploited people for the
      reconstruction of the leading bodies of their organisations has
      not ended even now, in the middle of December 1917, and the
      Railwaymen’s Congress, which is still in session,
      represents one of its stages.
    
      11.Consequently, the grouping of the class forces in
      Russia in the course of their class struggle is in fact
      assuming, in November and December 1917, a form differing in
      principle from the one that the party lists of candidates for
      the Constituent Assembly compiled in the middle of October 1917
      could have reflected.
    
      12.Recent events in the Ukraine (partly also in Finland
      and Byelorussia, as well as in the Caucasus) point similarly to
      a regrouping of class forces which is taking place in the
      process of the struggle between the bourgeois nationalism of the
      Ukrainian Bada, the Finnish Diet, etc., on the one hand, and
      Soviet power, the proletarian-peasant revolution in each of
      these national republics, on the other.
    
      13.Lastly, the civil war which was started by the
      Cadet-Kaledin counter-revolutionary revolt against the Soviet
      authorities, against the workers’ and peasants’
      government, has finally brought the class struggle to a head and
      has destroyed every chance of setting in a formally democratic
      way the very acute problems with which history has confronted
      the peoples of Russia, and in the first place her working class
      and peasants.
    
      14.Only the complete victory of the workers and peasants
      over the bourgeois and landowner revolt (as expressed in the
      Cadet-Kaledin movement), only the ruthless military suppression
      of this revolt of the slave-owners can really safeguard the
      proletarian-peasant revolution. The course of events and the
      development of the class struggle in the revolution have
      resulted in the slogan "All Power to the Constituent
      Assembly!"—which disregards the gains of the workers’
      and peasants’ revolution, which disregards Soviet power,
      which disregards the decisions of the Second All-Russia Congress
      of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, of the
      Second All-Russia Congress of Peasants’ Deputies,
      etc.—becoming in fact the slogan of the Cadets and
      the Kaledinites and of their helpers. The entire people are now
      fully aware that the Constituent Assembly, if it parted ways
      with Soviet power, would inevitably be doomed to political
      extinction.
    
      15.One of the particularly acute problems of national
      life is the problem of peace. A really revolutionary struggle
      for peace began in Russia only after the victory of the October
      25 Revolution, and the first fruits of this victory were the
      publication of the secret treaties, the conclusion of an
      armistice, and the beginning of open negotiations for a general
      peace without annexations and indemnities.
    
      Only now are the broad sections of the people actually receiving
      a chance fully and openly to observe the policy of revolutionary
      struggle for peace and to study its results.
    
      At the time of the elections to the Constituent Assembly the
      mass of the people had no such chance.
    
      It is clear that the discrepancy between the composition of the
      elected Constituent Assembly and the actual will of the people
      on the question of terminating the war is inevitable from this
      point of view too.
    
      16.The result of all the above-mentioned circumstances
      taken together is that the Constituent Assembly, summoned on the
      basis of the election lists of the parties existing prior to the
      proletarian-peasant revolution under the rule of the
      bourgeoisie, must inevitably clash with the will and interests
      of the working and exploited classes which on October 25 began
      the socialist revolution against the bourgeoisie. Naturally, the
      interests of this revolution stand higher than the formal rights
      of the Constituent Assembly, even if those formal rights were
      not undermined by the absence in the law on the Constituent
      Assembly of a provision recognising the right of the people to
      recall their deputies and hold new elections at any moment.
    
      17.Every direct or indirect attempt to consider the
      question of the Constituent Assembly from a formal, legal point
      of view, within the framework of ordinary bourgeois democracy
      and disregarding the class struggle and civil war, would be a
      betrayal of the proletariat’s cause, and the adoption of
      the bourgeois standpoint. The revolutionary Social-Democrats are
      duty bound to warn all and sundry against this error, into which
      a few Bolshevik leaders, who have been unable to appreciate the
      significance of the October uprising and the tasks of the
      dictatorship of the proletariat, have strayed.
    
      18.The only chance of securing a painless solution to the
      crisis which has arisen owing to the divergence between the
      elections to the Constituent Assembly, on the one hand, and the
      will of the people and the interests of the working and
      exploited classes, on the other, is for the people to exercise
      as broadly and as rapidly as possible the right to elect the
      members of the Constituent Assembly anew, and for the
      Constituent Assembly to accept the law of the Central Executive
      Committee on these new elections, to proclaim that it
      unreservedly recognises Soviet power, the Soviet revolution, and
      its policy on the questions of peace, the land and workers’
      control, and to resolutely join the camp of the enemies of the
      Cadet-Kaledin counter-revolution.
    
      19.Unless these conditions are fulfilled, the crisis in
      connection with the Constituent Assembly can be settled only in
      a revolutionary way, by Soviet power adopting the most
      energetic, speedy, firm and determined revolutionary measures
      against the Cadet-Kaledin counter-revolution, no matter behind
      what slogans and institutions (even participation in the
      Constituent Assembly) this counter-revolution may hide. Any
      attempt to tie the hands of Soviet power in this struggle would
      be tantamount to aiding counterrevolution.

      Two questions now take precedence over all other political
      questions—the question of bread and the question of
      peace. The imperialist war, the war between the biggest and
      richest banking firms, Britain and Germany, that is being waged
      for world domination, the division of the spoils, for the
      plunder of small and weak nations; this horrible, criminal war
      has ruined all countries, exhausted all peoples, and confronted
      mankind with the alternative—either sacrifice all
      civilisation and perish or throw off the capitalist yoke in the
      revolutionary way, do away with the rule of the bourgeoisie and
      win socialism and durable peace.

    
      If socialism is not victorious, peace between the capitalist
      States will be only a truce, an interlude, a time of preparation
      for a fresh slaughter of the peoples. Peace and bread are the
      basic demands of the workers and the exploited. The war has made
      these demands extremely urgent. The war has brought hunger to
      the most civilised countries, to those most culturally
      developed. On the other hand, the war, as a tremendous
      historical process, has accelerated social development to an
      unheard-of degree. Capitalism had developed into imperialism,
      i.e., into monopoly capitalism, and under the influence of the
      war it has become state monopoly capitalism. We have now reached
      the stage of world economy that is the immediate stepping stone
      to socialism.

    
      The socialist revolution that has begun in Russia is, therefore,
      only the beginning of the world socialist revolution. Peace and
      bread, the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, revolutionary means for
      the healing of war wounds, the complete victory of
      socialism—such are the aims of the struggle.

The last speaker tried to intimidate us by asserting that we
    are heading towards an abyss, towards certain destruction. There is,
    however, nothing new for us in this intimidation. Novaya Zhizn,
    the newspaper that expresses the views of the group to which the speaker
    belongs, said before the October days that our revolution wou!d bring
    nothing but disorders and anarchic riots. Talk about our travelling the
    wrong road is, therefore, a reflection of bourgeois psychology that even
    disinterested people cannot get rid of. (Voice from among the
    internalionalists: Demagogy!") No, that is not demagogy, it is your
    constant talk of the axe that is real demagogy.
The measures proposed in the decree are only an effective way of
    ensuring control.
You speak of the intricacy of the machinery, of its fragility and of the
    involved nature of the problem—these are elementary truths that
    everybody is aware of. But if these truths are merely used to put a brake
    on all socialist undertakings, we say that anyone who takes that line is a
    demagogue, and a dangerous demagogue at that.
We want to begin an inventory of the vaults, but the learned specialists
    tell us there is nothing in them but documents and securities. Then what is
    there bad about representatives of the people checking them?
If what they say is true, why do those same learned specialists who
    criticise us not come out with it openly? Whenever the Council makes
    decisions they declare that they agree with us, but only in principle. This
    is the way of the bourgeois intelligentsia, of all conciliators, who ruin
    everything with their constant agreement in principle and disagreement in
    practice.
If you know so much about all these things and have the experience, why
    don't you help us. why do we meet with nothing but sabotage from you in our
    difficult task?
You proceed from a correct scientific theory, but for us theory forms
    the basis of actions to be undertaken, it gives us confidence in those
    actions and does not scare the life out of us. Of course it is difficult to
    make a beginning and we often come up against fragile things; nevertheless
    we have coped with them, are coping with them and shall continue to cope
    with them.
If book-learning were to serve no other purpose than that of hampering
    every new step and instilling eternal fear of the new, it would be
    useless.
Nobody, with the exception of the utopian socialists, has ever asserted
    that victory is possible without resistance, without the dictatorship of
    the proletariat and without seizing the old world in an iron grip.
You accepted this dictatorship in principle, but when that word is
    translated into Russian, called an “iron grip ” and applied in
    practice, you warn us of the fragility and involved nature of the
    matter.
You stubbornly refuse to see that the iron hand that destroys also
    creates. It is an undoubted advantage to us to go over from principles to
    deeds.
To effect control we have called upon the bankers and together with them
    have elaborated measures that they agreed to, so that loans could be
    obtained under full control and properly accounted for. But there are
    people among the bank employees who have the interests of the people at
    heart and who have told us:“They are deceiving you, make haste and
    check their criminal activity that is directly harmful to you“ And we
    did make haste.
We realise that this is an involved measure. None of us, even those who
    are trained economists, will undertake to carry it out. We shall invite the
    specialists who are engaged in that work, but only when we have the keys in
    our own hands. Then we shall even be able to draw advisers from the former
    millionaires. We invite anybody who wants to work as long as he does not
    try to reduce every revolutionary enterprise to mere words; that is
    something we shall not stand for. We use the words "dictatorship of the
    proletariat" in all seriousness and we shall effect that dictatorship.
We wanted to take the line or agreement with the banks, we gave them
    loans to finance factories, but they carried out sabotage on an
    unprecedented scale, and practical experience has forced us to adopt other
    measures of control.
A comrade from the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries has said that in
    principle they would vote for the immediate nationalisation of the banks
    and afterwards work out practical measures in the shortest possible time.
    But he was wrong in that, because our draft does not contain anything but
    principles. The Supreme Economic Council is waiting to discuss them, but if
    the decree is not approved the banks will immediately do everything to
    further disrupt the economy.
The adoption of the decree is urgent, otherwise opposition and sabotage
    will ruin us. (Stormy applause.)
Footnotes
[1] Delivered to the All-Russia Central Executive
    Committee on December 14 (27), 1917, in connection with a discussion of the
    decree nationalising the banks.
Work on practical measures for the nationalisation of the
    banks was started as soon as the socialist revolution won out. The State
    Bank was seized on October 25 (November 7), 1917. Having overcome the
    sabotage of the bourgeois officials, Soviet power soon established
    practical control of the State Bank and set up control over private banks
    as a transitional measure to their nationalisation. However, because of
    sabotage by the bankers, the Soviet Government speeded up the
    nationalisation of private banks. On the morning of December 14 (27), the
    Government ordered workers' detachments and fled Guard units to seize
    all banks and credit institutions in Petrograd. That same day, the
    All-Russia Central Executive Committee adopted decrees “On the
    Nationalisation of the Banks” and “On the Inspection of Steel
    Safes in Banks”.
Both decrees were published in Izvestia No. 252 on December15
    (28).

      The Draft Decree was tabled by Lenin for the approval
      of the Supreme Economic Council in mid-December 1917
 
The critical food
      situation and the threat of famine caused by the profiteering
      and sabotage of the capitalists and officials, as well as by the
      general economic ruin, make it imperative to adopt extraordinary
      revolutionary measures to combat this evil.
    
To enable all citizens of the state, and in the first place all
      the working classes to undertake this struggle under the
      leadership of their Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants'
      Deputies, and normalise the country's economic life immediately
      and comprehensively, stopping at nothing and acting in the most
      revolutionary manner, the following regulations are decreed:
    

      1. All joint-stock companies are proclaimed the property of the
         state.
    

      2. Members of boards and directors of joint-stock companies, as
      well as all shareholders belonging to the wealthy classes (i.e.,
      possessing property to the value of over 5,000 rubles or an
      income exceeding 500 rubles per month), shall be obliged to
      continue to conduct the affairs of these enterprises in good
      order, observing the law on workers' control, presenting all
      shares to the State Bank and submitting to the local Soviets of
      Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies weekly reports on
      their activities.
    

      3. State loans, foreign and domestic, are annulled
         (abrogated).
    

      4. The interests of small holders of bonds and all kinds of
      shares, i.e., holders belonging to the working classes of the
      population, shall be fully guaranteed.
    

      5. Universal labour conscription is introduced. All citizens of
      both sexes between the ages of sixteen and fifty-five shall be
      obliged to perform work assigned to them by the local Soviets of
      Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies, or by other bodies
      of Soviet power.
    

      6. As a first step towards the introduction of universal labour
      conscription, it is decreed that members of the wealthy classes
      (see point 2) shall be obliged to keep, and have entries
      properly made in, consumer-worker books, or worker budget books,
      which must be presented to the appropriate workers'
      organisations or to the local Soviets and their bodies for
      weekly recording of the performance of work undertaken by
      each.
    

      7. For the purpose of proper accounting and distribution of food
      and other necessities, every citizen of the state shall be
      obliged to join a consumers' society. The food boards,
      committees of supplies and other similar organisations, as well
      as the railway and transport unions, shall, under the direction
      of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies,
      establish supervision to ensure the observance of the present
      law. Members of the wealthy classes, in particular, shall be
      obliged to perform the work to be assigned to them by the
      Soviets in the sphere of organising and conducting the affairs
      of the consumers' societies.
    

      8. The railway workers' and employees' unions shall he obliged
      urgently to draw up and immediately begin to carry into effect
      emergency measures for the better organisation of transport,
      particularly as regards the delivery of food, fuel and other
      prime necessities, and shall be guided in the first place by the
      instructions and orders of the Soviets of Workers', Soldiers'
      and Peasants' Deputies and then of the bodies authorised by the
      latter, and of the Supreme Economic Council.
    
Similarly, the railway unions, working in
      conjunction with the local Soviets, shall be responsible for
      most vigorously combating speculation in food and mercilessly
      suppressing all profiteering, not hesitating to adopt
      revolutionary measures.
    

      9. Workers' organisations, unions of office employees and local
      Soviets shall be obliged immediately to set about switching
      enterprises which are closing down or are to be demobilised, and
      also unemployed workers to useful work and the production of
      necessities, and to search for orders, raw materials and
      fuel. While under no circumstances postponing either this work
      or the beginning of the exchange of farm produce for industrial
      goods pending receipt of special instructions from higher
      bodies, the local unions and Soviets shall be strictly guided by
      the orders and instructions of the Supreme Economic Council.
    

      10. Members of the wealthy classes shall be obliged to keep all
      their monetary possessions in the State Bank and its branches,
      or in the savings-banks, and shall be entitled to withdraw not
      more than 100-l25 rubles a week (as shall be established by the
      local Soviets) for living expenses; withdrawals for the needs of
      production and trade shall be made only on presentation of
      written certificates of the organs of workers' control.
    
To supervise the due observance of the present
      law, regulations will be introduced providing for the exchange
      of existing currency notes for new currency notes. All the
      property of persons guilty of deceiving the state and the people
      shall be confiscated.
    

      11. All offenders against the present law, saboteurs and
      government officials who go on strike, as well as profiteers,
      shall be liable to a similar penalty, and also to imprisonment,
      dispatch to the front, or hard labour. The local Soviets and
      bodies under their jurisdiction shall urgently decide upon the
      most revolutionary measures to combat these real enemies of the
      people.
    

      12. The trade unions and other organisations of the working
      people, in conjunction with the local Soviets, and with the
      collaboration of the most reliable persons recommended by Party
      and other organisations, shall form mobile groups of inspectors
      to supervise the implementation of the present law, to verify
      the quantity and quality of work performed and to bring to trial
      before the revolutionary courts persons guilty of violating or
      evading the law.
    
The workers and office employees of the nationalised
      enterprises must exert every effort and adopt extraordinary
      measures to improve the organisation of the work, strengthen
      discipline and raise the productivity of labour. The organs of
      workers' control are to present to the Supreme Economic Council
      weekly reports on the results achieved in this respect.  Those
      found guilty of shortcomings and neglect are to be brought
      before revolutionary courts. [The last
      paragraph comes from the magazine and was published for the
      first time in Collected Works.]

How to Organise Competition?

How to Organise Competition?

    404-15

Bourgeois authors have been using
    up reams of paper praising competition, private enterprise, and all the
    other magnificent virtues and blessings of the capitalists and the
    capitalist system. Socialists have been accused of refusing to understand
    the importance of these virtues, and of ignoring "human nature". As a
    matter of fact, however, capitalism long ago replaced small, independent
    commodity production, under which competition could develop enterprise,
    energy and bold initiative to any considerable extent, by large-
    and very large-scale factory production, joint-stock companies, syndicates
    and other monopolies. Under such capitalism, competition means the
    incredibly brutal suppression of the enterprise, energy and bold initiative
    of the mass of the population, of its overwhelming majority, of
    ninety-nine out of every hundred toilers; it also means that competition is
    replaced by financial fraud, nepotism, servility on the upper rungs of the
    social ladder.
Far from extinguishing competition, socialism, on the contrary, for the
    first time creates the opportunity for employing it on a really
    wide and on a really mass scale, for actually drawing the
    majority of working people into a field of labour in which they can display
    their abilities, develop the capacities, and reveal those talents, so
    abundant among the people whom capitalism crushed, suppressed and strangled
    in thousands and millions.
Now that a socialist government is in power our task is to organise
    competition.
The hangers-on and spongers on the bourgeoisie described socialism as a
    uniform, routine, monotonous and drab barrack system. The lackeys of the
    money-bags, the lickspittles of the exploiters, the bourgeois intellectual
    gentlemen used socialism as a bogey to "frighten" the people, who, under
    capitalism, were doomed to the penal servitude and the barrack-like
    discipline of arduous, monotonous toil, to a life of dire poverty and
    semi-starvation. The first step towards the emancipation of the people from
    this penal servitude is the confiscation of the landed estates, the
    introduction of workers’ control and the nationalisation of the banks. The
    next steps will be the nationalisation of the factories, the compulsory
    organisation of the whole population in consumers’ societies, which are at
    the same time societies for the sale of products, and the state monopoly of
    the trade in grain and other necessities.




Only now is the opportunity created for the truly mass display of
    enterprise, competition and bold initiative. Every factory from which the
    capitalist has been ejected, or in which he has at least been curbed by
    genuine workers’ control, every village from which the landowning exploiter
    has been smoked out and his land confiscated has only now become a field in
    which the working man can reveal his talents, unbend his back a little,
    rise to his full height, and feel that he is a human being. For the first
    time after centuries of working for others, of forced labour for the
    exploiter, it has become possible to work for oneself and moreover
    to employ all the achievements of modern technology and culture in one’s
    work.
Of course, this greatest change in human history from working under
    compulsion to working for oneself cannot take place without friction,
    difficulties, conflicts and violence against the inveterate parasites and
    their hangers-on. No worker has any illusions on that score. The workers
    and poor peasants, hardened by dire want and by many long years of slave
    labour for the exploiters, by their countless insults and acts of violence,
    realise that it will take time to break the resistance of those
    exploiters. The workers and peasants are not in the least infected with the
    sentimental illusions of the intellectual gentlemen, of the Novaya
    Zhizn crowd and other slush, who "shouted" themselves hoarse
    "denouncing" the capitalists and "gesticulated" against them, only to burst
    into tears and to behave like whipped puppies when it came to
    deeds, to putting threats into action, to carrying out in practice
    the work of removing the capitalists.
The great change from working under compulsion to working for oneself,
    to labour planned and organised on a gigantic, national (and to a certain
    extent international, world) scale, also requires—in addition to
    "military" measures for the suppression of the exploiters’
    resistance—tremendous organisational, organising effort on the
    part of the proletariat and the poor peasants. The organisational task is
    interwoven to form a single whole with the task of ruthlessly suppressing
    by military methods yesterday’s slave-owners (capitalists) and their packs
    of lackeys—the bourgeois intellectual gentlemen. Yesterday’s
    slave-owners and their "intellectual" stooges say and think, "We have
    always been organisers and chiefs. We have commanded, and we want to
    continue doing so. We shall refuse to obey the ’common people’, the workers
    and peasants. We shall not submit to them. We shall convert knowledge into
    a weapon for the defence of the privileges of the money-bags and of the
    rule of capital over the people."
That is what the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intellectuals say, think,
    and do. From the point of view of self-interest their behaviour is
    comprehensible. The hangers-on and spongers on the feudal landowners, the
    priests, the scribes, the bureaucrats as Gogol depicted them, and the
    "intellectuals" who hated Belinsky, also found it "hard" to part with
    serfdom. But the cause of the exploiters and of their "intellectual"
    menials is hopeless. The workers and peasants are beginning to break down
    their resistance—unfortunately, not yet firmly, resolutely and
    ruthlessly enough—and break it down they will.
"They" think that the "common people", the "common" workers and poor
    peasants, will be unable to cope with the great, truly heroic, in the
    world-historic sense of the word, organisational tasks which the socialist
    revolution has imposed upon the working people. The intellectuals who are
    accustomed to serving the capitalists and the capitalist state say in order
    to console themselves: "You cannot do without us." But their insolent
    assumption has no truth in it; educated men are already making their
    appearance on the side of the people, on the side of the working people,
    and are helping to break the resistance of the servants of capital. There
    are a great many talented organisers among the peasants and the working
    class, and they are only just beginning to become aware of themselves, to
    awaken, to stretch out towards great, vital, creative work, to tackle with
    their own forces the task of building socialist society.
One of the most important tasks today, if not the most important, is to
    develop this independent initiative of the workers, and of all the working
    and exploited people generally, develop it as widely as possible in
    creative organisational work. At all costs we must break the old,
    absurd, savage, despicable and disgusting prejudice that only the
    so-called "upper classes", only the rich, and those who have gone through
    the school of the rich, are capable of administering the state and
    directing the organisational development of socialist society.
This is a prejudice fostered by rotten routine, by petrified views,
    slavish habits, and still more by the sordid selfishness of the
    capitalists, in whose interest it is to administer while plundering and to
    plunder while administering. The workers will not forget for a moment that
    they need the power of knowledge. The extraordinary striving after
    knowledge which the workers reveal, particularly now, shows that mistaken
    ideas about this do not and cannot exist among the proletariat. But every
    rank-and-file worker and peasant who can read and write, who can
    judge people and has practical experience, is capable of
    organisational work. Among the "common people", of whom the
    bourgeois intellectuals speak with such haughtiness and contempt, there are
    many such men and women. This sort of talent among the working
    class and the peasants is a rich and still untapped source.
The workers and peasants are still "timid", they have not yet become
    accustomed to the idea that they are now the ruling
    class; they are not yet resolute enough. The revolution could not at
    one stroke instill these qualities into millions and millions of
    people who all their lives had been compelled by want and hunger to work
    under the threat of the stick. But the Revolution of October 1917 is
    strong, viable and invincible because it awakens these qualities,
    breaks down the old impediments, removes the worn-out shackles, and leads
    the working people on to the road of the independent creation of a
    new life.
Accounting and control--this is the main economic task of every
    Soviet of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasant’ Deputies, of every consumers’
    society, of every union or committee of supplies, of every factory
    committee or organ of workers’ control in general.
We must fight against the old habit of regarding the measure of labour
    and the means of production from the point of view of the slave whose sole
    aim is to lighten the burden of labour or to obtain at least some little
    bit from the bourgeoisie. The advanced, class-conscious workers
    have already started this fight, and they are offering determined
    resistance to the newcomers who flocked to the factory world in
    particularly large numbers during the war and who now would like to treat
    the people’s factory, the factory that has come into the
    possession of the people, in the old way, with the sole aim of "snatching
    the biggest possible piece of the pie and clearing out". All the
    class-conscious, honest and thinking peasants and working people will take
    their place in this fight by the side of the advanced workers.
Accounting and control, if carried on by the Soviets of
    Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies as the supreme state power, or
    on the instructions, on the authority, of this power --
    widespread, general, universal accounting and control, the accounting and
    control of the amount of labour performed and of the distribution of
    products—is the essence of socialist transformation, once the
    political rule of the proletariat has been established and secured.
The accounting and control essential for the transition to socialism can
    be exercised only by the people. Only the voluntary and conscientious
    co-operation of the mass of the workers and peasants in accounting
    and controlling the rich, the rogues, the idlers and the rowdies,
    a co-operation marked by revolutionary enthusiasm, can conquer these
    survivals of accursed capitalist society, these dregs of humanity, these
    hopelessly decayed and atrophied limbs, this contagion, this plague, this
    ulcer that socialism has inherited from capitalism.
Workers and peasants, working and exploited people! The land, the banks
    and the factories have now become the property of the entire people! You
    yourselves must set to work to take account of and control the
    production and distribution of products—this, and this alone is
    the road to the victory of socialism, the only guarantee of its victory,
    the guarantee of victory over all exploitation, over all poverty and want!
    For there is enough bread, iron, timber, wool, cotton and flax in Russia to
    satisfy the needs of everyone, if only labour and its products are properly
    distributed, if only a business-like, practical control over this
    distribution by the entire people is established, provided only we can
    defeat the enemies of the people: the rich and their hangers-on, and the
    rogues, the idlers and the rowdies, not only in politics, but also
    in everyday economic life.
No mercy for these enemies of the people, the enemies of socialism, the
    enemies of the working people! War to the death against the rich and their
    hangers-on, the bourgeois intellectuals; war on the rogues, the idlers and
    the rowdies! All of them are of the same brood—the spawn of capitalism,
    the offspring of aristocratic and bourgeois society; the society in which a
    handful of men robbed and insulted the people; the society in which poverty
    and want forced thousands and thousands on to the path of rowdyism,
    corruption and roguery, and caused them to lose all human semblance; the
    society which inevitably cultivated in the working man the desire to escape
    exploitation even by means of deception, to wriggle out of it, to escape,
    if only for a moment, from loathsome labour, to procure at least a crust of
    bread by any possible means, at any cost, so as not to starve, so as to
    subdue the pangs of hunger suffered by himself and by his near ones.
The rich and the rogues are two sides of the same coin, they are the two
    principal categories of parasites which capitalism fostered; they
    are the principal enemies of socialism. These enemies must be placed under
    the special surveillance of the entire people; they must be ruthlessly
    punished for the slightest violation of the laws and regulations of
    socialist society. Any display of weakness, hesitation or sentimentality in
    this respect would be an immense crime against socialism.
In order to render these parasites harmless to socialist society we must
    organise the accounting and control of the amount of work done and of
    production and distribution by the entire people, by millions and millions
    of workers and peasants, participating voluntarily, energetically and with
    revolutionary enthusiasm. And in order to organise this accounting and
    control, which is fully within the ability of every honest,
    intelligent and efficient worker and peasant, we must rouse their
    organising talent, the talent that is to be found in their midst; we must
    rouse among them—and organise on a national scale --
    competition in the sphere of organisational achievement; the
    workers and peasants must be brought to see clearly the difference between
    the necessary advice of an educated man and the necessary control by the
    "common" worker and peasant of the slovenliness that is so usual
    among the "educated".
This slovenliness, this carelessness, untidiness, unpunctuality, nervous
    haste, the inclination to substitute discussion for action, talk for work,
    the inclination to undertake everything under the sun without finishing
    anything, are characteristics of the "educated"; and this is not due to the
    fact that they are bad by nature, still less is it due to their evil will;
    it is due to all their habits of life, the conditions of their work, to
    fatigue, to the abnormal separation of mental from manual labor, and so on,
    and so forth.
Among the mistakes, shortcomings and defects of our revolution a by no
    means unimportant place is occupied by the mistakes, etc., which are due to
    these deplorable—but at present inevitable—characteristics of the
    intellectuals in our midst, and to the lack of sufficient
    supervision by the workers over the organisational work
    of the intellectuals.
The workers and peasants are still "timid"; they must get rid of this
    timidity, and they certainty will get rid of it. We cannot
    dispense with the advice, the instruction of educated people, of
    intellectuals and specialists. Every sensible worker and peasant
    understands this perfectly well, and the intellectuals in our midst cannot
    complain of a lack of attention and comradely respect on the part of the
    workers and peasants. Advice and instruction, however, is one thing, and
    the organisation of practical accounting and control is another.
    Very often the intellectuals give excellent advice and instruction, but
    they prove to be ridiculously, absurdly, shamefully "unhandy" and
    incapable of carrying out this advice and instruction, of
    exercising practical control over the translation of words into
    deeds.
In this very respect it is utterly impossible to dispense with the help
    and the leading role of the practical organisers from among the
    "people", from among the factory workers and working peasants. "It is not
    the gods who make pots"—this is the truth that the workers and peasants
    should get well drilled into their minds. They must understand that the
    whole thing now is practical work; that the historical moment has
    arrived when theory is being transformed into practice, vitalised by
    practice, corrected by practice, tested by practice; when the words of
    Marx, "Every step of real movement is more important than a dozen
    programmes", become particularly true—every step in really curbing in
    practice, restricting, fully registering the rich and the rogues and
    keeping them under control is worth more than a dozen excellent arguments
    about socialism. For, "theory, my friend, is grey, but green is the eternal
    tree of life".
Competition must be arranged between practical organisers from among the
    workers and peasants. Every attempt to establish stereotyped forms and to
    impose uniformity from above, as intellectuals are so inclined to do, must
    be combated. Stereotyped forms and uniformity imposed from above have
    nothing in common with democratic and socialist centralism. The unity of
    essentials, of fundamentals, of the substance, is not disturbed but ensured
    by variety in details, in specific local features, in methods of
    approach, in methods of exercising control, in
    ways of exterminating and rendering harmless the parasites (the
    rich and the rogues, slovenly and hysterical intellectuals, etc.,
    etc.).
The Paris Commune gave a great example of how to combine initiative,
    independence, freedom of action and vigour from below with voluntary
    centralism free from stereotyped forms. Our Soviets are following the same
    road. But they are still "timid"; they have not yet got into their stride,
    have not yet "bitten into" their new, great, creative task of building the
    socialist system. The Soviets must set to work more boldly and display
    greater initiative. All "communes"—factories, villages, consumers’
    societies, and committees of supplies—must compete with each
    other as practical organisers of accounting and control of labour and
    distribution of products. The programme of this accounting and control is
    simple, clear and intelligible to all—everyone to have bread; everyone
    to have sound footwear and good clothing; everyone to have warm dwellings;
    everyone to work conscientiously; not a single rogue (including those who
    shirk their work) to be allowed to be at liberty, but kept in prison, or
    serve his sentence of compulsory labour of the hardest kind; not a single
    rich man who violates the laws and regulations of socialism to be allowed
    to escape the fate of the rogue, which should, in justice, be the fate of
    the rich man. "He who does not work, neither shall he eat"—this is the
    practical commandment of socialism. This is how things should be
    organised practically. These are the practical successes
    our "communes" and our worker and peasant organisers should be proud of.
    And this applies particularly to the organisers among the intellectuals
    (particularly, because they are too much, far too much in
    the habit of being proud of their general instructions and
    resolutions).
Thousands of practical forms and methods of accounting and controlling
    the rich, the rogues and the idlers must be devised and put to a practical
    test by the communes themselves, by small units in town and country.
    Variety is a guarantee of effectiveness here, a pledge of success in
    achieving the single common aim—to clean the land of Russia of
    all vermin, of fleas—the rogues, of bugs—the rich, and so on and so
    forth. In one place half a score of rich, a dozen rogues, half a dozen
    workers who shirk their work (in the manner of rowdies, the manner in which
    many compositors in Petrograd, particularly in the Party printing-shops,
    shirk their work) will be put in prison. In another place they will be put
    to cleaning latrines. In a third place they will be provided with "yellow
    tickets" after they have served their time, so that everyone shall keep an
    eye on them, as harmful persons, until they reform. In a fourth
    place, one out of every ten idlers will be shot on the spot. In a fifth
    place mixed methods may be adopted, and by probational release, for
    example, the rich, the bourgeois intellectuals, the rogues and rowdies who
    are corrigible will be given an opportunity to reform quickly. The more
    variety there will be, the better and richer will be our general
    experience, the more certain and rapid will be the success of socialism,
    and the easier will it be for practice to devise—for only practice can
    devise—the best methods and means of struggle.
In what commune, in what district of a large town, in what factory and
    in what village are there no starving people, no
    unemployed, no idle rich, no despicable lackeys of the
    bourgeoisie, saboteurs who call themselves intellectuals? Where has most
    been done to raise the productivity of labour, to build good new houses for
    the poor, to put the poor in the houses of the rich, to regularly provide a
    bottle of milk for every child of every poor family? It is on these points
    that competition should develop between the communes, communities,
    producer-consumers’ societies and associations, and Soviets of Workers’,
    Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies. This is the work in which talented
    organisers should come to the fore in practice and be
    promoted to work in state administration. There is a great deal of talent
    among the people. It is merely suppressed. It must be given an opportunity
    to display itself. It and it alone, with the support of the
    people, can save Russia and save the cause of socialism.

      The Constituent Assembly resolves:

      I. 1. Russia is hereby proclaimed a Republic of Soviets
      of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’
      Deputies. All power, centrally and locally, is vested in these
      Soviets.

    
      2. The Russian Soviet Republic is established on the
        principle of a free union of free nations, as a federation of
        Soviet national republics.

    
      II. Its fundamental aim being to abolish all exploitation
      of man by man, to completely eliminate the division of society
      into classes, to mercilessly crush the resistance of the
      exploiters, to establish a socialist organisation of society and
      to achieve the victory of socialism in all countries, the
      Constituent Assembly further resolves:

      1. Private ownership of land is hereby abolished. All
        land together with all buildings, farm implements and other
        appurtenances of agricultural production, is proclaimed the
        property of the entire working people.

      2. The Soviet laws on workers’ control and on the
        Supreme Economic Council are hereby confirmed for the purpose
        of guaranteeing the power of the working people over the
        exploiters and as a first step towards the complete conversion
        of the factories, mines, railways, and other means of
        production and transport into the property of the
        workers’ and peasants’ state.

      3. The conversion of all banks into the property of the
        workers’ and peasants’ state is hereby confirmed as
        one of the conditions for the emancipation of the working
        people from the yoke of capital.

      4. For the purpose of abolishing the parasitic sections
        of society, universal labour conscription is hereby
        instituted.

      5. To ensure the sovereign power of the working people,
        and to eliminate all possibility of the restoration of the
        power of the exploiters, the arming of the working people, the
        creation of a socialist Red Army of workers and peasants and
        the complete disarming of the propertied classes are hereby
        decreed.

    
      III. 1. Expressing its firm determination
      to wrest mankind from the clutches of finance capital and
      imperialism, which have in this most criminal of wars drenched the
      world in blood, the Constituent Assembly whole-heartedly endorses
      the policy pursued by Soviet power of denouncing the secret
      treaties, organising most extensive fraternisation with the
      workers and peasants of the armies in the war, and achieving at
      all costs, by revolutionary means, a democratic peace between the
      nations, without annexations and indemnities and on the basis of
      the free self-determination of nations.

      2. With the same end in view, the Constituent Assembly
        insists on a complete break with the barbarous policy of
        bourgeois civilisation, which has built the prosperity of the
        exploiters belonging to a few chosen nations on the
        enslavement of hundreds of millions of working people in Asia,
        in the colonies in general, and in the small countries.

    
      The Constituent Assembly welcomes the policy of the Council of
      People’s Commissars in proclaiming the complete
      independence of Finland, commencing the evacuation of troops
      from Persia, and proclaiming freedom of self-determination for
      Armenia.[2]

      3. The Constituent Assembly regards the Soviet law on the
         cancellation of the loans contracted by the governments of
         the tsar, the landowners and the bourgeoisie as a first blow
         struck at international banking, finance capital, and
         expresses the conviction that Soviet power will firmly pursue
         this path until the international workers’ uprising
         against the yoke of capital has completely triumphed.
    

      IV. Having been elected on the basis of party
      lists drawn up prior to the October Revolution, when the people
      were not yet in a position to rise en masse against the
      exploiters, had not yet experienced the full strength of
      resistance of the latter in defence of their class privileges, and
      had not yet applied themselves in practice to the task of building
      socialist society, the Constituent Assembly considers that it
      would be fundamentally wrong, even formally, to put itself in
      opposition to Soviet power.

    In essence the Constituent Assembly considers that now,
      when the people are waging the last fight against their
      exploiters, there can be no place for exploiters in any government
      body. Power must be vested wholly and entirely in the working
      people and their authorised representatives—the Soviets of
      Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’ Deputies.

    

      Supporting Soviet power and the decrees of the Council of
      People’s Commissars, the Constituent Assembly considers
      that its own task is confined to establishing the fundamental
      principles of the socialist reconstruction of society.

    At the same time, endeavouring to create a really free and
      voluntary, and therefore all the more firm and stable, union of
      the working classes of all the nations of Russia, the Constituent
      Assembly confines its own task to setting up the fundamental
      principles of a federation of Soviet Republics of Russia, while
      leaving it to the workers and peasants of each nation to decide
      independently at their own authoritative Congress of Soviets
      whether they wish to participate in the federal government and in
      the other federal Soviet institutions, and on what terms.

      The draft of the declaration was placed before the All-Russia
      Central Executive Committee on January 3 (16), 1918, and adopted
      as a basis by a majority with two against and one abstention. It
      was referred to a Co-ordinating Commission for final
      drafting. The declaration was adopted by the All-Russia Central
      Executive Committee and published in Izvestia on
      January 4 (17). On behalf of the Committee it was read out by
      Sverdlov at the first sitting of the Constituent Assembly on
      January 5 (18) and motioned for approval. The
      counter-revolutionary majority of the Assembly rejected the
      motion to discuss it. On January 12 (25), it was approved by the
      Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets and subsequently formed the
      basis of the Soviet Constitution.

    
      Paragraph 2 of Lenin’s manuscript was altered by
      Stalin. The paragraph beginning with the words “In essence
      the Constituent Assembly considers...“ was written by
      Bukharin and edited
      by Lenin.

      On December 6 (19), 1917, the Finnish Diet adopted a declaration
      of Finland’s independence. In accordance with the
      nationalities policy of the Soviet state, the Council of Peoples
      Commissars, on December 18 (31), 1917, issued a decree on
      Finland’s independence. At the meeting of the government,
      Lenin personally handed the text of the decree to Prime Minister
      Svinhufvud, who led a Finnish Government delegation. On December
      22, 1917 (January 4, 1918), the decree on Finland’s
      independence was approved by the All-Russia Central Executive
      Committee.

    
      On December 19, 1917 (January 1, 1918), in conformity with a
      treaty concluded between Russia and Germany, Austria-Hungary,
      Turkey and Bulgaria at Brest-Litovsk on December 2 (15), the
      Soviet Government proposed to the Persian Government to
      elaborate a common plan for the withdrawal of Russian troops
      from Persia.

    
      On December 29, 1917 (January 11, 1918), the government issued
      the Decree on Turkish Armenia, which was published in
      Pravda No. 227 on December 31, 1917 (January 13,

      "Friends, I have lost a day," says an old Latin tag. One cannot
      help but recall it when one remembers how the fifth of January
      was lost. 

    
      After real, lively, Soviet work among workers and peasants
      engaged on real tasks, clearing the forest and
      uprooting the stumps of landowner and capitalist exploitation,
      we were suddenly transported to "another world", to arrivals
      from another world, from the camp of the bourgeoisie with its
      willing or unwilling, conscious or unconscious champions, with
      its hangers-on, servants and advocates. Out of the world in
      which the working people and their Soviet organisation were
      conducting the struggle against the exploiters we were
      transported to the world of saccharine phrases, of slick, empty
      declamations, of promises and more promises based, as before, on
      conciliation with the capitalists. 

    
      It is as though history had accidentally, or by mistake, turned
      its clock back, and January 1918 for a single day became May or
      June 1917!  

    
      It was terrible! To be transported from the world of living
      people into the company of corpses, to breathe the odour of the
      dead, to hear those mummies with their empty "social" Louis
      Blanc phrases, to hear Chernov and Tsereteli, was simply
      intolerable. 

    
      Comrade Skvortsov was right when he rapped out to the Right
      Socialist-Revolutionaries these two or three brief phrases,
      simple, calm and at the same time ruthlessly cutting: "Between
      us everything is over. We are carrying the October Revolution
      against the bourgeoisie to its culmination. We and you are on
      different sides of the barricades." 

      
    
      In reply to that came a torrent of over-smooth, empty phrases
      from Chernov and Tsereteli that carefully avoided only (only!)
      one question—that of Soviet power, of the October
      Revolution. "Let there be no civil war, let there be no
      sabotage," said Chernov, invoking the revolution in the name of
      the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. And the latter who for six
      months, from June 1917 to January 1918, had been sleeping like
      corpses in their coffins, stood up and clapped furiously and
      persistently. It is really so easy and so pleasant to settle the
      problems of the revolution by an incantation. "Let there be no
      civil war, let there be no sabotage, let everybody recognise the
      Constituent Assembly." In what way does that differ, in essence,
      from the invocation: "Let the workers and capitalists make
      peace"? Not in any way. The Kaledins and Ryabushinskys together
      with their imperialist friends in all countries will not
      disappear or change their policy because of the invocations of
      the mealy-mouthed Chernov or because of Tsereteli's boring
      precepts that seem to have been taken from a misunderstood,
      poorly read and misinterpreted book. 

    
      Either conquer the Kaledins and Ryabushinskys or give up the
      revolution. Either victory over the exploiters in the civil war,
      or the collapse of the revolution. Such has been the issue in
      all revolutions, in the English revolution in the
      seventeenth century, in the French in the eighteenth century and
      in the German in the nineteenth century. How could it be thought
      that the Russian revolution in the twentieth century would
      not face that issue? How can wolves become lambs? 

    
      Tsereteli and Chernov do not show a grain of an idea, not the
      slightest desire to accept the fact of the class struggle that
      has become civil war, not by chance, not suddenly, not because
      of somebody's caprice or ill will, but inevitably, in the long
      process of revolutionary development. 

    
      It was a hard, boring and irksome day in the elegant rooms of
      the Taurida Palace, whose very aspect differs from that of
      Smolny approximately in the same way as elegant, but moribund
      bourgeois parliamentarism differs from the plain, proletarian
      Soviet apparatus that is in many ways still disorderly and
      imperfect but is living and vital. There, in that old world of
      bourgeois parliamentarism, the leaders of hostile classes and
      hostile groups of the bourgeoisie did their fencing.
      Here, in the new world of the proletarian and peasant, socialist
      state, the oppressed classes are making clumsy,
      inefficient. . . .[manuscript breaks off at

      At its very inception, the Russian revolution produced the
      Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and Peasants’
      Deputies as the only mass organisation of all the working and
      exploited classes capable of leading the struggle of these
      classes for their complete political and economic emancipation.

    
      During the whole of the initial period of the Russian Revolution
      the Soviets multiplied in number, grew and gained strength and
      were taught by their own experience to discard the illusions of
      compromise with the bourgeoisie and to realise the deceptive
      nature of the forms of the bourgeois-democratic parliamentary
      system; they arrived by practical experience at the conclusion
      that the emancipation of the oppressed classes was impossible
      unless they broke with these forms and with every kind of
      compromise. The break came with the October Revolution, which
      transferred the entire power to the Soviets.

    
      The Constituent Assembly, elected on the basis of electoral
      lists drawn up prior to the October Revolution, was an
      expression of the old relation of political forces which existed
      when power was held by the compromisers and the Cadets. When the
      people at that time voted for the candidates of the
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party, they were not in a position to
      choose between the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, the
      supporters of the bourgeoisie, and the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, the supporters of socialism. The
      Constituent Assembly, therefore, which was to have crowned the
      bourgeois parliamentary republic, was bound to become an
      obstacle in the path of the October Revolution and Soviet power.

    
      The October Revolution, by giving power to the Soviets, and
      through the Soviets to the working and exploited classes,
      aroused the desperate resistance of the exploiters, and in the
      crushing of this resistance it fully revealed itself as the
      beginning of the socialist revolution. The working classes
      learned by experience that the old bourgeois parliamentary
      system had outlived its purpose and was absolutely incompatible
      with the aim of achieving socialism, and that not national
      institutions, but only class institutions (such as the Soviets)
      were capable of overcoming the resistance of the propertied
      classes and of laying the foundations of socialist society. To
      relinquish the sovereign power of the Soviets, to relinquish the
      Soviet Republic won by the people, for the sake of the bourgeois
      parliamentary system and the Constituent Assembly, would now be
      a step backwards and would cause the collapse of the October
      workers’ and peasants’ revolution.

    
      Owing to the above-mentioned circumstances, the Party of Right
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, the party of Kerensky, Avksentyev and
      Chernov, obtained the majority in the Constituent Assembly which
      met on January 5. Naturally, this party refused to discuss the
      absolutely clear, precise and unambiguous proposal of the
      supreme organ of Soviet power, the Central Executive Committee
      of the Soviets, to recognise the programme of Soviet power, to
      recognise the Declaration of Rights of the Working and Exploited
      People, to recognise the October Revolution and Soviet power. By
      this action the Constituent Assembly severed all ties with the
      Soviet Republic of Russia. It was inevitable that the Bolshevik
      group and the Left Socialist-Revolutionary group, who now
      patently constitute the overwhelming majority in the Soviets and
      enjoy the confidence of the workers and the majority of the
      peasants, should withdraw from such a Constituent Assembly.

    
      The Right Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik parties are in
      fact carrying on outside the Constituent Assembly a most
      desperate struggle against Soviet power, calling openly in their
      press for its overthrow and describing as arbitrary and unlawful
      the crushing of the resistance of the exploiters by the forces
      of the working classes, which is essential in the interests of
      emancipation from exploitation. They are defending the
      saboteurs, the servants of capital, and are going as far as
      undisguised calls to terrorism, which certain “unidentified
      groups” have already begun. It is obvious that under such
      circumstances the remaining part of the Constituent Assembly
      could only serve as a screen for the struggle of the
      counter-revolutionaries to overthrow Soviet power.

    
      Accordingly, the Central Executive Committee resolves that the
      Constituent Assembly is hereby dissolved.

      It might be argued that this is no time to deal with
      history. Certainly, this kind of assertion would be permissible
      if a particular question from the past were not inseparably and
      directly connected in practice with the present. The question of
      the unfortunate peace, the exceptionally harsh peace is,
      however, such a burning question that it calls for
      elucidation. I am therefore publishing my theses on this subject
      that were read at a meeting of about sixty of the leading
      Petrograd Party functionaries on January 8, 1918. 
    

      Here are these theses: 
    
  January 7, 1918. 
    

      Theses On The Question Of The Immediate Conclusion Of A Separate
      And Annexationist Peace[1]


      1. The position of the Russian revolution at the present moment
      is such that nearly all the workers and the vast majority of the
      peasants undoubtedly side with Soviet power and the socialist
      revolution which it has started. To that extent the socialist
      revolution in Russia is assured. 
    


      2. At the same time, the civil war, provoked by the frantic
      resistance of the wealthy classes, who realise full well that
      they are faced with the last and decisive fight for the
      preservation of private ownership of the land and means of
      production, has not yet reached its climax. The victory of
      Soviet power in this war is assured, but some time must
      inevitably elapse, no little exertion of effort will inevitably
      be required, a certain period of acute economic dislocation and
      chaos, which accompany all wars, and civil war in particular, is
      inevitable, before the resistance of the bourgeoisie is
      crushed. 
    


      3. Furthermore, this resistance, in its less active and
      non-military forms—sabotage, the hire of declassed elements
      and agents of the bourgeoisie, who worm their way into the ranks
      of the socialists in order to ruin their cause, and so on and so
      forth—has proved so stubborn and capable of assuming such
      diversified forms, that the fight against it will inevitably
      require some more time, and, in its main forms, is hardly likely
      to end until several months have passed. And unless this passive
      and covert resistance of the bourgeoisie and its supporters-is
      definitely crushed the socialist revolution cannot succeed. 
    


      4. Lastly, the organisational problems of the socialist
      transformation of Russia are so immense and difficult that their
      solution—in view of the numerous petty-bourgeois
      fellow-travellers of the socialist proletariat, and of the
      latter's low cultural level—will also require a fairly long
      time. 
    


      5. All these circumstances taken together are such as to make it
      perfectly clear that for the success of socialism in Russia a
      certain amount of time, several months at least, will be
      necessary, during which the hands of the socialist government
      must be absolutely free to achieve victory over the bourgeoisie
      first in our own country and to launch far-reaching mass
      organisational work on a wide scale. 
    


      6. The position of the socialist revolution in Russia must form
      the basis of any definition of the international tasks of our
      Soviet power, for the international situation in the fourth year
      of the war is such that it is quite impossible to predict the
      probable moment of outbreak of revolution and overthrow of any
      of the European imperialist governments (including the
      German). That the socialist revolution in Europe must come, and
      will come, is beyond doubt. All our hopes for the final
      victory of socialism are founded on this certainty and on this
      scientific prognosis. Our propaganda activities in general, and
      the organisation of fraternisation in particular, must be
      intensified and extended. It would be a mistake, however, to
      base the tactics of the Russian socialist government on attempts
      to determine whether or not the European, and especially the
      German, socialist revolution will take place in the next six
      months (or some such brief period). Inasmuch as it is quite
      impossible to determine this, all such attempts, objectively
      speaking, would be nothing but a blind gamble. 
    


      7. The peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk have by
      now—January 7, 1918—made it perfectly clear that the
      war party has undoubtedly gained the upper hand in the German
      Government (which has the other governments of the Quadruple
      Alliance at its beck and call) and has virtually already
      presented Russia with an ultimatum (and it is to be expected,
      most certainly to be expected, that any day now it will be
      presented formally). The ultimatum is as follows: either the
      continuation of the war, or a peace with annexations, i.e.,
      peace on condition that we surrender all the territory we have
      occupied, while the Germans retain all the territory
      they have occupied and impose upon us an indemnity (outwardly
      disguised as payment for the maintenance of prisoners)—an
      indemnity of about three thousand million rubles,
      payable over a number of years. 
    


      8. The socialist government of Russia is faced with the
      question—a question whose solution brooks no delay—of
      whether to accept this peace with annexations now, or to
      immediately wage a revolutionary war. In fact, no middle course
      is possible. No further postponement can now be achieved, for we
      have already done everything possible and impossible to
      deliberately protract the negotiations. 
    


      9. On examining the arguments in favour of an immediate
      revolutionary war, the first argument we encounter is that a
      separate peace at this juncture would, objectively speaking, be
      an agreement with the German imperialists, an "imperialistic
      deal", and so forth, and that, consequently, such a peace would
      mean a complete break with the fundamental principles of
      proletarian internationalism. 
      
    


      This argument, however, is obviously incorrect. Workers who lose
      a strike and sign terms for the resumption of work which are
      unfavourable to them and favourable to the capitalists, do not
      betray socialism. The only people who betray socialism are those
      who secure advantages for a section of the workers in exchange
      for profit to the capitalists; only such agreements are
      impermissible in principle.  
      
    


      He betrays
      socialism who calls the war with German imperialism a defensive
      and just war, but actually receives support from the
      Anglo-French imperialists, and conceals secret treaties
      concluded with them from the people. He does not in the least
      betray socialism who, without concealing anything from the
      people, and without concluding any secret treaties with the
      imperialists, agrees to sign terms of peace which are
      unfavourable to the weak nation and favourable to the
      imperialists of one group, if at that moment there is no
      strength to continue the war. 
    


      10. Another argument in favour of immediate war is that, by
      concluding peace, we objectively become agents of German
      imperialism, for we afford it the opportunity to release troops
      from our front, we surrender to it millions of prisoners of war,
      and so on. But this argument too is manifestly incorrect, for a
      revolutionary war at the present juncture would, objectively
      speaking, make us agents of Anglo-French imperialism, by
      providing it with forces which would promote its aims. The
      British bluntly offered our Commander-in-Chief, Krylenko, one
      hundred rubles per month for every one of our soldiers provided
      we continued the war. Even if we did not take a single kopek
      from the Anglo-French, we nevertheless would be helping them,
      objectively speaking, by diverting part of the German army. 
      
    


      From that point of view, in neither case would we be entirely
      escaping some sort of imperialist bond, and it is obvious that
      it is impossible to escape it completely without overthrowing
      world imperialism. The correct conclusion from this is that the
      moment a socialist government triumphed in any one country,
      questions must be decided, not from the point of view of whether
      this or that imperialism is preferable, but exclusively from the
      point of view of the conditions which best make for the
      development and consolidation of the socialist revolution which
      has already begun. 
      
    


      In other words, the underlying principle of our tactics must not be,
      which of the two imperialisms it is more profitable to aid at
      this juncture, but rather, how the socialist revolution can be
      most firmly and reliably ensured the possibility of
      consolidating itself, or, at least, of maintaining itself in one
      country until it is joined by other countries.  
      
    


      11. It is said that the German Social-Democratic opponents of
      the war have now become "defeatists" and are requesting us not
      to yield to German imperialism. But we recognised defeatism only
      in respect of one's own imperialist bourgeoisie, and we
      always discountenanced victory over an alien imperialism,
      victory attained in formal or actual alliance with a "friendly"
      imperialism, as a method impermissible in principle and
      generally wrong. 
    


      This argument is therefore only a modification of the previous
      one. If the German Left Social-Democrats were proposing that we
      delay concluding a separate peace for a definite
      period, and guaranteed revolutionary action in Germany within
      this period, the question might assume a different
      aspect for us. Far from saying this, however, the German Lefts
      formally declare: "Hold out as long as you can, but decide the
      question from the point of view of the state of affairs in the
      Russian socialist revolution, for we cannot promise you
      anything positive regarding the German revolution." 
      
    


      12. It is said that in a number of Party statements we actually
      "promised" a revolutionary war, and that by concluding a
      separate peace we would be going back on our word. 
    


      That is not true. We said that in the era of imperialism a
      socialist government had to "prepare for and wage " a
      revolutionary war; we said this in order to combat abstract
      pacifism and the theory that "defence of the fatherland" must be
      completely rejected in the era of imperialism. and, lastly to
      combat the purely selfish instincts of a part of the soldiers,
      but we never gave any pledge to start a revolutionary war
      without considering whether it is possible to wage it at a given
      moment. 
    


      Unquestionably, even at this juncture we must prepare
      for a revolutionary war. We are carrying out this promise,
      as we have, in general, carried out all our promises that could
      be carried out at once: we annulled the secret treaties, offered
      all peoples a fair peace, and several times did our best to drag
      out peace negotiations so as to give other peoples a chance to
      join us.  
      
    


      But the question whether it is possible to carry on a revolutionary
      war now, immediately, must be decided
      exclusively from the point of view of whether material
      conditions permit it, and of the interests of the socialist
      revolution which has already begun. 
    


      13. Summing up the arguments in favour of an immediate
      revolutionary war, we have to conclude that such a policy might
      perhaps answer the human yearning for the beautiful, dramatic
      and striking, but that it would totally disregard the objective
      balance of class forces and material factors at the present
      stage of the socialist revolution now under way. 
    


      14. There can be no doubt that our army is absolutely in no
      condition at the present moment, and will not be for the next
      few weeks (and probably for the next few months), to beat back a
      German offensive successfully; firstly, owing to the extreme
      fatigue and exhaustion of the majority of the soldiers, coupled
      with the incredible chaos in the matter of food supply,
      replacement of the overfatigued, etc.; secondly, owing to the
      utter unfitness of the horses and the consequent inevitable ruin
      of our artillery; and, thirdly, owing to the absolute
      impossibility of defending the coastline from Riga to Revel,
      which affords the enemy a very certain chance of seizing the
      rest of Lifland, and then Estland, and of outflanking a large
      part of our forces, and finally, of capturing Petrograd. 
    


      15. Further, there is not the slightest doubt that the peasant
      majority of our army would at the present juncture unreservedly
      declare in favour of a peace with annexations and not in favour
      of an immediate revolutionary war; the socialist reorganisation
      of the army, the merging of the Red Guard detachments with it,
      and so on, have only just begun. 
 
    


      With the army completely democratised, to carry on war in
      defiance of the wishes of the majority of the soldiers would be
      a reckless gamble, while to create a really staunch and
      ideologically stable socialist workers' and peasants' army will,
      at the very least, require months and months. 
    


      16. The poor peasants in Russia are capable of supporting the
      socialist revolution led by the working class, but they are not
      capable of agreeing to fight a serious revolutionary war
      immediately, at the present juncture. To ignore the objective
      balance of class forces on this issue would be a fatal error. 
    


      17. Consequently, the situation at present with regard to a
      revolutionary war is as follows: 
    


      If the German revolution were to break out and triumph in the
      coming three or four months, the tactics of an immediate
      revolutionary war might perhaps not ruin our socialist
      revolution. 
    


      If, however, the German revolution does not occur in the next
      few months, the course of events, if the war is continued, will
      inevitably be such that grave defeats will compel Russia to
      conclude an even more disadvantageous separate peace, a peace,
      moreover, which would be concluded, not by a socialist
      government, but by some other (for example, a bloc of the
      bourgeois Rada and Chernov's followers, or something
      similar). For the peasant army, which is exhausted to the limit
      by the war, will after the very first defeats—and very
      likely within a-matter of weeks, and not of
      months—overthrow the socialist workers' government. 
    


      18. This being the state of affairs, it would be absolutely
      impermissible tactics to stake the fate of the socialist
      revolution, which has already begun in Russia, merely on the
      chance that the German revolution may begin in the immediate
      future, within a matter of weeks. Such tactics would be a
      reckless gamble. We have no right to take such risks. 
    


      19. The German revolution will by no means be made more
      difficult of accomplishment as far as its objective premises are
      concerned, if we conclude a separate peace. Probably chauvinist
      intoxication will weaken it for a time, but Germany's position
      will remain extremely grave, the war with Britain and America
      will be a protracted one, and aggressive imperialism will be
      fully and completely exposed on both sides. A socialist Soviet
      Republic in Russia will stand as a living example to the peoples
      of all countries, and the propaganda and revolutionising effect
      of this example will be immense. There—the bourgeois system
      and a fully exposed predatory war between two groups of
      marauders. Here—peace and a socialist Soviet Republic. 
    


      20. In concluding a separate peace we free ourselves as much
as is possible at the present moment from both hostile
      imperialist groups, we take advantage of their mutual enmity and
      warfare which hamper concerted action on their part against us,
      and for a certain period have our hands free to advance and to
      consolidate the socialist revolution. The reorganisation of
      Russia on the basis of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and
      the nationalisation of the banks and large-scale industry,
      coupled with exchange of products in kind between the
      towns and the small-peasant consumers' societies, is quite
      feasible economically, provided we are assured a few months in
      which to work in peace. And such a reorganisation will render
      socialism invincible both in Russia and all over the world, and
      at the same time will create a solid economic basis for a mighty
      workers' and peasants' Red Army. 
    


      21. A really revolutionary war at this juncture would be a war
      waged by a socialist republic against the bourgeois countries,
      with the aim—an aim clearly defined and fully approved by
      the socialist army—of overthrowing the bourgeoisie in other
      countries. However, we obviously cannot set ourselves
      this aim at the present moment. Objectively, we would
      be fighting now for the liberation of Poland, Lifland and
      Courland. But no Marxist, without renouncing the principles of
      Marxism and of socialism generally, can deny that the interests
      of socialism are higher than the interests of the right of
      nations to self-determination. Our socialist republic has done
      all it could, and continues to do all it can to give effect to
      the right to self-determination of Finland, the Ukraine,
      etc. But if the concrete situation is such that the existence of
      the socialist republic is being imperilled at the present moment
      on account of the violation of the right to self-determination
      of several nations (Poland, Lifland, Courland, etc.), naturally
      the preservation of the socialist republic has the higher
      claim. 
    


      Consequently, whoever says, "We cannot sign a humiliating,
      atrocious, etc., peace, betray Poland, and so forth", does not
      realise that by concluding peace on the condition that Poland is
      liberated, he would only be strengthening German imperialism
      against Britain, Belgium, Serbia and other countries still
      further. Peace on the condition of the liberation of
      Poland, Lifland and Courland would be a "patriotic" peace
      from the point of view of Russia, but would by no means
      cease to be a peace with the annexationists, with the
      German imperialists.
    


      January 21, 1918. The following should be
      added to the above theses: 
    

      22. The mass strikes in Austria and Germany, and, subsequently,
      the formation of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies in Berlin and
      Vienna, and, lastly, beginning from January 18-20, armed clashes
      and street fighting in Berlin—all this should be regarded
      as evidence of the fact that the revolution in Germany has
      begun. 
    

      This fact offers us the opportunity, for the time being, of
      further delaying and dragging out the peace negotiations.  
    
Footnotes

[1] A
      discussion of the question of war and peace was held by the
      Central Committee on January 11 (24), 1918, following a speech
      by Lenin, who was opposed by the Left Communists and
      Trotsky. Some of them—Bukharin, Uritsky, Lomov
      (Oppokov)—supported Trotsky's proposal for a "neither war
      nor peace" attitude. Stalin, Sergeyev (Artyom) and Sokolnikov
      favoured peace. The Left Communists did not expect the
      "revolutionary war now" slogan to go through (only two voted for
      it), and so voted for Trotsky's proposal, which received 9 votes
      to 7 against. In the hope of overcoming the resistance to the
      conclusion of peace within the Central Committee and winning
      over the section of the masses which followed the advocates of a
      revolutionary war, Lenin motioned the proposal that the talks
      should be delayed in every possible way, and this was passed by
      12 votes to one.

      I read the above Theses to a small private meeting of Party
      functionaries on January 8, 1918. The discussion on them showed
      three opinions in the Party on this question—about a half
      those present spoke in favour of revolutionary war (this was
      sometimes called the §Moscow¨ point of view because
      the Moscow Regional Bureau of our Party adopted it earlier than
      other organisations); then about a quarter were for Comrade
      Trotsky who proposed to declare the cessation of hostilities,
      demobilise the army, send the soldiers home but refrain from
      signing a treaty¨, and, lastly, about a quarter supported
      me.

    
      The state of affairs now obtaining in the Party reminds me very
      strongly of the situation in the summer of 1907 when the
      overwhelming majority of the Bolslieviks favoured the boycott of
      tile Third Duma and I stood side by side with Dan in favour of
      participation and was subjected to furious attacks for my
      opportunism. Objectively, the present issue is a complete
      analogy; as then, the majority of the Party functionaries,
      proceeding from the very best revolutionary motives and the best
      Party traditions, allow themselves to be carried away by a
      §flash¨ slogan and do not grasp the new
      socio-economic and political situation, do not take into
      consideration the change in the conditions that demands
      a speedy and abrupt change in tactics. The essence of my
      argument, today as then, is to make clear that Marxism demands
      the consideration of objective conditions and their changes,
      that the question must be presented concretely as applicable to
      those conditions, that the most significant change that has
      occurred is the foundation of the Russian Soviet Republic, and
      the preservation of the republic that has already begun the
      socialist revolution is most important to us and to the
      international socialist movement; that at the moment
      the slogan of revolutionary war proclaimed by Russia would
      either be an empty phrase and an unsupported demonstration, or
      would be tantamount, objectively, to falling into the trap set
      for us by the imperialists, who wish to inveigle us into
      continuing the imperialist war while we are still a
      weak unit, so that the young Soviet Republic might be crushed as
      cheaply as possible.

    
      §I stand by Lenin¥s old position,¨ exclaimed one
      young Muscovite (youth is one of the greatest virtues
      distinguishing that group of speakers). And that samespeaker
      reproached me for repeating the old arguments of the defencists
      about the improbability of a revolution in Germany.

    
      The whole trouble is that the Muscovites want to stick to the
      old tactical position, and stubbornly refuse to see the change
      that has taken place, the new objective situation that
      has arisen.

    
      The Muscovites, in their zealous repetition of old slogans, have
      not even taken into consideration the fact that we Bolsheviks
      have now all become defencists. Having overthrown the
      bourgeoisie, having denounced and exposed the secret treaties,
      having proposed peace to all peoples, actually... Here the manuscript breaks off

Report On The Activities Of The Council Of People’s
    Commissars
January 14(24)
Comrades, on behalf of the Council of People’s Commissars I must submit to you a report of its activities for the two months and fifteen days that have elapsed since the establishment of Soviet power and the Soviet Government in Russia.
Two months and fifteen days—that is only five days more than the preceding workers’ power lasted and ruled over a whole country, or over the exploiters and the capitalists, the power of the Paris workers at the time of the Paris Commune of 1871.
We must first of all remember this workers’ power, we must cast our minds back and compare it with the Soviet power that was formed on October 25. And if we compare the preceding dictatorship of the proletariat with the present one we shall see at once what a gigantic stride the international working-class movement has made, and in what an immeasurably more favourable position Soviet power in Russia finds itself, notwithstanding the incredibly complicated conditions of war and economic ruin.
After retaining power for two months and ten days, the workers of Paris, who for the first time in history established the Commune, the embryo of Soviet power, perished at the hands of the French Cadets, Mensheviks and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries of a Kaledin type. The French workers had to pay an unprecedentedly heavy price for the first experience of workers’ government, the meaning and purpose of which the overwhelming majority of the peasants in France did not know.
We find ourselves in immeasurably more favourable circumstances because the Russian soldiers, workers and peasants were able 'to create the Soviet Government, an apparatus which informed the whole world of their methods of struggle. It is this that puts the Russian workers and peasants in a position that differs from the power of the Paris proletariat. They had no apparatus, the country did not understand them; we were immediately able to rely on Soviet power, and that is why we never doubted that Soviet power enjoys the sympathy and the warmest and most devoted support of the overwhelming majority of the people, and that therefore Soviet power is invincible.
Those who were sceptical of Soviet power and frequently, either consciously or unconsciously, sold and betrayed it for compromise with the capitalists and the imperialists, raised a deafening clamour about the power of the proletariat alone not being able to be maintained in Russia. As if any Bolsheviks or their supporters forgot even for a moment that in Russia only that power could last for any length of time that would be able to unite the working class and the majority of the peasants, all the working and exploited classes, in a single, inseparably interconnected force fighting against the landowners and the bourgeoisie.
We never doubted that only the alliance of the workers and the poor peasants, the semi-proletarians, mentioned in our Party Programme, can, in Russia, embrace the majority of the population arid ensure firm support for the government. And after October 25 we were immediately able, in the course of several weeks, to overcome all difficulties and establish a government on the basis of this firm alliance.
Yes, comrades! When the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, in its old form—when the peasants did not yet understand who in this party were real advocates of socialism—put forward the slogan of egalitarian land tenure, without caring who was to put it through, whether it was to be effected in alliance with the bourgeoisie or not, we branded that as a fraud. And this section, which has now realised that the people are not with it and that it is a bubble, claimed that it could carry out egalitarian land tenure in alliance with the bourgeoisie. In this lay the basic fraud. And when the Russian revolution presented an example of collaboration between the working people and the bourgeoisie, in the greatest moment in the life of the people; when the war had been ruining the people and dooming millions to death from starvation and its consequences showed what compromise meant in practice; when the Soviets themselves experienced it and felt it after having passed through the school of compromise, it became obvious that there was a sound, virile and great socialist core in the teachings of those who wanted to unite the working section of the peasants with the great socialist movement of the workers of the whole world.
And as soon as this became a clear and distinct practical question to the peasants, something happened of which no one had any doubt, as has now been proved by the Peasants’ Soviets and Congresses: when the time came to implement socialism, the peasants were able to see clearly these two main political lines—alliance with the bourgeoisie, or alliance with the working people. They then realised that the party which expressed the real aims and interests of the peasants was the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party. And when we concluded our government alliance with this party, we, from the very outset, arranged it so that the alliance rested on the clearest and most obvious principles. If the peasants of Russia want to socialise the land in alliance with the workers who will nationalise the banks and establish workers’ control, then they are our loyal colleagues, our most loyal and valuable allies. Comrades, no socialist would refuse to admit the obvious truth that between socialism and capitalism there lies a long, more or less difficult transitional period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and that the forms this period will take will be determined to a large extent by whether small or big ownership, small or large-scale farming, predominates. It goes without saying that the transition to socialism in Estland, that small country in which the whole population is literate, and which consists of large-scale farms, cannot be the same as the transition to socialism in Russia, which is mainly a petty-bourgeois country. This must be taken into account.
Every politically-conscious socialist says that socialism cannot be imposed upon the peasants by force and that we must count only on the power of example and on the mass of the peasants assimilating day-to-day experience. How would the peasants prefer to pass to socialism? This is the problem which now confronts the Russian peasants in practice. How can they support the socialist proletariat and begin the transition to socialism? The peasants have already tackled this transition, and we have complete confidence in them.
The alliance we concluded with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries is built on a firm basis and is growing stronger and stronger by the hour. At first we on the Council of People’s Commissars feared that factional struggle would hinder the work, but now, after the experience of two months’ work together, I must say definitely that on the majority of questions we arrive at unanimous decisions.
We know that only when experience has shown the peasants, for example, the kind of exchange there must be between town and country they will themselves, from below, on the basis of their own experience, establish their own connections. On the other hand, the experience of the Civil War has demonstrated to the peasants that there is no other road to socialism except the dictatorship of the proletariat and the ruthless suppression of the rule of the exploiters. (Applause)
Comrades, every time we touch upon this theme, at the present meeting, or in the Central Executive Committee, I, from time to time, hear from the Right side of the meeting the exclamation “Dictator!” Yes, “when we were socialists” everyone recognised the dictatorship of the proletariat; they even wrote about it in their programmes, they were indignant at the widespread false idea that it was possible to persuade and prove to the population that the working people ought not to be exploited, that this was sinful and disgraceful, and that once people were persuaded of this there would be paradise on earth. No, this utopian notion was smashed in theory long ago, and now our task is to smash it in practice.
We must not depict socialism as if socialists will bring it to us on a plate all nicely dressed. That will never happen. Not a single problem of the class struggle has ever been solved in history except by violence. When violence is exercised by the working people, by the mass of exploited against the exploiters—then we are for it! (Stormy applause.) And we are not in the least disturbed by the howls of those people who consciously or unconsciously side with the bourgeoisie, or who are so frightened by them, so oppressed by their rule, that they have been flung into consternation at the sight of this unprecedentedly acute class struggle, have burst into tears, forgotten all their premises and demand that we perform the impossible, that we socialists achieve complete victory without fighting against the exploiters and without suppressing their resistance.
As far back as the summer of 1917 the exploiters understood that it is a matter of “the last and decisive battles”, and that if the Soviets came to power the last bulwark of the bourgeoisie, their principal source for suppressing the working people, would be torn out of their hands.
That is why the October Revolution began this systematic and unswerving struggle to compel the exploiters to cease their resistance and to become reconciled to the idea, no matter how difficult that may be for even the best of them, that the rule of the exploiting classes has gone never to return, that from now on the ordinary peasant will give the orders and that they must obey, however unpleasant that may be.
This will entail many difficulties, sacrifices and mistakes; it is something new, unprecedented in history and cannot be studied from books. It goes without saying that this is the greatest and most difficult transition that has ever occurred in history; but there is no other way to make this great transition and the fact that Soviet power has been established in Russia has shown that it is the revolutionary people who are richest of all in revolutionary experience—when millions come to the assistance of a few score of Party people—the people who actually take their exploiters by the throat.
That is why civil war has acquired predominance in Russia at the present time. Against us is advanced tile slogan: “Down with civil war!” I happened to hear this shouted from the Bight benches of the so-called Constituent Assembly. Down with civil war.... What does that mean? Civil war against whom? Against Kornilov, Kerensky and Byabushinsky who are spending millions to bribe vagabonds and officials? Against the saboteurs who, consciously or unconsciously, are accepting these bribes? Undoubtedly, among the latter there are ignorant people who accept these bribes unconsciously, because they cannot even imagine that the old bourgeois system can and must be destroyed to the very foundation and that an entirely new, socialist society can and must be built up on its ruins. Undoubtedly there are people like that, but does that alter the situation?
That is why the representatives of the propertied classes are staking their all, that is why these are the last and decisive battles for them, and they would stop at no crime in their efforts to smash Soviet power. Does not the whole history of socialism, particularly of French socialism, which is so rich in revolutionary striving, show us that when the working people themselves take power in their hands the ruling classes resort to unheard-of crimes and shootings if it is a matter of protecting their money-bags. When these people talk to us about civil war we answer them with ridicule; but when they spread their slogans among the students we say—you are deceiving them!
The class struggle did not accidentally assume its latest form, the form in which the exploited class takes all the means of power in its own hands in order to completely destroy its class enemy, the bourgeoisie, in order to sweep from the land of Russia not only the bureaucrats, but also the landowners, as the Russian peasants in several gubernias have done.
We are told that the sabotage with which the bureaucrats and the landowners met the Council of People’s Commissars is an indication of their unwillingness to assist socialism, as if it were not clear that the whole of this gang of capitalists and swindlers, vagabonds and saboteurs, represent a single gang bribed by the bourgeoisie and resisting the power of the working people. Of course, those who thought that it was possible to leap straight from capitalism to socialism, or those who imagined that it was possible to convince the majority of the population that this could be achieved through the medium of the Constituent Assembly—those who believed in this bourgeois-democratic fable, can go on blithely believing it, but let them not complain if life destroys this fable.
Those who have come to understand what the class struggle means, what the sabotage organised by the bureaucrats means, know that we cannot leap straight into socialism. There remained the bourgeoisie, capitalists, who hope to restore their rule and who defend their money-bags. There remained vagabonds, a section of corrupt people who are absolutely downtrodden by capitalism and who are unable to grasp the idea of the proletarian struggle. There remained office employees, bureaucrats who believe that it is in the interests of society to protect the old system. how can anyone imagine that the victory of socialism can come about except by the complete collapse of these sections, except by the complete destruction of the Russian and European bourgeoisie? Do you think the Ryabushinskys do not understand their class interests? It is they who are paying the saboteurs not to work. Or do they operate disunited? Are they not operating in conjunction with the French, British and American capitalists by buying up securities? It remains to be seen whether they will get much out of these transactions. Will not the heaps of securities they are now buying up turn out to be merely useless heaps of scrap-paper?
That is why, comrades, our reply to all the reproaches and accusations hurled against us of employing terror, dictatorship, civil war, although we are far from having resorted to real terror, because we are stronger than they— we have the Soviets, it will be sufficient if we nationalise the banks and confiscate their property in order to compel them to submit—our reply to all these charges of instigating civil war is: yes, we have openly proclaimed what no other government has been able to proclaim. The first government in the world that can speak openly of civil war is the government of the workers, peasants and soldiers. Yes, we have started and we are waging civil war against the exploiters. The more straightforwardly we say this, the more quickly will this war come to an end, the more quickly will all the working and exploited people understand us, will understand that Soviet power is fighting for the real, vital cause of all the working people.
Comrades, I do not think we shall achieve victory in this struggle quickly, but we are very rich in experience: we have managed to achieve a great deal in the course of two months. We have experienced Kerensky’s attempt to launch an attack against Soviet power and the complete
failure of this attempt. We have experienced the organisation of power of the Ukrainian Kerenskys—t.he struggle has not yet ended there, but to anyone who has watched it., who has heard at least a few truthful reports from representatives of Soviet power, it is obvious that tile bourgeois elements of the Ukrainian Rada are living their last days. (Applause) There cannot be the slightest doubt about the victory of Soviet power, of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, over the Ukrainian bourgeois Rada.
As for the struggle against Kaledin—here, indeed, everything rests on the basis of the exploitation of the working people, on the basis of the bourgeois dictatorship—if there is any social basis at all against Soviet power. The Peasants’ Congress has clearly demonstrated that Kaledin’s cause is hopeless; the working people are against him. The experience of Soviet power, propaganda by deeds, by the example of the Soviet organisations, is having its effect, and Kaledin’s stronghold in the Don Region is how collapsing—not so much externally as internally.
That is why, looking at the civil war front in Russia, we can say with complete conviction: here the victory of Soviet power is complete and absolutely assured. And, comrades, the victory of Soviet power is being achieved because right from the outset it began to realise the age-old aspirations of socialism, while consistently and determinedly relying on the people and considering it to be its duty to awaken the most oppressed and downtrodden sections of society to active life, to raise them to socialist creative work. That is why the old army with its barrack-square drilling and torture of soldiers has retreated into the past. It has been thrown on the scrap-heap, nothing remains of it. (Applause) The complete democratisation of the army has been carried out.
Permit me to relate an incident that occurred when I was in the carriage of a Finnish train and I overheard a conversation between several Finns and an old woman. I could not take part in the conversation because I cannot speak Finnish. But one of the Finns turned to me and said: “Do you know the curious thing this old woman said? She said, 'Now there is no need to fear the man with the gun. I was in the woods one day and I met a man with a gun, and instead of taking the firewood I had collected from me, he added some more.”’
When I heard that, I said to myself: let the hundreds of newspapers, no matter what they call themselves—socialist, near-socialist, etc.—let hundreds of extremely loud voices shout at us, “dictators”, “violators”, and similar words. We know that another voice is now rising from among the people; they say to themselves: now we need not be afraid of the man with the gun because he protects the working people and will be ruthless in suppressing the rule of the exploiters. (Applause) This is what the people have felt, and that is why the propaganda that simple and uneducated people are carrying on when they relate how the Red Guardsare turning their might against the exploiters—that propaganda is invincible. It will spread among millions and tens of millions, and will firmly create what the French Commune of the nineteenth century began to create, but was able to continue for only a very short time because it was wrecked by the bourgeoisie—it will create a socialist Red Army, something all socialists have always aimed at, i.e., the general arming of the people. It will create new Red Guard cadres that will enable us to train the working people for the armed struggle.
It used to be said about Russia that she would be unable to fight because she would have no officers. But we must not forget what these very bourgeois officers said as they observed the workers fighting against Kerensky and Kaledin. They said: “The Red Guards’ technical level is very low, but if these people had a little training they would have an invincible army.” This is because, for the first time in the history of the world struggle, elements have entered the army which are not the vehicles of bureaucratic knowledge, but are guided by the idea of the struggle to emancipate the exploited. And when the work we have commenced is completed, the Russian Soviet Republic will be invincible. (Applause)
Comrades, the road which Soviet power has traversed insofar as concerns the socialist army has also been traversed insofar as concerns another instrument of the ruling classes, an even more subtle, an even more complicated instrument—the bourgeois court, which claimed to maintain order, but which, as a matter of fact, was a blind, subtle instrument for the ruthless suppression of the exploited, an(h an instrument for protecting the interests of the moneybags. Soviet power acted in the way all the proletarian revolutions had shown that it must act; it immediately threw the 01(1 court on to the scrap-heap. Let them shout that we, without reforming the old court, immediately threw it on to the scrap-heap. By that we paved the way for a real people’s court, and not so much by the force of repressive measures as by massive example, the authority of the working people, without formalities; we transformed the court from an instrument of exploitation into an instrument of education on the firm foundations of socialist society. There is no doubt whatever that we cannot attain such a society at once.
These, then, are the main steps Soviet power has taken along the road indicated by the experience of the great popular revolutions throughout the world. There has not been a single revolution in which the working people did not begin to take some steps along this road in order to set up a new state power. Unfortunately, they only began to do this, but were unable to finish, they were unable to create the new type of state power. We have created it—we have already established a socialist Republic of Soviets.
I have no illusions about our having only just entered the period of transition to socialism, about not yet having reached socialism. But if you say that our state is a socialist Republic of Soviets, you will be right. You will be as right as those who call many Western bourgeois republics democratic republics although everybody knows that not one of even the most democratic of these republics is completely democratic. They grant scraps of democracy, they cut off tiny bits of the rights of the exploiters, but the working people are as much oppressed there as they are everywhere else. Nevertheless, we say that the bourgeois system is represented by both old monarchies and by constitutional republics.
And so in our case now. We are far from having completed even the transitional period from capitalism to socialism. We have never cherished the hope that we could finish it without the aid of the international proletariat. We never had any illusions on that score, and we know how difficult is the road that leads from capitalism to socialism. But it is our duty to say that our Soviet Republic is a socialist republic because we have taken this road, and our words will riot be empty words.
We have initiated many measures undermining the capitalists’ rule. We know that our power had to unite the activities of all our institutions by a single principle, and this principle we express in the words: “Russia is declared to be a Socialist Republic of Soviets.” (Applause) This will be that truth which rests on what we must do and have already begun to do, this will be the best unification of all our activities, the proclamation of our programme, a call to the working people and the exploited of all countries who either do not know at all what socialism is, or, what is worse, believe that socialism is the Chernov-Tsereteli mess of bourgeois reforms which we have tasted and tried during the ten months of the revolution and which we have become convinced is a falsification and not socialism.
And that is why 'free” Britain and France did all they could during the ten months of our revolution to prevent a single copy of Bolshevik and Left Socialist-Revolutionary newspapers from entering their countries. They had to act in this way because they saw that the workers and peasants in all countries instinctively grasped what the Russian workers were doing. There was not a single meeting where news about the Russian revolution and the slogan of Soviet power was not hailed with stormy applause. The working people and the exploited everywhere have already come into conflict with their party top leadership. The old socialism of these leaders is not yet buried like that of Chkheidze and Tsereteli in Russia, but it is already done for in all countries of the world, it is already dead.
A new state—the Republic of Soviets, the republic of the working people, of the exploited classes that are breaking down the old bourgeois barriers, now stands against the old bourgeois system. New state forms have been created, which make it possible to suppress the exploiters, to overcome the resistance of this insignificant handful who are still strong because of yesterday’s money-bags and yesterday’s store of knowledge. They—the professors, teachers and engineers—transform their knowledge into an instrument for the exploitation of the working people, saying they want their knowledge to serve the bourgeoisie, otherwise they refuse to work. But their power has been broken by the workers’ and peasants’ revolution, and a state is rising against them in which the people themselves freely elect their own representatives.
It is precisely at the present time that we can say that we really have- an organisation of power which clearly indicates the transition to the complete abolition of any power, of any state. This will be possible when every trace of exploitation has been abolished, that is, in socialist society.
Now I shall deal briefly with the measures which the socialist Soviet Government of Russia has begun to realise. The nationalisation of the banks was one of the first measures adopted for the purpose, not only of wiping the landowners from the face of Russian earth, but also of eradicating the rule of the bourgeoisie and the possibility of capital oppressing millions and tens of millions of the working people. The banks are important centres of modern capitalist economy. They collect fantastic wealth and distribute it over this vast country; they are the nerve centres of capitalist life. They are subtle and intricate organisations, which grew up in the course of centuries; and against them were hurled the first blows of Soviet power which at first encountered desperate resistance in the State Bank. But this resistance did not deter Soviet power. We succeeded in the main thing, in organising the State Bank; this main thing is in the hands of the workers and peasants. After these basic measures, which still require a lot of working out in detail, we proceeded to lay our hands on the private banks.
We did not act in the way the compromisers would probably have recommended us to do, i.e., first wait until the Constituent Assembly is convened, then perhaps draft a bill and introduce it in the Constituent Assembly and by that inform the bourgeoisie of our intentions and enable them to find a loophole through which to extricate themselves from this unpleasant thing; perhaps draw them into our company, and then make state laws—that would be a “state act”.
That would be the rejection of socialism. We acted quite simply; not fearing to call forth the reproaches of the “educated” people, or rather of the uneducated supporters of the bourgeoisie who were trading in the remnants of their knowledge, we said we had at our disposal armed workers and peasants. This morning they must occupy all the private banks. (Applause) After they have done that, after power is in our hands, only after this, we shall discuss what measures to adopt. In the morning the banks were occupied and in the evening the Central Executive Committee issued a decree: “The banks are declared national property”— state control, the socialisation of banking, its transfer to Soviet power, took place.
There was not a man among us who could imagine that an intricate and subtle apparatus like banking, which grew out of the capitalist system of economy in the course of centuries, could be broken or transformed in a few days. We never said that. And when scientists, or pseudo-scientists, shook their heads and prophesied, we said: you can prophesy what you like. We know only one way for the proletarian revolution, namely, to occupy the enemy’s positions-to learn to rule by experience, from our mistakes. We do not in the least belittle the difficulties in our path, but we have done the main thing. The source of capitalist wealth has been undermined in the place of its distribution. After all this, the repudiation of the state loans, the overthrow of the financial yoke, was a very easy step. The transition to confiscation of the factories, after workers’ control had been introduced, was also very easy. When we were accused of breaking up production into separate departments by introducing workers’ control, we brushed aside this nonsense. In introducing workers’ control, we knew that it would take much time before it spread to the whole of Russia, but we wanted to show that we recognise only one road —changes from below; we wanted the workers themselves, from below, to draw up the new, basic economic principles. Much time will be required for this.
From workers’ control we passed on to the creation of a Supreme Economic Council. Only this measure, together with the nationalisation of the banks and railways which will be carried out within the next few days, will make it possible for us to begin work to build up a new socialist economy. We know perfectly well the difficulties that confront us in this work; but we assert that only those who set to work to carry out this task relying on the experience and the instinct of the working people are socialists in deed. The people will commit many mistakes, but the main thing has been done. They know that when they appeal to Soviet power they will get whole-hearted support against the exploiters. There is not a single measure intended to ease their work that was not entirely supported by Soviet power. Soviet power does not know everything and cannot handle everything in time, and very often it is confronted with difficult tasks. Very often delegations of workers and peasants come to the government and ask, for example, what to do with such-and-such a piece of land. And frequently I myself have felt embarrassed when I saw that they had no very definite views. And I said to them: you are the power, do all you want to do, take all you want, we shall support you, but take care of production, see that production is useful. Take up useful work, you will make mistakes, but you will learn. And the workers have already begun to learn; they have already begun to fight against the saboteurs. Education has been turned into a fence which hinders the advance of the working classes; it will be pulled down.
Undoubtedly, the war is corrupting people both in the rear and at the front; people who are working on war supplies are paid far above the rates, and this attracts all those who hid themselves to keep out of the war, the vagabond and semi-vagabond elements who are imbued with one desire, to “grab” something and clear out. But these elements are the worst that has remained of the old capitalist system and are the vehicles of all the old evils; these we must kick out, remove, and we must put in the factories all the best proletarian elements and form them into nuclei of future socialist Russia. This is not an easy task, it will give rise to many conflicts, to much friction and many clashes. We, the Council of People’s Commissars, and I personally, have heard complaints and threats from them, but we have remained calm, knowing that now we have a judge to whom we can appeal. That judge is the Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies. (Applause). The word of this judge is indisputable, and we shall always rely upon it.
Capitalism deliberately differentiates the workers in order to rally an insignificant handful of the upper section of the working class around the bourgeoisie. Conflicts with this section are inevitable. We shall not achieve socialism without a struggle. But we are ready to fight, we have started it and we shall finish it with the aid of the apparatus called the Soviets. The Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies will easily solve any problem we bring before it. For however strong the group of privileged workers may be, when they are brought before the representative body of all the workers, then this court, I repeat, will be indisputable for them. This sort of adjustment is only just beginning. The workers and peasants have not yet sufficient confidence in their own strength; age-old tradition has made them far too used to waiting for orders from above. They have not yet fully appreciated the fact that the proletariat is the ruling class; there are still elements among them who are frightened and downtrodden and who imagine that they must pass through the despicable school of the bourgeoisie. This most despicable of bourgeois notions has remained alive longer than all the rest, but it is dying and will die out completely. And we are convinced that with every step Soviet power takes the number of people will constantly grow who have completely thrown off the old bourgeois notion that a simple worker and peasant cannot administer the state. Well, if he sets to doing it, he can and will learn! (Applause).
And it will be our organisational task to select leaders and organisers from among the people. This enormous, gigantic work is now on the agenda. There could even be no thought of carrying it out if it were not for Soviet power, a filtering apparatus which can promote people.
Not only have we a state law on control, we have something even far more valuable—attempts on the part of the proletariat to enter into agreements with the manufacturers’ associations in order to guarantee the workers’ management over whole branches of industry. Such an agreement has begun to be drawn up, and is almost completed, between the leather workers and the all-Russia leather manufacturers’ society. I attach very special importance to these agreements,[2] they show that the workers are becoming aware of their strength.
Comrades, in my report I have not dealt with the particularly painful and difficult questions of peace and the food supply, because they are special items on the agenda and will be discussed separately.
My purpose in making this brief report was to show, as it appears to me and to the whole of the Council of People’s Commissars, the entire history of what we have experienced during the past two and a half months, how the relation of class forces took shape in this new period of the Russian revolution, how a new state power was formed and what social tasks confront it.
Russia has started to achieve socialism in the right way— by the nationalisation of the banks and the transfer of all the land entirely to the working people. We are well aware of the difficulties that lie ahead, but we are convinced, by comparing our revolution with previous revolutions, that we shall achieve enormous successes and that we are on the road that guarantees complete victory.
And with us will go the masses of the more advanced countries, countries which have been divided by a predatory war, whose workers have passed through a longer period of training in democracy. When people depict the difficulties of our task, when we are told that the victory of socialism is possible only on a world scale, we regard this merely as an attempt, a particularly hopeless attempt, on the part of the bourgeoisie and of its voluntary and involuntary supporters to distort the irrefutable truth. The final victory of socialism in a single country is of course impossible. Our contingent of workers and peasants which is upholding Soviet power is one of the contingents of the great world army, which at present has been split by the world war, but which is striving for unity, and every piece of information, every fragment of a report about our revolution, every name, the proletariat greets with loud and sympathetic cheers, because it knows that in Russia the common cause is being pursued, the cause of the proletariat’s uprising, the international socialist revolution. A living example, tackling the job somewhere in one country is more effective than any proclamations and conferences; this is what inspires the working people in all countries.
The October strike in 1905—the first steps of the victorious revolution—immediately spread to Western Europe and then, in 1905, called forth the movement of the Austrian workers; already at that time we had a practical illustration of the value of the example of revolution, of the action by the workers in one country, and today we see that the socialist revolution is maturing by the hour in all countries of the world.
If we make mistakes and blunders and meet with obstacles on our way, that is not what is important to them; what is important to them is our example, that is what unites them. They say: we shall go together and conquer, come what may. (Applause).
The great founders of socialism, Marx and Engels, having watched the development of the labour movement and the growth of the world socialist revolution for a number of decades saw clearly that the transition from capitalism to socialism would require prolonged birth-pangs, a long period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the break-up of all that belonged to the past, the ruthless destruction of all forms of capitalism, the co.-operation of the workers of all countries, who would have to combine their efforts to ensure complete victory. And they said that at the end of the nineteenth century “the Frenchman will begin it, and the German will finish it”[164]—.the Frenchman would begin it because in the course of decades of revolution he had acquired that intrepid initiative in revolutionary action that made him the vanguard of the socialist revolution.
Today we see a different combination of international socialist forces. We say that it is easier for the movement to start in the countries that are not among those exploiting countries which have opportunities for easy plunder and are able to bribe the upper section of their workers. The pseudo-socialist, nearly all ministerial, Chernov-Tsereteli parties of Western Europe do not accomplish anything, and they lack firm foundations. We have seen the example of Italy; during the past few days we witnessed the heroic struggle of the Austrian workers against the predatory imperialists.185 Though the pirates may succeed in holding up the movement for a time, they cannot stop it altogether, it is invincible.
The example of the Soviet Republic will stand before them for a long time to come. Our socialist Republic of Soviets will stand secure, as a torch of international socialism and as an example to all the working people. Over there—conflict, war, bloodshed, the sacrifice of millions of people, capitalist exploitation; here—a genuine policy of peace and a socialist Republic of Soviets.
Things have turned out differently from what Marx and Engels expected and we, the Russian working and exploited classes, have the honour of being the vanguard of the international socialist revolution; we can now see clearly how far the development of the revolution will go. The Russian began it—the German, the Frenchman and the Englishman will finish it, and socialism will be victorious. (Applause)
2 Concluding Speech  On The Report Of The Council Of People’s Commissars  
January 12 (25) Having listened today to the speakers on the Right, who voiced objections to my report, I am surprised that they have not yet learned anything and have forgotten all that they in vain call “Marxism”. One of the objectors declared that we had favoured the dictatorship of democracy, that we had recognised the rule of democracy. That declaration was so absurd, so utterly meaningless, that it is merely a collection of words. It was just like saying “iron snow”, or something similar. (Laughter.) Democracy is a form of bourgeois state championed by all traitors to genuine socialism, who now find themselves at the head of official socialism and who assert that democracy is contrary to the dictatorship of the proletariat. Until the revolution transcended the limits of the bourgeois system, we were for democracy; but as soon as we saw the first signs of socialism in the progress of the revolution, we took a firm and resolute stand for the dictatorship of the proletariat.
It is strange that people who cannot or refuse to understand this plain truth, this definition of the meaning of the terms “democracy” and “dictatorship of the proletariat”, should make bold to bring-before so numerous an assembly old, utterly worthless rubbish, such as that in which all the objecting gentlemen’s speeches abound. Democracy is formal parliamentarism, but in reality it is a continuous, cruel mockery, heartless, unbearable oppression of the working people by the bourgeoisie. And this can only be denied by those who are not true spokesmen for the working class but wretched men in mufflers who have kept away from life all the time, who have been sleeping with an old, shabby little book carefully stowed away under the pillow, the unwanted book that serves them as a guide and manual in implanting official socialism. But the minds of tens of millions of those who are doing things create something infinitely loftier than the greatest genius can foresee. Genuine, revolutionary socialism did not break away today but at the beginning of the war. This significant break, this rift in socialist theory, has come about in every country and every state. And it is splendid that socialism has split!
We can counter the accusation that we are fighting against “socialists” by saying merely that in the epoch of parliamentarism these supporters of the latter no longer have anything in common with socialism but have become decayed, obsolete and backward, and have ended by deserting to the bourgeoisie. “Socialists” who shouted about “defending the country” during a war resulting from the imperialist urge of international robbers are not socialists but hangers-on of the bourgeoisie, their dish-lickers.
Those who talk so much about the dictatorship of democracy merely utter meaningless, absurd phrases which indicate neither economic knowledge nor political understanding.
One of the objectors said here that the Paris Commune can be proud of the fact that during the Paris workers’ uprising there was no violence or arbitrary action on their part; but it is beyond doubt that the Commune fell only because it did not make proper use of armed force at the right moment, although it won undying fame in history, for it was the first to put the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat into practice.
Commenting briefly on the struggle against the bourgeoisie, landowners and capitalists, the speaker declared firmly and resolutely, amidst a burst of applause: “Say what you may, the bourgeoisie will in the end be forced by the will of the revolutionary people either to capitulate, or to perish.”
Drawing a parallel between anarchism and Bolshevik views, Comrade Lenin said that at that time, in the period of a radical break-up of the bourgeois system, the concept of anarchism was finally assuming concrete features. But if the oppression of the bourgeois system was to be abolished, there would have to be firm revolutionary power of the working classes, the power of a revolutionary state. This was the essence of communism. When the masses were themselves taking up arms to start an unrelenting struggle against the exploiters, when a new people’s power was being applied that had nothing in common with parliamentary power, it was no longer the old state, outdated in its traditions and forms, that they had before them, but something new, something based on the creative power of the people. And while some anarchists spoke of the Soviets with fear because they were still influenced by obsolete views, the new, fresh trend in anarchism was definitely on the side of the Soviets, because it saw their vitality and their ability to win the sympathy of the working masses and arouse their creative energy.
“Your sin and blindness,” said the speaker, turning to the “objectors”, “are due to your failure to learn anything from the revolution. As early as April 4, I affirmed, speaking in this hail, that the Soviets are the highest form of democracy. Either the Soviets will perish and then the revolution will be irrevocably lost, or the Soviets will live and then it will be ridiculous to talk of a bourgeois-democratic revolution at a time when the socialist system is on the way to its full development and capitalism is collapsing. The Bolsheviks spoke of a bourgeois-democratic revolution in 1905, but today, when the Soviets are in power, when the workers, soldiers and peasants have said—in a war situation unprecedented for hardships and horrors, in an atmosphere of ruin, and in the face of death by starvation—that they will assume full power and will themselves set about building a new life, there can be no question of a bourgeois-democratic revolution. And the Bolsheviks said as much at their congresses and meetings and conferences, and in their resolutions and decisions, as early as last April.
'“To those who say that we have done nothing, that we have been inactive all the time, that Soviet rule has borne no fruits, we can say this: Look wherever there are working people, look among the masses, and you will see organisational, creative work in full swing, you will see the stir of a life that is being renewed and hallowed by the revolution. The peasants are taking over the land in the countryside, the workers are seizing the factories, and all kinds of organisations are springing up everywhere.
“Soviet power is striving to bring the war to an end, and we are confident that it will achieve this goal earlier than Kerensky government spokesmen have promised. For the revolution has become a factor in the matter of ending the war, a factor which has denounced treaties and repudiated loans. The war will come to an end due to the international revolutionary movement.”
In conclusion, the speaker commented in a few words on counter-revolutionary saboteurs, saying that they were groups bribed by the bourgeoisie, which showered its gifts on the sabotaging officials who declared war on the Soviet state, for the triumph of reaction. To them it was doomsday, the irrevocable end of everything when they saw the people striking vigorously at the bourgeoisie with a peasants’ and workers’ axe. “Our only fault, if any, is that we were much too humane, much too kind-hearted, towards the monstrously treacherous representatives of the bourgeois-imperialist system.
“A few days ago some Novaga Zhizn writers visited me, saying they had come on behalf of bank employees who wanted to take up service and submit fully to Soviet power, stopping the policy of sabotage. High time, I answered. But, speaking confidentially, if they imagine that having begun those talks, we shall cede our revolutionary positions one iota, they are sorely mistaken.
“The world has never seen anything like that which is now taking place here in Russia, in this vast country broken up into a number of separate states and containing an enormous number of heterogeneous nationalities and peoples. I refer to the immense organisational work in every uyezd and region, the organisation of the lower strata, the work of the masses themselves, the creative, constructive activity, which encounters obstacles raised by various bourgeois representatives of imperialism. They, the workers and peasants, are engaged in an effort unprecedented in its titanic aims; together with the Soviets, they will smash capitalist exploitation, and bourgeois oppression will in the end be abolished once and for all.”
 
3 Draft Decree On Expunging References To The  Constituent Assembly From Soviet Legislation Decree A number of laws, decrees and decisions taken by the Soviet Government contain references to the Constituent Assembly and its legislative character.
All these references naturally become irrelevant and lapse with the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly by the Central Executive Committee and the approval of this step by the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets.
Accordingly, the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets resolves: any references to the forthcoming Constituent Assembly shall be expunged from all new editions of decrees and laws of the Soviet Government.
Writtin on January 18 (31). 1918
4 Summing-Up Speech At The Congress January 18 (31) Comrades, before the Third Congress of Soviets closes we must establish with complete impartiality the momentous part it has had to play in the history of the international revolution and of mankind. There are incontestable grounds for saying that the Third Congress of Soviets has opened a new epoch in world history and there is growing awareness of its significance in these times of world revolution. It has consolidated the organisation of the new state power which was created by the October Revolution and has projected the lines of future socialist construction for the whole world, for the working people of all countries.
The new system of the socialist Soviet Republic, as a federation of free republics of the different nations inhabiting Russia, has been finally accepted in this country in the sphere of domestic politics. It is now clear to all, and even to our enemies, I daresay, that the new system, the Soviet power, is not an invention or a party trick, but is the result of the development of life itself, the outcome of the world revolution as it spontaneously takes shape. You will recall that all great revolutions invariably strove to raze the old capitalist system to the ground; they strove not only to win political rights but also to wrest the very reins of government from the hands of the ruling classes, and all the exploiters and oppressors of the working people, so as to put an end to all exploitation and all oppression for good. Great revolutions strove to demolish this old exploiting state machine but had not managed to bring it off until now. And now Russia, in virtue of the peculiarities of her economic and political position, has first achieved this transfer of government powers into the hands of the working people. We shall now proceed to build, on the space cleared of historical rubbish, the airy towering edifice of the socialist society. A new type of state power is being created for the first time in history, a power that the will of the revolution has called upon to wipe out all exploitation, oppression and slavery the world over.
Let us take a look at what the new socialist principle of government has yielded in the sphere of our domestic policy. Comrades, you will recall that just recently the bourgeois press was vociferously accusing us of destroying the Russian state and saying that we were incapable of running the country, and so all the nationalities — Finland, the Ukraine, etc—were leaving us. The bourgeois press, transported with malicious joy, carried almost daily reports of such “secessioris”. We, comrades, had a better understanding than they of the main causes of this phenomenon which were rooted in the working people’s mistrust of the conciliatory imperialist government of Kerensky and Co. We kept silent, being quite sure that our just principles and our government would demonstrate our true purposes and aspirations to all the working people better than words.
We proved to be right. We see now that our ideas have won out in Finland and the Ukraine and are winning out on the Don, that they are awakening the working people’s class-consciousness and are organising them into a solid alliance. We acted without any diplomatists or the use of the old imperialist methods, but can point to the greatest result: the revolution has won, and those who have won are allied with us in a mighty revolutionary federation. We do not rule by dividing, as ancient Rome’s harsh maxim required, but by uniting all the working people with the unbreakable bonds of living interests and a sense of class. This our union, our new state is sounder than power based on violence which keeps artificial state entities hammered together with lies and bayonets in the way the imperialists want them. Thus, no sooner had the Finnish workers and peasants taken power than they sent us their expressions of loyalty to the world proletarian revolution and greetings which reveal unflinching determination to march with us along the path of the International.[3] There is the basis of our federation and I am profoundly convinced that more and more diverse federations of free nations will group themselves around revolutionary Russia. This federation is invincible and will grow quite freely, without the help of lies or bayonets. The laws and the state system which we are creating over here are the best earnest of its invincibility. You have just heard a reading of the law on the socialisation of land[4] Isn’t it a pledge of the unbreakable unity of the workers and peasants, isn’t it a guarantee that in this unity we shall be able to overcome all obstacles on the way to socialism?
I must tell you that these obstacles are tremendous. You can depend on the bourgeoisie to resort to every trick, to stake their all on crushing our unity. They can be expected to make use of liars, provocateurs, traitors, possibly, dupes, but henceforth we have nothing to fear, because we have established our own new state power and because we hold the reins of government. We shall throw the full weight of our power against any counter-revolutionary attempt. But the chief pillar of the new system is the organisational measures we shall be implementing for the sake of socialism. In this respect we are faced with a vast amount of work. You must bear in mind, comrades, that the imperialists, the world’s brigands, who had embroiled the nations in war, have disrupted the economic life of the world to its very roots. They have left us an onerous legacy, the work to restore what they had destroyed.
Of course, the working people had no experience in government but that does not scare us. The victorious proletariat looks out on a land that has now become a public good, and it will be quite able to organise the new production and consumption on socialist lines. In the old days, human genius, the brain of man, created only to give some the benefits of technology and culture, and to deprive others of the most essential—education and development. From now on all the marvels of science and the gains of culture belong to the nation as a whole, and never again will man’s brain and human genius be used for oppression and exploitation. Of this we are sure, so shall we not dedicate ourselves and work with abandon to fulfil this greatest of all historical tasks? The working people will perform this titanic historical feat, for in them lie dormant the great forces of revolution, renascence and renovation.
We are no longer alone. In the last few days, momentous events have taken place not only in the Ukraine and the Don area, not only in the realm of our Kaledins and Kerenskys, but in Western Europe as well. You have already heard of the telegrams on the state of the revolution in Germany. The flames of a revolutionary wildfire are leaping higher and higher over the whole of this rotten old world system. It was no pie-in-the-sky theory, no armchair pipe dream that once we had established Soviet power we would induce others to make similar attempts in other countries. For I must repeat that the working people had no other way out of the slaughter. These attempts are now being consolidated as gains of the international revolution. We close this historic Congress of Soviets under the sign of the mounting world revolution, and the time is not far off when the working people of all countries will unite into a single world-wide state and join in a common effort to build a new socialist edifice. The way to this construction runs through the Soviets, as a form of the incipient world revolution. (Stormy applause.)
In greeting you I urge you to build this new edifice. You will return to your various places and will bend every effort to organise and consolidate our great victory. (The delegates rise and greet Comrade Lenin with stormy applause.)

[2] The reference is to the talks between the All-Russia Leather Workers’ Union with their employers for wider workers’ representation on the Central Leather Committee and its remoulding on democratic lines. The Central Committee and the district committees were reorganised in early 1918, with the workers getting two-thirds of the votes. On April 6. 1918, a telegram signed by Lenin was sell to all Soviets on the need to democratise the local organs of the leather industry and fulfil precisely the instructions issued by the Central and district committees of the leather industry.
[3] The reference is to the Message of the Revolutionary Finish Government to the Council of Peoples Commissars of the Russian Republic, published in Pravda (evening edition) No. 13, on January 17 (31), 1918.
The revolution in Finland broke out in mid-January 1918 in the southern industrial areas. On January 15 (28), the Finnish fled Guard occupied Helsingfors, the capital, and overthrew the reactionary bourgeois government of Svinhufvud . A revolutionary government of Finland, the Council of People’s Representatives, was setup on January 16 (29). Power in the towns and villages in the south of Finland passed into the hands of the workers. The Svinhufvud government was entrenched in the north and appealed to the German Government for help. Following the intervention of the German armed forces and a bitter civil war, the revolution in Finland was crushed in May 1918.
[4] The reference is to the Basic Law on the Socialisation of Land tabled for approval at the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets. The draft was edited by a commission of the Congress in which Lenin took part. In January 18 (31), 1918. the law (Section One—General Provisions) was approved by the Congress. It was further elaborated at joint sittings of the Congress of Land Committees and the peasant section of the Third Congress of Soviets. The final text of the law was approved by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on January 27 (February 9).

      The Council of People's Commissars lodges a protest over the
      German Government's movement of troops against the Russian
      Soviet Republic, which had declared the state of war ended and
      had started to demobilise its army on all fronts. The Workers'
      and Peasants' Government of Russia could not have expected such
      a step, especially since neither of the parties to the armistice
      had, directly or indirectly, made any announcement either on
      February 10, or at any other time, that the armistice was at an
      end, as both parties to the treaty of December 2 (15), 1917 had
      undertaken to do.

    
      The Council of People's Commissars finds itself forced, in the
      situation that has arisen, to declare its readiness formally to
      conclude peace on the terms the German Government demanded at
      Brest-Litovsk.

    
      At the same time, the Council of People's Commissars expresses
      its readiness, if the German Government should formulate its
      precise peace terms, to reply within 12 hours whether or not
      these terms are acceptable.

      The wireless message to the Government of the German Reich was
      sent to Berlin on the morning of February 19 on behalf of the
      Council of People's Commissars. But the German Government's
      reply, containing even harsher peace terms, was handed to the
      Soviet courier only on February 22 and was received in Petrograd
      on the morning of February 23; it demanded that the new peace
      terms should be studied within 48 hours. The Germans, while
      delaying their own reply, continued their offensive, and in
      those few days covered a great deal of territory; they occupied
      a number of towns and came within striking distance of
      Petrograd.

In order to save this exhausted and ravaged country from new ordeals of war we
    decided to make a very great sacrifice and informed the Germans of our readiness to sign
    their terms of peace. Our truce envoys left Rezhitsa for Dvinsk in the evening on February 20
    (7), and still there is no reply. The German Government is evidently in no hurry to
    reply. H obviously does not want peace. Fulfilling the task with which it has been charged by
    the capitalists of all countries, German militarism wants to strangle the Russian
    and Ukrainian workers and peasants, to return the land to the landowners, the mills and
    factories to the bankers, and power to the monarchy. The German generals want to
    establish their “order” in Petrograd and Kiev. The Socialist Republic of
    Soviets is in gravest danger. Until the proletariat of Germany rises and triumphs, it is
    the sacred duty of the workers and peasants of Russia devotedly to defend the Republic of
    Soviets against the hordes of bourgeois-imperialist Germany. The Council of People's
    Commissars resolves: (1) The country's entire manpower and resources are placed entirely
    at the service of revolutionary defence. (2) All Soviets and revolutionary organisations are
    ordered to defend every position to the last drop of blood. (3) Railway organisations
    and the Soviets associated with them must do their utmost to prevent the enemy from availing
    himself of the transport system; in the event of a retreat, they are to destroy the tracks
    and blow up or burn down the railway buildings; all rolling stock-carriages and
    locomotives-must be immediately dispatched eastward, into the interior of the country. (4)
    All grain and food stocks generally, as well as all valuable property in danger of falling
    into the enemy's hands, must be unconditionally destroyed; the duty of seeing that this is
    done is laid upon the local Soviets and their chairmen are made personally responsible. (5)
    The workers and peasants of Petrograd, Kiev, and of all towns, townships, villages and
    hamlets along the line of the new front are to mobilise battalions to dig trenches, under the
    direction of military experts. (6) These battalions are to include all able-bodied
    members of the bourgeois class, men and women, under the supervision of Red Guards; those who
    resist are to be shot. (7) All publications which oppose the cause of revolutionary defence
    and side with the German bourgeoisie, or which endeavour to take advantage of the invasion of
    the imperialist hordes in order to overthrow Soviet rule, are to be suppressed; able-bodied
    editors and members of the staffs of such publications are to be mobilised for the digging,
    of trenches or for other defence work. (8) Enemy agents, profiteers, marauders, hooligans,
    counter-revolutionary agitators and German spies are to be shot on the spot.

Dear Comrades,
The Organising Bureau of the Central Committee considers it essential to submit to you an
    explanation of the motives that led the Central Committee to agree to the peace terms
    proposed by the German Government. The Organising Bureau is addressing this explanation to
    you, comrades, in order that all Party members should be thoroughly informed of the point of
    view of the Central Committee, which, in the period between Congresses, represents the entire
    Party. The Organising Bureau considers it essential to state that the Central Committee was
    not unanimous en the question of signing the peace terms, since the decision has been made,
    however, it must be supported by the whole Party. A Party Congress is due in a few days, and
    only then will it be possible to decide the question of the extent to which the Central
    Committee rightly expressed the actual position of the whole Party. Until the Congress, all
    Party members, in pursuance of their duty to the Party and for the sake of the maintenance of
    unity in our Party ranks, will carry out the decisions of their central leading body, the
    Central Committee of the Party.
The absolute necessity of signing, at the given moment (February 24, 1918), an
    annexationist and unbelievably harsh peace treaty with Germany is due primarily to the fact
    that we have no army and cannot defend ourselves.
Everybody knows why since October 25, 1917, since the victory of the dictatorship of the
    proletariat and the poor peasantry, we have all become defencists, we are all for the defence
    of the fatherland.
From the point of view of defending the fatherland, it is impermissible for us to allow
    ourselves to he drawn into an armed conflict when we have no army and the enemy is armed to
    the teeth and excellently prepared.
The Soviet Socialist Republic cannot wage a war when the obviously overwhelming majority
    of the masses of workers, peasants and soldiers who elect deputies to the Soviets are against
    the war, It would be a rash gamble. It will be a different thing if an end is put to this
    war, excessively harsh though the terms of peace may be, and German imperialism again decides
    to start an aggressive war against Russia. Then the majority of the Soviets will most
    certainly he in favour of war.
To wage war today would amount objectively to falling for the provocation of the Russian
    bourgeoisie. They know full well that at the moment Russia is defenceless and would be
    crushed by even insignificant German forces, which would have only to cut the main railway
    lines to starve Petrograd and Moscow into surrendering. The bourgeoisie want war, because
    they want the overthrow of Soviet power and an agreement with the German bourgeoisie, the
    jubilation of the bourgeoisie when the German troops arrived in Dvinsk and Bezhitsa, Venden
    and Gapsal, Minsk and Drissa confirms this as clearly as can be.
Defence of revolutionary war at the present moment is nothing but an empty revolutionary
    phrase, it is impossible for a ruined peasant country to wage a modern war against advanced
    imperialism without an army and without the most serious economic preparation. It is beyond
    all doubt that German imperialism must be resisted, for it will crush us and hold us
    prisoner. It would, however, be empty talk to demand resistance specifically by means of
    armed uprising, especially now, when such resistance is obviously hopeless for us, and
    obviously to the advantage of the German and Russian bourgeoisie.
It is equally empty talk to argue in favour of revolutionary war at this moment on the
    grounds of support for the international socialist movement. If we make it easier for German
    imperialism to crush the Soviet Republic by our untimely acceptance of battle, we shall harm
    and not help the German and international working-class movement and the cause of socialism.
    We must help only the revolutionary internationalists in all countries by all-round,
    persistent and systematic work; but to undertake the gamble of launching an armed uprising,
    when it would obviously be a gamble, is unworthy of a Marxist.
If Liebknecht is victorious in two or three weeks (which is possible) he will, of course,
    get us out of all difficulties. It would, however, be simply foolish and would be turning the
    great slogan of the solidarity of the working people of all countries into sheer mockery if
    we were to assure the people that Liebknecht will certainly and unavoidably score victory
    within the next few weeks. Indeed, by arguing in this way we should he turning the great
    slogan "We bank on the world revolution" into an empty phrase.
Objectively the situation is similar to that of the summer of 1907. Then, it was the
    Russian monarchist Stolypin who crushed us and held us prisoner; today it is the German
    imperialist. Then, the slogan of an immediate insurrection, which, unfortunately, was
    supported by the entire Socialist-Revolutionary Party, proved to be an empty phrase. Today,
    at this very moment, the slogan of revolutionary war is obviously an empty phrase that
    attracts the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, who repeat the arguments of the Right
    Socialist-Revolutionaries. We are the prisoners of German imperialism and we have ahead of us
    a long and difficult struggle to overthrow that ringleader of world imperialism; this
    struggle is undoubtedly the last decisive struggle for socialism, but to begin that struggle
    at the present moment with an armed uprising against the leader of imperialism would be a
    gamble that no Marxist would ever undertake.
The systematic, unrelenting, all-round building up of the country's defence potential,
    self-discipline everywhere, the use of grievous defeat to improve discipline in all spheres
    of life for the purpose of the country's economic progress and the consolidation of Soviet
    power-that is the task of the day, that is the way to prepare a revolutionary war in deed and
    not merely in word.
In conclusion, the Organising Bureau considers it essential to state that, since the
    offensive of German imperialism has not yet been halted, all members of the Party must
    organise a concerted opposition to it. If it is impossible to sign a peace treaty, even the
    harshest, and gain time to prepare for new battles, our Party must emphasise the need to
    exert every effort for all-out resistance.
If we can gain time, gain even a brief respite for organisational work, we must do our
    best to get it. If we are granted no deferment our Party must call on the masses to fight, to
    engage in the most energetic self-defence., We are confident that all Party members will do
    their duty by the Party, by the working class of their country, by the people and the
    proletariat. By preserving Soviet power we are rendering the best, the most powerful support
    to the proletariat of all countries in their incredibly hard struggle against their own
    bourgeoisie. Today the cause of socialism could suffer no heavier blow than the collapse of
    Soviet power in Russia.
With comradely greetings, 

Organising Bureau of the Central Committee of the
    R.S.D.L.P. (Bolsheviks)

    The week from February 18 to 24, 1918, has been one that will be remembered as a great
    turning-point in the history of the Russian—and the international-revolution.
On February 27, 1917, the Russian proletariat, jointly with part of the peasantry who had
    been aroused by the course the war was taking, and also with the bourgeoisie, overthrew the
    monarchy. On April 21, 1917, the proletariat overthrew the absolute rule of the imperialist
    bourgeoisie and shifted power into the hands of the petty-bourgeoisie advocates of compromise
    with the bourgeoisie, On July 3, the urban proletariat gave the compromisers’
    government a severe shock by its spontaneous demonstration. On October 25, it overthrew that
    government and established the dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasantry.
This victory had to be defended in civil war. It took about three months, beginning with
    the victory over Kerensky near Gatchina, continued in the victories over the bourgeoisie, the
    officer cadets and part of the counter-revolutionary Cossacks in Moscow, lrkutsk, Orenburg
    and Kiev, and ending with the victory over Kaledin, Kornilov and Alexeyev at
    Restov-on-Don.
The fire of proletarian insurrection flared up in Finland, and the conflagration spread to
    Rumania.
Victories on the home front were achieved with relative ease since the enemy did not
    possess any material or organisational advantage, and, furthermore, did not have any sound
    economic basis or any support among the masses, the case with which these victories were
    gained was bound to turn the heads of many leaders, Their attitude has been:
    “We’ll have a walk-over.”
They have disregarded the widespread disintegration of the army, which is rapidly
    demobilising itself and abandoning the front. They have become intoxicated with revolutionary
    phrases. They have applied them to the struggle against world imperialism. They have mistaken
    Russia’s temporary “freedom” from imperialist pressure for something
    normal, although actually that “freedom” was due only to an interruption in the
    war between the German and Anglo-French plunderers, they have mistaken the mass strikes that
    are beginning in Austria and Germany for a revolution that is supposed to have delivered us
    from any serious danger from German imperialism. Instead of serious, effective, sustained
    work to aid the German revolution, which is coming to birth in a particularly difficult and
    painful manner, we have had people waving their arms—“what can those German
    imperialists do—with Liebknecht en our side we’ll kick them out in no
    time!”
The week from February 18 to February 24, 1918, from the capture of Dvinsk to the capture
    of Pskov (later recaptured), the week of imperialist Germany’s military offensive
    against the Soviet Socialist Republic, has been a bitter, distressing, and painful lessen,
    but it has been a necessary, useful and beneficial one. How highly instructive it has been to
    compare the two groups of telegraphic and telephonic communications that have reached the
    central government in the past week! On the one hand there has been the unrestrained flood of
    “resolution-type” revolutionary phrases—one might call them Steinberg
    phrases, if one recalls a chefd’oeuvre in that style, the speech of the
    “Left” (hm ... hm) Socialist-Revolutionary Steinberg at the Saturday meeting of
    the Central Executive Committee. On the other hand there have been the painful and
    humiliating reports of regiments refusing to retain their positions, of refusal to defend
    even the Narva Line, and of disobedience to the order to destroy everything in the event of a
    retreat, not to mention the running away, the chaos, ineptitude, helplessness and
    slovenliness.
A bitter, distressing, painful but necessary, useful and beneficial lesson!
The thoughtful, class-conscious worker will draw three conclusions from this historic
    lessen—on our attitude to the defence of the fatherland, its defence potential and to
    socialist revolutionary war; on the conditions under which we may come into collision with
    world imperialism; on the correct presentation of the question of our attitude to the world
    socialist movement.
We are and have been defencists since October 25, 1917, we champion the defence of the
    fatherland ever since that day. That is because we have shown by deeds that we have
    broken away from imperialism. We have denounced and published the filthy, bloodstained
    treaties of the imperialist plotters. We have overthrown our own bourgeoisie. We have given
    freedom to the peoples we formerly oppressed. We have given land to the people and
    introduced workers’ control. We are in favour of defending the Russian Soviet Socialist
    Republic.
And because we are in favour of defending the fatherland we demand a serious
    attitude towards the country’s defence potential and preparedness for war. We declare a
    ruthless war against revolutionary phrases about revolutionary war. There must be a lengthy,
    serious preparation for it, beginning with economic progress, the restoration of the railways
    (for without them modern warfare is an empty phrase) and with the establishment of the
    strictest revolutionary discipline and self-discipline everywhere.
From the point of view of the defence of the fatherland it would be a crime to enter into
    an armed conflict with an infinitely superior and well-prepared enemy when we obviously have
    no army. From the point of view of the defence of the fatherland we have to conclude the most
    harsh, oppressive, brutal, disgraceful peace—not in order to “capitulate”
    to imperialism but in order to learn and prepare to fight against imperialism in a serious
    and effective manner.
The past week has raised the Russian revolution to an immeasurably higher level of
    historical development. In the course of it history bas progressed, has ascended several
    steps at once.
Until now we have been faced with miserable, despicable (from the standpoint of world
    imperialism) enemies, an idiot called Romanov, Kerensky the boaster, gangs of officer cadets
    and bourgeois. Now there bas arisen against us the giant of world imperialism, a splendidly
    organised and technically well-equipped, civilised giant, that giant must be fought. And end
    must know how to fight him. A peasant country that has been subjected to
    unparalleled devastation by three years of war and that has begun the socialist revolution,
    must avoid armed conflicts-must avoid them while it is still possible, even at the cost of
    huge sacrifices-in order to be able to do something worthwhile before the “last,
    decisive battle” begins.
That battle will begin only when the socialist revolution breaks out in the leading
    imperialist countries. That revolution is undoubtedly maturating and growing stronger month
    by month, week by week. That growing strength must be helped. And we have to know how to help
    it. It would harm and not help that growing strength if we were to give up the neighbouring
    Soviet Socialist Republic to destruction at a moment when it obviously has no army.
We must not turn into an empty phrase the great slogan “We bank on the victory of
    socialism in Europe”. It is a true slogan if we have in mind the long and difficult
    path to the full victory of socialism. It is an indisputable philosophic-historical truth in
    respect of the entire “era of the socialist revolution”. But any abstract truth
    becomes an empty phrase if it is applied to any concrete situation. It is indisputable that
    “every strike conceals the hydra of the social revolution”. But it is nonsense to
    think that we can stride directly from a strike to the revolution. If we “bank en the
    victory of socialism in Europe” in the sense that we guarantee to the people that the
    European revolution will break out and is certain to be victorious within the next few weeks,
    certainly before the Germans have time to reach Petrograd, Moscow or Kiev, before they have
    time to “finish off” our railway transport, we shall be acting not as serious
    internationalist revolutionaries, but as adventurers.
If Liebknecht is victorious over the bourgeoisie in two or three weeks (it is not
    impossible), he will get us out of all difficulties. That is beyond doubt. If, however, we
    determine our tactics for today in the struggle against the imperialism of today in the hope
    that Liebknecht will probably be victorious within the next few weeks, we shall deserve
    nothing but ridicule. We shall be turning the greatest revolutionary slogans of the present
    day into an empty revolutionary phrase.
Worker comrades, learn from the painful but useful lessons of the revolution! Prepare
    seriously, vigorously and unwaveringly to defend the fatherland, to defend the Soviet
    Socialist Republic!

The Moscow Regional Bureau of our Party, in a
      resolution adopted on February 24, 1918, has expressed lack of
      confidence in the Central Committee, refused to obey those of
      its decisions "that will be connected with the implementation of
      the terms of the peace treaty with Austria and Germany”,
      and, in an "explanatory note" to the resolution, declared that
      it “considers a split in the Party in the very near future
      hardly avoidable”.[1]
There is nothing monstrous, nor even strange in all this. It is
      quite natural that comrades who sharply disagree with the
      Central Committee over the question of a separate peace should
      sharply condemn the Central Committee and express their
      conviction that a split is inevitable.  All that is the most
      legitimate right of Party members, which is quite
      understandable.
But here is what is strange and monstrous. An
      “explanatory note” is appended to the
      resolution. Here it is in full:
“The Moscow Regional Bureau considers a split in the Party in the very near future hardly avoidable, and it sets itself the aim of helping to unite all consistent revolutionary communists who equally oppose both the advocates of the conclusion of a separate peace and all moderate opportunists in the Party. In the interests of the world revolution, we consider it expedient to accept the possibility of losing Soviet power which is now becoming purely formal. We maintain as before that our primary task is to spread the ideas of the socialist revolution to all other countries and resolutely to promote the workers’ dictatorship, ruthlessly to suppress bourgeois counter-revolution in Russia.” 
    
It is the words we have stressed in this passage which are—strange and monstrous.
It is in these words that the crux of the matter lies.
These words reduce to an absurdity the whole line put forward by the authors of the
resolution. These words expose the root of their error with exceptional clarity.
“In the interests of the world revolution it is expedient to accept the possibility of losing Soviet power. . . .”  That is strange, for there is not even any connection between the premises and the conclusion. “In the interests of the world revolution it is expedient to accept the military defeat of Soviet power” —such a proposition might be right or wrong, but it could not be called strange. That is the first thing.
Second thing: Soviet power “is now becoming purely formal”. Now this is not only strange but  downright monstrous. Obviously, the authors have got themselves thoroughly entangled. We shall have to disentangle them.
As regards the first question, the authors’ idea evidently is that it would be expedient in
the interests of tho world revolution to accept the possibility of defeat in war, which would
lead to the loss of Soviet power, in other words, to the triumph of the bourgeoisie in Russia. By
voicing this idea the authors indirectly admit the truth of what I said in the theses (on January
8, 1918, published in Pravda on February 24, 1918),[2] namely, that refusal to accept the peace terms presented by Germany would lead to Russia’s defeat and the overthrow of Soviet power.
And so, la raison finit toujours par avoir raison— the truth always triumphs! My
“extremist" opponents, the Muscovites who threaten a split, have been obliged—just because they have got to the point of talking openly of a split—to be equally explicit about their real reasons, the reasons which people who confine themselves to general phrase-making about revolutionary war prefer to pass over in silence. The very essence of my theses and arguments (as anyone who cares to read attentively my theses of January 7, 1918, may see) is that we must accept this extremely harsh peace now, at once, while at the same time seriously preparing for a revolutionary war (and accept it, moreover, precisely in the interest of such serious preparations). Those who confined themselves to general phrase-making about a revolutionary war ignored or failed to notice, or did not want to notice, the very essence of my arguments. And now it is my “extremist” opponents, the Muscovites, whom I have to thank from the bottom of my heart for having broken the “conspiracy of silence” over the essence of my arguments. The Muscovites have been the first to reply to them.

And what is their reply?
Their reply is an admission of the correctness of my concrete argument. Yes, the
Muscovites have admitted, we shall certainly be defeated if we fight the Germans now.[3] Yes, this defeat would certainly lead to the fall of Soviet power.
Again and again I thank my “extremist” opponents, the Muscovites, from the bottom of my heart for having broken the “conspiracy of silence” against the essence of my arguments, i.e., against my concrete statement as to what the conditions of war would be, if we were to accept it at once, and for having fearlessly admitted the correctness of my concrete statement.
Further, on what grounds are my arguments, the substantial correctness of which the Muscovites
have been compelled to admit, rejected?
On the grounds that in the interests of the world revolution we must accept the loss
of Soviet power.
Why should the interests of the world revolution demand it? This is the crux of the matter;
this is the very essence of the reasoning of those who would like to defeat my arguments. And it
is on this, the most important, fundamental and vital point, that not a word is said, either in
the resolution or in the explanatory note. The authors of the resolution found time and space to
speak of what is universally known and indisputable—of “ruthlessly suppressing bourgeois
counter-revolution in Russia” (using the methods and means of a policy which would lead to the
loss of Soviet power?), and of opposing all moderate opportunists in the Party—but of that
which is really disputable and which concerns the very essence of the position of the opponents
of peace—not a word!
Strange. Extremely strange. Did the authors of the resolution keep silent about this because
they felt that on this point they were particularly weak? To have plainly stated why
(this is demanded by the interests of the world revolution) would most likely have meant exposing
themselves. . . .
However that may be, we have to seek out the arguments which may have guided
the authors of the resolution.
Perhaps the authors believe that the interests of the world revolution forbid making any peace
at all with imperialists? This opinion was expressed by some of the opponents of peace at one of
the Petrograd meetings, but only an insignificant minority of those who objected to a separate
peace supported it.[4] It is
clear that this opinion would lead to a denial of the expediency of the Brest negotiations and to
a rejection of peace, “even" if accompanied by the return of Poland, Latvia and Courland. The
incorrectness of this view (which was rejected, for example, by a majority of the Petrograd
opponents of peace) is as clear as day. A socialist republic surrounded by imperialist powers
could not, from this point of view, conclude any economic treaties, and could not exist at all,
without flying to the moon.
Perhaps the authors believe that the interests of the world revolution require that it should
be given a push, and that such a push can be given only by war, never by peace, which
might give the people the impression that imperialism was being “legitimised"? Such a “theory"
would be completely at variance with Marxism, for Marxism has always been opposed to “pushing"
revolutions, which develop with the growing acuteness of the class antagonisms that engender
revolutions. Such a theory would be tantamount to the view that armed uprising is a form of
struggle which is obligatory always and under all conditions. Actually, however, the interests of
the world revolution demand that Soviet power, having overthrown the bourgeoisie in our country,
should help that revolution, but that it should choose a form of help which is
commensurate with its own strength. To help the socialist revolution on an international scale by
accepting the possibility of defeat of that revolution in one’s own country is a view
that does not follow even from the “pushing” theory.
Perhaps the authors of the resolution believe that revolution has already begun in Germany and
has already reached the stage of an open, nation-wide civil war, that we must therefore devote
our strength to helping the German workers, and must perish ourselves ("losing Soviet power") to
save a German revolution which has already started its decisive fight and is being hard
pressed? According to this theory, we, while perishing ourselves, would be diverting part of the
forces of German counter-revolution, thereby saving the German revolution.
It is quite conceivable that, given these premises, it would not only be “expedient” (as the
authors of the resolution put it) but a downright duty to accept the possibility of
defeat and the possibility of the loss of Soviet power. But obviously these premises do not
exist. The German revolution is ripening, but it has obviously not reached the stage of an
explosion in Germany, of civil war in Germany. By “accepting the possibility of losing Soviet
power", we certainly would not be helping the German revolution to reach maturity, but would
be hindering it. We would be helping German reaction, playing into its hands, hampering the
socialist movement in Germany and frightening away from socialism large masses of German
proletarians and semi-proletarians who have not yet come over to socialism and would be scared by
the defeat of Soviet Russia, just as the British workers were scared by the defeat of the Paris
Commune in 1871.
Twist and turn them how you will, but you can find no logic in the authors’ contentions. There
are no sensible arguments to support the view that “in the interests of the world revolution it
is expedient to accept the possibility of losing Soviet power”.
"Soviet power is now becoming purely formal"—this, as we see, is the monstrous view the
authors of the Moscow resolution have come to proclaim.
Since the German imperialists are going to make us pay indemnities and forbid us to carry on
propaganda and agitation against Germany, Soviet power loses all significance and “becomes purely
formal"—this is probably the line of “reasoning” of the authors of the resolution. We say
"probably", for the authors offer nothing clear and specific in support of their thesis.
Profound and hopeless pessimism and complete despair—such is the sum and substance of the
"theory” that the significance of Soviet power is purely formal, and that tactics which will risk
the possible loss of Soviet power are permissible. Since there is no salvation anyway, then let
even Soviet power perish—such is the sentiment that dictated this monstrous resolution. The
allegedly “economic” arguments in which such ideas are sometimes clothed reveal the same hopeless
pessimism: what sort of Soviet republic is it—the implication is—when not just
tribute, but tribute on such a scale can be exacted from it?
Nothing but despair: we shall perish anyhow!
It is a quite understandable mood in the extremely desperate situation in which Russia finds
herself. But it is not “understandable” among conscious revolutionaries. The typical thing about
it is that here we have the views of the Muscovites reduced to absurdity. The Frenchmen of 1793
would never have said that their gains —the republic and democracy—were becoming
purely formal and that they would have to accept the possibility of losing the republic. They
were not filled with despair, but with faith in victory. To call for a revolutionary war, and at
the same time to talk in an official resolution of “accepting the possibility of losing Soviet
power", is to expose oneself completely.
Early in the nineteenth century, at the time of the Napoleonic wars, Prussia and a number of
other countries suffered incomparably and immeasurably greater hardships and burdens of defeat,
conquest, humiliation and oppression on the part of the conqueror than Russia is suffering in
1918. Yet the best men of Prussia, when Napoleon’s military jack boots trampled upon them a
hundred times more heavily than we can be trampled upon now, did not despair, and did not say
that their national political institutions were “purely formal”. They did not give up, did not
succumb to the feeling: “We shall perish anyhow.” They signed peace treaties infinitely more
drastic, brutal, humiliating and oppressive than the Brest Treaty, and then knew how to bide
their time; they staunchly bore the conqueror’s yoke, fought again, fell under the conqueror’s
yoke again, again signed the vilest of vile peace treaties, and again rose, and in the end
liberated themselves (not without exploiting the dissensions among the stronger competing
conquerors).
Why shouldn’t this be repeated in our history?
Why should we give way to despair and write resolutions—which, by heavens, are more
disgraceful than the most disgraceful peace—saying that “Soviet power is becoming purely
formal"?
Why shouldn’t the most crushing military defeats in the struggle against the giants of modern
imperialism steel the national character in Russia, too, strengthen self-discipline, put an end
to the bragging and phrase-making, teach fortitude and bring the people round to the correct
tactics of the Prussians when they were crushed by Napoleon—the tactics of signing the most
humiliating of peace treaties when you haven’t an army, then mustering your forces and rising
again and again?
Why should we give way to despair at the first peace treaty, incredibly harsh though it be,
when other nations were able staunchly to bear even bitterer misfortunes?
Is it the staunchness of the proletarian who knows that one must submit when strength is
lacking, and is then nevertheless is able to rise again and again at any price and to build up
strength under all circumstances, that corresponds to these tactics of despair, or,
rather, the spinelessness of the petty bourgeois, who in our country, in the shape of the Left
Socialist-Revolutionary Party, has beaten the record for phrase-making about a revolutionary
war?
No, dear Moscow “extremist” comrades, every day of trial will drive away from you those very
workers who are the most class-conscious and the staunchest. Soviet power, they will say, is not
becoming, and will not become, purely formal; and not only now, when the
conqueror is in Pskov and is making us pay a ten-thousand-million-ruble tribute in grain, ore and
money, but even if he gets as far as Nizhni-Novgorod and Rostov-on-Don and makes us pay a tribute
of twenty thousand million rubles.
Never will any foreign conquest render a popular political institution “purely formal” (and
Soviet power is not only a political institution far and away superior to any thing
known to history). On the contrary, alien conquest will only strengthen popular sympathy for
Soviet power, provided—provided it does not indulge in reckless follies.
And to refuse to conclude even the vilest peace when you have no army would be a reckless
gamble, for which the people would be justified in condemning the government that refused to do
so.
Immensely more harsh and humiliating peace treaties than the Brest Treaty have been signed
before in history (we gave some instances above) without discrediting the regime or turning it
into a formality; they ruined neither the regime nor the people, but rather steeled the people,
taught them the stern and difficult science of building up an effective army even in the
most desperate conditions and under the heel of the conqueror.
Russia is making for a new and genuine patriotic war, a war for the preservation and
consolidation of Soviet power. It is possible that another epoch will—like the epoch of the
Napoleonic wars—be an epoch of liberation wars (not one war, but wars) imposed by
aggressors upon Soviet Russia. That is possible.
And, therefore, more humiliating than any harsh or even extremely harsh peace, rendered
imperative owing to the lack of an army—more humiliating than any humiliating peace is
humiliating despair. We shall not perish even from a dozen obnoxious peace treaties if we take
revolt and war seriously. No conquerors can destroy us if we do not destroy ourselves by
despair and phrase-making.

Further more, the Moscow Regional Bureau does not consider itself bound to obey unreservedly those decisions of the Central Committee that will be connected with the implementation of the terms of the peace treaty with Austria and Germany.” The resolution was adopted unanimously.

[3]  As to the
counter-argument, that to avoid fighting was anyway impossible, the reply has been given by the
facts: On January 8 my theses were read; by January 15 we might have had peace. A
respite would have been certainly assured (and for us even the briefest respite would have been
of gigantic significance, both materially and morally, for the Germans would have had to
declare a new war), if . . . if it had not been for revolutionary phrase-making.
[4] This refers to the voting on the
question of peace with Germany at a meeting of the Party Central Committee representing various
trends in the Party on January 21 (February 3), 1918. Two “Left Communists", Osinsky (Obolensky) and Stukov, voted against any possibility of peace between socialist and imperialist countries. The majority of the “Left Communists", however, took an ambivalent stand. While admitting the possibility of peace being concluded between socialist and imperialist states, they voted against the immediate conclusion of peace with Germany (see Minutes of the Central Committee of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.), August 1917 to February 1918, 1958, pp. 190-91).

      Thou art wretched, thou art abundant,
      Thou art mighty, thou art impotent
      — Mother Russia![2]

Human history these days is making a momentous and
    most difficult turn, a turn, one might say without the least
    exaggeration, of immense significance for the emancipation of the
    world. A turn from war to peace; a turn from a war between
    plunderers who are sending to the shambles millions of the working
    and exploited people for the sake of establishing a new system of
    dividing the spoils looted by the strongest of them, to a war of
    the oppressed against the oppressors for liberation from the yoke
    of capital; a turn from an abyss of suffering, anguish, starvation
    and degradation to the bright future of communist society,
    universal prosperity and enduring peace. No wonder that at the
    sharpest points of this sharp turn, when all around the old order
    is breaking down and collapsing with a terrible grinding crash,
    and the new order is being born amid indescribable suffering,
    there are some whose heads grow dizzy, some who are seized by
    despair, some who seek salvation from the at times too bitter
    reality in fine-sounding and alluring phrases. 

    
      It has been Russia’s lot to see most clearly, and
      experience most keenly and painfully the sharpest of sharp
      turning-points in history as it swings round from imperialism
      towards the communist revolution. In the space of a few days we
      destroyed one of the oldest, most powerful, barbarous and brutal
      of monarchies. In the space of a few months we passed through a
      number of stages of collaboration with the bourgeoisie and of
      shaking off petty-bourgeois illusions, for which other countries
      have required decades. In the course of a few weeks, having
      overthrown the bourgeoisie, we crushed its open resistance in
      civil war. We passed in a victorious triumphal march of
      Bolshevism from one end of a vast country to the other. We
      raised the lowest strata of the working people oppressed by
      tsarism and the bourgeoisie to liberty and independent life. We
      established and consolidated a Soviet Republic, a new type of
      state, which is infinitely superior to, and more democratic
      than, the best of the bourgeois-parliamentary republics. We
      established the dictatorship of the proletariat supported by the
      poor peasantry, and began a broadly conceived system of
      socialist reforms. We awakened the faith of the millions upon
      millions of workers of all countries in their own strength and
      kindled the fires of enthusiasm in them. Everywhere we issued
      the call for a world workers’ revolution. We flung a
      challenge to the imperialist plunderers of all countries. 

    
      Then in a few days we were thrown to the ground by an
      imperialist plunderer, who fell upon the unarmed. He compelled
      us to sign an incredibly burdensome and humiliating
      peace—as tribute for having dared to tear ourselves, even
      for the shortest space of time, from the iron clutches of an
      imperialist war. The more ominously the shadow of a
      workers’ revolution in his own country rises before the
      plunderer, the greater his ferocity in crushing and stifling
      Russia and tearing her to pieces. 

    
      We were compelled to sign a “Tilsit”peace. We need
      no self-deception. We must courageously look the bitter,
      unadorned truth straight in the face. We must measure fully, to
      the very bottom, that abyss of defeat, dismemberment,
      enslavement, and humiliation into which we have now been
      pushed. The more clearly we understand this, the firmer, the
      more steeled and tempered will be our will to liberation, our
      aspiration to rise again from enslavement to independence, and
      our unbending determination to ensure that at any price Russia
      ceases to be wretched and impotent and becomes mighty and
      abundant in the full meaning of these words. 

    
      And mighty and abundant she can become, for, after all, we still
      have sufficient territory and natural wealth left to us to
      supply each and all, if not with abundant, at least with
      adequate means, of life. Our natural wealth, our manpower and
      the splendid impetus which the great revolution has given to the
      creative powers of the people are ample material to build a
      truly mighty and abundant Russia. 

    
      Russia will become mighty and abundant if she abandons all
      dejection and all phrase-making, if, with clenched teeth, she
      musters all her forces and strains every nerve and muscle, if
      she realises that salvation lies only along that road
      of world socialist revolution upon which we have set out. March
      forward along that road, undismayed by defeats, lay the firm
      foundation of socialist society stone by stone, work with might
      and main to establish discipline and self-discipline,
      consolidate everywhere organisation, order, efficiency, and the
      harmonious co-operation of all the forces of the people,
      introduce comprehensive accounting of and control over
      production and distribution—such is the way to build up
      military might and socialist might. 

    
      It would be unworthy of a genuine socialist who has suffered
      grave defeat either to bluster or to give way to despair. It is
      not true that our position is hopeless and that all that remains
      for us is to choose between an “inglorious”death
      (inglorious from the point of view of the szlaczcic ),
      such as this harsh peace represents, and a
      “gallant”death in a hopeless fight. It is not true
      that by signing a “Tilsit”peace we have betrayed our
      ideals or our friends. We have betrayed nothing and nobody, we
      have not sanctified or covered up any lie, we have not refused
      to help a single friend or comrade in misfortune in every way we
      could and with everything at our disposal. A general who
      withdraws the remnants of his army into the heart of the country
      when it has been beaten or is in panic-stricken flight, or who,
      in extremity, shields this retreat by a harsh and humiliating
      peace, is not guilty of treachery towards that part of his army
      which he is powerless to help and which has been cut off by the
      enemy. Such a general performs his duty by choosing the only way
      of saving what can still be saved, by refusing to gamble
      recklessly, by not embellishing the bitter truth for the people,
      by “surrendering space in order to gain time”, by
      taking advantage of any and every respite, even the
      briefest, in which to muster his forces and to allow his army to
      rest or recover, if it is affected by disintegration and
      demoralisation. 

    
      We have signed a “Tilsit”peace. When Napoleon I, in
      1807, compelled Prussia to sign the Peace of Tilsit, the
      conqueror smashed the Germans’ entire army, occupied their
      capital and all their big cities, brought in his own police,
      compelled the vanquished to supply him, the conqueror, with
      auxiliary corps for fresh predatory wars, and partitioned
      Germany, concluding alliances with some German states against
      others. Nevertheless, the German people survived even
      such a peace, proved able to muster their forces, to
      rise and to win the right to liberty and independence. 

    
      To all those who are able and willing to think, the example of
      the Peace of Tilsit (which was only one of many harsh and
      humiliating treaties forced upon the Germans at that period)
      clearly shows how childishly naïve is the idea that under
      all conditions a harsh peace means the bottomless pit of ruin,
      while war is the path of valour and salvation. Periods of war
      teach us that peace has not infrequently in history served as a
      respite and a means of mustering forces for new battles. The
      Peace of Tilsit was a supreme humiliation for Germany, but at
      the same time it marked a turn towards a supreme national
      resurgence. At that time historical conditions were such that
      this resurgence could be channelled only in the direction of a
      bourgeois state. At that time, more than a hundred
      years ago, history was made by handfuls of nobles and a
      sprinkling of bourgeois intellectuals, while the worker and
      peasant masses were somnolent and dormant. As a result history
      at that time could only crawl along at a terribly slow pace. 

    
      But now capitalism has raised culture in general, and the
      culture of the masses in particular, to a much higher level. War
      has shaken up the masses, its untold horrors and suffering have
      awakened them. War has given history momentum and it is now
      flying with locomotive speed. History is now being independently
      made by millions and tens of millions of people. Capitalism has
      now matured for socialism. 

    
      Consequently, if Russia is now passing—as she undeniably
      is—from a “Tilsit”peace to a national
      resurgence, to a great patriotic war, the outlet for it is not
      in the direction of a bourgeois state, but in the direction of a
      world socialist revolution. Since October 25, 1917, we have been
      defencists. 

      We are for “defence of the fatherland”; but that
      patriotic war towards which we are moving is a war for a
      socialist fatherland, for socialism as a fatherland, for the
      Soviet Republic as a contingent of the world army of socialism. 

    
      “Hate the Germans, kill the Germans”— such
      was, and is, the slogan of common, i. e., bourgeois,
      patriotism. But we will say “Hate the imperialist
      plunderers, hate capitalism, death to capitalism”and at
      the same time “Learn from the Germans! Remain true to the
      brotherly alliance with the German workers. They are late in
      coming to our aid. We shall gain time, we shall live to see them
      coming, and they will come, to our aid.”

    
      Yes, learn from the Germans! History is moving in zig-zags and
      by roundabout ways. It so happens that it is the Germans who now
      personify, besides a brutal imperialism, the principle of
      discipline, organisation, harmonious co-operation on the basis
      of modern machine industry, and strict accounting and control. 

    
      And that is just what we are lacking. That is just what we must
      learn. That is just what our great revolution needs in order to
      pass from a triumphant beginning, through a succession of severe
      trials, to its triumphant goal. That is just what the Russian
      Soviet Socialist Republic requires in order to cease being
      wretched and impotent and become mighty and abundant for all
      time.

      Draft Resolution On Wilson’s Message[2]

 
      The Congress expresses its gratitude to the American people, and
      primarily to the working and exploited classes of the United
      States of America, in connection with President Wilson’s
      expression of his sympathy for the Russian people through the
      Congress of Soviets at a time when the Soviet Socialist Republic
      of Russia is passing through severe trials.   

    
      The Russian Soviet
      Republic, having become a neutral country, takes advantage of
      the message received from President Wilson to express to all
      peoples that are perishing and suffering from the horrors of the
      imperialist war its profound sympathy and firm conviction that
      the happy time is not far away when the working people of all
      bourgeois countries will throw off the yoke of capital and
      establish the socialist system of society, the only system able
      to ensure a durable and just peace and also culture and
      well-being for all working people.

 Report On Ratification Of The Peace Treaty March 14
 
      Comrades, today we have to settle a question that marks a
      turning-point in the development of the Russian revolution, and
      not only of the Russian but also of the international
      revolution, and in order to decide correctly on this very harsh
      peace which representatives of Soviet power have concluded at
      Brest-Litovsk, and which Soviet power asks you to approve, or
      ratify—in order to settle this question correctly it is
      more than ever necessary for us to get an understanding of the
      historical meaning of the turning-point we are at, an
      understanding of the main feature of the development of the
      revolution up to now and the main reason for the severe defeat
      and the period of stern trials we have passed through. 

    
      It seems to me that the chief source of disagreement among the
      Soviet parties [3]
      on this question is that some people too easily give way to a
      feeling of just and legitimate indignation over the defeat of
      the Soviet Republic by imperialism, too easily give way at times
      to despair instead of considering the historical conditions of
      the revolution as they developed up to the time of the present
      peace, and as they appear to us since the peace; instead of
      doing that they try to answer questions of the tactics of the
      revolution on the basis of their immediate feelings. The entire
      history of revolutions, however, teaches us that when we have to
      do with a mass movement or with the class struggle, especially
      one like that at present developing not only throughout a single
      country, albeit a tremendous country, but also involving all
      international relations—in such a case we must base our
      tactics first and foremost on an appraisal of the objective
      situation, we must examine analytically the course of the
      revolution up to this moment and the reason it has taken a turn
      so menacing and so sharp, and so much to our disadvantage. 

     
      If we examine the development of our revolution from that point
      of view we see clearly that it has so far passed through a
      period of relative and largely imaginary self-dependence, and of
      being temporarily independent of international relations. The
      path travelled by our revolution from the end of February 1917
      to February 11 of this year, [4] when the German offensive began, was,
      by and large, a path of easy and rapid successes. If we study
      the development of that revolution on an international scale,
      from the standpoint of the Russian revolution alone, we shall
      see that we have passed through three periods in the past
      year. The first period is that in which the working class of
      Russia, together with all advanced, class-conscious and active
      peasants, supported not only by the petty bourgeoisie but also
      by the big bourgeoisie, swept away the monarchy in a few
      days. This astounding success is to be explained by the fact
      that on the one hand, the Russian people had acquired a big
      reserve of revolutionary fighting potential from the experience
      of 1905, while on the other hand, Russia, an extremely backward
      country, had suffered more than any other from the war and had,
      at an especially early date, reached a stage when it was
      absolutely impossible to continue the war under the old regime. 

     
      This short tempestuous success when a new organisation was
      created—the Soviets of Workers’, Soldiers’ and
      Peasants’ Deputies—was followed by the long months
      of the period of transition of our revolution, the period in
      which the government of the bourgeoisie, immediately undermined
      by the Soviets, was kept going and strengthened by the petty
      bourgeois compromising parties, the Mensheviks and
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, who supported it. It was a government
      that supported the imperialist war and the imperialist secret
      treaties, fed the working class on promises, did literally
      nothing, and preserved the state of economic ruin. The Soviets
      mustered their forces in this period, a period that for us, for
      the Russian revolution, was a long one; it was a long period for
      the Russian revolution but it was a short one from the
      international point of view, because in most of the leading
      countries the period of overcoming petty-bourgeois illusions, of
      compromise by various parties, groups and trends had been taking
      not months but long decades. The span of time, from April 20 to
      the moment Kerensky renewed the imperialist war in June (he had
      the secret imperialist treaty in his pocket), was decisive. This
      second period included our July defeat and the Kornilov revolt,
      and only through the experience of the mass struggle, only when
      the working-class and peasant masses had realised from their own
      experience and not from sermons that petty-bourgeois compromise
      was all in vain—only then, after long political
      development, after long preparations and changes in the moods
      and views of party groups, was the ground made ready for the
      October Revolution; only then did the Russian revolution enter
      the third period of its initial stage, a stage of isolation, or
      temporary separation, from the world revolution. 

     
      This third, or October, period, the period of organisation, was
      the most difficult; at the same time it was a period of the
      biggest and most rapid triumphs. After October, our
      revolution—the revolution that placed power in the hands
      of the revolutionary proletariat, established its dictatorship
      and obtained for it the support of the vast majority of the
      proletariat and the poor peasantry—after October our
      revolution made a victorious, triumphal advance. Throughout
      Russia civil war began in the form of resistance by the
      exploiters, the landowners and bourgeoisie, supported by part of
      the imperialist bourgeoisie. 

     
      Civil war broke out, and in that war the forces of the enemies
      of Soviet power, the forces of the enemies of the working and
      exploited masses, proved to be insignificant; the civil war was
      one continuous triumph for Soviet power because its opponents,
      the exploiters, the landowners and bourgeoisie, had neither
      political nor economic support, and their attacks collapsed. The
      struggle against them was not so much a military operation as
      agitation; section after section, mass after mass, down to the
      working Cossacks, abandoned the exploiters who were trying to
      lead them away from Soviet power. 

     
      This period of the victorious, triumphal advance of the
      dictatorship of the proletariat and Soviet power, when great
      masses of the working and exploited people of Russia were drawn
      to the side of Soviet power definitely and irrevocably—
      this period constituted the final and highest point of
      development of the Russian revolution, which had been
      progressing all this time, apparently, independently of world
      imperialism. That was the reason why a country which was
      extremely backward and was the most prepared for the revolution
      by the experience of 1905 was able to promote one class after
      another to power rapidly, easily and systematically, getting rid
      of various political alignments until at last that political
      structure was reached which was the last word, not only in the
      Russian revolution, but also in the West-European workers’
      revolutions, for Soviet power has been consolidated in Russia
      and has won the absolute sympathy of the working and exploited
      people because it has destroyed the old state apparatus that was
      an instrument of oppression and has laid the foundation of a
      state of a new and higher form of which the Paris Commune was
      the prototype. The Commune destroyed the old state machine and
      replaced it by the armed force of the masses themselves,
      replaced bourgeois parliamentary democracy by the democracy of
      the working people, which excluded the exploiters and
      systematically suppressed their resistance. 

     
      That is what the Russian revolution did in this period and that
      is why a small vanguard of the Russian revolution is under the
      impression that this rapid triumphal advance can be expected to
      continue in further victory. That is precisely their mistake
      because the period when the Russian revolution was developing,
      passing state power in Russia from one class to another and
      getting rid of class compromise within the bounds of Russia
      alone—this period-was able to exist historically only
      because the predatory giants of world imperialism were
      temporarily halted in their advance against Soviet power. A
      revolution that overthrew the monarchy in a few days, exhausted
      all possibilities of compromise with the bourgeoisie in a few
      months and overcame all the resistance by the bourgeoisie in a
      civil war of a few weeks, this revolution, the revolution of a
      socialist republic, could live side by side with the imperialist
      powers, among the international plunderers, the wild beasts of
      international imperialism, only so long as the bourgeoisie,
      locked in mortal struggle with each other, were paralysed in
      their offensive against Russia. 

     
      And then began the period that we feel so keenly and see before
      our eyes, the period of disastrous defeats and severe trials for
      the Russian revolution, the period in which the swift, direct
      and open offensive against the enemies of the revolution is over
      while in its place we are experiencing disastrous defeats and
      have to retreat before forces that are immeasurably greater than
      ours, before the forces of international imperialism and finance
      capital, before the military might that the entire bourgeoisie
      with its modern weapons and its organisation has mustered
      against us in the interests of plunder, oppression and the
      strangling of small nations; we had to think of bringing our
      forces up to their level; we had to face a task of tremendous
      difficulty, that of direct combat with enemies that differed
      from Romanov and Kerensky who could not be taken seriously; we
      had to meet the forces of the international imperialist
      bourgeoisie, all its military might, we had to stand face to
      face with the world plunderers. In view of the delay in getting
      help from the international socialist proletariat we naturally
      had to take upon ourselves a conflict with these forces and we
      suffered a disastrous defeat. 

     
      And this epoch is one of disastrous defeats, an epoch of
      retreat, an epoch in which we must save at least a small part of
      our position by retreating before imperialism, by awaiting the
      time when there will be changes in the world situation in
      general, when the forces of the European proletariat arrive, the
      forces that exist and are maturing but which have not been able
      to deal with their enemy as easily as we did with ours; it would
      be a very great illusion, a very great mistake, to forget that
      it was easy for the Russian revolution to begin but difficult
      for it to take further steps. This was inevitable because we had
      to begin with the most backward and most rotten political
      system. The European revolution will have to begin against the
      bourgeoisie, against a much more serious enemy and under
      immeasurably more difficult conditions. It will be much more
      difficult for the European revolution to begin. We see that it
      is immeasurably more difficult to make the first breach in the
      system that is holding back the revolution. It will be much
      easier for the European revolution to advance to the second and
      third stages. Things cannot be different with the alignment of
      forces of the revolutionary and reactionary classes that at
      present obtains in the world. This is the main turn in events
      that is always overlooked by people who view the present
      situation, the extremely serious position of the revolution,
      from the stand point of their own feelings and their
      indignation, and not from the historical standpoint. Historical
      experience teaches us that always, in all revolutions, at a time
      when a revolution takes an abrupt turn from swift victory to
      severe defeats, there comes a period of pseudo-revolutionary
      phrase-making that invariably causes the greatest damage to the
      development of the revolution. And so, comrades, we shall be
      able to appraise our tactics correctly only when we set out to
      consider the turn in events that has hurled us back from swift,
      easy and complete victories to grave defeats. This is an
      extremely difficult and extremely serious question arising out
      of the present turning-point in the development of the
      revolution, the turn from easy victories within the country to
      exceptionally heavy defeats without; it is also a turning-point
      in the entire world revolution, a turn from the period of
      propaganda and agitation on the part of the Russian revolution,
      with imperialism biding its time, to the offensive of
      imperialism against Soviet power, and this turn puts a
      particularly difficult and acute question before the
      international movement in Western Europe. If we are not to
      ignore this historical aspect of the situation we must try to
      understand how Russia’s basic interests in the question of
      the present harsh, or obscene, as it is called, peace took
      shape. 

     
      When arguing against those who refused to see the need to accept
      that peace, I have often come up against the statement that the
      idea of concluding the peace expresses only the interests of the
      exhausted peasant masses, the declassed soldiers, and so on and
      so forth. Whenever I hear such statements, whenever I hear such
      things referred to, I am always amazed that the class aspect of
      national development is forgotten by comrades—people who
      limit themselves exclusively to seeking explanations. As though
      the Party of the proletariat on taking power had not counted on
      the alliance of the proletariat and the semi-proletariat, i. e.,
      the-poor peasantry (i. e., the majority of the peasantry of
      Russia), had not known that only such an alliance would be able
      to hand the government of Russia over to the revolutionary power
      of the Soviets, the power of the majority, the real majority of
      the people, and that without this alliance it would be senseless
      to make any attempt to establish power, especially at difficult
      turning-points in history! As though we could now abandon this
      verity that was accepted by all of us and confine ourselves to a
      contemptuous reference to the exhausted state of the peasantry
      and the declassed soldiers! With regard to the exhausted state
      of the peasantry and the declassed soldiers we must say that the
      country will offer resistance, and that the poor peasants will
      be able to offer resistance only in so far as those poor
      peasants are capable of directing their forces to the struggle. 

     
      When we were about to take power in October it was obvious that
      events were inevitably leading up to it, that the turn towards
      Bolshevism in the Soviets indicated a turn throughout the
      country, and that the Bolsheviks must inevitably take
      power. When we, realising this, took power in October, we said
      to ourselves and to all the people, very clearly and
      unequivocally, that it was a transfer of power to the
      proletariat and the poor peasantry, that the proletariat knew
      the peasantry would support it—you know yourselves in
      what—in its active struggle for peace and its readiness to
      continue the fight against big finance capital. In this we are
      making no mistake, and nobody who sticks to the concept of class
      forces and class alignments can get away from the indisputable
      truth that we cannot ask a country of small peasants, a country
      that has given much for the European and world revolution, to
      carry on the struggle in a difficult situation, a most difficult
      situation, when help from the West-European proletariat has
      undoubtedly been delayed, although there is no doubt that it is
      coming to us, as the facts, the strikes, etc., show. That is why
      I say that such references to the exhaustion of the peasant
      masses, etc., are made by people who simply have no arguments,
      who are absolutely helpless when they seek such arguments, and
      who are quite unable to grasp class relations as a whole, in
      their entirety, the relations of the revolution of the
      proletariat and of the peasant masses; it is only when, at every
      sharp turn in history, we appraise the class relations as a
      whole, the relations of all classes, and do not select
      individual examples and individual cases, that we feel ourselves
      firmly supported by an analysis of probable facts. I realise
      full well that the Russian bourgeoisie are today urging us on
      towards a revolutionary war when it is absolutely impossible for
      us to have such a war. This is essential to the class interests
      of the bourgeoisie. 

     
      When they shout about an obscene peace and do not say a word
      about who brought the army to its present state, I realise quite
      well that it is the bourgeoisie together with the Dyelo
      Naroda people, the Tsereteli and Chernov Mensheviks and
      their yes-men (applause )—I know quite well that
      it is the bourgeoisie who are bawling for a revolutionary
      war. Their class interests demand it, their anxiety to see
      Soviet power make a false move demands it. It is not surprising
      that this comes from people who, on the one hand, fill the pages
      of their newspapers with counter-revolutionary
      scribbling. . . . (Voices : “They’ve all
      been suppressed!”) Unfortunately, not yet all of them, but
      we will close them all down. (Applause.) I should like
      to see the proletariat that would allow the
      counter-revolutionaries, those who support the bourgeoisie and
      collaborate with them, to continue using the monopoly of wealth
      to drug the people with their bourgeois opium. There is no such
      proletariat. (Applause.) 

     
      I realise, of course, that nothing but shouts, howls and screams
      about an obscene peace comes from those publications, I realise
      full well that the people who favour this revolutionary
      war—from the Constitutional-Democrats to the Right
      Socialist-Revolutionaries—are those who meet the Germans
      as they advance and say triumphantly, here come the Germans, and
      then allow their officers, again wearing their badges of rank,
      to strut about in the places that have been occupied by the
      German imperialist invaders. Oh no, I am not a bit surprised at
      these bourgeois, these collaborators, preaching a revolutionary
      war. They want Soviet power to be caught in a trap. They have
      shown their hand, these bourgeois and collaborators. We have
      seen them and can still see live specimens, we know that in the
      Ukraine there are Ukrainian Kerenskys, Ukrainian Chernovs and
      Ukrainian Tseretelis—there they are, the
      Vinnichenkos. Those gentlemen, the Ukrainian Kerenskys, Chernovs
      and Tseretelis, concealed from the people the peace they
      concluded with the German imperialists, and today they are
      trying to overthrow Soviet power in the Ukraine with the help of
      German bayonets. That is what those bourgeois and those
      collaborators and their accomplices have done. That is what they
      have done, those Ukrainian bourgeois and collaborators, whose
      example you have before your very eyes; they concealed and are
      still concealing their secret treaties from the people, they are
      attacking Soviet power with the aid of German bayonets. That is
      what the Russian bourgeoisie want, that is where the bourgeois
      yes-men are trying to push Soviet power, wittingly or
      unwittingly; they know that under no circumstances can Soviet
      power undertake an imperialist war against the might of
      imperialism at the present moment. That is why it is only in
      this international situation, in this general class situation,
      that we can understand the full depth of the mistake of those
      who, like the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party, have allowed
      themselves to be carried away by a theory that is common to the
      history of all revolutions at moments of difficulty, a theory
      that is half desperation and half empty phrases; according to
      this theory, instead of taking a sober view of reality and
      appraising the tasks of the revolution in respect of the
      internal and external enemy from the standpoint of class forces,
      you are asked to settle a serious and very grave problem only
      under the impact of your feelings, merely from  standpoint of
      feelings. The peace is incredibly harsh and shameful. ln my
      statements and speeches I have had occasion to liken it to the
      Peace of Tilsit that the conqueror Napoleon forced on the
      Prussian and German peoples after a series of heavy
      defeats. Yes, the peace is a grave defeat and is humiliating to
      Soviet power, but if you, proceeding from this, and limiting
      yourselves to it, appeal to feelings and arouse discontent in an
      attempt to settle a gigantic historical problem, you will get
      into that ridiculous and pitiful situation into which the
      Socialist-Revolutionary Party once got itself, when in 1907, in
      a situation that was somewhat similar in certain respects, that
      party also appealed to the feelings of revolutionaries, when,
      after our revolution had suffered heavy defeats in 1906 and
      1907, Stolypin presented us with the laws on the Third
      Duma—shameful and extremely difficult conditions of work
      in one of the rottenest of representative
      institutions—when our Party, after brief internal wavering
      (the wavering on the question was greater than it is today),
      decided the question in this way: we have no right to give way
      to feelings; no matter how great our indignation and
      dissatisfaction with the shameful Third Duma, we have to
      recognise that it was not chance but the historical necessity of
      a developing class struggle which lacked the strength to
      continue but which could muster that strength even in the
      shameful conditions that have been imposed. We proved to be
      right. Those who tried to attract people by revolutionary
      phrases, by appeals to justice (since they were expressing
      feelings that were trebly legitimate)—those people were
      given a lesson that will not be forgotten by any revolutionary
      capable of thought and possessing ideas. 

     
      Revolutions do not go smoothly enough to ensure rapid and easy
      progress. There has never been any great revolution, even on a
      national scale, that did not experience a hard period of defeat,
      and the attitude of a revolutionary towards the serious question
      of mass movements, of developing revolutions, must not be one of
      declaring the peace obscene and humiliating and then saying he
      cannot reconcile himself to it; it is not sufficient to quote
      agitational phrases, to shower reproaches on us because of the
      peace—that is the known ABC of the revolution, the
      experience of all revolutions. Our experience since
      1905—and if we are rich in anything, if there is any
      reason why the Russian working class and poor peasantry have
      taken upon themselves the most difficult and honourable task of
      beginning the world socialist revolution, it is because the
      Russian people have been able, owing to specific historical
      conditions, to make two great revolutions at the beginning of
      the twentieth century—we have to learn from the experience
      of those revolutions, we have to learn to understand that only
      by studying the changes in the class connections between one
      country and another is it possible to prove definitely that we
      are in no condition to accept battle at the moment; we have to
      take this into consideration and say to ourselves, whatever
      respite we may obtain, no matter how unstable, no matter how
      brief, harsh and humiliating the peace may be, it is better than
      war, because it gives the masses a breathing-space, because it
      provides us with an opportunity to correct what the bourgeoisie
      have done, the bourgeoisie that are shouting wherever they have
      an opportunity to shout, especially under the protection of the
      Germans in the occupied regions. 

     
      The bourgeoisie are shouting that the Bolsheviks are responsible
      for the disintegration of the army, that there is no army and
      the Bolsheviks are to blame for it; but let us look at the past,
      comrades, let us look, firstly, at the development of our
      revolution. Do you not know that desertion and the
      disintegration of our army began long before the revolution, in
      1916, and that everybody who has seen the army will have to
      admit that? And what did our bourgeoisie do to prevent it? Is it
      not clear that the only chance for salvation from the
      imperialists at that time was in their hands, that a chance
      presented itself in March and April, when Soviet organisations
      could have taken power by a simple motion of the hand against
      the bourgeoisie. And if the Soviets had then taken power, if the
      bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intelligentsia, together with the
      Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, instead of helping
      Kerensky deceive the people, conceal the secret treaties and
      lead the army to an offensive—if they had then come to the
      aid of the army, had supplied it with munitions and rations and
      had compelled the bourgeoisie to help the fatherland—not
      the fatherland of the hucksters, not the fatherland of treaties
      that help to slaughter the people (applause )—and
      had themselves participated; if the Soviets had forced the
      bourgeoisie to help the fatherland of the workers and all
      working people, and had helped the ragged, barefoot and hungry
      army, then, perhaps, we should have had a period of ten months,
      long enough to rest the army and gain unanimous support for it,
      so that without the army having moved one step from the front a
      general, democratic peace could have been proposed, the secret
      treaties could have been torn up and the line held without
      retreating a single step. There would then have been a chance of
      peace, which the workers and peasants would have willingly
      supported and approved. That would have been the tactics of the
      defence of the fatherland, not the fatherland of the Romanovs,
      Kerenskys, or Chernovs, a fatherland with secret treaties, a
      fatherland of the treacherous bourgeoisie—not that
      fatherland but the fatherland of the working people. That is who
      is responsible for having made the transition from war to
      revolution and from the Russian revolution to world socialism a
      period of severe trials. That is why such proposals as a
      revolutionary war sound like empty phrases, when we know that we
      have no army, when we know that it would have been impossible to
      hold the army, and people with a knowledge of the situation
      could not help seeing that our decree on demobilisation was not
      an invention but the result of obvious necessity, because it
      would have been impossible to hold the army. The army could not
      have been held. That officer, not a Bolshevik, was right who,
      before the October Revolution, said that the army could not and
      would not fight. [5] This is what has come of months of
      bargaining with the bourgeoisie and of all the speeches about
      the need to continue the war; no matter what noble sentiments on
      the part of many revolutionaries, or of few revolutionaries, may
      have dictated them, they proved to be empty revolutionary
      phrases that played into the hands of international imperialism
      so that it could plunder as much again and more, just as it has
      been doing since our tactical or diplomatic error, since the
      time we did not sign the Brest Treaty. When we told those who
      opposed concluding peace that if we had a respite of any length
      they would realise that the recuperation of the army and the
      interests of the working people were more important than
      anything else, and that peace should have been concluded for
      this reason—they maintained that there could be no
      respite. 

     
      But our revolution differs from all previous revolutions in
      having aroused among the masses a desire to build and create,
      and the working people in the most out-of-the-way villages,
      people humiliated, downtrodden and oppressed by tsars,
      landowners, and bourgeoisie, have been aroused; this is a period
      of the revolution that is only now being accomplished, now that
      the rural revolution is under way, the revolution that is
      building a new way of life. And for the sake of this respite, no
      matter how brief and how small it may be, it was our duty to
      sign the treaty, since we place the interests of the working
      people above the interests of the bourgeois warriors who rattle
      their sabres and call on us to fight. That is what the
      revolution teaches. The revolution teaches that when we make
      diplomatic mistakes, when we assume that the German workers will
      come to our aid tomorrow, when we hope that Liebknecht will be
      victorious immediately (and we know that one way or another
      Liebknecht will win, that is inevitable in the development of
      the working-class movement [applause]), it means that,
      when used unthinkingly, the revolutionary slogans of the
      difficult socialist movement turn into empty phrases. There is
      not a single representative of the working people, there is not
      a single honest worker who would refuse to make the greatest
      sacrifice to help the socialist movement of Germany, because
      during all this time at the front he has learned to distinguish
      between the German imperialists and the soldiers tormented by
      German discipline, most of whom are in sympathy with us. That is
      why I say that the Russian revolution has corrected our mistake
      in practice, has corrected it by giving us the respite. It is
      very probable that it will be an extremely brief one, but we
      have the chance of at least a brief respite in which the army,
      worn out and hungry as it is, will become conscious of the fact
      that it has been given an opportunity to recuperate. It is clear
      to us that the period of the old imperialist wars is over and we
      are threatened with the further horrors of an outbreak of fresh
      wars, but there have been such periods of war in many historical
      epochs, and they have always become most fierce towards the
      end. This must be understood, not only at meetings in Petrograd
      and Moscow; it must be understood by the many tens of millions
      in the countryside; and the more enlightened part of the rural
      population, those returning from the front, those who have
      experienced the horrors of war, must help them understand it;
      the huge masses of peasants and workers must become convinced of
      the necessity for a revolutionary front—they will then say
      we have acted correctly. 

     
      They tell us we have betrayed the Ukraine and Finland—what
      disgrace! But the situation that bas arisen is such that we are
      cut off from Finland, with whom we concluded an unwritten treaty
      before the revolution and have now concluded a formal 
      treaty.[6] They say we are
      surrendering the Ukraine, which Chernov, Kerensky and Tsereteli
      are going to ruin; they say we are traitors, we have betrayed
      the Ukraine! I say: Comrades, I’ve seen enough of the
      history of revolution not to be embarrassed by the hostile
      glances and shouts of people who give way to their feelings and
      are incapable of clear judgement. I will give you a simple
      example. Suppose that two friends are out walking at night and
      they are attacked by ten men. If the scoundrels isolate one of
      them, what is the other to do? He cannot render assistance, and
      if he runs away is he a traitor? And suppose that it is not a
      matter of individuals or of spheres in which questions of direct
      feelings are being settled, but of five armies, each a
      hundred-thousand strong, that surround an army of two hundred
      thousand, and that there is another army that should come to the
      embattled army’s assistance. But if that second army knows
      that it is certain to fall into a trap, it should withdraw; it
      must withdraw, even if the retreat has to be covered by the
      conclusion of an obscene, foul peace—curse as much as you
      like, but it is necessary to conclude the peace. There is no
      reason for considering the feelings of a duelist who draws his
      sword and says that he must die because he is being compelled to
      conclude a humiliating peace. But we all know that, however we
      may decide, we have no army, and no gestures will save us from
      the necessity of withdrawing to gain time and enable our army to
      recuperate; everybody who looks reality in the face and does not
      deceive himself with revolutionary phrase-making will agree with
      this. Anyone who faces the facts without blinding himself with
      phrase-making and arrogance must know this.

     
      If we know this, it is our revolutionary duty to conclude even
      this harsh, super-harsh and rapacious treaty, for by so doing we
      shall reach a better position for ourselves and for our
      allies. Did we actually lose anything by concluding the peace
      treaty of March 3? Anyone who wants to look at things from the
      point of view of mass relations, and not from that of the
      aristocratic duelist, will realise that without an army, or
      having only the sick remnant of an army, it would be
      self-deception, it would he the greatest deception of the
      people, to accept battle and call it a revolutionary war. It is
      our duty to tell the people the truth; yes, the peace is a harsh
      one. The Ukraine and Finland are perishing but we must accept
      this peace and all class-conscious working people in Russia will
      accept it because they know the unvarnished truth, they know the
      meaning of war, they know that to stake everything on one card
      on the assumption that the German revolution will begin
      immediately is self-deception. By concluding peace we have
      obtained what we gave our Finnish friends—a respite, help
      and not destruction. 

     
      I know of examples from history of much more rapacious peace
      treaties having been concluded, treaties that surrendered viable
      nations to the mercy of the conqueror. Let us compare our peace
      to the Peace of Tilsit; the Peace of TiIsit was enforced on
      Prussia and Germany by a conqueror. That peace was so harsh that
      not only were all the capital cities of all the German states
      seized, not only were the Prussians thrown back to Tilsit, which
      would be the same as throwing us back to Omsk or Tomsk; not only
      that—the worst of all was that Napoleon compelled the
      conquered peoples to supply him with auxiliary troops for his
      wars; but nevertheless, when the situation became such that the
      German peoples had to withstand the attacks of the conquer or,
      when the epoch of revolutionary wars in France gave place to the
      epoch of imperialist wars of conquest, then came the revelation
      which those people who wax enthusiastic over empty phrases do
      not want to understand, those people, that is, who picture the
      conclusion of peace as a downfall. This psychology is
      understandable in an aristocratic duelist but not in a worker or
      peasant. The latter has been through the hard school of war and
      has learned to calculate. There have been even greater trials,
      and nations even more backward have come through them. Harsher
      peace treaties have been concluded, the Germans concluded one in
      an epoch when they had no army, or when their army was sick like
      ours. They concluded a very harsh peace with Napoleon. But that
      peace was not the downfall of Germany—on the contrary, it
      was the turning-point, national defence, renewal. We are on the
      eve of just such a turning-point and are experiencing analogous
      conditions. We must look truth in the face and banish all empty
      phrases and declarations. We must say, peace, if it is
      necessary, must be concluded. The war of liberation, the class
      war, the war of the people will take the place of the Napoleonic
      wars. The system of the Napoleonic wars will change, war will
      give place to peace and peace to war, and from every harsh peace
      there has always emerged a more extensive preparation for
      war. The harshest of peace treaties—the Peace of
      Tilsit—has gone down in history as a turning-point towards
      the time when the German people began to swing round; when they
      retreated to Tilsit, to Russia, they were actually gaining time,
      waiting for the international situation that had, at one time,
      favoured Napoleon—he was another plunderer like
      Hohenzollern or Hindenburg—waiting until the situation
      changed, until the mentality of the German people, tormented by
      decades of Napoleonic wars and defeats, had recuperated and the
      German people were resuscitated. That is what history teaches
      us, that is why all despair and empty phrases are criminal, that
      is why everyone will say yes, the old imperialist wars are
      ending—an historical turning-point has come. 

     
      Our revolution has been one long triumph since October, and now
      the lengthy times of hardship have come, we do not know for how
      long, but we do know that it will be a long and difficult period
      of defeats and retreats, because the alignment of forces is what
      it is, because by retreating we shall give the people a chance
      to recuperate. We shall make it possible for every worker and
      peasant to realise the truth that will enable him to understand
      that new wars waged by the imperialist plunderers against the
      oppressed peoples are beginning, and every worker and peasant
      will realise that we must rise in defence of the fatherland,
      because we have been defencists since October. Since October 25
      we have said openly that we stand for the defence of the
      fatherland, because we have a fatherland, the one from which we
      have driven the Kerenskys and Chernovs, because we have torn up
      the secret treaties, because we have crushed the
      bourgeoisie—badly so far, but we shall learn to do it
      better. 

     
      Comrades, there is another important difference between the
      condition of the German people and of the Russian people who
      have suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the German
      invaders—there is a tremendous difference that must be
      mentioned, although I have already touched upon it briefly in
      the preceding part of my speech. Comrades, when the German
      people, over a hundred years ago, entered a period of the most
      cruel wars of conquest, a period when they had to retreat and
      conclude one shameful treaty after another before they were
      awakened—at that time the German people were weak and
      backward, just that and nothing more. They had against them not
      only the military forces and the might of the conqueror
      Napoleon, they had against them a country that was far above
      Germany in the revolutionary and political sense and in every
      other respect, a country that had risen far above all others, a
      country that had reached the top. That country was far above the
      people who were languishing in subjection to the imperialists
      and landowners. A people that, I repeat, had been nothing but a
      weak and backward people, managed to learn from its bitter
      lessons and to raise itself up. We are in a better position; we
      are not merely a weak and backward people, we are the people who
      have been able—not because of any special services or of
      historical predestination, but because of a definite conjunction
      of historical circumstances—who have been able to accept
      the honour of raising the banner of the international socialist
      revolution. (Applause.) 

     
      I am well aware, comrades, that the banner is in weak hands, I
      have said that outright several times already, and the workers
      of the most backward country will not be able to hold that
      banner unless the workers of all advanced countries come to
      their aid. The socialist reforms that we have accomplished are
      far from perfect, they are weak and insufficient; they will
      serve as a guide to the advanced West-European workers who will
      say to themselves, “The Russians haven’t made a very
      good beginning on the job that has to be done”; the
      important thing is that our people are not merely a weak and
      backward people as compared with the Germans, they are the
      people who have raised the banner of revolution. Although the
      bourgeoisie of any country you like are filling the columns of
      their press with slander of the Bolsheviks, although the voice
      of the imperialist press in France, Britain, Germany, etc.,
      curses the Bolsheviks in unison, you will not find a meeting of
      workers in any country at which the names and slogans of our
      socialist government give rise to bursts of
      indignation. (Voice : ’That’s a
      lie!”) No, it is not, it is the truth, and anyone who has
      been in Germany, Austria, Switzerland or America during the past
      few months will tell you it is the truth and not a lie, that the
      names and slogans of representatives of Soviet power in Russia
      are greeted with the greatest enthusiasm by the workers and
      that, despite all the lies of the bourgeoisie of Germany,
      France, etc., the working-class masses have realised that no
      matter how weak we may be, their cause is being served here in
      Russia. Yes, our people have a very heavy burden to bear, the
      burden they have themselves taken up; but a people that has been
      able to establish Soviet power cannot perish. Again I
      repeat—there is not a single politically conscious
      socialist, not a single worker among those who think over the
      history of the revolution, who can dispute the fact that Soviet
      power— despite all the defects that I know only too well
      and fully appreciate—is the highest type of state, the
      direct successor to the Paris Commune. It has ascended a step
      higher than the other European revolutions so that we are not
      experiencing the difficult conditions that the German people
      experienced a hundred years ago; the change in the balance of
      forces among the plunderers, taking advantage of the conflict
      and satisfying the demands of plunderer Napoleon, plunderer
      Alexander I and the plundering British monarchy—that was
      the only thing left, the one chance, for the German people,
      oppressed by feudalism; and yet the German people did not perish
      from the Peace of Tilsit. But we, I say again, have better
      conditions, we have a powerful ally in all West-European
      countries, the international socialist proletariat, the
      proletariat that is on our side no matter what our enemies may
      say. (Applause.) True, it is not easy for that ally to
      raise his voice, any more than it was easy for us until the end
      of February 1917. That ally is living in the underground, under
      conditions of the military prison into which all imperialist
      countries have been turned, but he knows us and understands our
      cause; it is difficult for him to come to our aid, and Soviet
      troops, therefore, will need much time and patience and will
      have to go through many trials before the time comes when he
      will aid us—we shall use even the slightest chance of
      procrastination, for time is working on our side. Our cause is
      gaining strength, the forces of the imperialists are weakening,
      and no matter what trials and defeats may emerge from the
      “Tilsit” peace, we are beginning the tactics of
      withdrawal and, once more I say it, there is no doubt the
      politically-conscious proletariat and, likewise, the
      politically-conscious peasants are on our side, and we shall be
      able not only to make heroic at tacks, but also to make a heroic
      retreat and we shall wait until the international socialist
      proletariat comes to our aid and shall then begin a second
      socialist revolution that will be world-wide in its
      scope. (Applause.)

Reply To The Debate On The Report On Ratification Of The Peace Treaty March 15
 
      Comrades, had I desired to find a confirmation of what was said
      in my first speech about the nature of the revolutionary war
      that was proposed to us, the best and clearest confirmation
      would have been given me by the report of the representative of
      the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries.[7] I think it will be most expedient if I
      quote his speech from the verbatim report and we shall see what
      arguments they adduce in confirmation of their propositions. 

     
      Here is a specimen of the arguments on which they rely. There
      has been talk here of the volost gathering.[8] Those who consider this
      meeting a volost gathering can resort to such arguments, but it
      is clear that these people are repeating our words but are
      incapable of thinking them out. People repeat what the
      Bolsheviks taught the Left S.R.s when the latter were still
      among the Rights, and when they speak it is evident that they
      have learnt by rote what we said, but they have not understood
      on what it was based, and now they repeat it. Tsereteli and
      Chernov were defencists, and now we are defencists, we are
      “traitors”,  we are “betrayers”. The
      accomplices of the bourgeoisie speak here about a volost
      gathering—they make eyes when they say this—but
      every worker understands very well the aims of the defencism by
      which Tsereteli and Chernov were guided and the grounds which
      cause us to be defencists. 

     
      If we were to support the Russian capitalists who wanted to be
      given the Dardanelles, Armenia and Galicia, as it was written in
      the secret treaty, that would be defencism in the spirit of
      Chernov and Tsereteli, and that defencism was disgraceful then,
      but now our defencism is honourable. (Applause.) 

     
      And when, alongside such arguments, in the verbatim report of
      Kamkov’s speech I find twice repeated the statement that
      the Bolsheviks are agents of German imperialism (applause
      from the Right ), a harsh term—I am very glad that
      all those who pursued Kerensky’s policy emphasise it by
      their applause. (Applause. ) And indeed, of course, it
      is not for me to object to harsh words. I shall never raise any
      objection to that. Only, in order to be harsh one must have the
      right to be so, and the right to be harsh is given by
      one’s words not differing from one’s deeds. That is
      the little condition which many intellectuals do not appreciate,
      but which the workers and peasants have grasped even at volost
      gatherings—it is such a meagre thing, the volost
      gathering—they have grasped it both at volost gatherings
      and in Soviet organisations, and their word does not differ from
      their deed. But we are very well aware that they, the Left
      S.R.s, remained in the party of the Right S.R.s until October,
      during the time when the latter were sharing the rewards of
      office, when they acted as agents because they had been promised
      ministerial posts in return for keeping silent about the secret
      treaties. (Applause.) But it is quite impossible to
      call agents of imperialism people who actually proclaimed war
      against it, tore up the treaties and undertook the risk that
      this involved, undertook to drag out the negotiations in Brest,
      knowing that this would ruin the country, endured the military
      attack and a series of unprecedented defeats, and did not
      conceal the slightest thing from the people. 

     
      Martov has assured us here that he has not read the treaty. Let
      those who like to, believe him. We know that these people are
      accustomed to read a lot of newspapers, but they have not read
      the treaty. (Applause.) Let those who wish, believe
      it. But I tell you that, while the party of the S.R.s knows very
      well that we are giving way in the face of violence, which has
      been fully exposed by us, that we are doing so deliberately,
      frankly saying that we are unable to fight just now but are
      giving way—history. knows of a number of most shameful
      treaties and a number of wars—when people in reply to this
      produce the word “agents”,  this harshness exposes
      them, and when they assure us that they disclaim responsibility
      for what they are doing—is it not hypocrisy, when people
      disclaim responsibility but continue to be in the government? I
      maintain that when they say that they disclaim
      responsibility—they do not divest themselves of it, and
      they are quite wrong in thinking this is a volost gathering. No,
      this is everything that is honest and best among the working
      masses. (Applause.) This is no bourgeois parliament to
      which people are elected once or twice a year to take their
      seats and receive a salary. These are people sent from the
      provinces and tomorrow they will be in the provinces and will
      relate that if the party of Left S.R.s is losing votes, it
      deserves to, because the party which acts in this way is the
      same soap bubble among the peasantry as it proved to be among
      the working class. (Applause, voices:
      “Quite right.”) 

     
      Further, I will quote you one more passage from Kamkov’s
      speech to show how every representative of the working and
      exploited people reacts to it. “When yesterday Comrade
      Lenin asserted here that Comrades Tsereteli and Chernov and
      others had demoralised the army, can we really not find the
      courage to say that Lenin and I also demoralised the
      army?” He is a long way wide of the
      mark. (Applause.) He has heard that we were defeatists,
      and he has recalled this when we have ceased to be
      defeatists. He has recalled it at the wrong time. They have
      learnt the word by heart, they have a revolutionary-sounding toy
      rattle to play with, but they are incapable of giving some
      thought to the actual state of affairs. (Applause.) I
      assert that out of a thousand volost gatherings where Soviet
      power has been consolidated, in more than nine hundred there are
      people who will tell the Party of Left S.R.s that they do not
      deserve any confidence. They will say—all right; we
      demoralised the army and we must recall that now. But how did we
      demoralise the army? We were defeatists at the time of the tsar,
      but at the time of Tsereteli and Chernov we were not
      defeatists. We published in Pravda a proclamation which
      Krylenko, who was then still being persecuted, addressed to the
      army: “Why I am going to Petrograd.” He said:
      “We are not calling on you for mutinies.” That was
      not demoralisation of the army. Those who declared this war to
      be a great war were the ones who demoralised the army. 

     
      It was Tsereteli and Chernov who demoralised the army because
      they spoke grand words to the people, words which many Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries were accustomed to throw out at
      random. It is easy to play with words, but the Russian people at
      volost gatherings are accustomed to think over them and take
      them seriously. If, however, the people were told that we were
      striving for peace and discussing the conditions of the
      imperialist war, then I ask: and what about the secret treaties
      and the June offensive? That is how they demoralised the
      army. If they spoke to the people about the struggle against the
      imperialists, about defence of the homeland, the people asked
      themselves: do they seize the capitalists by the scruff of the
      neck somewhere?—that is how they demoralised the army, and
      that is why I said, and no one has refuted it, it would have
      been the salvation of the army if we had taken power in March or
      April, and if instead of the furious hatred of the exploiters
      because we suppressed them—they quite justifiably hate
      us—if instead of this they had put the interests of the
      homeland of the working and exploited people higher than the
      interests of the homeland of Kerensky and Ryabushinsky’s
      secret treaties, and of designs on Armenia, Galicia and the
      Dardanelles, that would have spelt salvation. And in this
      connection—beginning with the great Russian Revolution,
      and especially from March, when a half-hearted appeal to the
      peoples of all countries[9] was issued—the government, which
      issued the appeal that called for the overthrow of the bankers
      of all countries, was itself sharing profits and favours with
      the bankers—that is what demoralised the army and why the
      army could not keep going. (Applause.) 

     
      And I assert that we—beginning from this appeal of
      Krylenko’s, which was not the first, [10] and which I am recalling
      because it stuck in my mind—we did not demoralise the army
      but said: hold the front—the sooner you take power the
      easier will it be to retain it, and to say now: we are against
      civil war and for an uprising—how unworthy this is and how
      despicable this chatter of some people. When this reaches the
      countryside and when the soldiers there, who have seen war not
      as the intellectuals have, and who know that it is easy to wave
      only a cardboard sword, when they say that at the critical
      moment they, unshod, badly clothed and suffering, were helped by
      being driven into an offensive—they are now being told
      that it doesn’t matter that there will be no army, there
      will be an uprising instead. To drive the people against a
      regular army with superior technical equipment—that is
      criminal, and we, as socialists, taught that it is so. Indeed,
      the war taught a great deal, not only that people suffered, but
      also that those who have the greatest technical equipment,
      organisation and discipline, and the best machines, will gain
      the upper hand; the war taught this, and it is excellent that it
      did so. It has to be learnt that it is impossible to live in
      modern society without machines, without discipline—one
      has either to master modern techniques or be crushed. Years of
      most painful suffering have taught the peasants what war is. And
      when anyone goes speech-making at the volost gatherings, when
      the party of Left S.R.s goes there, they will receive
      well-merited punishment. (Applause.) 

     
      One more example, another quotation from Kamkov’s
      speech. (He reads it.) 

     
      It is sometimes surprisingly easy to raise questions; only there
      is a saying—an impolite, rude one—which refers to
      such questions—I’m afraid I can’t change the
      proverb—I will remind you of it: one fool can ask more
      questions than ten wise men can answer. 

     
      Comrades, in the quotation I have just read out I am invited to
      answer the question: will the respite last one week, two weeks,
      or will it last more? I assert that at any volost gathering or
      at any factory a person who in the name of a serious party comes
      out with such a question will be laughed at by the people and
      chased away, because at any volost gathering they will
      understand that there is no point in raising questions about
      something that cannot be known. That will be understood by any
      worker and peasant. (Applause.) If you absolutely
      insist on an answer, I will tell you that of course any Left
      S.R. who writes in the newspapers or speaks at meetings will say
      what this duration depends on: it depends on when Japan attacks,
      with what forces, and what resistance it encounters; on the
      extent to which the Germans get into difficulties in Finland, in
      the Ukraine; on when the offensive on all fronts begins; on how
      it develops; on the further course of the internal conflict in
      Austria and Germany, and on many other things as
      well. (Applause.) 

     
      Therefore, when at a serious meeting people with an air of
      triumph raise the question: answer me, what kind of a respite
      will it be?—I say that such people will be chased out of
      workers’ and peasants’ meetings by those who
      understand that after three years of war torment, every week of
      respite is a very great boon. (Applause.) And I assert that
      whatever the abuse now heaped on us here, if tomorrow all the
      abusive terms addressed to us from the Rights, almost-Rights,
      near-Rights, Left S.R.s, Cadets, and Mensheviks were collected
      together and published, even if some hundreds of poods were the
      result, as far as I am concerned all this would weigh as light
      as a feather compared with the fact that among us in the
      Bolshevik group nine-tenths of its representatives have said: we
      know war and we see that now, when we have secured this short
      respite, it is an advantage for the recovery of our sick
      army. And at every peasant meeting nine-tenths of the peasants
      will say what everyone who concerns himself with the matter
      knows, and when able to help in any way we have not rejected and
      do not reject any practical proposal. 

     
      We have gained the possibility of a respite, even if only for
      twelve days, thanks to the policy which has countered
      revolutionary phrase-making and “public”
      opinion. When Kamkov and the Left S.R.s play a game with you and
      make eyes at you, then, on the one hand, they are making eyes at
      you and, on the other, they are saying to the
      Constitutional-Democrats: put that down in our favour, indeed,
      we are heart and soul with you. (Voice from the hall :
      “It’s a lie.”) And when one of the
      representatives of the S.R.s, apparently not even of the Lefts,
      but of the super-Lefts, a Maximalist, spoke about phrase-making,
      he said that phrase-making was everything that concerned
      honour. (A voice : “Quite right.”) Well, of
      course, in the Right-wing camp they call out “quite
      right”; this exclamation is pleasanter to me than the
      exclamation “it’s a lie”,  although that does
      not impress me in the slightest either. But if I were to accuse
      them of phrase-making without giving any clear and precise
      confirmation of it, but the fact is I quoted two examples and I
      took them not from my imagination but from actual occurrence. 

     
      Remember, were not the representatives of the S.R.s in the same
      situation when in 1907 they gave their signatures to Stolypin
      that they would faithfully and truly serve the Emperor Nicholas
      II? I hope that I have learnt something from the long years of
      the revolution, and when I am defamed by accusations of
      treachery, I say: one must first of all be able to find
      one’s way in history. If we wanted to alter the course of
      history and it turns out that it was we who altered course and
      not history—then execute us. History is not to be
      convinced by speeches, and history will show that we were right,
      that we brought the workers’ organisations into the Great
      October Revolution of 1917, but only thanks to the fact that we
      rose above phrase-making and knew how to look at the facts, to
      learn from them. And when now, on March 14-15, it has become
      clear that if we had fought we should have helped imperialism,
      we should have finally wrecked the transport system and lost
      Petrograd—we see that to play with words and wave a
      cardboard sword is useless. But when Kamkov comes to me and asks
      “will this respite be for long?”,  it is impossible
      to give an answer because internationally there has not been an
      objective revolutionary situation. There cannot be a long
      respite for reaction now because the objective situation is
      everywhere revolutionary, because everywhere the working-class
      masses are indignant, are at the limit of their patience, at the
      limit of exhaustion from the war; that is a fact. It is
      impossible to escape from this fact, and therefore I have been
      proving to you that there was a period when the revolution went
      ahead and we went in front and the Left S.R.s stepped out
      perkily behind us. (Applause.) But now a period has
      begun when we have to retreat in the face of overwhelming
      force. That is an absolutely concrete description. No one will
      rebut me on this. Historical analysis is bound to confirm
      it. Here you have our Marxist, almost Marxist, Martov, speaking
      ill of the volost gathering; he speaks ill of the closing down
      of newspapers; he boasts that the oppressed and offended
      newspapers were closed down because they were helping to
      overthrow Soviet power, he speaks ill of. . . About this he does
      not keep silent. Such things he sets before you, but an attempt
      to answer the historical question put point-blank by me, whether
      it is the truth or not that since October we have made a
      triumphant advance. . . . (Voices from the Right :
      “No.”) You say “no”,  but all these say
      “yes”. I ask: can we now make a victorious advance
      in an offensive against world imperialism. We cannot, and
      everyone knows it. When this, a frank simple statement, is made
      forthrightly in order to teach people
      revolution—revolution is a profound, difficult and complex
      science—in order to teach both the workers and the
      peasants, the people who are making the revolution, how to do
      so, our enemies cry out: cowards, traitors, the flag has been
      abandoned; they fall back on words, they wave their
      arms. No. The whole history of revolutions has shown many such
      revolutionary phrase-mongers and nothing is left of them but
      stench and smoke. (Applause.) 

     
      Another example I cited, comrades, was that of Germany, of
      Germany which was crushed by Napoleon, of Germany which
      witnessed shameful peace alternating with wars. I am asked: are
      we going to observe the treaties for a long time? If it were a
      three-year-old child who asked me: are you going to observe the
      treaty or not?—it would be both pleasant and
      naïve. But when grown-up Kamkov of the party of Left S.R.s
      asks it, I know a few adult workers and peasants will believe in
      the naïveté, but the majority of them will say:
      “Stop being hypocritical.” For the historical
      example I cited shows as clearly as can be that emancipatory
      wars of peoples that have lost an army—and that has
      happened more than once—of peoples crushed to the extent
      of complete loss of all their territory, crushed to such an
      extent that they have surrendered auxiliary corps to the
      conqueror for new annexationist campaigns—cannot be struck
      out of history, and can in no way be erased. If, however, the
      Left S.R. Kamkov, in rebutting me, said, as I saw in the
      verbatim report: “In Spain, however, there were
      revolutionary wars,” he thereby confirmed what I am
      saying, indeed he hit out at himself. Spain and Germany
      precisely confirm my example that to decide the question of the
      historical period of annexationist wars on the basis of
      “are you going to observe the treaty and, when you violate
      it, when will they catch you. . . ?” is indeed worthy of
      children. History tells us that every treaty results from a
      cessation of struggle and a change in the relationship of
      forces, that there have been peace treaties which were shattered
      in a few days, that there have been peace treaties which were
      shattered after a month, that there were periods of many years
      when Germany and Spain concluded peace and violated it after a
      few months, violated it several times, and in a series of wars
      the peoples learnt what waging war means. When Napoleon led
      German armies in order to strangle other peoples he taught them
      revolutionary war. Such was the course of history. 

     
      That is why I tell you, comrades, that I am deeply convinced
      that the decision adopted by nine-tenths of our Bolshevik
      group[11] will
      be approved by nine-tenths of all the politically-conscious
      working people of Russia—workers and
      peasants. (Applause.) 

     
      We have a means of checking whether I spoke the truth or whether
      I am mistaken, for you will go into the provinces and each one
      of you will report to the local Soviets, and everywhere there
      will be local decisions. I will say in conclusion: do not
      succumb to provocation. The bourgeoisie knows what it is doing,
      the bourgeoisie knows why it rejoiced in Pskov, rejoiced
      recently in Odessa, the bourgeoisie of the Vinnichenkos, of the
      Ukrainian Kerenskys, of Tsereteli and Chernov. It rejoiced
      because it understood perfectly what a tremendous mistake in
      diplomacy, in taking account of the situation, Soviet power had
      committed by trying to wage war with a fleeing, sick army. The
      bourgeoisie is trying to draw you into the pitfall of war. One
      has not only to attack but also to retreat. Every soldier knows
      that. Realise that the bourgeoisie is trying to draw both you
      and us into a trap. Realise that the whole bourgeoisie and all
      its voluntary and involuntary accomplices are setting this
      trap. You will be able to endure the most severe defeats and to
      maintain the most difficult positions, and by retreating to gain
      time. Time is on our side. The imperialists, having glutted
      themselves, will burst, and in their womb a new giant is
      developing; it is growing more slowly than we should like, but
      it is growing, it will come to our aid, and when we see that it
      is beginning to strike its first blow, we shall say: the time
      for retreat has come to an end, the era of the world offensive
      and the era of the victory of the world socialist revolution is
      beginning. (Stormy applause, continuing for a long
      time.)

Resolution On Ratification Of The Brest Treaty

      The Congress confirms (ratifies) the peace treaty signed by our
      representatives at Brest-Litovsk on March 3, 1918. 

     
      The Congress recognises as correct the actions of the Central
      Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars
      in deciding to conclude the present incredibly harsh, rapacious
      and humiliating peace in view of our having no army and of the
      extreme war weariness of the people, who in their distress have
      received no support from the bourgeoisie and bourgeois
      intelligentsia, but have seen that distress made use of for
      selfish class purposes. 

     
      The Congress also recognises the undoubted correctness of the
      actions of the peace delegation that refused to enter into a
      detailed discussion on the German peace terms, because those
      terms were imposed on us in the form of an obvious ultimatum and
      by undisguised force. 

     
      The Congress most insistently urges upon all workers, soldiers
      and peasants, all the working and oppressed masses, the main,
      immediate and most urgent task of the moment—the
      improvement of the discipline and self-discipline of the working
      people; the creation throughout the country of strong,
      well-founded organisations that cover, as far as possible, all
      production and distribution; a ruthless struggle against the
      chaos, disorganisation and economic ruin which are historically
      inevitable as the legacy of a most agonising war, but which are,
      at the same time, the main obstacle to the complete victory of
      socialism and the strengthening of the foundations of socialist
      society. 

     
      Today, after the October Revolution, after the overthrow of the
      political power of the bourgeoisie in Russia, after our
      denunciation and publication of all secret imperialist treaties,
      after the cancellation of the foreign loans, after the
      workers’ and peasants’ government has proposed a
      just peace to all peoples without exception, Russia, having
      escaped from the clutches of the imperialist war, has the right
      to announce that she is not a participant in the plunder and
      suppression of other countries. 

     
      The Russian Soviet Federative Republic, having unanimously
      condemned predatory wars, from now on deems it its right and its
      duty to defend the socialist fatherland against all possible
      attacks by any of the imperialist powers. 

     
      The Congress therefore deems it the unconditional duty of all
      working people to muster all forces to re-establish and improve
      the defence potential of our country, to re-establish its
      military strength on the basis of a socialist militia and the
      universal military training of all adolescents and adults of
      both sexes. 

     
      The Congress expresses its absolute confidence that Soviet
      power, which has valiantly fulfilled all the obligations of the
      international solidarity of the workers of all countries in
      their struggle for socialism against the yoke of capital, will
      in future do everything possible to promote the international
      socialist movement, to secure and shorten the road leading
      mankind to deliverance from the yoke of capital and from wage
      slavery, to the creation of a socialist society and to an
      enduring, just peace between the peoples. 

     
      The Congress is firmly convinced that the international
      workers’ revolution is not far away, that the full victory
      of the socialist proletariat is assured despite the fact that
      the imperialists of all countries do not hesitate to use the
      most brutal means for the suppression of the socialist
      movement.

1.
Extraordinary Fourth All-Russia Congress of Soviets,
      which was held to decide the question of the ratification of the
      Peace Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, was held in Moscow from March 14 to
      16, 1918. On March 13 this question was discussed by the Communist
      group of the Congress; Lenin spoke at the meeting (for the
      secretarial record of this speech see Lenin Miscellany
XI, pp. 68-70). By 453 votes to 36 the group approved the
      signing of the treaty. Not all the delegates had arrived at the
      time and the group was not present in full strength. 

    
      According to the minutes, the Congress was attended by 1,232
      delegates with a vote; they included 795 Bolsheviks, 283 Left
      Socialist-Revolutionaries, 25 Socialist-Revolutionaries of the
      Centre, 21 Mensheviks, and 11 Menshevik-Internationalists. The
      questions on the agenda were: ratification of the peace treaty;
      transfer of the capital; election of the All-Russia C.E.C. After
      a statement on the peace treaty by G. V. Chicherin,
      People’s Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Lenin gave
      the report on the main question on the agenda on behalf of the
      All-Russia Central Executive Committee; the second report on
      behalf of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries against
      ratification of the treaty was given by B. D. Kamkov. 

    
      The Mensheviks, Right and Left Socialist-Revolutionaries,
      Maximalists, anarchists and others put up a solid front against
      ratification of the treaty. After a keen debate a signed vote
      was taken and the Congress adopted Lenin’s resolution in
      favour of ratification by an overwhelming majority. There were
      784 votes in favour, 261 against and 115 delegates abstained. In
      connection with the ratification of the Brest Treaty the Left
      S.R.s withdrew from the Council of People’s
      Commissars. The “Left Communists” refused to take
      part in the voting and stated in a special declaration that the
      conclusion of peace would undermine the country’s defence
      and the gains of the revolution. By refusing to vote, the
      “Left Communists” violated the decisions of the
      Seventh Party Congress and the Communist group of the
      Extraordinary Fourth All-Russia Congress of Soviets and the
      decision taken by the Central Committee, which met while the
      Congress was on, that there should be no action against the
      decisions of the Party.
 
    
      The Congress passed a resolution on the transfer of the capital
      of the Soviet state to Moscow and elected a Central Executive
      Committee consisting of 200 members.

    
      The decision of the Congress on ratification of the peace treaty
      was approved by the local Soviets, the Party organisations and
      the working people at numerous meetings and conferences held at
      the time.
 
    
2. The
      draft resolution was written by Lenin in reply to a message from
      Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, in which he tried,
      by expressing sympathy he probably did not feel for the Russian
      people over the German occupation of the Baltic States,
      Byelorussia and the Ukraine, to influence the decision of the
      Congress and prevent Soviet Russia from ratifying the peace treaty
      with Germany. 
 
      The draft resolution was read out by Y. M. Sverdlov and approved by the Congress. 

    
3.      
      The reference is to the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary
      parties, which were represented in the Soviets of
      Workers’, Peasants’ and Soldiers’
      Deputies. The Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, however,
      soon took the path of direct counter-revolution and on June 14,
      1918 the All-Russia C.E.C. passed a decision expelling the
      counter-revolutionary Socialist-Revolutionaries (the Rights and
      the Centre) and the Mensheviks from the All-Russia Central
      Executive Committee and the local Soviets. The decision was
      published on June 18 in Izvestia VTsIK No. 123. 
      
    
4.
      Lenin appears to connect the new turn in the development of the
      revolution with February 10, when Germany broke off peace
      negotiations in Brest-Litovsk. The German action was facilitated
      by L. D. Trotsky’s refusal to conclude peace on the terms
      proposed by the German imperialists. Lenin also mentions this
      date in the plan he made for his report to the Extraordinary
      Fourth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on ratification of the
      Brest Treaty. In another document, the plan for his speech at a
      meeting of the Communist group of the Congress of Soviets, Lenin
      defines the turning point in the development of the revolution
      as February 17. The German offensive along the whole front began
      on February 18, 1918. 

    
5.
      Lenin has in mind the speech at the meeting of the Petrograd
      Soviet on September 21 (October 4), 1917 by Dubasov, an army
      officer who had returned from the front. Describing the mood of
      the soldiers, Dubasov stated that they wanted only one thing, an
      end to the war, and that they would not go on fighting. 

    
6.
      The reference is to the Treaty between the Russian and Finnish
      Socialist Republics, the first treaty in history between
      socialist countries. In the middle of February 1918, the
      revolutionary government of the Finnish republic proposed a
      treaty of friendship to the Soviet Government. The
      Russia-Finland Co-ordinative Commission was formed to draw up
      the treaty and its draft was discussed at several meetings of
      the Council of People’s Commissars, Lenin making several
      amendments to it. The treaty was signed on March 1 by a special
      commission headed by Lenin. It was endorsed by the Council of
      People’s Commissars and published on March 10, 1918 in
      Izvestia VTsIK No. 45 (see Decrees of the Soviet
      Government, Russ. ed., Vol: 1, 1957, pp. 503-10). Based on
      recognition of the state sovereignty of Finland, the treaty
      provided evidence of the Soviet Government’s consistent
      adherence to the principle of the right of nations to
      self-determination. 

    7.
      Lenin is referring to the second report, by B. D. Kamkov, on the
      question of ratification of the peace treaty. 

    8.
      In his speech at the Congress the Menshevik L. Martov claimed
      that the contents of the treaty were not known to the Congress
      delegates and compared them to peasants at a volost gathering,
      forced by the local authorities to sign papers without knowing
      what was in them. 
 
    9.
      Lenin is referring to the appeal of the Petrograd Soviet of
      Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies “To the
      Peoples of the Whole World”,  which was published in the
      leading newspapers on March 15 (28), 1917. For an appraisal of
      this half-hearted Menshevik-Socialist-Revolutionary appeal see
      Lenin’s speech on war, delivered June 9 (22) 1917 at the
      First All-Russia Congress of Soviets (present edition, Vol. 25,
      pp. 29-42).   

    10.
      The Appeal to the Soldiers of All the Belligerent Countries was
      the first appeal written by Lenin on behalf of the Central
      Committee of the Bolshevik Party, the St. Petersburg Committee
      and the editorial board of Pravda (see present edition,
      Vol. 24, pp. 186-88).  

    11.
      When the resolution on ratification of the Peace Treaty of
      Brest-Litovsk was put to the vote at the Communist group of the
      Extraordinary Fourth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on March 13,
      1918, 453 votes were cast in favour of ratification and 36
      against.

The International Position Of The Russian Soviet Republic And The Fundamental Tasks Of
 The Socialist Revolution


Thanks to the peace which has been achieved—despite its extremely onerous character and extreme instability—the Russian Soviet Republic has gained an opportunity to concentrate its efforts for a while on the most important and most difficult aspect of the socialist revolution, namely, the task of organisation. This task was clearly and definitely set before all the working and oppressed people in the fourth paragraph (Part 4) of the resolution adopted at the Extraordinary Congress of Soviets in Moscow on March 15, 1918, in that paragraph (or part) which speaks of the self-discipline of the working people and of the ruthless struggle against chaos and disorganisation.[See also Resolution On Ratification Of The Brest Treaty—Editor.] Of course, the peace achieved by the Russian Soviet Republic is unstable not because she is now thinking of resuming military operations; apart from bourgeois counter-revolutionaries and their henchmen (the Mensheviks and others), no sane politician thinks of doing that. The instability of the peace is due to the fact that in the imperialist states bordering on Russia to the West and the East, which command enormous military forces, the military party, tempted by Russia’s momentary weakness and egged on by capitalists, who hate socialism and are eager for plunder, may gain the upper hand at any moment. Under these circumstances the only real, not paper, guarantee of peace we have is the antagonism among the imperialist powers, which has reached extreme limits, and which is apparent on the one hand in the resumption of the imperialist butchery of the peoples in the West, and on the other hand in the extreme intensification of imperialist rivalry between Japan and America for supremacy in the Pacific and on the Pacific coast.
It goes without saying that with such an unreliable guard for protection, our Soviet Socialist Republic is in an extremely unstable and certainly critical international position. All our efforts must be exerted to the very utmost to make use of the respite given us by the combination of circumstances so that we can heal the very severe wounds innicted by the war upon the entire social organism of Russia and bring about an economic revival, without which a real increase in our country’s defence potential is inconceivable.
It also goes without saying that we shall be able to render effective assistance to the socialist revolution in the West which has been delayed for a number of reasons, only to the extent that we are able to fulfil the task of organisation confronting us.
A fundamental condition for the successful accomplishment of the primary task of organisation confronting us is that the people’s political leaders, i.e., the members of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and following them all the class-conscious representatives of the mass of the working people, shall fully appreciate the radical distinction in this respect between previous bourgeois revolutions and the present socialist revolution.
In bourgeois revolutions, the principal task of the mass of working people was to fulfil the negative or destructive work of abolishing feudalism, monarchy and medievalism. The positive or constructive work of organising the new society was carried out by the property-owning bourgeois minority of the population. And the latter carried out this task with relative ease, despite the resistance of the workers and the poor peasants, not only because the resistance of the people exploited by capital was then extremely weak, since they were scattered and uneducated, but also because the chief organising force of anarchically built capitalist society is the spontaneously growing and expanding national and international market.
In every socialist revolution, however—and consequently in the socialist revolution in Russia which we began on October 25, 1917—the principal task of the proletariat, and of the poor peasants which it leads, is the positive or constructive work of setting up an extremely intricate and delicate system of new organisational relationships extending to the planned production and distribution of the goods required for the existence of tens of millions of people. Such a revolution can be successfully carried out only if the majority of the population, and primarily the majority of the working people, engage in independent creative work as makers of history. Only if the proletariat and the poor peasants display sufficient class-consciousness, devotion to principle, self-sacrifice and perseverance, will the victory of the socialist revolution be assured. By creating a new, Soviet type of state, which gives the working and oppressed people the chance to take an active part in the independent building up of a new society, we solved only a small part of this difficult problem . The principal difficulty lies in the economic sphere, namely, the introduction of the strictest and universal accounting and control of the production and distribution of goods, raising the productivity of labour and socialising production in practice.
The development of the Bolshevik Party, which today is the governing party in Russia, very strikingly indicates the nature of the turning-point in history we have now reached, which is the peculiar feature of the present political situation, and which calls for a new orientation of Soviet power, i.e., for a new presentation of new tasks.
The first task of every party of the future is to convince, the majority of the people that its programme and tactics are correct. This task stood in the forefront both in tsarist times and in the period of the Chernovs’ and Tseretelis’ policy of compromise with the Kerenskys and Kishkins. This task has now been fulfilled in the main, for, as the recent Congress of Soviets in Moscow incontrovertibly proved, the majority of the workers and peasants of Russia are obviously on the side of the Bolsheviks; but of course, it is far from being completely fulfilled (and it can never be completely fulfilled).
The second task that confronted our Party was to capture political power and to suppress the resistance of the exploiters. This task has not been completely fulfilled either, and it cannot be ignored because the monarchists and Constitutional-Democrats on the one hand, and their henchmen and hangers-on, the Mensheviks and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, on the other, are continuing their efforts to unite for the purpose of overthrowing Soviet power. In the main, however, the task of suppressing the resistance of the exploiters was fulfilled in the period from October 25, 1917, to (approximately) February 1918, or to the surrender of Bogayevsky.[2]
A third task is now coming to the fore as the immediate task and one which constitutes the peculiar feature of the present situation, namely, the task of organising administration of Russia. Of course, we advanced and tackled this task on the very day following October 25, 1917. Up to now, however, since the resistance of the exploiters still took the form of open civil war, up to now the task of administration could not become the main, the central task.
Now it has become the main and central task. We, the Bolshevik Party, have convinced Russia. We have won Russia from the rich for the poor, from the exploiters for the working people. Now we must administer Russia. And the whole peculiarity of the present situation, the whole difficulty, lies in understanding the specific features of the transition from the principal task of convincing the peopIe and of suppressing the exploiters by armed force to the principal task of administration.
For the first time in human history a socialist party has managed to complete in the main the conquest of power and the suppression of the exploiters, and has managed to approach directly the task of administration. We must prove worthy executors of this most difficult (and most gratifying) task of the socialist revolution. We must fully realise that in order to administer successfully, besides being able to convince people, besides being able to win a civil war, we must be able to do practical organisational work. This is the most difficult task, because it is a matter of organising in a new way the most deep-rooted, the economic, foundations of life of scores of millions of people. And it is the most gratifying task, because only after it has been fulfilled (in the principal and main outlines) will it be possible to say that Russia has become not only a Soviet, but also a socialist, republic.  The General Slogan Of The Moment The objective situation reviewed above, which has been created by the extremely onerous and unstable peace, the terrible state of ruin, the unemployment and famine we inherited from the war and the rule of the bourgeoisie (represented by Kerensky and the Mensheviks and Right Socialist-Revolutionaries who supported him), all this has inevitably caused extreme weariness and even exhaustion of wide sections of the working people. These people insistently demand—and cannot but demand—a respite. The task of the day is to restore the productive forces destroyed by the war and by bourgeois rule; to heal the wounds inflicted by the war, by the defeat in the war, by profiteering and the attempts of the bourgeoisie to restore the overthrown rule of the exploiters; to achieve economic revival; to provide reliable protection of elementary order. It may sound paradoxical, but in fact, considering the objective conditions indicated above, it is absolutely certain that at the present moment the Soviet system can secure Russia’s transition to socialism only if these very elementary, extremely elementary problems of maintaining public life are practically solved in spite of the resistance of the bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks and the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries. In view of the specific features of the present situation, and in view of the existence of Soviet power with its land socialisation law, workers’ control law, etc., the practical solution of these extremely elementary problems and the overcoming of the organisational difficulties of the first stages of progress toward socialism are now two aspects of the same picture.
Keep regular and honest accounts of money, manage economically, do not be lazy, do not steal, observe the strictest labour discipline—it is these slogans, justly scorned by the revolutionary proletariat when the bourgeoisie used them to conceal its rule as an exploiting class, that are now, since the overthrow of the bourgeoisie, becoming the immediate and the principal slogans of the moment. On the one hand, the practical application of these slogans by the mass of working people is the sole condition for the salvation of a country which has been tortured almost to death by the imperialist war and by the imperialist robbers (headed by Kerensky); on the other hand, the practical application of these slogans by the Soviet State, by its methods, on the basis of its laws, is a necessary and sufficient condition for the final victory of socialism. This is precisely what those who contemptuously brush aside the idea of putting such “hackneyed” and “trivial” slogans in the forefront fail to understand. In a small-peasant country, which overthrew tsarism only a year ago, and which liberated itself from the Kerenskys less than six months ago, there has naturally remained not a little of spontaneous anarchy, intensified by the brutality and savagery that accompany every protracted and reactionary war, and there has arisen a good deal of despair and aimless bitterness. And if we add to this the provocative policy of the lackeys of the bourgeoisie (the Mensheviks, the Right Socialist-Revolulionaries, etc.) it will become perfectly clear what prolonged and persistent efforts must be exerted by the best and the most class-conscious workers and peasants in order to bring about a complete change in the mood of the people and to bring them on to the proper path of steady and disciplined labour. Only such a transition brought about by the mass of the poor (the proletarians and semi-proletarians) can consummate the victory over the bourgeoisie and particularly over the peasant bourgeoisie, more stubborn and numerous.  The New Phase Of The Struggle Against The Bourgeoisie The bourgeoisie in our country has been conquered, but it has not yet been uprooted, not yet destroyed, and not even utterly broken. That is why we are faced with a new and higher form of struggle against the bourgeoisie, the transition from the very simple task of further expropriating the capitalists to the much more complicated and difficult task of creating conditions in which it will be impossible for the bourgeoisie to exist, or for a new bourgeoisie to arise. Clearly. this task is immeasurably more significant than the previous one; and until it is fulfilled there will be no socialism.
If we measure our revolution by the scale of West-European revolutions we shall find that at the present moment we are approximately at the level reached in 1793 and 1871. We can be legitimately proud of having risen to this level, and of having certainly, in one respect, advanced somewhat further, namely: we have decreed and introduced through out Russia the highest type of state—Soviet power. Under no circumstances, however, can we rest content with what we have achieved, because we have only just started the transition to socialism, we have not yet done the decisive thing in this respect.
The decisive thing is the organisation of the strictest and country-wide accounting and control of production and distribution of goods. And yet, we have not yet introduced accounting and control in those enterprises and in those branches and fields of economy which we have taken away from the bourgeoisie; and without this there can be no thought of achieving the second and equally essential material condition for introducing socialism, namely, raising the productivity of labour on a national scale.
That is why the present task could not be defined by the simple formula: continue the offensive against capital. Although we have certainly not finished off capital and although it is certainly necessary to continue the offensive against this enemy of the working people, such a formula would be inexact, would not be concrete, would not take into account the peculiarity of the present situation in which, in order to go on advancing successfully in the future, we must “suspend” our offensive now.
This can be explained by comparing our position in the war against capital with the position of a victorious army that has captured, say, a half or two-thirds of the enemy’s territory and is compelled to halt in order to muster its forces, to replenish its supplies of munitions, repair and reinforce the lines of communication, build new storehouses, bring up new reserves, etc. To suspend the offensive of a victorious army under such conditions is necessary precisely in order to gain the rest of the enemy’s territory, i.e., in order to achieve complete victory. Those who have failed to understand that the objective state of affairs at the present moment dictates to us precisely such a “suspension” of the offensive against capital have failed to understand anything at all about the present political situation.
It goes without saying that we can speak about the “suspension” of the offensive against capital only in quotation marks, i.e., only metaphorically. In ordinary war, a general order can be issued to stop the offensive, the advance can actually be stopped. In the war against capital, however, the advance cannot be stopped, and there can be no thought of our abandoning the further expropriation of capital. What we are discussing is the shifting of the centre of gravity of our economic and political work. Up to now measures for the direct expropriation of the expropriators were in the forefront. Now the organisation of accounting and control in those enterprises in which the capitalists have already been expropriated, and in all other enterprises, advances to the forefront.
If we decided to continue to expropriate capital at the same rate at which we have been doing it up to now, we should certainly suffer defeat, because our work of organising proletarian accounting and control has obviously— obviously to every thinking person—fallen behind the work of directly “expropriating the expropriators”. If we now concentrate all our efforts on the organisation of accounting and control, we shall be able to solve this problem, we shall be able to make up for lost time, we shall completely win our “campaign” against capital.
But is not the admission that we must make up for lost time tantamount to admission of some kind of an error? Not in the least. Take another military example. If it is possible to defeat and push back the enemy merely with detachments of light cavalry, it should be done. But if this can be done successfully only up to a certain point, then it is quite conceivable that when this point has been reached, it will be necessary to bring up heavy artillery. By admitting that it is now necessary to make up for lost time in bringing up heavy artillery, we do not admit that the successful cavalry attack was a mistake.
Frequently, the lackeys of the bourgeoisie reproached us for having launched a “Red Guard” attack on capital. The reproach is absurd and is worthy only of the lackeys of the money-bags, because at one time the “Red Guard” attack on capital was absolutely dictated by circumstances. Firstly, at that time capital put up military resistance through the medium of Kerensky and Krasnov, Savinkov and Gotz (Gegechkori is putting up such resistance even now), Dutov and Bogayevsky. Military resistance cannot be broken except by military means, and the Red Guards fought in the noble and supreme historical cause of liberating the working and exploited people from the yoke of the exploiters.
Secondly, we could not at that time put methods of administration in the forefront in place of methods of suppression, because the art of administration is not innate, but is acquired by experience. At that time we lacked this experience; now we have it. Thirdly, at that time we could not have specialists in the various fields of knowledge and technology at our disposal because those specialists were either fighting in the ranks of the Bogayevskys, or were still able to put up systematic and stubborn passive resistance by way of sabotage. Now we have broken the sabotage. The “Red Guard” attack on capital was successful, was victorious, because we broke capital’s military resistance and its resistance by sabotage.
Does that mean that a “Red Guard” attack on capital is always appropriate, under all circumstances, that we have no other means of fighting capital? It would be childish to think so. We achieved victory with the aid of light cavalry, but we also have heavy artillery. We achieved victory by methods of suppression; we shall be able to achieve victory also by methods of administration. We must know how to change our methods of fighting the enemy to suit changes in the situation. We shall not for a moment renounce “Red Guard” suppression of the Savinkovs and Gegechkoris and all other landowner and bourgeois counter-revolutionaries. We shall not be so foolish, however, as to put “Red Guard” methods in the forefront at a time when the period in which Red Guard attacks were necessary has, in the main, drawn to a close (and to a victorious close), and when the period of utilising bourgeois specialists by the proletarian state power for the purpose of reploughing the soil in order to prevent the growth of any bourgeoisie whatever is knocking at the door.
This is a peculiar epoch, or rather stage of development, and in order to defeat capital completely, we must be able to adapt the forms of our struggle to the peculiar conditions of this stage.
Without the guidance of experts in the various fields of knowledge, technology and experience, the transition to socialism will be impossible, because socialism calls for a conscious mass advance to greater productivity of labour compared with capitalism, and on the basis achieved by capitalism. Socialism must achieve this advance in its own way, by its own methods—or, to put it more concretely, by Soviet methods. And the specialists, because of the whole social environment which made them specialists, are, in the main, inevitably bourgeois. Had our proletariat, after capturing power, quickly solved the problem of accounting, control and organisation on a national scale (which was impossible owing to the war and Russia’s backwardness), then we, after breaking the sabotage, would also have completely subordinated these bourgeois experts to ourselves by means of universal accounting and control. Owing to the considerable “delay” in introducing accounting and control generally, we, although we have managed to conquer sabotage, have not yet created the conditions which would place the bourgeois specialists at our disposal. The mass of saboteurs are “going to work”, but the best organisers and the top experts can be utilised by the state either in the old way, in the bourgeois way (i.e., for high salaries), or in the new way, in the proletarian way (i.e., creating the conditions of national accounting and control from below, which would inevitably and of itself subordinate the experts and enlist them for our work).
Now we have to resort to the old bourgeois method and to agree to pay a very high price for the “services” of the top bourgeois experts. All those who are familiar with the subject appreciate this, but not all ponder over the significance of this measure being adopted by the proletarian state. Clearly, this measure is a compromise, a departure from the principles of the Paris Commune and of every proletarian power, which call for the reduction of all salaries to the level of the wages of the average worker, which urge that careerism be fought not merely in words, but in deeds.
Moreover, it is clear that this measure not only implies the cessation—in a certain field and to a certain degree—of the offensive against capital (for capital is not a sum of money, but a definite social relation); it is also a step backward on the part of our socialist Soviet state power, which from the very outset proclaimed and pursued the policy of reducing high salaries to the level of the wages of the average worker.[3]
Of course, the lackeys of the bourgeoisie, particularly the small fry, such as the Mensheviks, the Novaya Zhizn people and the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, will giggle over our confession that we are taking a step backward. But we need not mind their giggling. We must study the specific features of the extremely difficult and new path to socialism without concealing our mistakes and weaknesses, and try to be prompt in doing what has been left undone. To conceal from the people the fact that the enlistment of bourgeois experts by means of extremely high salaries is a retreat from the principles of the Paris Commune would be sinking to the level of bourgeois politicians and deceiving the people. Frankly explaining how and why we took this step backward, and then publicly discussing what means are available for making up for lost time, means educating the people and learning from experience, learning together with the people how to build socialism. There is hardly a single victorious military campaign in history in which the victor did not commit certain mistakes, suffer partial reverses, temporarily yield something and in some places retreat. The “campaign” which we have undertaken against capitalism is a million times more difficult than the most difficult military campaign, and it would be silly and disgraceful to give way to despondency because of a particular and partial retreat.
We shall now discuss the question from the practical point of view. Let us assume that the Russian Soviet Republic requires one thousand first-class scientists and experts in various fields of knowledge, technology and practical experience to direct the labour of the people towards securing the speediest possible economic revival. Let us assume also that we shall have to pay these “stars of the first magnitude"—of course the majority of those who shout loudest about the corruption of the workers are themselves utterly corrupted by bourgeois morals—25,000 rubles per annum each. Let us assume that this sum (25,000,000 rubles) will have to be doubled (assuming that we have to pay bonuses for particularly successful and rapid fulfilment of the most important organisational and technical tasks), or even quadrupled (assuming that we have to enlist several hundred foreign specialists, who are more demanding). The question is, would the annual expenditure of fifty or a hundred million rubles by the Soviet Republic for the purpose of reorganising the labour of the people on modern scientific and technological lines be excessive or too heavy? Of course not. The overwhelming majority of the class-conscious workers and peasants will approve of this expenditure because they know from practical experience that our backwardness causes us to lose thousands of millions, and that we have not yet reached that degree of organisation, accounting and control which would induce all the “stars” of the bourgeois intelligentsia to participate voluntarily in our work.
It goes without saying that this question has another side to it. The corrupting influence of high salaries—both upon the Soviet authorities (especially since the revolution occurred so rapidly that it was impossible to prevent a certain number of adventurers and rogues from getting into positions of authority, and they, together with a number of inept or dishonest commissars, would not be averse to becoming “star” embezzlers of state funds) and upon the mass of the workers—is indisputable. Every thinking and honest worker and poor peasant, however, will agree with us, will admit, that we cannot immediately rid ourselves of the evil legacy of capitalism, and that we can liberate the Soviet Republic from the duty of paying an annual “tribute” of fifty million or one hundred million rubles (a tribute for our own-backwardness in organising country-wide accounting and control from below ) only by organising ourselves, by tightening up discipline in our own ranks, by purging our ranks of all those who are “preserving the legacy of capitalism”, who “follow the traditions of capitalism”, i.e., of idlers, parasites and embezzlers of statefunds (now all the land, all the factories and all the railways are the “state funds” of the Soviet Republic). If the class-conscious advanced workers and poor peasants manage with the aid of the Soviet institutions to organise, become disciplined, pull themselves together, create powerful labour discipline in the course of one year, then in a year’s time we shall throw off this “tribute”, which can be reduced even before that . . . in exact proportion to the successes we achieve in our workers’ and peasants’ labour discipline and organisation. The sooner we ourselves, workers and peasants, learn the best labour discipline and the most modern technique of labour, using the bourgeois experts to teach us, the sooner we shall liberate ourselves from any “tribute” to these specialists.
Our work of organising country-wide accounting and control of production and distribution under the supervision of the proletariat has lagged very much behind our work of directly expropriating the expropriators. This proposition is of fundamental importance for understanding the specific features of the present situation and the tasks of the Soviet government that follow from it. The centre of gravity of our struggle against the bourgeoisie is shifting to the organisation of such accounting and control. Only with this as our starting-point will it be possible to determine correctly the immediate tasks of economic and financial policy in the sphere of nationalisation of the banks, monopolisation of foreign trade, the state control of money circulation, the introduction of a property and income tax satisfactory from the proletarian point of view, and the introduction of compulsory labour service.
We have been lagging very far behind in introducing socialist reforms in these spheres (very, very important spheres), and this is because accounting and control are insufficiently organised in general. It goes without saying that this is one of the most difficult tasks, and in view of the ruin caused by the war, it can be fulfilled only over a long period of time; but we must not forget that it is precisely here that the bourgeoisie—and particularly the numerous petty and peasant bourgeoisie—are putting up the most serious fight, disrupting the control that is already being organised, disrupting the grain monopoly, for example, and gaining positions for profiteering and speculative trade. We have far from adequately carried out the things we have decreed, and the principal task of the moment is to concentrate all efforts on the businesslike, practical realisation of the principles of the reforms which have already become law (but not yet reality).
In order to proceed with the nationalisation of the banks and to go on steadfastly towards transforming the banks into nodal points of public accounting under socialism, we must first of all, and above all, achieve real success in increasing the number of branches of the People’s Bank, in attracting deposits, in simplifying the paying in and withdrawal of deposits by the public, in abolishing queues, in catching and shooting bribe-takers and rogues, etc. At first we must really carry out the simplest things, properly organise what is available, and then prepare for the more intricate things.
Consolidate and improve the state monopolies (in grain, leather, etc.) which have already been introduced, and by doing so prepare for the state monopoly of foreign trade. Without this monopoly we shall not be able to “free ourselves” from foreign capital by paying “tribute”.[4] And the possibility of building up socialism depends entirely upon whether we shall be able, by paying a certain tribute to foreign capital during a certain transitional period, to safeguard our internal economic independence.
We are also lagging very far behind in regard to the collection of taxes generally, and of the property and income tax in particular. The imposing of indemnities upon the bourgeoisie—a measure which in principle is absolutely permissible and deserves proletarian approval—shows that in this respect we are still nearer to the methods of warfare (to win Russia from the rich for the poor) than to the methods of administration. In order to become stronger, however, and in order to be able to stand firmer on our feet, we must adopt the latter methods, we must substitute for the indemnities imposed upon the bourgeoisie the constant and regular collection of a property and income tax, which will bring a greater return to the proletarian state, and which calls for better organisation on our part and better accounting and control.[5]
The fact that we are late in introducing compulsory labour service also shows that the work that is coming to the fore at the present time is precisely the preparatory organisational work that, on the one hand, will finally consolidate our gains and that, on the other, is necessary in order to prepare for the operation of “surrounding” capital and compelling it to “surrender”. We ought to begin introducing compulsory labour service immediately, but we must do so very gradually and circumspectly, testing every step by practical experience, and, of course, taking the first step by introducing compulsory labour service for the rich. The introduction of work and consumers’ budget books for every bourgeois, including every rural bourgeois, would be an important step towards completely “surrounding” the enemy and towards the creation of a truly popular accounting and control of the production and distribution of goods.  The Significance Of The Struggle For Country-Wide Accounting And Control The state, which for centuries has been an organ for oppression and robbery of the people, has left us a legacy of the people’s supreme hatred and suspicion of everything that is connected with the state. It is very difficult to overcome this, and only a Soviet government can do it. Even a Soviet government, however, will require plenty of time and enormous perseverance to accomplish it. This “legacy” is especially apparent in the problem of accounting and control—the fundamental problem facing the socialist revolution on the  morrow of the overthrow of the bourgeoisie. A certain amount of time will inevitably pass before the people, who feel free for the first time now that the landowners and the bourgeoisie have been overthrown, will understand—not from books, but from their own, Soviet experience—will understand and feel that without comprehensive state accounting and control of the production and distribution of goods, the power of the working people, the freedom of the working people, cannot be maintained, and that a return to the yoke of capitalism is inevitable.
All the habits and traditions of the bourgeoisie, and of the petty bourgeoisie in particular, also oppose state control, and uphold the inviolability of “sacred private property”, of “sacred” private enterprise. It is now particularly clear to us how correct is the Marxist thesis that anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism are bourgeois trends, how irreconcilably opposed they are to socialism, proletarian dictatorship and communism. The fight to instill into the people’s minds the idea of Soviet state control and accounting, and to carry out this idea in practice; the fight to break with the rotten past, which taught the people to regard the procurement of bread and clothes as a “private” affair, and buying and selling as a transaction “which concerns only myself"—is a great fight of world-historic significance, a fight between socialist consciousness and bourgeois-anarchist spontaneity.
We have introduced workers’ control as a law, but this law is only just beginning to operate and is only just beginning to penetrate the minds of broad sections of the proletariat. In our agitation we do not sufficiently explain that lack of accounting and control in the production and distribution of goods means the death of the rudiments of socialism, means the embezzlement of state funds (for all property belongs to the state and the state is the Soviet state in which power belongs to the majority of the working people). We do not sufficiently explain that carelessness in accounting and control is downright aiding and abetting the German and the Russian Kornilovs, who can overthrow the power of the working people only if we fail to cope with the task of accounting and control, and who, with the aid of the whole of the rural bourgeoisie, with the aid of the Constitutional-Democrats, the Mensheviks and the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, are “watching” us and waiting for an opportune moment to attack us. And the advanced workers and peasants do not think and speak about this sufficiently. Until workers’ control has become a fact, until the advanced workers have organised and carried out a victorious and ruthless crusade against the violators of this control, or against those who are careless in matters of control, it will be impossible to pass from the first step (from workers’ control) to the second step towards socialism, i.e., to pass on to workers’ regulation of production.
The socialist state can arise only as a network of producers’ and consumers’ communes, which conscientiously keep account of their production and consumption, economise on labour, and steadily raise the productivity of labour, thus making it possible to reduce the working day to seven, six and even fewer hours. Nothing will be achieved unless the strictest, country-wide, comprehensive accounting and control of grain and the production of grain (and later of all other essential goods) are set going. Capitalism left us a legacy of mass organisations which can facilitate our transition to the mass accounting and control of the distribution of goods, namely, the consumers’ co-operative societies. In Russia these societies are not so well developed as in the advanced countries, nevertheless, they have over ten million members. The Decree on Consumers’ Co-operative Societies,[6] issued the other day, is an extremely significant phenomenon, which strikingly illustrates the peculiar position and the specific tasks of the Soviet Socialist Republic at the present moment.
The decree is an agreement with the bourgeois co-operative societies and the workers’ co-operative societies which still adhere to the bourgeois point of view. It is an agreement, or compromise, firstly because the representatives of the above-mentioned institutions not only took part in discussing the decree, but actually had a decisive say in the matter, for the parts of the decree which were strongly opposed by these institutions were dropped. Secondly, the essence of the compromise is that the Soviet government has abandoned the principle of admission of new members to co-operative societies without entrance fees (which is the only consistently proletarian principle); it has also abandoned the idea of uniting the whole population of a given locality in a single co-operative society. Contrary to this principle, which is the only socialist principle and which corresponds to the task of abolishing classes, the “working-class co-operative societies” (which in this case call themselves “class” societies only because they subordinate themselves to the class interests of the bourgeoisie) were given the right to continue to exist. Finally, the Soviet government’s proposal to expel the bourgeoisie entirely from the boards of the co-operative societies was also considerably modified, and only owners of private capitalist trading and industrial enterprises were forbidden to serve on the boards.
Had the proletariat, acting through the Soviet government, managed to organise accounting and control on a national scale, or at least laid the foundation for such control, it would not have been necessary to make such compromises. Through the food departments of the Soviets, through the supply organisations under the Soviets we should have organised the population into a single co-operative society under proletarian management. We should have done this without the assistance of the bourgeois co-operative societies, without making any concession to the purely bourgeois principle which prompts the workers’ co-operative societies to remain workers’ societies side by side with bourgeois societies, instead of subordinating these bourgeois co-operative societies entirely to themselves, merging the two together and taking the entire management of the society and the supervision of the consumption of the rich in their own hands.
In concluding such an agreement with the bourgeois co-operative societies, the Soviet government concretely defined its tactical aims and its peculiar methods of action in the present stage of development as follows: by directing the bourgeois elements, utilising them, making certain partial concessions to them, we create the conditions for further progress that will be slower than we at first anticipated, but surer, with the base and lines of communication better secured and with the positions which have been won better consolidated. The Soviets can (and should ) now gauge their successes in the field of socialist construction, among other things, by extremely clear, simple and practical standards, namely, in how many communities (communes or villages, or blocks of houses, etc.) co-operative societies have been organised, and to what extent their development has reached the point of embracing the whole population .
 Raising the Productivity of Labour In every socialist revolution, after the proletariat has solved the problem of capturing power, and to the extent that the task of expropriating the expropriators and suppressing their resistance has been carried out in the main, there necessarily comes to the forefront the fundamental task of creating a social system superior to capitalism, namely, raising the productivity of labour, and in this connection (and for this purpose) securing better organisation of labour. Our Soviet state is precisely in the position where, thanks to the victories over the exploiters—from Kerensky to Kornilov—it is able to approach this task directly, to tackle it in earnest. And here it becomes immediately clear that while it is possible to take over the central government in a few days, while it is possible to suppress the military resistance (and sabotage) of the exploiters even in different parts of a great country in a few weeks, the capital solution of the problem of raising the productivity of labour requires, at all events (particularly after a most terrible and devastating war), several years. The protracted nature of the work is certainly dictated by objective circumstances.
The raising of the productivity of labour first of all requires that the material basis of large-scale industry shall be assured, namely, the development of the production of fuel, iron, the engineering and chemical industries. The Russian Soviet Republic enjoys the favourable position of having at its command, even after the Brest peace, enormous reserves of ore (in the Urals), fuel in Western Siberia (coal), in the Caucasus and the South-East (oil), in Central Russia (peat), enormous timber reserves, water power, raw materials for the chemical industry (Karabugaz), etc. The development of these natural resources by methods of modern technology will provide the basis for the unprecedented progress of the productive forces.
Another condition for raising the productivity of labour is, firstly, the raising of the educational and cultural level of the mass of the population. This is now taking place extremely rapidly, a fact which those who are blinded by bourgeois routine are unable to see; they are unable to understand what an urge towards enlightenment and initiative is now developing among the “lower ranks” of the people thanks to the Soviet form of organisation. Secondly, a condition for economic revival is the raising of the working people’s discipline, their skill, the effectiveness, the intensity of labour and its better organisation.
In this respect the situation is particularly bad and even hopeless if we are to believe those who have allowed themselves to be intimidated by the bourgeoisie or by those who are serving the bourgeoisie for their own ends. These people do not understand that there has not been, nor could there be, a revolution in which the supporters of the old system did not raise a howl about chaos, anarchy, etc. naturally, among the people who have only just thrown off an unprecedentedly savage yoke there is deep and widespread seething and ferment; the working out of new principles of labour discipline by the people is a very protracted process, and this process could not even start until complete victory had been achieved over the landowners and the bourgeoisie.
We, however, without in the least yielding to the despair (it is often false despair) which is spread by the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intellectuals (who have despaired of retaining their old privileges), must under no circumstances conceal an obvious evil. On the contrary, we shall expose it and intensify the Soviet methods of combating it, because the victory of socialism is inconceivable without the victory of proletarian conscious discipline over spontaneous petty-bourgeois anarchy, this real guarantee of a possible restoration of Kerenskyism and Kornilovism.
The more class-conscious vanguard of the Russian proletariat has already set itself the task of raising labour discipline. For example, both the Central Committee of the Metalworkers’ Union and the Central Council of Trade Unions have begun to draft the necessary measures and decrees.[7]This work must be supported and pushed ahead with all speed. We must raise the question of piece-work[8] and apply and test it in practice; we must raise the question of applying much of what is scientific and progressive in the Taylor system; we must make wages correspond to the total amount of goods turned out, or to the amount of work done by the railways, the water transport system, etc., etc.
The Russian is a bad worker compared with people in advanced countries. It could not be otherwise under the tsarist regime and in view of the persistence of the hangover from serfdom. The task that the Soviet government must set the people in all its scope is—learn to work. The Taylor system, the last word of capitalism in this respect, like all capitalist progress, is a combination of the refined brutality of bourgeois exploitation and a number of the greatest scientific achievements in the field of analysing mechanical motions during work, the elimination of superfluous and awkward motions, the elaboration of correct methods of work, the introduction of the best system of accounting and control, etc. The Soviet Republic must at all costs adopt all that is valuable in the achievements of science and technology in this field. The possibility of building socialism depends exactly upon our success in combining the Soviet power and the Soviet organisation of administration with the up-to-date achievements of capitalism. We must organise in Russia the study and teaching of the Taylor system and systematically try it out and adapt it to our own ends. At the same time, in working to raise the productivity of labour, we must take into account the specific features of the transition period from capitalism to socialism, which, on the one hand, require that the foundations be laid of the socialist organisation of competition, and, on the other hand, require the use of compulsion, so that the slogan of the dictatorship of the proletariat shall not be desecrated by the practice of a lily-livered proletarian government.

The Organisation Of Competition Among the absurdities which the bourgeoisie are fond of spreading about socialism is the allegation that socialists deny the importance of competition. In fact, it is only socialism which, by abolishing classes, and, consequently, by abolishing the enslavement of the people, for the first time opens the way for competition on a really mass scale. And it is precisely the Soviet form of organisation, by ensuring transition from the formal democracy of the bourgeois republic to real participation of the mass of working people in administration, that for the first time puts competition on a broad basis. It is much easier to organise this in the political field than in the economic field; but for the success of socialism, it is the economic field that matters.
Take, for example, a means of organising competition such as publicity. The bourgeois republic ensures publicity only formally; in practice, it subordinates the press to capital, entertains the “mob” with sensationalist political trash and conceals what takes place in the workshops, in commercial transactions, contracts, etc., behind a veil of “trade secrets”, which protect “the sacred right of property”. The Soviet government has abolished trade secrets[9]; it has taken a new path; but we have done hardly anything to utilise publicity for the purpose of encouraging economic competition. While ruthlessly suppressing the thoroughly mendacious and insolently slanderous bourgeois press, we must set to work systematically to create a press that will not entertain and fool the people with political sensation and trivialities, but which will submitthe questions of everyday economic life to the people’s judgement and assist in the serious study of these questions. Every factory, every village is a producers’ and consumers’ commune, whose right and duty it is to apply the general Soviet laws in their own way ("in their own way”, not in the sense of violating them, but in the sense that they can apply them in various forms) and in their own way to solve the problem of accounting in the production and distribution of goods. Under capitalism, this was the Ã¢“private affairÃ¢” of the individual capitalist, landowner or kulak. Under the Soviet system, it is not a private affair, but a most important affair of state.
We have scarcely yet started on the enormous, difficult but rewarding task of organising competition between communes, of introducing accounting and publicity in the process of the production of grain, clothes and other things, of transforming dry, dead, bureaucratic accounts into living examples, some repulsive, others attractive. Under the capitalist mode of production, the significance of individual example, say the example of a co-operative workshop, was inevitably very much restricted, and only those imbued with petty-bourgeois illusions could dream of "correcting” capitalisim through the example of virtuous institutions. After political power has passed to the proletariat, after the expropriators have been expropriated, the situation radically changes andeas prominent socialists have repeatedly pointed out—force of example for the first time is able to influence the people. Model communes must and will serve as educators, teachers, helping to raise the backward communes. The press must serve as an instrument of socialist construction, give publicity to the successes achieved by the model communes in all their details, must study the causes of these successes, the methods of management these communes employ, and, on the other hand, must put on the “black list” those communes which persist in the “traditions of capitalism”, i.e., anarchy, laziness, disorder and profiteering. In capitalist society, statistics were entirely a matter for “government servants”, or for narrow specialists; we must carry statistics to the people and make them popular so that the working people themselves may gradually learn to understand and see how long and in what way it is necessary to work, how much time and in what way one may rest, so that the comparison of the business results of the various communes may become a matter of general interest and study, and that the most outstanding communes may be rewarded immediately (by reducing the working day, raising remuneration, placing a larger amount of cultural or aesthetic facilities or values at their disposal, etc.).
When a new class comes on to the historical scene as the leader and guide of society, a period of violent “rocking”, shocks, struggle and storm, on the one hand, and a period of uncertain steps, experiments, wavering, hesitation in regard to the selection of new methods corresponding to new objective circumstances, On the other, are inevitable. The moribund feudal nobility avenged themselves on the bourgeoisie which vanquished them and took their place, not only by conspiracies and attempts at rebellion and restoration, but also by pouring ridicule over the lack of skill, the clumsiness and the mistakes of the “upstarts” and the “insolent” who dared to take over the “sacred helm” of state without the centuries of training which the princes, barons, nobles and dignitaries had had; in exactly the same way the Kornilovs and Kerenskys, the Gotzes and Martovs, the whole of that fraternity of heroes of bourgeois swindling or bourgeois scepticism, avenge themselves on the working class of Russia for having had the “audacity” to take power.
Of course, not weeks, but long months and years are required for a new social class, especially a class which up to now has been oppressed and crushed by poverty and ignorance, to get used to its new position, look around, organise its work and promote its own organisers. It is understandable that the Party which leads the revolutionary proletariat has not been able to acquire the experience and habits of large organisational undertakings embracing millions and tens of millions of citizens; the remoulding of the old, almost exclusively agitators’ habits is a very lengthy process. But there is nothing impossible in this, and as soon as the necessity for a change is clearly appreciated, as soon as there is firm determination to effect the change and perseverance in pursuing a great and difficult aim, we shall achieve it. There is an enormous amount of organising talent among the “people”, i.e., among the workers and the peasants who do not exploit the labour of others. Capital crushed these talented people in thousands; it killed their talent and threw them on to the scrap-heap. We are not yet able to find them, encourage them, put them on their feet, promote them. But we shall learn to do so if we set about it with all-out revolutionary enthusiasm, without which there can be no victorious revolutions.
No profound and mighty popular movement has ever occurred in history without dirty scum rising to the top, without adventurers and rogues, boasters and ranters attaching themselves to the inexperienced innovators, without absurd muddle and fuss, without individual “leaders” trying to deal with twenty matters at once and not finishing any of them. Let the lap-dogs of bourgeois society, from Belorussov to Martov, squeal and yelp about every extra chip that is sent flying in cutting down the big, old wood. What else are lap-dogs for if not to yelp at the proletarian elephant? Let them yelp. We shall go our way and try as carefully and as patiently as possible to test and discover real organisers, people with sober and practical minds, people who combine loyally to socialism with ability without fuss (and in spite of muddle and fuss) to get a large number of people working together steadily and concertedly within the framework of Soviet organisation. Only such people, after they have been tested a dozen times, by being transferred from the simplest to the more difficult tasks, should be promoted to the responsible posts of leaders of the people’s labour, leaders of administration. We have not yet learned to do this, but we shall learn.

“Harmonious Organisation” And Dictatorship The resolution adopted by the recent Moscow Congress of Soviets advanced as the primary task of the moment the establishment of a “harmonious organisation”, and the tightening of discipline.[See also Resolution On Ratification Of The Brest Treaty—Editor.] Everyone now readily “votes for” and “subscribes to” resolutions of this kind; but usually people do not think over the fact that the application of such resolutions calls for coercion—coercion precisely in the form of dictatorship. And yet it would be extremely stupid and ahsurdly utopian to assume that the transition from capitalism to socialism is possible without coercion and without dictatorship. Marx’s theory very definitely opposed this petty-bourgeois-democratic and anarchist absurdity long ago. And Russia of 1917-18 confirms the correctness of Marx’s theory in this respect so strikingly, palpably and imposingly that only those who are hopelessly dull or who have obstinately decided to turn thelr backs on the truth can be under any misapprehension concerning this. Either the dictatorship of Kornilov (if we take him as the Russian type of bourgeois Cavaignac), or the dictatorship of the proletariat—any other choice is out of the question for a country which is developing at an extremely rapid rate with extremely sharp turns and amidst desperate ruin created by one of the most horrible wars in history. Every solution that offers a middle path is either a deception of the people by the bourgeoisie—for the bourgeoisie dare not tell the truth, dare not say that they need Kornilov—or an expression of the dull-wittedness of the petty-bourgeois democrats, of the Chernovs, Tseretelis and Martovs, who chatter about the unity of democracy, the dictatorship of democracy, the general democratic front, and similar nonsense. Those whom even the progress of the Russian Revolution of 1917-18 has not taught that a middle course is impossible, must be given up for lost.  
On the other hand, it is not difficult to see that during every transition from capitalism to socialism, dictatorship is necessary for two main reasons, or along two main channels. Firstly, capitalism cannot be defeated and eradicated without the ruthless suppression of the resistance of the exploiters, who cannot at once be deprived of their wealth, of their advantages of organisation and knowledge, and consequently for a fairly long period will inevitably try to overthrow the hated rule of the poor; secondly, every great revolution, and a socialist revolution in particular, even if there is no external war, is inconceivable without internal war, i.e., civil war, which is even more devastating than external war, and involves thousands and millions of cases of wavering and desertion from one side to another, implies a state of extreme indefiniteness, lack of equilibirium and chaos. And of course, all the elements of disintegration of the old society, which are inevitably very numerous and connected mainly with the petty bourgeoisie (because it is the petty bourgeoisie that every war and every crisis ruins and destroys first), are bound to “reveal themselves” during such a profound revolution. And these elements of disintegration cannot “reveal themselves” otherwise than in an increase of crime, hooliganism, corruption, profiteering and outrages of every kind. To put these down requires time and requires an iron hand.
There has not been a single great revolution in history in which the people did not instinctively realise this and did not show salutary firmness by shooting thieves on the spot. The misfortune of previous revolutions was that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people, which sustained them in their state of tension and gave them the strength to suppress ruthlessly the elements of disintegration, did not last long. The social, i.e., the class, reason for this instability of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people was the weakness of the proletariat, which alone is able (if it is sufficiently numerous, class-conscious and disciplined) to win over to its side the majority of the working and exploited people (the majority of the poor, to speak more simply and popularly) and retain power sufficiently long to suppress completely all the exploiters as well as all the elements of disintegration.
It was this historical experience of all revolutions, it was this world-historic—economic and political—lesson that Marx summed up when he gave his short, sharp, concise and expressive formula: dictatorship of the proletariat. And the fact that the Russian revolution has been correct in its approach to this world-historic task has been proved by the victorious progress of the Soviet form of organisation among all the peoples and tongues of Russia. For Soviet power is nothing but an organisational form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the dictatorship of the advanced class, which raises to a new democracy and to independent participation in the administration of the state tens upon tens of millions of working and exploited peoples who by their own experience learn to regard the disciplined and class-conscious vanguard of the proletariat as their most reliable leader.
Dictatorship, however, is a big word, and big words should not be thrown about carelessly. Dictatorship is iron rule, government that is revolutionarily bold, swift and ruthless in suppressing both exploiters and hooligans. But our government is excessively mild, very often it resembles jelly more than iron. We must not forget for a moment that the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois element is fighting against the Soviet system in two ways; on the one hand, it is operating from without, by the methods of the Savinkovs, Gotzes, Gegechkoris and Kornilovs, by conspiracies and rebellions, and by their filthy “ideological” reflection, the flood of lies and slander in the Constitutional-Democratic, Right Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik press; on the other hand, this element operates from within and takes advantage of every manifestation of disintegration, of every weakness, in order to bribe, to increase indiscipline, laxity and chaos. The nearer we approach the complete military suppression of the bourgeoisie, the more dangerous does the element of petty-bourgeois anarchy become. And the fight against this element cannot be waged solely with the aid of propaganda and agitation, solely by organising competition and by selecting organisers. The struggle must also be waged by means of coercion.
As the fundamental task of the government becomes, not military suppression, but administration, the typical manifestation of suppression and compulsion will be, not shooting on the spot, but trial by court. In this respect also the revolutionary people after October 25, 1917 took the right path and demonstrated the viability of the revolution by setting up their own workers’ and peasants’ courts, even before the decrees dissolving the bourgeois bureaucratic judiciary were passed. But our revolutionary and people’s courts are extremely, incredibly weak. One feels that we have not yet done away with the people’s attitude towards the courts as towards something official and alien, an attitude inherited from the yoke of the landowners and of the bourgeoisie. It is not yet sufficiently realised that the courts are an organ which enlists precisely the poor, every one of them, in the work of state administration (for the work of the courts is one of the functions of state administration), that the courts are an organ of the power of the proletariat and of the poor peasants, that the courts are an instrument for inculcating discipline. There is not yet sufficient appreciation of the simple and obvious fact that if the principal misfortunes of Russia at the present time are hunger and unemployment, these misfortunes cannot be overcome by spurts, but only by comprehensive, all-embracing, country-wide organisation and discipline in order to increase the output of bread for the people and bread for industry (fuel), to transport these in good time to the places where they are required, and to distribute them properly; and it is not fully appreciated that, consequently, it is those who violate labour discipline at any factory, in any undertaking, in any matter, who are responsible for the sufferings caused by the famine and unemployment, that we must know how to find the guilty ones, to bring them to trial and ruthlessly punish them. Where the petty-bourgeois anarchy against which we must now wage a most persistent struggle makes itself felt is in the failure to appreciate the economic and political connection between famine and unemployment, on the one hand, and general laxity in matters of organisation and discipline, on the other—in the tenacity of the small-proprietor outlook, namely, I’ll grab all I can for myself; the rest can go hang.
In the rail transport service, which perhaps most strikingly embodies the economic ties of an organism created by large-scale capitalism, the struggle between the element of petty-bourgeois laxity and proletarian organisation is particularly evident. The “administrative” elements provide a host of saboteurs and bribe-takers; the best part of the proletarian elements fight for discipline; but among both elements there are, of course, many waverers and “weak” characters who are unable to withstand the “temptation” of profiteering, bribery, personal gain obtained by spoiling the whole apparatus, upon the proper working of which the victory over famine and unemployment depends.
The struggle that has been developing around the recent decree on the management of the railways, the decree which grants individual executives dictatorial powers (or “unlimited” powers),[10] is characteristic. The conscious (and to a large extent, probably, unconscious) representatives of petty bourgeois laxity would like to see in this granting of “unlimited” (i.e., dictatorial) powers to individuals a departure from the collegiate principle, from democracy and from the principles of Soviet government. Here and there, among Left Socialist-RevoIutionaries, a positively hooligan agitation, i.e., agitation appealing to the base instincts and to the small proprietor’s urge to “grab all he can”, has been developed against the dictatorship decree. The question has become one of really enormous significance. Firstly, the question of principle, namely, is the appointment of individuals, dictators with unlimited powers, in general compatible with the fundamental principles of Soviet government? Secondly, what relation has this case—this precedent, if you will—to the special tasks of government in the present concrete situation? We must deal very thoroughly with both these questions.
That in the history of revolutionary movements the dictatorship of individuals was very often the expression, the vehicle, the channel of the dictatorship of the revolutionary classes has been shown by the irrefutable experience of history. Undoubtedly, the dictatorship of individuals was compatible with bourgeois democracy. On this point, how ever, the bourgeois denigrators of the Soviet system, as well as their petty-bourgeois henchmen, always display sleight of hand: on the one hand, they declare the Soviet system to be something absurd, anarchistic and savage, and carefully pass over in silence all our historical examples and theoretical arguments which prove that the Soviets are a higher form of democracy, and what is more, the beginning of a socialist form of democracy; on the other hand, they demand of us a higher democracy than bourgeois democracy and say: personal dictatorship is absolutely incompatible with your, Bolshevik (i.e., not bourgeois, but socialist ), Soviet democracy.
These are exceedingly poor arguments. If we are not anarchists, we must admit that the state, that is, coercion, is necessary for the transition from capitalism to socialism. The form of coercion is determined by the degree of development of the given revolutionary class, and also by special circumstances, such as, for example, the legacy of a long and reactionary war and the forms of resistance put up by the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie. There is, therefore, absolutely no contradiction in principle between Soviet (that is, socialist) democracy and the exercise of dictatorial powers by individuals. The difference between proletarian dictatorship and bourgeois dictatorship is that the former strikes at the exploiting minority in the interests of the exploited majority, and that it is exercised—also through individuals—not only by the working and exploited people, but also by organisations which are built in such a way as to rouse these people to history-making activity. (The Soviet organisations are organisations of this kind.)
In regard to the second question, concerning the significance of individual dictatorial powers from the point of view of the specific tasks of the present moment, it must be said that large-scale machine industry—which is precisely the material source, the productive source, the foundation of socialism—calls for absolute and strict unity of will, which directs the joint labours of hundreds, thousands and tens of thousands of people. The technical, economic and historical necessity of this is obvious, and all those who have thought about socialism have always regarded it as one of the conditions of socialism. But how can strict unity of will be ensured? By thousands subordinating their will to the will of one.
Given ideal class-consciousness and discipline on the part of those participating in the common work, this subordination would be something like the mild leadership of a conductor of an orchestra. It may assume the sharp forms of a dictatorship if ideal discipline and class-consciousness are lacking. But be that as it may, unquestioning subordination to a single will is absolutely necessary for the success of processes organised on the pattern of large-scale machine industry. On the railways it is twice and three times as necessary. In this transition from one political task to another, which on the surface is totally dissimilar to the first, lies the whole originality of the present situation. The revolution has only just smashed the oldest, strongest and heaviest of fetters, to which the people submitted under duress. That was yesterday. Today, however, the same revolution demands—precisely in the interests of its development and consolidation, precisely in the interests of socialism—that the people unquestioningly obey the single will of the leaders of labour. Of course, such a transition cannot be made at one step. Clearly, it can be achieved only as a result of tremendous jolts, shocks, reversions to old ways, the enormous exertion of effort on the part of the proletarian vanguard, which is leading the people to the new ways. Those who drop into the philistine hysterics of Novaya Zhizn or Vperyod,[11] Dyelo Naroda or [12] do not stop to think about this.
Take the psychology of the average, ordinary representative of the toiling and exploited masses, compare it with the objective, material conditions of his life in society. Before the October Revolution he did not see a single instance of the propertied, exploiting classes making any real sacrifice for him, giving up anything for his benefit. He did not see them giving him the land and liberty that had been repeatedly promised him, giving him peace, sacrificing “Great Power” interests and the interests of Great Power secret treaties, sacrificing capital and profits. He saw this only after October 25, 1917, when he took it himself by force, and had to defend by force what he had taken, against the Kerenskys, Gotzes, Gegechkoris, Dutovs and Kornilovs. Naturally, for a certain time, all his attention, all his thoughts, all his spiritual strength, were concentrated on taking a breath, on unbending his back, on straightening his shoulders, on taking the blessings of life that were there for the taking, and that had always been denied him by the now overthrown exploiters. Of course, a certain amount of time is required to enable the ordinary working man not only to see for himself, not only to become convinced, but also to feel that he cannot simply “take”, snatch, grab things, that this leads to increased disruption, to ruin, to the return of the Kornilovs. The corresponding change in the conditions of life (and consequently in the psychology) of the ordinary working men is only just beginning. And our whole task, the task of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which is the class-conscious spokesman for the strivings of the exploited for emancipation, is to appreciate this change, to understand that it is necessary, to stand at the head of the exhausted people who are wearily seeking a way out and lead them along the true path, along the path of labour discipline, along the path of co-ordinating the task of arguing at mass meetings about the conditions of work with the task of unquestioningly obeying the will of the Soviet leader, of the dictator, during the work.
The “mania for meetings” is an object of the ridicule, and still more often of the spiteful hissing of the bourgeoisie, the Mensheviks, the Novaya Zhizn people, who see only the chaos, the confusion and the outbursts of small-proprietor egoism. But without the discussions at public meetings the mass of the oppressed could never have changed from the discipline forced upon them by the exploiters to conscious, voluntary discipline. The airing of questions at public meetings is the genuine democracy of the working people, their way of unbending their backs, their awakening to a new life, their first steps along the road which they themselves have cleared of vipers (the exploiters, the imperialists, the landowners and capitalists) and which they want to learn to build themselves, in their own way, for themselves, on the principles of their own Soviet, and not alien, not aristocratic, not bourgeois rule. It required precisely the October victory of the working people over the exploiters, it required a whole historical period in wllich the workillg people themselves could first of all discuss the new conditions of life and the new tasks, in order to make possible the durable transition to superior forms of labour discipline, to the conscious appreciation of the necessity for the dictatorship of the proletariat, to unquestioning obedience to the orders of individual representatives of the Soviet government during the work.
This transition has now begun.
We have successfully fulfilled the first task of the revolution; we have seen how the mass of working people evolved in themselves the fundamental condition for its success: they united their efforts against the exploiters in order to overthrow them. Stages like that of October 1905, February and October 1917 are of world-historic significance.
We have successfully fulfilled the second task of the revolution: to awaken, to raise those very “lower ranks” of society whom the exploiters had pushed down, and who only after October 25, 1917 obtained complete freedom to overthrow the exploiters and to begin to take stock of things and arrange life in their own way. The airing of questions at public meetings by the most oppressed and downtrodden, by the least educated mass of working people, their coming over to the side of the Bolsheviks, their setting up every where of their own Soviet organisations—this was the second great stage of the revolution.
The third stage is now beginning. We must consolidate what we ourselves have won, what we ourselves have decreed, made law, discussed, planned—consolidate all this in stable forms of everyday labour discipline. This is the most difficult, but the most gratifying task, because only its fulfilment will give us a socialist system. We must learn to combine the “public meeting” democracy of the working people—turbulent, surging, overflowing its banks like a spring flood—with iron discipline while at work, with unquestioning obedience to the will of a single person, the Soviet leader, while at work.
We have not yet learned to do this.
We shall learn it.
Yesterday we were mennced by the restoration of bourgeois exploitation, personified by the Kornilovs, Gotzes, Dutovs, Gegechkoris and Bogayevskys. We conquered them. This restoration, this very same restoration menaces us today in another form, in the form of the element of petty-bourgeois laxity and anarchism, or small-proprietor “it’s not my business” psychology, in the form of the daily, petty, but numerous sorties and attacks of this element against proletarian discipline. We must, and we shall, vanquish this element of petty-bourgeois anarchy.
 The Development Of Soviet Organisation The socialist character of Soviet, i.e., proletarian, democracy, as concretely applied today, lies first in the fact that the electors are the working and exploited people; the bourgeoisie is excluded. Secondly, it lies in the fact that all bureaucratic formalities and restrictions of elections are abolished; the people themselves determine the order and time of elections, and are completely free to recall any elected person. Thirdly, it lies in the creation of the best mass organisation of the vanguard of the working people, i.e., the proletariat engaged in large-scale industry, which enables it to lead the vast mass of the exploited, to draw them into independent political life, to educate them politically by their own experience; therefore for the first time a start is made by the entire population in learning the art of administration, and in beginning to administer.
These are the principal distinguishing features of the democracy now applied in Russia, which is a higher type of democracy, a break with the bourgeois distortion of democracy, transition to socialist democracy and to the conditions in which the state can begin to wither away.
It goes without saying that the element of petty-bourgeois disorganisation (which must inevitably be apparent to some extent in every proletarian revolution, and which is especially apparent in our revolution, owing to the petty-bourgeois character of our country, its backwardness and the consequences of a reactionary war) cannot but leave its impress upon the Soviets as well.
We must work unremittingly to develop the organisation of the Soviets and of the Soviet government. There is a petty-bourgeois tendency to transform the members of the Soviets into “parliamentarians”, or else into bureaucrats. We must combat this by drawing all the members of the Soviets into the practical work of administration. In many places the departments of the Soviets are gradually merging with the Commissariats. Our aim is to draw the whole of the poor into the practical work of administration, and all steps that are taken in this direction—the more varied they are, the better—should be carefully recorded, studied, systematised, tested by wider experience and embodied in law. Our aim is to ensure that every toiler, having finished his eight hours’ “task” in productive labour, shall perform state duties without pay; the transition to this is particularly difficult, but this transition alone can guarantee the final consolidation of socialism. Naturally, the novelty and difficulty of the change lead to an abundance of steps being taken, as it were, gropingly, to an abundance of mistakes, vacillation—without this, any marked progress is impossible. The reason why the present position seems peculiar to many of those who would like to be regarded as socialists is that they have been accustomed to contrasting capitalism with socialism abstractly, and that they profoundly put between the two the word “leap” (some of them; recalling fragments of what they have read of Engels’s writings, still more profoundly add the phrase “leap from the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom”[13]. The majority of these so-called socialists, who have “read in books” about socialism but who have never seriously thought over the matter, are unable to consider that by “leap” the teachers of socialism meant turning-points on a world historical scale, and that leaps of this kind extend over decades and even longer periods. Naturally, in such times, the notorious “intelligentsia” provides an infinite number of mourners of the dead. Some mourn over the Constituent Assembly, others mourn over bourgeois discipline, others again mourn over the capitalist system, still others mourn over the cultured landowner, and still others again mourn over imperialist Great Power policy, etc., etc.
The real interest of the epoch of great leaps lies in the fact that the abundance of fragments of the old, which sometimes accumulate more rapidly than the rudiments (not always immediately discernible) of the new, calls for the ability to discern what is most important in the line or chain of development. History knows moments when the most important thing for the success of the revolution is to heap up as large a quantity of the fragments as possible, i.e., to blow up as many of the old institutions as possible; moments arise when enough has been blown up and the next task is to perform the “prosaic” (for the petty-bourgeois revolutionary, the “boring”) task of clearing away the fragments; and moments arise when the careful nursing of the rudiments of the new system, which are growing amidst the wreckage on a soil which as yet has been badly cleared of rubble, is the most important thing.
It is not enough to be a revolutionary and an adherent of socialism or a Communist in general. You must be able at each particular moment to find the particular link in the chain which you must grasp with all your might in order to hold the whole chain and to prepare firmly for the transition to the next link; the order of the links, their form, the manner in which they are linked together, the way they differ from each other in the historical chain of events, are not as simple and not as meaningless as those in an ordinary chain made by a smith.
The fight against the bureaucratic distortion of the Soviet form of organisation is assured by the firmness of the connection between the Soviets and the “people”, meaning by that the working and exploited people, and by the flexibility and elasticity of this connection. Even in the most democratic capitalist republics in the world, the poor never regard the bourgeois parliament as “their” institution. But the Soviets are “theirs” and not alien institutions to the mass of workers and peasants. The modern “Social-Democrats” of the Scheidemann or, what is almost the same thing, of the Martov type are repelled by the Soviets, and they are drawn towards the respectable bourgeois parliament, or to the Constituent Assembly, in the same way as Turgenev, sixty years ago, was drawn towards a moderate monarchist and noblemen’s Constitution and was repelled by the peasant democracy of Dobrolyubov and Chernyshevsky.[14]
It is the closeness of the Soviets to the “people”, to the working people, that creates the special forms of recall and other means of control from below which must be most zealously developed now. For example, the Councils of Public Education, as periodical conferences of Soviet electors and their delegates called to discuss and control the activities of the Soviet authorities in this field, deserve full sympathy and support. Nothing could be sillier than to transform the Soviets into something congealed and self-contained. The more resolutely we now have to stand for a ruthlessly firm government, for the dictatorship of individuals in definite processes of work, in definite aspects of purely executive functions, the more varied must be the forms and methods of control from below in order to counteract every shadow of a possibility of distorting the principles of Soviet government, in order repeatedly and tirelessly to weed out bureaucracy.
 Conclusion An extraordinarily difficult, complex and dangerous situation in international affairs; the necessity of manoeuvring and retreating; a period of waiting for new outbreaks of the revolution which is maturing in the West at a painfully slow pace; within the country a period of slow construction and ruthless “tightening up”, of prolonged and persistent struggle waged by stern, proletarian discipline against the menacing element of petty-bourgeois laxity and anarchy—these in brief are the distinguishing features of the special stage of the socialist revolution in which we are now living. This is the link in the historical chain of events which we must at present grasp with all our might in order to prove equal to the tasks that confront us before passing to the next link to which we are drawn by a special brightness, the brightness of the victories of the international proletarian revolution.
Try to compare with the ordinary everyday concept “revolutionary” the slogans that follow from the specific conditions of the present stage, namely, manoeuvre, retreat, wait, build slowly, ruthlessly tighten up, rigorously discipline, smash laxity. . . . Is it surprising that when certain “revolutionaries” hear this they are seized with noble indignation and begin to “thunder” abuse at us for forgetting the traditions of the October Revolution, for compromising with the bourgeois experts, for compromising with the bourgeoisie, for being petty bourgeois, reformists, and so on and so forth?
The misfortune of these sorry “revolutionaries” is that even those of them who are prompted by the best motives in the world and are absolutely loyal to the cause of socialism fail to understand the particular, and particularly “unpleasant”, condition that a backward country, which has been lacerated by a reactionary and disastrous war and which began the socialist revolution long before the more advanced countries, inevitably has to pass through; they lack stamina in the difficult moments of a difficult transition. Naturally, it is the “Left Socialist-Revolutionaries” who are acting as an “official” opposition of this kind against our Party. Of course, there are and always will be individual exceptions from group and class types. But social types remain. In the land in which the small-proprietor population greatly predominates over the purely proletarian population, the difference between the proletarian revolutionary and petty-bourgeois revolutionary will inevitably make itself felt, and from time to time will make itself felt very sharply. The petty-bourgeois revolutionary wavers and vacillates at every turn of events; he is an ardent revolutionary in March 1917 and praises “coalition” in May, hates the Bolsheviks (or laments over their “adventurism”) in July and apprehensively turns away from them at the end of October, supports them in December, and, finally, in March and April 1918 such types, more often than not, turn up their noses contemptuously and say: “I am not one of those who sing hymns to ’organic’ work, to practicalness and gradualism.”
The social origin of such types is the small proprietor, who has been driven to frenzy by the horrors of war, by sudden ruin, by unprecedented torments of famine and devastation, who hysterically rushes about seeking a way out, seeking salvation, places his confidence in the proletariat and supports it one moment and the next gives way to fits of despair. We must clearly understand and firmly remember the fact that socialism cannot be built on such a social basis. The only class that can lead the working and exploited people is the class that unswervingly follows its path without losing courage and without giving way to despair even at the most difficult, arduous and dangerous stages. Hysterical impulses are of no use to us. What we need is the steady advance of the iron battalions of the proletariat.
 
Endnotes
[1] In the manuscript, Lenin’s work The Immediate rasks of the Soviet Gouernment was headed “Theses on the Tasks of the Soviet Government in the Present Situation”. Lenin’s theses were discussed at a meeting of the Party Central Committee on April 26, 1918.
The Central Committee unanimously approved them and passed a decision to have them published as an article in Pravda and Izvestia, and also as a separate pamphlet. In 1918 the pamphlet went through more than ten editions, in Moscow, Petrograd, Saratov, Kazan, Tambov and other cities of Russia. It was published in the same year in English in New York, and in French in Geneva; an abridged version in German, edited by F. Platten, appeared in Zurich under the title Am Tage nach der Revolution.
The Central Committee instructed Lenin to give a report on the immediate tasks of the Soviet government at a meeting of the All-Russia C.E.C. and to formulate the Theses briefly as a resolution (see this volume, pp. 314-17).
[2] Bogayevsky, M. P. (1881-1918)—counter-revolutionary leader and organiser of the civil war against Soviet power on the Don. He was defeated and surrendered in the spring of 1918.
[3] On November 18 (December 1), 1917 the Council of People’s Commissars, acting on a proposal made by Lenin, passed a decision “On the Remuneration of People’s Commissars and Senior Government Employees and Officials” (published on November 23 [December 6], 1917 in No. 16 of the Newspaper of the Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government ). Drafted by Lenin it fixed the maximum monthly salary of a People’s Commissar at 500 rubles with an additional 100 rubles for every member of his family unable to work. This corresponded roughly to the worker’s average monthly wage. On January 2 (15),1918, in answer to an inquiry from the People’s Commissar for Labour A. G Shlyapnikov, the Council of People’s Commissars issued a decision written by Lenin explaining that the Decree of November 18 (December 1), 1917 fixed no limit for the payment of experts and thus sanctioned higher remuneration for scientific and technical experts.
[4] Control over foreign trade was initiated in the early days of Soviet power. At first this was handled by the Petrograd Revolutionary Military Committee, which considered applications for the import and export of goods and supervised the work of the customs. By a decree of the Council of People’s Commissars of December 29 1917 (January 11, 1918) foreign trade was placed under the control of the People’s Commissariat for Trade and Industry. This kind of control and customs inspection, however, was not enough to protect the Soviet economy from foreign capital. Lenin emphasised later that the working class of Soviet Russia “would be totally unable to build up its own industry and make Russia an industrial country without the protection, not of tariffs, but of the monopoly of foreign trade” (see V. I. Lenin, On the Foreign Policy of the Soviet State, Moscow, p. 424). In December 1917 Lenin proposed introducing a state monopoly on foreign trade, a decree on which was passed by the Council of People’s Commissars on April 22, 1918 (see Decrees of the Soviet Government, Russ. ed., Vol. 2, 1959, pp. 158-60).
[5] In the first months of Soviet power indemnities and special taxes were one of the principal sources of revenue, particularly in the provinces. When Soviet power became more firmly establisiled the question arose of how to devise a regular system of taxation based primarily on a progressive income tax and a property tax which would make it possible to place the main burden of taxation on the well-to-do sections of the population. At the First All-Russia Congress of Representatives of the Financial Departments of the Soviets, Lenin pointed out: “We have many plans in this sphere and have cleared the ground on which to build the foundation, but the actual foundation of that building has not yet been built. The time for this has now come” (see this volume, pp. 384-85). The Congress accepted Lenin’s proposal on the need to introduce an income tax and property tax and elected a special commission to draw up the requisite Statute on the basis of Lenin’s theses.
On June 17,1918 the Council of People’s Commissars approved the Decree on the Amendment of the Decree of November 24, 1917 on the Levying of Direct Taxes, which laid down a strict system of income and property taxation (see Decrees of the Soviet Government, Russ. ed., Vol. 2, 1959, pp. 441-43).
[6] Decree on Consumers’ Co-operative Societies was passed by the Council of People’s Commissars on April 10, 1918, approved at a meeting of the All-Russia C.E.C. on April 11, and published over Lenin’s signature in Pravda No. 71 of April 13 and Izvestia VTsIK No. 75 of April 16.
The first draft of the decree, written by Lenin, was worked out in detail by the People’s Commissariat for Food and published on January 19 (February 1) in Izvestia TsIK No. 14. The draft decree was bitterly opposed by bourgeois co-operators, who insisted that co-operative societies should be independent of the organs of Soviet power. In order to use the existillg co-operative apparatus for accounting and control of the distribntion of foodstuffs the Council of People’s Commissars made several concessions during its negotiations with bourgeois co-operators (March to the beginning of April 1918). On April 9 and 10 the C.P.C. discussed the draft decree proposed by the co-operators. Lenin revised the draft considerably (he rewrote points 11, 12 and 13), and the decree with his amendments was passed by the Council of People’s Commissars, and then by the All-Russia C.E.C.
[7] The organisation of social production on socialist principles made it necessary to draw up new internal regulations for the nationalised enterprises, and new regulations on labour discipline and on enrolling all able-bodied persons for socially useful work. These questions acquired special importance in the period of the peaceful breathing-space in the spring of 1918.
The first regulations concerning labour discipline were worked out by the Soviet trade unions in conjunction with managerial bodies. They were discussed at a number of meetings of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council with representatives of the central organs of the trade unions taking part. On March 27 the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council after a debate in which Lenin participated passed a decision charging the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions with the task of drawing up a general statute on labour discipline. On April 1, with Lenin taking part, the Presidium examined the draft resolution on labour discipline drawn up by the A.C.C.T.U. and proposed that it should be re-worded as a decree, taking into account Lenin’s remarks and suggestions. The re-worded Statute on Labour Discipline passed by the A.C.C.T.U. on April 3 was published in the magazine Narodnoye Khozyaistvo No. 2, for April 1918. In this statute the A.C.C.T.U. stated that strict regulations regarding internal management should be introduced at all state-owned enterprises, that output quotas and account of labour productivity should be established, that piece-work and a system of bonuses for exceeding output quotas should be introduced, and that stern action should be taken against those who violated labour discipline. On the basis of the Statute speciflc internal regulations were drawn up at factories and these played an important part in the organisation of socialist industry. The Central Committee of the Metalworkers’ Union was one of the first to carry out Lenin’s instructions on raising labour productivity by introducing a system of piece-work and bonuses. When the question of improving labour discipline was discussed by the A.C.C.T.U. representatives of the Central Committee of the Metalworkers’ Union got the thesis on the need for piece rates included in the resolution submitted on April 1 for consideration by the Presidium of the Supremc Economic Council. In April, on the basis of the decisions taken by the A.C.C.T.U. the Central Committee of the Metalworkers’ Union instructed all the lower organisations of the union to adopt piece-work and the bonus system in the metal industry.
[8] After the October Revolution piece-work was almost everywhere superseded by a time system of payment, which had an adverse effect on labour productivity and labour discipline.
The introduction of piece-work, which came closest to the socialist principle of “to each according to his work”, began at the first nationalised enterprises. During the period of respite, piece work was widely adopted in industry. By July 1918, for instance, a quarter of the workers of Petrograd went over to piece-work. The principle of payment according to the piece was finally endorsed by the pubucation in December 1918 of the Soviet Labour Code.
[9] This refers to the right protected by bourgeois law to keep secret all production, trade and financial operations and also all the relevant documents at private capitalist enterprises.
In his work The Impending Catastrophe and How to Combat It Lenin showed that commercial secrecy in the hands of the bourgeoisie was “an instrument for concealing financial swindles and the fantastically high profits of big capital” (see present edition, Vol. 25, p. 339), and showed why commercial secrecy should be abolished. The resolution of the Sixth Congress of the R.S.D.L.P.(B.) “On the Economic Situation” demanded the abolition of commercial secrecy as an essential measure for making workers’ control effective (see The C.P.S.U. in the Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses, Conferences and Plenums of the Central Committee, Part 1, Russ. ed., 1954, p. 378). After the October Revolution commercial secrecy was abolished by the Statute on Workers’ Control passed by the All-Russia C.E.C. and the Council of People’s Commissars on November 14 (27), 1917.
[10] The reference is to the decree of the Council of People’s Commissars “On Centralisation of Management, Protection of Roads and the Improvement of Their Carrying Capacity” (see Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol. 2 Russ. ed., 1959, pp. 18-20). Having considered on March 18, 1918 the draft decree proposed by the People’s Commissariat for Ways of Communication on non-interference by various institutions in the affairs of the Railway Department, the Council of People’s Commissars instructed a special commission to revise the decree on the basis of the following theses put forward by Lenin: (1) Considerable centralisation. (2) Appointment of responsible executives at every local centre as elected by the railway organisations. (3) Unquestioning obedience to their orders. (4) Dictatorial rights to be given to the military detachments for maintaining order. (5) Steps to be taken immediately to take account of rolling stock and its whereabouts. (6) Steps to be taken to set up a technical department. (7) Fuel.
Lenin made several important amendments to the draft, which was submitted by the commission and considered at a meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars on March 21, before being approved by the government. In view of the hostilily with which the decree was greeted by the All-Russia Executive Committee of Railwaymen (Vikzhedor), which was strongly influenced by the Mensheviks and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, the People’s Commissariat for Ways of Communication on March 23 proposed amending the decree at a meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars. The representatives of Vikzhedor who attended the meeting attacked the decree on the grounds that it meant the “destruction of the role of Vikzhedor and its replacement by the individual authority of a Commissar”. Arguing against the opponents of the decree, Lenin explained the need for taking the very firmest measures to eliminate sabotage and inefficiency on the railways and introduced amendments making the decree even more categorical. With these amendments the decree was finally approved by the government on March 23 and published over Lenin’s signature on March 26 in No. 57 of Izvestia VTsIK.
[11] Vperyod (Forward )—a Menshevik daily newspaper, which began to appear in March 1917 in Moscow as the organ of the Moscow organisation of Mensheviks, and subsequently as the organ of the committees of the R.S.D.L.P. (Mensheviks) of the Moscow organisation and the Central Region On April 2, 1918 the newspaper became the organ of the Mensheviks’ Central Committee as well, and L. Martov, F. I. Dan and A. S. Martynov joined its editorial board, It was banned for its counter-revolutionary activities in February 1919 by decision of the All-Russia C.E.C.
[12] Nash Vek (Our Age )—one of the names of the newspaper Rech, the central organ of the counter-revolutionary party of the Constitutional-Democrats. After it had been banned by a decision of the Petrograd Revolutionary Military Committee of October 26 (November 8), 1917, the newspaper continued to appear until August 1918 under various names: Nasha Rech (Our Speech ), Svobodnaya Rech (Free Speech ), Vek (Age ), Novaya Rech (New Speech ) and Nash Vek.
[13] Lenin is referring to and quoting from Anti-Dühring by F. Engels, Section Three. Socialism. Chapter II. Theoretical.
[14] Chernyshevsky describes Turgenev’s attitude to Dobrolyubov and himself in an account of a conversation he had with Turgenev in the early sixties of the last century (see the article “An Expression of Gratitude” in Complete Collected Works by N. G. Chernyshevsky, Vol. 10, Russ. ed., Moscow, 1951, pp. 122-23).

The Supreme Economic Council should immediately give its instructions to the
    Academy of Sciences, which has launched a systematic study and investigation of the natural
    productive forces[2] of
    Russia, to set up a number of expert commissions for the speediest possible compilation of a
    plan for the reorganisation of industry and the economic progress of Russia. The plan should
    include: the rational distribution of industry in Russia from the standpoint of proximity to
    raw materials and the lowest consumption of labour-power in the transition from the
    processing of the raw materials to all subsequent stages in the processing of
    semi-manufactured goods, up to and including the output of the finished product; the rational
    merging and concentration of industry in a few big enterprises from the standpoint of the
    most up-todate large-scale industry, especially trusts; enabling the present Russian Soviet
    Republic (excluding the Ukraine and the regions occupied by the Germans) as far as possible
    to provide itself independently with all the chief items of raw materials and organise main
    branches of industry; special attention to the electrification of industry and transport and
    the application of electricity to farming, and the use of lower grades of fuel (peat,
    low-grade coal) for the production of electricity, with the lowest possible expenditure on
    extraction and transport; water power and wind motors in general and in their application to
    farming.

[1] The Draft Plan of Scientific
    and Technical Work marked an important stage in the process of mobilising Russia's scientific
    personnel to deal with the problems of the national economy.
Negotiations with the Academy of Sciences were initiated by Lenin and the
    Soviet Government in January 1918. Lenin directed the work of the People's Commissariat for
    Education, which was conducting the negotiations. At the end of March the Academy of Sciences
    in a declaration to the Soviet Government consented to the government's proposal that the
    Academy should work in the field of exploring the country's natural resources. On April 12,
    at a meeting of the Council of People's Commissars with Lenin in the chair a resolution was
    passed that set the Academy of Sciences "the urgent task of systematically solving the
    problems of the correct distribution of the country's industry and the most rational
    utilisation of economic resources". A decision was also taken recognising the need to finance
    the work of the Academy in this field. With considerable financial backing from the
    government the Academy's Commission for the Study of Russia's Natural Productive Forces
    enlarged the scope of its activities.
In the Draft Plan of Scientific and Technical Work Lenin outlined a broad
    programme for the work of the Academy of Sciences and all the country's scientific and
    technical personnel. Lenin's pointers were later amplified in a number of documents drawn up
    by the Supreme Economic Council (SEC). One of these was the model programme of work of the
    expert commissions of the Academy of Sciences compiled on April 25 by the Supreme Economic
    Council Department for the Organisation of Production. Guided by Lenin's instructions, the
    Soviet economic departments in the capital and the provinces, the Academy of Sciences and
    various research institutes and societies studied the country's natural wealth, power
    resources and various problems connected with the electrification of the national economy.
    Committees and bureaus for the electrification of the basic industrial areas were set u in
    Petrograd and Moscow in the first months of Soviet rule. In Me autumn of 1918, the Central
    Electrotechnical Council was formed on a mandate from Lenin, which set out its main task as
    "producing the best and most rapid solution of the technical and estimating problems in the
    field of the new power developments". Electrification on a large scale for those days was
    launched in 1918.
[2] Publication of this material
    must be accelerated to the utmost; a note about this must be sent to the Commissariat for
    Education, the Printing Workers’ Trade Union and the Commissariat for Labour.[3]
[3]Lenin is referring to the
    materials provied by the Commission for the Stud of Russia’s Natural Prdouctive Forces, set
    up by the Academy of Sciences in 1915. On Lenin’s instuctin the commission was given much
    wider scope for publishing its findings. A series of books called Ã¢ÂÂRussa’s RichesÃ¢ÂÂ and the
    multi-volume The Natural roductive forces of Russia began to appear. In the frist
    three years of Soviet power (1918-1920) the commission published four times as man books as
    in the previous three years preceeding the revolution.

## Six Theses On The Immediate Tasks Of The Soviet Government











Six Theses on the Immediate Tasks



V. I. Lenin
Six Theses On The
    Immediate Tasks Of The Soviet Government[1]

Written:Between April 30 and May 3,
    1918
First Published: 1918 in the pamphlet: N. Lenin The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government, All-Russia C.E.C. Publishers; Published according to the text of the second edition of the pamphlet, 1918, collated with the manuscript

1. The international position of the Soviet Republic is extremely difficult
    and critical, because the deepest and fundamental interests of international capital and
    imperialism induce it to strive not only for a military onslaught on Russia, but also for an
    agreement on the partition of Russia and the strangulation of the Soviet power.
Only the intensification of the imperialist slaughter of the peoples in Western Europe and
    the imperialist rivalry between Japan and America in the Far East paralyse, or restrain,
    these aspirations, and then only partially, and only for a certain, probably short, time.
Therefore, the tactics of the Soviet Republic must be, on the one hand, to exert every
    effort to ensure the country’s speediest economic recovery, to increase its defence
    capacity, to build up a powerful socialist army; on the other hand, in international policy,
    the tactics must be those of manoeuvring, retreat, waiting for the moment when the
    international proletarian revolution—which is now maturing more quickly than before in
    a number of advanced countries—fully matures.
2. In the sphere of domestic policy, the task that comes to the forefront at the present
    time in conformity with tho resolution adopted by the All-Russia Congress of Soviets on March
    15, 1918, is the task of organisation. It is this task, in connection with the new and higher
    organisation of production and distribution on the basis of socialised large-scale machine
    (labour) production, that constitutes the chief content—and chief condition of complete
    victory —of the socialist revolution that was begun in Russia on October 25, 1917.
3. From the purely political point of view, the essence of the present situation is that
    the task of convincing the working people of Russia that the programme of the socialist
    revolution is correct and the task of winning Russia from the exploiters for the working
    people have, in main and fundamental outline, been carried out, and the chief problem that
    comes to the forefront now is—how to administer Russia. The organisation of proper
    administration, the undeviating fulfilment of the decisions of the Soviet
    government—this is the urgent task of the Soviets, this is the condition for the
    complete victory of the Soviet type of state, which it is not enough to proclaim in formal
    decrees, which it is not enough to establish and introduce in all parts of the country, but
    which must also be practically organised and tested in the course of the regular, everyday
    work of administration.
4. In the sphere of the economic building of socialism, the essence of the present
    situation is that our work of organising the country-wide and all-embracing accounting and
    control of production and distribution, and of introducing proletarian control of production,
    lags far behind the direct expropriation of the expropriators—the land owners and
    capitalists. This is the fundamental fact deter mining our tasks.
From this it follows, on the one hand, that the struggle against the bourgeoisie is
    entering a new phase, namely: the centre of gravity is shifting to the organisation of
    accounting and control. Only in this way is it possible to consolidate all the economic
    achievements directed against capital, all the measures in nationalising individual branches
    of the national economy that we have carried out since October; and only in this way is it
    possible to prepare for the successful consummation of the struggle against the bourgeoisie,
    i.e., the complete consolidation of socialism.
From this basic fact follows, on the other hand, the explanation as to why the Soviet
    government was obliged in certain cases to take a step backward, or to agree to compromise
    with bourgeois tendencies. Such a step backward and departure from the principles of the
    Paris Commune was,
for example, the introduction of high salaries for a number of bourgeois experts. Such a
    compromise was the agreement with the bourgeois co-operatives concerning steps and measures
    for gradually bringing the entire population into the co-operatives. Compromises of this kind
    will be necessary until the proletarian government has put country-wide control and
    accounting firmly on its feet; and our task is, while not in the least concealing their
    unfavourable features from the people, to exert efforts to improve accounting and control as
    the only means and method of completely eliminating all compromises of this kind. Compromises
    of this kind are needed at the present time as the sole (because we are late with accounting
    and control) guarantee of slower, but surer progress. When the accounting and control of
    production and distribution is fully introduced the need for such compromises will
    disappear.
5. Particular significance now attaches to measures for raising labour discipline and the
    productivity of labour. Every effort must be exerted for the steps already undertaken in this
    direction, especially by the trade unions, to be sustained, consolidated and increased. This
    includes, for example, the introduction of piece-work, the adoption of much that is
    scientific and progressive in the Taylor system, the payment of wages commensurate with the
    general results of the work of a factory, the exploitation of rail and water transport, etc.
    This also includes the organisation of competition between individual producers’ and
    consumers’ communes, selection of organisers, etc.
6. The proletarian dictatorship is absolutely indispensable during the transition from
    capitalism to socialism, and in our revolution this truth has been fully confirmed in
    practice. Dictatorship, however, presupposes a revolutionary government that is really firm
    and ruthless in crushing both exploiters and hooligans, and our government is too mild.
    Obedience, and unquestioning obedience at that, during work to the one-man decisions of
    Soviet directors, of the dictators elected or appointed by Soviet institutions, vested with
    dictatorial powers (as is demanded, for example, by the railway decree), is far, very far
    from being guaranteed as yet. This is the effect of the influence of petty-bourgeois anarchy,
    the anarchy of small-proprietor habits, aspirations and sentiments, which fundamentally
    contradict proletarian discipline and socialism. The proletariat must concentrate all its
    class-consciousness on the task of combating this petty-bourgeois anarchy, which is not only
    directly apparent (in the support given by the bourgeoisie and their hangers-on, the
    Mensheviks, Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, etc., to every kind of resistance to the
    proletarian government), but also indirectly apparent (in the historical vacillation
    displayed on the major questions of policy by both the petty-bourgeois Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries and the trend in our Party called “Left Communist”,
    which descends to the methods of petty-bourgeois revolutionariness and copies the Left
    Socialist-Revolutionaries).
Iron discipline and the thorough exercise of proletarian dictatorship against
    petty-bourgeois vacillation—this is the general and summarising slogan of the
    moment.

 The publication by a small group of “Left Communists”
of their journal, Kommunist (No. 1, April 20, 1918), and of
their “theses”, strikingly confirms my views expressed in the pamphlet The Immediate
Tasks of the Soviet Government. There could not be better
confirmation, in political literature, of the utter naïvete of the
defence of petty-bourgeois sloppiness that is sometimes concealed by

“Left” slogans. It is useful and necessary to deal with the arguments
of “Left Communists” because they are characteristic of the period we
are passing through. They show up with exceptional clarity the negative
side of the “core” of this period. They are instructive, because the
people we are dealing with are the best of those who have failed to
understand the present period, people who by their knowledge and
loyalty stand far, far above the ordinary representatives of
the same mistaken views, namely, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. 
 I 
 As a political magnitude, or as a group claiming to play a
political role, the “Left Communist” group has presented its “Theses on
the Present Situation”. It is a good Marxist custom to give a coherent
and complete exposition of the principles underlying one’s views and
tactics. And this good Marxist custom has helped to reveal the mistake
committed by our “Lefts”, because the mere attempt to argue and not to
declaim exposes the unsoundness of their argument. 
 The first thing that strikes one is the abundance of allusions,
hints and evasions with regard to the old question of whether it was
right to conclude the Brest Treaty. The “Lefts” dare not put the
question in a straightforward manner. They flounder about in a comical
fashion, pile argument on argument, fish for reasons, plead that “on
the one hand” it may be so, but “on the other hand” it may not, their
thoughts wander over all and sundry subjects, they try all the time not
to see that they are defeating themselves. The “Lefts” are very careful
to quote the figures: twelve votes at the Party Congress against peace,
twenty-eight votes in favour, but they discreetly refrain from
mentioning that of the hundreds of votes cast at the meeting of the
Bolshevik group of the Congress of Soviets they obtained less than
one-tenth. They have invented a “theory” that the peace was carried by

“the exhausted and declassed elements”, while it was opposed by “the
workers and peasants of the southern regions, where there was greater
vitality in economic life and the supply of bread was more assured”. .
. . Can one do anything but laugh at this? There is not a word about
the voting at the All-Ukraine Congress of Soviets in favour of peace,
nor about the social and class character of the typically
petty-bourgeois and declassed political conglomeration in Russia who
were opposed to peace (the Left Socialist-Revolutionary party). In an
utterly childish manner, by means of amusing “scientific” explanations,
they try to conceal their own bankruptcy, to conceal the facts, the
mere review of which would show that it was precisely the declassed,
intellectual “cream” of the party, the elite, who opposed the peace
with slogans couched in revolutionary petty-bourgeois phrases, that it
was precisely the mass of workers and exploited peasants who
carried the peace. 
 Nevertheless, in spite of all the above-mentioned declarations and
evasions of the “Lefts” on the question of war and peace, the plain and
obvious truth manages to come to light. The authors of the theses are
compelled to admit that “the conclusion of peace has for the time being
weakened the imperialists’ attempts to make a deal on a world scale”

(this is inaccurately formulated by the “Lefts”, but this is not the
place to deal with inaccuracies). “The conclusion of peace has already
caused the conflict between the imperialist powers to become more
acute.” 
 Now this is a fact. Here is something that has decisive
significance. That is why those who opposed the conclusion of peace
were unwittingly playthings in the hands of the imperialists and fell
into the trap laid for them by the imperialists. For, until the world
socialist revolution breaks out, until it embraces several countries
and is strong enough to overcome international imperialism,
it is the direct duty of the socialists who have conquered in one
country (especially a backward one) not to accept battle against the
giants of imperialism. Their duty is to try to avoid battle, to wait
until the conflicts between the imperialists weaken them even more,
and bring the revolution in other countries even nearer. Our “Lefts”

did not understand this simple truth in January, February and March.
Even now they are afraid of admitting it openly. But it comes to light
through all their confused reasoning like “on the one hand it must be
confessed, on the other hand one must admit”. 
 “During the coming spring and summer,” the “Lefts” write in their
theses, “the collapse of the imperialist system must begin. In the
event of a victory for German imperialism in the present phase of the
war this collapse can only be postponed, but it will then express
itself in even more acute forms.” 
 This formulation is even more childishly inaccurate despite its
playing at science. It is natural for children to “understand” science
to mean something that can determine in what year, spring, summer,
autumn or winter the “collapse must begin”. 
 These are ridiculous, vain attempts to ascertain what cannot be
ascertained. No serious politician will ever say when this or
that collapse of a “system” “must begin” (the more so that the collapse
of the system has already begun, and it is now a question of
the moment when the outbreak of revolution in particular
countries will begin). But an indisputable truth forces its way through
this childishly helpless formulation, namely, the outbreaks of
revolution in other, more advanced, countries are nearer now,
a month since the beginning of the “respite” which followed the
conclusion of peace, than they were a month or six weeks ago. 
 What follows? 
 It follows that the peace supporters were absolutely right, and
their stand has been justified by the course of events. They were right
in having drummed into the minds of the lovers of ostentation that one
must be able to calculate the balance of forces and not help
the imperialists by making the battle against socialism easier for them
when socialism is still weak, and when the chances of the battle are
manifestly against socialism. 
 Our “Left” Communists, however, who are also fond of calling
themselves “proletarian” Communists, because there is very little that
is proletarian about them and very much that is petty-bourgeois, are
incapable of giving thought to the balance of forces, to calculating
it. This is the core of Marxism and Marxist tactics, but they
disdainfully brush aside the “core” with “proud” phrases such as: 
 “. . . That the masses have become firmly imbued with an inactive *&8216;peace mentality’
is an objective fact of the political situation. . . .” 
 What a gem! After three years of the most agonising and reactionary
war, the people, thanks to Soviet power and its correct tactics, which
never lapsed into mere phrase-making, have obtained a very, very brief,
insecure and far from sufficient respite. The “Left” intellectual
striplings, however, with the magnificence of a self-infatuated
Narcissus, profoundly declare “that the masses [???] have become firmly
imbued [!!!] with an inactive [!!!???] peace mentality”. Was I not
right when I said at the Party Congress that the paper or journal of
the “Lefts” ought to have been called not Kommunist but Szlachcic. [Szlachcic—a Polish nobleman —Ed.] 
 Can a Communist with the slightest understanding of the mentality
and the conditions of life of the toiling and exploited people descend
to the point of view of the typical declassed petty-bourgeois
intellectual with the mental outlook of a noble or szlachcic,
which declares that a “peace mentality” is “inactive” and believes that
the brandishing of a cardboard sword is “activity"? For our “Lefts”
merely brandish a cardboard sword when they ignore the universally
known fact, of which the war in the Ukraine has served as an additional
proof, that peoples utterly exhausted by three years of butchery cannot
go on fighting without a respite; and that war, if it cannot be
organised on a national scale, very often creates a mentality of
disintegration peculiar to petty proprietors, instead of the iron
discipline of the proletariat. Every page of Kommunist shows
that our “Lefts” have no idea of iron proletarian discipline and how it
is achieved, that they are thoroughly imbued with the mentality of the
declassed petty-bourgeois intellectual. 
 II 
 Perhaps all these phrases of the “Lefts” about war can be put down
to mere childish exuberance, which, moreover, concerns the past, and
therefore has not a shadow of political significance? This is the
argument some people put up in defence of our “Lefts”. But this is
wrong. Anyone aspiring to political leadership must be able to think
out political problems, and lack of this ability converts the “Lefts”
into spineless preachers of a policy of vacillation, which objectively
can have only one result, namely, by their vacillation the “Lefts” are
helping the imperialists to provoke the Russian Soviet Republic
into a battle that will obviously be to its disadvantage, they are
helping the imperialists to draw us into a snare. Listen to this: 
 “. . . The Russian workers’ revolution cannot *&8216;save itself’ by
abandoning the path of world revolution, by continually avoiding battle
and yielding to the pressure of international capital, by making
concessions to ’home capital’. 
 “From this point of view it is necessary to adopt a determined
class international policy which will unite international revolutionary
propaganda by word and deed, and to strengthen the organic connection
with international socialism (and not with the international
bourgeoisie). . . .” 
 I shall deal separately with the thrusts at home policy contained
in this passage. But examine this riot of phrase-making—and timidity in
deeds—in the sphere of foreign policy. What tactics are binding

at the present time on all who do not wish to be tools of
imperialist provocation, and who do not wish to walk into the snare?
Every politician must give a clear, straightforward reply to this
question. Our Party’s reply is well known. At the present
moment we must retreat and avoid battle. Our “Lefts” dare not
contradict this and shoot into the air: “A determined class
international policy"!! 
 This is deceiving the people. If you want to fight now, say so
openly. If you don’t wish to retreat now, say so openly.
Otherwise, in your objective role, you are a tool of imperialist
provocation. And your subjective “mentality” is that of a frenzied
petty bourgeois who swaggers and blusters but senses perfectly well
that the proletarian is right in retreating and in trying to
retreat in an organised way. He senses that the proletarian is right in
arguing that because we lack strength we must retreat (before Western
and Eastern imperialism) even as far as the Urals, for in this lies the

only chance of playing for time while the revolution in the
West matures, the revolution which is not “bound” (despite the twaddle
of the “Lefts") to begin in “spring or summer”, but which is coming
nearer and becoming more probable every month. 
 The “Lefts” have no policy of their “own”. They dare not

declare that retreat at the present moment is unnecessary. They twist
and turn, play with words, substitute the question of “continuously”
avoiding battle for the question of avoiding battle at the present
moment. They blow soap bubbles such as “international
revolutionary propaganda by deed"!! What does this mean? 
 It can only mean one of two things: either it is mere Nozdryovism,[1] or it
means an offensive war to overthrow international imperialism. Such
nonsense cannot be uttered openly, and that is why the “Left”
Communists are obliged to take refuge from the derision of every
politically conscious proletarian behind high-sounding and empty
phrases. They hope the inattentive reader will not notice the real
meaning of the phrase “international revolutionary propaganda by deed”.


 The flaunting of high-sounding phrases is characteristic of the
declassed petty-bourgeois intellectuals. The organised proletarian
Communists will certainly punish this “habit” with nothing less than
derision and expulsion from all responsible posts. The people must be
told the bitter truth simply, clearly and in a straightforward manner:
it is possible, and even probable, that the war party will again get
the upper hand in Germany (that is, an offensive against us will
commence at once), and that Germany together with Japan, by official
agreement or by tacit understanding, will partition and strangle us.
Our tactics, if we do not want to listen to the ranters, must be to
wait, procrastinate, avoid battle and retreat. If we shake off the
ranters and “brace ourselves” by creating genuinely iron, genuinely
proletarian, genuinely communist discipline, we shall have a good
chance of gaining many months. And then by retreating even, if the
worst comes to the worst, to the Urals, we shall make it easier
for our ally (the international proletariat) to come to our aid, to
“catch up” (to use the language of sport) the distance between the
beginning of revolutionary outbreaks and revolution. 
 These, and these alone, are the tactics which can in fact
strengthen the connection between one temporarily isolated section of
international socialism and the other sections. But to tell the truth,
all that your arguments lead to, dear “Left Communists”, is the

“strengthening of the organic connection” between one high-sounding
phrase and another. A bad sort of “organic
connection”, this! 
 I shall enlighten you, my amiable friends, as to why such disaster
overtook you. It is because you devote more effort to learning by heart
and committing to memory revolutionary slogans than to thinking them
out. This leads you to write “the defence of the socialist fatherland”
in quotation marks, which are probably meant to signify your attempts
at being ironical, but which really prove that you are muddleheads. You
are accustomed to regard “defencism” as something base and despicable;
you have learned this and committed it to memory. You have learned this
by heart so thoroughly that some of you have begun talking nonsense to
the effect that defence of the fatherland in an imperialist epoch

is impermissible
(as a matter of fact, it is impermissible only in an imperialist,
reactionary war, waged by the bourgeoisie). But you have not thought
out why and when “defencism” is abominable. 
 To recognise defence of the fatherland means recognising the
legitimacy and justice of war. Legitimacy and justice from what point
of view? Only from the point of view of the socialist, proletariat and
its struggle for its emancipation. We do not recognise any other point
of view. If war is waged by the exploiting class with the object of
strengthening its rule as a class, such a war is a criminal
war, and “defencism” in such a war is a base betrayal of socialism. If
war is waged by the proletariat after it has conquered the bourgeoisie
in its own country, and is waged with the object of strengthening and
developing socialism, such a war is legitimate and “holy”. 
 We have been “defencists” since October 20, 1917. I have
said this more than once very definitely, and you dare not deny this.
It is precisely in the interests of “strengthening the connection” with
international socialism that we are in duty bound to defend
our socialist fatherland. Those who treat frivolously the
defence of the country in which the proletariat has already achieved
victory are the ones who destroy the connection with international
socialism. When we were the representatives of an oppressed class we
did not adopt a frivolous attitude towards defence of the fatherland in
an imperialist war. We opposed such defence on principle. Now that we
have become representatives of the ruling class, which has begun to
organise socialism, we demand that everybody adopt a serious

attitude towards defence of the country. And adopting a serious
attitude towards defence of the country means thoroughly preparing for
it, and strictly calculating the balance of forces. If our forces are
obviously small, the best means of defense is retreat into the
interior of the country (anyone who regards this as an artificial
formula, made up to suit the needs of the moment, should read old
Clausewitz, one of the greatest authorities on military matters,
concerning the lessons of history to be learned in this connection).
The “Left Communists”, however, do not give the slightest indication
that they understand the significance of the question of the balance of
forces. 
 When we were opposed to defencism on principle we were justified in
holding up to ridicule those who wanted to “save” their fatherland,
ostensibly in the interests of socialism. When we gained the right to
be proletarian defencists the whole question was radically altered. It
has become our duty to calculate with the utmost accuracy the different
forces involved, to weigh with the utmost care the chances of our ally
(the international proletariat) being able to come to our aid in time.
It is in the interest of capital to destroy its enemy (the
revolutionary proletariat) bit by bit, before the workers in all
countries have united (actually united, i.e., by beginning the
revolution). It is in our interest to do all that is possible, to take
advantage of the slightest opportunity to postpone the decisive battle
until the moment (or until after the moment) the
revolutionary workers’ contingents have united in a single great
international army. 
III 
 We shall pass on to the misfortunes of our “Left” Communists in the
sphere of home policy. It is difficult to read the following phrases in
the theses on the present situation without smiling. 
 “. . . The systematic use of the remaining means of production is
conceivable only if a most determined policy of socialisation is
pursued” . . . “not to capitulate to the bourgeoisie and its
petty-bourgeois intellectualist servitors, but to rout the bourgeoisie
and to put down sabotage completely. . . .” 
 Dear “Left Communists”, how determined they are, but how little
thinking they display. What do they mean by pursuing “a most determined
policy of socialisation"? 
 One may or may not be determined on the question of nationalisation
or confiscation, but the whole point is that even the greatest possible
“determination” in the world is not enough to pass from
nationalisation and confiscation to socialisation. The
misfortune of our “Lefts” is that by their naïve, childish
combination of the words “most determined policy of socialisation” they
reveal their utter failure to understand the crux of the question, the
crux of the “present” situation. The misfortune of our “Lefts” is that
they have missed the very essence of the “present situation”, the
transition from confiscation (the carrying out of which requires above
all determination in a politician) to socialisation (the carrying out
of which requires a different quality in the revolutionary). 
 Yesterday, the main task of the moment was, as determinedly as
possible, to nationalise, confiscate, beat down and crush the
bourgeoisie, and put down sabotage. Today, only a blind man could fail
to see that we have nationalised, confiscated, beaten down and put down
more than we have had time to count. The difference between
socialisation and simple confiscation is that confiscation can be
carried out by “determination” alone, without the ability to calculate
and distribute properly, whereas socialisation cannot be brought
about without this ability. 
 The historical service we have rendered is that yesterday we were
determined (and we shall be tomorrow) in confiscating, in beating down
the bourgeoisie, in putting down sabotage. To write about this today in
“theses on the present situation” is to fix one’s eyes on the past and
to fail to understand the transition to the future. 
 “. . . To put down sabotage completely. . . .” What a task they
have found! Our saboteurs are quite sufficiently “put down”. What we
lack is something quite different. We lack the proper calculation
of which saboteurs to set to work and where to place them. We lack the
organisation of our own forces that is needed for, say, one Bolshevik
leader or controller to be able to supervise a hundred saboteurs who
are now coming into our service. When that is how matters stand, to
flaunt such phrases as “a most determined policy of socialisation”,
“routing”, and “completely putting down” is just missing the mark. It
is typical of the petty-bourgeois revolutionary not to notice that
routing, putting down, etc., is not enough for socialism. It is
sufficient for a small proprietor enraged against a big proprietor. But
no proletarian revolutionary would ever fall into such error. 
 If the words we have quoted provoke a smile, the following
discovery made by the “Left Communists” will provoke nothing short of
Homeric laughter. According to them, under the “Bolshevik deviation to
the right” the Soviet Republic is threatened with “evolution towards
state capitalism”. They have really frightened us this time! And with
what gusto these “Left Communists” repeat this threatening revelation
in their theses and articles. . . . 
 It has not occurred to them that state capitalism would be a step
forward as compared with the present state of affairs in our
Soviet Republic. If in approximately six months’ time state capitalism
became established in our Republic, this would be a great success and a
sure guarantee that within a year socialism will have gained a
permanently firm hold and will have become invincible in our country. 
 I can imagine with what noble indignation a “Left Communist” will
recoil from these words, and what “devastating criticism” he will make
to the workers against the “Bolshevik deviation to the right”. What!
Transition to state capitalism in the Soviet Socialist
Republic would be a step forward?. . . Isn’t this the betrayal of
socialism? 
 Here we come to the root of the economic mistake of the
“Left Communists”. And that is why we must deal with this point in
greater detail. 
 Firstly, the “Left Communists” do not understand what kind of transition
it is from capitalism to socialism that gives us the right and the
grounds to call our country the Socialist Republic of Soviets. 
 Secondly, they reveal their petty-bourgeois mentality precisely by not
recognising the petty-bourgeois element as the principal
enemy of socialism in our country. 
 Thirdly, in making a bugbear of “state capitalism”, they betray
their failure to understand that the Soviet state differs from the
bourgeois state economically. 
 Let us examine these three points. 
 No one, I think, in studying the question of the economic system of
Russia, has denied its transitional character. Nor, I think, has any
Communist denied that the term Socialist Soviet Republic implies the
determination of Soviet power to achieve the transition to socialism,
and not that the new economic system is recognised as a socialist
order. 
 But what does the word “transition” mean? Does it not mean, as
applied to an economy, that the present system contains elements,
particles, fragments of both capitalism and socialism?
Everyone will admit that it does. But not all who admit this take the
trouble to consider what elements actually constitute the various
socio-economic structures that exist in Russia at the present time. And
this is the crux of the question. 
 Let us enumerate these elements: 
 1) patriarchal, i.e., to a considerable extent natural, peasant
farming; 
 2) small commodity production (this includes the
majority of those peasants who sell their grain); 
 3) private capitalism; 
 4) state capitalism; 
 5) socialism. 
 Russia is so vast and so varied that all these different types of
socio-economic structures are intermingled. This is what constitutes
the specific features of the situation. 
 The question arises: what elements predominate? Clearly in a
small-peasant country, the petty-bourgeois element predominates and it
must predominate, for the great majority of those working the land are
small commodity producers. The shell of our state capitalism (grain
monopoly, state controlled entrepreneurs and traders, bourgeois
co-operators) is pierced now in one place, now in another by profiteers,
the chief object of profiteering being grain. 
 It is in this field that the main struggle is being waged. Between
what elements is this struggle being waged if we are to speak in terms
of economic categories such as “state capitalism"? Between the fourth
and the fifth in the order in which I have just enumerated them. Of
course not. It is not state capitalism that is at war with socialism,
but the petty bourgeoisie plus private capitalism fighting together
against both state capitalism and socialism. The petty bourgeoisie
oppose every kind of state interference, accounting and
control, whether it be state capitalist or state socialist. This is an
absolutely unquestionable fact of reality, and the root of the economic
mistake of the “Left Communists” is that they have failed to understand
it. The profiteer, the commercial racketeer, the disrupter of
monopoly—these are our principal “internal” enemies, the enemies of the
economic measures of Soviet power. A hundred and twenty-five years ago
it might have been excusable for the French petty bourgeoisie, the most
ardent and sincere revolutionaries, to try to crush the profiteer by
executing a few of the “chosen” and by making thunderous declamations.
Today, however, the purely rhetorical attitude to this question assumed
by some Left Socialist-Revolutionaries can rouse nothing but disgust
and revulsion in every politically conscious revolutionary. We know
perfectly well that the economic basis of profiteering is both the
small proprietors, who are exceptionally widespread in Russia, and
private capitalism, of which every petty bourgeois is an
agent. We know that the million tentacles of this petty-bourgeois hydra
now and again encircle various sections of the workers, that, instead
of state monopoly, profiteering forces its way into every pore of
our social and economic organism. 
 Those who fail to see this show by their blindness that they are
slaves of petty-bourgeois prejudices. This is precisely the case with
our “Left Communists”, who in words (and of course in their deepest
convictions) are merciless enemies of the petty bourgeoisie, while in
deeds they help only the petty bourgeoisie, serve only this section of
the population and express only its point of view by fighting—in
April 1918!!—against . . . “state capitalism”. They are wide of
the mark! 
 The petty bourgeoisie have money put away, the few thousand that
they made during the war by “honest” and especially by dishonest means.
They are the characteristic economic type that serves as the basis of
profiteering and private capitalism. Money is a certificate entitling
the possessor to receive social wealth; and a vast section of small
proprietors, numbering millions, cling to this certificate and conceal
it from the “state”. They do not believe in socialism or communism, and
“mark time” until the proletarian storm blows over. Either we
subordinate the petty bourgeoisie to our control and
accounting (we can do this if we organise the poor, that is, the
majority of the population or semi-proletarians, around the politically
conscious proletarian vanguard), or they will overthrow our workers’

power as surely and as inevitably as the revolution was overthrown by
the Napoleons and Cavaignacs who sprang from this very soil of petty
proprietorship. This is how the question stands. Only the Left
Socialist Revolutionaries fail to see this plain and evident truth
through their mist of empty phrases about the “toiling” peasants. But
who takes these phrase-mongering Left Socialist-Revolutionaries
seriously? 
 The petty bourgeois who hoards his thousands is an enemy of state
capitalism. He wants to employ his thousands just for himself, against
the poor, in opposition to any kind of state control. And the sum total
of these thousands, amounting to many thousands of millions, forms the
base for profiteering, which undermines our socialist construction. Let
us assume that a certain number of workers produce in a few days values
equal to 1,000. Let us then assume that 200 of this total vanishes
owing to petty profiteering, various kinds of embezzlement and the
“evasion” by the small proprietors of Soviet decrees and regulations.
Every politically conscious worker will say that if better order and
organisation could be obtained at the price of 300 out of the 1,000 he
would willingly give 300 instead of 200, for it will be quite easy
under Soviet power to reduce this “tribute” later on to, say, 100 or
50, once order and organisation are established and once the
petty-bourgeois disruption of state monopoly is completely overcome. 
 This simple illustration in figures, which I have deliberately
simplified to the utmost in order to make it absolutely clear, explains
the present correlation of state capitalism and socialism.
The workers hold state power and have every legal opportunity of

“taking” the whole thousand, without giving up a single kopek, except
for socialist purposes. This legal opportunity, which rests upon the
actual transition of power to the workers, is an element of socialism. 
 But in many ways, the small proprietary and private capitalist
element undermines this legal position, drags in profiteering, hinders
the execution of Soviet decrees. State capitalism would be a gigantic
step forward even if we paid more than we are
paying at present (I took a numerical example deliberately to bring
this out more sharply), because it is worth while paying for “tuition”,
because it is useful for the workers, because victory over disorder,
economic ruin and laxity is the most important thing; because the
continuation of the anarchy of small ownership is the greatest, the
most serious danger, and it will certainly be our ruin
(unless we overcome it), whereas not only will the payment of a heavier
tribute to state capitalism not ruin us, it will lead us to socialism
by the surest road. When the working class has learned how to defend
the state system against the anarchy of small ownership, when it has
learned to organise large-scale production on a national scale, along
state capitalist lines, it will hold, if I may use the expression, all
the trump cards, and the consolidation of socialism will be assured. 
 In the first place, economically, state capitalism is
immeasurably superior to our present economic system. 
 In the second place, there is nothing terrible in it for Soviet
power, for the Soviet state is a state in which the power of the
workers and the poor is assured. The “Left Communists” failed to
understand these unquestionable truths, which, of course, a “Left
Socialist-Revolutionary”, who cannot connect any ideas on political
economy in his head in general, will never understand, but which every
Marxist must admit. It is not even worth while arguing with a
Left Socialist-Revolutionary. It is enough to point to him as a
“repulsive example” of a windbag. But the “Left Communists” must be
argued with because it is Marxists who are making a mistake, and an
analysis of their mistake will help the working class to find
the true road. 
IV 
 To make things even clearer, let us first of all take the most
concrete example of state capitalism. Everybody knows what this example
is. It is Germany. Here we have “the last word” in modern large-scale
capitalist engineering and planned organisation, subordinated to
Junker-bourgeois imperialism. Cross out the words in italics, and
in place of the militarist, Junker, bourgeois, imperialist state
put also a state, but of a different social type, of a
different class content—a Soviet state, that is, a
proletarian state, and you will have the sum total of the
conditions necessary for socialism. 
 Socialism is inconceivable without large-scale capitalist
engineering based on the latest discoveries of modern science. It is
inconceivable without planned state organisation, which keeps tens of
millions of people to the strictest observance of a unified standard in
production and distribution. We Marxists have always spoken of this,
and it is not worth while wasting two seconds talking to people who do
not understand even this (anarchists and a good half of the
Left Socialist-Revolutionaries). 
 At the same time socialism is inconceivable unless the proletariat
is the ruler of the state. This also is ABC. And history (which nobody,
except Menshevik blockheads of the first order, ever expected to bring
about “complete” socialism smoothly, gently, easily and simply) has
taken such a peculiar course that it has given birth in 1918
to two unconnected halves of socialism existing side by side like two
future chickens in the single shell of international imperialism. In
1918 Germany and Russia have become the most striking embodiment of the
material realisation of the economic, the productive and the
socio-economic conditions for socialism, on the one hand, and the
political conditions, on the other. 
 A successful proletarian revolution in Germany would immediately
and very easily smash any shell of imperialism (which unfortunately is
made of the best steel, and hence cannot be broken by the efforts of any

. . . chicken) and would bring about the victory of world socialism for
certain, without any difficulty, or with slight difficulty—if, of
course, by “difficulty” we mean difficult on a world historical scale,
and not in the parochial philistine sense. 
 While the revolution in Germany is still slow in “coming forth”,
our task is to study the state capitalism of the Germans, to spare no
effort in copying it and not shrink from adopting dictatorial
methods to hasten the copying of it. Our task is to hasten this copying
even more than Peter hastened the copying of Western culture by
barbarian Russia, and we must not hesitate to use barbarous methods in
fighting barbarism. If there are anarchists and Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries (I recall off-hand the speeches of Karelin
and Ghe at the meeting of the Central Executive Committee) who indulge
in Narcissus-like reflections and say that it is unbecoming for us
revolutionaries to “take lessons” from German imperialism, there is
only one thing we can say in reply: the revolution that took these
people seriously would perish irrevocably (and deservedly). 
 At present, petty-bourgeois capitalism prevails in Russia, and it
is one and the same road that leads from it to both
large-scale state capitalism and to socialism, through one
and the same intermediary station called “national accounting and
control of production and distribution”. Those who fail to understand
this are committing an unpardonable mistake in economics. Either they
do not know the facts of life, do not see what actually exists and are
unable to look the truth in the face, or they confine themselves to
abstractly comparing “capitalism” with “socialism” and fail to study
the concrete forms and stages of the transition that is taking place in
our country. Let it be said in parenthesis that this is the very
theoretical mistake which misled the best people in the Novaya
Zhizn and Vperyod camp. The worst and the mediocre of
these, owing to their stupidity and spinelessness, tag along behind the
bourgeoisie, of whom they stand in awe. The best of them have failed to
understand that it was not without reason that the teachers of
socialism spoke of a whole period of transition from capitalism to
socialism and emphasised the “prolonged birth pangs” of the new
society. And this new society is again an abstraction which can come
into being only by passing

through a series of varied, imperfect concrete attempts to create this
or that socialist state. 
 It is because Russia cannot advance from the economic situation now
existing here without traversing the ground which is common
to state capitalism and to socialism (national accounting and control)
that the attempt to frighten others as well as themselves with
“evolution towards state capitalism” (Kommunist No.
1, p. 8, col. 1) is utter theoretical nonsense. This is letting one’s
thoughts wander away from the true road of “evolution”, and failing to
understand what this road is. In practice, it is equivalent to pulling
us back to small proprietary capitalism. 
 In order to convince the reader that this is not the first time I
have given this “high” appreciation of state capitalism and that I gave
it before the Bolsheviks seized power I take the liberty of
quoting the following passage from my pamphlet  The Impending
Catastrophe and How to Combat It , written in September 1917. 
 “. . . Try to substitute for the Junker-capitalist state, for the
landowner-capitalist state, a revolutionary-democratic state,
i.e., a state which in a revolutionary way abolishes all privileges and
does not fear to introduce the fullest democracy in a revolutionary
way. You will find that, given a really revolutionary-democratic state,
state-monopoly capitalism inevitably and unavoidably implies a step,
and more than one step, towards socialism! 
 “. . . For socialism is merely the next step forward from
state-capitalist monopoly. 
 “. . . State-monopoly capitalism is a complete material
preparation for socialism, the threshold of socialism, a rung
on the ladder of history between which and the rung called socialism there
are no intermediate rungs
” (pages 27 and 28) 
 Please note that this was written when Kerensky was in power, that
we are discussing not the dictatorship of the proletariat, not
the socialist state, but the “revolutionary-democratic” state. Is it
not clear that the higher we stand on this political ladder, the
more completely we incorporate the socialist state and the
dictatorship of the proletariat in the Soviets, the less

ought we to fear “state capitalism"? Is it not clear that from the material,
economic and productive point of view, we are not yet on “the
threshold” of socialism? Is it not clear that we cannot pass through
the door of socialism without crossing “the threshold” we have not yet
reached? 
 From whatever side we approach the question, only one conclusion
can be drawn: the argument of the “Left Communists” about the “state
capitalism” which is alleged to be threatening us is an utter mistake
in economics and is evident proof that they are complete slaves of
petty-bourgeois ideology. 
 V
 The following is also extremely instructive. 
 When we argued with Comrade Bukharin in the Central Executive
Committee; see
present edition, Volume. 25, pages 358, 359.—Ed. he
declared, among other things, that on the question of high salaries for
specialists “we” (evidently meaning the “Left Communists") were “more
to the right than Lenin”, for in this case “we” saw no deviation from
principle, bearing in mind Marx’s words that under certain conditions
it is more expedient for the working class to “buy out the whole lot of
them”[2]

(namely, the whole lot of capitalists, i.e., to buy from the
bourgeoisie the land, factories, works and other means of production). 
 This extremely interesting statement shows, in the first place,
that Bukharin is head and shoulders above the Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries and anarchists, that he is by no means
hopelessly stuck in the mud of phrase-making, but on the contrary is
making efforts to think out the concrete difficulties of the
transition—the painful and difficult transition—from capitalism to
socialism. 
 In the second place, this statement makes Bukharin’s mistake still
more glaring. 
 Let us consider Marx’s idea carefully. 
 Marx was talking about the Britain of the seventies of the last
century, about the culminating point in the development of pre-monopoly
capitalism. At that time Britain was a country in which militarism and
bureaucracy were less pronounced than in any other, a country in which
there was the greatest possibility of a “peaceful” victory for
socialism in the sense of the workers “buying out” the bourgeoisie. And
Marx said that under certain conditions the workers would certainly not
refuse to buy out the bourgeoisie. Marx did not commit himself, or the
future leaders of the socialist revolution, to matters of form, to ways
and means of bringing about the revolution. He understood perfectly
well that a vast number of new problems would arise, that the whole
situation would change in the course of the revolution, and that the
situation would change radically and often in the
course of revolution. 
 Well, and what about Soviet Russia? Is it not clear that after
the seizure of power by the proletariat and after the
crushing of the exploiters’ armed resistance and sabotage, certain
conditions prevail which correspond to those which might have existed
in Britain half a century ago had a peaceful transition to socialism
begun there? The subordination of the capitalists to the workers in
Britain would have been assured at that time owing to the following
circumstances: (1) the absolute preponderance of workers, of
proletarians, in the population owing to the absence of a peasantry (in
Britain in the seventies there was hope of an extremely rapid spread of
socialism among agricultural labourers); (2) the excellent organisation
of the proletariat in trade unions (Britain was at that time the
leading country in the world in this respect); (3) the comparatively
high level of culture of the proletariat, which had been trained by
centuries of development of political liberty; (4) the old habit of the
well-organised British capitalists of settling political and economic
questions by compromise—at that time the British capitalists were
better organised than the capitalists of any country in the world (this
superiority has now passed to Germany). These were the circumstances
which at that time gave rise to the idea that the peaceful
subjugation of the British capitalists by the workers was possible. 
 In our country, at the present time, this subjugation is assured by
certain premises of fundamental significance (the victory in October
and the suppression, from October to February, of the capitalists’
armed resistance and sabotage). But instead of the absolute
preponderance of workers, of proletarians, in the population, and instead
of a high degree of organisation among them, the important factor
of victory in Russia was the support the proletarians received from the
poor peasants and those who had experienced sudden ruin. Finally, we
have neither a high degree of culture nor the habit of compromise. If
these concrete conditions are carefully considered, it will become
clear that we can and ought to employ two methods simultaneously.
On the one hand we must ruthlessly suppress[3] the uncultured capitalists
who refuse to have anything to do with “state capitalism” or to
consider any form of compromise, and who continue by means of
profiteering, by bribing the poor peasants, etc., to hinder the
realisation of the measures taken by the Soviets. On the other hand, we
must use the method of compromise, or of buying off the
cultured capitalists who agree to “state capitalism”, who are capable
of putting it into practice and who are useful to the proletariat as
intelligent and experienced organisers of the largest types
of enterprises, which actually supply products to tens of millions of
people. 
 Bukharin is an extremely well-read Marxist economist. He therefore
remembered that Marx was profoundly right when he taught the workers
the importance of preserving the organisation of large-scale
production, precisely for the purpose of facilitating the transition to
socialism. Marx taught that (as an exception, and Britain was then an
exception) the idea was conceivable of paying the capitalists well,
of buying them off, if the circumstances were such as to
compel the capitalists to submit peacefully and to come over to
socialism in a cultured and organised fashion, provided they were paid.

 But Bukharin went astray because he did not go deep enough into the
specific features of the situation in Russia at the present time—an
exceptional situation when we, the Russian proletariat, are in advance
of any Britain or any Germany as regards our political order, as
regards the strength of the workers’ political power, but are behind

the most backward West-European country as regards organising a good
state capitalism, as regards our level of culture and the degree of
material and productive preparedness for the “introduction” of
socialism. Is it not clear that the specific nature of the present
situation creates the need for a specific type of “buying out” which
the workers must offer to the most cultured, the most skilled, the most
capable organisers among the capitalists who are ready to enter the
service of Soviet power and to help honestly in organising “state”
production on the largest possible scale? Is it not clear that in this
specific situation we must make, every effort to avoid two mistakes,
both of which are of a petty-bourgeois nature? On the one hand, it
would be a fatal mistake to declare that since there is a discrepancy
between our economic “forces” and our political strength, it “follows”
that we should not have seized power.[4] Such an argument can be advanced only by a “man in a muffler”,[5] who
forgets that there will always be such a “discrepancy”, that it always
exists in the development of nature as well as in the development of
society, that only by a series of attempts—each of which, taken by
itself, will be one sided and will suffer from certain
inconsistencies—will complete socialism be created by the revolutionary
co-operation of the proletarians of all countries. 
 On the other hand, it would be an obvious mistake to give free rein
to ranters and phrase-mongers who allow themselves to be carried away
by the “dazzling” revolutionary spirit, but who are incapable of
sustained, thoughtful and deliberate revolutionary work which takes
into account the most difficult stages of transition. 
 Fortunately, the history of the development of the revolutionary
parties and of the struggle that Bolshevism waged against them has left
us aheritage
of sharply defined types, of which the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries
and anarchists are striking examples of bad revolutionaries. They are
now shouting hysterically, choking and shouting themselves hoarse,
against the “compromise” of the “Right Bolsheviks”. But they are
incapable of thinking what is bad in “compromise”, and why

“compromise” has been justly condemned by history and the course of the
revolution. 
 Compromise in Kerensky’s time meant the surrender of power to the
imperialist bourgeoisie, and the question of power is the fundamental
question of every revolution. Compromise by a section of the Bolsheviks
in October November 1917 either meant that they feared the proletariat
seizing power or wished to share power equally, not only with
“unreliable fellow-travellers” like the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries,
but also with the enemies, with the Chernovists and the Mensheviks. The
latter would inevitably have hindered us in fundamental matters, such
as the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the ruthless
suppression of the Bogayevskys, the universal setting up of the Soviet
institutions, and in every act of confiscation. 
 Now power has been seized, retained and consolidated in the hands
of a single party, the party of the proletariat, even without the
“unreliable fellow-travellers”. To speak of compromise at the present
time when there is no question, and can be none, of sharing power,
of renouncing the dictatorship of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie,
is merely to repeat, parrot-fashion, words which have been learned by
heart but not understood. To describe as “compromise” the fact that,
having arrived at a situation when we can and must rule the country, we
try to win over to our side, not grudging the cost, the most skilled
people capitalism has trained and to take them into our service against
small proprietary disintegration, reveals a total incapacity to think
out the economic tasks of socialist construction. 
 Therefore, while it is to Comrade Bukharin’s credit that on the
Central Executive Committee he “felt ashamed” of the “service” he had
been rendered by Karelin and Ghe, nevertheless, as far as the “Left
Communist” trend is concerned, the reference to their
political comrades-in-arms still remains a serious warning. 
 Take, for example, Znamya Truda, the organ of the Left
Socialist-Revolutionaries, of April 25, 1918, which proudly declares,

“The present position of our party coincides with that of another trend
in Bolshevism (Bukharin, Pokrovsky and others)”. Or take the Menshevik Vperyod
of the same date, which contains among other articles the following
“thesis” by the notorious Menshevik Isuv: 
 “The policy of Soviet power, from the very outset devoid of a
genuinely proletarian character, has lately pursued more and more
openly a course of compromise with the bourgeoisie and has assumed an
obviously anti-working class character. On the pretext of nationalising
industry, they are pursuing a policy of establishing industrial trusts,
and on the pretext of restoring the productive forces of the country,
they are attempting to abolish the eight hour day, to introduce
piece-work and the Taylor system, black lists and victimisation. This
policy threatens to deprive the proletariat of its most important
economic gains and to make it a victim of unrestricted exploitation by
the bourgeoisie.” 
 Isn’t it marvellous? 
 Kerensky’s friends, who, together with him, conducted an
imperialist war for the sake of the secret treaties, which promised
annexations to the Russian capitalists, the colleagues of Tsereteli,
who, on June 11, threatened to disarm the workers,[6] the
Lieberdans, who screened the rule of the bourgeoisie with high-sounding
phrases—these are the very people who accuse Soviet power of “compromising
with the bourgeoisie”, of “establishing trusts” (that is, of
establishing “state capitalism"!), of introducing the Taylor system. 
 Indeed, the Bolsheviks ought to present Isuv with a medal, and his
thesis ought to be exhibited in every workers’ club and union as an
example of the provocative speeches of the bourgeoisie. The
workers know these Lieberdans, Tseretelis and Isuvs very well now. They
know them from experience, and it would be extremely useful indeed for
the workers to think over the reason why such lackeys of the
bourgeoisie should incite the workers to resist the Taylor system
and the “establishment of trusts”. 
 Class-conscious workers will carefully compare the “thesis” of
Isuv, a friend of the Lieberdans and the Tseretelis, with the following
thesis of the “Left Communists”. 
 “The introduction of labour discipline in connection with the
restoration of capitalist management of industry cannot considerably
increase the productivity of labour, but it will diminish the class
initiative, activity and organisation of the proletariat. It threatens
to enslave the worklng class; it will rouse discontent among the
backward elements as well as among the vanguard of the proletariat. In
order to implement this system in the face of the hatred prevailing
among the proletariat against the ’capitalist saboteurs’, the Communist
Party would have to rely on the petty bourgeoisie, as against the
workers, and in this way would ruin itself as the party of the
proletariat” (Kommunist No. 1, p. 8, col. 2). 
 This is most striking proof that the “Lefts” have fallen into the
trap, have allowed themselves to be provoked by the Isuvs and the other
Judases of capitalism. It serves as a good lesson for the workers, who
know that it is precisely the vanguard of the proletariat which stands
for the introduction of labour discipline, and that it is precisely the
petty bourgeoisie which is doing its utmost to disrupt this discipline.
Speeches such as the thesis of the “Lefts” quoted above are a terrible
disgrace and imply the complete renunciation of communism in practice
and complete desertion to the camp of the petty bourgeoisie. 
 “In connection with the restoration of capitalist management"—these
are the words with which the “Left Communists” hope to “defend
themselves”. A perfectly useless defence, because, in the first place,
when putting “management” in the hands of capitalists Soviet power
appoints workers’ Commissars or workers’ committees who watch the
manager’s every step, who learn from his management experience and who
not only have the right to appeal against his orders, but can secure
his removal through the organs of Soviet power. In the second place,

“management” is entrusted to capitalists only for executive functions
while at work, the conditions of which are determined by the Soviet
power, by which they may be abolished or revised. In the third place,
“management” is entrusted by the Soviet power to capitalists not as
capitalists, but as technicians or organisers for higher salaries. And
the workers know very well that ninety-nine per cent of the organisers
and first-class technicians of really Iarge-scale and
giant enterprises, trusts or other establishments belong to the
capitalist class. But it is precisely these people whom we, the
proletarian party, must appoint to “manage” the labour process and the
organisation of production, for there are no other people who
have practical experience in this matter. The workers, having grown out
of the infancy when they could have been misled by “Left” phrases or
petty-bourgeois loose thinking, are advancing towards socialism
precisely through the capitalist management of trusts, through gigantic
machine industry, through enterprises which have a turnover of several
millions per year—only through such a system of production and such
enterprises. The workers are not petty bourgeois. They are not afraid
of large-scale “state capitalism”, they prize it as their proletarian

weapon which their Soviet power will use against small
proprietary disintegration and disorganisation. 
 This is incomprehensible only to the declassed and consequently
thoroughly petty-bourgeois intelligentsia, typified among the “Left
Communists” by Osinsky, when he writes in their journal: 
 “. . . The whole initiative in the organisation and manage ment of
any enterprise will belong to the ‘organisers of the
trusts’. We are not going to teach them, or make rank-and-file workers
out of them, we are going to learn from them” (Kommunist No.
1, p. 14, col. 2). 
 The attempted irony in this passage is aimed at my words “learn
socialism from the organisers of the trusts”. 
 Osinsky thinks this is funny. He wants to make “rank and-file
workers” out of the organisers of the trusts. If this had been written
by a man of the age of which the poet wrote “But fifteen years, not
more?. . .“[7] there
would have been nothing surprising about it. But it is somewhat strange
to hear such things from a Marxist who has learned that socialism is
impossible unless it makes use of the achievements of the engineering
and culture created-by large scale capitalism. There is no trace of
Marxism in this. 
 No. Only those are worthy of the name of Communists who understand
that it is impossible to create or introduce socialism without
learning from the organisers of the trusts. For socialism is not a
figment of the imagination, but the assimilation and application by the
proletarian vanguard, which has seized power, of what has been created
by the trusts. We, the party of the proletariat, have no other way

of acquiring the ability to organise large-scale production on trust
lines, as trusts are organised, except by acquiring it from first-class
capitalist experts. 
 We have nothing to teach them, unless we undertake the childish
task of “teaching” the bourgeois intelligentsia socialism. We must not
teach them, but expropriate them (as is being done in Russia
“determinedly” enough), put a stop to their sabotage, subordinate
them as a section or group to Soviet power. We, on the other hand, if
we are not Communists of infantile age and infantile understanding,
must learn from them, and there is something to learn, for the party of
the proletariat and its vanguard have no experience of
independent work in organising giant enterprises which serve the needs
of scores of millions of people. 
 The best workers in Russia have realised this. They have begun to
learn from the capitalist organisers, the managing engineers and the
technicians. They have begun to learn steadily and cautiously with easy
things, gradually passing on to the more difficult things. If things
are going more slowly in the iron and steel and engineering industries,
it is because they present greater difficulties. But the textile and
tobacco workers and tanners are not afraid of “state capitalism” or of
“learning from the organisers of the trusts”, as the declassed
petty-bourgeois intelligentsia are. These workers in the central
leading institutions like Chief Leather Committee and Central Textile
Committee take their place by the side of the capitalists, learn
from them, establish trusts, establish “state capitalism”, which
under Soviet power represents the threshold of socialism, the condition
of its firm victory. 
 This work of the advanced workers of Russia, together with their
work of introducing labour discipline, has begun and is proceeding
quietly, unobtrusively, without the noise and fuss so necessary to some
“Lefts”. It is proceeding very cautiously and gradually, taking into
account the lessons of practical experience. This hard work, the work
of learning practically how to build up large-scale
production, is the guarantee that we are on the right road, the
guarantee that the class-conscious workers in Russia are carrying on
the struggle against small proprietary disintegration and
disorganisation, against petty-bourgeois indiscipline[8]—the guarantee
of the victory of communism. 
 Two remarks in conclusion. 
 In arguing with the “Left Communists” on April 4, 1918 (see Kommunist
No. 1, p. 4, footnote), I put it to them bluntly: “Explain what you are
dissatisfied with in the railway decree; submit your
amendments to it. It is your duty as Soviet leaders of the proletariat
to do so, otherwise what you say is nothing but empty phrases.”  
 The first issue of Kommunist appeared on April 20, 1918,
but did not contain a single word about how, according to the
“Left Communists”, the railway decree should be altered or amended. 
 The “Left Communists” stand condemned by their own silence. They
did nothing but attack the railway decree with all sorts of
insinuations (pages 8 and 16 of No. 1), they gave no

articulate answer to the question, “How should the decree be amended if
it is wrong?” 
 No comment is needed. The class-conscious workers will call such
“criticism” of the railway decree (which is a typical example of our
line of action, the line of firmness, the line of dictatorship, the
line of proletarian discipline) either “Isuvian” criticism or empty
phrase-making. 
 Second remark. The first issue of Kommunist contained a
very flattering review by Comrade Bukharin of my pamphlet The State
and Revolution. But however much I value the opinion of people
like Bukharin, my conscience compels me to say that the character

of the review reveals a sad and significant fact. Bukharin regards the
tasks of the proletarian dictatorship from the point of view of the past
and not of the future. Bukharin noted and emphasised what the
proletarian revolutionary and the petty-bourgeois revolutionary may
have in common on the question of the state. But Bukharin “overlooked”
the very thing that distinguishes the one from the other. 
 Bukharin noted and emphasised that the old state machinery must be
“smashed” and “blown up”, that the bourgeoisie must be “finally and
completely strangled” and so on. The frenzied petty bourgeoisie may
also want this. And this, in the main, is what our revolution has already

done between October 1917 and February 1918. 
 In my pamphlet I also mention what even the most revolutionary
petty bourgeois cannot want, what the class-conscious proletarian does
want, what our revolution has not yet accomplished. On this
task, the task of tomorrow, Bukharin said nothing. 
 And I have all the more reason not to be silent on this point,
because, in the first place, a Communist is expected to devote greater
attention to the tasks of tomorrow, and not of yesterday, and, in the
second place, my pamphlet was written before the Bolsheviks
seized power, when it was impossible to treat the Bolsheviks to vulgar
petty-bourgeois arguments such as: “Yes, of course, after

seizing power, you begin to talk about discipline.” 
 “. . . Socialism will develop into communism . . . since people
will become accustomed to observing the elementary conditions of social
life without violence and without subordination.” [The
State and Revolution, pages 77-78]; thus, “elementary
conditions” were discussed before the seizure of power.) 
 “. . . Only then will democracy begin to wither away . . ." when “people
gradually become accustomed to observing the elementary rules of social
intercourse that have been
known for centuries and repeated for thousands of years in all
copy-book maxims; they will become accustomed to observing them without
force, without coercion, without the special apparatus for coercion
called the state” [The State and Revolution,
page 462.]; thus mention was made of “copy-book maxims” before

the seizure of power). 
 “. . . The higher phase of the development of communism” (from each
according to his ability, to each according to his needs) “. . .
presupposes not the present productivity of labour and not the present
ordinary run of people, who, like the seminary students in
Pomyalovsky’s stories, are capable of damaging the stocks of public
wealth just for fun, and of demanding the impossible” [The State and Revolution, pages pages 469-470.]

 “Until the higher phase of communism arrives, the socialists demand
the strictest control by society and by the state over the measure of
labour and the measure of consumption . . .” (ibid.). 
 “Accounting and control—that is mainly what is needed for the
smooth working, for the proper functioning of the first phase of
communist society” [The State and Revolution,
page 473.] And this control must be established not only over
“the insignificant capitalist minority, over the gentry who wish to
preserve their capitalist habits”, but also over the workers who “have
been thoroughly corrupted by capitalism”[The
State and Revolution, page 474.] and over the “parasites,
the sons of the wealthy, the swindlers and other guardians of
capitalist traditions” (ibid.). 
 It is significant that Bukharin did not emphasise this.

quickly enough a sufficient number of proflteers, racketeers and

The “ability” to do this can only be acquired by establishing
accounting and control! Another thing is that the courts are not

[4] Lenin has
in mind one of the basic arguments used by the Mensheviks against the
October Socialist Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.
The Mensheviks maintained that the seizure of power was “premature”,
that Russia had not yet achieved a high enough development of the
productive forces for socialism to be feasible. After the October
Revolution they continued to oppose Soviet power and revolutionary
socialist reforms. 
 These Menshevik views were summed up in a book by
N. Sukhanov, Notes on the Revolution, which Lenin criticised
in his article “Our Revolution (Appropos the Notes of N. Sukhanov)”.
Refuting the Menshevik idea that the socialist revolution in Russia was
“premature” because of economic and cultural backwardness, Lenin wrote
that the working class of Russia must begin with the winning of state
power by revolutionary means “and then, with the aid of the workers’

and peasants’ government and the Soviet system, proceed to overtake the
other nations” (Selected Works, Vol. 3, p. 822).

All-Russia Congress of Soviets held to discuss the matter on June 11
(24), 1917, the Menshevik I. G. Tsereteli made a viciously slanderous

quoting V. L. Pushkin’s epigram about a mediocre poet who sent his

How long such rumbling odes composed?

“He is fifteen,” Erato made reply.

“But fifteen years?” “No more, my lord.”

“Then shall the birch be his reward!“

extremely characteristic

that the authors of the theses do not say a single word ahout the
significance of the dictatorship of the prolotariat in the economic
sphere. They talk only of the “organisation” and so on. But that is
accepted also by the petty bourgeoisie, who shun dictatorship
by the workers in economic relations. A proletarian rovolutionary could
never at such a moment “forget” this core of the proletarian
revolution, which is directed against the economic foundations of
capitalism.

I

      The extreme instability of the international situation of the
      Soviet Republic, surrounded as it is by imperialist powers, has
      been frequently pointed out in the Bolshevik press and has been
      admitted in the resolutions of the higher organs of Soviet
      power.

    
      During the past few days, i.e., the first ten days of May 1918,
      the political situation has become extremely critical owing to
      both external and internal causes:

    
      First, the direct offensive of the counter-revolutionary forces
      (Semyonov and others) with the aid of the Japanese in the Far
      East has been stepped up, and in connection with it there are a
      number of signs indicating the possibility of the entire
      anti-German imperialist coalition coming to an agreement on the
      presentation of an ultimatum to Russia either fight against
      Germany, or there will be a Japanese invasion aided by us.

    
      Secondly, since Brest the war party has gained the upper hand in
      German politics in general, and this party could now, at any
      moment, gain the upper hand on the question of an immediate
      general offensive against Russia, i.e., it could completely
      overcome the other policy of German bourgeois-imperialist
      circles that strive for fresh annexations in Russia but for the
      time being want peace with her and not a general offensive
      against her.

    
      Thirdly, the restoration of bourgeois-landowner monarchism in
      the Ukraine with the support of the Constitutional-Democratic
      and Octobrist elements of the bourgeoisie of all Russia arid
      with the aid of the German troops was bound to make the struggle
      against the counter-revolution in Russia more intense., was
      bound to encourage the plans and raise the spirit of our
      counter-revolutionaries.

    
      Fourthly, the disorganised food situation has become extremely
      acute and in many places has led to real hunger because we were
      cut off from Rostov-on-Don and because of the efforts of the
      petty bourgeoisie and the capitalists in general to sabotage the
      grain monopoly, accompanied by insufficiently firm, disciplined
      and ruthless opposition on the part of the ruling class, i.e.,
      the proletariat, to those strivings, efforts and attempts.
    
II

      The foreign policy of Soviet power must not be changed in any
      way. Our military preparations are not yet complete, and our
      general slogan. therefore, will remain as
      before—manoeuvre, withdraw, bide our time, and continue
      our preparations with all our. might.

    
      Although we do not ill general reject military agreements with
      one of the imperialist coalitions against the other ill those
      cases in which such an agreement could, without undermining the
      basis of Soviet power, strengthen its position and paralyze the
      attacks of any imperialist power, we cannot at the present
      moment enter into a military agreement with the Anglo-French
      coalition. For them, the importance of such an agreement would
      be the diversion of German troops from the West, i.e., by means
      of the advance of many Japanese army corps into the interior of
      European Russia, which is an unacceptable condition since it
      would mean the complete collapse of Soviet power. If the
      Anglo-French coalition were to present us with an ultimatum of
      this kind we should reject it, because the danger of the
      Japanese advance can more easily be paralysed (or can be delayed
      for a longer time) than the threat of the Germans occupying
      Petrograd, Moscow and a large part of European Russia.
    
III

      In considering the tasks of the foreign policy of Soviet power
      at the present moment, the greatest caution, discretion and
      restraint must be observed in order not to hel the extreme
      elements in the war parties of Japan and Germany by any
      ill-considered or hasty step.

    
      The fact of the matter is that the extreme elements in the war
      parties of both these countries favour an immediate general
      offensive against Russia for the purpose of occupying all her
      territory and overthrowing Soviet power. At any moment these
      extreme elements may gain the upper hand.

    
      On the other hand, however, it is an undoubted fact that the
      majority of the imperialist bourgeoisie in Germany are against
      such a policy and at the present moment prefer the annexationist
      peace with Russia to a continuation of the war for the simple
      reason that war would divert forces from the West and increase
      the instability of the internal situation in Germany that is
      already making itself felt; it would also make it difficult to
      obtain raw materials from places involved in insurrection or
      that are suffering from damage to railways, from failure to
      plant sufficient crops, etc., etc.

    
      The Japanese urge to attack Russia is being held back, first, by
      the danger of the movement and of revolts in China, and
      secondly, there is a certain antagonism on the part of America,
      the latter fearing the strengthening of Japan and hoping to
      obtain raw materials from Russia more easily under peaceful
      conditions.

    
      It goes without saying that it is quite possible for the extreme
      elements of the war parties in both Germany and Japan to gain
      the upper hand at any moment. There can be no guarantee against
      this until the revolution breaks out in Germany. The American
      bourgeoisie may plot together with the Japanese bourgeoisie, or
      the Japanese with the German. It is, therefore, our imperative
      duty to make the most energetic preparations for war.

    
      As long as there remains even a slight chance of preserving
      peace or of concluding peace with Finland, the Ukraine and
      Turkey, at the cost of certain new annexations or losses, we
      must not take a single step that might aid the extreme elements
      in the war parties of the imperialist powers.
    
IV

      The primary task in undertaking more energetic military
      training, as in the question of combating famine, is that of
      orgainsation.

    
      There cannot be any really serious preparation for war unless
      the food difficulties are overcome, unless the population is
      properly supplied with bread, unless the strictest order is
      introduced on the railways, unless truly iron discipline is
      established among the masses of the working people (and not only
      at the top). It is in this field that we are most backward.

    
      Guiltiest of all of a complete lack of understanding of this
      truth are the Left Socialist-Revolutionary and anarchist
      elements with their screaming about “insurrectionary
      committees” and their howls of “to arms”,
      etc. Such screams and howls are the quintessence of stupidity
      and are nothing but pitiful, despicable and disgusting
      phrase-making; it is ridiculous to talk about
      “insurrection” and “insurrectionary
      committees” when Soviet central power is doing its utmost
      to persuade the people to start military training and arm
      themselves, when we have more weapons than we can count and
      distribute, when it is precisely the economic ruin and the lack
      of discipline that prevent us from using the weapons available
      and compel us to lose valuable time that could be used for
      training.

    
      Intensified military training for a serious war cannot be done
      by means of a sudden impulse, a battle-cry, a militant slogan;
      it requires lengthy, intense, persistent and disciplined work on
      a mass scale. We must deal ruthlessly with the Left
      Socialist-Revolutionary and anarchist elements that do not wish
      to understand this, and must not give them an opportunity to
      infect certain elements of our proletarian Communist Party with
      their hysteria.
    
V

      It is essential to wage a ruthless struggle against the
      bourgeoisie, which on account of the above circumstances has
      raised its head during the past few days, and to declare a state
      of emergency, close newspapers, arrest the leaders and so
      on. These measures are as necessary as the military campaign
      against the rural bourgeoisie, who are holding back grain
      surpluses and infringing the grain monopoly. There will he no
      salvation either from the counter-revolution or from famine
      without iron discipline on the part of the proletariat.

    
      In particular it must be borne in mind tat during the past few
      days the bourgeoisie have been making extremely skilful and
      cunning use of panic-spreading as a weapon against proletarian
      power. Some of our comrades, especially those who are less
      resolute in their attitude to the Left Socialist-Revolutionary
      and anarchist revolutionary phrases, have allowed themselves to
      be diverted, have got into a panic or have failed to observe the
      line that divides legitimate and necessary warning of the coming
      danger from the spreading of panic.

    
      The basic specific features of the entire present economic and
      political situation in Russia must be kept firmly in mind;
      because of these features our cause cannot be helped by
      outbursts. We must become firmly convinced ourselves and try to
      convince all workers of the truth that only restraint and
      patient creative work to establish iron proletarian discipline,
      including ruthless measures against hooligans, kulaks and
      disorganising elements, can protect Soviet power at this moment,
      one of the most difficult and dangerous periods of transition,
      unavoidable owing to the delay of the revolution in the West.

Theses on the Present Political Situation were drafted
      by Lenin on May 10, 1918 and discussed on the same day at a
      meeting of the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Part
      (Bolsheviks). The final, edited version of the theses was
      approve by the Central Committee on May 13; all members of the
      Central Committee who attended the meeting voted in favour,
      except G. Y. Sokolnikov and J. V. Stalin. Later, the majority of
      members of the Central Committee living in Petrograd gave their
      support to the theses. The Central Committee entrusted Lenin
      with the task of making the reports to the Moscow City
      Conference of the R.C.P.(B.) and the Joint Meeting of the
      All-Russia C.E.C. and the Moscow Soviet, and of moving these

## On The Famine











On The Famine A Letter To The Workers Of Petrograd

On The Famine
A Letter To The Workers Of Petrograd[1]

Comrades, the other day your delegate, a Party comrade, a worker in the Putilov Works, called on me. This comrade drew a detailed and extremely harrowing picture of the famine in Petrograd. We all know that the food situation is just as acute in many of the industrial gubernias, that famine is knocking just as cruelly at the door of the workers and the poor generally.

And side by side with this we observe an orgy of profiteering in grain and other food products. The famine is not due to the fact that there is no grain in Russia, but to the fact that the bourgeoisie and the rich generally are putting up a last decisive fight against the rule of the toilers, against the state of the workers, against Soviet power, on this most important and acute of issues, the issue of bread. The bourgeoisie and the rich generally, including the rural rich, the kulaks, are thwarting the grain monopoly; they are disrupting the distribution of grain undertaken by the state for the purpose and in the interests of supplying bread to the whole of the population, and in the first place to the workers, the toilers, the needy. The bourgeoisie are disrupting the fixed prices, they are profiteering in grain, they are making a hundred, two hundred and more rubles’ profit on every pood of grain; they are disrupting the grain monopoly and the proper distribution of grain by resorting to bribery and corruption and by deliberately supporting everything tending to destroy the power of the workers, which is endeavouring to put into effect the prime, basic and root principle of socialism: “He who does not work, neither shall he eat.”
“He who does not work, neither shall he eat”—every toiler understands that. Every worker, every poor and even middle peasant, everybody who has suffered need in his lifetime, everybody who has ever lived by his own labour, is in agreement with this. Nine-tenths of the population of Russia are in agreement with this truth. In this simple, elementary and perfectly obvious truth lies the basis of socialism, the indefeasible source of its strength, the indestructible pledge of its final victory.

But the whole point is that it is one thing to subscribe to this truth, to swear one’s allegiance to it, to give it verbal recognition, but it is quite different to be able to put it into effect. When hundreds of thousands and millions of people are suffering the pangs of hunger (in Petrograd, in the non-agricultural gubernias, and in Moscow) in a country where millions upon millions of poods of grain are being concealed by the rich, the kulaks, and the profiteers-in a country which calls itself a socialist Soviet Republic-there is something to which every conscious worker and peasant must give serious and profound thought.

“He who does not work, neither shall he eat”—how is this to be put into effect? It is as clear as daylight that in order to put it into effect we require, first, a state grain monopoly, i.e., the absolute prohibition of all private trade in grain, the compulsory delivery of all surplus grain to the state at a fixed price, the absolute prohibition of all hoarding and concealment of surplus grain, no matter by whom. Secondly, we require the strictest registration of all grain surpluses, faultless organisation of the transportation of grain from places of abundance to places of shortage, and the building up of reserves for consumption, for processing, and for seed. Thirdly, we require a just and proper distribution of bread, controlled by the workers’ state, the proletarian state, among all the citizens of the state, a distribution which will permit of no privileges and advantages for the rich.

One has only to reflect ever so slightly on these conditions for coping with the famine to see the abysmal stupidity of the contemptible anarchist windbags, who deny the necessity of a state power (and, what is more, a power ruthless in its severity towards the bourgeoisie and ruthlessly firm towards disorganisers of government) for the transition from capitalism to communism and for the ridding of the working people of all forms of oppression and exploitation. It is at this moment, when our revolution has directly, concretely, and practically approached the tasks involved in the realisation of socialism-and therein lies its inestimable merit-it is at this moment, and exactly in connection with this most important of issues, the issue of bread, that the need becomes absolutely clear for an iron revolutionary rule, for a dictatorship of the proletariat, for the organisation of the collection of food products, their transportation, and distribution on a mass, national scale, taking into account the requirements of tens and hundreds of millions of people, calculating the conditions and the results of production for a year and many years ahead (for there are sometimes years of crop failure, sometimes land improvements essential for increasing grain crops require years of work, and so forth).

Romanov and Kerensky left to the working class a country utterly impoverished by their predatory, criminal, and most terrible war, a country picked clean by Russian and foreign imperialists. Bread will suffice for all only if we keep the strictest account of every pood, only if every pound is distributed absolutely evenly. There is also an acute shortage of bread for machines, i.e., fuel; the railways and factories will come to a standstill, unemployment and famine will bring ruin on the whole nation, if we do not bend every effort to establish a strict and ruthless economy of consumption and proper distribution. We are faced by disaster, it is very near. An intolerably difficult May will be followed by a still more difficult June, July and August.

Our state grain monopoly exists in law, but in practice it is being thwarted at every step by the bourgeoisie. The rural rich, the kulak, the parasite who has been robbing the whole neiglibourliood for decades, prefers to enrich himself by profiteering and illicit distilling.. it is so good for his pocket, and he can throw the blame for the famine on Soviet power. That, too, is the line of the political defenders of the kulak-the Constitutional-Democrats, the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, and the Mensheviks-who are overtly and covertly “working” against the grain monopoly and against Soviet power. The party of the spineless, i.e., the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, are displaying their spinelessness here too: they are yielding to the covetous howls and outcries of the bourgeoisie, they are crying out against the grain monopoly, they are “protesting” against the food dictatorship, they are allowing themselves to be intimidated by the bourgeoisie, they are afraid to fight the kulak, and are flapping about hysterically, recommending that the fixed prices be raised, that private trading be permitted, and so forth.

This party of the spineless reflects in politics something akin to what takes place in ordinary life when the kulak incites the poor peasants against the Soviets, bribes them by, say, letting some poor peasant have a pood of grain not for six, but for three rubles, so that the poor peasant, thus corrupted, may himself “make a bit” by profiteering, may “turn a penny” by selling that pood of grain at a profiteering price of one hundred and fifty rubles, and himself become a decrier of the Soviets, which have prohibited private trading in grain.

Anyone who is capable of reflecting, anyone who is willing to reflect ever so little, will see clearly what line this fight has taken.

Either the advanced and class-conscious workers triumph and unite the poor peasant masses around themselves, establish rigorous order, a mercilessly severe rule, a genuine dictatorship of the proletariat-either they compel the kulak to submit, and institute a proper distribution of food and fuel on a national scale; or the bourgeoisie, with the help of the kulaks, and with the indirect support of the spineless and muddle-headed (the anarchists and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries), will overthrow Soviet power and set up a Russo-German or a Russo-Japanese Kornilov, who will present the people with a sixteen-hour working day, an ounce of bread per week, mass shooting of workers and torture in dungeons, as has been the case in Finland and the Ukraine.
Either—or.

There is no middle course.

The situation of the country is desperate in the extreme.

Anyone who reflects upon political life cannot fail to see that the Constitutional-Democrats,. the Right SocialistRevolutionaries, and the Mensheviks are coming to an understanding about who would be “pleasanter”, a RussoGerman or a Russo-Japanese Kornilov, about who would crush the revolution more effectively and reliably, a crowned or a republican Kornilov.

It is time all class-conscious and advanced workers came to an understanding. It is time they bestirred themselves and realised that every minute’s delay may spell ruin to the country and ruin to the revolution.

Half-measures will be of no avail. Complaining will lead us nowhere. Attempts to secure bread or fuel “in retail fashion”, “each man for himself”, i.e., for “o-ur” factory, “our” workshop, are only increasing the disorganisation and facilitating for the profiteers their selfish, filthy, and blackguardly work.

That is why, comrades, workers of Petrograd, I have taken the liberty of addressing this letter to you. Petrograd is not Russia. The Petrograd workers are only a small part of the workers of Russia. But they are one of the best, the advanced, most class-conscious, most revolutionary, most steadfast detachments of the working class and of all the working people of Russia, and one of the least liable to succumb to empty phrases, to spineless despair and to the intimidation of the bourgeoisie. And it has frequently happened at critical moments in the life of nations that even small advanced detachments of advanced classes have carried the rest with them, have fired the masses with revolutionary enthusiasm, and have accomplished tremendous historical feats.

“There were forty thousand of us at the Putilov Works,” the delegate from the Petrograd workers said to me. “But the majority of them were ’temporary’ workers, not proletarians, an unreliable, flabby lot. Now there are fifteen thousand left, but these are proletarians, tried and steeled in the fight.”

That is the sort of vanguard of the revolution-in Petrograd and throughout the country-that must sound the call, must rise together, must understand that the salvation of the country is in their hands, that from them is demanded a heroism no less than that which they displayed in January and October 1905 and in February paid October 1917, that a great “crusade” must be organised against the grain profiteers, the kulaks, the parasites, the disorganisers and bribetakers, a great “crusade” against the violators of strictest state order in the collection, transportation, and distribution of bread for the people and bread for the machines.

The country and the revolution can be saved only by the mass effort of the advanced workers. We need tens of thousands of advanced and steeled proletarians, class-conscious enough to explain matters to the millions of poor peasants all over the country and to assume the leadership of these millions, resolute enough to ruthlessly cast out of their midst and shoot all who allow themselves to be “tempted” as indeed happens-by the temptations of profiteering and turn from fighters for the cause of the people into robbers; we need proletarians steadfast enough and devoted enough to the revolution to bear in an organised way all the hardships of the crusade and take it to every corner of the country for the establishment of order, for the consolidation of the local organs of Soviet power, and for the exercise of control in the localities over every pood of grain and every pood of fuel.

It is rather more difficult to do this than to display heroism for a few days without leaving one’s accustomed place, without joining in a crusade, confining oneself to an impulsive uprising against the idiot monster Romanov or the fool and braggart Kerensky. Heroism displayed in prolonged and persevering organisational work on a national scale is immensely more difficult than, but at the same time immensely superior to, heroism displayed in an uprising. But the strength of working-class parties, the strength of the working class has always been that it looks danger boldly, squarely and openly in the face, that it does not fear to admit danger and soberly weighs the forces in “our”  camp and in “the other” camp, the camp of the exploiters. The revolution is progressing, developing, and growing. The tasks we face are also growing. The struggle is broadening and deepening. Proper distribution of bread and fuel, their procurement in greater quantities and the very strict account and control of them by the workers on a national scale-that is the real and chief prelude to socialism. That is no longer a “general revolutionary” task but a communist task, a task which requires that the working people and the poor engage capitalism in a decisive battle.

And this battle is worth giving all one’s strength to it; the difficulties are grea’c, but so is the cause of the abolition of oppression and exploitation for which we are fighting.

When the people are starving, when unemployment is becoming ever more terrible, anyone who conceals an extra pood of grain, anyone who deprives the state of a pood of fuel is an out-and-out criminal.

At such a time-and for a genuinely communist society, it is always true-every pood of grain and fuel is veritably sacred, much more so than the sacred things which priests use to confuse the minds of fools, promising them the kingdom of heaven as a reward for slavery on earth. And in order to rid this genuinely sact.ed thing of every remnant of the “sacredness” of the priests, we must take possession of it practically, we must achieve its proper distribution in practice, we must collect the whole of it without exception; every particle of surplus grain must be brought into the state stores, the whole country must be swept clean of concealed or ungarnered grain surpluses; we need the firm hand of the worker to harness every effort to increase the output of fuel and to secure the greatest economy of fuel, the greatest efficiency in its transportation and consumption.

We need a mass “crusade” of the advanced workers to every centre of production of grain and fuel, to every important centre of supply and distribution-a mass “crusade” to increase the intensity of work tenfold, to assist the local organs of Soviet power in the matter of accounting and control, and to eradicate profiteering, graft, and slovenliness by armed force. This is not a new task. History, properly speaking, is not advancing new tasks-all it is doing is to increase the size and scope of old tasks as the scope of the revolution, its difficulties, and the greatness of its worldhistoric aim increase.

One of the greatest and indefeasible accomplishments of the October Revolution-the Soviet revolution-is that the advanced worker, as the leader of the poor, as the leader of the toiling masses of the countryside, as the builder of the state of the toilers, has “gone among the people.”

Petrograd and other proletarian centres have given thousands upon thousands of their best workers to the countryside. The detachments of fighters against the Kaledins and Dutoys, and the food detachments, are nothing new. Only the proximity of disaster, the acuteness of the situation compel us to do ten times more than before.

When the worker became the vanguard leader of the poor he did not thereby become a saint. He led the people forward, but he also became infected with the diseases of petty-bourgeois disintegration. The fewer the detachments of best organised, of most class-conscious, and most disciplined and steadfast workers were, the more frequently did these detachments degenerate, the more frequently did the small-proprietor instincts of the past triumph over the proletarian-communist consciousness of the future.

Having begun the communist revolution, the working class cannot instantly discard the weaknesses and vices inherited from the society of landowners and capitalists, the society of exploiters and parasites, the society based on the filthy selfishness and personal gain of a few and the poverty of the many. But the working class can vanquish the old world—and in the end will certainly and inevitably vanquish it—with its vices and weaknesses, if against the enemy are brought ever greater detachments of workers, ever more enlightened by experience and tempered by the hardships of the struggle.

Such and only such is the state of affairs in Russia today. Single-handed and disunited, we shall not be able to cope with famine and unemployment. We need a mass “crusade” of advanced workers to every corner of this vast country. We need ten times more iron detachments of the proletariat, class-conscious and boundlessly devoted to communism. Then we shall triumph over famine and unemployment. Then we shall make the revolution the real prelude to socialism, and then, too, we shall be in a position to conduct a victorious war of defense against the imperialist vultures.

[1] On the Famine (A Letter to the Petrograd Workers) was written by Lenin after a conversation with A. V. Ivanov, chairman of the Putilov (now Kirov) Works purchasing commission. Lenin paid close attention to what the Putilov workers’ representative had to say, then asked him to tell the Petrograd workers that the Government was “taking resolute measures to improve the country’s food situation” and handed him a copy of a decree to pass on to the Putilov workers. The decree gave the People’s Commissar for Food emergency powers to fight the famine. In a letter to A. D. Tsyurupa, Lenin wrote of his conversation with Ivanov: “I told him my opinion: if the best Petrograd workers do not create a picked, reliable workers’ army” for a campaign against the rural bourgeoisie, “famine and the destruction of the revolution are inevitable” (Lenin Miscellany XVIII, p. 163). Lenin told the People’s Commissariat for Food to give every assistance to the Petrograd workers’ detachments.
 
At the beginning of June 1918, the Petrograd workers sent off
their first food detachment of 400 men.

Comrades, permit me first of all to greet the Congress of Commissars for Labour in the name of the Council of People’s Commissars. (Enthusiastic applause.)


At yesterday’s session of the Council of People’s Commissars, Comrade Shlyapnikov reported that your Congress had subscribed to the resolution of the trade unions on labour discipline and production rates. Comrades, I believe you have taken an important step in passing this resolution, which not only deals with the productivity of labour and production conditions, but is also a very important step in principle from the standpoint of the present situation in general. Your contact with the broad masses of the workers is constant and a matter of business and not merely a casual contact, and you know that our revolution is experiencing one of the most important and critical moments of its development.


You are fully aware that our enemies, the Western imperialists, are lying in wait for us, and that there may perhaps come a time when they will turn their hordes loose on us. That external enemy is now being joined by another dangerous enemy-the internal enemy-the disruption, chaos and disorganisation that are being intensified by the bourgeoisie in general and by the petty bourgeoisie in particular, and by various yes-men and hangers-on of the bourgeoisie. You know, comrades, that after the most brutal war, in which we were involved by the tsarist regime and by the collaborators headed by Kerensky, we were left with a heritage of disruption and extreme economic ruin. We now have to face the most critical moment, when hunger and unemployment are knocking at the door of an increasing number of workers, when hundreds and thousands of people are suffering the pangs of hunger, when the situation is being aggravated by there being no bread when there could be bread, when we know that the proper distribution of bread depends on proper transport of grain. The shortage of fuel since we have been cut off from the rich fuel regions, the catastrophic condition of the railways that may possibly be threatened with a stoppage of trafficsuch are the conditions that breed difficulties for the revolution and fill with joy the hearts of the Kornilovites of all kinds and colours. They are now daily, hourly, perhaps, discussing how to take advantage of the difficulties of the Soviet Republic and proletarian power, how to again place a Kornilov on the throne. They are now arguing about what nationality the new Kornilov is to be-it must be someone who suits the bourgeoisie, whether he wears a crown or is a republican Kornilov. The workers now know what the matter is, and after what the Russian revolution has experienced since Kerensky, they are not a bit surprised. But the strength of the working-class organisation, of the working-class revolution, lies in our not closing our eyes to the truth, in our realising the exact state of affairs.


We have said that the war, such is its scale and incredible brutality, threatens the complete destruction of European civilisation. The only possible salvation is for the workers to take over power and establish strict law and order. Since 1905 the proletariat of Russia has for a certain time moved far ahead of the other international armies of the proletariat because of the course taken by the Russian revolution and a special historical situation. We have now reached the stage when the revolution is maturing in all West-European countries, when it is becoming clear that the situation of the armies of German workers is hopeless. We know that over there in the West, the working people are not confronted with the rotten regime of Romanov and empty boasters but by a bourgeoisie that is fully organised and can rely on all the achievements of modern civilisation and engineering. That is why it was so easy for us to start the revolution and more difficult to continue it, and why over there in the West it will be more difficult to start and easier to continue. Our difficulty is that everything has to be done by the efforts of the proletariat of Russia alone, and that we have to maintain our position until our ally, the international proletariat of all countries, grows strong enough. Every day impresses it on us that there is no other way out. Our position is made more difficult because, without reinforcements, we are faced with disorganisation on the railways, with transport and food disruptions. There the question must be presented in a way that is clear to everyone.


I hope that the Congress of Commissars for Labour, which is in more immediate contact with the workers than anybody else-that this Congress will not only mark a stage in the direct improvement of those labour arrangements which we must make the basis of socialism, but that it will also serve to clear the minds of the workers in respect of the situation we are at present experiencing. The working class is confronted with a difficult but honourable task on which the fate of socialism in Russia depends, and probably in other countries, too. That is why a resolution on labour discipline is so important.


Now that power is firmly in the hands of the workers, everything depends on proletarian discipline and proletarian organisation. It is a question of discipline and the dictatorship of the proletariat, a question of iron rule. The type of government that meets with the warmest sympathy and very determined support of the poor must be as strong as iron, because incredible calamities are advancing upon us. A large section of the workers are living under the impression of the old and hope that we shall somehow manage to get out of the present situation.


Every day, however, these illusions are being shattered, and it is becoming more and more obvious that the world war threatens whole countries with famine and decay if the working class does not overcome the economic ruin by means of its organisational ability. Side by side with the politically conscious section of the working class whose entire activity is devoted to making the new discipline of comradeship the basis of everything, we see the many millions of petty property-owners, the petty-bourgeois element, who look at everything from the standpoint of their own narrow interests. We cannot fight against the famine an disaster that are approaching, other than by establishing the iron discipline of the politically conscious workers-without it we can do nothing. Because of the huge extent of Russia we are living under conditions in which there is a lot of bread at one end of the country and none at the other. It is no use consoling ourselves with the thought that the war of defence that may be forced on us will not take place. It must not be thought that the towns and the huge industrial centres can be fed if food is not delivered regularly. Every pood of grain must be recorded so that not a single pood is wasted. We know, however, that no such record is really made, except on paper. In real life the petty profiteers are only corrupting the village poor by impressing on them that private trading can make up for their shortages. We cannot get out of the crisis under those conditions. In Russia there can be enough bread for the people and enough bread, i.e., fuel, for industry, only if everything we have is strictly divided among all citizens so that nobody can take an extra pound of bread and not a single pound of fuel can remain unused. That is the only way to save the country from famine. That is a lesson in communist distribution everything accounted for, so that there is enough bread for the people and enough fuel for industry—and it is not a lesson taken from a book, it is one we have arrived at through bitter experience.


The broad masses of the workers may not immediately realise that we are face to face with disaster. What is needed is a workers’ crusade against disorganisation and against the concealment of grain. And a crusade is needed to establish throughout the country the labour discipline you have passed a resolution on and have been talking about within the limits of the factories; the masses must be made to understand that there is no other way out. In the history of our revolution, the strength of the politically conscious workers has always been their ability to look the most bitter and dangerous reality straight in the face, to harbour no illusions but calculate their forces exactly. We can count on the politically conscious workers alone; the remaining mass, the bourgeoisie and the petty proprietors, are against us; they do not believe in the new order and take advantage of every opportunity to worsen the plight of the people. What we see in the Ukraine and in Finland may serve as an example: the incredible atrocities and the seas of blood in which the bourgeoisie and its supporters, from the Constitutional-Democrats to the Socialist-Revolutionaries, are drowning the towns they conquer with the aid of their allies. All this goes to show what awaits the proletariat in the future if it does not fulfil its historic task. We know how small is the section of advanced and politically conscious workers in Russia. We also know the plight of the people and know that the broad masses are certain to realise that we cannot get out of the situation by half-measures, that there will have to be a proletarian revolution. We live at a time when countries are being ruined and millions of people are doomed to perish or subjected to military slavery. Hence, the revolution that history has forced on us, not by the evil will of individuals, but because the entire capitalist system is breaking up, because its foundations are cracking.


Comrades, Commissars for Labour, make use of every meeting you hold at any factory, of your talks with delegations of workers, make use of every opportunity to explain the situation, so that the workers know that we are faced with either destruction or self-discipline, organisation and the possibility to defend ourselves. Let them know that we are faced with a return of the Kornilovs—Russian, German or Japanese Kornilovs—who will bring a ration of an ounce of bread a week if the politically conscious workers, at the head of all the poor, do not organise a crusade against the chaos and disorganisation which the petty bourgeoisie are everywhere intensifying, and which we must put down. It is a question of every politically conscious worker feeling that he is not only the master in his own factory but that he is also a representative of the country, of his feeling his responsibility. The politically conscious worker must know that he is a representative of hiselass. He must win if he takes the lead in the movement against the bourgeoisie and the profiteers. The politically conscious worker will understand what the main task of the socialist is, and then we shall win. Then we shall find the forces and shall be able to fight. (Loud, prolonged applause.)

Comrades, permit me first of all to greet the Congress of Economic Councils in the name of the Council of People’s Commissars. (Applause.)

Comrades, the Supreme, Economic Council now has a difficult, but a most rewarding task. There is not the slightest doubt that the further the gains of the October Revolution go, the more profound the upheaval it started becomes, the more firmly the socialist revolution’s gains become established and the socialist system becomes consolidated, the greater and higher will become the role of the Economic Councils, which alone of all the state institutions are to endure. And their position will become all the more durable the closer we approach the establishment of the socialist system and the less need there will be for a purely administrative apparatus, for an apparatus which is solely engaged in administration. After the resistance of the exploiters has been finally broken, after the working people have learned to organise socialist production, this apparatus of administration in the proper, strict, narrow sense of the word, this apparatus of the old state, is doomed to die; while the apparatus of the type of the Supreme Economic Council is destined to grow, to develop and become strong, performing all the main activities of organised society.



That is why, comrades, when I look at the experience of our Supreme Economic Council and of the local councils, with the activities of which it is closely and inseparably connected, I think that, in spite of much that is unfinished, incomplete and unorganised, we have not even the slightest grounds for pessimistic conclusions. For the task which the Supreme Economic Council sets itself, and the task which all the regional and localcouncils set themselves, is so enormous, so all embracing, that there is absolutely nothing that gives rise to alarm in what we all observe. Very often—of course, from our point of view, perhaps too often—the proverb “measure thrice and cut once” has not been applied. Unfortunately, things are not so simple in regard to the organisation of the economy on socialist lines as they are expressed in that proverb.



With the transition of all power—this time not only political and not even mainly political, but economic power, that is, power that affects the deepest foundations of everyday human existence—to a new class, and, moreover, to a class which for the first time in the history of humanity is the leader of the overwhelming majority of the population, of the whole mass of the working and exploited people—our tasks become more complicated.



It goes without saying that in view of the supreme importance and the supreme difficulty of the organisational tasks that confront us, when we must organise the deepest foundations of the existence of hundreds of millions of people on entirely new lines, it is impossible to arrange matters as simply as in the proverb “measure thrice and cut once”. We, indeed, are not in a position to measure a thing innumerable times and then cut out and fix what has been finally measured and fitted. We must build our economic edifice as we go along, trying out various institutions, watching their work, testing them by the collective common experience of the working people, and, above all, by the results of their work. We must do this as we go along, and, moreover, in a situation of desperate struggle and frenzied resistance by the exploiters, whose frenzy grows the nearer we come to the time when we can pull out the last bad teeth of capitalist exploitation. It is understandable that if even within a brief period we have to alter the types, the regulations and the bodies of administration in various branches of the national economy several times, there are not the slightest grounds for pessimism in these conditions, although, of course, this gives considerable grounds for malicious outbursts on the part of the bourgeoisie and the exploiters, whose best feelings are hurt. Of course, those who take too close and too direct a part in this work, say, the Chief Water Board, do not always find it pleasant to alter the regulations, the norms and the laws of administration three times; the pleasure obtained from work of this kind cannot be great. But if we abstract ourselves somewhat from the direct unpleasantness of extremely frequent alteration of decrees, and if we look a little deeper and further into the enormous world historic task that the Russian proletariat has to carry out with the aid of its own still inadequate forces, it will become immediately understandable that even far more numerous alterations and testing in practice of various systems of administration and various forms of discipline are inevitable; that in such a gigantic task, we could never claim, and no sensible socialist who has ever written on the prospects of the future ever even thought, that we could immediately establish and compose the forms of organisation of the new society, according to some predetermined instruction and at one stroke.



All that we knew, all that the best experts on capitalist society, the greatest minds who foresaw its development, exactly indicated to us was that transformation was historically inevitable and must proceed along a certain main line, that private ownership of the means of production was doomed by history, that it would burst, that the exploiters would inevitably be expropriated. This was established with scientific precision, and we knew this when we grasped the banner of socialism, when we declared ourselves socialists, when we founded socialist parties, when we transformed society. We knew this when we took power for the purpose of proceeding with socialist reorganisation; but we could not know the forms of transformation, or the rate of development of the concrete reorganisation. Collective experience, the experience of millions can alone give us decisive guidance in this respect, precisely because, for our task, for the task of building socialism, the experience of the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of those upper sections which have made history up to now in feudal society and in capitalist society is insufficient. We cannot proceed in this way precisely because we rely on joint experience, on the experience of millions of working people.



We know, therefore, that organisation, which is the main and fundamental task of the Soviets, will inevitably entail a vast number of experiments, a vast number of steps, a vast number of alterations, a vast number of difficulties, particularly in regard to the question of how to fit every person into his proper place, because we have no experience of this; here we have to devise every step ourselves, and the more serious the mistakes we make on this path, the more the certainty will grow that with every increase in the membership of the trade unions, with every additional thousand, with every additional hundred thousand that come over from the camp of working people, of exploited, who have hitherto lived according to tradition and habit, into the camp of the builders of Soviet organisations, the number of people who should prove suitable and organise the work on proper lines is increasing.



Take one of the secondary tasks that the Economic Council—the Supreme Economic Council—comes up against with particular frequency, the task of utilising bourgeois experts. We all know, at least those who take their stand on the basis of science and socialism, that this task can be fulfilled only when that this task can be fulfilled only to the extent that international capitalism has developed the material and technical prerequisites of labour, organised on an enormous scale and based on science, and hence on the training of an enormous number of scientifically educated specialists. We know that without this socialism is impossible. If we reread the works of those socialists who have observed the development of capitalism during the last half-century, and who have again and again come to the conclusion that socialism is inevitable, we shall find that all of them without exception have pointed out that socialism alone will liberate science from its bourgeois fetters, from its enslavement to capital, from its slavery to the interests of dirty capitalist greed. Socialism alone will make possible the wide expansion of social production and distribution on scientific lines and their actual subordination to the aim of easing the lives of the working people and of improving their welfare as much as possible. Socialism alone can achieve this. And we know that it must achieve this, and in the understanding of this truth lies the whole complexity and the whole strength of Marxism.



We must achieve this while relying on elements which are opposed to it, because the bigger capital becomes the more the bourgeoisie suppresses the workers. Now that power is in the hands of the proletariat and the poor peasants and the government is setting itself tasks with the support of the people, we have to achieve these socialist changes with the help of bourgeois experts who have been trained in bourgeois society, who know no other conditions, who cannot conceive of any other social system. Hence, even in cases when these experts are absolutely sincere and loyal to their work they are filled with thousands of bourgeois prejudices, they are connected by thousands of ties, imperceptible to themselves, with bourgeois society, which is dying and decaying and is therefore putting up furious resistance.



We cannot conceal these difficulties of endeavour and achievement from ourselves. Of all the socialists who have written about this, I cannot recall the work of a single socialist or the opinion of a single prominent socialist on future socialist society, which pointed to this concrete, practical difficulty that would confront the working class when it took power, when it set itself the task of turning the sum total of the very rich, historically inevitable and necessary for us store of culture and knowledge and technique accumulated by capitalism from an instrument of capitalism into an instrument of socialism. It is easy to do this in a general formula, in abstract reasoning, but in the struggle against capitalism, which does not die at once but puts up increasingly furious resistance the closer death approaches, this task is one that calls for tremendous effort. If experiments take place in this field, if we make repeated corrections of partial mistakes, this is inevitable because we cannot, in this or that sphere of the national economy, immediately turn specialists from servants of capitalism into servants of the working people, into their advisers. If we cannot do this at once it should not give rise to the slightest pessimism, because the task which we set ourselves is a task of world-historic difficulty and significance. We do not shut our eyes to the fact that in a single country, even if it were a much less backward country than Russia, even if we were living in better conditions than those prevailing after four years of unprecedented, painful, severe and ruinous war, we could not carry out the socialist revolution completely, solely by our own efforts. He who turns away from the socialist revolution now taking place in Russia and points to the obvious disproportion of forces is like the conservative “man in a muffler” who cannot see further than his nose, who forgets that not a single historical change of any importance takes place without there being several instances of a disproportion of forces. Forces grow in the process of the struggle, as the revolution grows. When a country has taken the path of profound change, it is to the credit of that country and the party of the working class which achieved victory in that country, that they should take up in a practical manner the tasks that were formerly raised abstractly, theoretically. This experience will never be forgotten. The experience which the workers now united in trade unions and local organisations are acquiring in the practical work of organising the whole of production on a nationial scale cannot betaken away,no matter how difficult the vicissitudes the Russian revolution and the international socialist revolution may pass through. It has gone down in history as socialism’s gain, and on it the future world revolution will erect its socialist edifice.



Permit me to mention another problem, perhaps the most difficult problem, for which the Supreme Economic Council has to find a practical solution. This is the problem of labour discipline. Strictly speaking, in mentioning this problem, we ought to admit and emphasise with satisfaction that it was precisely the trade unions, their largest organisations, namely, the Central Committee of the Metalworkers’ Union and the All-Russia Trade Union Council, the supreme trade union organisations uniting millions of working people, that were the first to set to work independently to solve this problem and this problem is of world-historic importance. In order to understand it we must abstract ourselves from those partial, minor failures, from the incredible difficulties which, if taken separately, seem to be insurmountable. We must rise to a higher level and survey the historical change of systems of social economy. Only from this angle will it be possible to appreciate the immensity of the task which we have undertaken. Only then will it be possible to appreciate the enormous significance of the fact that on this occasion, the most advanced representatives of society, the working and exploited people are, on their own initiative, taking on them selves the task which hitherto, in feudal Russia, up to 1861, was solved by a handful of landed proprietors, who regarded it as their own affair. At that time it was their affair to bring about state integration and discipline.



We know how the feudal landowners created this discipline. It was oppression, humiliation and the incredible torments of penal servitude for the majority of the people. Recall the whole of this transition from serfdom to the bourgeois economy. From all that you have witnessed—although the majority of you could not have witnessed it—and from all that you have learned from the older generations, you know how easy, historically, seemed the transition to the new bourgeois economy after 1861, the transition from the old feudal discipline of the stick, from the discipline of the most senseless, arrogant and brutal humiliation and personal violence, to bourgeois discipline, to the discipline of starvation, to so-called free hire, which in fact was the discipline of capitalist slavery. This was because mankind passed from one exploiter to another; because one minority of plunderers and exploiters of the people’s labour gave way to another minority’, who were also plunderers and exploiters of the people’s labour; because the feudal landowners gave way to the capitalists, one minority gave way to another minority, while the toiling and exploited classes remained oppressed. And even this change from one exploiter’s discipline to another exploiter’s discipline took years, if not decades, of effort; it extended ever a transition period of years, if not decades. During this period the old feudal landowners quite sincerely believed that everything was going to rack and ruin, that it was impossible to manage the country without serfdom; while the new, capitalist boss encountered practical difficulties at every step and gave up his enterprise as a bad job. The material evidence, one of the substantial proofs of the difficulty of this transition was that Russia at that time imported machinery from abroad, in order to have the best machinery to use, and it turned out that no one was available to handle this machinery, and there were no managers. And all over Russia one could see excellent machinery lying around unused, so difficult was the transition from the old feudal discipline to the new, bourgeois, capitalist discipline.



And so, comrades, if you look at the matter from this angle, you will not allow yourselves to be misled by those people, by those classes, by those bourgeoisie and their hangers-on whose sole task is to sow panic, to sow despondency, to cause complete despondency concerning the whole of our work, to make it appear to be hopeless, who point to every single case of indiscipline and corruption, and for that reason give up the revolution as a bad job, as if there has ever been in the world, in history, a single really great revolution in which there was no corruption, no loss of discipline, no painful experimental steps, when the people were creating a new discipline. We must not forget that this is the first time that this preliminary stage in history has been reached, when a new discipline, labour discipline, the discipline of comradely contact, Soviet discipline, is being created in fact by millions of working and exploited people. We do not claim, nor do we expect, quick successes in this field. We know that this task will take an entire historical epoch. We have begun this historical epoch, an epoch in which we are breaking up the discipline of capitalist society in a country which is still bourgeois, and we are proud that all politically conscious workers, absolutely all the toiling peasants are everywhere helping this destruction; an epoch in which the people voluntarily, on their own initiative, are becoming aware that they must not on instructions from above, but on the instructions of their own living experience change this discipline based on the exploitation and slavery of the working people into the new discipline of united labour, the discipline of the united, organised workers and working peasants of the whole of Russia, of a country with a population of tens and hundreds of millions. This is a task of enormous difficulty, but it is also a thankful one, because only when we solve it in practice shall we have driven the last nail into the coffin of capitalist society which we are burying. (Applause.)

The First All-Russia Congress of Economic Councils was held May 26 to June 4, 1918, in Moscow; it was attended by 252 delegates representing 5 regional, 30 gubernia and a considerable number of nyezd economic councils, and also departments of the Supreme Economic Council, trade union organisations and factory trade union committees.
    
Lenin took a direct part in preparing the Congress. At a meeting of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council, which was held in the Kremlin onMay 23, and attended by Lenin, matters connected with the Congress were examined in detail; the agenda was decided upon and the theses of a number of reports were approved with alterations and ainendments. During the discussion of the theses of G. D. Veinberg’s report on the management of the nationalised enterprises Lenin moved that the system of managing nationalised enterprises should be cut down to include only factory management beards on the spot and a central managing board-the production department of the Supreme Economic Council-all intermediate boards being eliminated. Other items included in the Congress agenda were: the economic consequences of the Brest Treaty; Russia’s general economic position and economic policy; the work of the Supreme Economic Council; Russia’s financial position; the state budget; foreign trade; the Committee of State Construction; reports from the provinces. Some of the questions were examined by the committees on the organisation of production, labour, trade and agriculture.
    
At the opening session of the Congress Lenin made a speech outlining the immediate tasks of economic construction and the organisation of management of the nationalised economy. Lenin’s plan for the organisation of socialist production and management on the principle of democratic centralism was opposed at the Congress by the “Left Communists”, the anarcho-syndicalists, the Mensheviks and the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries. The Statute drawn up under Lenin’s direction was passed by the Congress. The Congress also took important decisions on other questions, following the principles set out by Lenin. These were on the need for carrying out further socialist nationalisation, on trade between town and country, and on the reorganisation of the Supreme Eco- nomic Council. The Congress worked out measures for improving labour discipline and raising the productivity of labour and declared the production of agricultural machines and implements to be a matter of primary state importance.
