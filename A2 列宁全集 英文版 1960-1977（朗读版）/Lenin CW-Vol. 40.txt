426-427PREFACE The present volume contains Lenin’s Notebooks on the Agrarian Question, which is preparatory material for his works analysing capitalist agriculture in Western Europe, Russia and the United States, and criticising bourgeois and petty-bourgeois theories, and reformism and revisionism in the agrarian question.
The material in this volume relates to the period from 1900 to 1916.
In the new conditions, with capitalism at its highest and final stage—the stage of imperialism—Lenin worked out and substantiated the agrarian programme and agrarian policy of the revolutionary proletarian party, and took Marxist theory on the agrarian question a step forward in its view of classes and the class struggle in the country-side, the alliance of the working class and the peasantry under the leadership of the proletariat, and their joint struggle against the landowners and capitalists, for demo-cracy and socialism.
The success of the revolution depended on whom the peasantry would follow, for in many European countries it constituted the majority or a sizable section of the population.
In order to win over the peasantry, as an ally of the proletariat in the coming revolution, it was necessary to expose the hostile parties which claimed leader-ship of the peasantry, and their ideologists.
In the new epoch, these questions became especially pressing and acquired international significance.
That is why bourgeois economists, reformists and revisionists fiercely attacked Marxism.
It was subjected to crit-icism by bourgeois apologists, the ideologists of petty-bourgeois parties, and opportunists among the Social-Democrats.
They all rejected Marx’s theory of ground-rent,and the law of concentration of production in agriculture, and denied the advantages of large-over small-scale produc-tion; they insisted that agriculture developed according to special laws, and was subject to the inexorable “law of diminishing returns”.
They said it was not human labour and the implements of labour, but the elemental forces of nature that were decisive in agriculture.
These “critics of Marx” juggled with the facts and statistics, in an effort to show that the small-scale peasant economy was “stable” and had advantages over large-scale capitalist production.
Lenin’s great historical service in working out the agra-rian question lies in the fact that he defended Marx’s revolu-tionary teaching against the attacks of his “critics”, and further developed it in application to the new historical conditions and in connection with the working out of the pro-gramme, strategy and tactics of the revolutionary proletarian party of the new type; he proved the possibility, and the necessity, of an alliance between the working class and the peasantry under the leadership of the proletariat at the various stages of the revolution, and showed the conditions in which this could be realised.
It was of tremendous importance to produce a theoretical elaboration of the agrarian question so as to determine the correct relations between the working class and the various groups of peasantry as the revolutionary struggle went forward.
Under capitalism, the peasantry breaks up into different class groups, with differing and antithetical inter-ests; the “erosion” of the middle peasantry yields a numer-ically small but economically powerful rich peasant (kulak) top section at one pole, and a mass of poor peasants, rural proletarians and semi-proletarians, at the other.
Lenin revealed the dual nature of the peasant as a petty commo-dity producer—the dual nature of his economic and political interests: the basic interests of the toiler suffering from exploitation by the landowner and the kulak, which makes him look to the proletariat for support, and the interests of the owner, which determine his gravitation towards the bourgeoisie, his political instability and vacilla-tion between it and the working class.
Lenin emphasised the need for an alliance between the working class and the peasantry, with the leading role belonging to the proletariat,as a prerequisite for winning the dictatorship of the prole-tariat and building socialism through a joint effort by the workers and peasants.
* * * The first part of the volume contains the plans and out-lines of Lenin’s writings on the agrarian question, the main being the preparatory materials for “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” (see present edition, Vols.
5 and 13).
The variants of the plan for this work give a good idea of how Lenin mapped out the main line and the con-crete points for his critique of reformist bourgeois theories and of revisionism.
Lenin defined a programme for processing the relevant reliable material from numerous sources to refute the arguments of the “critics of Marx” concerning the dubious “law of diminishing returns” and the Malthu-sian explanation of the root causes of the working man’s plight, and to ward off their attacks on the Marxist theory of ground-rent, etc.
In preparing “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” and his lectures on the agrarian question, Lenin made a thorough study of the most important sources, and utilised European agrarian statistics to give Marxist agrarian theory a sound basis.
He verified, analysed and summed up a mass of statistical data, and drew up tables giving an insight into the deep-going causes, nature and social significance of economic processes.
Lenin’s analysis of agrarian statistics shows their tremendous importance as a tool in cognising economic laws, exposing the contra-dictions of capitalism, and subjecting it and its apologists to scientific criticism.
The writings in the first part of the volume show the direct connection between Lenin’s theoretical inquiry, his elaboration of Marxist agrarian theory and the practical revolutionary struggle of the working class.
The preparatory materials for his lectures on the “Marxist Views of the Agrarian Question in Europe and Russia”, and on “The Agrarian Programme of the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries and of the Social-Democrats”, both included in this volume, are a reflection of an important stage of Lenin’s struggle against the petty-bourgeois party of Socialist-Revolutionaries and opportunists within the Social-Demo-cratic movement, in working out and substantiating a truly revolutionary agrarian programme and tactics for the Marxist working-class party in Russia.
Russia was then on the threshold of her bourgeois-demo-cratic revolution.
In Russia, capitalism had grown into imperialism, while considerable survivals of serfdom still remained in the country’s economy and the political system as a whole.
The landed estates were the main relicts of pre-capitalist relations in the economy; the peasant allotment land tenure, adapted to the landowners’ corvée system, was also shackled with relicts of serfdom.
These tended to slow down the development of the productive forces both in Russia’s industry and agriculture, widen the tech-nical and economic gap separating her from the leading capitalist countries of the West, and create the conditions for indentured forms of exploitation of the working class and the peasantry.
That is why the agrarian question was basic to the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Russia and determined its specific features.
Lenin laid special emphasis on the importance of theory in working out the Party programme: “In order to make a comparison of the programmes and to assess them, it is nec-essary to examine the principles, the theory, from which the programme flows” (see p.
53).
Lenin’s theoretical analysis of the economic nature of the peasant economy enabled him to determine correctly the community or the distinction of class interests between the proletariat and the various sections of the peasantry in the bourgeois-democratic revo-lution, and to map out the Party’s policy towards the peasantry.
The main task of the agrarian programme during the bourgeois-democratic revolution was to formulate the demands that would secure the peasantry as the proletariat’s ally in the struggle against tsarism and the landowners.
“The meaning of our agrarian programme: the Russian prole-tariat (including the rural) must support the peasantry in the struggle against serfdom” (see p.
62).
Lenin subjected the agrarian programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries to withering criticism and proved that their theoretical unscrupulousness and eclecticism had induced them to say nothing of the historical task of the period—destruction of therelicts of serfdom—to deny the stratification of the peasantry along class lines, and the class struggle in the countryside, to invent all manner of projects for “socialisation of land”, “equalisation”, etc.
While Lenin aimed his criticism against the Socialist-Revolutionaries, he also exposed the anti-Marxist stand on the agrarian issue in Russia and the peasantry taken by P.
P.
Maslov, A.
S.
Martynov, D.
B.
Ryazanov and other Mensheviks-to-be, who denied that the peasantry had a revolutionary role to play, and who regarded it as a solid reactionary mass.
By contrast, Lenin emphasised the dual nature of Narodism: the democratic side, inasmuch as they waged a struggle against the relicts of serfdom, and the utopian and reactionary side, expressive of the urge on the part of the petty bourgeois to perpetuate his small farm.
In this context, Lenin pointed to the need to take account of the two sides of Narodism in evaluating its historical importance.
The first part ends with two plans for “The Peasantry and Social-Democracy” (see pp.
69-70).
These plans warrant the assumption that Lenin had the intention of writing a special work on the subject to sum up his studies of agrar-ian relations and the experience gained by socialist parties abroad in working out agrarian programmes, and to sub-stantiate the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
’s policy towards the peasantry.
With his usual insight, he points to the “practical impor-tance of the agrarian question in the possibly near future” (see p.
70), and notes the specific nature of class relations in the Russian countryside, and the need for the rural proletariat to fight on two flanks: against the landowners and the relicts of serfdom, and against the bourgeoisie.
Lenin marked out the guiding principles which were to serve the Marxist party as a beacon in the intricate condi-tions of the class struggle in the countryside: “Together with the peasant bourgeoisie against the landowners.
To-gether with the urban proletariat against the peasant bourgeoisie” (see p.
69).
The writings in the second part of the present volume are a reflection of his critical processing of a great mass of facts and statistical data from bourgeois and petty-bourgeois agrarian works and official sources.
Of specialinterest in this part is the material on the study and proc-essing of the results of special statistical inquiries into the state of agriculture, especially the peasant economy, in a number of European countries.
Lenin gives a model of scientific analysis of agrarian relations, application of the Marxist method in processing social and economic statistics, and critical use of bourgeois sources and writings.
Lenin adduces reliable data to refute the assertions of bourgeois economists, reformists and revi-sionists, and shows that in agriculture as well large-scale capitalist production is more effective than small-scale production and tends inevitably to supplant it, that small peasant farms are being expropriated by big capital, and that the toiling peasantry is being ruined and proletarised.
That is the general law governing the development of agri-culture on capitalist lines, although it may differ in form from country to country.
In his critical remarks on the works of S.
Bulgakov, F.
Hertz, M.
Hecht, E.
David, and K.
Klawki, Lenin refutes the bourgeois reformist theories which extol small farming and assert that it is “superior” to large-scale production.
He exposes the tricks used by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois economists to minimise the earnings of the big farms and exaggerate those of the small.
Lenin counters the false eulo-gies to the “viability” of the small farms—due allegedly to the small farmer’s industry, thrift and hardiness, by showing that small-scale production in agriculture is sus-tained by the back-breaking toil and poor nutrition of the small farmer, the dissipation of his vital forces, the deterio-ration of his livestock, and the waste of the soil’s productive forces.
Lenin has some particularly sharp words for the reformists and revisionists who “fool others by styling themselves socialists”, and put more into prettifying capitalist reality than the bourgeois apologists themselves.
Lenin makes a detailed analysis of E.
David’s Socialism and Agriculture— the main revisionist work on the agrarian question—and shows it to be a collection of bourgeois falsehood and bias wrapped up in “socialist” terminology.
At the same time, Lenin takes pains to sift and examine any genuine scientific data and correct observations andconclusions which he finds in bourgeois sources and writings.
He makes the following extract from O.
Pringsheim’s article: “Modern large-scale agricultural production should be compared with the manufacture (in the Marxian sense)” (see p.
108), and repeatedly makes such comparisons in his works (see present edition, Vol.
5, p.
141 and Vol.
22, p.
99).
On F.
Maurice’s book, Agriculture and the Social Question.
Agricultural and Agrarian France, Lenin makes this remark: “The author has the wildest ideas of the most primitive anarchism.
There are some interesting factual remarks” (see p.
173).
Lenin devotes special attention to an analysis of statis-tics on the agrarian system in Denmark, which the apolo-gists of capitalism liked to present as the “ideal” country of small-scale peasant production.
He exposes the trickery of bourgeois economists and revisionists and demonstrates the capitalist nature of the country’s agrarian system.
The basic fact which bourgeois political economists and revision-ists try to hush up is that the bulk of the land and the livestock in Denmark is in the hands of landowners running farms on capitalist lines (see p.
225 and pp.
376-82).
“The basis of Danish agriculture is large-scale and medium capitalist farming.
All the talk about a ‘peasant country’ and ‘small-scale farming’ is sheer bourgeois apologetics, a distortion of the facts by various titled and untitled ideolo-gists of capital” (see present edition, Vol.

Lenin castigates the “socialists” who try to obscure the fact that production is being concentrated and that the petty producer is being ousted by the big producer, and the fact that the prosperity of capitalist agriculture in Denmark is based on the massive proletarisation of the rural population.
The third part of the volume contains material for a study of the capitalist agriculture of Europe and the United States from 1910 to 1916, including the material relating to Lenin’s New Data on the Laws Governing the Devel-opment of Capitalism in Agriculture.
Part One.
Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America.
In this work, Lenin stresses that the United States, “a leading country of modern capitalism”, was of especial interest for the study of the social and economic structure of agriculture, and of the forms and laws of its developmentin modern capitalist conditions.
“In America, agricultural capitalism is more clear-cut, the division of labour is more crystallised; there are fewer bonds with the Middle Ages, with the soil-bound labourer; ground-rent is not so burden-some; there is less intermixing of commercial agriculture and subsistence farming” (see p.
420).
The important thing is that the United States is unrivalled in the vastness of territory and diversity of relationships, showing the greatest spectrum of shades and forms of capitalist agriculture.
Bourgeois economists, reformists and revisionists distort the facts in an effort to prove that the U.
S.
farm economy is a model of the “non-capitalist evolution” of farming, where the “small family farm” is allegedly supplanting large-scale production, where most farms are “family-labour farms”, etc.
N.
Himmer, who gave his views in an article on the results of the U.
S.
Census of 1910, epitomises those who believe that agriculture in capitalist society develops along non-capitalist lines.
Lenin makes this note: “Himmer as a collection of bourgeois views.
I n t h i s r e s p e c t , his short article is worth volumes” (see p.
408).
The opponents of Marxism based their conclusions on facts and figures, major and minor, which were isolated from “the general context of politico-economic relations”.
On the strength of massive data provided by the U.
S.
censuses, Lenin gives “a complete picture of capitalism in American agriculture” (present edition, Vol.
22, p.
18).
Lenin notes that through their agricultural censuses, bourgeois statisticians collect “an immense wealth of complete information on each enter-prise as a unit” but because of incorrect tabulation and grouping it is reduced in value and spoiled; the net result is meaningless columns of figures, a kind of statistical “game of digits”.
Lenin goes on to work the massive data of agricultural statistics into tables on scientific principles for grouping farms.
The summary table compiled by Lenin (pp.
440-41) is a remarkable example of the use of socio-economic statis-tics as an instrument of social cognition.
He brings out the contradictions and trends in the capitalist development of U.
S.
agriculture through a three-way grouping of farms: by income, that is, the value of the product, by acreage, and by specialisation (principal source of income).
Lenin’s analysis of the great volume of facts and massive agrarian statistics proves that U.
S.
agriculture is developing the capitalist way.
Evidence of this is the general increase in the employment of hired labour, the growth in the num-ber of wage workers, the decline in the number of independent farm owners, the erosion of the middle groups and the consol-idation of the groups at both ends of the farm spectrum, and the growth of big capitalist farms and the displacement of the small.
Lenin says that capitalism in U.
S.
agriculture tends to grow both through the faster development of the large-acreage farms in extensive areas, and through the establishment of farms with much larger operations on smaller tracts in the intensive areas.
There is growing con-centration of production in agriculture, and the expropriation and displacement of small farmers, which means a decline in the proportion of owners.
In his book, Lenin shows the plight of the small and tenant farmers, especially Negroes, who are most ruthlessly oppressed.
“For the ‘emancipated’ Negroes, the American South is a kind of prison where they are hemmed in, isolated and deprived of fresh air” (present edition, Vol.
22, p.
27).
Lenin notes the remarkable similarity between the economic status of the Negroes in America and that of the one-time serfs in the heart of agricultural Russia.
An indicator of the ruin of small farmers in the United States is the growth in the number of mortgaged farms, which “means that the actual control over them is transferred to the capitalists”.
Most farmers who fall into the clutches of finance capital are further impoverished.
“Those who control the banks, directly control one-third of America’s farms, and indirectly dominate the lot” (ibid.
, pp.
92, 100).
Lenin’s study of the general laws governing the capitalist development of agriculture and the forms they assumed in the various countries shed a strong light on the whole process of displacement of small-scale by large-scale pro-duction.
This complex and painful process involves not only the direct expropriation of toiling peasants and farmers by big capital, but also the “ruin of the small farmers and a worsening of conditions on their farms that may go on for years and decades” (Vol.
22, p.
70), a process which may assume a variety of forms, such as the small farmer’soverwork or malnutrition, heavy debt, worse feed and poorer care of livestock, poorer husbandry, technical stag-nation, etc.
Lenin analysed the capitalist agriculture of Europe and the United States decades ago.
Since then, considerable changes have taken place in the agriculture of the capitalist countries.
However, the objective laws governing capitalist development are inexorable.
The development of capitalist agriculture fully bears out the Marxist-Leninist agrarian theory, and its characteristic of classes and the class struggle in the countryside.
The Programme of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union emphasises that the agriculture of the capitalist countries is characterised by a further deepening of the contradictions inherent in the bourgeois system, namely, the growing concentration of production, and ever greater expropriation of small farmers and peasants.
The monopolies have occupied dominant positions in agri-culture as well.
Millions of farmers and peasants are being ruined and driven off the soil.
In the decades since Lenin made his analysis, there have been major changes in the technical equipment of agricul-tural production.
But, as in the time of Marx and Lenin, the machine not only raises the productivity of human labour but also leads to a further aggravation of the contradictions in capitalist agriculture.
The mechanisation of production on the large capitalist farms is accompanied by intensification of labour, worsening of working conditions, displacement of hired labour and growing unemployment.
At the same time, there is increasing ruin of small peasants and farmers, who are unable to buy and make rational use of modern machinery, and who are saddled with debts and taxes; the small and middle farmers who are supplanted by the large farms, become tenants, or wage workers; and the dispossessed tenant farmers are driven off the land.
This is borne out by the massive statis-tics furnished by agricultural censuses in the United States, Canada, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and other capitalist countries.
But in the teeth of these facts present-day bourgeois economists, reformists and revisionists of every stripe keep coming up with the theories long since refuted byMarxism-Leninism and upset by practice itself—asserting that under capitalism the small farm is “stable”, that it offers “advantages” over the large farm, and that under capitalism the toiling peasant can enjoy a life of prosperity.
Modern reformists and revisionists try to revive the old theories of the “non-capitalist evolution of agriculture through the co-operatives.
However, the marketing co-oper-atives extolled by the bourgeoisie and their ‘socialist’ servitors fail to save the small farmers from privation and ruin.
Modern reality fully bears out Lenin’s analysis of co-operatives under capitalism.
Lenin adduced concrete facts on associations for the marketing of dairy produce in a number of capitalist countries to show that these consist mainly of large (capitalist) farms, and that very few small farmers take part in them (see pp.
207, 209-10).
In the capitalist countries today, co-operative societies, which are under the control of banks and monopolies, are also used mainly by capitalist farmers and not by the small farmers.
Lenin’s critique of bourgeois reformist and revisionist views on the agrarian question is just as important today as a brilliant example of the Party approach in science, and of irreconcilable struggle against a hostile ideology, bourgeois apologetics, and modern reformism and revision-ism.
With capitalism plunged in a general crisis, and class contradictions becoming more acute, the bourgeoisie and its ideologists have been trying very hard to win over the peasantry, by resorting to social demagogy, propounding reformist ideas of harmonised class interests, and promising the small farmer better conditions under capitalism.
Lenin s guiding statements on the agrarian question teach the Communist and Workers’ Parties of the capitalist and colonial countries to take correct decisions on the working-class attitude towards the peasantry as an ally in the revo-lutionary struggle against capitalism and colonialism, for democracy and socialism.
Lenin stressed that, in contrast to those bourgeois pundits who sow illusions among the small peasants about the possibility of achieving prosperity under capitalism, the Marxist evaluation of the true position of the peasantry in the capitalist countries “inevitably leads to the recognitionof the small peasantry’s blind alley and hopeless position (hopeless, outside the revolutionary struggle of the prole-tariat against the entire capitalist system)” (present edition, Vol.
5, p.
190).
The historic example of the Soviet Union and other social-ist countries has shown the peasants of the world the advan-tages of the socialist way of farming; they are coming to realise that only the establishment of truly popular power and producers’ co-operatives can rid the peasants of poverty and exploitation, and assure them of a life of prosperity and culture.
The experience of the U.
S.
S.
R.
and the People’s Democracies has toppled the theories spread by the servants of the bourgeoisie which say that the peasantry is basically hostile to socialism.
There is now practical proof of the correctness of the Marxist-Leninist proposition that the peasant economy must and can be remodelled on socialist lines, and that the toiling peasants can be successfully involved in the construction of socialism and communism.
* * * The bulk of the material contained in the present volume was first published from 1932 to 1938, in Lenin Miscellanies XIX, XXXI and XXXII.
Seven writings were first publish-ed in the Fourth Russian edition, among them: remarks on M.
E.
Seignouret’s book, Essays on Social and Agricul-tural Economics; a manuscript containing an analysis of data from the Agricultural Statistics of France; remarks on G.
Fischer’s The Social Importance of Machinery in Agri-culture; a manuscript containing extracts from Hand and Machine Labor; and remarks on E.
Jordi’s Electric Motor in Agriculture.
The publishers have retained Lenin’s arrangement of the material, his marks in the margin and underlinings in the text.
The underlinings are indicated by type variations: a single underlining by italics, a double underlining by s p a c e d i t a l i c s, three lines by heavy Roman type, and four lines by s p a c e d h e a v y R o m a n t y p e.
A wavy underlining is indicated by h e a v y i t a l i c s , if dou-ble—by s p a c e d h e a v y i t a l i c s.
In the Fourth Russian edition the entire text of this volume was verified once again with Lenin’s manuscripts and sources.
All statistical data were checked again, but no correc-tions were made where the totals or percentages do not tally, because they are the result of Lenin’s rounding off the figures from the sources.
The present volume contains footnote references to Lenin’s “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” and New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture.
This has been done to show the connection between the preparatory material and the finished works, and to give an idea of how Lenin made use of his notes.

Theory of rent.
Marx’s theory of value.
Rent can come only from surplus value, that is from surplus profit.
Profit (= surplus value: Capital).
Average profit (K.
Kautsky, 67).
Differential Surplus profit comes from the d i f f e-rences in fertility rent Differential Rent I.
The price of grain is determined by the worst production limited quantity of land growth of market Differential Rent II: additional investment (expenditure) of capital into the land.

)) PLAN OF LECTURE RESUMÉ finale: root of mistakes failed to understand the difficulty our agrarian system resumé RESUMÉ OF LECTURE a) The root of Nevzorov’s mistake is the effort to correct Plekhanov, without having understood him.
The root of the S.
R.
s’ mistake lies deeper: it is a confusion of the democratic and the socialist tasks, of the democratic and the socialist elements, of the democratic and the socialist content of the movement.
This confusion is the result of the entire social nature of the Socialist-Revolutionary movement.
Socialist-Revolutionarism = an attempt on the part of the petty-bourgeois intelligentsia to obscure the working-class movement = radical, revolutionary petty-bourgeois democracy.
Like the liberal democrats, they tend to c o n f u s e the democratic and the socialist tasks, and also to confuse the issue of the autocracy and the question of the agrarian programme.
b) The S.
R.
s and Nevzorov have absolutely failed to understand the difficulty in drawing up an agrarian programme.
Theirs applies to everything, and can be used anywhere, hence: nowhere.
Sd * China and Abyssi-nia.
Sr * Peru and Uruguay.
It is neither a programme nor an agrarian one.
It does not reflect anything; it does not define the m o m e n t (the historical moment: cf.
3 conditions of the programme), it fails to p r o v i d e g u i d a n c e for the present, current struggle.
c) Our agrarian system.
No answer.
Four horizontal strata [big & peasant bourgeoisie 1 2 (6 2 out of 14) & middle peasantry 2 (4 out of 14) & rural semi-proletariat and proletariat 62 millions * These abbreviations have not been deciphered.
—Ed.
(3 2 out of 14) 56 ].
If that were all, there would be no need for an agrarian programme.
But there are also the v e r t i c a l partitions = commune, collective respon-sibility, cut-off lands, labour services, indenture.
It is impossible to liberate the rural semi-proletarian and proletarian for the struggle, without also delivering the rural bourgeoisie of labour services.
d) Resumé of the differences between the S.
R.
and the S.
D.
agrarian programmes: 1) truth (semi-serfdom & class struggle & capitalist evolution) & 2) untruth (mem-ber of a trade union, “colossal organisation of the com-munal peasantry”, balanced extension of socialisation, etc.
).
A policy expounding untruths = a policy of revolution-ary adventurism.

Printed from the originalCRITICAL REMARKS ON THE WORKS OF S.
BULGAKOV AND F.
BENSING Once again Mr.
Bulgakov g a r b l e s a quotation in the grossest manner in Note 2, on p.

The third column of his table does not apply to the “big farms”, as he declares in the heading, but to all farms in general (Unter-suchungen, etc.

The last but one column of Mr.
Bulgakov’s table shows not the percentage of indebtedness of the “medium farms” (as Mr.
Bulgakov says) but the average size of the holding (sic!) in small-scale farming.
(L.
c.
, Anhang, V, S.
575.
) The last column shows not the percentage of indebtedness of the “small farms”, but the average size of holding in large-scale farming (ibidem).
It is incredible, but a fact that Mr.
Bulgakov has managed to confuse the tables of the original he quotes and has “ mixed up ” the data on size of holdings and the data on the percentage of indebtedness.

HERTZ’S BOOK, THE AGRARIAN QUESTIONS IN RELATION TO SOCIALISM * Hertz VI.
Typical approach (lack of historical view, tendency to ramble and delve into detail) Russian translation 17.
1.
K.
Kautsky has “no doubt” impeccably cleared up two questions: on rural labourers on large-scale agriculture Alias—the “peasant question ” .
2.
According to Hertz, K.
Kautsky has two impor-tant points: 1) in agriculture the interests of wage labourers N.
B.
are superior to the interests of the owners.
2) the peasant is an antagonist of the labourer.
3.
In Austria.
82 million active in agriculture.
44 million rural labourers.
Hertz believes that 0.
8 million rural labourers are de facto co-heirs.
4.
“Wortspiel” ** by Kautsky: the peasant-entre-preneur (cf.
Chernov).
5.
The peasant’s alternate transformation (in K.
Kautsky) into a labourer and an entrepreneur.
! * Hertz, F .
, Die agrarischen Fragen im Verhältnis zum Sozialismus.
Wien 1899 .
—Ed .
** Word juggling .
—Ed .
6.
Note 1 5 .
Hertz also regards holders with 1-2 ! {labourers as Kleinbetrieb or peasant farm.
6.
There is no class antagonism between the labour-ers and the small peasants.
7.
Demands must be “immediately attainable”— communal ownership of land (K.
Kautsky) does not meet the requirement.
9.
Not every peasant with subsidiary employment is already a proletarian [v e r y s t u p i d].
“Help” is not exploitation.
10.
“Definition” of capitalism [forgot all about commod-ity production and wage labour!!] 10.
Real definition of capitalism: production under the domination of capital (!! that’s all!!).
“Genetic” definition 10.
Note 25.
“The economic usefulness of the capitalist is still being debated.
” (Sic!) 11.
“Extremely false”—“die” Agrarfrage (!) 11.
Britain: now “a model for everyone”, now “we are not Britain” (con—Bernstein).
12.
“Normal” capitalism.
(?!) The most important thing: the fact that capitalist exploitation is not connected with progress to-wards capitalist large-scale production.
12.
Agriculture in Russia.
Nikolai—on.
12-13.
Large landed estates have not made for progress in Russian agriculture? 13.
New peasantry (according to P.
S.
64) 14.
Also—gilt Nicolai—on (??) * “Nowhere does the new mode of production supplant the old.
” 14.
In Russia, capital does not go on to a juridical possession of the means of production, being satisfied with §§ share of the products.
Socialism will possibly take a similar stand in Sic! respect of capitalism? 15.
Latifundia in Austria are not as common as K.
Kautsky believes (although there are model farms) (and nothing more).
15.
Baudrillart’s excellent works.
(( * Consequently, Nikolai—on remains in force (??) .
—Ed .
16.
The Middle Ages bequeathed a great many pecu-liarities.
K.
Kautsky is t o t a l l y u n h i s t o r i c a l in his summing-up conclusions [Where? What? When?] 17.
Austrian Alps: in 1867 (idem 1 8 8 7 ) the same economy as in the Middle Ages.
18.
Colossal growth of debt.
20.
Hertz agrees with Engels that the peasant must be rescued from “the vegetative life” of the patriar-chal natural economy, but is the money economy the best way? (Sic!) 20-21.
Peasants ruined in the Alps, the rich buying up peasant lands (for hunting).
That is not a case of large-scale production displacing the small.
21.
The transforming effect of capitalism in the Alps is a complete fiasco! 21.
Hence K.
Kautsky is wrong on the educative role (!!) of capitalism: parcel leaseholds are designed to supplant large-scale production altogether.
21.
Accordingly, the “main task of socialism” is to sustain the co-operatives!!! 22.
Concentration of mortgages.
Mortgages are not always 1) large farms owe > than small ones.
24.
Small depositors in mortgage banks.
Cf.
figures.
Enormous % of holders and small % of capital.
26.
Savings banks in Austria.
1’d * 28.
Russian saving banks, 65.
5% workers, etc.
28.
This tendency is not one of centralisation but of decentralisation (!).
29.
Small artisans and workers are expropriating the landowners.
Bernstein is quite right about agri-culture: a growing number of holders (!!!).
31.
Engels’s mistake about America (displacement of small farmers by big ones).
33-34.
In the Eastern United States of America, land prices have dropped, but the progress of agricul-tural production continues, and K.
Kautsky is quite wrong.
[Cf.
Bulgakov II, 435-436].
! * Not deciphered .

!36.
& America: absence of parcels allows the > use of machines.
36.
The Americans take pride in the fact that they do not have such a l o w -s t a n d i n g p e a s -a n t r y a s E u r o p e d o e s.
39.
The modern Grossbetriebe should also be com-pared with the modern Kleinbetriebe Chernov .
40.
There is a terrible waste of labour-power under the parcel economy in Europe: neither the large nor the small farms have any “absolute” supe-riority.
43.
The fatalism of European peasants.
An American would take a limitation of credit worthiness as an affront.
44.
“dire misery” of the European peasant.
45.
Characteristic headline: “ S o c i a l i s t Attacks on Small-Scale Production.
” 47-48.
Countries according to crop yields: Britain, Bel-gium, Denmark, Holland, Sweden, France.
4 countries with small-scale cropping surpass France! in % of farms!! 49.
In large-scale production, the wheat crop is o n l y 0.
49 hectolitre higher.
[Yes, at a rough estimate!] 50.
Growth in crop yields in France in the 19th cen-tury.
51.
Decline in crop yields in Britain.
52.
The growth in the number of agricultural ma-chines in France is evidence (51) that the Kleinbetrieb does not shun science.
52.
Growth in the number of holders (???) 53.
Rural handicraft industry—none in France (we see nothing)?? [Souchon] (Maurice, p.
294).
53.
Distortion.
Parcel farms decline in a r e a (on the question of the growth of wage labour!!) 54.
Hypocritical over “normal” development.
55.
Kautsky’s assertion (about wage labour amongsmall peasants) “total zerfällt” * —data 1862 1882 1892 (Bulgakov) on the decline in the number of day labourers with land.
55.
An exclamation mark over the fact that G r o s s-b e t r i e b is already > 40 hectares! 56.

84-85.
Engels is wrong in expecting overseas competition to intensify.
87.
Kautsky’s “trick” (data on artificial wine).
87-88.
Kautsky’s groundless hopes for the industrialisa-tion of agriculture: the displacement is insignifi-cant.
The merger of agriculture with industries often goes through the co-operatives.
88.
“ IF ” Grossbetrieb has “ really ” combined l a r g e -s c a l e industry and large-scale agricultural production.
(“If”!?!) 88.
1) No concentration.
2) Growing number of independent holders.
3) of all holders.
” ” 4) Superiority of large-scale over small-scale pro-duction is relative.
89.
5) Two trends in development: towards a growth of medium production.
towards parcel farms.
6) P a r c e l l e a s e h o l d s—the ultimate goal of capitalist agriculture.
7) Capitalism fails to create any economic or psychological premises for socialist large-scale production.
8) “The main task of socialism” is to organise !! small-scale production through co-operatives.
89.
The small peasant as well as the small tenant is not a capitalist, but a worker.
89-90.
Labour rent of the small peasant drops to subsist-ence minimum—(!!N.
B.
) 90.
The price of land—the main cause.
91.
The small holder buys land and pays his debts through subsidiary employment ((work for a wage.
.
.
!)).
.
.
92.
The contemporary peasant question is a transmut-N.
B.
ed form of the unemployment problem.
(Hertz fails to make both ends meet).
92.
For Kautsky the agrarian question is everywhere the same.
93.
What will a socialist state do with its employees in agriculture? (Very clever!) KK95.
In agriculture, the lever of economic self-interest (Selbstinteresse) is indispensable.
[Russian trans-lation p.
7.
] !!! socialist! 103.
Terrible nonsense on the content of the modern right of ownership, etc.
104.
—division on the basis of property [pure scholas-ticism!] 105.
—and all of this just to say that it’s no use waiting for a social revolution.
We are in it.
Property will not be transformed “all at once”.
111.
The peasants are “entering socialism”: the co-operatives.
.
.
.
112.
Every year, about 1, 5 0 0 agricultural co-opera-tives arise.
—1 , 0 5 0 , 0 0 0 farmers have united in a purchas-ing society (“con” K.
Kautsky!!).
Kautsky is absolutely wrong.
.
.

In Austria (Hohenbruck) dairy farm co-operatives have less than 1 cow per farmer.

PRINGSHEIM’S ARTICLE, “AGRICULTURAL MANUFACTURE AND ELECTRIFIED AGRICULTURE” 65 Dr.
Otto Pringsheim (in Breslau), “Landwirtschaftliche Manufaktur und elektrische Landwirtschaft”.
[Braun’s Archiv, XV (1900), S.
406-418.
] The author starts by pointing out that he will try to characterise “the forms which agricultural production assumes in the capitalist epoch” (406).
Until now “the question of agrarian morphology” has hardly been dealt with.
(Farms were classified into large and small in a stereotyped way, superficially, only by the area under cul-tivation—407.
) Is there not in agriculture an analogy with the capitalist household industry (the middle link between the handicrafts and large-scale industry)?—In Dutch tobacco-growing, in beetroot production (dependence on the sugar refineries, control over their crops, etc.
—408).
(Consequently: much weaker than in industry—409.
) Let us take a look at a typical specimen of the modern large-scale agricultural enterprise: an East-Elbe estate of 200-400 hectares the prevalence of isolated manual labour and simple co-operation small division of labour not permanent (reapers and binders) permanent (in stock raising).
Machines * ) are used sporadically (as in the industrial manufacture.
Cf.
Das Kapital, I 3 , 335, 349 66 p.
410.
No system of machines (410).
Modern large-scale agricultural production should be c o m p a r e d with the manufacture (in the Marxian sense) (410).
Marketing in agriculture is not so much on a world as on a local scale (411).
And the size of the N.
B.
unit is not big: very few with a turnover of 100,000 marks, whereas in industry this was surpassed long ago (411).
[This indication is very important!] The exception proves the rule [Benkendorf’s estate in Saxony, 2,626 hectares, of which 375 is cultivated by steam plough; livestock—123 draught horses & 70 pairs of oxen & 300 milch cows & 100 fattened bull-calves & 3,600 fattened lambs.

1899, Stück 17 ** )].
**** On the whole, the nature of the large-scale agricultural enterprise is not like that in industry, and it will be easily proved that the middle peasants are not below this level.
But while the Davids and Hertzes, the Oppenheimers and Weisengrüns predicted the early end of large-scale agricul-tural production, there started a technical revolution which should apparently lead to a strengthening of the positions of large-scale agricultural production and take it to a higher stage of development.

CRITICAL REMARKS ON E.
DAVID’S ARTICLE, “THE PEASANT BARBARIANS” David’s short article, “Bäuerliche Barbaren’ (Sozialistische Monatshefte, 1899, No.
2, III.
Jahrgang, S.
62-71) is a typical example of the outrageous approach to the small peasant concept.
David gives a description according to Hecht (Moritz Hecht, Three Villages in the Hard of Baden, Leipzig, 1895) of three villages near Karlsruhe, lying within 4 to 14 kilometres.
In one village (Hagsfeld) the majority are workers who go to work in Karlsruhe, in the second (Blan-kenloch), they are a small minority, and in the third (Fried-richsthal), all are farmers.
They have holdings of 1 to 3 hectares * ) (only one has 9 hectares, and 18—4 to 6 hectares), and lease from 2 to 1 hectare.
Twenty-nine are landless.

6 ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ) Living standard is high (clothes, food, dwellings, etc.
), for instance, consumption of sugar in the three villages is 17 kg per head (only 8.
2 kg for German Reich!), etc.
David is jubilant: There’s your “backward small peas-ants!” he says about these “still really and truly small holders” (p.
66).
This only shows him up as a real and true petty bourgeois, because his is a most eloquent example of the bourgeois village, a visual example of the worthlessness of area statistics.
These are nothing but rich tobacco-plant-ers and suburban peasants—and suburban workers with plots of land! From the outset, E.
David attacks the theory of under-consumption and overwork (62) (“superhuman work and inhuman way of life”).
And, ridiculing orthodox Marxism, etc.
(63), E.
David says: “I should subsequently like to contrast the backward small peasant described by Kautsky with a portrait of the modern small peasant.
In fact, such a type does exist; but he is so different, as man and farmer, from the semi-barbar-ian beggar we find in Kautsky’s book, that anyone wishing to engage in practical land agitation will find it very useful to have a closer look at him as well” (63).
Before that E.
David “retells” Kautsky as follows: Agri-culture has become “one of the most revolutionary, if not the most revolutionary of modern industries”, but small peasant farming is “the most irrational economy one can imagine”.
(No reference to Agrarfrage).
*) 1,825.
60 marks per hectare.
And this holder has 2.
5 hec-tares plus milch cows and pigs (dairy farm near Karlsruhe) (p.
67).
“Let the reader calculate the total income of this (!!) ‘backward small peasant’” (67).
“Comrade Kautsky starts from the premise that small peasant farming cannot be rational at all; that the successes of agricultural science and engineering virtually do not exist for it at all.
Modern machinery, chemical fertilisers, soil improvement, rational crop rotation, improvement of seed and livestock, organisation of marketing and credit— all of this he imagines to be the privilege of capitalist large-scale agriculture from whose table, it is true, some small crumbs do fall to the small peasants, but these are quite insufficient to raise small farming to the economic and technical productivity which is characteristic of large-scale farming” (63).
(A specimen of “vulgarising” Marxism!) Statistics of income from crops: in the south-western states (small farming) it is higher than in East Prussia (large-scale farming).
That the soil is better in the south-west is only a part of the explanation.
Even if the rye ana hay crops in Saxony are lower than in Hessen (the wheat crop is higher), this goes best to show how backward the concept of the general backwardness of peasant farming is (64).
Of course, machines are not as (not equally) accessible to small farming, but 1) machines do not play such a role in agriculture 2) the most important machines are also “accessible” (zugänglich) to small farming.
“Concerning steam and other threshing machines this is admitted even by Kautsky; their application is becoming ever more widespread on the small farms as well.
But Kautsky is wrong when he says that ‘apart from the thresher, the use of machinery in small farming is hardly in evidence’.
“Of the machines included in the count during the 1895 farm census, there is above all the seed drill, which is accessible to a l l, at any rate, to farms of 5 to 20 hectares, !! and smaller farms as well, insofar as they have an even area under crop.
It is true that the percentage of small farms already using it is still insignificant, but if we look at the high, absolute figures and the progress between 1882 and1895, we shall have a positive answer to the question of whether or not they can be used everywhere.
This is borne out by the following survey.
Seeders were used by * : Number of farms: 1882 1895 Under 2 ha 2-5 5-20 20-100 > 100 4,807 4,760 15,980 25,547 22,975 15,320 14,949 13,639 52,003 80,591 61,943 26,931 (214) (551) (3,252) (4,017) (12,091) (12,565) & 10,142 8,879 36,023 55,044 38,968 11,611 (p .
65) “The assertion that apart from the thresher, the use of machinery in small farming is hardly in evidence, is refuted by these figures, for the seed drill, at any rate.
” and in the note there is a reference to The Condition of the Peasants, I, 106, to the effect that in the Weimar district, the “seed drill is common among the richer (!!) and is already making its way into the 30-or 40-acre farms”.
Let’s note that 28.
5 ha = 100 Weimar acres about 9.
5 ha = 30 -40 ” ” “Nor can it be said that the reaper is absolutely beyond the reach of small farming.
In 1895, it was already in use on 6,746 farms of 5 to 20 ha” (p.
65).
Then comes a quotation from a Frankfort-on-the Main factory catalogue: 20-25-30-60 pfennigs for 2 day’s use of a machine: seeder (60 pfennigs), harrow (25 pfennigs), etc.
“But the other achievements of modern agriculture have penetrated into small peasant farming to a much greater extent than the machines.
To give a visual picture of this I shall quote in somewhat greater detail one of the most fundamental (! ! ! ) and interesting (!) monographs on the condition of the peasantry which have appeared in the recent period” .

H e c h t (66) ** in these three villages: “Holdings everywhere are small and dwarf peasant farms” (E.
David’s italics).
] ^ * Under the 1882 census, the count only dealt with seeders; and in 1895 broadcast sowers and seed drills were classified under separate heads.
Con-sequently, the 1882 figures should be compared with the total number of machines of both types in 1895; the relatively smaller number of farms using the broadcast sowers, the less important type, is given in brackets after the total figure (E .
David’s note) .

“What has been said must cast doubt on Kautsky’s asser-tion which is presented to us as a generally recognised truth: ‘that in contrast to large-scale farming peasant farming rests not on a higher productivity but on more modest requirements’” (68).
For all labour-intensive crops, small farming is undoubtedly more rational (68).

In defiance of Kautsky’s prophecies! In fact, they are having it very well indeed, and any cash surplus—and they often have one—is instantly deposited in savings ! banks to earn interest” (68).
“I have quoted this study, based as it is on serious data, at such length because it gives an excellent characteristic of every aspect of the most modern type of West-German small peasantry’ (70) .

“For it should not be imagined that Hecht’s facts are exceptional cases, without any importance for the general condition and the future of small-scale farming” (70) In Mombach (near Mainz), where E.
David lives, the peasants are no worse off than the Hard peasants.
They raise lettuce, asparagus, peas, etc.
E.
David objects to Kautsky’s taking “a few pictures of poverty” from the Rhön mountains, Spessart, upper Taunus, etc.
, and drawing general conclusions (71).
His, David’s, picture will help to find a general correct average (71) (my italics).
The condition of the peasants is now on the whole better than before.

44 ha 68“The little man” (in Friedrichsthal) obtains 30 kilo-grammes of tobacco from 4 Morgen (9 ares)—“the rich one” (with 3-3 2 hectares)—only 25 kilogrammes.
The poor one is more diligent (p.
71).
Twenty-four years ago one had 110 ares.
Now he has 3 2 hectares—made additional purchases.
And all that ! due only to being “fiercely industrious” (71).
“There are many more such examples.
” Then there is also the “sober marriage policy”.
The well-known peasant saying: “We work not so much for our mouth as for our pockets” (71).
Hagsfeld—the cause of progress is not only the entry into market relations, not only the free division of land, but also education in the spirit of a higher morality, endeavour and self-help (7 1).
The virtues: diligence, thrift, temperance, which now mark the Hard peasant, are not innate but acquired (72).
And Hecht extols education by state, church, and school: in the sweat of your face shall you eat bread! Why does one get 4 centners of tobacco from 9 ares, and the other, 1? Why does one raise tobacco and the other rye? Lasiness.
Why do neighbours (say, in the Bruchsal district) live worse, despite similar market conditions?—In our opinion the major cause of the better economic condition of our 3 villages is the more pronounced existence and development of moral factors.
But the education of the Hard peasant is revealed not only in his greater industry, hardiness, the truly remarkable thrift and temperance (73)—but also in self-help.

224,000 marks is, of course, n o t a l l ; taking the round figure of 258,000 marks, this gives 1,000 marks per hectare and 1,800 marks for 1.
8 hectares.
The peasant of the 18th century, with his eight to ten hectares of land, was a peasant and a manual labourer; the dwarf peasant of the 19th century, with his one or two hectares of land, is a brainworker, an entrepreneur, and a merchant (p.
69).

5, p .

Concluding words: The dwarf peasant and the factory worker have both raised themselves to the position of the middle class.
.

.
“The three villages in the Hard of Baden” now belong to one great, broad middle class (94).

50 ” farming Q Q drainage Q ! ! The author says that he tried to find a village with a “possibly uniform soil” (p.
1), but does not give any soil classification for I and II.
Both farms are among the best in the area (p.
1).
Cultivation of land—see s e p a r a t e s h e e t .
* In I, cows are used in ploughing and on working days (105) receive more feed.
On hot summer days, they are overworked (p.
9), but then the owner gives them more fodder beet.
Drai-nage in I— 4 8 0 marks (3% = 14.

table**! The same value of the product is taken.
There are no facts.
On the small farms, the cattle are given better care: “The cattle fatten under the owner’s eye” (p.
27).

In I and I, the same system and character of farming.
Not so livestock farming.
In II, the cattle are fattened for slaughter and are not bred, and in I, each head of cattle has been raised on the farm (p.
28).
It is very, very common for the big peasant to buy lean cattle from the small peasant and fatten them N.
B.
up—all over Germany (p.
28): small farming has advantages over big farming in the raising of cattle (p.
29).
Maintenance of structures—the small peasant mostly repairs everything himself (p.
30).
In II dead stock is on a very high level (machines), but I is not backward (p.
31), for the small peasant makes do (!!) just as well with simpler implements.
Depreciation in I—2%, in II—6%.
II has had a P cart for 10-12 years; I has farmed years N after his father, and has not bought a cart, and M ! does not remember h i s f a t h e r b u y i n g N o n e e i t h e r , and he had farmed for 30 years.
Q Small implements are used on small farms to the utmost (31).
II spends 3,872.
93 marks on hired labour= 36.
53 per Morgen, while the small peasant econ-omises on all this, because he is both m a s t e r and l a b o u r e r (p.
3 3, t o o w o r d y).
That is the tremendous advantage of small farming!!! Small farming—dearth of land.
The buyer of a small holding is usually very well aware that it would be better for him, finan-cially speaking, to work for a daily wage and in addition to receive an income in the form of interest on his capital.
But he rejects this higher profit for the sake of greater convenience (33).
.
.
.
In the coal area of Saarbrücken “these small hold-ers make up the best nucleus of the mine workers” !! (33)—as the author was told by a factory manager at Neunkirchen, and, contrary to S o c i a l -D e m o -cratic agitation , Auhagen believes:P “The best thing the state could do in this area M to solve the labour problem is to help workers to Q acquire small plots of land, by granting credits” (33).
Advantage of I: “He (the small peasant) fre-quently has the assistance of his children about ! the farm almost as soon as they learn to run” (34)! Pp .
3 9 -4 0 —an example of the thriftiness of the small peasant (cited by Kautsky): a wife wore out one pair of shoes in 17 years of married life, etc.
, etc.
Why I has higher crop yields 1) more thorough working of the fields—work themselves; “The ordinary day labourer, especially on the big farms, thinks as he works: ‘I wish the holi-day would come round sooner’; whereas the N.
B.
small peasant, in doing all kinds of urgent work anyway, hopes, ‘I wish I could have another couple of hours today’” (p.
42).
2) I does his work in time: he has more labour per hectare.
The small peasant can g e t u p e a r l i e r a n d g o t o b e d l a t e (43) when time is very short.
3) I is not afraid of work: beetles were collected by hand.
4) I takes in his crop faster, the grain has no time to drop.
5) I has better seed material: it is, picked by hand in winter (no grain-sorter!).
6) I uses more fertilisers, because he has more cattle (n o f i g u r e s).
Sale I = 3,400.
80 —735.
31 per hectare II = 14,097.
41 —531.
98 per hectare The net income is also higher (see table of per cent on c a p i t a l * ).
Auhagen himself is aware that the living stand-ards are different (p.
49) and excludes housekeep-ing (s e e t a b l e ** ) ! * See p .
131 .
—Ed .
** See pp .
130-31 .
—Ed .
—but what I should like to point out, as a phenom-P enon common for the whole of Germany, is the higher rent on small peasant farms as compared M Sic! with the big peasant farms and landed estates (49) Q that is why land fetches more under small farming.
Fragmentation of estates .
.
.
leads to .
.
.
an increase in the value of the n a t i o n a l p r o p e r t y (50) Auhagen admits that the small peasants are more liable to have backward systems of farming (51).
These are impossible among big peasants: they can hold on only by improving.
But progress comes not only from the big farm, but also from the well-to-do owner (!).
Remarks on various parts of Germany (cursorily on the ad-vantages of different-size farms in different areas).
“Ausgebaute” (those who settle on separate farmsteads outside the village) mostly run their farms better (54-55); there is more routine in the village.

“Big farms use an average of 4 of their gross income in their own economy, medium farms, about 3 , and small, roughly 2 .
Nevertheless, the share remain-ing on the small farms for marketing is greater than those on big and medium farms.
The reason is above all that small peasants tend to limit their household expenses to the utmost.
W e c a n n o t d e c i d e o u t r i g h t w h e t h e r or not this partially results in some under-c o n s u m p t i o n , because the available material does not enable us to draw the correct conclusions on the overall household budget of the farmer and his family.

Part of the small peasants also diligently work as day labourers, and on such days receive from their employers board, in addition to their pay.

Whether there is any under-consumption among the small farms or not, we cannot say, but we think it is probable in the case of a small farm falling into Group IV.
But the fact is that the small peasants live very frugally and sell much of what they, so to speak, save out of their mouths.
(Sic!) P.
479: If we find in the final analysis that it is the medium farm that can produce a certain quantity of products at the lowest cost, we must take into account that the small farm may assess all its labour-power at a correspondingly lower figure than that used on the large and medium farms, because it is its own.
In time of agricultural crisis, and even at other times, it is the small farms that are most stable; they are able to sell a relatively larger quantity of products than the other categories of farms by severely curtailing domes-tic expenses, which, it is true, must lead to a certain amount of under-consumption.

Disregarding the flax crop, which is on the whole of small importance at the present time, we have the highest yields on the big farms, and the lowest, on the small (441).
Causes: On the big farms the soil is fertilised with marl 1) Drainage is almost entirely absent on the small farms.
Or the pipes are laid by the farmers themselves, and laid badly.
2) Ploughing is not deep enough—horses are weak.
(Yoking of cows is doubtful.
Doing heavy work, the cows will yield little milk.
) 3) Mostly insufficiellt feed for cattle—horned cattle 4) Their manure production is inferior—their straw is shorter, most of it goes into feed, and less remains for litter (Unterstreuen).

(442).
Those are above all the four causes for which small farms now lag in terms of income behind the big farms.
Klawki then goes on to say that, in agriculture, machines are not all that important (common arguments.
Not a single fact).

(Characteristic “exchange of good turns”!) * Agriculture suffers from unfavourable marketing condi-tions.
The peasants mostly sell “locally” and merchants in small towns force down prices very considerably (373).
The large estates are better off in this respect, for they can send considerable quantities of their products to the provincial capitals right away.
This usually gives them 20 to 30 pfennigs more per centner than selling in small towns.

But Klawki took the same prices for all (373).
The big landowners alone have exact book-keeping (374).
Only as an exception among the peasants.
There are no technical agricultural enterprises.
“Peat extraction is primarily of great importance to the small farms, because they have the necessary time and manpower for it” (439).
Flax growing has remained only among the small farmers: it requires a great expenditure of human energy.
It is avail-able in the families of the small holders, but the big farm-ers find hire hard and costly (440).

The big farmers I process their milk into butter: “their own very profitable use of milk”.
The big farms II-IV send their milk to the towns and obtain a higher income than the middle farmers, who process their milk into butter at home and sell it to traders.
The middle farmers concentrate on the sale of well-fattened cattle.
The small farmers sell their cattle younger—they cannot feed them as long as the middle farmers because they are short of feed (444).
The butter produced on the medium farms (Klawki always calls them big peasant farms) is s u p e r i o r to that produced on the small farms (separators, daily churning), so that the latter are paid 5-10 pfennigs less per pound by the traders.

(about 2 of all receipts) 1 ) In general, the drop in prices leads to a displacement of crop farming by livestock farming.
The reason why small farms are superior in crop farming: the big farms spend more on the production of feed and the feeding of stock (Klawki excludes the feeding of stock from receipts (p.
441) from agriculture: this, he says, applies to livestock farming).
The small farms keep many more animals per Morgen, although their cattle are, of course, not as valuable (446), and their horses are worse (447).
The stock on the medium farms is not worse than that on the big farms.
2 ) Medium farms use relatively much on the farm; for the big farms—marketing is profitable; on the small farms, butter and whole milk are used in very small quantities.

not used at all on the small farms of Group IV (450).

479) In giving these 2 tables, Klawki says: Both these tables most clearly show the great importance of the farmer’s and his family’s own labour-power.
If we find in the final analysis that it is the medium farm that can produce a certain quantity of products at the lowest cost, we must take into account that the small farm may assess all its labour at a correspondingly lower figure than that used on the large and medium farms, because it is its own.
In time of agricultural crisis, and even at other times, it is the small farms that are most stable; they are able to sell a relatively larger quantity of products than the other categories of farms by severely curtailing domestic expenses, which, it is true, must lead to a certain amount of under-consumption.
This, as we have seen, is already taking place on the small farms of Group IV.
Unfortu-nately, many small farms are reduced to this by the high rates of interest on loans.
But in this way, although with *) Our peasant farms spend nothing on Kraftfuttermittel.
They are very slow to adopt progressive methods and are particularly chary of spending cash (461).
* * See present edition, Vol .

—Ed .
great effort, they are able to stay on their feet and live !! from hand to mouth.
Probably, it is the great diminution in consumption that chiefly explains the increase in the number of small-peasant farms in our locality, as indicated ! in the Reich statistics (cf.
table on p.
372).
(480).
* In the Königsberg Administrative Area (p.

But there is progress even among the small farms: everything is for the best.
The advantage of the big farmer—that he sells in carloads, etc.
, which is much more profitable, and he is better able to assess the value of his grain (451).
The same goes for cattle.
The big farmer sells his corn in centners, and his cattle by weight.
The peasant sells his grain by measure (Scheffel), and cattle by appearance, which makes him lose a great deal.
*** The small peasants do all the repairs of buildings (etc.
) themselves.
Medium farms III and IV and small farms lay their own drainage pipes.
(Drainage is necessary in the locality, and there is an ever greater demand for pipes).
P.
460: most of them (farms) began using fertilisers by way of experiment.

Further-more, we must take into account that the larger the farm, the greater is, as a rule, the quantity of additional food products purchased (453).
* The medium farm consumes very much, surpassing the “average rational nutrition standard”.
It is interesting how Klawki makes an (absurd) attempt to smooth out this difference: Let us assume, however, that the small farms are able to secure a higher cash income only by some under-consump-tion.
To smooth out this fact, let us take the cost of consump-tion per person as 170 marks a year (?? why not 218-227?), an amount which should be regarded as being exaggerated rather than minimised, if we take into account the fact that the estimate includes food products coming only from the home farm itself.
If on the strength of the figures *) The food of the menials and, for example, flax, have been deducted from natural consumption.
The other amounts are divided per head.
* See present edition, Vol .
5, p .
176 .
—Ed .
in the given table we assume that the small farm has an average size of 20-25 Morgen, and that the number of family members engaged in farming is 4, consumption would come to an average of 135 marks per person.
Comparing with this figure the hypothetical consumption of 170 marks per person, we get & 35 marks, and with 4 persons, 140 marks.
Dividing that by 20-25 Morgen, the figure comes to 6-7 marks per Morgen.
This means that for this purpose the market would have to be deprived of produce worth that much.
Thus, the small farm would be receiving only 29-30 marks of net income per Morgen, and would then be equalised with the medium farm; but it would still have an edge over the big farm.
* Let us take not 170 but 218 marks—135= 83; 4&5& 3&5= 17; 17 ÷ 4= 4 4 ; 83 9 4.

464: The small farms have the greatest capacity for resistance.
The small farmer can assess the .

.
labour-power used .
.
.
at a correspondingly lower price, because that is his own labour, whereas the big peasant and the landowner depend on the general conditions of wages and must more or less reckon with the demands of the labourers.
The small farmer is also more capable than the big one, and above all than the landowner, to reduce the portion going into the manage-ment of his enterprise, the entrepreneur’s profit, because at critical moments he is able to restrict himself severely (sic!) in his housekeeping.
This is the small farm’s advantage in a crisis.

In peasant households, the labourers are certainly better fed than by the landowners (467).
* The labourers cost more but produce more.

” ” If the Scharwerker are the Instmann’s children, his family income = 800-900 marks (p .
475) If the Scharwerker are the Deputant’s children, his family income = 600-700 marks (number of family members not given anywhere!) Thus, it is not for the sake of higher wages that the Inst-mann is more willing to work for the peasant owner.
The reason: the author says, it gives him more spare time, so he can do day labour (!?) (p.
476).
When lucky, such Instleute purchase a few Morgen of land out of their savings (from wages).
For the most part they find themselves worse off financially; they are aware of this but are tempted by the greater freedom (476).
Many— not the worst, by far—go to the towns.
The most important task of modern agrarian policy for the solution of the agricultural labourer problem in the East is to encourage the most efficient labourers to settle down by affording them the opportunity of acquiring a piece of land as their own property, if not in the first, then at least in the second generation (476).
** On p.
477, Klawki declares that the peasant finds it easier to obtain labourers.
But the labourer problem is being aggravated even for the peasant.
The peasants complain of the difficulty of obtaining labourers, especially labouring women.

Klawki’s data are highly inadequate: very many gaps.
For instance, there are no data at all on feed.
The total crop is not classified by requirements: sowing, feed, con-sumption, sales.
It is hardly possible to fill in these gaps.
Thus, big farm I.

92Since K.
Klawki gives the marketed products and those consumed on the farm in cash terms only, it would be necessary to 1) determine the gross crop by multi-plying each number of Morgen for the types of cereals by the average crop; 2) subtract the sowing; 3) multiply the difference by average prices (and these prices are not given for all the products); 4) subtract the marketed products, etc.
Furthermore, since the quantity of livestock has not been reduced to a single unit, it is quite impos-sible anyway to determine in figures how well the cattle is fed.
Consequently, such calculations are useless.

“Untersuchungen über den Einfluss der Verschuldung ländlicher Besitztümer auf deren Bewirt-schaftung” (S.
253-310).
A study was made of landed estates (17) and peasant farms (34) “in one district of the Liegnitz Administrative Area” (Lower Silesia).
The author gives a list of all these estates, but without any summing up.
17 landowners, each with 75-924 ha (9 with 200-500 ha; 1 has under 100 ha, namely 75; 1 with 127 ha; 1 with 924; 1 with 819).
For each estate he gives only the number of ha (and categories of land), quantity of livestock, assessed value and debt (“according to an 1896 study”).
Two of the 17 have no debt at all (204 and 333 ha); two with over 100% of the value (105 and 104%); 1—90-100%; 2—70-80%; 2—60-70%; 1—50-60%; 3—80-90%; 2—40-50%; 1—30-40% .
Among the peasants, 5 are free from debt.

262-63).
Detailed description of the farms (landed estates are marked in small Latin letters: a-r) a) 205 ha.
Excellent estate: (8 horses & 14 oxen & 106 head of big horned cattle) the “pearl” of the district.
(Debt = 87% of value).
Very high crop yields, high culture.
“The soil was only gradually brought up to this state by systematic drainage, abundant fertilisation, deep turning up and care for the ploughland by means of neat and timely cultivation, and drill and row crops” (p.
264).
All the structures are massive—“a vast amount of capital is invested here”.
‘The livestock is highly fattened, all, without exception.
” All types of machinery.
The crop-rotation system is ration-al, the fertilisation is very heavy (manure and artificial fertilisers).
“The erection of costly structures swallows up all the rent.
” b) 301 ha; debt—46.
3%.
The soil has been improved by many years’ cultivation, cleared of stones, etc.
, a great quantity of lime has been added.
The structures are all good, all massive, cost 170,000 Mk.
All the livestock (10 horses & 26 oxen & 100 head of big horned cattle & 400 sheep) is fed and kept rationally.
All types of machines (no enumeration).
Fertilisers well stored.
Artificial fertilisers bought.
Ploughing 17-20 cm (beetroot: 30-35 cm).

Peasant farms are not listed separately.
“The big and middle peasants as a rule farm better, more intensively, than the small peasants, the big vegetable gardeners (Grossgärtner) and owners of dwarf plots” (292): deeper ploughing (cows weak) row tillage artificial fertilisers and feed purchased.
“If, finally, the crop yields of the peasant farms lag behind those of most landed estates, this is due above all to the peculiarity of small and medium land holdings.
The peasant ploughs 5 or 8 cm shallower, in an effort to spare his young horses, which he wants to sell at a profit.
In general, he knows how to take care of his livestock much better than hired farm-hands usually do.
He cannot have special imple-ments for each separate purpose, improve cultivation methods endlessly, stage long experiments in tillage and the use of fertilisers, and many other things” (292).
The peasant tries to improve his farming methods by introducing artificial fertilisers and purchasing feed, and machinery.
“The peasant has long since realised the importance of deep ploughing and timely cultivation, the need for correct selection of valuable sorts of seeds for sowing, the keeping of stall manure, and many other similar things.
Where he fails to eliminate the shortcomings which can be righted, thereby acting against his own convictions, or is forced to do so, he is, as a rule, short of capital to do this” (293).
The structures are “almost everywhere” massive and in good repair.
The livestock is well fed.
This is the first group of peasant farms, 1 (south of a Kreis-stadt (district town)) out of 34 (No.
1-11 and No.
18) No.
18 = 110 ha The second group consists of (to the north) out of 34 (of these 22: 4 with 10-20 ha; 11, with 20-50 ha; 7 with 50-95 ha).
The land is damp sand, which suffers from stag-nant moisture.
Ploughing 10-13 cm.
“A primitive wooden plough is pulled by a small overworked horse or weak half-starved team of cows” (296).
Too much ploughed under for cereal grains.
.
.
short straw, thin stalks, empty ears and flat grains.
.
.
.
They usually keep more cattle than the scanty stocks of feed warrant.
There is frequently a shortage of feed and litter.
.
.
.
In winter, this quantity of cattle N.
B.
somehow survives on straw, chaff, glume, and small quantities of roots and putrid hay.
Feedis short at all times, and is of poor quality; in some parts, the drinking water, with a high iron-content, is harmful for the animals.
In consequence, the cattle are small, lean, with coarse wool, or simply grow sickly and starve in small dark sheds.
That is why one cannot expect them to be used correctly, or expect great quantities of good manure.
“Fertilisers are produced for each crop, but i n homeopathic d o s e s .
It is impossible .
.
.
to make up for this poor and inadequate fertiliser by purchases of kainite.
It is not fair to expect a sick man to be efficient.
Alongside the lack of means, there is lack of management and experience.
The peasant never uses lime, and green fertiliser only in separate cases.
.
.
(297).
The cultivation of the fields is hopelessly primitive but still burdensome; the collected manure is scattered, q or w of the seeds is sown by hand, then the field is ploughed, and then the other 3 or 4 is sown on the surface and harrowed with a home-made harrow.
Rye is sown occasionally, from time to time, because of the lack of fertiliser.
It would, of course, be better to change the seeds, but that and much else is not done because of the shortage of capital.
The peasant avoids anything that costs money, as a matter of principle, if he wishes to last.
He continues to thresh his grain the old way, with a flail, either picking by hand or sifting all the rubbish.
Recently, some holders who are better off bought themselves a small horse-driven thresher.
The straw is used mostly as feed, whereas it would do better (predom-inantly) as litter for the animals.
Furthermore, there is need to chop up hay and straw for feed, to cover the potato and beet stores with straw, mend the holes in the thatch, and mix some hay with the straw to make it last as long as possible, so that when the straw crop is poor, nothing or very little remains for litter.
It so happens that the use of forest leaves becomes the general rule.
No more chopped straw goes into litter, but only conifer which is collected in the forest every year.
Theupshot is that the few pines growing on the denuded sand go to seed, and that, despite the vast forests, there is a shortage of timber for building, once the dilapidated structures, repaired innumerable times, threaten to collapse altogether.
Even the holders with more money at their disposal are in no posi-tion to erect new structures.
There is lack of stone, gravel, clay, timber, and above all, money.
.
.
.
Everything is in short supply.
The unfortunate farmer of these sad parts labours and toils with his often numerous family from dawn to dusk, day in, day out; his toil-hardened hands and lean face are a sign of nothing but unceasing hard work.
He strug-gles for his unenviable existence, fights misfortune and care, and barely manages to keep body and soul together; he strains his every fibre to obtain some money, before it is too late, to pay off the urgent interest and taxes, but fears that he may be ruined anyway.
He has no means for any radical improve-ments; but the fact is that they alone could help him and make his naturally poor scrap of land solidly productive and capable of giving better sustenance to its owner” (298) —the only happy exception among these 22 holdings in the second group is the estate of the village headman at R.
(No.
18: 110 ha, 43 head of big horned cattle, 4 pigs & 6 horses, a debt of 5 0.
3 per cent; only three of these 22 peasants have a higher debt percentage than this).
On average, the master of R.
takes in 2-3 times more grain, 3-4 times more potatoes, 6-8 times more beetroot than all the other holders in R.
, who farm the old way, and who, because of their debts, have no opportunity or reason to farm any other way.
The master of R.
raises crops which his neighbours are unable to introduce successfully into their crop rotation, because their soil lacks the necessary cultivation and manuring.
.
.
.
He (the master of R.
) paid for his estate in cash, and has c a p i t a l at his disposal.
It is capital and labour that have yielded such excellent results.
No peasant could have created “an oasis in a desert” if he had no financial support, as a prerequisite to back up his efforts (300).
He has “dry sand” which is being gradually brought into cultivation (green fertiliser).
He uses kainite, etc.

In the Ergebnisse, there are the most d e t a i l e d, incredibly detailed, budgets (70), the main results of which are given in the table I have borrowed.

(p.

The above-given statistics, consequently, confirm the widespread opinion that those owners of peas-ant holdings, who are on the borderline [in the middle] between the day labourers and the middle peasants [in the rural districts the farmers of this category are usually called the “middle estate”— Mittelstand], are frequently in a worse position than those in the groups above and below in size of holdings; for, although they are able to cope with moderate indebtedness, if it is kept at a certain and not very high level, they find it difficult to meet their obligations, being unable to obtain regular collateral employment (as day labourers, etc.
), by which means to increase their income.
* They can meet their obligations only when their children have grown up and are placed, so that family expenses are less of a burden on these small farms.
By contrast, day labourers (or handicraftsmen) with small holdings, insofar as they have some regular collateral employment, are frequently in * See present edition, Vol .
5, pp .
187-88 .
—Ed .
a much better position materially than those belong-ing to the “middle estate”, for, as computations in numerous cases have shown, collateral employ-N.
B.
ment at times yields such a high net (i.
e.
, money) income as to enable them to repay even large debts * ; this explains the frequently observed fact that where such conditions obtain, small holders, like day labourers and others, gradually manage to take small-peasant holdings out of debt.
These computations also show that it is the rural owners, who belong to the lowest sections of the independent peasant population, that have most reasons to make cautious use of their credit, which is why they have to make an especially careful review of their financial possibilities when buying any real estate (pp.
66-67).
Data for communities also prevail on the question of indebtedness.
Cf.
especially p.
97: “The final conclusion [on the question of indebtedness]: relatively less favourable position of the small-peasant population.
” The study of indebtedness by groups of holdings has shown: Almost everywhere .
.
.
it has turned out that it is the lowest groups of holders (day labourers with a land allot-ment) that have the highest percentage of indebtedness, and that, on the contrary, this proportion markedly declines for the peasant population proper, and in general tends to drop with the growth of the estates in size, sometimes very rapidly indeed, frequently disappearing almost entirely in the higher groups (big-peasant holdings) (p.
89).
In the final count, the studies of debt levels in the commu-nities concerned give the following picture on the strength of these data: Almost everywhere, there is a very considerable debt burden on the holdings of day labourers.
Nevertheless, this part of the debt is the least dangerous (p.
97)—for this section of the rural population relies mainly on earnings not from the land, and experience shows that, given regular earnings (“to any extent”), day labourers manage to cope * See present edition, Vol .
5, p .
188 .
—Ed .
[ ]with their debts (which mostly arise from the purchase of land).
The debt on holdings among middle and big peasants in the overwhelming majority of the communities studied, even in those which are considered heavily in debt, remains within the limits marked out by the size of estates, and such debt is very small in a rather large number of communi-ties, to be found in all economic areas.
.
.
.
On the other hand, in a considerable number of the communities studied, the indebtedness of the small-peasant population is relatively larger and not entirely safe, considering the permissible limit of indebtedness, and in view of the fact that this higher indebtedness should ultimately be due largely to definite external conditions.
.
.
(p.
97) (land, climate, land hunger, etc.
), the same thing may be assumed for the country’s other communities.
This indebtedness is the result mainly of credit for land (purchase of land and transfer of estates).
.
.
.
in purchasing land, particular business-like caution must be exercised—something to which most study reports point—primarily by the small-N.
B.
peasant population and by the day labourers, ranking next to it (p.
98).
The small peasant sells relatively little for cash, but he stands particularly in need of money, and .
.
.
because of his lack of capital, he is especially hard hit by every murrain, hailstorm, etc.

Then (N.

Hence, the concentration of machinery should be even greater.

That is why classification by area is not enough.
There Of course, the concentration of dairy farming does not at all have to coincide with f a r m s producing the bulk of the marketed dairy products.
Consequently, the concentration of dairy farming is enormous, with l a r g e c a p i t a l i s tcropping.
a clear indication that dairy and livestock farming is s p e c i a l i s i n g away from 2 ha, we find that the first subgroup has many more cows p e r f a r m than the second; of farms into two subgroups: those with under 50 ares, and those with from 50 ares to 574 cows (11.

Needless to say, the proportion of the big farms here has been understated, for the value of the livestock has been assumed to be the same everywhere, whereas livestock on the big farms is, of course, better, and fetches a higher price, so that the ratio between the groups could also be brought out incorrectly (improvement of livestock on the big farms).
But the total number of livestock did, of course, increase less than on the small.
The big farms lost most from the great decline in commer-cial sheep-breeding, and the more considerable (as compared with the small farms) increase in their raising of horned cattle and pigs only made up some, but not all of their loss.
The following ratio for converting livestock into big cattle is given on p.
54 of the book, Die deutsche Volkswirt-schaft am Schlusse des 19.
Jahrhunderts*: “1 c o w = 1 0 p i g s = 1 0 s h e e p.

9I 3,241 1,445 8,045 3,010 1,374 8,064 III C 4 (agricultural labourers without land)In studying the changes in occupations, the following must be adopted as a basis: 1) agriculture proper: A1, and not A1-6 (Mr.
Bulgakov, II, 133, takes precisely these A1-6, thereby obtaining a & number of gainfully employed population, i.
e.
, adds to agriculture truck gardening, forestry and fishery, which is clearly wrong) 2) main occupation, i.
e.
, persons for whom agriculture is the main occupation.
Data on subsidiary employment are highly indefinite in the sense that they fail to show the importance of the subsidiary employment, etc.
Conclusions: 1.
Bulgakov is quite wrong in saying that there is an increase in the quantity of agricultural labour.
In the main occupation it has d e c r e a s e d .
We cannot judge how far this is offset by an increase of agricultural labour in subsidiary employment.
2.
Changes in the distribution of occupations (main occu-pation) show: a) a growth of expropriation: the total number of land-holders (owners, leaseholders and labourers) had d r o p p e d by 250,000.
The number of owners has increased by 233,000, and the number of labourers with land has decreased by 483,000, Consequently, it was the p o o r e s t section of the farmers that was expropriated.
The number of labourers used the capitalist way increased by 231,000 (&7.
7 %, i.
e.
, a greater increase than that in the number of owners, which was 5.
6%).
Consequently, agriculture developed precisely and spe-cifically the capitalist way.
[Let us note that it is quite wrong to include working members of farmer families (C 1) among hired labourers—as statistics, and Mr.
Bulgakov, II, 133 along with it, do.
C 1—co-owners, and C 2-C 4—hired labourers.
Therefore, when determining the capitalist application of labour, C 1 should be added to A.
]As for C 3, it is, of course, an intermediate category: on the one hand, they are hired labourers, and on the other, holders.
And it is this intermediate category that has been eroded most in 13 years.

This column sometimes gives an amount in excess of the total because I summed up the number of farms keeping 1 (2 and so on) men and women farm-hands, where-as there are some farms which keep both.
Unfortunately, the total number of farms using hired labour i s n o t g i v e n.
This means that what can be summed up is only either the number of cases of labour hire or the number of hired labourers (by multiplying by 1, by 2, by 3, etc.
).
Farming by “labourers” (1-2 ha) appears to be typical for all the communities.

Four big volumes (The Hague, 1890).
Descriptions by communities are on the lines of the Ba-den and other inquiries (but almost without budgets).
Of special interest are the tables on many communities show-ing the distribution of farms among labourers, “carters”, small peasants, and big peasants—(in Community No.
1, Laren, labourers usually have 1-2 ha; “carters”, 2-10 ha; small peasants, 10-20 ha and big peasants, 30-40 ha; p.
7, Vol.
I).
Here are some of the heads in the table: 1) Getal = number of farms by size; 2) “state and location of land established with the participation of a definite number of farmers” (the location of the land .
.
.
on the farms is ad-vantageous, middling, bad);—“gebruikte Mest” (use of fertilisers: manure, artificial fertilisers—by number of farms).
—Number of horses and livestock of all categories.
— Number of farms making butter and cheese (Zuivelboeren = peasants engaged in dairy farming).
Number of farms using “old” (alt) and “new” methods of “dairy farming”.
Number of farms keeping “farm-hands” and “labourers” under three heads: 1 each, 2 each, “3 and more each”.
In the summing up in Vol.
IV, there are summaries for some few data relating to the communities, but there is not N.
B.
a single summary for all the communities together (a total of 9 5 communities were studied).
PP There are different classifications by groups: 1) labour-small peasants, big peasants; 2) land area 1-5 ha, etc.
, NN ers, 60-70 ha, 70 ha and over, etc.
; 3) horses (Community MM No.
92: small peasants—with one horse; peasants, with 2 NN horses; big peasants, with 3 or more horses); 4) vegetable QQ gardeners, tobacco-planters, etc.
, are singled out.

REMARKS ON E.
STUMPFE’S WORKS 92 A AN ANALYSIS OF DATA STUMPFE’S ARTICLE, “ON THE COMPETITIVENESS OF SMALL AND MEDIUM LAND HOLDINGS AS COMPARED WITH LARGE LAND HOLDINGS” S t u m p f e .
“Über die Konkurrenzfähigkeit des kleinen und mittleren Grundbesitzes gegenüber dem Grossgrund-besitze.
” Thiels landwirtschaftliche Jahrbücher, 1896, Band 5.
Stumpfe comes straight to the point by saying that if large units in agriculture were superior to the small, as they are in industry, the law on the settlement of Eastern Prussia would have been a mistake, and the Social-Democrats would have been right (p.
58).
According to the 1882 data, medium farms (10-100 ha!!) = 12.
4 % of the farms and 47.
6 % of the land— hence the “great economic importance of the peasantry” ! (p.
58).
9 farms [Big and medium—kept books.
Small farms— “strongest mistrust” p.
59].
Group I.
Glogau district—sandy soil, rye and potatoes.
II.
Neumarkt and Breslau districts—good soil, ” beet crops, very intensive.
III.
Liegnitz district—lower intensiveness, weaker ” root crops.

66)), says: While, on the strength of the big outlays under the head of feed and artificial fertilisers, and also the large expen-diture on wages, and taking account of the sandy soil, the landowner’s estate should be characterised as highly intensive and undoubtedly quite up to the modern standard, the very opposite has to be said of the two peasant farms.
“In almost every respect they are still being run on the old | | lines, and their production should be classified as extensive, | in terms of capital and labour.
No feed or fertilisers Sic! | are purchased; on the contrary, considerable quantities | of straw and also rye and potatoes, especially, are sold.
| In consequence, there is insufficient compensation of nutri-| tive substances.
.
.
.
The result is worse crops and a shortage | of livestock.
“The stubbornness with which local peasants stick to !?? their old habits is very hard to understand, especially in view of the good example they daily have before them, which could, after all, stimulate them to competition.
However, in the recent period, it appears, there, too, a turn for the better is beginning” (p.
61).
Remuneration for the owner’s labour is reckoned at 7,500 for the big farm (the usual salary of a manager!!) ÷ 5 (the owner has 5 estates!!) = 1,500.
For the medium farm— 350 (“the usual pay for the country” (p.
64) for managing such a farm!).
For the small farm—300 (“a unit!!! half the size of the preceding one” p.
66).
No size of family is given.
Concerning Group II, Stumpfe remarks that the farms are not quite comparable, because the l a n d i s b e t t e r on the big farm (the whole farm is a pearl among the Sile-sian estates (p.
74), according to a professor from Halle!!), * See pp .
232-36 .
—Ed .
and it is m u c h b e t t e r situated, only 1 mile from Breslau (the small farms are much farther away).
Still!! small farming is particularly profitable!!! About the medium farm of Group II: “But the espe-P cially great advantage of peasant farming is that it is N entirely in the owner’s hands, and that work in one’s M own interest and for one’s personal profit will nearly always be of higher value, and more economical and N profitable than work in the interest of others” (p.
69).
Q For the small farm, remuneration is 450 marks = (1) for the owner—350 & (2) 100 marks to his wife’s parents, who substitute for hired labour (pp.
72-73).
[I must say that the substitution is cheap!] The medium farm is said to be on the modern level as well, and is in general quite faultless, not worse than the big farm.
(No detailed data on machinery!!) The village has an amalgamated dairy, and there is joint use of machinery, joint purchase of fertilisers, etc.
! About Group III we learn only that the big farm is excel-lently run (p.
74) [The entire description of Group III is highly superficial (pp.
74-77).
] Stumpfe’s conclusion: the smaller the holding, the larger the rent (p.
77).
.
.
.
There is not the slightest doubt that on peasant farms where the owner takes due care of the progress of operations or takes part in them himself, the work is performed qualitatively and quantitatively very differently from the way it is done on the landowners’ estates, with the exception, perhaps, of the quanti-tative side in case of piecework (p.
78).
.
.
.
which is why, despite the partially insignificant gross income, the net profit of the small farms was still higher.

In general, this effort to make use even of the smallest objects, this possibility of pressing down to a minimum expenses on the farm’s small current requirements is an important characteristic advantage of the small farm.
.

” (p.
92).
The Social-Democrats have also issued their threats in the countryside—there will be strikes as well, and all this is a much greater danger to the big farms (94).
The big farmer’s expenses on labour are higher, because he has to feed whole families of labourers, whereas the small farmer for the most part takes on unmarried men, and although the labourer’s food is considerably better on the peasant farms and is, consequently, costlier than on the land-owners’ estates, we have here, on the other hand, the resultant much higher productivity of labour by young, strong and well-fed labourers, and this fact is of great importance, especially since much N.

STUMPFE’S BOOK, SMALL HOLDINGS AND GRAIN PRICES Dr.
Emil Stumpfe (Der kleine Grundbesitz und die Getrei-depreise.
Leipzig 1897, Band III, Heft 2 der Staats-und Sozialwissenschaftliche Beiträge von Miaskowski * ) gives a rather interesting summary of quite extensive budgetary data on small farms ( 181 under-10-ha farms) in various parts of Germany, but o n l y on their sale and purchase of farm products.
Stumpfe argues with David (Neue Zeit No.
36, 1894/5), who took the data of the Hessen Inquiry and reckoned the sales and purchases.
(Kühn simply reckoned the sales per hectare).
Stumpfe deducts 33-40% as the cost of fabrication from the purchase price, on the plea that you cannot take the price of the purchased product but only the price of the raw material which has gone into the making of the product!! This approach (an absurd one) spoils the whole work terribly.

179-181 ” This means that only in three cases has Stumpfe’s absurd approach distorted the state of affairs, by turning an overall minus (excess of purchases over sales) into a plus.
In the vast majority of cases, the result is still an overall minus.
(Stumpfe calculates three types of plus and minus, separately for cereals (I), livestock products (III) and the rest (II)).
That is why I find that I can take Stumpfe’s table with its conclusions on the pluses and minuses (sales and pur-chases, as a sum total), making note of t h r e e corrections.
Stumpfe makes a separate comparison of sales and pur-chases in I, II and III: I cereals and pulses II all other cropping products III livestock products giving tables for (1) I (2) I & II (3) I & II & III Stumpfe then gives separate results for the states, sepa-rating s o u t h e r n G e r m a n y (Baden 60 * ), Hessen 44, Württemberg 1 2 & Bavaria) from n o r t h e r n Ger-many (Saxony 6 & 2 8 , Silesia 24, Hannover 7).

The area under cereals in Germany in 1878—52.
59 % of total farm-land 1883—53.
46% 1893—54.
37% The extension of the area under other cereals (and of livestock farming correspond-ingly) is rapidly leading to their respective overproduction, which tends again to even out prices (cf.
Marx on Smith.
But Stumpfe does not quote Marx and does not apply the theory of rent to the question) Stumpfe’s italics “Thus, there is good ground for the thesis that there can be no prolonged disproportions in the rent yielded by the several crops per area unit, and that a levelling off must follow sooner or later” (p.
15).
Stumpfe also analyses the prices of livestock products, arguing along the same lines.
Stumpfe polemises with Reichschancellor Hohenlohe, who said on March 29, 1895, that only the over-12-ha farms wanted higher prices, that is, only 4 million out of the 19 million agricultural population, reckoning 3.
5 persons per farm.

1 millionStumpfe believes that there is no more than 0.
6 million agricultural population on the 3 millions of under-2-ha farms.
“The owners of under-1-ha parcel farms .
.
.
are mostly craftsmen, small industrialists, factory workers, etc.
, consequently, any-thing but peasants or independent farm owners” (p.
39).
Sic! Stumpfe says something quite different on another occasion! 3.
5 persons per farm with less than 2 ha, for “after all, grown up children mostly go into employment right away” (p.
40).
Here are the statistics of family size, according to Stumpfe’s data: The number per farm was (p.

85 And Stumpfe concluded: the “average” for the 5 to 20 ha group will be precisely about 7, for the 20 to 100 ha, about 13, if it is about 11 for the 20 to 30 ha group.
(A funny character! he’s forgotten all about h i r e d labour!!) (Stumpfe’s distribution of agricultural population is of some interest for the picture of hired labour.
) He says that all peasants—including the labourers ! on the big farms!!—all want higher corn prices.
Stumpfe himself suspects that the data he has collected (for Silesia, etc.
, see above * ) will appear unlikely (p.
50), ! * See p .
241 .

and so he defends himself in advance: why is it that, accord-ing to his data, the conditions in northern Germany are much better, when southern Germany is regarded as being more civilised? And Stumpfe attacks southern Germany “.
.
.
incred-ible fragmentation of holdings” (p.
48)—10-12-20 parcels per hectare!—hence “the intensified supply of farms with labour everywhere” (p.
49)—in general the population in the south is much more static (p.
49)—see, he says, the Bavarian Inquiry of 1 8 9 5, the new one!—a prevalence of three-field farming (Bavaria; inquiry)—“great back-wardness of the whole economy” (p.
51), very frequently the system of compulsory crop rotation still in evidence, furthermore “fragmentation and stripping of farmlands prevent or hamper any kind of melioration” (p.
52), frequently make almost impossible the introduction and use of ha-ha!! these new remarkably improved agricultural imple-ments (p.
52), for example, out of 24 Bavarian communities only 4 use the seed drill.
“The advan-tages of farming with the use of the seed drill are ha-ha! so well-known and incontestable” (p.
52) etc.
, and other machines are rare too, old ploughs are “often of the most primitive form” (p.
52), rollers are unknown, etc.
.
.

This backwardness in machine ! and technical equipment.

.
.
The very same Stumpfe who, on another occa-sion, deprecates the importance of machinery— ha-ha! when he defends the small farms! —not a single centrifuge (p.
53) in the places described by the South-German inquiries.
“This technical backward-ness is crowned” with reports from Christazhofen and Inger-kingen of threshing by horses (on horseback)—“such is the antediluvian method of husking grain”—Stumpfe exclaims.

Fertilising methods leave very much to be desired (53), etc.
P —meanwhile, quotations from The Condition of the in favour of small farms in the north (pp.
54-55).

, etc.
(p.
55), the crop rotation system prevails, rollers (pp.
56-57).
“One need only list these very important (sic!) implements to discover the extremely different state of farming in southern and northern Germany” (p.
57).
Then “there is the usual under-estimation” (p.
58)—in the north, the “good example” (p.
59) set by the landowners (sic!), the “teachers” of the peas-ants (!), a model, “pioneers in farming” (p.
59)! As for the South, it more or less completely lacks big farms (p.

“It was on the big farms that conditions first existed for the use of agricultural machinery” (p.

Now they supply machines for the small ones as well.
The author wants to discover the limits for these new machines according to the new data.

4 The author calculates his limits of usefulness as follows: he takes performance per day (5 ha per steam plough), determines the price of manual (resp.
with the use of a team) labour in that time, and calculates the minimum number of days of machine work required for the price to be t h e s a m e.
This minimum (in terms of ha) is his limit.
(Hence, that is the minimum limit where the machine is still not cheaper than manual labour.
) The author frequently quotes Bensing (counter-ing his statements, for instance, with that of Rim-pau, to the effect that a horse-drawn plough works as well as the steam plough, provided it ploughs to the same depth: p.
8).
Potato planters are still not feasible (the potatoes vary in size, and weigh 8 centners to 4 ha, while ! * See p .
250 .
—Ed .
seed-grain comes to less than 1 centner).
But one recent invention is a hole potato-planter which makes regular holes, helps to furrow and hoe, although the potato is inserted by hand (p.
11).
N.
B.
Saves labour, and the income increase is reckoned at 5% (p.
12).
There has been no success so far in making reasonably good potato and beet lifters.

10 (cent-ners) Consequently, the cost reduction is not large.
This, he says, is against Bensing, for he fails to debit to the machine costs the cost of the teams (p.
28)—“not quite right”.
Considering that the cost of the teams does not apply to some machines set into motion by draught animals (for the cattle is there anyway, and is not fully used), we find the limits of economic usefulness still further reduced (p.
28) (see, AA in table * ) “It goes without saying that farmers whose hold-ing hardly, if at all, allows them to use machinery because of its size, are at a disadvantage, as com-pared with those who attain the highest possible use of machinery or are close to it, in view of the fact that the per-hectare cost of using machinery does * See p .
249 .
—Ed .
not fall in proportion to the time of use, but at first drops sharply and then slower and slower” (p.
29).
For instance, a mower costs 5.
94 Mk per ha for 8 days 5.
24 ” per ha for 20 days ” ” “.
.
.
70 pfennigs per hectare is, of course, not much” ha-ha! (p.
30).
Moreover, the “really” lower % of machine depreciation should be allowed the small farmer: he takes more care.
See, he says, Auhagen, * Stumpfe, ** H e r k n e r (!) (The Labour Problem, Berlin, 1897, p.
226).
The small farmer can make co-operative use of machinery: hire of machinery (thresher very often, p.
31) (it is also most convenient with regard to the steam plough, p.
32) (although the small one cannot use the steam plough even on hire: p.
33, his fields are not long enough).
The hiring out of machinery .
.
.
is very com-mon (p.
33).
“The big landowner lets .
.
.
his small neighbours .
.
.
use his seed drill on hire”.

The c o -o p e r a t i v e s are developed to a greater extent than the statistics show.
In 1890, Bavaria had 282 machine (thresher) co-operatives.
But very many farms pool machines privately.
Chapter III.
“The Importance of Machinery for the Labour Problem”.
Machines are frequently introduced, even when they are more expensive (seeders, etc.
) because of the labour shortage.
Can the machines help when there is a shortage of labour? Most say: yes (p.
37).
Von der Holtz is sceptical (they tend to increase winter unemployment, etc.

6 “With the exception of the seed drill, which is used in the spring and autumn seasons, and the manure spread-er, which requires a roughly similar application of la-bour, all the machines, therefore, show a saving of labour, as compared with manual operations” (p.
38).
especially the cultivator (very important) and the reaper—which is why it is used with the binder, even if it is more expensive (there are few hands during the harvesting!).
The same goes for the steam plough.
“All the above-mentioned machines have the advantage of making the farmer more independent of the demand for labour.
He can oppose the excessive wage demands at whose mercy he would otherwise have been placed without being able to offer any resistance, and, what is much more important, he can perform operations for which he would otherwise not have found any labour at all” (p.
40).
The manure spreader works better, more evenly, than the unskilled labourer.
The seed drill h e l p s t o s a v e seed stock.
“The milk separator is also one of those machines which yield a qualitative performance coefficient unattainable under manual labour” (p.
41).
In 1900, Germany had 2,841 dairy co-operatives.
The 1895 statistics show furthermore that it was the peasant farms that led in the absolute number of partici-pants in them, whereas the large farms, at any rate, are still very far ahead in proportion to their total.
“Participation in dairy co-operatives or amalgamated dairies” (p.
41) under 2 ha 2 to 5 ha 5 to 20 ha 20 to 100 ha 100 ha and over farmspercentage of each group 10,300 31,819 53,597 43,561 8,8050.

1 “However, the relatively insignificant partici-pation of the small farms in dairy co-operatives is partly due to the fact that they are mostly situat-ed on the immediate outskirts of towns and sell more of their milk than large farms to urban buyers, without processing it” (p.
41).
The thresher leads to a substitution of free labour-ers for indentured day labourers who do the thresh-ing (p.
42) (cf.
Max Weber).
Payment in kind is supplanted by payment i n c a s h —“as a result of which even the smaller holder becomes more depend-!ÈN.

ent on ready cash than ever before.

.
.
Such are the socially unfavourable consequences of the introduction of the thresher” (p.
42).
Agricultural machines demand more intelligent workers (as compared to the industrial??).
.
.
Chapter IV.
“Electricity in Agriculture”.
The author finds the expectations of Kautsky and Prings-heim exaggerated, gives two examples of actual use of electricity (on royal estates in 1895-96), contests one calcu-lation, obtaining a higher cost of production instead of the lower one (inferred by the author of a report on the royal estates) and says that “electrification of farming is not yet able to yield any considerable reduction of costs, although it does provide all sorts of conveniences and comforts for the performance of operations” (p.
51).
Is it cheaper for the big farms? Not much, for the motors in agriculture are all too small.
The substitution of electric motors for field machines (Pringsheim) is a realm of speculation.
Finale: “The production of electric power will remain cheapest at the big central stations, with which the small farmer can just as easily obtain a connection as the big one.
The advantages secured by the latter from a somewhat better use of motors and any possible small rebate that he may be given will be insignificant.
That is why any shift of social relations to the detriment of small farming should not be expected” (p.
54).
Chapter V.
“Machinery in North-American Agriculture” The limit of the economic usefulness of machines is (must be) even lower, because wages are higher.
There is the most rapid growth of m e d i u m farms (George K.
Holmes on the progress of American agriculture in Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture, 1899).
320 acres= 128 ha is taken to be a medium farm, ] because the whole of farming is extensive: p.
58.
^There is nowhere any swallowing up of the small by the big (p.
62), machines cannot give the big farms the edge they do in industry (p.
63).
The farms will be increasingly smaller with the growth of intensiveness.
The small farms have the same machines as the big ones.
Example: 300-320 acres 1 plough 1 disc 1 seed with seat harrow drill and 6,500 acres 22 ” 32 10 ” ” etc.
(Fischer sees no advantages from diversified machin-ery!) “Thus, large-scale farming there does not obtain any ? advantages from the use of machinery” (p.
59)? The small holder is more careful, more painstaking, he saves the $100 which the big farmer pays to his labourers as a bonus for the best cultivated lots, etc.
!! (p.
59).
The large wheat farms, with very extensive farming, are to be found only in North Dakota.
Greater use? (156 acres per binder in one case, and 65 acres, on a small farm), but that is “only little” ?! (p.
61).
Final conclusions (pp.
64-66) .
.
.
the machines are used mostly because of the labour shortage; more and more are being introduced on the small farms % increase from 1882 to 1895 (p.
65) Steam ploughs Seed drills ReapersSteam threshersOther threshers under2ha33211410733145 2-5ha257187669414187 5-20 ha171226352214130 20-100 ha2011698316057 over 100 ha87769831ha-ha! Sic! “This comparison shows that the percentage increase in the number of farms using machinery among the small farms .
.
.
is considerably greater than among the big ones.
.
.
.
” .
.
.
These figures best of all prove (!?) that machin-ery in agriculture is not at all a domain of the big farms (p.
66), for there is a rapid growth in the understanding of its importance and the possi-bility of its use even on the parcel farms.

The Inquiry consisted of 33 volumes, which were not on sale.
The first 4 volumes gave a general summary of which a resume was made by Mr.
Turot.
Although his work has been “crowned” with a gold medal, it is on the lowest pos-sible level.
It is not a summary of the Inquiry data, but a summary of the “data on the decisions” of the central commission in charge of the Inquiry.
And its decisions are such, for instance, as that machinery should be imported duty-free, that inventors must be rewarded (pp.
84-87: no data at all on the use of machinery!!),—that labour cards, should not be introduced (pp.
81-84), etc.

The peasant farmers, who share the status of small holder and rural labourer, are fairly well off”—for instance, outlays are 510 francs (husband & wife), receipts = 850 francs.

It is quite impossible and unnecessary to read the meanderings of this “titled old man”, and only “critics” of the Bulgakov stripe can take such a writer seriously.

Grandeau (manager of the Station agronomique de l’Est) believes that there are 25 million ha of farmland in France taken from the land annually: given same metric tons thousands Nitrogen 613,000 285 P fertilisers produced Phosphoric acid 298,000 147 by 49 million head M of Potash 827,000 549 cattle (according — & Q to Tisserand) P That is the total P but not all M cattle, should be reckoned in M Q terms of fertiliser! Q i.
e.
, the deficit averages about 5 0 p e r c e n t! (p.
101) And the artificial fertilisers do not, by a long shot, make up for all that is taken from the soil.
In Britain, an average of 1.
9 million centners of phos-phoric acid is taken from the soil, while guano and bone fertiliser cover only one-half (p.
109).
Thus, only the private owners, and not the land, have benefited from intensive agriculture with the use of artificial fertilisers (p.
109).
It is now being recognised that mineral and artificial fertilisers alone are not enough.

In the past, they wanted to substitute them (p.
111) by 125 kg of phosphoric acid &60 kg of nitrogen &60 kg of potash It is now recognised that mineral fertilisers alone tend to dry up the soil, and that an addition of manure is also necessary.
Grandeau believes that out of 60,000 kg there must be at least 0, 0 0 0 kg of natural fertiliser.

] The result arrived at by Nossig (who makes use of the ] latest agronomical data, and cites Grandeau, Déherain, ] Wollny, Hellriegel, Dünckelberg, Cohn, and many others) is that even intensive farming frequently comes to plun-dering the soil.
It increases yields temporarily, but fails to bring about a long-term and stable increase in soil fertility.
Human fertilisers must also be returned to the land (pp.

I and II, Wash.
, 1899.
105) [A very interesting and original work, invaluable on the question of hand and machine production.
Quantity of working time, the number of operations and the number of different workers in hand and machine labor, and also labor costs are compared by article produced or work accomplished (“unit”—altogether 672 units).
In each unit the same data are given separately for each operation.
Unfortunately, the data are excessively fragmented, and there is no attempt to summarise, or to give any general numerical, even if only approximate, conclusions.
cf.
p.
93: the general conclusion on agriculture: “The aggregates presented by these 27 units necessarily vary very much with the crop produced, and the gains made by the supplanting of primitive methods by modern ones are quite different in different instances.
With the exception noted in unit 22 there is a gain in each case, and in some instances, as in units 3 and 26, it is very large, though of course not comparable with those found in the manufactur-ing industries.
An average deduced from the 27 units here reported shows that one man with the improved machinery in use to-day can cultivate and harvest nearly twice as large a crop as was possible under the primitive method.
” (These 27 units—production of apple trees, wheat, cotton, barley, berries, tobacco, potatoes, etc.
In Volume One, each unit is divided into operations.
)In general, the number of operations is much greater in machine production (division of labour! e.
g.
, boots and shoes: 45-102 operations in hand production, and 84-173 in machine production), but in agriculture it may sometimes (perhaps more often) be vice versa).
Reason: the combination of several operations in machine production.

A pity that no effort is made to summarise for some of the “units”.
Another thing that should be done is to sum up the number of operations (and % of operations) with motive power other than hands.
There are no summaries on average ages of workers (and sex) under hand and machine labour.
No summaries on wages under hand and machine labour.
All this can (and should) be calculated by number of units and number of operations.
Otherwise, there remains nothing but examples , illustrations.

9 below = average per head of cattle * For a precise calculation of the area under feed on each farm, the quantities of four cereals (wheat, rye, barley and oats) fed to the livestock should be given in terms of h e c t a r e s, (1) the grain sown should be subtracted from the total crop; (2) the net crop obtained should be divided by the number of hectares under each cereal; (3) the number of double centners fed to the livestock should be divided by the quo-tient thus obtained.
This is too cumbersome a calculation for the four cereals, the four farms, and the two five-year periods.
On the other hand, the error could not be too great if we take all the oats as being feed, for the oats not going into feed are balanced out by the barley going into feed.
* This sentence was subsequently pencilled in over the table heading; it refers to the lower figures in columns 2, 3 and 4.

The difference is not due to any difference in rates, but to Huschke’s very detailed classification of cattle.
He makes a distinction between foals, young cattle, calves, suckling-pigs (p.

Agricultural Production Statistics.
First three subvolumes: 1 a; 1 b; a From the “preliminary remarks” to tables 4 and 5 (“Part 1 b”).
These figures were first collected in 1907.
“The ground for classifying under these 11 heads according to number of personnel was the data under letter C 1-3 of the master card; consequently, account was also taken of family mem-bers helping out (C 2 b) and casual labour (C 3 c)” (p.
455).
“.

.
The number of farms classified under heads 14-64” (establishments by number of labourers: 1, 2, etc.
, to 200) “is as a rule smaller than the total number of farms in the first column” (the number of a l l agricultural enterprises), “because it contains, in addition, figures for farms only with the greatest number of labourers and farms without personnel” (455).

__ ]] ]] ]] To show that it is not right to classify labour in agricul-ture by sex and age, I give the data (Statistisches Jahrbuch, 1910) for the whole of i n d u s t r y according to the Census of June 12, 1907.
Total personnel = 1 4 , 3 4 8 , 0 1 6, including women—3 , 5 1 0, 4 6 4 (= 24.

The table refers to Occupations Group I (type of occupation A 1)= agriculture, breeding of animals used in agriculture, dairy farming, milk collector, agricultural wine-making, fruit-growing, vegetable gardening, tobacco-growing, etc.

4).
“The subgroup of occupations I A (type of occupations A 1) includes: A 1) owners and co-owners; A 2) leaseholders, hereditary leaseholders; A 3) managing employees, other managers of production; B 1) employees on farms, also trainees and apprentices; B 2) supervisory personnel; B 3) book-keepers and office workers; C 1) family members working on the farm of the head of household; C 2) agricultural farm-hands, male and female; C 3) agricultural labourers, day labourers, cultivating their own or leased land; C 4) agricultural labour-ers, day labourers, not cultivating their own or leased land, but other land; C 5) agricultural labourers, day labour-ers, not cultivating any land” (p.

On the whole, says the author, small-scale production is weaker (p.

There are special crops, vegetable gar-dening, but their part is weak.

7 Both wings of the Social-Democrats are said to be wrong: the Radicals in that they tend to forget the difference be-tween agriculture and industry, and the revisionists in that they allege the superiority of small-scale production to be the cause (of the development towards small-scale pro-duction) (p.
433).
The author is a middle-of-the-roader (11), a fool.
He says small and middle (5-20 ha) peasant farms are growing stronger, area statistics for 1907, etc.

Bern 1910 in der The author is a practitioner from an agricultural school at Rütti, Berne.
This school itself uses an electric motor for farming operations.
The author has collected data on electric motors in Swiss agriculture.
Result: highly recom-mends that peasant co-operatives use electric motors.
“At present, no other mechanical engine can match the electric motor’s simple and reliable operation, insignificant wear and tear, great adaptability, instant readiness for use, minimal requirements in supervision and maintenance, and the consequent low overhead costs.
.
.
.
Production-wise, it will pay big farms to have their own motor in most cases.
Medium and small farms are advised to purchase and run an electric motor co-operatively .

Summary and Conclusions —155REMARKS ON AMERICAN AGRICULTURAL STATISTICS The most interesting thing American agricultural statis-tics provide—in novelty and importance for economic science—is the comparison of three groupings: by acreage (conventional); 2) by principal source of income; 3) by gross income—by value of products not fed to livestock (probably, gross cash income).
The second and third groupings are a novelty, which is highly valuable and instructive.
There is no need to say much about the second one.
Its importance lies in showing the economic types of farm with a bias for some aspect of commercial agriculture.
This grouping gives an excellent idea of the impossibility of com-paring various types of farm (by acreage), and so of the limits within which the acreage grouping can be applied (resp.
the conclusions to be drawn from this kind of group-ing).
To 1) Farms of these types cannot be compared by acreage: Hay & grain as the principal sources of income.
Average size of farm—159.
3 acres (see, pp.
7-8 of my extracts * ).
Average expenditure for labour—$76 per farm ($0.
47 per acre).
Flowers & plants.
Average size = 6.
9 acres.
Average expenditure for labour = $675 per farm, $9 7 .
4 per acre, that is, 9,742 ÷ 47 = 207 times greater.
Of course, the number of farms with flowers as the prin-cipal source of income is insignificant (0.
1 %), and that with hay & grain, very large (23.
0 %), but a calculation of * See pp.

—Ed.
the average would give a false impression.
The number of cereal farms (hay & grain) is 200 (214) times greater (1,319,856 ÷ 6,159 = 214), but their average expenditure for labour per acre is 1/207 of the figure for the flower farms.
The same applies, with due alterations, to vegetables (2.
7 % of all farms; expenditure for labour = $1.
62 per acre, with an average of $0.
43 ); fruits (1.
4 % of all farms, labour—$2.
40 per acre), etc.
The cereal farms are large in acreage (159.
3 acres on an average) but have low income (in terms of gross incomes— an average of $665 of gross income per farm.
On the flower farms—6.
9 acres—$2,991 of gross income per farm.
Fruits—74.
8 acres, $915 of gross income per farm, etc, Or take dairy produce.
The farms are smaller than average: 121.
9 acres versus 146.
6 —and smaller than the cereal farms (159.
3 acres) but their gross income is higher: $787 (versus an average of $656, and $760 for the hay & grain farms).
Expenditure for labour per farm = $105 (versus an average of $64, and $76 for hay & grain) and $0.
86 per acre, i.
e.
double the average ($0.
43 per acre).
They have livestock valued at $5.
58 per acre (versus an average of $3.
66 ); imple-ments & machinery, $1.
66 per acre (versus an average of $0.
90).
And that is not unique for the United States, but is the rule for all capitalist countries.
What is the implication in the case of a switch from cropping to dairy farming? For example (α) 10 grain farms switch to dairy farming.
(β) 10 farms 8 160 = 1,600 acres ÷ 120 (average dairy produce farm) = 13 farms The scale of production is reduced.
The smaller farm wins out! Expenditure for labour 10 8 76 = $ 760 (α) Almost (β) 13 8 105 = $ 1,365 (β) t w i c e > !! This means that the switch to dairy farming—as well as to vegetables, fruits, etc.
—leads to a reduction in theaverage farm acreage, to an increase in its capitalist expend-itures (= intensification of its capitalist character), and to an increase in production (gross income: α = 760 8 10 = $ 7,600 β = 787 8 13 = $10,231) To 2) What are the limits for applying the grouping by acreage? Ordinary, grain, farms are in the majority.
In America, hay & grain = 23%; livestock (extensive N.
B.
[mixed with intensive]) = 27.
3 %; miscellaneous = 18.
5 %.
Σ = 68.
8 %.
Consequently, general laws may become appar-ent even in general averages, but only in the gross totals, wherever there is known to be no switch from old farms to new (but where does that happen?), from farms with a similar investment of capital per hectare (per acre).
The great defect of American statistics is the failure to give combined tables.
It would be extremely important to make a comparison of data on farms by acreage within the limits of one type of farm.
That is not done.
Now for the third, new type of grouping—by gross income.
A comparison of it with the first, conventional grouping (by acreage) is highly instructive.
The quantity of livestock (value) per acre.
By acreage: there is a regular r e d u c t i o n, without a single excep-tion: from $4 5 6 .
7 6 per acre (< 3-acre farms) to $2.
15 per acre (1,000 acres and over), i.
e.
, some 200 odd times greater! This is a ridiculous comparison, because heteroge-neous magnitudes are involved.
By gross income: there is an i n c r e a s e (with 2 not very big exceptions: when income is at 0 and at $,5 0 0 and > to a maximum) p a r a l l e l to the i n c r e a s e in acreage (also with two exceptions: at 0 and at the mini-mum).
Expenditure for labour per acre.
By acreage.
There is a reduction (with one exception) from $40.
3 0 (< 3 acres) to $0.
2 5 (> 1,000 acres).

The grouping by income combines the big and the small acreage farms, where they are similar in the level of capital-ism.
The predominant importance of such a “factor” as land remains and stands out in the grouping, but it is seen to be (co)subordinate to capital.
The grouping by income: the differences between the groups in expenditure for labour ($4—$786) per farm, are tremendous, but are relatively small per acre ($0.
06 —$0.
72 ).
The grouping by acreage: the differences between the groups in expenditure for labour per farm ($16—$1,059) are less significant, but are tremendous per acre ($40.
3 0 — $0.
25 ) By acreage: income (gross per farm) by groups: $592— $1,913 ($55,334), i.
e.
the differences are very small.
Depending on whether you take gross income or acreage as the yardstick, the ratios between small and large farms (in America) turn out to be d i a m e t r i c a l l y opposed (by the main indicators and by the most important one for the capitalist economy, namely, expenditures for labour).
It should be noted that America’s agricultural statistics shows up its one main distinction from continental Europe.
In America, the % of parcel (proletarian?) farms is i n -s i g n i f i c a n t : 11.
8 % of farms under 20 acres (= 8 ha).
In Europe, it is g r e a t (in Germany, more than one-half are under ha).
In America, agricultural capitalism is more clear-cut, the division of labour is more crystallised; there are fewer bonds with the Middle Ages, with the soil-bound labourer; ground-rent is not so burdensome; there is less intermixing of commercial agriculture and subsistence farming.

The most interesting aspect of American statistics is the combination (even if not consistent) of the three group-ings: by acreage, by income and by principal source of income.
A comparison of the groupings by acreage and by income (pp.
10 and 9 of the extracts) clearly shows the superiority of the l a t t e r.

5% With reference to this increase in the propor-tion of farms mortgaged, it should be borne in mind that the fact of mortgage debt is not neces-sarily an indication of lack of prosperity.
There can be no question that American farmers general-ly were more prosperous in 1910 than at the two preceding censuses.
The percentage of mortgaged farms is said to be highest in the most prosperous states, such as Iowa and Wisconsin.
In some cases a farm is mortgaged out of need, in others for improvements, etc.
(p.
158).
The breaking-up of certain plantations into small farms—farms owned by their operators but mort-gaged for part of the purchase price—probably also has had something to do with the increase in the proportion of farms mortgaged in the South (p.
159).

Thus, in the South, the Whites have more owners than tenants, and the Negroes, vice versa.
In 1900, the Negroes had 767,764 farms (including 740,670 in the S o u t h).
Consequently, the number of Negro farms increased by &1 9.

Concerning the role, importance and place of tenants vis-à-vis o w n e r s: Tenant farmers reported a much larger proportion of the value of land than of the value of buildings, implements & machinery, or livestock.
This is largely due to the fact that tenant farmers in general are less well-to-do than farm owners and are less able to furnish their farms with expen-sive equipment (pp.
100-01).
The average for the United States (1910) shows: the value of owners’ land = 66.
8 % of all property, and that of “tenants” = 74.
9 % (p.
101, Table 5).
Concerning the owners of farms leased, the authors (p.
102) refer to the inquiry during the 1900 Census, when the names of owners of tenant farms were studied.
They say there was no concentration or “absentee landlordism”.
The owners of leased farms are for the most part former tenants “who have either retired altogether, gone into other business, or taken up farms in newer sections of the country”.
“In the South the conditions have at all times been somewhat different from those in the North, and many of the tenant farms are parts of planta-tions of considerable size which date from before the Civil War.
” In the South, “the system of oper-ation by tenants—chiefly coloured tenants—has succeeded the system of operation by slave labour” (102).

Concerning rent: The development of the tenant system is most conspicuous in the South, where the large plantations formerly operated by slave labour have in many cases been broken up into small parcels or tracts and leased to tenants.
As more fully explained in Chapter I, these plantations are in * See present edition, Vol .

many cases still operated substantially as agricultural units, the tenants being sub-jected to a degree of supervision more or less similar to that which hired farm labourers are subjected to in the North” (p.

shown for the Mountain and Pacific divisions, where it is doubtless attrib-utable mainly to the fact that those divisions have been only recently settled and that many of the farmers in them are homesteaders who have obtained their land from the Government” (p.

The whole Chapter II (“Farm tenure”) does not contain any analysis of the causes of the growth (respective decrease) in the n u m b e r o f o w n e r s of land.
These authors are bourgeois scum: they gloss over the most important thing (expropriation of the small farmers)!! Growth of rural population (1900-10) number of farms .

1% (still less) An obvious increase in expropriation!! But the increase is even more evident if we take the N o r t h, the S o u t h and the W e s t.
The total number of farms has gone up from 5,737,372 to 6,361,502, i.
e.
, by 64,130 (p.
114, Table 18), i.
e.
, by 10.
9 per cent.
But in the N o r t h the increase is only 0.
6% (& 16,545 farms!!).
This is stagnation.
Moreover, there was also an absolute r e d u c t i o n in the number of farms in three out of the four divisions of the North, namely, New England, Middle Atlantic and East.
In North Central, there was an a b s o l u t e d r o p i n t h e n u m b e r o f f a r m s (by 32,000).
Only in West North Central was there an increase by 4 9,000 (hence, in Σ = &16,500).
But West North Central includes states like the two Dakotas, Nebraska and Kansas, where homesteading is still exten-sive (see Statistical Abstract, p.
28).
In general, the number of owners in the entire North: 1900—2,088,000 1910— 2,091,000 &3,000 =0.
1%!!! The entire North owners: part owners: 1900 1910 1,794,216 1,749,267293,612 342,167 —44,949&48,555 Thus, there was a reduction in the number of owners!! The number of p a r t owners went up!! And this same North had 60% of all the improved land in the United States (1910)!! In this North, the acreage of improved land increased by 10.
9%, from 261 million to 290 million acres!! In the W e s t , the growth in the number of farms and the number of owners is understandable: the country is being settled, and there is a growing number of h o m e -s t e a d s (see Statistical Abstract, p.
28 and the above quotation from p.
1 0 4, p.
3 of these extracts).
* And the S o u t h << Share tenants (m o s t l y Negroes) there mainly (1) account for the growth in the number of farms.
This means greater exploitation of the Negroes.
Then (2), there is a growing number of o w n e r s .
Why?? Apparently it is due to the parcellisation of the p l a n t a -t i o n s .
P.
265 (Table 8) shows that the acreage in the 1,000-and-> acre farms in the United States fell by 30,702,109 acres (—15.

7& — —& & — The United StatesThe distinctive features of the three sections stand out clearly: The North: 1) The highest development of capitalism.
2) Stagnation in the number of farms.
3) Reduction in the number and share of medium farms.
4) Growth in the number and share of large (and very small, but to a less degree).
5) Weak latifundia (> 1,000: 0.
5 % of the farms and 6.
9% of the land).
The South: 1) The lowest development of capitalism.
2) The greatest development of share-tenancy (49.
6 % are tenant farms).
3) Vast latifundia (> 1,000 acres: 0.
7 % of the farms and 23.
9 % of the land; in the North 0.
5 % of the farms and 6.

4) Disintegration of these latifundia of the former slave-owners (1900-10:—32 million acres—27.

(on the question The contrast between these two sets of of “acreage percentages is the natural result of the fact statistics ” ) that small farms throughout the country usually specialise in cropping, whereas large farms, which in some sections also specialise mainly in cropping, in other sections almost exclusively go in for stock raising (p.
264).
In the South there is a “process of breaking up great plantations into small farms, chiefly operated by tenants” (p.
264).
The great development of small fruit and other farms on the Pacific coast, due, in part at least, to irrigation projects organised in recent years, is reflected in the increase in small farms of less than 50 acres in the Pacific division (p.
264).
* Concerning the commercial character of stock raising, it is interesting to note the % of farms selling livestock, and the % of stock sold and slaughtered (% of all farms selling stock) SwineCattle (excluding calves) 23 .

In the Mountain and Pacific divisions farms of 100 to 174 acres show a lower average value of buildings per farm than those of 50 to 99 acres.
This condition is probably due to the fact that the farms of 100 to 174 acres in these divisions consist in considerable part of homesteads recent-ly taken up by settlers who have not had time, or perhaps have not accumulated means, to con-struct expensive buildings” (p.
271).

The high averages (value of all farm pro-Small perty—for small farms) in these two divisions farms [Mountain and Pacific] are partly due to the in presence of numerous small and highly cultivated the fruit and vegetable farms, many of which are West.

a large proportion of the tenants in the South actually occupied a very different economic position from that usually occupied by tenants in other parts of the country.
The plantation as a unit for general purposes of administration has not disappeared, and in many cases the tenants on plantations are subjected to quite as complete supervision by the owner, general lessee, or manager, as that to which the hired labourers are subject-ed on large farms in the North and West” (p.

2 29,704 169,095 These figures are a clear indication that the small farms are being displaced by the large.
In both divisions, a l l the medium groups (20-499) have been l o s i n g (%).
The gains were registered by (1) the smallest (< 20) (2) the large (500-999 and 1,000 and >).
In percentage and absolute terms (quantity of i m p r o v e d land), the l a r g e farms gained more than the small!! [The small farms (under 20 acres) here are very frequently out-and-out capitalist farms] because they have the maxi-mum % of land under vegetables and a minimum under cereals.
The % increase in agricultural implements and machin-ery (= constant capital in its most important form, which is directly indicative of technical progress) is at a m a x i -m u m in the l a r g e farms, at a minimum in the m e d i-u m farms, with the large ones doing b e t t e r than the smallest!!!

Only in two divisions is there no decline of the l a t i -f u n d i a (1,000 and >), namely, the oldest and capitalist divisions, New England and Middle Atlantic!! In these two divisions, the role of the latifundia has i n c r e a s e d i n a l l r e s p e c t s (including even livestock!!) (Middle Atlan-tic= 0.

28) total number of women engaged in agriculture: 1, 338, 950 instead of 1, 807, 050 (i.

—468,100), and total number of women engaged in a l l branches of the economy, 7, 607,67, instead of 8, 075,77 (—468,100).
My addition: referring this entire overstatement only to those working on the home farms, we have: 1,176,585—468,100 = 708,485 ÷ 441,055 = 166 %&66% * See p.

Written between May 5 (1 8 ), 1 9 1 4 and December 2 9 , 1 9 1 5 (January 1 1 , 1 9 1 6 ) First published in 1 9 3 2 in Lenin Miscellany XIX Printed from the originalNOTES AND INDEXESNOTES 1This work was written in parts: the first nine chapters, from June to September 1901 and the last three, in the autumn of 1907.
In the Fourth Russian edition of Lenin’s Collected Works, it appear-ed in Vol.
5 (chapters I-IX) and in Vol.
13 (chapters X-XII); in the Fifth edition of the Collected Works, the whole of it is in Vol.
5.
The present volume contains the preparatory material: plans for and the contents of the work, critical remarks on the writings of bourgeois economists and revisionists, and elaboration and analysis of agricultural statistics.
The four variants of the plan in this volume reflect Lenin.
’s elabo-ration of the structure and content of “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’”.
Lenin’s primary aim is to expose the general theoretical views of the “critics”, the “law of diminishing returns” as scientifically unsound and the theory of rent connected with it, together with the Malthusian conclusions from both.
He then outlines a detailed critical analysis of bourgeois and revisionist writ-ings on the key problems of agrarian theory and agrarian relations (concentration of production in agriculture, machinery in agricul-ture, etc.
), and exposure of the “critics’” tenuous and scientifical-ly dishonest methods of inquiry and use of factual material.
Lenin makes a special analysis of the statistical data and results of monographic descriptions of agrarian relations in France, Germa-ny and other countries for an examination of the actual processes in agriculture, the capitalist system in contemporary agriculture and a critique of bourgeois and revisionist writings.
The variants of the plan show the successive extension of the range of questions and their content, and Lenin’s changes in the order of the various points.
Lenin repeatedly returned to the fourth variant, the most elaborate and complete.
There, the Roman numerals of the eleven sections of the plan are in pencil, as are also the additional notes to point 12: “ the journal Nachalo (The Beginning) I, pp.
7 and 13 ” and to point 21: “Latifundia.
(Cf.
Hertz 15; Bulgakov II, 126, 190, 363)”.
In point 12, beginning with “No.
4, 141” and to the end of the paragraph and in the note to this point (12) on the right, “Engels on Belgium, No.
10, 234”, and also in the note to point 18, beginning with the words: “Bul-gakov II, 289” and to the end of the paragraph, the words are lightly crossed in pencil.

p.
30 11Ireland was regarded as the example of a country of large landed estates and small (“starvation”) leaseholdings, where tremendous wealth existed side by side with dire poverty and recurring famines a land from which masses of ruined farmers were in night.
Bul-gakov tried to cover up the poverty and the dying-out of the Irish farmers with Malthusian arguments about a “ surplus” population and “shortage” of land, whereas the real reason lay in the monopoly of the landed estates and the fierce exploitation of the small farm-ers.
p.
30 12In their preface to the 1882 Russian edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party, Marx and Engels say this about landed property in the United States: “Step by step the small and middle landownership of the farmers, the basis of the whole political constitution, is succumbing to the competition of giant farms” (Marx and Engels, Selected Works, Vol.
1, Moscow, 1962, p.

The establishment of these estates was designed to strengthen German and weaken Polish influence in these provinces and to assure the big landowners of cheap labour.
This involved the break-up of large landed estates (sometimes bought from Polish landowners) into small and medium tracts title to which was transferred to German peasants upon the payment of the capital amount or the annual rent.
When a settler bought the land by paying the annual rent, he was restricted in his disposal of it: he was not free, without government permission, to divide the estate, sell it in parcels, etc.

3119This is an outline of the contents of the second part of Lenin’s “The Agrarian Question and the “Critics of Marx’” which was first published in Obrazovaniye (Education) No.
2 in February 1906.
The pagination of the manuscript by chapters warrants the assumption that it dates to the period when Lenin was pre-paring the manuscript for publication in the journal.
p.
39 20The two remarks at the bottom of the manuscript enclosed in rectangles are a reckoning of the time it took to read this part of the manuscript.
The first remark relates to Chapter V and the first part of Chapter VI, and is the result of Lenin’s trial in rapid silent reading on the basis of which he drew the conclusion (in the second remark) that it would take “about 2 hours” to read the whole manuscript.
p.
39 21This material is preparatory for Lenin’s lectures on “Marxist Views of the Agrarian Question in Europe and Russia” which he gave at the Higher Russian School of Social Sciences in Paris on February 10-13 (23-26), 1903.
The school was founded in 1901 by a group of liberal professors who had been expelled by the tsarist government from higher schools in Russia (M.
M.
Kova-levsky, Y.
S.
Gambarov and E.
V.
de Roberti); assistance was given to the school by I.
I.
Mechnikov, Elise Reclus, G.
Tard and others.
It operated legally.
The student body consisted mainly of young revolutionary Russian émigrés in Paris and Russian students.
Lenin was invited to lecture on the agrarian question at the insistence of Iskra’s Paris group with the support of the Social-Democratic section of the students.
Lenin gave four lec-tures on February 10, 11, 12 and 13 (23, 24, 25 and 26), 1903 and these were a great success.
In preparing for his lectures, Lenin studied many sources on the agrarian question and made numerous extracts from the works of Marx and Engels, the resolutions of the International, and from books and articles by Russian and foreign authors (P.
P.
Maslov, V.
P.
Vorontsov, David, Nossig, Böttger, Stumpfe, etc.
); he also compiled tables on the basis of Bavarian, Prussian, Württemberg, Dutch and other agricultural inquiries, and made a special translation of Engels’s article, “The Peasant Question in France and Germany” (see Lenin Miscellany XIX, pp.
295-300).
Lenin drew up a programme for his lectures and mailed it to the school beforehand, and wrote two variants of the plan.

50 43Lenin’s lecture on “The Agrarian Programme of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and of the Social-Democrats” was read in Paris on March 3, 1903, after the lectures on the agrarian question at the Higher Russian School of Social Sciences.
The rules of the school did not allow Lenin to draw any conclusions concerning the programme and tactics of the Party in his lectures, and so he formulated them in a special lecture given outside the school, for members of the Russian colony.
His lecture was discussed for four days, from March 3 to 6.
Among his opponents were Nev-zorov (Y.
M.
Steklov) from the Borba group, B.
N.
Krichevsky from Rabocheye Dyelo, Vladimirov (V.
M.
Chernov) from the Narodniks, N.
Chaikovsky and O.
Minor from the Socialist-Revo-lutionaries, and V.
Cherkezov from the anarchists.
The present volume contains two variants of the outline of the lecture, the plans and the outlines of the concluding speech and the resumé of the lecture.
For Lenin’s records of the speeches of his opponents and extracts from various sources and writings see Lenin Miscellany XIX.
The volume and content of the lecture outlines warrant the assumption that he also intended to use them as the plan for a pamphlet against the Socialist-Revolutionaries.
Of his intention to write such a pamphlet, Lenin told Plekhanov in a letter of January 28, 1903 (see Lenin Miscellany IV, p.
208).
p.
53 44Socialist-Revolutionaries (S.
R.
s)—a petty-bourgeois party in Rus-sia, founded in late 1901-early 1902 as a result of the merger of various Narodnik groups and circles (the Union of Socialist-Revolutionaries, the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, etc.
).
The newspaper Revolutsionnaya Rossiya (Revolutionary Russia) (1900-p.
4905), and the journal Vestnik Russkoi Revolutsii (Herald of the Russian Revolution) (1901-05), and later the newspaper Znamya Truda (Banner of Labour) (1907-14) were its official organs.
The views of the S.
R.
s.
were a mixture of Narodnik and revisionist ideas; the S.
R.
s tried, said Lenin, to “patch up the rents in the Narodnik ideas with bits of fashionable opportunist ‘criticism’ of Marxism” (see present edition, Vol.
9, p.
310).
The S.
R.
s failed to see the class distinctions between the proletariat and the peas-antry, glossed over the class stratification and contradictions within the peasantry, and denied the proletariat’s leading role in the revolution.
Their tactics of individual terrorism, which they claimed to be the main means of fighting the autocracy, did a great deal of harm to the revolutionary movement and made it more difficult to organise the masses for the revolutionary struggle.
The agrarian programme of the S.
R.
s called for abolition of private property in land and for egalitarian tenure by communes, and also development of all types of co-operatives.
This programme, which the S.
R.
s claimed would “socialise” the land, had nothing socialist about it, because, as Lenin proved, the elimination of private property in land alone would not do away with the domi-nation of capital and mass poverty.
The real and historically progressive content of their programme was the struggle to abolish the landed estates, a demand which was an objective reflection of the interests and aspirations of the peasants during the bourgeois-democratic revolution.
The Bolshevik Party exposed the S.
R.
s’ attempts to masquerade as socialists, waged a persistent struggle against the S.
R.
s for influence among the peasants and showed the harm their tactics of individual terrorism were inflicting on the working-class move-ment.
At the same time, the Bolsheviks were prepared on definite terms to enter into temporary agreements with the S.
R.
s to fight against tsarism.
Because the peasantry consisted of diverse class elements, the S.
R.
Party ultimately failed to achieve ideological and polit-ical stability and suffered from organisational confusion, con-stantly vacillating between the liberal bourgeoisie and the pro-letariat.
As early as the years of the first Russian revolution, its Right wing split off from the Party to form the legal Trudovik Popular Socialist Party (Popular Socialists), which held views close to those of the Cadets, while its Left wing took shape as a semi-anarchist League of “Maximalists”.
During the period of the Stolypin reaction, the S.
R.
Party was plunged into total ideological and organisational disarray.
During the years of the First World War, most S.
R.
s adopted social-chauvinist attitudes.
After the victory of the February 1917 bourgeois-democratic revolution, the S.
R.
s joined the Mensheviks as the mainstay o f t h e counter-revolutionary bourgeois-landowner Provisional Government, and their leaders (Kerensky, Avksentyev and Chernov) were members of the government.
The S.
R.
Party refused to sup-port the peasant demand for eliminating the landed estates andcame out in favour of preserving them.
S.
R.
Ministers of the Provisional Government dispatched punitive expeditions against peasants seizing landed estates.
At the end of November 1917, the Left wing of the S.
R.
s formed an independent Left S.
R.
Party.
In an effort to retain their influence among the peasant masses, the Left S.
R.
s gave nominal recogni-tion to the Soviet power and entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks, but soon began to fight against the Soviet Govern-ment.
During the years of the foreign military intervention and the Civil War, the S.
R.
s engaged in counter-revolutionary subversive activity and gave active support to the interventionists and white-guards, taking part in counter-revolutionary plots, and organising terrorist acts against the leaders of the Soviet state and the Com-munist Party.
After the Civil War, the S.
R.
s continued their hostile activity against the Soviet state at home and among the whiteguard émigrés abroad.

53 45Narodism—a petty-bourgeois trend in the Russian revolutionary movement which emerged in the 1860s and 1870s.
The Narodniks worked to overthrow the autocracy and hand the landed estates over to the peasants.
At the same time, they denied that capitalist relations were naturally developing in Russia and so believed the peasantry and not the proletariat, to be the chief revolutionary force; they regarded the village commune as the embryo of socialism.
Their tactics—individual acts of terrorism—could not and did not bring them success; they failed equally in their efforts to revolu-tionise the peasantry by spreading the ideas of utopian socialism.
In the 1880s-1890s, the Narodniks were prepared to accept the tsarist regime; they expressed the interests of the kulaks and fought Marxism tooth and claw.

131 72While working on “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’”, Lenin made use of material from an article by the German economist K.
Klawki, “Ueber Konkurrenzfähigkeit des land-wirtschaftlichen Kleinbetriebes” (“The Competitive Capacity of Small-Scale Production in Agriculture”) which appeared in Thiel’s Landwirtschaftliche Jahrbücher (Thiel’s Agricultural Yearbooks), Bd.
XXVIII, Berlin, 1899.
Klawki’s article gives a description of 12 typical German farms (four each of the large, medium and small) operating in similar conditions.
Lenin made a thorough examination of and critically reworked the data given in the article, which was a detailed inquiry but did not provide the necessary generalisations and correct conclusions.
The data from Klawki’s article were used by Lenin mainly in Chapter VI, “The Productivity of a Small and a Big Farm.
An Example from East Prussia” (present edition, Vol.
5, pp.
167-81).
Lenin showed the groundlessness of Bulgakov’sattempts to use Klawki’s article to back up the bourgeois theory that small farms were superior to large farms.
The scientific treatment of the data given in Klawki’s inquiries, says Lenin, confirms the technical superiority of big farms and shows that the small farmer is overworked and underfed, being gradually de-graded to day labourer or farm-hand on the large farm; Lenin shows that as the number of small farms grows there is a spread of poverty and proletarisation among the peasantry.
Lenin’s conclusions, drawn after a thorough examination and reworking of the data in Klawki’s article, are borne out by the mass data on peasant farms in Germany.
In contrast to Klawki who failed to go into the substance of economic processes and ignored the comparative analysis of different groups of farms (basing his conclusions on indiscriminate averages), Lenin gave a profound Marxist analysis of the development of peasant farms under capitalism and brought out their various types.
On the strength of these data, Lenin drew up a summarised table (see present edition, Vol.
5, p.
170).
As a result of his careful verification and scientific tabulation of the data in Klawki’s article, Lenin showed that the latter was wrong in calculating the comparative incomes on large and small farms.
Lenin said the unscientific methods used by Klawki to show the superiority of the small farms were, in their main features practised by all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois economists.
That is why an examination of all these methods, as exemplified by Klawki’s inquiry, is of great interest.
Lenin took the concrete statistical data with which Klawki operated to expose the false methods used in the processing and employment of statistical data, and also the completely unfounded conclusions drawn by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois economists concerning the laws governing agricultural development under capitalism.
p.
148 73Landwirtschaftliche benutzte Fläche—cultivated farmland.
In his preparatory material, Lenin uses the term in most cases without translating it into the Russian, and includes in it farmland in the strict sense of the term (that is, land under crops, meadows and best pastures) and also orchards, vegetable gardens and vineyards.
In some cases, Lenin translates this term as “farmland” (see p.
192).
On p.
358, Lenin indicates that the German source substituted the term “Ueberhaupt landwirtschaftliche Fläche” for “landwirtschaft-liche benutzte Fläche” to designate the same data.

p.
17883 The present volume contains a part of Lenin’s remarks on the Baden Inquiry.
The extracts from the Baden Inquiry are preparatory material for Chapter VII, “The Inquiry into Peasant Farming in Baden”, in “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” in which extensive use of the data is made for an analysis and character-istic of the class stratification of the peasantry under capitalism.
Lenin said the materials of the Baden Inquiry made it possible to distinguish and bring out different groups of peasants.
However, the authors failed to give any scientific grouping of peasant farms; instead of comparing the various groups of farms, they compared whole communities.
This method of using indiscriminate averages, thereby glossing over the class distinctions within the peasantry was used by the “critics of Marx” in the agrarian question.
Lenin gave a scientific characteristic of the class structure of the German countryside and for that purpose used the summarised data of the Baden Inquiry.
He brought out three typical economic groups: the large-, the middle-and the small-peasant farms, and to do this he processed and analysed statistical data relating to 31 large 21 medium and 18 small farms.
For the three typical groups of peasant farms, Lenin determined the average size of landholding, the average size of family and employment of hired labour, and also the results of economic operations in the form of net profit.
In working out the data on landholdings and net profit, Lenin gave two calculation variants for all the 70 farms, and for the group minus the 10 farms in the three communities which had exceptionally large holdings.
This method of bringing out typical phenomena, with a simultaneous verification of conclusions on the data for the whole aggregate of phenomena, is of great importance for statistical methods.
As a result of his economic analysis, Lenin showed that the big-peasant farms using hired labour, permanent and casual, and obtaining the highest net profit per farm, were entrepreneurial and capitalist.
Meanwhile, the small-peasant farms were hardly managing to make ends meet.
On the strength of the scientifically processed data of the Baden Inquiry on the quantity of the key products consumed by the groups of peasant farms, Lenin showed that the small peasant was cutting back his consumption which was well below that of the middle and the big peasant.
If the small peasant spent as much on cash products as the middle peas-ant did, he would run up a great debt and the middle peasant would also incur a debt if he spent as much as the big one.
According to this, Lenin drew the conclusion that the “‘net profit’, not only of the small peasant, but also of the middle peasant is a pure fiction” (see present edition, Vol.
5, p.
185).
In this way Lenin exposed the false method used by the “critics of Marx” to understate the plight of the small peasants, their malnutrition and ruin.
On the strength of his analysis of the Baden Inquiry, Lenin concluded that the main features of the peasant economy in Ger-many were similar to those in Russia, and that the process of capi-talist development was leading to the formation of a minorityof capitalist farms operating with hired labour, and forcing the majority of peasants increasingly to seek subsidiary employment, that is, to become wage workers.
“The differentiation of the peasantry,” Lenin wrote, “reveals the profoundest contradictions of capitalism in the very process of their inception and their further development.
A complete evaluation of these contradictions inevitably leads to the recognition of the small peasantry’s blind alley and hopeless position (hopeless, outside the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat against the entire capitalist system)” (see present edition, Vol.
5, p.
190).
In this way, Lenin showed the economic basis for the common interests of the working class and the small peasantry, and the need for their alliance in the struggle against capitalism.
The material Lenin obtained as a result of his work on the Baden Inquiry, apart from its great political and economic importance, was also of major methodological importance for an understanding of the methods Lenin used to process and apply statistical data in Marxist economic analysis (for instance, the use of scientifically tabulated statistical groupings of peasant farms, determination and use on their basis of differentiated averages for income, consumption, etc.
, by class groups of peas-ants).
Lenin’s methods for processing statistical data are a valu-able contribution to the methodology of Marxist statistics.
p.
180 84The extracts of data on 70 budgets mentioned here are a big table entitled “Summary of Data on 70 budgets from the Baden Inquiry”, which included the statistical data from the Baden Inquiry proc-essed by Lenin.
These extracts made in a notebook are at the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism under the C.

U.
Central Committee.
When tabulating these data for large-, middle-and small-peasant farms, Lenin determined the average landholdings, size of family, and current receipts and outlays (showing the major items) and calculated the surplus or deficit by comparing the receipts and outlays.
In addition, the table contains the indicators on labour (such as the expenditure of labour per hectare, hired labour, showing day labour separately), and also data on subsidiary earnings, etc.
For an analysis of these data see present edition, Vol.

181 85The text of Chapters VII and IX (as first published in the journal Obrazovaniye No.
2, 1906) of “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” shows that in that work Lenin intended to exam-ine French agricultural statistics and to give a critical analysis of the works of French economists.
Judging by a note in Chapter IX (see present edition, Vol.
5, p.
215), he made a special study of the state of wine-growing in France.
It is possible, therefore, that he used E.
Seignouret’s book, Essais d’économie sociale et agricole (Essays on Social and Agricultural Economics), to prepare his work “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” in June-Septem-ber 1901.

It shows how Lenin processed the data of the two agricultural censuses in Germany (1882 and 1895), which he used to prepare “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” (mainly chapters VIII and IX).
The notebook dates to the first period of Lenin’s writing of this work (1900-01).
It con-tains some later extracts made by Lenin from the German agri-cultural census of 1907 in Statistik des Deutschen Reichs, Band 212, Teil 1a.
—Berufs-und Betriebszählung vom 1.
Juni 1907.
Landwirt-schaftliche Betriebsstatistik, Berlin, 1909 and Band 212, Teil 2a, 1910 (Statistics of the German Reich, Vol.

—Census of Occupations and Enterprises of June 12, 1907.
Statistics of Agri-cultural Enterprises, Berlin, 1909, and Vol.
212, part 2a, 1910).
Lenin made these additions in 1910 for a work on German agri-culture.
Lenin used the German agricultural statistics to show that the “critics” of Marx’s economic doctrine were wrong when they said that in the West large farms were being supplanted by the middle-and small-peasant farms.
Having reworked the German agrarian statistics, Lenin showed two processes of proletarisation of the peasantry: first, more and more peasants were being deprived of their land which meant that farmers were being transformed into landless labourers; second, the peasants were increasingly dependent on subsidiary earnings, that is, there was a growing integration of agriculture and industry, which marked the first stage of proletarisation.
Lenin’s treatment of German agrarian statistics sets a model for the scientific analysis and processing of statistical data.
Lenin did not stop at grouping farms under one head (say, area), but went on to classify them under several heads, such as number of agricultural machines, area under special crops, etc.
, and used combined groupings, e.
g.
, dividing each group (say, acreage) into subgroups by quantity of cattle and other characteristics.
Lenin found that he had to rework and verify the statistical data he made use of; he reworked a number of tables (such as that charac-terising the concentration of commercial gardening, etc.
), widening the intervals between the groups of farms to find the more typical, and at the same time bringing out the latifundia connected with industries (sugar refining, wine-making, etc.
).
Lenin calculated the percentages showing for instance, the share of separate groups of farms, determined the absolute averages showing the use of the major types of agricultural machines per 100 farms in each group of farms (grouped by acreage), etc.
p.
189 87Lenin summarised these data on land concentration in wine-growing on the basis of the preceding table.
The left column offigures denotes the grouping of farms, the right column, the cor-responding grouping of land for these farms.
The first pair of figures relates to vineyards under 20 ares; the second, to vine-yards of 20 to 50 ares; the third, to vineyards of 50 ares-5 hectares and over.
p.
192 88Lenin examines the data on the number of cows on various farms in 1895 to characterise the concentration of cattle on the large farms.
The total number of farms and the total number of cows on all farms of all three groups are given in the manuscript at the top of the table (for lack of space below).

In addition, the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism under the C.
P.
S.
U.
Central Committee has unpublished preparatory material relating to French agricultural statistics, which contains summaries and extracts from various sources.
Among them are, above all, the collections Statistique agricole de la France.
Résultats généraux de l’enquête décennale de 189 (Agricultural Statistics of France.
General Results of the 189 Decennial Inquiry), Statistique générale de la France.
Résultats statistiques du Dénombrement de 1896 (General Statistics of France.
Statistical Results of the 1896 Census) and also the results of cen-suses for other years.
Lenin also made many statistical extracts with explanations and critical remarks on the following books: K.
Kautsky, Die Agrarfrage (The Agrarian Question); S.
Bulgakov, Capitalism and Agriculture, Vol.
II; F.
Maurice.
L’agriculture et la question sociale.
La France agricole et agraire (Agriculture and the Social Question.
Agricultural and Agrarian France); A.
Souchon, La proprieté paysanne.
Étude d’économie rurale (Peasant Property.
An Essay on Agricultural Economy); N.
Kudrin, The Peasant Question in France; The Bulletin of the Labour Bureau for 1901, etc.
Most of the extracts from French statistics are summarised data, in particular, groupings of farms by acreage for various years.
Lenin notes as a positive aspect of the French statistics the separate classification of the “active” (that is, the gainfully employed) population, and makes extensive extracts of data by categories within the “active” population.
Lenin takes the same data from the above-mentioned book by Maurice and makes a com-parison of similar statistical data taken from various sources; he characterises these sources and draws conclusions on the annual changes in the numerical strength and share of each group (cate-gory) of the “active” population.
This material from French agricultural statistics, reworked and summarised by Lenin, added up to a comprehensive picture of various aspects of farming among different class groups of peas-ant farms, confirming the Marxist propositions concerning the superiority of large farms and the growth of their role, and the proletarisation of the small peasants.
p.
21890This summarised table was compiled by Lenin on the strength of the statistics of the countries concerned for the corresponding years.
The separate data on Germany, Britain and the United States were taken from the Statistik des Deutschen Reichs, Band 112; some of the data on France, from the same source, and others, from the Statistique agricole de la France.

The results of this inquiry into 95 communities differed from similar inquiries in other countries in failing to provide full data, and, as Lenin remarked, failing to give summa-ries for all communities.
But Lenin managed to extract interest-ing data from this source to characterise various groups of farms (typical communities) and also groups of farms (within separate communities) classified by area, the number of labourers and farm-hands, the number of horses and other characteristics.
These data showed the capitalist nature of Dutch farming.
p.
227 92Lenin intended to give a critique of E.
Stumpfe’s views on large-and small-scale production in agriculture in a number of his works (see this volume, pp.
42, 49, 70), in view of the fact that many of the “critics of Marx” referred to Stumpfe’s works.

Fischer’s work, Die sociale Bedeutung der Maschinen in der Landwirtschaft (The Social Importance of Machinery in Agriculture) was studied by Lenin before Stumpfe’s article “Ueber die Kon-kurrenzfähigkeit des kleinen und mittleren Grundbesitzes gegenüber dem Grossgrundbesitze” (“On the Competitiveness of Small and Medium Land Holdings as Compared with Large Land Holdings”).
In his extracts from this article, Lenin mentions Fischer’s work as having been studied by him (see p.
238).
p.
248 94Lenin’s remark at the end of the text “No wonder its pages remain uncut (at the British Museum)” warrants the assumption that Lenin studied Turot’s book during his stay in London, where Iskra was then being published, that is, not earlier than April 1902.
In London, Lenin made a study of the agrarian question in connection with the working out of the Party’s agrarian pro-gramme; before giving his lectures and talk in Paris (in February-March 1903), he studied the French agricultural economy.
Turot’s book is also mentioned in Lenin’s notes on the book by E.
Lecou-teux (see Lenin Miscellany XXXII, p.
381).
p.
257 95Lenin first mentioned Baudrillart in his extracts from Hertz’s book The Agrarian Questions in Relation to Socialism (June-Sep-tember 1901).
In his plans for “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” Lenin refers to Baudrillart from mention of him by Hertz and Bulgakov.
In the outlines of his lectures on “Marxist Views of the Agrarian Question in Europe and Russia” (1903, before February 10 (23)), Lenin refers to Baudrillart’s works as having been studied by him earlier.

” p.
262 99In his lectures, “Marxist Views of the Agrarian Question in Europe and Russia”, and in his talks in Paris, Lenin mentions Nossig as one of “many writers who sympathise with the criticism of the Marxist theory rather than with this theory itself”.
He adds: “Their own data speak against them” (see present edition, Vol.
6, p.
345).
Notes on the manuscript indicate that Lenin repeatedly returned to it.
Thus, some words are retraced in blue pencil, appar-ently to make for easier reading; the translation of some words is given in plain pencil in brackets.

263100Lenin read E.
David’s book, Socialismus and Landwirtschaft (Socialism and Agriculture) soon after it was published.
In a letter to G.
V.
Plekhanov on March 15, 1903, Lenin wrote: “I had already ordered David’s book and am now reading it.
Terribly watery, poor and trite” (present edition, Vol.
34, p.
150).
In an article entitled “Les beaux esprits se rencontrent (Which May Be Inter-preted Roughly as: Birds of a Feather Flock Together)” (which was published in Iskra No.
38, April 15, 1903) Lenin criticised the main propositions of David’s book (see present edition, Vol.
6, pp.
431-33).
Lenin gave a full-scale critique of David’s book—“the principal work of revisionism on the agrarian question”—in Chapter X of “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” (present edition, Vol.
13, pp.
171-82).

Lenin must have made these extracts at the Geneva Library in the autumn of 1904.
The following reference is noted on the second page of the manu-script: “See examples on separate sheet.

70).
Lenin used some of the material published here in a footnote to Chapter VI, “The Productivity of a Small and a Big Farm.
An Example from East Prussia”, in the 1908 edition of “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” (see present edition, Vol.
5, p.
179).
He said he hoped “to return to Herr Huschke’s interesting book” (ibid.
).
p.
287 107This is a notebook on the cover of which is written: “German Agrarian Statistics (1907)” and on top of that, in coloured pencil: “ 1 ) German agrarian statistics, “2) Russian agrarian statistics, “3) Statistics on strikes in Russia & Hungarian agrarian statistics.
” Lenin’s study of the German agricultural census of 1907 relates to the period from 1910 (before September) to 1913 (after June).
Lenin attached special importance to an analysis of German agrarian statistics in studying the laws governing the develop-ment of capitalism in agriculture and in exposing bourgeois apolo-getics in the agrarian question.
“Germany belongs to the leading and most rapidly developing capitalist countries.
Her censuses of agricultural enterprises are possibly on a higher level than anywhere else in Europe.
It is understandable therefore why German and Russian writers displayed such interest in the results of the latest census of 1907 (the first and the second censuses were taken in 1882 and in 1895).
Bourgeois economists and revisionists sing out in chorus that Marxism—for the hundredth and thousandth time!—has been refuted by the data of the census” (see Lenin Miscellany XXV, p.
127).
That is why Lenin believed that it was necessary to make a detailed analysis of the German census of 1907.
The material of German agrarian statistics was taken mainly from the three volumes of the collection Statistik des DeutschenReichs.

This statistical material, like that which follows, was partially used by Lenin in the writing of his article “The Capitalist System of Modern Agriculture” (see present edition, Vol.
16, pp.
423-46).
Lenin also planned to use the material of German agrarian sta-tistics in another article on German agriculture.
The material of German agrarian statistics contains numerous extracts from tables, parts of tables and separate statistical data not only from the above-mentioned collection, Statistics of the German Reich, but also from articles by Zahn, Schmelzle and others.
Some data on fertilisers were taken from French sources.
The material of German agrarian statistics which Lenin proc-essed and systematised illustrated various forms of capitalist development in agriculture.
On the strength of the extensive statistical data on the agricultur-al population contained in German agrarian statistics, Lenin studied the proletarisation of the peasantry.
The data on the use of machinery, the percentage of farms with draught cattle, and the composition of the draught animals, the growth of agricultural industries, dairy farming, etc.
, showed the development of large-scale capitalist production.
Special interest attaches to Lenin’s explanations to the table (taken from the results of the 1907 Census in Volume 202 of the Statistics of the German Reich) which classifies the population by main occupation of the gainfully employed (see pp.
342-45, 370).
The principle of classifying the rural population of Germany, according to the data for 1882 and 1895, into three main groups (I, II and III) was described and substantiated by Lenin in his work “The Agrarian Question and the ‘Critics of Marx’” (present edition, Vol.
5, pp.
217-22) which is indicated on p.
346 (“Distribu-tion (in thousands) adopted in The Agrarian Question, p.

369 114This plan reflects the three stages of Lenin’s work on the material based on his study of the data of the 1907 German agricultural census and collected in notebook, German Agrarian Statistics (see pp.
297-371).
The first stage was the compilation of a general plan for the processing of these data under 13 heads (0-12).
The second stage was the drawing up of the plan and the writing of the first article, “The Capitalist System of Modern Agriculture”, in which Lenin dealt with the first five (0-4) points of the general plan (see present edition, Vol.
16, pp.
423-46).
The other points remained for an-other article.
The third stage was the drafting of the plan for another article consisting of the five points or topics.
This article was never written.
The time it took Lenin to work on the plan as a whole is deter-mined by the time it took him to collect the material on German agrarian statistics on the basis of the 1907 Census, that is, from 1910 to 1913.
p.

423-46), which was written on the basis of this plan.
The Roman numer-als (from I to VII) designate the chapters of the article, the Arabic numerals (from 1 to 87), boxed and in round brackets, the pages of the manuscript of the article.

Tables 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are on pages of the manuscript which have not been found.
p.
375 120Extracts of data from Danish statistics date approximately to 1911, a fact established from the date of the latest of the Danish statistical publications quoted here by Lenin, The Statistical Tables for the 1909 Census.
Lenin took down the data to show the concentration of capital and production in Danish agriculture.
He tabulated all the farms into four big groups (under 3.
3 ha—proletarian and semi-prole-tarian farms 3.
3 to 9.
9 ha—small peasants; 9.
9 to 29.
7 ha—big peasants and peasant bourgeoisie; and over 29.
7 ha—capitalist p.
373agriculture) to show the distinction between the economic types of farms.
The two lower groups (63.
4 per cent of all farms) had, in 1909, 11.
7 per cent of the land and 17.
2 per cent of the big horned cattle; and the two higher groups (36.
6 per cent of all farms) had 88.
2 per cent of the land and 82.
8 per cent of all horned cattle.
This revealed the typical capitalist stratification of farms and the concentration on the entrepreneurial farms of almost 90 per cent of the land and more than 80 per cent of the big horned cattle.
Lenin makes special mention of the increase in the number of large farms from 1898 to 1909.
In that period, the total number of farms increased by 1.
7 per cent, while farms with 15-49 head of big horned cattle went up by 35 per cent, and those with 50 and more head, by 46.
3 per cent.
Lenin used the data on the com-parative quantities of horned cattle in Denmark, Germany and Russia per 1,000 population, per 1,000 hectares, and per square kilometre to show the high level of livestock farming in Denmark.

376 121The extracts from Austrian agricultural statistics apparently date to the period from 1910 to 1912, for Volume 28 of Öesterrei-chisches Statistisches Handbuch (The Austrian Statistical Handbook) mentioned by Lenin in the beginning was issued in 1910, and Volume 29, mentioned in a later addition on the same page of the manuscript, was published not earlier than November 1911 (the Preface to the volume was dated October 1911).
The materials on Austrian agricultural statistics contain mainly data characterising area, personnel in agricultural and forest enter-prises, the use of agricultural machinery and the maintenance of draught animals.
The characteristic of agricultural and forest enterprises in respect of the area of cultivated land and the use of agricultural machinery is given as a statistical grouping in the form of a combined table reflecting the interconnection between the two.
The second half of the table (see p.
385) was compiled by Lenin from a number of tables in the said collection with the view to further dividing up the medium group of farms (2-100 ha) into 5 subgroups by area.
The grouping of agricultural and forest enterprises by productive area (see pp.
388-95) classifies the enterprises with regard to hired labour, Lenin obtained the statistical data on strictly family farms and on farms with persons not belonging to the family by reworking the data of Table 6 from the collection Öesterreichische Statistik.
The material on Austrian statistics illustrated the development of capitalism in agriculture and was apparently intended by Lenin for use in later works on the agrarian question.

Laur’s book date approximately to 1913, since they were made by Lenin between two entries dating to 1913.
Lenin made use of the statistical data from 1886 to 1906, which enabled him to give a comprehensive characteristic of tendencies in the development of Swiss agriculture in that period.
Together with other material, these data were apparently intended by Lenin for a continuation of his work, New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture.

p.
406 128The documents published below are preparatory material for Lenin’s New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture.
Part One.
Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America.
This material consists of two parts: the first contains diverse variants of the plan for this work, and the second, statistical material from the American censuses taken in 1900 and 1910.
“Remarks on American Agricultural Statistics” is an introduction to this statistical material (see pp.
416-20).
Lenin wrote the variants of the plan on the back of sheets con-taining his article, in German, “Der Opportunismus und derZusammenbruch der zweiten Internationale” (“Opportunism and the Collapse of the Second International”) (see present edition, Vol.
22, pp.
108-20).
The sheets are not numbered, so that the variants of the plan are arranged as they approximate the final plan given in the contents of the published book.
Apart from complete variants of the plan, there are fragments of it on the same sheets.
“Remarks on American Agricultural Statistics” contain impor-tant methodological propositions on the study of types of farms and comparative characteristics of farm groupings under three heads: area, principal source of income, and gross cash income.
Lenin emphasises the importance of grouping farms under the last two heads, and shows the limits of application and the short-comings of the grouping by area alone, for it glosses over the displacement of small-scale production (lumping together a mino-rity of growing farms with a mass of backward farms going to seed).
In Lenin’s grouping of farms by income, the land factor is subordinate to capital.
The specific feature of Lenin’s methodo-logy in this case was the grouping (in a combined table) by two factors, which resulted in a comparison of the statistical data on farm area within the limits of one type of farm.
Lenin believed the insufficient use of combined tables to be a flaw in American statistics, which failed to use combined tables showing type of farms (they gave 7-10 groups of farms, which Lenin reduced to three main groups, corresponding to three types of farm).
On the 1900 Census Lenin wrote: “.
.
.
here too, no classification gives all the essential characteristics of the type and size of farm” (present edition, Vol.
22, p.
61).
The second part of the preparatory material—”American Agrar-ian Statistics”—consists of the statistical data of the two American censuses taken in 1900 and 1910 processed by Lenin.
They are: Census Reports.
Volume V.
Twelfth Census of the United States, taken in the year 1900.
Agriculture.
Part 1.
Washington 1902, and Thirteenth Census of the United States, taken in the year 1910.
Volume V.
Agriculture.
1909 and 1910.
Washington, 1914.
On the back of the first three pages of extracts from the Thirteenth Census of 1910, there are extracts from Volume IV of the same census (Statistics of Occupations).
In addition, there are some data drawn from the Statistical Abstract of the United States.
Washington, 1912.
Lenin starts by giving a list of the extracts from the 1900 Census.
The extracts from the Twelfth Census of 1900 take up 12 numbered pages (with certain phrases or words given in bold type or under-lined), and those from the Thirteenth Census of 1910, 16 pages.
In addition, there are several separate sheets with various cal-culations made by Lenin (e.
g.
, the percentage of farms reporting horses in 1900-10).
The results of these calculations are given in Lenin’s New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture (see present edition, Vol.
22, pp.
9 1 -9 2 ) .
Of the greatest value in Lenin’s study and demonstration of capitalist development in general, and the displacement of small-scale by large-scale production in industry and agriculture, in particular, was the material of the Twelfth Census of 1900, which yielded the three different methods of grouping farms (by principal source of income, by acreage, and by value of the farm product— gross cash income).
But here, as was noted above, none of the groupings is fully applied in respect of all the essential characteris-tics of the type and size of farm.
In the results of the 1910 census, Lenin pointed out, even the traditional grouping of farms by acreage was not given in full.
Lenin filled these gaps: he drew up a comprehensive (summary) table giving a comparison of the three groupings.
In his analysis, Lenin showed that grouping by acreage (a method favoured by bourgeois statisticians) was limit-ed and insufficient, and proved the need to modify the methods of inquiry, grouping, etc.
, in accordance with the forms of capi-talist penetration into agriculture.
As has been said, the material of the Thirteenth Census of 1910 was poorer in content, so that Lenin was unable to make the same groupings, analyse them and draw the relevant conclusions.
He made use of the absolute and part of relative data of the 1910 Census for a comparison.
On pp.
442-45 of this volume, apart from data on agriculture, he gives data on population in the three main divisions of the United States: the industrial North, the former slave-holding South, and the homestead West; for these three main divisions Lenin wrote out data characterising the commercial character of livestock farming, notably, the concentration of livestock owned in the North.
Lenin arrives at a general conclu-sion for the country as a whole that small and medium farms are being supplanted, and that large capitalist farms are growing.
Further, on pp.
478-79 there are statistical data which Lenin used to refute the assertions of bourgeois economists that the law of the large-scale production supplanting the small-scale does not apply to agriculture.
These data served as the basis for §15 (“A Com-parative Picture of Evolution in Industry and Agriculture”) of Lenin’s New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capitalism in Agriculture.
He arrives at the conclusion that “there is a remarkable similarity in the laws of evolution” in industry and agriculture.
Lenin began to work on the American 1900 statistics in Paris (in 1912), but did not finish working on this volume.
In a letter to Isaac A.
Hourwich, Washington, from Cracow on February 27, 1914, Lenin wrote: “When I made a study of American agri-cultural statistics (Vol.
V.
Agriculture—Census of 1900) in Paris, I found a great deal of interesting matter.
Now, in Cracow, I am unable to obtain these publications” (see present edition, Vol.
36, p.
271).
In a letter from Poronin to N.
N.
Nakoryakov in New York on May 18, 1914, he said he had received Volume V of the 1900 Census and asked for Volume V of the Thirteenth Census of 1910 (see present edition, Vol.
35, p.
140).
New Data on the Laws Governing the Development of Capital-ism in Agriculture.
Part One.
Capitalism and Agriculture in the United States of America (see present edition, Vol.
22, pp.
13-102) was apparently completed in 1915, and in January 1916 sent from Berne to Maxim Gorky for Parus Publishers.
In a letter he sent at the same time, Lenin wrote: “I have tried in as popular a form as possible to set forth new data about America which, I am convinced, are particularly suitable for the popularising of Marxism and substantiating it by means of facts.
.
.
.
I should like to continue, and subsequently also to publish, a second part— about Germany” (see present edition, Vol.
35, p.
212).
The book was first published in 1917 by Zhizn i Znaniye Publishers.
