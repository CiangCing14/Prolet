DUTY 463 495 623PREFACE Volume Forty-Two contains items written after the Octo-ber Revolution, which were first published in the Complete Russian Edition of Lenin’s Collected Works or which were published in Lenin Miscellanies, magazines and newspapers.
These documents form an important supplement to the works included in the various volumes of this edition.
The first group of documents dates to the period from November 1917 to July 1918—the period of continued development of the socialist revolution and consolidation of Soviet power.
Mention should be made first of all of “Theses on the Tasks of the Party & the Present Situation”, the article “Plekhanov on Terror”, the “Draft Resolution for the C.
C.
, R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
) Concerning the Expulsion from the Party of S.
A.
Lozovsky”, the “Outline of a Pro-gramme of Economic Measures” and a number of chapters of the original version of the article “The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government”.
These deal with the tasks that faced the working class after the conquest of power, stress the necessity for strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat and suppressing the resistance of the overthrown exploiting classes, and sharply criticise the Right-opportunist elements within the Party.
Several documents relate to Lenin’s fight to get Russia out of the war, to conclude the Brest peace treaty (“Speech at a Joint Meeting of the Bolshevik and Left S.
R.
Groups in the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, February 19, 1918”, “Speech to the Lettish Riflemen, February 20, 1918” and others).
The numerous decisions for the Council of People’s Commissars drafted by Lenin reflect the first steps of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government in the field of political, economic and cultural activities.
A large part of the materials relate to the period of foreign military intervention and the civil war, among them: notes on “The Tasks and Organisation of the Work of the Council of Defence”, “Notes at a Meeting of the Commission on Cartridges”, “Draft Resolution for the C.
C R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on Sending Groups of Workers Out on Food Transportation Jobs”, “Draft Decision for the Council of Defence on the Mobilisation of Soviet Employees”, “Draft Decisions for the C.
C.
Politbureau on Measures to Fight Mamontov”, “Proposals on Military Questions”, “Decisions of the Politbureau of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on the Order of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Western Front” and Lenin’s speeches: “Speech to Ivanovo-Voznesensk Communist Workers Leaving for the Front, October 24, 1919”, “Speech at the Eleventh Issue of Red Commanders of the First Moscow Machine-Gunners Training Courses, May 12, 1920”, “Report on the Internal and External Position of the Republic at a Meeting of Activists of the Moscow Organisation of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
), October 9, 1920”.
These and many other documents strikingly illustrate the gigantic activities of the Central Committee and the Soviet Government, headed by Lenin, in organising the defeat of the interventionists and whiteguards.
A considerable part of the volume is made up of items and documents written after the war, when the problems of economic rehabilitation and socialist construction bulked large.
Industry, agriculture, science and technology, public education, improvement of the machinery of state, the national question, foreign policy—all these problems were dealt with daily by Lenin, who directed the activities of the Party and the Government The items included in this volume contain important supplementary material showing how Lenin worked on the plan of socialist construction.
Of great significance are the chapters of the original version of “The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government” (the end of Chapter IV, chapters V-IX and the beginning of Chapter X) which were first published in 1962.
In these chapters Lenin sets forth in greater detail than in the final text a number of questions relating to the task of starting construction of a new society and reveals the importanceof solving economic problems and the need for proper management of the national economy during the period of transition from capitalism to socialism.
In interviews given to Lincoln Eyre, correspondent of the American newspaper The World, and to the correspondent of the Japanese newspaper Osaka Asahi and in his “Notes on Electrification” Lenin characterises the role of electrification in building the economic foundation of socialism and devel-oping the productive forces.
Questions of the New Economic Policy are dealt with in the “Reply to the Debate on the Report on Concessions” at the meeting of the Communist group of the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions on April 11, 1921, in speeches made at the Tenth All-Russia Conference of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) during the debate on the resolution on questions of the New Economic Policy, and in a letter “To the Russian Colony in North America”.
Consistent application of democratic centralism in running the economy, scientific planning, rational and efficient management, proper organisation of labour, the introduction of cost accounting, the running of enterprises on a paying basis, and the use of moral and material incentives for developing production were considered by Lenin to be the most vital principles and methods of socialist manage-ment.
Mention can here be made of such documents as the “Speech at a Meeting of the Presidium of the S.
E.
C.
, April 1, 1918”, “Comments on the Draft ‘Regulations for the Management of the Nationalised Enterprises’”, “Salaries for Specialists”, “Addendum to the Draft Regulations on Subbot-niks”, “Draft of the Main Point of the C.
L.
D.
Decision on the General Planning Commission”, “Plan of an Article ‘Commercial Organisation’”, “Motion to the Politbureau of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on Bonuses for Enterprises” and others.
Defining the tasks of economic construction in his “Plan of a Speech at the Trade Union Congress”, Lenin wrote: “Work discipline, higher labour productivity, work organi-sation, increased output, relentless fight against slipshod work and red tape.
By this sign shall ye conquer” (p.
308).
Materials such as: “Addendum to the Draft Decision for the C.
P.
C.
‘On the Distribution of Agricultural Machines’”, “Draft Decision for the C.
L.
D.
on Fowler Ploughs”, the draft decision on “Measures for Improving the Organisationof State Farms” and others show Lenin’s concern for the revival of agriculture, for the supply of the peasants with machines, for the development of the state farms, for support of the co-operatives on the part of the state and for the creation of conditions for the socialist transformation of the village.
A number of materials deal with questions of cultural development: the draft decision for the C.
P.
C.
on “Library Organisation”, “Instructions for Compiling a Reading Book for Workers and Peasants”, “Draft Decision for the Polit-bureau of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on the Chief Committee for Political Education”, “Rough Draft of a Resolution on Proletarian Culture”, “Addendum to the Draft Decision for the C.
P.
C.
on an Obligatory Science Minimum in the Higher Schools”, “Draft Decision for the Plenum of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on the Reorganisation of the People’s Commis-sariat for Education”, “Directives on the Film Business”.
These and other documents contain important propositions regarding the substance and ways of effecting a cultural revolution, the communist education of the working people, the political enlightenment of the masses.
Of exceptionally great significance is the letter “On the Establishment of the U.
S.
S.
R.
” in which Lenin put forward the idea of creating a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a single multinational socialist state based on a voluntary association of equal and sovereign Soviet Republics.
Questions concerning the national policy of the Communist Party and the Soviet Government are dealt with also in the “Notes at a Meeting of Delegates to the Second All-Russia Congress of Communist Organisations of the Peoples of the East”, “Draft Decision for the Politbureau of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on the Tasks of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) in Turkestan”, “Draft Decision for the Politbureau of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on the Tasks of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) in Localities Inhabited by Eastern Peoples” and other items, in which Lenin urges the need for unity and fraternal co-operation among all the nationalities of the Soviet land and for waging a vigorous fight against chauvinism and nationalism.
The speech winding up the debate on the report on con-cessions at the meeting of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) group at the Eighth Congress of Soviets contains Lenin’s important thesis onSoviet patriotism: “The patriotism of a person who is prepared to go hungry for three years rather than surrender Russia to foreigners is genuine patriotism, without which we could not hold out for three years.
Without this patriotism we would not have succeeded in defending the Soviet Repub-lic, in doing away with private property.
.
.
.
This is the finest revolutionary patriotism” (p.
245).
In his note “The Democratism and Socialist Nature of Soviet Power” and his “Speech at a Meeting in Presnya District, July 26, 1918”, Lenin characterises the Soviets and reveals the genuine democratism of the Soviet Consti-tution.
Many documents reflect Lenin’s efforts to improve the working of the machinery of state, and strengthen state, Party and public control: “Proposals for the Distribution of Functions Between the Deputy Chairmen of the C.
P.
C.
and the C.
L.
D.
”, “Proposals Concerning the Work Routine of the Deputy Chairmen and the Chairman of the C.
P.
C.
”, “Letter to L.
B.
Kamenev, A.
I.
Rykov and A.
D.
Tsyurupa on the Distribution of Work Between the Deputy Chairmen of the C.
P.
C.
and the C.
L.
D.
”, “Politbureau of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) Directives on a Workers’ Inspection”, “Materials to the Article ‘How We Should Reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection’”, etc.
A number of documents are devoted to the strengthening of socialist legality: “Rough Theses of a Decision on the Strict Observance of the Laws”, “Proposals Concerning the Work of the Vecheka”, “Speech at the Fourth Conference of Gubernia Extraordinary Commis-sions, February 6, 1920” and others.
Lenin regarded the Communist Party as the guiding and directing force of Soviet society.
He never relaxed his efforts to strengthen the ideological and organisational unity of the Party, he urged the need for doing everything to develop inner-Party democracy, to rigidly adhere to the principle of collective leadership and to strengthen the Party’s ties with the masses.
These questions are dealt with in many documents included in this volume: “Speech on the Immediate Tasks of Party Development” at the Ninth All-Russia Conference of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
), draft resolution and proposals for the resolution on this question, speech to the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) group at the Eighth Congress ofSoviets during the debate on the report of the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
and C.
P.
C.
concerning home and foreign policies, “Speech at a Meeting of Moscow Party Activists, February 24, 1921”, “Draft of a Letter of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on the Attitude to Non-Party Workers”, “Outline of a Speech at a Meeting of Supporters of the ‘Platform of Ten’”—delegates to the Tenth Congress of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
), “Remarks Con-cerning the Work Plan of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
)”.
Lenin’s draft resolution for the Politbureau of the C.
C.
con-cerning Maxim Gorky’s articles in the magazine Communist International is a striking illustration of his high-principled attitude, his intolerance towards the cult of personality.
Of great importance is the series of documents dealing with the Soviet state’s foreign policy: the interviews with foreign correspondents, the “Draft Directives to the Deputy Chairman and All Members of the Genoa Delegation”, “Draft Directives of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) for the Soviet Delegation to the Genoa Conference”, “Draft Decision for the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on the Tasks of the Soviet Delegation at Genoa”, “Amendments and Remarks to the Draft Declaration of the Soviet Delegation at the Genoa Conference” and others, which formulate the fundamental principles of the Soviet Republic’s foreign policy and the aims and methods of Soviet diplomacy.
These documents show how consistently the Soviet Government, headed by Lenin, pursued its policy of peace and establishment of business relations with the capitalist countries.
In his interview given to an American correspon-dent, Lenin said: “I know of no reason why a socialistic commonwealth like ours cannot do business indefinitely with capitalistic countries” (p.
177).
At the same time the Soviet Government strongly rebuffed all attempts of the imperialist powers to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet Republic or to impose upon it fettering terms of an economic agreement.
Lenin said: “We have reiterated and reiterated our desire for peace.
.
.
.
But we do not propose to be strangled to death for the sake of peace” (ibid.
).
Notable items in this volume are the documents which reveal the friendly fraternal relations between the Soviet state and the countries where the people had come to power.
This volume contains the draft decisions for the C.
P.
C.
concerning a treaty with the Socialist Workers’ Republic of Finland.
This was the first treaty in history to be signed between two socialist republics, and represented a new type of international relations between equal sovereign states.
The text of Lenin’s “Talk With a Delegation of the Mongolian People’s Republic” contains important guidelines on the paths of development towards socialism for countries with a pre-capitalist social system, and on the specific features of the tactics which the revolutionary parties in these countries should adopt.
The writings included in this volume are a valuable supplement to the well-known works of Lenin dealing with the international labour and communist movements.
Mention should first of all be made of Lenin’s letter to Chicherin (at the end of December 1918) outlining the basic ideological platform and organisational principles of the Communist International.
Of considerable interest are the materials relating to the Second Congress of the Comintern—the “Plan of a Resolution Concerning the Meaning of the Concept ‘Dictatorship of the Proletariat’ and the Fight Against the ‘Fashionable’ Distortion of This Slogan”, “Remarks on the Report of A.
Sultan-Zade Concerning the Prospects of a Social Revolution in the East” and others.
A number of documents deal with the Third Congress of the Comintern and show what a tremendous job Lenin performed in preparing the basic decisions of the Congress and guiding its proceedings.
These include: “Letter to O.
W.
Kuusinen and Remarks on the Draft ‘Theses on the Organisational Activities of the Communist Parties, on the Methods and Contant of Their Work’”, “Remarks on the Draft Theses on Tactics for the Third Congress of the Communist Interna-tional”, “Speeches at a Meeting of Members of the German Polish, Czechoslovak, Hungarian and Italian Delegations”.
These documents reflect the irreconcilable struggle which Lenin carried on against Right-wing opportunism, reformism and revisionism, and at the same time against Leftism, adventurism, dogmatism and sectarianism in the interna-tional communist movement.
They contain very important guidelines on questions of the strategy and tactics of the international communist movement.
The Communist Parties, Lenin emphasised, should focus their attention on the taskof winning over the majority of the working class, the bulk of the working masses, and prepare them for the socialist revolution.
In a number of documents—“Draft Decision of the Politbureau of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on the Tactics of the United Front”, “Letter to Members of the Politbureau of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) with Remarks to the Draft Resolution for the First Extended Plenary Meeting of the Comintern Executive on Participation in a Conference of the Three Internationals”, “Proposal to the Draft Resolution for the Eleventh Party Congress on the Report of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) Delegation in the Comintern”—Lenin argues the case for the tactics of a united front, the adoption of a united action by the working class.
The Appendix to the volume contains questionnaires filled in by Lenin in the capacity of delegate to Communist Party congresses and conferences, in the course of reregistra-tion of members of the Moscow organisation of the R.
C.
P.
and under the All-Russia census of the R.
C.
P.
members.
Of considerable interest are the records of Lenin’s official orders and instructions, reception of visitors and other facts entered in the Journal of Lenin’s Duty Secretaries.
This document reveals how manfully Lenin fought his illness, giving all his strength to the cause of the Party, the cause of the working class.

).
§ 2.

The term rich flat applies to any flat in which the number of rooms equals or exceeds the number of permanent occupants.
The owners of rich flats are obliged immediately, under threat of confiscation of all their property, to draw up in duplicate a statement listing the articles of warm clothing they have and of those supplied by them to the front, one copy of which is to be handed to the House Committee, the other to the district Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.
The owners of rich flats, under similar threat, are obliged immediately to submit in duplicate to the same institutions a statement to the effect that they are vacating one of two rich flats for the needs of the poor population of the capital (that is, two rich families having two rich flats are obliged to move into one of their flats during the winter, giving the other up to the use of the poor population in view of the extreme need created by the war).
The house committees shall immediately draw up lists of rich flats subject to requisition, and the district Soviets of Workers’ Deputies shall endorse these lists and define the conditions and order in which families of the poor population are to move into these flats.

“What do you think of the results of the elections to the Con-stituent Assembly?” the correspondent asked.
“I think that these elections have proved a great victory for the Bolshevik Party.
The number of votes cast for it in the elections in May, August and in September is constantly growing.
4 To get six seats out of twelve in a city in which the bourgeoisie (Cadets 5 ) are strongest, means to win in Russia.
” “Do you suppose that the Constituent Assembly of such composition as the results of the elections in Petrograd indicate will sanction all the measures of the Government of National Commissioners?” “Yes, it will sanction, because there will be no majority, according to your supposition, against us, and together with the left social revolutionists 6 we shall constitute a majority in Petrograd (seven out of twelve).
” “What parties Commissioners?” will enter into the new Council of National “I do not know positively, but I think that only the left social revolutionists, besides the Bolsheviks.

Lenin * Written December 1 9 , 1 9 1 7 (January 1 , 1 9 18) First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXI Printed from the manuscript PLEKHANOV ON TERROR There was a time when Plekhanov was a socialist, a prominent exponent of revolutionary socialism.
At that time—now, alas, in the limbo of forgotten things— Plekhanov expressed his opinion on a subject which happens to have vital significance in the present period.
It happened in 1903, when the Russian Social-Democrats were framing their programme at the Second Party Congress.
The minutes of this Congress contain the following very informative entry, that might have been written specially for the present day: “Posadovsky.
The statements made here for and against the amendments strike me as being not a dispute over details but a serious difference of opinion; without a doubt we disagree on the following fundamental question: should our future policy be governed by certain basic democratic principles, admitted to have absolute value, or are all democratic principles to be governed exclusively by what is profitable for our party? I definitely declare for the latter.
There is no democratic principle that we could not make subservient to the interests of our party.
(Interjection: “Even inviolability of the person?”) Yes! Inviolability of the person as well! As a revolutionary party striving towards its ultimate goal—that of a social revolution—we must regard democratic principles exclusively from the point of view of the speediest possible achievement of that goal, from the point of view of our party’s interests.
If one or another demand does not turn out to our advantage we shall not use it.
“Therefore I oppose any amendments that are likely in future to narrow our freedom of action.
” “Plekhanov.
I fully support what Comrade Posadovsky has said.
Every given democratic principle should be examined not on its own * This document was also signed by J.
V.
Stalin.
—Ed.
merits in the abstract, but in its bearing on what may be called the basic principle of democracy, namely, on the principle that says: salus populi suprema lex * .
Translated into the language of the revolutionary, this means that the success of the revolution is the highest law.
If it were necessary for the success of the revolution to restrict the effect of one or another democratic principle, it would be criminal to stop at such a restriction.
As my own personal opinion I would say that even the principle of universal suffrage should be regarded from the point of view of this basic principle of democracy I have just mentioned.
Hypothetically it is conceivable that we, Social-Democrats, may have occasion to come out against universal suffrage.
The bourgeoisie of the Italian republics once deprived persons belonging to the nobility of political rights.
The revolutionary proletariat could restrict the political rights of the upper classes the way these classes once restricted the political rights of the proletariat.
The fitness of such a measure could only be judged by the rule: salus revolutionis suprema lex.
The same point of view should be adopted by us on the question of the duration of parliaments.
If, on an impulse of revolutionary enthusiasm, the people were to elect a very good parliament, a sort of Chambre Introuv-able, we should try and make it a long parliament; and if the elections turned out to be unfavourable w e s h o u l d t r y a n d d i s m i s s i t n o t i n t w o y e a r s’ t i m e, b u t i f p o s s i b l e i n t w o w e e k s” (Minutes of the Second Congress of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, pp.
168-69).
The enemies of socialism may be deprived for a time not only of inviolability of the person, and not only of freedom of the press, but of universal suffrage as well.
A bad parlia-ment should be “dismissed” in two weeks.
The good of the revolution, the good of the working class, is the highest law.
That was how Plekhanov spoke when he was a socialist.
That was how the great majority of the present-day Mensheviks spoke, those same Mensheviks who are now screaming about “Bolshevik terror”.
The “good of the revolution” now demands a grim fight against saboteurs, organisers of military cadet insurrections, and newspapers run by bankers.
When the Soviet authorities embark upon such struggle, the so-called socialists from the camp of the Mensheviks and S.
R.
s shout from all the house-tops against civil war and terror.
When that Kerensky 24 of yours reintroduced capital punishment at the front, that was not terror, gentlemen, was it? When your coalition cabinet, with the hands of the Kornilovs, 25 machine-gunned whole regiments for showing * The welfare of the people is the highest law.

insufficient enthusiasm for the war, that was not civil war, gentlemen, was it? When those Kerenskys and Avksentyevs 26 of yours threw 3,000 soldiers into a single prison in Minsk for “harmful agitation”, that was not terror, gentlemen, was it? When you suppressed the workers’ newspapers, that was not terror, gentlemen, was it? The only difference is that the Kerenskys, Avksentyevs and Lieberdans, 27 hand in glove with the Kornilovs and Savinkovs, 28 have practised terror against the workers, soldiers and peasants in the interests of a handful of land-owners and bankers, while the Soviet government is taking strong measures against the landowners, marauders and their underlings—in the interests of the workers, soldiers and peasants.

Having concluded peace, we would be able to start putting things in order at home and deepen-ing the socialist revolution, and we would succeed in completing the radical reforms that would bring us nearer to the introduction in Russia of a socialist system.

The worn-out Russian people had to be given peace at all costs.
In doing so we would strengthen the revolution and start building a new young Russia.
In any case, the surren-dered territories would not remain occupied, because the Russian revolution in the near future would spread not only to Germany, but to the other belligerent powers.

P.
C.
MARCH 4, 1918 52 1 I fully agree with Comrade Trutovsky that the tendencies and attempts of which we have heard here are completely at variance with the aims of the workers’ and peasants’ government and have nothing in common with socialism.
53 The aim of socialism is to turn all the means of production into the property of the whole people, and that does not at all mean that the ships become the property of the ship workers or the banks the property of the bank clerks.
If people take such paltry things seriously, then we must do away with nationalisation, 54 because the whole thing is preposterous.
The task, the aim of socialism, as we see it, is to convert the land and the industrial enterprises into the property of the Soviet Republic.
The peasant receives land on condition that he works it properly.
If the river transport workers receive ships, it is on condition that they take a proprietary interest in them: they must submit their estimates if only in order to have income and expendi-ture endorsed, and they must take proper care of the ships.
If they cannot do this, we shall remove them.
Seeing that they have been arguing for three weeks, I would propose removing all of them from the management, because this shows an utter inaptitude for organisation, a complete failure to grasp the vital tasks facing the Soviet Republic.
It is chaos, disorganisation, even worse—it borders on sabotage.
They have started a sort of organised crusade in the Union and come complaining.
Meanwhile, the boats on the Volga stand unrepaired.
What is this? What is it—a mad-house? I am perfectly sure that they realise that if we go on existing in this chaos we shall bring still greater calamities down on our heads.
The chief condition with us is discipline and the organised transfer of all property to the people, the transfer of all sources of wealth to the Soviet Republic, and their strictly disciplined disposal.
So when we are told that the river transport workers will be private managing proprietors, we obviously cannot agree to it.
Soviet poweris to do the managing.
But you organise a sort of debate preventing unity among all organisations.
.
.
.
* If they are dissatisfied, they could have asked for the order to be rescind-ed.
But they are proposing again that it should be decided first whom the ships belong to, so that the ship workers should demand a 140 per cent rise.
2 I fully agree with many things, but as to the make-up of the Board, I think the proposal of the river transport comrades is absolutely unacceptable.
For one thing, that is not the question we are dealing with.
The question at issue is that the men are not receiving their money.
That’s simply scandalous, of course.
What are we allocating money for? For it to remain on paper? We have heard a thousand com-plaints, that unless the money is sent, our transport will collapse.
If the money was assigned on February 21, and on the 22nd it was not received, then they should have come on the 23rd complaining.
We are suffering from a money famine, we are short of currency notes, the treasury cannot print all we need.
If we assign money and you unassign it, then actually nothing is sent.
You should have come here on February 23, and not March 3.
We demanded that these tens of millions should be given.
I don’t know who is more to blame.
I believe the representatives of the Economic Council.
We cannot satisfy everybody.
While we are supply-ing Petrograd, Moscow is hungering for currency notes.
.
.
** If people only wrote assignments and did not take any measures, they should have come here, or called me to the phone or somebody else, and complained about it.
It is a rare week when I do not receive a complaint about money not being paid out, but from you I never received a single com-plaint.
The people in charge should be made to answer for it, at least reprimanded.
Under the ruling of February 21 the congress of river transport workers is obliged to submit the estimates.

Board.
I think we should have corrected our decree rather in the vein Comrade Shlyapnikov suggested.
Paragraph 3 provides for a Board of seven members.
Why this wasn’t inserted is incomprehensible.
A number of trade union representatives could be included in it.
I propose that resolute measures be taken to have this money forwarded immediately by through goods trains.
Then notification should be sent in the usual way saying the money has been dispatched.
As regards the second point I believe the only Board possible in this instance and most acceptable for everyone, for the Council of People’s Commissars—the only possible Board is the one appointed yesterday by the Council of People’s Commissars.
There are no grounds for changing this.
I believe we should put this through.
And if it’s really true about the 200 rubles salary, which was adopted as definite and made a condition for the nationalisation of transport—if that’s a fact, and if demands are made for levelling up with other organisations, then I personally raise the question of cancelling nationalisation.
There may come a time shortly when there will be no money at all.
We had a single guarantee on the basis of which we wanted to carry out nationalisation, and this is being taken away from us.
If that’s the case, this measure should be revoked.
Unless this is done we shall be taking on another respon-sibility incurring enormous losses.
3 I find the appointment of a commissar inconvenient in many respects.
We have no indisputable candidate for this post.
Therefore we shall not satisfy all requirements, inas-much as both sides will be dissatisfied.
The appointment of a commissar will mean setting aside the Union, and that form is undemocratic.
We shall pass a decision for them to submit a proposal by the morning.
If the Board is too unwieldy it could elect an executive committee.
We can implement that organisationally tomorrow or the day after and have the thing put through organisationally at once within a fixed period.
In appointing an executive committee, certain people could perhaps be appointed to it.
This wouldbe correct, as we would not be setting aside the river trans-port workers.
They can have no objection to co-operation by the trade unions.
If this doesn’t go through, we can then go ahead with the appointment of a commissar.
The members of this Council know that the question of a candidate is, of course, a difficult one, and to decide now on appointing a commissar is to decide nothing, as we quite often waste a whole week over it.
It is best to use this method.
There remains one proposal—to revoke points 5, 6 and 7.
Adopted.
Under Paragraph 3 six Board members will be replaced by temporary representatives from the trade unions.

59 Which Russians< In Russia today there is one power, which by its nature is destined to wage a life and death struggle against the attacks of international imperialism—that is the Power of the Soviets.
The first step, however, of those Russians, whom the Japanese intend to “help”, as soon as they heard rumours of the advance of the latter, was to demand the abolition of the Soviet Power.
Should the Japanese move into Siberia, these same “Russians” whom the Japanese are going to “help”, will demand the abolition of the Soviets throughout the whole of Siberia.
What can take the place of the Soviet Power? The only power that can take its place is a bourgeois government.
But the bourgeoisie in Russia has proved clearly enough that it can only remain in power with foreign help.
If a bourgeois government, supported by outside help, should establish itself in power in Siberia, and Eastern Russia become lost to the Soviet, then in Western Russia the Soviet Power would become weakened to such an extent that it could hardly hold out for long; it would be followed by a bourgeois government, which would also need foreign help.
The Power to give this help would, of course, not be England.
It is easy to understand what avenues are opened up by this possibility.

.
.
** Today this task—which is, of course, not yet sufficiently completed and can never be fully accomplished—no longer stands first among the tasks facing the Soviet government.
The recent congresses of the Soviets, notably the All-Russia Congress held in Moscow, have shown that the overwhelming majority of the labouring classes have firmly and consciously sided with the Soviet power in general and with the Bolshevik Party in particular.
It goes without saying that for any government that is at all democratic the task of convincing the masses can never be wholly overshadowed—on the contrary, it will always be among the important tasks of government.
As a key issue, however, it will only have significance for parties of the opposition or for parties that * Here the manuscript breaks off.

are fighting for ideals of the future.
After the Bolsheviks, first under tsarism and then under Kerensky, had succeeded in winning over to their side the majority of the class-con-scious active elements of the working masses, our Party was faced with the task of conquering power and suppressing the resistance of the exploiters.
The task that came to the fore was that of winning, instead of convincing, Russia.
From the end of October 1917 approximately up to February 1918 the militant or military task held first place, as it naturally should for any political party making a bid for power in conditions of sharp and extremely bitter struggle.
Obviously, for the Party of the proletariat, the task of suppressing the resistance of the exploiters becomes a crucial issue, because the working masses who side with the proletariat are opposed here by the united members of the propertied classes armed both with the power of capital, the power of knowledge and the long-standing, if not age-old, habit and practice of government.
Owing to the special conditions that were created in Russia under the influence of the unforgotten lessons of the revolution of 1905 and the influence of the far more painful and harsher lessons of the present war—owing to these conditions the Bolsheviks succeeded with compara-tive ease in solving the problem of winning power both in the capital and in the chief industrial centres of Russia.
But in the provinces, in places far removed from the centre, and especially in districts known to have the greatest concentra-tion of a comparatively backward population rooted in the traditions of the monarchy and medievalism—the Cossack regions, for instance—Soviet power had to contend with a resistance that took on military forms and is only now, more than four months after the October Revolution, coming to an end.
At the present time the task of overcoming and suppressing the resistance of the exploiters in Russia is, in the main, completed.
Russia has been won by the Bolsheviks chiefly because—as that prominent leader of the counter-revolutionary Don Cossacks, Bogayevsky himself, recently admitted—the overwhelming majority of the people even among the Cossacks have consciously, firmly and definitely sided with the Bolsheviks.
But the special conditions in which the propertied classes are placed economically enable them naturally to organise not onlypassive resistance (sabotage), but to repeat the attempt at military resistance to Soviet power.
For that reason the task of suppressing the resistance of the exploiters cannot be regarded as having been finally completed.
At any rate, it has now obviously been dealt with in its main aspects and is retreating into the background.
The Soviet government will never for a moment allow itself to forget about this task and will under no circumstances let itself be diverted from it by any political or so-called socialist names or decla-mations.
We have to speak about this because both the Men-sheviks and the Right S.
R.
s act as the most mobile, some-times even as the most brazen-faced counter-revolutionaries, who wage a sharper struggle against the Soviet government than the one they had allowed themselves to wage against the reactionary and landowner governments, and rely on their party’s label and designation to protect them.
Natural-ly, the Soviet government will never falter in its task of suppressing the resistance of the exploiters, no matter what party banners or what popular and specious names this resistance may be covered up with.
However, at the present time the task of suppressing resistance has, in the main, been completed, and the task now confronting us is that of administering the state.
This transition from what was once the priority task of convincing the masses, a transition from the task of winning power and crushing the resistance of the exploiters by military force to what is now the primary task of administer-ing the state—this transition is the main feature of the present moment.
The difficulty which the Soviet government is experiencing is that of bringing home the essentials of this transition to all the class-conscious elements of the working masses as well as the people’s political leaders.
For it is self-understood that the transition to the peaceful tasks of governing the whole population irrespective of classes, a transition that is taking place in conditions when the civil war is still going on in some places, when grave military dangers are threatening the Soviet Republic from both the West and the East, and when the war has caused untold havoc throughout the country—it is self-understood that such a transition is beset with tremendous difficul-ties.
CHAPTER V The task of administering the state, which now confronts the Soviet government, has this special feature, that, probably for the first time in the modern history of civilised nations, it deals pre-eminently with economics rather than with politics.
Usually the word “administration” is associated chiefly, if not solely, with political activity.
However, the very basis and essence of Soviet power, like that of the transition itself from capitalist to socialist society, lie in the fact that political tasks occupy a subordinate position to economic tasks.
And now, especially after the practical experience of over four months of Soviet government in Russia, it should be quite clear to us that the task of administering the state is primarily a purely economic task—that of healing the country’s wounds inflicted by the war, restoring its productive forces, organising accountancy in and control over production and distribution, raising the productivity of labour—in short, it boils down to the task of economic reorganisation.
This task can be said to fall under two main headings: 1) accounting and control over production and distribution in the broadest, most widespread and universal forms of such accounting and control, and 2) raising the productivity of labour.
These tasks can be handled by any form of collective effort or any form of state passing over to socialism only on condition that the basic economic, social, cultural and political preconditions for this have been created in a suf-ficient degree by capitalism.
Without large-scale machine production, without a more or less developed network of railways, postal and telegraph communications, without a more or less developed network of public educational institutions, neither of these tasks can be carried out in a systematic way on a national scale.
Russia is in a position when quite a number of these initial preconditions for such a transition actually exist.
On the other hand, quite a number of these preconditions are absent in our country, but can be borrowed by it fairly easily from the experience of the neighbouring, far more advanced countries, whom history and international intercourse have long since placed in close contact with Russia.
C H A P T E R VI The basic aim of every society going over to a socialist system consists in the victory of the ruling class—or rather the class that is growing up to be the ruling class—namely, the proletariat, over the bourgeoisie as described above.
And this task is set before us in a substantially new way, quite unlike the way it stood in the course of many decades of the proletariat’s world-wide experience of struggle against the bourgeoisie.
Now, after the gains of the October Revolu-tion, after our successes in the civil war, victory over the bourgeoisie should stand for something much bigger, albeit more peaceful in form: namely, victory over the bourgeoisie, now that it has been secured politically and made good militarily, should now be achieved in the sphere of organisa-tion of the national economy, in the sphere of organisation of production, in the sphere of country-wide accounting and control.
The problem of accounting and control over produc-tion was dealt with by the bourgeoisie all the more effectively in proportion as production expanded and the network of national economic institutions embracing tens and hundreds of millions of the population of a large modern state became more ramified.
We must handle this task now in a new way, backed by the predominating position of the proletariat, supported by the bulk of the working and exploited masses, making use of those elements of organising talent and techni-cal knowledge which have been accumulated by the preceding society, and nine-tenths, perhaps even ninety-nine hundredths of which belong to a class hostile and opposed to the socialist revolution.
C H A P T E R VII German imperialism, which has made the greatest advance not only in military power and military techniques, but in big industrial organisations within the framework of capitalism, has incidentally given proof of its economic progressiveness by bring the first country to introduce labour conscription.
Naturally, in the conditions of capitalistsociety in general and particularly when the monarchist states are waging an imperialist war, labour conscription is nothing more than a military convict prison for the workers, a new means of enslaving the working and exploited masses, a new system of measures for suppressing all protest on’ the part of these masses.
Nevertheless, there is no question that it is only because of the economic preconditions created by big capitalism that such a reform could be put forward and effected.
And now we, amid conditions of appalling post-war economic disorganisation, are obliged to consider the urgency of a similar reform.
Naturally, Soviet power, which is passing from a capitalist to a socialist organisation of society, must tackle this problem of labour conscription from the other end, opposite to that of German imperialism.
For the capitalists and imperialists of Germany labour conscription meant enslavement of the workers.
For the workers and peasant poor in Russia labour conscription should mean, first and foremost, recruitment of the rich and propertied classes for the discharge of their social duties.
We should start labour conscription with the rich.
This is necessitated, generally speaking, not only by the fact that the Soviet Republic is a socialist republic.
The necessity arises also from the fact that it was precisely the wealthy and propertied classes who, by their resistance, both military and passive (sabotage), mostly prevented Russia from healing the wounds inflicted upon her by the war, hampered the country’s economic rehabilitation and progress.
That is why accounting and control, which should be now considered a problem of paramount importance in the whole business of state administration, must be applied first of all to the wealthy and propertied classes.
It was the members of these classes who enjoyed the tribute they collected from the working people, especially during the war; it was they who used this tribute to evade a task which is the duty of every citizen, namely, that of lending a hand in healing the country’s wounds and putting it on its feet again; it was they who used the plundered tribute to retire and entrench themselves behind impregnable walls and offer every possible resistance to the victory of the socialist principle over the capitalist principle of society’s organisation.
One of the chief weapons of such struggle against the Soviets and against socialismon the part of the wealthy and propertied classes was their possession of considerable hoards of currency notes.
The propertied classes in capitalist society derived most of their wealth from the land and other means of production, such as factories, mills, etc.
, which they owned.
The Soviet government had no difficulty, thanks to the support of the workers and the great majority of the peasants, in abolishing the right of the landowners and the bourgeoisie to these basic items of the country’s wealth.
It was not difficult to decree the abolition of private property in land.
It was not difficult to nationalise most of the factories and mills.
There is no doubt that the nationalisation of other big industrial enterprises and transport facilities is a problem that will easily be dealt with in the very near future.
Capitalist society, however, has created another form of wealth, which is by no means so easy for the Soviet govern-ment to deal with.
This is wealth in the form of money, or rather, currency notes.
Currency notes during the war were issued in very great numbers.
Russia was cut off by a wall of military operations from commerce with a number of countries who had been her largest importers and exporters.
The amassment of currency notes in the hands of the wealthy and propertied classes, practically all of whom, directly or indirectly, had speculated on the high prices for military contracts and supplies, is one of the chief means by which the propertied classes amassed wealth and accumulated power over the working people.
Today the economic position of Russia, as probably of every capitalist country that has gone through three years of war, is characterised by the fact that enormous amounts of paper money are concentrated in the hands of and hoarded by a comparatively small minority, the bourgeoisie and propertied classes, and this paper money, though greatly depreciated through massive emission, still represents a claim to levy tribute on the working population.
During the transition from capitalist to socialist society it is absolutely impossible to do without currency notes or to replace them with new ones in a short space of time.
The Soviet government is now confronted with a difficult task, which nevertheless has to be dealt with at all costs—the task of combating the resistance of the wealthy, a resistancethat takes the form of hoarding and concealing the proofs of their claim to levy tribute on the working people.
These proofs are currency notes.
Naturally, while these currency notes previously gave the right to acquire and purchase the means of production, such as land, factories, mills, etc.
, their significance today has diminished and even been reduced to naught.
The purchase of land has become impossible in Russia after promulgation of the law on the socialisation of the land, while the purchase of factories and mills and similar large-scale means of production and transport has become practically impossible owing to the rapid process of nationalisation and confiscation of all such large enterprises.
And so, it becomes more and more difficult and almost impossible for members of the bourgeoisie and propertied classes (including the peasant bourgeoisie) to acquire money for the purchase of the means of production.
But in defending their old privileges and trying to retard and obstruct as much as they can the business of socialist reforms within the country, the bourgeoisie are hoarding and concealing the proofs of their claim to a share in the social wealth, their claim to levy tribute on the working people, hoarding and concealing currency notes in order to have a chance, however slender, of maintaining their position and recovering their old privileges in the event of difficulties or crises of a military or commercial nature that might yet beset Russia.
As regards consumer goods, the possibility of buying them with the sums of paper money they have accumulated through speculations during the war remains almost fully with the bourgeoisie and propertied classes, since the problem of proper rationing and distribution of these goods in a country like Russia, with her huge population of small peasants, petty artisans or handicraftsmen, presents tremendous difficulties, and in the prevailing state of economic chaos caused by the war this problem still remains practically unsolved.
Thus, the Soviet government is obliged to start the business of accounting and control over production and distribution by an organised struggle against the wealthy and propertied classes who are hoarding vast sums in currency notes and evading state control.
It is estimated that currency notes to the value of about thirty thousand million rubles have been issued in Russiato date.
Of this sum probably no less than twenty thousand million, or maybe considerably more, are excess hoards unneeded for trade turnover, which are kept hidden away by members of the bourgeoisie and propertied classes for motives of self-interest—or class self-interest.
The Soviet government will have to combine the introduc-tion of labour conscription with the registration, in the first place, of people belonging to the bourgeoisie and propertied classes; it will have to demand truthful statements (declara-tions) concerning the amount of currency notes available; it will have to take a number of measures to make sure that this demand will not remain on paper; it will have to consider transitional measures for concentrating all stocks of currency notes in the State Bank or its branches.
Unless these measures are taken, the business of accounting and control over production and distribution cannot be effectively carried through.
C H A P T E R VIII The introduction of labour conscription, however, cannot be confined to accounting and control over the sums of currency notes concentrated in the hands of the propertied classes.
The Soviet government will have to apply the principles of labour conscription also to the direct activities of the bourgeoisie and propertied classes in the sphere of factory management and the servicing of enterprises by all kinds of subsidiary labour such as book-keeping, accountancy, clerical work, technical, administrative and other jobs.
In this respect, too, the task of the Soviet government is now shifting from the sphere of direct struggle against sabotage to the sphere of business organisation in the new conditions, since after the victories won by the Soviets in the civil war, beginning with October and ending February, a breach has virtually been made in the passive forms of resistance, namely, in the sabotage by the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois intellectuals.
It is no accident that at the present time we are witnessing a sweeping, one might say widespread, change of sentiment and political behaviour in the camp of the former saboteurs, i.
e.
, the capitalists and bourgeois intellectuals.
In all spheres of economic and political lifewe now find a great number of bourgeois intellectuals and capitalist businessmen offering their services to the Soviet power.
And it is up to the Soviet power now to make use of these services, which are definitely necessary for the transi-tion to socialism, especially in a peasant country like Russia, and should be utilised on condition that the Soviet government has complete ascendancy, direction and control over its new assistants and co-operators (who had often acted in defiance of this same Soviet power in the secret hope of protesting it).
To show how necessary it is for the Soviet government to make use of the services of bourgeois intellectuals for the transition to socialism, we venture to use an expression that may at first glance seem paradoxical: we must to a considerable extent, take a lesson in socialism from the trust managers, we must take a lesson in socialism from capitalism’s big organisers.
That this is no paradox anyone can easily see who realises that it is the big factories, big machine industry, which developed exploitation of the working people to an unheard-of degree, that it is precisely the big factories that are the centres of concentration of that class which alone has been able to destroy the rule of capital and begin the transition to socialism.
It is not surprising, therefore, that in order to solve the practical problems of socialism, when the organisational aspects of it are pushed to the fore, we must enlist to the service of the Soviet power a great number of bourgeois intellectuals, especially from among those who were engaged in the practical work of organising large-scale capitalist production, that is to say, first and foremost, those engaged in organising syndicates, cartels and trusts.
Tackling this problem will require of the Soviet government an exertion of energy and initiative by the working masses in all fields of the national economy, since the old position held by the so-called captains of industry—the old position of the masters and exploiters— this old position the Soviet government will never let them have.
The former captains of industry, the former masters and exploiters, must be employed as technical experts, managers, consultants, advisers.
A new, difficult, but extremely gratifying problem must be solved, that of combining all the experience and knowledge which thesemembers of the exploiting classes have accumulated, with the initiative, energy and work of the broad masses of the working people.
For only by this combination is it possible to build the bridge leading from the old capitalist to the new socialist society.
If the socialist revolution had won simultaneously throughout the world or, at least, in a number of advanced countries, then the task of enlisting the services of the best technician specialists from among the leaders of old capita-lism to the process of the new organisation of production would have been made considerably easier.
Backward Russia would not have to wrestle with this problem on her own, as the advanced workers of the West-European countries would have come to her help and relieved her of most of the complexities involved in that most difficult of all tasks arising in the period of transition to socialism known as the organisational task.
In the present situation, when the socialist revolution in the West is slow and late in coming, and Russia has to speed up measures for her reorganisation, if only in order to save the population from starvation and afterwards the whole country from a possible foreign military invasion—in the present situation we have to borrow from the advanced countries, not their help in socialist organisation and the support of the workers, but the help of their bourgeoisie and capitalist intellectuals.
Things have so shaped themselves that we are able to get this help by organising the assistance of the bourgeois intellectuals in solving the new organisational problems of the Soviet power.
This assistance can be secured by paying high salaries to the best specialists in every field of know-ledge, both to the citizens of this country and to those invited from abroad.
Naturally, in a developed socialist society it would appear quite unfair and incorrect for members of the bourgeois intelligentsia to receive considerably higher pay than that received by the best sections of the working class.
Under the conditions of practical reality, however.
.
.
* we must solve this pressing problem by means of this (unfair) remuneration for bourgeois specialists at much higher rates.

If, for example, we found that in order to organise production in Russia on new lines, in order to raise the productivity of labour and train our people in the art of working in better conditions—if we had to employ for this purpose, say two thousand big specialists in different fields of knowledge, specialists from among Russian and still more from among foreign, let us say, American sources—if we had to pay them fifty or a hundred million rubles a year, such an expense, from the point of view of the interests of the national econo-my, and generally from the point of view of abandoning out-worn methods of production for newer and more up-to-date methods, would be fully warranted.
Such a sum is worth paying to have our people trained in better methods and techniques of production, and we shall have to pay it because, short of the victory of the socialist revolution in other countries, there is no other possibility of getting this leadership.
Of course, employment of the labour and guidance of the bourgeois intellectuals in combination with proper control by the democratic organisations of the working people and the Soviets, will create a number of new problems, but these problems will be quite solvable.
No difficulties can stop us from solving these problems, as we have no other way out towards a higher organisation of production under the present situation.
I shall go further.
Big capitalism has created systems of work organisation, which, under the prevailing conditions of exploitation of the masses, represent the harshest form of enslavement by which the minority, the propertied classes, wring out of the working people surplus amounts of labour, strength, blood and nerves.
At the same time they are the last word in the scientific organisation of production, and as such, have to be adopted by the Socialist Soviet Republic and readjusted to serve the interests of our accounting and control over production on the one hand, and raising the productivity of labour, on the other.
For instance, the famous Taylor system, which is so widespread in America, is famous precisely because it is the last word in reckless capitalist exploitation.
One can understand why this system met with such an intense hatred and protest on the part of the workers.
At the same time, we must not for a momentforget that the Taylor system represents the tremendous progress of science, which systematically analyses the process of production and points the way towards an immense increase in the efficiency of human labour.
The scientific researches which the introduction of the Taylor system started in America, notably that of motion study, as the Americans call it, yielded important data allowing the working popula-tion to be trained in incomparably higher methods of labour in general and of work organisation in particular.
The negative aspect of Taylorism was that it was applied in conditions of capitalist slavery and served as a means of squeezing double and triple the amount of labour out of the workers at the old rates of pay regardless of whether the hired workers were capable of giving this double and triple amount of labour in the same number of working hours without detriment to the human organism.
The Socialist Soviet Republic is faced with a task which can be briefly formulated thus: we must introduce the Taylor system and scientific American efficiency of labour throughout Russia by combining this system with a reduction in working time, with the application of new methods of production and work organisation undetrimental to the labour power of the working population.
On the contrary, the Taylor system, properly controlled and intelligently applied by the working people themselves, will serve as a reliable means of further greatly reducing the obligatory working day for the entire working population, will serve as an effective means of dealing, in a fairly short space of time, with a task that could roughly be expressed as follows: six hours of physical work daily for every adult citizen and four hours of work in running the state.
The adoption of such a system would call for very many new skills and new organisational bodies.
Without doubt, this will create for us many difficulties, and the posing of such a task will even evoke perplexity if not resistance among certain sections of the working people themselves.
We may be sure, however, that the progressive elements among the working class will understand the need for such a transition, and that the appalling extent of the economic chaos witnessed in the towns and villages by millions of men returning from the front who had been torn away from it alland now saw the full extent of the ravages caused by the war—all this, without doubt, has prepared the ground for shaping public opinion in this direction, and we may be sure that the transition which we have roughly outlined above will be accepted as a practical task by all elements among the working classes who have now consciously sided with the Soviet government.
C H A P T E R IX An economic transition of the above nature calls also for a corresponding change in the functions of Soviet leadership.
It is quite natural, in a situation under which the main task was to convince the majority of the nation or to win power and crush the resistance of the exploiters, that among the leaders, too, those who came to the fore should have been agitators in regard to the masses, with whom Soviet power was more closely connected than any other democratic form of government in the past.
Naturally, winning over the majority of the population or drawing it into a hard and difficult armed struggle against the exploiters called above all for agitators of ability.
Conversely, the tasks outlined above and aimed at establishing accounting and control over production and distribution, advance to the fore practical managers and organisers.
Accordingly, a certain reappraisal of leaders, certain shifts among them, should be effected in cases where they are unable to adapt themselves to the new conditions and the new task.
Naturally, the leadership of a past period accustomed chiefly to agitators’ tasks, would find such a transition very difficult.
Naturally, a number of mistakes because of this was unavoidable.
Both the leaders and the Soviet electorate at large, that is, the working and exploited masses, must now be made to see the necessity for this change.
Among the working and exploited masses there is far more talent and ability as organisers than as agitators, for the entire work milieu of these classes demanded of them to a much greater extent the ability to organise joint work and a system of accounting and control over production and distribution.
Their former conditions of life, on the contrary,provided far less grounds for advancing from their midst leaders possessing the gift of agitators or propagandists.
Perhaps that is why we so often see now agitators and propagandists by vocation or calling who are compelled to assume the tasks of organisers, and who have it brought home to them at every step that they are not quite fit for the job and that the workers and peasants are disappointed and dissatisfied with them.
These mistakes and failures of the Soviet government often provoke malicious glee among classes that are hostile to the idea of a socialist remodelling of society, among members of the bourgeois parties or those who call themselves socialist parties but who actually serve the bourgeoisie with zeal—people like the Mensheviks and the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries.
Clear as the historical inevitability of these mistakes is, it is equally clear that the shortcomings in this respect are merely the growing pains of the new socialist society.
There can be no doubt that the representatives of Soviet power all over Russia can and will requalify without great difficulty, that the practical agitators will learn to occupy a befitting leading place.
This, however, will take time, and only practical experience by trial and error is capable of bringing a clear realisation of the need for change, capable of bringing to the fore a number of people, or even a whole cross-section, fit to deal with the new tasks.
There is probably more organising talent among the workers and peasants than the bourgeoisie imagine.
The trouble is that these talents have no chance to develop, make good and win a place for themselves in the conditions of capitalist economy.
On the other hand, if we clearly recognise today the need for enlisting new organising talent on a broad scale to the business of running the state, if we—guided by the principles of Soviet power—start systematically promoting to leading positions people who have practical experience in this busi-ness, we shall succeed in a short time in building up a new stratum of practical organisers of production, who, on the basis of the principles evolved by Soviet power, principles cast among the masses and carried into practice by the masses under the control of Soviet bodies representing the mass membership, will win a position for themselves befitting their role of leadership.
CHAPTER X Soviet government will have to pass over, or rather it will simultaneously have to deal with, the problem of applying corresponding principles to the bulk of the workers and peasants.
Here the task of introducing labour conscription presents its other side to us.
We must approach this problem differently and highlight different things to those that have to be applied in the case of the wealthy classes.
We see no essential need for registering all the working people, for keeping an eye on their stocks of currency notes or their consumption, since all the conditions of life compel the vast majority of these sections of the population to work for their living and give them no chance to hoard anything but the most meagre stocks.
Therefore, the task of introducing labour conscription in this field resolves itself into the task of establishing labour discipline and self-discipline.
In the old capitalist society discipline over the working people was enforced by capital through the constant threat of starvation.
This threat being combined with excessively heavy toil and the workers’ awareness that they were working, not for themselves, but for somebody else’s benefit, the conditions of labour became a constant struggle of the great majority of the working people against the organisers of production.
This inevitably created a psychology in which public opinion among the working people not only did not frown on poor work or shirkers, but, on the contrary, saw in this an inevitable and legitimate protest against or means of resistance to the excessive demands of the exploiters.
If the bourgeois press and its echoers are now shouting so much about anarchy among the workers, about their lack of discipline and excessive demands, the vicious nature of this criticism is so obvious that it is not worth dwelling on.
It is only natural that in a country like Russia, where the bulk of the population for the last three years has endured such appalling hunger and privations, there should have been a number of cases of utter despondency and a break-down of organisation.
To demand a quick change in this connection or to expect such changes to be achieved by several decrees, would be as absurd as resorting to appeals in an attempt to restore good cheer and energy into a man who had beenbeaten within an inch of his life.
Only the Soviet government, created by the working people themselves, and taking into consideration the growing signs of recovery among them, is in a position to carry out radical changes in this respect.
The need for working out systematic measures to improve self-discipline among the working people has now been fully brought home to the representatives of Soviet power and its supporters—the political-minded trade union leaders, for instance.
There is no doubt that in the environment of capitalist society in general, and still more, in the atmosphere of frenzied, unbridled speculation created by the war, there has seeped in among the working class an element of demoralisation that will seriously need coping with.
All the more that, owing to the war, the composition of the working-class vanguard itself has not changed for the better either.
Therefore, the maintenance of discipline among the working people, the organisation of control over the measure of labour and the intensity of labour, the introduc-tion of special industrial courts for establishing the measure of labour, for prosecuting those guilty of flagrant violations of this measure, and for exercising systematic influence on the majority with the object of raising this measure—all this has now been brought to the fore as one of the most urgent tasks of the Soviet government.
The only thing is to bear in mind that in bourgeois society one of the principal instruments of social education, namely, the press, completely failed to discharge its task in this respect.
And to this day our Soviet press, too, is still largely under the influence of the old habits and old traditions of bourgeois society.
This is evidenced, among other things, by the fact that our press, like the old bourgeois press, con-tinues to devote too much space and attention to political trivia, to those personal questions of political leadership by which the capitalists of all countries have striven to draw the attention of the masses away from the really important, profound and cardinal questions of their life.

APRIL 1, 1918 The question under discussion is a draft resolution concerning labour discipline drawn up by the All-Russia Council of Trade Unions.
Comrade Lenin moves a number of amendments and more definite wordings of different points in the draft, which he suggests should be concretised.
Piece wages should be fixed for all industries without exception, and in the case of trades where that is not possible, a system of bonuses should be introduced.
To keep account of productivity and maintain discipline it is necessary to set up industrial courts, to form groups of controllers of various trades, not at the enterprise, but from outside,and enlisting the co-operation of engineers, book-keepers and peasants.
The decree should definitely provide for the introduction of the Taylor system, in other words, every use should be made of the scientific methods of work suggested by this system.
Without it, productivity cannot be raised, without it we shall not be able to introduce socialism.
In the application of this system American engineers are to be enlisted.
Naturally, in introducing it, due consideration should be given to the poor nutrition.
The rates of output, therefore, should make allowance for a low diet.
Further-more, it is necessary to organise output.
.
.
* in the transition to socialism may enable us to reduce the working day.
The decree should mention accountancy and the printing of reports concerning the productivity of the various enter-prises.
As to penal measures for breaches of labour discipline, these are to be stricter.
Punishment should go to the length of imprisonment.
Dismissal, too, may be applied, but this will be of an entirely different nature.
Under the capitalist system dismissal was a breach of a civic agreement.
Now, a breach of discipline, especially with the introduction of compulsory labour service, will be a criminal offence subject to a definite punishment.

To hoard surpluses of grain and other food products at a time when the people in Petrograd, in Moscow, and in dozens of non-agricultural uyezds are not only suffering from a shortage of bread, but are cruelly starving, is an enormous crime deserving the most ruthless punishment.

The task of fighting famine does not only consist in pumping grain out of the grain-producing areas, but in having all grain surpluses, as well as all foodstuffs in general, delivered to and collected by the state.
Unless this is done, there can be no question of any socialist reforms or of our being able to wage an effective defensive war.

Written June 1 5 , 1 9 1 8 First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXI Printed from the manuscript THE DEMOCRATISM AND SOCIALIST NATURE OF SOVIET POWER The democratism of Soviet power and its socialist nature are expressed in the fact that the supreme state authority is vested in the Soviets, which are made up of representatives of the working people (workers, soldiers and peasants), freely elected and removable at any time by the masses hitherto oppressed by capital; that the local Soviets freely amalgamate on a basis of democratic centralism into a single federal union as represented by the Soviet state power of the Russian Soviet Republic; that the Soviets concentrate in their hands not only the legislative power and supervision of law enforcement, but direct enforcement of the laws through all the members of the Soviets with a view to a gradual transition to the performance of legislative functions and state administration by the whole working population.
Taking, further, into consideration, that any direct or indirect legalisation of the rights of ownership of the workers of any given factory or any given trade on their particular production, or of their right to weaken or impede the orders of the state authority, isa flagrant distortion of the basic principles of Soviet power and a complete rejection of socialism.

1 1 2 Printed from the manuscript INTERVIEW GIVEN TO THE CORRESPONDENT OF F O L K E T S D A G B L A D P O L I T I K E N JULY 1, 1918 87 Your correspondent talked today with Lenin concerning the situation in Russia and the general situation in Europe.
Lenin emphasised that a revolution is always born in travail.
A country making a revolution on its own will always find itself in a serious position.
But the situation is difficult everywhere, not only in Russia.
There is said to be anarchy in Russia, but that is the fruit of four years of war, and not of the Bolshevik regime.
The few remaining weeks until the new harvest will be the most difficult.
The harvest promises to be a good one.
The counter-revolution is trying its hardest to take advantage of the present situation.
The counter-revolution consists of rich peasants and officers, but without foreign support they are powerless.
In the towns where the counter-revolutionaries had won, they remained in power only a few days, if not a few hours.
The assassination of Volodarsky, organised by the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, really reveals the weakness of the counter-revolutionaries.
The history of the Russian revolution shows that a party always resorts to individual terror when it does not enjoy the support of the masses.
* * * Opposition within the Bolshevik Party against the peace of Brest has subsided, says Lenin.
Bukharin, Radek and the rest are taking part in the work again.
Peace is necessary * Here the manuscript breaks off.
—Ed.
in order to prevent the Germans from seizing the whole of Russia and strangling the revolution.
As regards the measures taken against the anarchists, these are due to the fact that the anarchists had been arming and some of them had been joining up with patently bandit elements.
The anarchists who are dedicated to an ideal have already been released and their big daily Anarkhia is coming out as usual.
88 Amid all these difficulties, industry is being organised.
The owners of the enterprises are still sabotaging on a broad scale, but the workers are taking the management of the enterprises into their own hands.
Referring to the Czechoslovak revolt, Lenin expressed confidence that it would be suppressed by the Soviet troops, although it was dragging out.
* * * The Germans in the Ukraine are in a very difficult plight.
They are receiving no grain whatever from the peasants.
The peasants are arming and attacking the German soldiers in large groups wherever they are met with.
This movement is spreading.
Owing to the German occupation Bolshevism in the Ukraine has become a sort of national movement.
It is rallying around it people who would not hear of Bolshevism before that.
If the Germans occupied Russia, the result would be the same.
The Germans need peace.
It is significant that in the Ukraine the Germans want peace more than the Ukrainians themselves do.
The same applies to Turkey.
The Germans have concluded an advantageous agreement with the Ukrainian Rada despite the fact that people in the Ukraine have always criticised the peace of Brest.
Now the Germans are helping to fight the Bolsheviks in the Caucasus.
* * * We in Russia now have to wait for the revolutionary movement to develop in Europe.
The war party in Germany today is so strong that it speaks with contempt of the government in Berlin.
Resistance to imperialism, however, is growing even in bourgeois circles.
Sooner or later thingseverywhere will lead to political and social collapse.
The present situation is unstable, but a better order of things cannot be created merely with the aid of war and bloodshed.

The “Internationale” was sung.
) In his speech Lenin, in a clear and popular form, explained the essential features and basic points of the Soviet Constitution.
The Soviets were the highest form of democratic government by the people.
The Soviets were not something invented out of one’s head, they were the product of living reality.

appeared and developed for the first time in history in our backward country, but objectively they should become the form of government by the working people all over the world.
All constitutions that had existed till now safeguarded the interests of the ruling classes.
The Soviet Constitution was the only one that served and would constantly serve the working people and was a powerful weapon in the fight for socialism.
Comrade Lenin very aptly pointed out the differences between the demands for “freedom of the press and assembly” in bourgeois constitutions and in the Soviet Constitution.
There, freedom of the press and assembly was an exclusive monopoly of the bourgeoisie; there the bourgeoisie met in their saloons, issued their big dailies financed by the banks with the aim of sowing lies and slander and poisoning the minds of the masses; there the workers’ press was strangled, not allowed to say what it thought about the predatory war; there, those opposed to the war were hounded and their meetings banned.
Here in Soviet Russia, however, the workers’ press existed and served the working people.
In Russia we were taking the sumptuous houses and palaces away from the bourgeoisie and turning them over to the workers to be used by them as clubs, and that was freedom of assembly in practice.
Religion was a private concern.
Everyone could believe in what he wants or believe in nothing.
The Soviet Republic united the working people of all nations and defended the interests of the working people without national discrimination.
The Soviet Republic knew no religious distinctions.
It stood above all religion and strove to separate religion from the Soviet state.
Lenin went on to describe the Soviet Republic’s difficult position, surrounded as it was on all sides by imperialist predators.
Comrade Lenin expressed his confi-dence that the Red Army men would defend our Soviet Republic with all their might against all encroachments by international imperialism and would keep it safe until our ally—the international proletariat—came to our aid.

||| (in Berlin (openly) or in Holland ( secretly ), say, for 1.
II.
1 9 1 9) generally very soon For this we must (a) formulate platform principles (I think we could (α) take the theory and practice of Bolshevism—have Bukharin set this forth in theses, as briefly as possible.
Talk it over with Bukharin—perhaps take part of them from my draft programme * (β) then take “Was will der Spartacusbund<”).
α & β give sufficiently clear platform principles; (b) define the basis (organisational) of the Third Inter-national (nothing in common with the social-patriots); (c) give a list of parties, roughly under three headings αα) parties and groups we have good reason to consider as already sharing the platform of the Third Inter-national and as being sufficiently unanimous on the question of formally founding the Third International: ββ) parties close to this, from whom we expect alignment and affiliation; γγ) groups and currents within the social-patriotic parties more or less close to Bolshevism.
I am offering’ a tentative list (p.
4) ** ; additions should be made with care.
Who are we inviting to our conference? Only α α &β β &γ γ and only those (1) who resolutely stand for a break with the social-patriots (i.
e.
, the people who, directly or indirectly, supported the bourgeois governments during the imperialist war of 1914-18); 2) who are for a socialist revolution now and f o r the dictatorship of the proletariat; 3) who are in principle for “Soviet power” and against limitation of our work by bourgeois parliamentarism, against subordination to it, and who recognise the fact that the Soviet type of government is higher and closer to socialism.
Perhaps we should add that we do not suggest that the whole of the Third International immediately start calling itself “communist”, but we do place on the order of the day (for discussion) the question of resolutely rejecting the names of “Social-Democratic” and “socialist” parties, and adopting that of “communist” parties.

Written February 1 9 , 1 9 1 9 First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXIV Printed from the manuscript ON THE APPEAL OF THE GERMAN INDEPENDENTS 129 We seldom have a chance now of receiving foreign newspapers in Russia: the blockade with which the “demo-cratic capitalists” of the Entente have surrounded us is apparently operating effectively.
They are afraid to acquaint the educated workers of America, Britain and France with ignorant and uncivilised Bolshevism, they are afraid lest people in this land of uncivilised Bolshevism get to know of its successes in the West.
But despite the zealous efforts of the gendarmery of the new Holy Alliance to suppress it, the truth will out! The other day I happened to see several numbers of the Berlin newspaper Die Freiheit, the organ of the so-called “independent” German Social-Democrats.
The front page of No.
74 (for 11.
II.
1919) carried a lengthy appeal “To the Revolutionary Proletariat of Germany” signed by the Central Committee of the party and its parliamentary group.
The ideas, or rather the lack of ideas, underlying this appeal are so characteristic of not only the German, but of the world’s labour movement, that they deserve to be dwelt upon.
But first I should like to make a digression connected with personal reminiscences.
Among the signatures of the parliamentary group of Independents I came across the names of Seger and Laukant, and they reminded me of what happened three years ago.
I had occasion to meet Laukant at a meeting of the Zimmerwaldists in Berne.
130 This seemingly influential Berlin worker produced a dual impression: on the one hand, serious revolutionary work among the masses, on the other, an astonishing lack oftheoretical * and appalling short-sightedness.
Laukant did not like my sharp attacks on Kautsky (the ideological “leader” of the Independents, or rather leader of their non-ideology), but he did not refuse to help me when, doubtful of my unreliable German, I showed him the text of a short speech in German I had written, ** in which I quoted the statement of the “American Bebel”, Eugene Debs, to the effect that he would rather be shot than agree to vote for imperialist war loans, and that he would agree to fight only in a war of the workers against the capitalists.
On the other hand, when, with furious indignation, I showed Laukant the passage from Kautsky’s article in which that gentleman denounced the workers’ street demonstrations as adventurism 131 (and that under Wilhelm II) Laukant shrugged his shoulders and answered with exasperating coolness: “Our workers don’t read this as attentively as all that! I’m not obliged to agree with every line of Kautsky’s, am I?” Written in the second half of February 1 9 1 9 First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXIV Printed from the manuscript DRAFT DECISION FOR THE COUNCIL OF DEFENCE ON REGULATING RELATIONS BETWEEN THE VECHEKA, THE RAILWAY CHEKA AND THE COMMISSARIAT FOR RAILWAYS AND A LETTER TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF DEFENCE Decision of the Council of Defence 28.

Board member Belyakov.
The Cheka to be charged with supervising timely unload-ing of freights by the organisations and bodies concerned, and in the event of unloading work not being fulfilled in the time set by the Cheka, the guilty parties are to be called to account.
Local sections of the Railway Cheka to be given the right to use the railway telegraph (for payment) and made to bear strict responsibility for using it without need.
Detailed instructions on the use of the telegraph and method of payment to be issued by the People’s Commissar for Railways and the Chairman of the Vecheka by agreement.
The former premises of the railway police to be turned over to the Railway Cheka, and a special order to this effect to be issued by the C.

Comrades Dzerzhinsky and Sklyansky to issue joint instructions concerning the eviction of military guards from these premises.
Food rations to be issued in the usual way to the Railway Cheka from the supplies of the railway food organisations.
So long as martial law introduced on the railways by the Council of Defence continues, the district transport departments of the Cheka are to be given the right to apply capital punishment to persons found guilty of bribery, theft of freights and railway material, and systematic abuse on the part of officials.

It was the lack of this social awareness among the mass of the women, he said, that had acted as a brake in previous revolutions.

declares that the Soviet Republic has entered its most difficult month.
The Allies are making their last desperate effort to crush us by force of arms.
The food situation in the spring is the most difficult.
The transport system is utterly disrupted.
Only the greatest effort can save us.
Victory is possible.
The revolution in Hungary has proved conclusively that the Soviet movement in Western Europe is growing and its victory is not far off.
We have many allies all over the world, more than we imagine.
We must hold on for another four or five difficult months in order to beat our enemies.
This meeting harshly condemns the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, * the Mensheviks and the Right S.
R.
s who, while paying lip-service to Soviet power or protesting in word against the armed intervention of the Allies, are in fact helping the whiteguards when they agitate for strikes or for cessation of the civil war (although we offered peace to all! 136) or for concessions to freedom of trade, and so on.
This meeting declares that all those Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who are prepared to help us in our difficult struggle shall be ensured full liberty as citizens of the Soviet Republic.
This meeting, however, declares relentless war upon those Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries who, like the literary and political groups Vsegda Vperyod! 137 and * The first sheet of the manuscript is missing.

—Ed.
Dyelo Naroda, 138 are actually impeding our struggle, actually assisting the whiteguards.
This meeting calls upon all workers, all workers’ organi-sations and all working peasants to exert every effort to repel the enemies of Soviet power, to defend that power and improve the food supply and transport systems.
1.
To enlist members of the middle section—i.
e.
, people who are less experienced than the advanced workers and peasants—to replace the overworked advanced section.
2.
To send more and more contingents of the advanced and rank-and-file workers out on food supply, transport and army work.
3.
To enlist the largest possible number of politically conscious workers and peasants for work at the People’s Commissariat for Railways and the State Control, in order to improve the functioning of these bodies and to eliminate bureaucracy and red tape.
4.
To transfer as many people as possible from the starving cities to agricultural work, to vegetable gardening, to the rural districts, to the Ukraine, to the Don region, and so forth, in order to increase grain production.
All efforts to be exerted to assist the middle peasants, to put a stop to the abuses from which they so often suffer, and to render them comradely help.
Those Soviet officials who refuse to carry out this policy—which is the only correct one—or who fail to understand it, must be imme-diately dismissed.
5.
To combat all signs of weariness, faint-heartedness and vacillation, to enhearten in every way those who show such signs, strengthen their spirit, consciousness and comradely discipline.
The working class and the peasantry of Russia have borne incredible burdens.
The last few months have been incredibly difficult.
But this meeting declares that the workers have not lost heart, that the working class remains at its post, that it will overcome all difficulties and maintain at all costs the victory of the Soviet Socialist Republic in Russia and throughout the world.

C.
resolves; 1) once more to draw the attention of the People’s Commissars for Post and Telegraph and for Railways to the necessity of exerting every effort to improve post and telegraph connections in the area of Mamontov’s operations and speed up the transportation of troops in that area.

2 Draft directives of the C.
C.
Politbureau to be drawn up at once.
It is considered politically essential 1) to speed up transportation of the Belebei Bashkir Division to Petrograd and effect this movement as energetic-ally as possible; 2) Tula and the defence of the north generally against Mamontov being sufficiently covered, the 21st Division, in its known and greater part, is to be transferred to the Southern Front with the double objective of catching Mamontov from the south and taking part in the fighting on the Southern Front.
3 I propose the following addenda to the decision of the Politbureau (measures against Mamontov): 1) appointment of chiefs of every section (10 to 30 versts, etc.
) in case of encirclement, of whom 1-2 to be Communists.
2) those refusing to leave the railway cars to be shot on the spot; 3) further draconian measures to tighten discipline.

” To which the Ambassador replied: “I proffer you a friendly hand and hope that you will help the whole of the East to free itself from the yoke of European imperialism.
” During the talk that followed, Lenin said that Soviet power, the power of the working people and the oppressed, was striving towards the very goal the Afghan Ambassador Extraordinary had spoken about, but that it was necessary that the Moslem East should realise this and help Soviet Russia in her great war of liberation.
To this the Ambassador replied that he could assert that the Moslem East realised this and the hour was not far off when the world would see that there was no room for European imperialism in the East.
Afterwards the Ambassador stood up and with the words: “I have the honour of presenting my Sovereign’s letter to the Head of the free Russian proletarian Government and hope that the Soviet Government will give due consideration to what the Afghan Government is writing about,” he handed Lenin the Amir’s letter.
Comrade Lenin answered that he accepted the letter with the greatest pleasure and promised shortly to give a reply to all the questions Afghanistan was interested in.

He expressed his conviction that the communist workers of Ivanovo-Voznesensk would be able to exercise a beneficial influence on the peasants in the front-line area and be a great help in conducting political work among the Cossacks.

2 3 2 and October 2 5 , 1 9 1 9 Printed from the Pravda text SPEECH TO ADULT-EDUCATION COURSE STUDENTS LEAVING FOR THE FRONT OCTOBER 28, 1919 The conference opened with a speech by Lenin.
He greeted the students of the courses, who had resolved to go out to the front to help the Red Army, and gave a vivid description of the present situation on all the fronts and in the enemy’s rear.
The bourgeoisie, both of Russia and the West, had begun to celebrate victory prematurely.
The Red troops were driving Kolchak before them.
Denikin was retreating from Orel.
There was demoralisation among the White troops.
In Denikin’s rear there were uninterrupted uprisings.
Today even the prosperous Cossacks were going against him.
Yudenich had scant forces, consisting mainly of Englishmen.
Britain had given him a large fleet.
Yudenich’s offensive was intended to save Denikin, draw our forces off, but his plan failed—the workers of Petrograd had displayedexamples of heroism.
Europe was tensely watching the outcome of the struggle.
The workers of France and Britain had already registered their protest against the attack upon Russia.
Bolshevism in these countries was gaining ground.
The elections in France were very significant in this respect.
157 Our chief attention was now directed to the Southern Front, where indescribably furious and sanguinary battles were raging, and where the fate of the revolution in the West as well as in Russia was being decided.
.
.
.
Danikin’s officer corps was well armed.
In view of the uprisings in their rear, they were putting up a desperate fight.
But the worker and peasant masses were beginning to see things clearer and there was a strong upsurge among them.
Our weakness was that we had too few knowledgeable organisers among the peasants and workers.
That was why we had so many old officials, saboteurs, etc.
, in our insti-tutions.
It was necessary to advance the best workers from among the people, and give them knowledge.
.
.
.
It was important to have social-minded people capable of talking to the peasants, people who would raise the morale of the army, and therefore everyone going to the front should show an example of bravery and selfless dedication.
Victory then will be ours.
We shall put transport in order and bring in grain.

While emphatically stressing our undeviating recognition of the right of the working masses of every nation to self-determination, the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs should vigorously protest against such conduct on the part of the Azerbaijan Government.

§ 4—absolutely arbitrary fixing of the standard (50%— exactly 50%—from “the best”, i.

Can’t we have it more exact? Publish standards for control? Or collect them for the scientific-technical department, etc.

Account of results: top limit of bonuses.
Accounts on this not provided for.
Will this not virtually legalise gross abuses? Consumers should be enlisted for standard control.
Are there any examples of this? Among the co-operatives? and so on.
The draft is too sweeping, abstract, unbusiness-like; promises everything, verifies nothing.
190 Lenin First published in 1 9 4 5 in Lenin Miscellany XXXV Printed from the manuscript SPEECH AT A CONFERENCE OF CHAIRMEN OF GUBERNIA AND UYEZD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEES FEBRUARY 1, 1920 At a meeting of executive committee chairmen preceding the opening of the session, 1 9 1 Lenin said, in dealing with the current situation: In so far as the international situation stays as it is, and the whole course of events points to its stability, the tasks of economic activities should be advanced by us to the fore.
As regards transport, we not only have to bringthis to the fore, but simply drag this transport out by the ears, save it from imminent disaster.
Trains carrying grain are stopping, we have more grain than we can transport.
Military operations are often impeded through lack of transport.
February is the most difficult month for transport, and we are simply heading for disaster.
We are threatened by a danger of transport dislocation more serious than in October, when Yudenich and Denikin were winning their biggest victories.
More energy must be applied to save transport.
We must carry out mobilisations here again and again.
We shall have to rob a number of institutions of their workers and keep on robbing them to combat the chaos in transport.
The whole art of government and policy-making consists in being able to assess and know in good time where to concentrate your main forces and attention.
We must now extricate transport in the course of two months.
Unless we work the same miracle in two months with transport as we have done with Kolchak, disaster threatens us.
A number of vigorous and revolutionary measures are needed.
This is a military and combat task and calls for combat action in military style.

194 Written February 5 , 1 9 2 0 First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXIV Printed from the manuscript SPEECH AT THE FOURTH CONFERENCE OF GUBERNIA EXTRAORDINARY COMMISSIONS 195 FEBRUARY 6, 1920 Comrades, you will now have to carry on your work under conditions when Soviet Russia is passing to a new phase of activities.
You all know, of course, that these conditions of the transition period are due both to interna-tional and internal conditions, or rather to the changedsituation both on the international and home fronts that has taken place recently.
The fundamental change is that the main forces of the whiteguard counter-revolution have been smashed after the defeat of Yudenich and Kolchak and after the victory over Denikin.
We have to be cautious, though, since a hitch has recently occurred near Rostov and at Novocherkassk, and there is a danger that Denikin may recover.
Nevertheless, the main victories create a new situation.
Obviously, the bourgeoisie cannot seriously count on things taking a turn in their favour, all the more as the international situation, too, has changed greatly, changed to such an extent that the Entente has been obliged to lift the blockade.
We have been able to conclude peace with Estonia.
In this respect we have achieved a basic success which has greatly strengthened our position, and we shall probably secure peace with all the other border states, and then an invasion by the Entente will practically be ruled out.
Thus, the first acute moment of our struggle with the counter-revolution, with the whiteguard armed force, both overt and covert—this first acute period is apparently passing.
It is more than likely, however, that attempts at one or another counter-revolutionary movement and revolt will be repeated, and, besides, the experience of the Russian revolutionary movement shows that attempts of a purely terrorist nature are often accompanied by a mass armed struggle, and therefore it is natural to expect that the counter-revolutionary armed officer force—an element probably most accustomed to handling and using arms—will not miss a chance to make use of these arms for their own ends.
So though the death sentence, after the capture of Rostov, has been abolished on Comrade Dzerzhinsky’s initiative, a reservation was made at the very beginning that we do not by any means close our eyes to the possibility of restoring capital punishment.
With us this is a matter of expediency.
It goes without saying that the Soviet government will not keep the death penalty longer than is absolutely necessary, and by doing away with it, has taken a step that no democratic government of any bourgeois republic has ever taken.
You are aware that the great majority of the workers and peasants in all the outlying districts, who were under the yoke of the whiteguards, have come over to our side.
The longer they were under that yoke the more strongly have they sided with us.
And so we know that all the attempts of the bourgeoisie are doomed to failure.
But that these attempts are possible, we know only too well from the two years’ experience of Soviet power.
We have seen tens of thousands of officers, landowner elements, stopping at no crimes, concluding agreements with the agents of imperialist foreign powers to blow up bridges.
And we say that attempts like these will go on.
With due consideration for the new general position of the state, we must nevertheless remain alert and remember that though the period of armed struggle on a big historical scale is coming to end, we must on no account exclude the possibility of our having to keep in a state of preparedness.
The problem set before the agencies of suppression of the counter-revolution, before the agencies of the Cheka, and still facing them today, is a complex and difficult one.
On the one hand, they must realise and make allowance for the transition from war to peace, and, on the other, they must be on guard all the time, since we do not know how long it will take to secure a lasting peace; we must take into account what effect this new approach will have on the bourgeois sections of the population, we must bear in mind, test in practice what these changes will yield, and only after all this has been taken into consideration, introduce one or another modification on the basis of such practical experience.
In a word, we must continue to keep fighting fit to be able to repulse the enemy.
There may possibly be attempts at invasion, Denikin may possibly fortify his position to continue the civil war, there may possibly be attempts at terror on the part of groups of counter-revolutionaries, and it is our duty to be always in fighting trim.
While keeping in fighting trim, keeping the apparatus for suppressing the resistance of the exploiters alerted, we must take into account the new transition from war to peace and gradually change our tactics, change the nature of repressive measures.
This question, I believe, played no small part in your discussions, and you, of course, have much more to go on than I have in the matter of practical concrete decisions.
I have no doubt that you will try to study this material in a concrete, practical way.
You must work out in what direction the agencies for suppressing the counter-revolution are to modify their activities in the recently liberated parts of Russia, in Siberia and the Ukraine, how, in keeping with this, we are to change our activities.
I shall not go into details or enlarge on this, because I have not had a chance to study the factual material, but I repeat—the important thing is to take into account the concrete facts that have come to light in the work of every Cheka.
Moreover, the aim of such conferences is to enable you to discuss the factual material in greatest possible detail, so that local workers should not shut themselves up in their own narrow circle, but should be able, as a result of such an exchange of opinions, to devise more durable and lasting tactics.
I should like in particular to draw attention to a question that now confronts the agencies of suppression of the counter-revolution, the agencies combating espionage and profiteering, namely, to the bloodless front of labour, a question that is now becoming a key issue in the building up of Soviet power, in the strengthening of the workers’ and peasants’ rule and the revival of the ruined economy.
You know that the task of fighting Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin, who have been supported by the Entente, the task of fighting the counter-revolutionary landowners and capitalists who were convinced up till now that their victory was secure, since the wealthiest Powers in the world were on their side—this task called for an exertion of all the country’s strength, because the very existence of the Soviet Republic was at stake.
During these two years Soviet power can be said to have accomplished what is nothing short of a miracle, for in the struggle against international capital we have succeeded in winning such an incredible, such an amazing victory as the world has never known.
This has happened because all our forces were closely united, because we had a real dicta-torship of the proletariat in action in the sense that the vanguard, the best advance guard of the working class during these two years of Soviet government displayed unheard-of heroism and determination, while all the vacillating elements among the less developed section of the working class and the peasantry, who went through a long range of fluctuations, found themselves leaning more and more to our side.
The more trials they went through, the sooner did they side with us.
To achieve such a concentration of forces we had to resort to measures of coercion in face of all the lamentations, regrets and complaints.
Both before and after the October Revolution we held the view that the birth of a new order was impossible without revolutionary coercion, that all the regrets and complaints that we hear from non-Party petty-bourgeois intellectuals are simply reactionary.
History, which is propelled by a fierce class struggle, has shown that when the landowners and capitalists felt that it was a question of the last decisive fight, they stopped at nothing.
History has shown that without revolutionary coercion victory cannot be achieved.
Without revolutionary coercion directed against the avowed enemies of the workers and peasants, it is impossible to break down the resistance of these exploiters.
On the other hand, revolutionary coercion is bound to be employed towards the wavering and unstable elements among the masses themselves.
Today we are witnessing the tremendous victory of the Red Army, but if we look back over the last two years of Soviet government and think of how we advanced towards these victories, we are bound to remember that the October Revolution started when the army was completely de-moralised and there was a complete absence of any military organisation.
We had no army, and were obliged to scrape one together, to weld, muster and build this army up anew by long hard work.
And in building up this new disciplined Red Army we had to resort to revolutionary coercion.
And this revolutionary coercion was quite rightly applied to self-seeking elements.
At a time when the advanced section of the population were giving all their strength to the fight against the counter-revolution, at a time when thousands of them, with the greatest self-sacrifice, were laying down their lives on the fields of battle, the backward elements among the peasantry who had received land, and thebackward elements among the workers, were working only for themselves.
At that time the advanced elements had to build up and strengthen the new discipline, which was maintained by revolutionary coercion and which could be so maintained only because the public-spirited section of the workers and peasants, of all the working masses, sympathised with this coercion, realised that without this iron discipline we could not have built up the Red Army, could not have held our own in the two years of struggle and generally could not have stood up against organised and united capital.
In this respect, the tasks of cultivating discipline, maintain-ing discipline and rallying our forces to face the coming struggle—these tasks are now gradually being modified.
At first we gave all our forces to the war, all the forces of the ruined country.
This condemned the country to still greater ruin.
No one believed two years ago that Russia, a country ravaged by four years of imperialist war, could withstand another two years of civil war.
In fact, if we were asked at the end of October 1917 whether we would survive two years of civil war against the world’s bourgeoisie, I doubt whether many of us would have answered in the affirmative.
Events, however, have shown that the energy which the worker and peasant masses developed proved to be greater than the people who had made the October Revolution believed.
As a result, we have received—and the home fronts have shown us—a source of new strength considerably greater than anything we had counted on.
At the same time this source has shown that the Red Army, which is capable of winning victories on the war fronts, is meeting with new obstacles on the home fronts—this is particularly the case in transport.
Of course, things are bad with us as regards food, too, cold and hunger are worse than ever now, but with the liberation of the richest grain-producing gubernias the food situation is improving, and our chief crisis now is transport.
It should be said that the same crisis exists in all the richest countries, who have never experienced such a long war.
Even these countries are suffering from a shortage of railway cars.
So you can imagine what is hap-pening with us in Russia, who has been at war six years and had had her bridges and locomotives deliberately destroyed.
Our position, in this respect, is a very difficult one, of course, and the task of the Cheka’s transport departments, of their whole organism, the efforts of all the revolutionary social-minded masses, are aimed at helping the country to extricate itself from this critical plight, which without exaggeration can be said to verge on catastrophe.
Another thing to be borne in mind is that the state of the railways in February, what with the winter snowdrifts, is always worse, even during ordinary times, than at any other season.
At present our transport crisis has reached a stage when the railways are threatened with a complete stoppage.
Lately, Moscow has had only a three-day supply of bread, while dozens of trains have been held up through lack of fuel.
We are well aware of the methods for coping with this disastrous situation, which we have been using during two years of war.
These methods are—raising the social conscious-ness of the masses and appealing directly to them.
In every such crisis we deemed it our duty to appeal to the worker and peasant masses and describe to them the difficult situation that had arisen.
We appealed to them and pointed out on whom the salvation of Soviet Russia depended and what effort was needed to concentrate on a single definite task.
These tasks often changed while Soviet power was engaged in fighting its enemies, and a proper understanding of the state’s position depends upon the ability to grasp what tasks have to be tackled in order to cope with the economic chaos and pass on to the normal work of economic organi-sation.
Now, too, you know that most attention was given to explaining the critical position of the railways to the workers and peasants.
A tremendous effort is needed here on the part of the proletariat and the peasantry.
Such a thing as the delivery of fuel is a difficult problem, which cannot possibly be coped with unless the worker and peasant population give themselves to the task with enthusiasm, unless there is a spurt of collective mass effort such as we witnessed during the best period of the Red Army’s victories.
Today, for example, the delivery of fuel and the clearing of railway tracks meet with difficulties arising from the fact that the peasants were given a number of promises to compensate them for their food products.
Naturally,deliveries require draft horses, and the peasants out there are unable to provide these, they are very unwilling and unfriendly, as they do not receive compensation in the way of a definite amount of goods; and we, owing to the almost complete stoppage of transport, are not in a position to give them any commodities worth speaking of.
We say that the peasants should do this as a loan to their workers’ and peasants’ state in order to save the starving workers and put industry on its feet.
The peasants should give this loan, because, for instance, in some places the peasantry are suffering terribly from a shortage of salt, while we have enormous stocks of this salt which we are unable to deliver since the railways do not cope with the task of transporting the absolutely essential amount of breadstuffs.
We have here a situation that calls for still greater discipline, for propaganda and agitation to educate and unite all the workers and peasants.
The use of revolutionary coercion turns this discipline into something real and definite, showing that the class-conscious working class has set itself a definite practical task, which we shall see through to its conclusion.
Just as in the period of our most difficult struggle against Yudenich, Kolchak and Denikin, when we advanced Communists, leading workers, to the front ranks, made great sacrifices, giving the lives of our best fighters and at the same time building up discipline and punishing self-seekers—we achieved the maximum exertion of the people’s energy, and we won; so today, too, we must set ourselves the same aim and achieve it at all costs by the same methods if we are to save transport.
We have grain, salt, we have sufficient quantities of raw materials and fuel, we can put industry back on its feet, but this will take months of hard efforts, and in these efforts the agencies of the Cheka must become an instrument for carrying out the centralised will of the proletariat, an instrument of discipline such as we succeeded in creating in the Red Army.
And I am sure that after this meeting, in the practical work of your agencies, and here, too, you will come to an understanding of the role the uyezd transport departments of the Cheka are to play, of the way they should organise their work, how they should advance new people from theirmidst in order to fight the profiteers and saboteurs, who are more numerous among the railwaymen than anywhere else.
This is a task of your practical experience, a task you will have to carry out by way of an exchange of opinions.
The railways are notable in that we have there a majority of workers on a working-class level and a minority who engage in profiteering, and here it is the task of the Transport Cheka to secure a correct division of labour, responsibility for economising labour power, and secure all this through the efforts of the communist elements among the railwaymen.
Only by relying on these best masses shall we be able to create a force that will cope with profiteers and gain the upper hand over these elements, recruited during the worst days of tsarism.
To overcome this force inherited by us from capitalism we have one means—that of tightening discipline and developing revolutionary energy to the utmost.
The Cheka should rely on the communist groups, on the trade unions—combine its work with propaganda and agitation, evoke among the bulk of the railwaymen a con-scious attitude towards this struggle.
And I am sure that by strict organisation and with our previous experience to go on, we shall achieve in our work results as good as those we achieved in the armed struggle.

197 Written February 6 , 1 9 2 0 First published in 1 9 4 5 in Lenin Miscellany XXXV Printed from the manuscript INTERVIEW WITH LINCOLN EYRE, CORRESPONDENT OF THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPER T H E W O R L D 198 ALLIES PLAYING “CHESS GAME” Of the Allies’ reported decision to lift the blockade Lenin said: “It is hard to see sincerity behind so vague a proposal, coupled as it seems to be with preparations to attack us.
afresh through Poland.
At first glance the Supreme Council’s proposition looks plausible enough—the resumption of commercial relations through the medium of the Russian co-operatives.
But the co-operatives do not any longer exist, having been assimilated into our Soviet distribution organs.
Therefore what is meant when the Allies talk of dealing with the co-operatives? Certainly it is not clear.
“Therefore I say that closer examination convinces us that this Paris decision is simply a move in the Allied chess game the motives of which are still obscure.
” Lenin paused a moment, then added with a broad grin: “Far obscurer, for instance, than Marshal Foch’s intended visit to Warsaw.
” I asked if he deemed the probability of a Polish offensive serious (it must be recalled that in Russia the talk was of a drive by the Poles against the Bolsheviki, not vice versa).
“Beyond doubt,” Lenin replied, “Clemenceau and Foch are very, very serious gentlemen, and the one originated and the other is going to carry out this offensive scheme.
It is a grave menace, of course, but we have faced graver ones.
It does not cause us fear so much as disappointment that the Allies should still pursue the impossible.
For a Polish offensive can no more settle the Russian problem for them than did Kolchak’s and Denikin’s.
Poland has many troubles of her own, remember.
And it is obvious that she can get no help from any of her neighbours, including Roumania.
” “Yet peace seems nearer than before,” I suggested.
“Yes, that’s true.
If peace is a corollary of trade with us, the Allies cannot avoid it much longer.
I have heard that Millerand, Clemenceau’s successor, expresses willingness to envisage commercial relations with the Russian people.
Perhaps this heralds a change of front among the French capitalists.
But Churchill is still strong in England, and Lloyd George, who probably wants to do business with us, dare not risk an open rupture with the political and financial interests supporting the Churchill policy.
” UNITED STATES OPPRESSES SOCIALISTS “And America?” “It is hard to see clearly what is going on there.
Your bankers seem to fear us more than ever.
At any rate, your Government is instituting more violently repressive measures not only against the socialists but against the working class in general than any other government, even the reactionary French.
Apparently it is persecuting foreigners.
And yet, what would America be without her foreign workers? They are an absolute necessity to your economic development .
“Still, some American manufacturers appear to have begun to realise that making money in Russia is wiser than making war against Russia, which is a good sign.
We shall need American manufactures—locomotives, automobiles, etc.
—more than those of any other country.
”“And your peace terms?” “It is idle to talk further about them,” Lenin returned emphatically.
“All the world knows that we are prepared to make peace on terms the fairness of which even the most imperialistic capitalists could not dispute.
We have reiterated and reiterated our desire for peace, our need for peace and our readiness to give foreign capital the most generous concessions and guarantees.
But we do not propose to be strangled to death for the sake of peace.
“I know of no reason why a socialistic commonwealth like ours cannot do business indefinitely with capitalistic countries.
We don’t mind taking their capitalistic locomo-tives and farming machinery, so why should they mind taking our socialistic wheat, flax and platinum.
Socialistic corn tastes the same as any other corn, does it not? Of course, they will have to have business relations with the dreadful Bolsheviks—that is, the Soviet Government.
But it should not be harder for American steel manufacturers, for instance, to deal with the Soviets than it was for them to deal with Entente governments in their war-time munition deals.
” EUROPE DEPENDENT ON RUSSIA “That is why this talk of reopening trade with Russia through co-operatives seems to us insincere, or at least, obscure—a move in a game of chess rather than a frank, straightforward proposition that would be immediately grasped and acted upon.
Moreover, if the Supreme Council really means to lift the blockade, why doesn’t it tell us of its intentions? We are without official word from Paris.
What little we know is derived from newspaper despatches picked up by our wireless.
“The statesmen of the Entente and the United States do not seem to understand that Russia’s present economic distress is simply a part of the world’s economic distress.
Until the economic problem is faced from a world standpoint and not merely from the standpoint of certain nations or group of nations, a solution is impossible.
Without Russia, Europe cannot get on her feet.
And with Europe prostrate, America’s position becomes critical.
What good is America’s wealth if she cannot buy with it that which she needs?America cannot eat or wear the gold she has accumulated, can she? She can’t trade profitably, that is, on a basis that will be of real value to her, with Europe until Europe is able to give her the things she wants in exchange for that which she has to give.
And Europe cannot give her those things until she is on her feet economically.
” WORLD NEEDS RUSSIAN GOODS “In Russia we have wheat, flax, platinum, potash and many minerals of which the whole world stands in desperate need.
The world must come to us for them in the end, Bolshevism or no Bolshevism.
There are signs that a reali-sation of this truth is gradually awakening.
But meanwhile not only Russia but all Europe is going to pieces, and the Supreme Council still indulges in tergiversation.
Russia can be saved from utter ruin and Europe too, but it must be done soon and quickly.
And the Supreme Council is so slow, so very slow.
In fact, it has already been dissolved, I believe, in favour of a Council of Ambassadors, leaving nothing settled and with only a League of Nations which is nonexistent, still-born, to take its place.
How can the League of Nations possibly come to life without the United States to give it backbone!” I inquired as to whether the Soviet Government was satisfied with the military situation.
“Very much so,” Lenin replied promptly.
“The only symptoms of further military aggression against us are those I spoke of in Poland.
If Poland embarks on such an adventure there will be more suffering on both sides, more lives needlessly sacrificed.
But even Foch could not give the Poles a victory.
They could not defeat our Red Army even if Churchill himself fought with them.
” Here Lenin threw back his head and laughed grimly.
Then he went on in a graver vein: “We can be crushed, of course, by any one of the big Allied Powers if they can send their own armies against us.
But that they dare not do.
The extraordinary paradox is that weak as Russia is compared with the Allies’ boundlessresources she has not only been able to shatter every armed force, including British, American and French troops that they have managed to send against her, but to win diplomatic and moral victories as well over the cordon sanitaire countries.
Finland refused to fight against us.
We have peace with Estonia, and peace with Serbia * and Lithuania 199 is at hand.
Despite material inducements offered to and sinister threats made against these small countries by the Entente, they preferred to establish pacific relations with us.
” INTERNAL SITUATION HOPEFUL “This assuredly demonstrates the tremendous moral force we hold.
The Baltic states, our nearest neighbours, appreciate that we alone have no designs against their independence and well-being.
” “And Russia’s internal situation?” “It is critical but hopeful.
With spring the food shortage will be overcome to the extent at least of saving the cities from famine.
There will be sufficient fuel then too.
The reconstruction period is under way, thanks to the Red Army’s stupendous performances.
Now parts of that army are transformed into armies of labour, an extraordinary phenomenon only possible in a country struggling toward a high ideal.
Certainly it could not be done in capitalist countries.
We have sacrificed everything to victory over our armed antagonists in the past; and now we shall turn all our strength to economic rehabilitation.
It will take years, but we shall win out in the end.
” “When do you think Communism will be complete in Russia?” The question was a poser, I thought, but Lenin replied immediately: “We mean to electrify our entire industrial system through power stations in the Urals and elsewhere.
Our engineers tell us it will take ten years.
When the electrifica-tion is accomplished it will be the first important stage on the road to the communistic administration of public * This is a mistake on the part of the newspaper.
Serbia was not at war with Soviet Russia.
This obviously refers to Latvia.

economic life.
All our industries will receive their motive power from a common source, capable of supplying them all adequately.
This will eliminate wasteful competition in the quest of fuel, and place manufacturing enterprise on a sound economic footing, without which we cannot hope to achieve a full measure of interchange of essential products in accordance with Communist principles.
“Incidentally, in three years we expect to have 50,000,000 incandescent lamps burning in Russia.
There are 70,000,000 in the United States, I believe, but in a land where electricity is in its infancy more than two-thirds of that number is a very high figure to achieve.
Electrification is to my mind the most momentous of the great tasks that confront us.
” SCORES SOCIALIST LEADERS At the close of our talk Lenin delivered himself, not for publication, however, of some cutting criticism of certain Socialist leaders in Europe and America which revealed his lack of faith in the ability or even desire of these gentry to promote world revolution effectively.
He evidently feels that Bolshevism will come to pass in spite of, rather than because of, the “official” chieftains of Socialism.

C.
All work to improve the organisation and management of the state farms should be centred on strongly combating, first, the patently landowner-type abuses that have come to light in the application of money rent, métayage, and so on; secondly, the extremely low labour discipline and extremely low productivity of labour.
Exact information to be demanded of the gubernia land departments and state farms as to what measures they have taken in this direction and what practical results they have achieved.
Responsible persons to be appointed answerable before a court of law for the carrying out of this decision and the elimination of abuses.
If need be, the entire managing personnel of the worst farms should be replaced.
Certain farms should be selected as specialised model farms of a producing or purely consuming type and data concerning the state of these farms to be recorded separately.

U.
Party group signed by Tomsky and Lutovinov and found in their presence 1) that Comrade Krestinsky, in private conversations with Comrades Ishchenko, Glebov, Tomsky and Lutovinov, did not voice his misgivings about the awkwardness of the existing relations (namely, the sponsoring by members of the Party at non-Party con-gresses—and not at their communist groups—of resolutions that differ from the resolution of the C.

2) that Comrade Krestinsky had suggested that this question should not be dealt with by the Party group before its forthcoming discussion the next day at the Politbureau in the presence of members of the Party group’s bureau; 3) that during these conversations Comrade Krestinsky had been rather hasty; on the other hand, that under the circumstances the discussion of this question at the Party group was highly out of place and bound to aggravate the conflict needlessly, or rather turn the difference of opinion between the C.

Considering the quite exceptional circumstances, however (namely, the very early date of the forthcoming Party congress, the publication of Comrade Tomsky’s theses, and the comparatively minor importance of the still moot question of collective management with or without one-man management in separate cases) it is recognised as a politically lesser evil that members of the A.

I would prefer, in lieu of a short preface, to give a detailed analysis of one of the writings of J.
Ramsay Macdonald, who, as far as I know, is one of the most influential and widely read of English writers of practically the same Kautskyan trend.
Unfortunately, I was unable to obtain Macdonald’s book Parliament and Revolution 208 which has short chapters on Soviet democracy and Soviet suffrage,but the author’s Kautskyan point of view is quite clear from his article “Socialist Review Outlook” published in The Socialist Review, October-December 1919, of which he is the editor.
Macdonald is not a Marxist, and the Marxist-tinted opportunism characteristic of Kautsky is not typical of England.
As I have no time just now to give a detailed analysis of Macdonald’s views, I shall confine myself to an attempt at briefly describing his views as known to us from his political activities, from the newspaper of his party (the “Independent” Labour Party—independent in word and fully dependent on bourgeois prejudices in deed), from his magazine and in particular from the article just mentioned.
I shall first quote some of the most characteristic passages from this article: Describing the general political situation, Macdonald writes: “.
.
.
Never was honest service and labour held in lower esteem” (p.
306).
“ .
.
.
Our ships of war continuing the starvation of women and children.
We are in every mean and wicked conspiracy to subvert democracy in Europe.
Though the State is tottering on the verge of bankruptcy, a Minister to gratify his personal vanity, and a small class of finan-ciers to secure personal profit in the future, can add what will probably amount to £100,000,000 further burden upon the British taxpayer, for a Russian venture .
.
.
” (p.
307).
“The storm in the teacup inside the Parliamentary Labour Party, because Mr.
Neil MacLean remained seated during a theatrical display when the Prime Minister was being welcomed for bringing in his pocket from Paris one of the worst in-struments that ever terminated a war, shows this same proneness ? in the Party to be stampeded by trivial fears.
” “The Labour Party has to save itself from chastisement; it cannot allow handbills to be issued against its candidates, headed: ‘The Labour Party condones an insult to our Gracious Sovereign.
’ ” “Such a state of things,” declares brave Mr.
Macdonald, “is not healthy; it contains no promise of great reform.

2 Title suggestions: “Decree on Greater Uniformity of Food Rations and Work Rations As the Basis of the Whole Food System”.
What was formerly called “general public norm” to be changed to “norm for unemployed and small proprietors” or: self-employed citizens, people not working, etc.
(or “small proprietors”), “people not working in Soviet enterprises or offices”.
Advantage: (1) simplifies things tremendously in capital cities and all non-farming, industrial towns (as the bulk there work in Soviet enterprises or Soviet offices).
(2) In non-industrial towns we clearly set apart the population that is not working in Soviet enterprises or Soviet offices, and this population should gradually be taken off rations (either start a vegetable garden of your own or go to work in Soviet enterprises or Soviet offices).
We shall not feed those who do not work in Soviet enterprises or Soviet offices.
Figure out under what system there will be less food coupons and the system itself more simple.

I.
Lenin delivered a short but impressive speech on the significance of Karl Marx as a socialist leader.
“The working people were enslaved, despite political liberties.
Now they are moving towards the workers’ revolu-tion, which will create a socialist society without landowners and capitalists.
To Russia has fallen the great honour and joy of helping to establish this socialist society and a world Soviet Republic.
Today, on this international festival of labour, when we wish to prove to everybody that we shall succeed in coping with the task of organising a socialist society of the working people, we honour the memory of Karl Marx.
And I am confident that the laying of this monument to our great teacher will serve as a call impelling us to give all our attention to the need for working hard and long to create a society in which there will be no room for exploitation.

Already in those days Comrade Zagorsky, who was secretary of the Geneva group of Bolsheviks, impressed one as being an energetic, clever man and a good organiser devoted heart and soul to the cause of the Party.
When Zagorsky returned to Moscow in 1918 he threw himself into Party work and was shortly elected secretary of the Moscow organisation, at which honourable post he died during the explosion in Leontievsky Pereulok.

A Red commander should remember that we were fighting, not the Polish workers and peasants, but the Polish bourgeoisie and landowners, as well as the capitalists of the Entente whostood behind them and controlled the Polish landed gentry.
You know, Comrade Lenin said, that this war has been forced on us against our desire, but we are not going to let ourselves be crushed: better death than defeat.

First published in 1 9 4 5 in Lenin Miscellany XXXV Printed from the manuscriptINTERVIEW WITH M.
NAKAHIRA, CORRESPONDENT OF THE JAPANESE NEWSPAPER OSAKA ASAHI 216 He did not wait for our question, but started to speak of the relations between Japan and Russia—to the effect that it is regrettable that Japan does not seem willing to adopt an attitude of willingness to meet the Soviet Government’s attitude of peace.
The Soviet Government stands for peace, and therefore it recognises the neutral zone government.
217 He then asked: “Is there a powerful landowning class in Japan? Does the Japanese farmer own land freely? Do the Japanese people live on food produced in their own country, or do they import much food from foreign countries?” He asked many other questions, showing his deep interest in living conditions in Japan.
Mr.
Lenin next asked whether Japanese parents beat their children, and said he had read of this in a book.
“Tell me whether it is true or not,” said he, “it is a very interesting subject.
” I answered that there may be exceptions, but as a rule parents do not beat their children in Japan.
On hearing my answer he expressed satisfaction and said that the policy of the Soviet Government is to abolish this condition.
After that we asked about the revolution and subsequent developments.
In giving a résumé of Russian revolutionary history, he said: “Before the revolution, the working and peasant classes of Russia were extremely oppressed—in fact, their oppression was without parallel in past history.
As a result of this most severe oppression, the revolutionary spirit of the poorer class gradually increased until it broke out in the revolution.
But the organising capacity of the lower strata of Russia is comparatively weak and the degree of education lower than in any other countries.
In spite of all this they could not be suppressed.
But now, after two and a half years of experience, the Russian working and peasant masses have obtained a great deal of political and social discipline.
The experience of this two and a half years can truly be compared with the development of several centuries.
”At this point we asked why the Soviet Republic, in spite of its having repudiated the national debts of czarism, had promised to give Esthonia vast amounts of gold, when concluding peace.
Smiling, Mr.
Lenin said: “Esthonia has shown her good will toward the Soviet Government and therefore the Soviet Government has promised to pay her this gold.
Moreover,” he continued, “to deal with the propertied class is really a very difficult matter.
The propertied class cares for nothing but its own material interests.
For instance, look at America.
America proposed a peace treaty with Soviet Russia.
When we examined the treaty, we could not accept it because it was based on exploitation.
So we rejected it.
Of course we do not consider ourselves incapable.
The Allied nations, rejecting recognition, attempt to interfere with Russia.
There is reason to think that if the intervention of the Allies should continue, it will be profitable to the Bolsheviki.
“All in all, considering the prospects of Russia’s indus-tries, the situation is promising.
If our electrical programme is attained entire industries can be electrified.
The creative capacity of communism will be increased and will exert the greatest influence in solving these problems, and the development will be equal to that of several decades.

9 1 Printed from the text in Osaka Asahi Translated from the Japanese INTERVIEW WITH K.
FUSSE, CORRESPONDENT OF THE JAPANESE NEWSPAPERS OSAKA MAINICHI AND TOKYO NICHI -NICHI Lenin said on meeting Fusse that he was very glad to see him and that despite everything that had taken place in recent years between Russia and Japan and the fact thatsome people in Japan still took an uncompromising attitude towards Soviet Russia, he nevertheless took an optimistic view of future relations between the two countries.
The Soviet Government had recognised the independence of the buffer state and “this, I hope,” said Lenin, “would help restore peace in the Far East in the very near future.
” Fusse started the interview by asking Lenin: “Last autumn you said the difficulties were over.
Don’t you foresee big difficulties ahead?” I meant that our greatest difficulties were over; but, of course, there are still many difficulties confronting us.
Fusse: “You said it took capitalism many years to accomplish the transition from feudalism, therefore it would also take socialism many years to accomplish the transition from capitalism.
Approxi-mately how long do you think this will take?” Generally, it is hard to fix dates; to overthrow the old order doesn’t require much time, but you can’t create the new order in a short time.
We have launched our plan for the electrification of industry and agriculture; without electrification the communist order is impracticable, and our plan of electrification is designed for a period of ten years under the most favourable conditions.
That’s the shortest time we set for building up our new order.
Lenin then asked Fusse a number of questions concerning agrarian and class relations in Japan.
What kind of landowners does Japan have? What is the position of the landless peasant in Japan? Are there any peasant organisations? and so on.
Lenin also showed an interest in the state of electrification and public education in Japan and how children were treated in Japan.
When Fusse said that Japan took better care of her children than the West, Lenin remarked: “That’s very important, in view of the fact that the practice of beating children in the schools has not yet been entirely eliminated in the so-called civilised countries of Europe, not even in a country like Switzerland.
” After this Fusse again asked Lenin a number of political questions.
Fusse: “How do you visualise good-neighbourly relations between socialist and capitalist states?” Our terms of coexistence with capitalist countries were set forth at length in the draft treaty which the Americanrepresentative, Mr.
Bullitt, recently published in Washington.
These terms wore most unfavourable to us, and it was this that led the Allied governments to believe that our willingness to make concessions was a sign of weakness, and they started their intervention, as a result of which they suffered complete defeat.
We routed Kolchak, Yudenich and Denikin.
Fusse: “Where does communism have more chance of success— in the West or in the East?” So far, real communism can succeed only in the West, but it must be remembered that the West lives at the expense of the East; the imperialist powers of Europe grow rich chiefly at the expense of the eastern colonies, but at the same time they are arming their colonies and teaching them to fight, and by so doing the West is digging its own grave in the East.
Fusse: “What are the immediate tasks of the Soviet Government?” First, to beat the Polish landowners, second, to secure a lasting peace, and then, third, to develop our econom-ic life.

For causing damage to Soviet property I order Comrade Vever, Manager of the Sanatorium at the Soviet Gorki Estate, to be placed under arrest for 1 month.
Sentence to be executed by the Podolsk Uyezd Executive Committee on the understanding that (1) should it be discovered that Comrade Vever had had no penalties previously imposed upon him, his sentence shall be suspended after a week’s detention and he shall be warned that in the event of wrongful felling in the park, walks or woods or any other damage to Soviet property being allowed, he will be liable to further punishment over and above 3 weeks’ arrest and to dismissal.
(2) The date on which sentence is to be carried out shall be determined by the Uyezd Executive Committee by arrangement with the Uyezd Land Department or the Management of the State Farms to ensure that farm work will not suffer in any way.
I instruct Comrade Belenky to bring this decision to the notice of Comrade Vever and his assistants, who are to sign that it has been announced to them and that any further similar offence will incur punishment for all workers and office staff, and not the manager alone.
I instruct the Uyezd Executive Committee to report to me what date they have fixed for the arrest and how the sentence has been carried out.

It means every day, in propaganda, agitation,speeches and articles, to prepare the proletariat for the conquest of power, for the suppression of the exploiters, the suppression of all the proletariat’s opponents.
Comrade Lenin, on the basis of various documents and newspapers, showed what a gulf existed between the Third International and the entire policy of the French Party.
218 He revealed all the rottenness of the Turatian wing of the Italian Party, which was preventing the party from adopting a correct line.

(B .
) SEPTEMBER ùù-ù5, 19ù0 242 1 SPEECH ON THE IMMEDIATE TASKS OF PARTY DEVELOPMENT SEPTEMBER 24 Comrades, I think that certain statements made during the debates and even certain speeches are worth mentioning if only because they obviously express not just overstrain, but overstrain bordering on hysteria and therefore giving a misplaced emphasis.
I would not call it demagogy.
It is physical overstrain to the point of hysteria.
This applies mainly to the speeches by Lutovinov and Bubnov, in which there was less of demagogy than of overstrain.
To some extent I think there were signs of overstrain in Medvedev’s statement too.
He said: “Now you have all started speaking about unhealthy symptoms, but before you used to deny it, you weren’t telling the truth.
” I think this explanation is not quite correct, in fact it is quite incorrect.
That the unhealthy symptoms we are talking about really exist—was hardly a secret.
Without a doubt, the general situation was so grave that we couldn’t find time till now for the Party, we had no chance to raise this question specially in the Party.
Even now we raise it with difficulty, because the chance we are discussing here in our political talk—the chance of our being able to avoid a winter campaign—is extremely slender.
The general situation of the Republic, as I mentioned, has improved to such an extent that we are now able to discuss things more calmly: there is no longer any question of suspending the conference the way we did several times when Kolchak and Denikin were advancing.
There were Party congresses from which a number of leading workers went straight off to the front without waiting for them to end.
Mind you, we seldom convene congresses, we seldom have a chance of discussing important issues at congresses—yet before we couldn’t even see a congress through to the end, rarely though it was convened.
Today at any rate we can and ought to thresh things out without restricting ourselves.
I should also like to say a word about Kalinin’s attempts to present the case in a Marxist way.
It seems to me that his arguments were a long step away from Marxism, and the correct Marxist view I think was given in the resolution of the Moscow Commit-tee—which you have all, of course, read and which has been put out in a small pamphlet and printed in Pravda— and the letter of the Central Committee.
I should like to read out several lines, which I would offer to the committee (if it be decided to set one up), not in lieu of the Moscow resolution and the C.
C.
’s letter, but as supplementary material to them.
* The resolution of the Moscow Committee I think—and all are agreed on this— deals with the question correctly.
Allow me to quote those few words and dwell on them briefly.
Here is the addendum: “The indescribably grave position of the Soviet Republic in the early years of its existence, extreme devastation and grave military danger, made it necessary to designate special “shock” (and therefore virtually privileged) departments and groups of workers.
This was unavoidable, since the ruined country could not be saved unless resources and energies were concentrated on such departments and such groups of workers, without the strengthening of which the imperialists of the whole world would have certainly crushed us and prevented the Soviet Republic from even starting on economic construction.
.
.
.
” As regards the old specialists we have heard some very heated attacks here.
The truth came out in Comrade Kutuzov’s speech when he said that the proletariat saw no improvement of its position from Soviet Russia—if anything, it was often worse.
That’s true.
But one must sort out the facts—for instance, that in Vienna, where there is no Soviet government, you have the same deterioration, to which you can add a moral humiliation a hundred times worse.
But the rank and file cannot get this straight.
Understand-ably, we are asked: What did we get in the course of these two years? And obviously, dissatisfaction with the old * See pp.
212-13 of this volume.
—Ed.
specialists is widespread.
Naturally, the question whether we need specialists or not was a salient issue.
We shouldn’t forget, however, that without them we would not have had our army.
We would have found ourselves in the same position as Hungary and the Finnish workers.
That is how the matter stands.
Without these specialists—I spoke about this in my political report—we would not have been able to take those elementary steps that helped us rise to a definite level.
If we had failed to cope with this specialist business, we would not have had this, we would not have been able to make further progress.
But now, when we have taken them in hand and harnessed them, when we know that they will not run away from us, but, on the contrary, are all running to join us, we shall now be sure that democratisation in the Party and the army will rise.
I shall read further (reads the resolution).
.
.
.
Point one (reads).
* Here there is an addition.
Comrade Tomsky said, referring to what we have often spoken about ourselves, that the rank and file should be brought to the fore, the leaders are tired, give the rank and file a chance.
This could not be done at once, but it will be after another, maybe the twentieth, attempt.
Failing this, Soviet Russia’s cause would be hopeless.
But we know that it is not hopeless, because we have new elements that are growing up.
If the first attempts failed, we shall try and try again.
Point two (reads).
* Here a rather sarcastic question was asked as to whether freedom of criticism would correspond to freedom to eat peaches.
243 I have one measure as a possible guarantee, on the basis of the proposals made by the committee.
At moments when the country is in danger, when Kolchak reached the Volga and Denikin Orel, there can be no freedoms.
There are other things than this to be regretted.
But the military situation is bad now, too, we see how fickle the fortunes of war are.
We must put this question on the order of the day.
But we cannot, we must not, promise that at moments of military danger we shall not act differently.
We shall have to make a tremendous * See p.
213 of this volume.
—Ed.
effort again and no arguing about it, we shall have to stand firm, strain every nerve.
We do not renounce this at all, and until we have an Italian victory we must not renounce it.
And that’s my reply to the peaches.
Point three (reads).
* Here Comrade Preobrazhensky raised a question which Zinoviev raised too: Is regulation appropriate here and what is to be understood by it? I shall leave this question open, as it will be detailed in the committee.
We shall see whether regulation is to be understood as detailed points or as the setting up of special bodies.
Point four (reads).
* The speaker here said that this question had been raised by the committee but was rejected by its majority.
I believe I am putting this forward only in my own name—I believe that it should not be rejected, and if not accepted at once, at least it should first be considered.
It has been pointed out here that 500 complaints have accumulated in the Orgbureau of the C.
C.
The Orgbureau has to distribute tens of thousands of people.
Besides, there is not a single member of the Orgbureau who is not swamped with work, doing several jabs.
Under these conditions one has to work with unknown quantities, and under such conditions you can only decide questions by intuition, a thing only experienced people can do, and even they often make mistakes.
Taking into consideration these conditions, we want to find people with a length of Party membership of not less than fifteen years, who enjoy the Party’s trust, who are unbiassed, and who would help in this business, while at the same time standing above the Orgbureau as regards independence, as they would be elected by the congress.
I believe this step could be taken.
To hamper the C.
C.
’s work or hold up the decision is impossible.
There is no special provision for it, and we cannot offer it.
There used to be a control commission in the German Workers’ Party.
How far that will be possible in our war situation—one cannot say.
In any case we are in a position to take such a step, and the C.
C.
has taken that course.
The C.
C.
’s letter says: “Special Party commissions to handle relevant complaints should be organised at all * See p.
213 of this volume.
—Ed.
Gubernia Party Committees and made up of the most dispas-sionate comrades enjoying the general trust of the organisa-tion.
” It speaks here of dispassionate comrades.
For real militant activities—military, economic and organisational— passionate people are very often absolutely necessary, because without high passion they will not be able to work at high pressure, they will not solve the urgent problem facing the exhausted country.
On the contrary, what we need here are people, who though they may not possess conspicuous administrative abilities, have a good knowledge of life.
I doubt whether we shall be able to find enough of them for the whole of Russia, for all gubernias, and if the commissions which are now going to be set up and which you will set up under the Gubernia Party Committees prove to be unsuccessful, don’t draw the conclusion that the whole enterprise is a failure.
We may not find a sufficient number of comrades in the gubernias capable of holding out from congress to congress.
If we don’t find them in the gubernias, we shall find staunch comrades with a knowledge of life in the centre.
I think we should not give up the idea of forming these bodies.
It may be said: Where is the guarantee that these bodies can exist? We are in a state of desperate civil war, where, generally speaking, there can be no question of any freedom of broad criticism and so forth.
We have other things to think of, we must strain every effort to end the war.
If the conditions of war were not what they are, the position would be different.
Under the present conditions we cannot provide for a good many things; and we say straight out that in order to settle this question in a practical manner we cannot rely on the C.
C.
, because it is swamped with work as it is.
I doubt whether you will find a single C.
C.
member—I judge from my own experience—who doesn’t feel over head and heels in debt as regards unfinished or skimped jobs.
I can imagine no more effective guarantee of this plan being carried out than the creation of this commission, of a group of comrades capable of concentrating wholly on this job with the assurance that it will be entirely independent, handling affairs which no single member of the C.
C.
, the Orgbureau, or the Politbureau is in a position to go into with any thoroughness.
We may have a practical grasp of things, seeingthat we are making some progress, that we have increased our grain collections from 60 to 260 million poods—but this proved insufficient to give us a Red Army that was not overexhausted, to give us workers who did not say, “What good has the Red Army done us, we are starving”, and to give us a leadership that was not utterly worn out and does not stand in need of help from the rank and file.
Nevertheless, we did make that progress, and that means that even in such a mass state of extreme fatigue the scale of this fatigue is beginning to diminish and we are entering a period when we can stop discussing the crust-of-bread question and pass on to weightier problems confronting us, which we all shall most certainly tackle.

the need for practical guarantees that the decisions of the Party, which is unanimous on the above-mentioned questions of principle, should not remain on paper.
The conference therefore directs the Central Committee imme-diately to resolve, carry out and furthermore propose to the next congress of the Party that it endorse the following: (1) the absolute obligatoriness of more frequent and wider meetings of Party members parallel with other meas-ures for developing activity among the Party membership; (2) literary organs to be set up, capable of carrying out a more systematic and wider criticism of the Party’s mistakes and generally of criticism within the Party (discussion leaflets, etc.
); (3) precise practical rules to be drawn up on measures for eliminating the existing inequality (in the conditions of life, size of salaries, and so forth) between specialists and executives, on the one hand, and the rank and file, on the other—an inequality that violates democracy, is a source of demoralisation within the Party and lowers the prestige of Communists; (4) it shall be found necessary to set up a Control Commis-sion parallel with the Central Committee consisting of the most experienced, unbiassed comrades having the longest Party training and capable of carrying out strict Party control.
The Control Commission elected by the congress of the Party should have the right to receive all kinds of complaints and examine them by arrangement with the Central Committee and if necessary by holding joint meetings with it or by submitting the question to the Party congress.

C.
P.
(B.
) OCTOBER 9, 1920 There is no need to speak of our internal position at this meeting, since all the comrades are sufficiently informed about this from our press and from work in the local areas.
Food collections are much bigger than they were last year so are fuel collections, and these are the foundations of our work.
We are worse off as regards supply, though.
Someof the big factories can now be started, and the temper of the workers in them cannot be as hopeless as it was when the factories were at a standstill.
Considering our economic situation, we can expect a change of heart.
I find it necessary to dwell on our external position, on the news of foreign .
policy.
Poland is in the grip of a tremendous crisis: economically, Poland has suffered worse destruction than we have; politically, things have reached a point when even an opportunist party like the P.
P.
S.
, 245 which has always conducted a vicious smear campaign against the Bolsheviks, protests against the brutal manner in which the government deals with the workers.
In the territory which we are ceding to them under the peace treaty Poland will be able to rule only by violence.
Among the worker and peasant masses of Poland there is a tremendous desire for peace.
In offering Poland peace and making tremendous concessions we shall make the political parties realise that we were right, make them realise that we did not want war with Poland.
By taking indemnities from us, Poland gains nothing.
She will not receive the money—France will take it.
Up till now this fact has been concealed in Poland, but the position is gradually being brought home to the workers, and we must see to it that it is brought home to them still more clearly.
Therefore it is necessary that we now conclude peace.
Besides, we shall win time and use it to strengthen our army.
On the Wrangel front the odds are in our favour, but at one time there was a grave danger to the Donets coal-field.
Wrangel is frustrating our plan of a general offensive by dealing separate blows in various directions.
An, at first glance insignificant, incident is characteristic politically.
Germany has allowed entry to Comrades Zinoviev and Bukharin to attend the forthcoming congress of the Independent Party in Germany.
Maybe this is sheer provocation, but, on the other hand, there is no doubt that Zinoviev’s arrival will speed up and deepen the split that had already started among the “Independents”.
Part of the breakaway “Independents” and up to a million members of the Communist Party of Germany will constitute an imposing revolutionary force.
What is more, it will serve as immense propaganda material for all Europe.
The crux of the matter is that the imperialist policy of France now stands revealed—of France, who has always upset our peace talks and is now putting spokes in our wheel again.
We must make use of every hour of the armistice to strengthen ourselves.
We must step up our supply activities, achieve quick successes on the Wrangel front, and then we can hope to tear the web of diplomatic intrigues against us.
The situation in the Far East is such that Japan is bound to withdraw, since she cannot possibly face a winter campaign.
This strengthens us.
At the present time there is an American multi-millionaire in Moscow, who is negotiating a concession on Kamchatka.
By granting this concession we shall aggravate relations between Japan and America.
In Turkestan and the Caucasus the situation is more complicated.
Recently the Turks have started to move on Armenia with the aim of seizing Batum, and afterwards, perhaps, Baku.
Obviously we must show the greatest caution in this matter.
So far we have no information about military complications.
However great the disagreements between France and Britain, we cannot work on them now so long as we are having defeat instead of victory.
Apparently, disagreements do exist.
Britain wants to trade with us and we are trying to achieve this.
As to how our army is equipped with weapons I cannot say in any detail.
There was a shortage of cartridges until recently, but the difficulties now have lessened.
The work is on a strong foundation, it only has to be intensified still more.
The Party organisations must help in this by working in the Party cells and through the trade unions.
As to what the chances are for victory, I cannot say just now, as the general feeling is hard to define at the moment.
The disappointment is too great; six weeks have already passed since we started to retreat and we are still retreating.
The thing is we are late with winter supplies; this has coincided with the defeat.
Without doubt, we must make use of every moment of the armistice to strengthen ourselves.
We cannot set the tone for agitation until we know something definite.
This meeting is already setting the tone.
According to Comrade Trotsky the question of Makhno has been very seriously discussed in military circles and it has been ascertained that we can expect nothing but a winning hand here.
The reason is that the elements grouped around Makhno have already had experience of Wrangel’s regime, and were not satisfied with what he could give them.
Our agreement with Makhno is hedged around with guarantees that he will not go against us.
We have the same picture here as with Denikin and Kolchak: as soon as they infringed upon the interests of the kulaks and the peasantry as a whole, the latter sided with us.
Unquestionably, the Poles, too, will use the armistice to strengthen themselves; maybe they will bring up munitions during that period, but that does not mean that we should not do the same.
So long as there is war, secret diplomacy must exist as a means of warfare.
We cannot renounce it.
An assessment of this diplomacy depends on a general assessment of the war.

Krzhizhanovsky.
257 We shall achieve effective implementation of the general plan of economic rehabilitation, which plan, without electrification, is nothing, and talk about “basic tasks” unrelated to this plan would not be serious.
For your preliminary information I enclose: 1) A copy of Krzhizhanovsky’s memorandum “Results of the Work of the State Commission for the Electrification of Russia”.
2) The booklet Basis of Northern Region Electrification Project, of which 3 copies for Trotsky, Rykov and Bukharin I can obtain tomorrow; the rest of the C.

members 5) Stunkel’s theses.
6) Krug’s theses.
7) List of GOELRO material (over 200 works).
The sum of these documents shows clearly that we are fully able (by timely correction of the theses and plan of Krzhizhanovsky’s report submitted on behalf of the C.

Lenin Chairman, Council of People’s Commissars First published in 1 9 5 9 in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI Printed from the typewritten copy SPEECH AT AN ANNIVERSARY PLENARY MEETING OF THE SOKOLNIKI DISTRICT SOVIET HELD JOINTLY WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FACTORY COMMITTEES AND INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENTS OF MOSCOW NOVEMBER 7, 1920 Comrade Lenin said in his speech that the victory we had won was the most important of all.
The international bourgeoisie had prevented us from engaging in productive labour, and all our energies in the course of three years had been engaged in war with them.
Now we must win a victory on the home front.
The bourgeoisie had diverted us from this work.
Comrade Lenin spoke about the questions to be dealt with at the coming congress of Soviets—thequestions of transport, agriculture, and so on.
He said that all enthusiasm and discipline were to be switched over to the work of peaceful construction and the participation of the rank and file in this job was to be secured.
In addition, red tape and officialism had to be combated.
Here, too, we had to win a victory, and there was only one way of doing that—by developing the consciousness and activity of the working masses themselves.
In conclusion Comrade Lenin expressed the conviction that we would win a victory over cold and hunger.

There is no question of a break with Britain, but merely that of pressure, for it is clear that Churchill, Curzon & Co.

C.
P.
(B.
) DECEMBER 6, 1920 Comrades, so many notes have been sent up that I cannot possibly answer them all.
On the other hand, most of the arguments have already been refuted in the debate, soI shall first comment on the booklet On Concessions.
275 I shall deal with this in greater detail.
Comrade Lomov’s one-and-a-half page preface deals with the subject all too briefly.
Then there is the decree itself of November 23, which sets forth the idea of the interests of world economy.
“The process of restoring the productive forces of Russia, and at the same time, of world economy as a whole, can be accelerated many times over by enlisting the co-operation of foreign state and municipal institutions, private enter-prises, joint-stock companies, co-operative societies and workers’ organisations of other countries in the extraction and processing of Russia’s natural resources.
” Of course, this is merely of propaganda value, but it is economically indisputable.
World economy has got to be restored.
Capitalism acts in such and such a way, and we have our own proposals, but so far world economy remains capitalist.
We wanted to attract foreigners.
Therefore the end of the decree lists these conditions: Point One: “The concessionaire is to receive reward in the form of a share of the produce stipulated in the agreement with the right of exporting it abroad.
” Without this they won’t go.
The share is not specified.
There will be a fight over this, we shall bargain and each of us will try to get the best of it.
Comrades here said we shall have to keep our eyes skinned, and that’s quite right.
Point Two: “In the event of special technical improve-ments being employed on a large scale the concessionaire will be granted trade priorities “such as the purchase of machinery, special agreements on large orders, etc.
).
” What do trade priorities mean? They mean we shall give this or that firm a priority agreement to the exclusion of another firm.
And if the firm takes concessions, we can buy them out, we may pay them extra on the price.
The main thing is that we shall be given machines.
I think this considera-tion is clear enough, and here again we shall maintain elements of propaganda.
Point Three: “Depending on the nature and conditions of the concession prolonged concession terms will be granted to ensure full compensation for the concessionaire’s risk and technical facilities invested in the concession.
” Here we have the duration of the concessions.
It is quite anindefinite period, and we couldn’t give Kamchatka on any other conditions, and Comrades Fedotov and Skvortsov are right about this being a special concession, which we are granting for important political reasons.
In granting them under such conditions we are willingly giving away what we do not need ourselves, and we shall be no worse off for the loss of it neither economically nor politically.
Point Four: “The Government of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
guaran-tees that the concessionaire’s property invested in the enterprise shall not be subject to nationalisation, confisca-tion or requisition.
” Haven’t you forgotten that we still have the law court? This is a well-considered phrase with which we were deeply concerned.
We wanted to mention it at first, then thought better of it and decided to say nothing.
Speech is silver but silence is gold.
There won’t be confiscation or requisition, but there remains the law court, and that court is ours, and if I am not mistaken it is composed of people elected by the Soviets.
Personally, I hold anything but a gloomy view about our court being a poor one.
So we shall make use of it.
Point Five: “The concessionaire shall have the right to hire workers and other employees for his enterprises in the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
with due observance of the code of labour laws or a special agreement guaranteeing workers definite con-ditions of work that protect their lives and health.
” There is nothing cautious here.
If the workers go on strike and that strike is a reasonable one, we shall then be able secretly to support the strikers.
What threat do the capitalists use? “We’ll throw you out into the street and you will starve.
” But here they may find themselves getting a ration from somewhere or other, it all depends on us.
We can and shall give it to them.
And if the strike is a silly one, unreasonable, we’ll have them up on the Soviet carpet and tell them off good and proper.
It speaks here of a special agreement, but it is worded very carefully.
By way of exception, however, it will have to be applied to Kamchatka, as we are not in a position to set up any Soviet bodies there.
This is where Vanderlip was to demand a special agreement.
We haven’t even started yet to apply our own laws to Kamchatka.
Point Six: “The Government of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
guarantees the concessionaire against any unilateral change in theterms of the concession agreement by any order or decree of the Government.
” We undertake not to change the terms of the agreement unilaterally, otherwise no one will sign it.
This means there must be some go-betweens.
Who? The neutral states are all capitalist states.
Workers’ organisa-tions? We may have to invite Menshevik workers’ organi-sations.
In Western Europe they are in a majority.
Maybe the Mensheviks will decide in turn—even number for the Bolsheviks, odd number for the capitalists.
But if we don’t come to terms, the agreement may be broken.
That danger remains, but if it is a property agreement there is no harm in that.
According to the basic principles of international law this is a private agreement, and you can break it, paying compensation, of course.
If you broke it you’ve got to pay.
There have been cases in the practice of international law when the ship of another country has been sunk by mistake during the war.
It was taken for an enemy ship, but proved to be a neutral vessel.
What is to be done? Pay up.
The same here, as a last resort you buy yourself off.
There still remains withdrawal from the war, though.
War, of course, in the final analysis, is the ultimate argument.
Of course, so long as there are capitalists in the world you must be prepared for war, once you have a socialist state.
Further, we here are worrying now, but no one has taken a concession yet.
When certain comrades say, “Ah well, this is the end, they’ll all come crowding in now,” I repeat, it’s possible that no one will care to take it at all.
Section One: “Timber concessions in Western Siberia.
” The Northern Sea Passage is open for shipping, but we have no merchant fleet.
A comrade says representatives have arrived, wishing to receive 6000 dessiatines in checkered order.
The northern booklet says that if we take the extra electric stations of Petrograd we could use them for taking timber out of the northern districts and develop a production that would give us foreign currency to the value of five hundred thousand gold rubles a year.
And total electrifica-tion, according to the estimate of the State Commission, will cost over a thousand million.
It is a question whether we shall be able to do it.
Concessions, however, will make this task easier.
You don’t go about offering concessions because you find life good, and when that life is a hungryone, when you have to wangle things so as to give the people a respite, you have to argue differently.
Section Three: “Mining concessions in Siberia.
” Siberia is fabulously rich in copper.
Copper has an extremely high value in world economy and is one of the principal metals used in electrification.
We are offering a concession but do not know who will take it.
America or the Germans.
America will think that if she doesn’t take it, Germany will.
When we carry through electrification we shall be a hundred times stronger economically.
We shall then speak a different language.
We shall speak about redemption.
They know that the socialist society is not only quick at creating a Red Army, but can be quick in other things as well.
Further, separate concessions.
Three million dessiatines in the European part of Russia alone.
Of these, over 800,000 dessiatines in the former Don Cossack Region.
There are no state farms or livestock.
Whole stanitsas along the river Ural are ruined, splendid virgin lands are lying idle.
Even if we give away three quarters of the wheat crop raised there, we shall receive one quarter.
We must strengthen our transport and we can stipulate that tractors be delivered cheaper.
If we cannot put three million dessiatines of magnificent land to the plough, which will yield us 100 poods of wheat per dessiatine—then what sort of farming is it? What sort of policy is it? The Italians are interested in this, and Italy is on the eve of a revolution.
In Italy the main argument against a revolution is “We won’t be able to feed ourselves, the capitalist powers won’t give us any food”.
But the socialist power says, “I have three million dessiatines of land, I have oil and benzine”.
You must realise that you can agitate on various planes about capitalism being a dead thing, and that it must be strangled.
We have seen a good deal.
The European is living in the same conditions as the Russian did when he went towards revolution from the agonies of war.
With them the war is over, they are living by robbing other peoples.
All the more weight does this argument carry.
They are unable to restore their economy, and we offer them to start restoring it now.
We have here combined a political argument and socialist agitation, butin a different form.
You must learn to carry on agitation, otherwise your economic plans will come to nothing.
And we are not only agitators, we are a Socialist Republic standing up to all the capitalist states in the world.
You can’t run your economy, but we can.
There is a possibility of comparison here.

The post of Assistant People’s Commissar to be instituted at the Commissariat for Education with all administrative functions concentrated in his hands.
3.
General reorganisation of the Commissariat for Educa-tion is considered essential, but it should be more thoroughly prepared, particularly it should be discussed at a number of meetings in connection with the Congress of Soviets.
Exact distribution of functions between the central and local bodies of the Commissariat for Education to be dis-cussed and settled there.
4.
It is considered necessary in principle to merge the secondary schools (or their higher forms) with technical vocational training under two indispensable conditions: 1) that general education subjects and communism in the technical vocational schools be extended; 2) that practical steps be taken immediately to pass over to polytechnical education, for which purpose use is to be made of every available electric station and suitable factory.
The implementation of this reform is to be deferred pending the general reorganisation.

) GROUP AT THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECEMBER 21 Comrades, I have received quite a few notes and shall briefly answer those to which no replies have yet been given.
But first let me read to you a note of an informative nature, which I think is characteristic: At the Arzamas uyezd congress, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, a non-Party peasant declared the following concerning concessions, which we communicate to you as a characteristic sign: “Comrades, we are dele-gating you to the All-Russia Congress and declare that we, peasants, are prepared to endure hunger and cold and do our duty for another three years but don’t sell Mother-Russia in the form of concessions!” I think it would be very useful to quote this note in the official report to the Congress, * and it ought to be done because it shows a side of the question which the capitalists overlook, and in connection with which we have no need whatever to conceal the fact that there is a danger here, and we have to be on our guard against it.
I have already mentioned that these reminders sharpen the attention of the workers and peasants.
The fact that such reminders are coming from the midst of the illiterate peasantry is of special importance, as it stresses a task which is of excep-* See Vol.

tional importance at the present time—I mean about your having to examine the bills tabled in the Council of People’s Commissars for rendering assistance to peasant farming.
We must learn to convince the non-Party peasants, win them over to our side and make them self-dependent.
A note like this shows that we have every chance of achieving tremendous success here, and we shall achieve it.
Here is another note: Won’t the capitalist concessionaires set the proletarian masses against the Soviet government? seeing that the economic crisis and chaos we are living through make it impossible for us to satisfy the needs of the workers the way the capitalists can? I have said already that in the advanced countries, in most of them, the workers are better provided for than ours, yet the Russian workers in all the advanced countries are all eagerness to come to Soviet Russia, although they are well aware of the hardships the workers have to bear.
Won’t the Russian Ryabushinskys and the rest of the pack put in an appearance together with the English and American capitalists? This has a bearing on the note which asks whether the concessionaires will be exterritorial.
Of course not, we shall never grant them exterritoriality.
This is granted only to ambassadors, and even then on definite conditions.
If Ryabushinsky banks on hiding himself from the proper authorities, I think he is mistaken.
Next, comrades, I want to tell you that Comrade Lezhava reports: “Vanderlip has presented a mandate from about a dozen big syndicates.
This has been verified by our special authorities here.
It has already been corroborated by Krasin in London, who has checked up on the seriousness of the groups for whom Vanderlip is acting.
” For the benefit of those comrades who ask why the agree-ment has not been published, I repeat that its publication is not to our advantage, because the capitalists, who are fighting among themselves, think there are far worse things in that agreement.
The hullabaloo about it in the press bears this out.
Let them go on believing it, we have no intention whatever of disillusioning them.
Those who wish to famil-iarise themselves with this agreement have every possibil-ity of doing so.
Besides, I mentioned that the agreementwill come into force after the new president of the United States of America has been sworn in.
Our Party congress will be held in February.
281 Consequently, the Party will have every opportunity of controlling and deciding things.
Please explain, if you can, for how long Kamchatka has been let (or is proposed to be let) and is there an economic, apart from a polit-ical, advantage in this for the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
and in what form? Kamchatka has not been let and cannot be let until March.
The economic gain is that according to the draft agreement they are obliged to give us a share of the mineral wealth which they will extract.
In granting concessions do we not thereby admit the durability of the capitalist states and do we not consider our thesis concerning the earliness of a world revolution to be incorrect? Bukharin has replied to this.
It is not a question of our admitting their durability; the point is that gigantic forces are driving them to the brink.
Our existence and speedy release from the critical situation and famine are a gigantic force and a factor of revolution more powerful than those farthings—a mere crumb from the point of view of world economy—which they will get from us.
An extra hundred or thousand machines and locomotives are of tremendous importance to us, for it will mean that transport repairs, which Trotsky planned over a period of four and a half years and reduced to three and a half, will be reduced by another year.
Reducing the economic chaos and famine by a year is of colossal importance to us.
What if Japan, to prevent us letting Kamchatka to America, goes and occupies it with her troops and declares it her own? As a matter of fact she is in possession of Kamchatka right now, and if she could she would do it, but she can’t because she is afraid of America.
Where will the capitalist get his labour force? Will he bring it with him? Hardly.
If he is going to employ Russian workers, not only will these be under the thumb of the capitalist, but it will upset our labour market, and this, in turn, will upset our integrated economic plan.
I can’t see how our economic plan will be upset by our workers going there to work.
They won’t be able to go thereapart from the trade unions, apart from our economic organ-isations and our Party.
The workers at the advanced capi-talist enterprises will train our workers in the best methods of production.
In submitting to capitalist conditions of work, our workers will subordinate them to our code of labour laws or to special restrictive agreements, and will not hesitate to quit if the conditions are bad, If the condi-tions are unfavourable, the workers will quit.
Some comrades are afraid that the conditions will be good, others, that they will be bad.
We shall look out, just like our workers and peasants, and take proper measures.
In granting concessions, when the concessionaires start working, will the activities of the R.
C.
P.
in organising communist cells among those employed on the concession territory be open or only illegal? Here is a wrong idea of concessions and concessionaires.
The concessionaire is not an authority.
He does not get any territory other than that to be used for economic ex-ploitation.
All government bodies and all courts of law remain only in the hands of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
Should unemployment in America force a revolution, won’t our concessions be helping America to cope with this crisis, that is, hold up the revolution.
That argument has been disproved by Comrade Bukharin.
If the international bourgeoisie gets to know of the Soviet govern-ment’s tactics in concessions, what will the position of the Soviet government be? Won’t this be bad for us? On the contrary, everyone in Europe has heard about the concessions, and the hullabaloo about it there only goes to show that the bourgeoisie is worried.
They are anxious not to be late.
All those capitalists who do not want to risk having dealings with Russia are now beginning to realise that they are lagging behind while the more enterprising people are getting in.
And we are taking advantage of the contradictions among the capitalists.
Are there any plans or projects for concessions on large industrial enterprises in Moscow and in the centre generally? There is talk about three such concessions in Moscow, Yaroslavl and Lubertsi.
I know nothing about such concessions.
There is an American factory in Lubertsi which has not been nationalisedand never was, but there is no concession there.
The only concession in the centre, which the S.
E.
C.
comrades have spoken of as being possible, is a concession to the German chemists for developing dye works and letting one factory to them.
In the Council of People’s Commissars all were agreed it was possible, but this talk has had no practical consequences.
Germany is so far ahead of our country that during the imperialist war even the advanced countries found them-selves in difficulties when the German chemical industry stopped supplying them.
To get our chemical industry going we must be prepared to pay the German chemists well.
The best way to learn is to grant the Germans a con-cession on one of our factories.
No schools or lectures will help as much as practical work at a factory, where the workers can be trained in six months and then made to build another factory like it next door.
To fear that the Germans of a single factory will do something to us, con-sidering their international situation, is ridiculous.
There were no differences of opinion in the C.
P.
C.
In point of principle it is acceptable.
Unfortunately, this question has not had practical results.
I must stress the fact that we talk a great deal about concessions, but so far we have not succeeded in granting a single one.
We shall consider it a great success if we manage to grant at least one, and you will see the concrete conditions of the concession.
Further.
What countries can be granted concessions? Can we give a conces-sion to Poland? We believe they can be granted to all countries, Poland included.
Couldn’t the capitalists use the concessions to avert crises at home and thus stave off a social revolution? If the capitalists could avert crises at home, then capital-ism would be everlasting.
They are decidedly blind pawns in the general mechanism—the imperialist war has shown that.
Every month proves that the crisis of capitalism is deepening, disintegration throughout the world is spreading farther and farther, and Russia is the only country wherean upswing towards a durable and serious improvement has started.
To sow dissension among the workers the concessionaires may place their workers in better conditions.
This won’t increase dissension among our people, we have grown much stronger.
Will trade union groups be organised on the concessionaire’s territory? The concessionaires get economic exploitation, authorities and laws remain Soviet ones.
the Can you outline the conditions guaranteeing us against the danger of the Soviet state system being distorted and a capitalist set-up being introduced? These conditions are the laws of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
If a contracting party breaks them we have the right to cancel the agreement.
What is the gist of the tentative draft agreement with the American imperialists covering a concession on Kamchatka? I said that the term of the concession is 50-60 years.
We get a share of the produce, they the right to set up a military and naval base at the inlet near which there is an oil deposit.
You say that granting concessions to the capitalists of oppressed countries like Germany is more important than for other countries.
But if the capitalists of oppressed countries use the concessions to improve their country’s economic position, don’t you think this will stave off the revolution in that country? The international situation as regards revolution revolves around Soviet Russia’s struggle against the rest of the world, the capitalist countries.
To strengthen Soviet Russia and make her invincible—that is what matters most as far as the struggle of the oppressed and colonial countries is concerned.
What role in concessions does Turkestan cotton play? So far there is no question of granting a concession on Turkestan cotton.
This question was not discussed.
Will concessions be granted for the rehabilitation of industrial enterprises and for taking over railways?Such exigencies are ruled out.
The railways are a single integrated enterprise.
Has there been any question of concessions on slaughter-houses? Not that I have heard of.
The protests against concessions in the local areas stand clearly revealed, not as healthy sentiments at all, but as patriotic feeling among a strong petty-bourgeois section of the countryside and among the urban middle classes.
The patriotism of a person who is prepared to go hungry for three years rather than surrender Russia to foreigners is genuine patriotism, without which we could not hold out for three years.
Without this patriotism we would not have succeeded in defending the Soviet Republic, in doing away with private property and now getting as much as 300 million poods by means of the food surplus-appropria-tion system.
This is the finest revolutionary patriotism.
As for the kulaks being prepared to go hungry for three years to keep out the foreign capitalists, from whom they have something to gain—that is untrue.
It is not the kulaks who are concerned, it is the non-Party middle peasant.
Isn’t there a risk that in view of a possible war between America and Japan there is a likelihood of a serious attack on Soviet Russia by Japan? What shall we do then? Shall we fight off Japan in alliance with imperialist America, using her assistance as a real force? Of course we shall—we have often said that an alliance with one imperialist state against another to consolidate the socialist republic is not objectionable in point of princi-ple.
An attack by Japan on Soviet Russia is much more difficult now than it was a year ago.
Please explain the Allies’ policy towards Turkey and our relation-ships.
It is rather awkward, of course, to deal openly with this question in an official speech, as relations here are extremely confused.
Everything here depends on the intri-cate play of relations in bourgeois Georgia, which is on the verge of catastrophe.
The comrades who are interested in this will, I am sure, derive great benefit from the report by Comrade Meshcheryakov, Editor of Pravda, who has returned from Georgia, where he spent several weeks, if notmonths, and has collected highly interesting material on this Menshevik realm.
Georgia is on the verge of disaster.
The Turkish attack was planned against us.
The Allies were making a pitfall for us, but fell into it themselves, because we have received Soviet Armenia.
The men at the top in Turkey are Cadets, Octobrists, Nationalists, who are prepared to sell us to the Allies.
But that is an extremely difficult thing to do, because feeling among the Turkish people against the savage oppression by the Allies is running very high, and sympathy towards Soviet Russia is growing in proportion as we help the inde-pendent Azerbaijan Republic to carry out proper liberation of the Moslem peasants, who have driven out the landowners, but are afraid to take the land, and will shortly stop being afraid; when they do take the land the Turkish landowner won’t last long.
We personally have been and will be peaceful in the extreme in the Caucasus, and for the information of our Caucasian comrades, we shall be very careful to avoid anything that may involve us in war.
Our peaceful policy so far has been so felicitous, that the Allies are getting nervous, have started taking decisive steps against us? but are only getting them against themselves.
What is going to happen next to Georgia? Even the Mohammedan Allah doesn’t know that, but if we show self-restraint we have something to gain without running any risk.
We are asked whether there were any other concession objects besides Kamchatka.
There have been no other concessions with Vanderlip.
Regarding press hand-outs.
We can’t do that, first because the printing-works are busy, and secondly so as not to make this material available to people abroad, where there is a desire to torpedo this undertaking of ours.
So far we haven’t got a single concession, a single agreement, and we must first get an agreement before speaking about dangers.
We have nothing so far and are acting semi-legally.
How will things stand with concessions and with works and build-ings erected by concessionaires in the event of a) their violating the laws of the R.
S.

b) war breaking out with a country of which the concessionaire is a subject, and c) with others?In the event of an agreement being violated the concession-aire will be prosecuted under the laws of the R.

in accordance with military procedure.
The Russian bourgeoisie, who have escaped abroad, will be able to take part in the exploitation of concessions with their capital.
Won’t this lead to the old bosses coming back under the guise of foreign capital? If an old boss takes a ride through the northern forests of European Russia under the guise of foreign capital we have nothing to fear.
You will find many an old boss in the centre of Moscow.
We have a thousand times less reason to fear a situation in which we shall have a list of all visiting foreigners, than those bosses who are operating at our enter-prises and who, unfortunately, have not been registered yet.
You have pointed out and underlined the political significance of concessions.
That is understandable.
But what the provinces are most worried about is this: with concessions there will be trade rela-tions.
What threats and dangers to the Republic does this imply in the sense of disintegration and the blowing up of the Soviet system from within (perhaps increased profiteering, etc.
) and what precautions can we take against it? I have already spoken about that.
We had a tremendous threat of profiteering in the shape of Sukharevka, 282 with which we waged a constant struggle.
We understand, of course, that with the abolition of Sukharevka profiteering still remains, it remains wherever there is a small proprietor, and we have tens of millions of such proprietors.
That is where the real danger lies, and not in big capital, which will be hedged around on all sides with special supervisions.
It should not be forgotten that we shall have an agreement which we can always cancel at the risk—our greatest danger—of having to pay damages.
What is the position with regard to tsarist debts? Will the Allies agree to any transactions unless these debts are paid? England already agrees not to demand the debts from us, since we have proposed the draft of a trade agreement to them.
Under that draft trade deals are now starting and under it we are not obliged to repay debts.
I say, England agrees, but France does not.
And so we tell France that inprinciple we do not refuse.
The exact amounts of payments will be discussed at a conference, at which we intend to say: you, too, are responsible for the losses you have caused us by your intervention.
An ad hoc commission is working on this question, and an initial estimate puts the figure at ten thousand million in gold.

C.
P.
(B.
) GROUP AT THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DURING THE DEBATE ON THE REPORT OF THE ALL-RUSSIA CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS CONCERNING HOME AND FOREIGN POLICIES DECEMBER 22 Comrades, allow me to begin by touching on certain remarks made by speakers and answering notes, at least the more important ones.
From Comrade Korzinov’s criticism I have picked out the idea concerning engineers and agron-omists.
We must push forward with the training of engi-neers and agronomists from among the workers and peasants.
This is beyond all question, and the Soviet government is taking steps in this direction, but we cannot count on very quick results; it may not take as long as electrification, but it will take at least several years; so it is wrong of Comrade Korzinov to suggest that all other matters be set aside until we have our own agronomists.
Right now we have got to find and get the best agronomists, call them to our meetings, demand from them an account and thus single out the industrious and educated men from the rest.
Comrade Korzinov has landed in the opposition for opposition’s sake when he says that the decree on concessions should have been published earlier.
But our work at the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labour and Defence is such that we have to react at once, and theposition with us is such that, given no differences of opinion in the C.
C.
and C.
P.
C.
, decisions are taken at once.
If the decree on concessions is wrong, 283 then we should propose its repeal, because the chief concession with Vanderlip will not become a formal agreement until next March.
At the time we published this decree our main purpose was, and still remains, to conclude a trade agreement as quickly as possible and offer the bait of concessions to the capitalists.
I dealt with this political aspect of the case in my report to the R.
C.
P.
group and heard no objections at the time.
I was therefore surprised when Comrade Ignatov, bent on being opposition-minded, said that we had slipped up on Vanderlip, that we hadn’t found out who he was.
I read the statement by the Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade that all inquiries concerning the group Vanderlip represented had been made, had been confirmed abroad and remained unrefuted.
Vanderlip himself had pointed out that no agreement could be concluded until after the presidential elections, when the Republican candi-date would take office, since such an agreement would have to be sanctioned by the American Government.
This is an agreement under which the American Govern-ment is to receive a naval base.
Consequently, even if this Washington Vanderlip, about whom Comrade Ryazanov went into such irrelevant details—as often happens with him—even if he did represent nobody and was just a swindler and the proposed agreement was to provide for the Govern-ment of the United States receiving a naval base aimed against Japan, there could be no question of our being swindled, as the President of the United States would really be a mem-ber of the Republican Party.
After Vanderlip we shall be in a position to form a conclusive opinion about this trade agreement.
Ignatov’s entire criticism falls to the ground; he simply did not pay attention to what was said at our meeting.
Comrade Korzinov said that in the matter of Poland we should have given warning earlier.
We have here an extremely difficult situation, and there was a moment when our troops were on the move and the Central Committee had reason to believe that despite the complicated situation we could achieve much by launching an offensive.
At such a time when, after Curzon’s Note of July 11, 284 we had to give a reply within a few days, how could we be expected to call Party meetings to discuss the matter? Besides, every comrade knows that if we could have passed over to an offensive war at the right moment we would have done so without hesitation.
And there would never have been any opposition to it anywhere.
What we did see was an opposition in reverse, when we were accused of not pursuing a sufficiently active foreign policy.
That there have been mistakes here, there is no doubt, but neither is there any doubt that arguing about them would be a sheer waste of time, as we have other things to think of besides our old activities.
When time has receded, when all the documents and material will have been collected, we shall be able to fully appreciate our mistake.
Therefore, I see nothing, absolutely nothing, in Comrade Korzinov’s speech other than a desire to seek opposition.
At another time, when we are in more favourable conditions, we shall make the same use of our successes.
And so long as the Party does not forbid it, we shall always assume the offensive.
I don’t think that the Party or any of its members will propose a reverse policy at any meeting.
In regard to Comrade Gusev’s remark, I must say that I made a mistake in introducing polemics in an official report, and therefore I have already suggested that this part of the report be deleted from the official text and greet-ings to Soviet Armenia added—through an unforgivable oversight on my part this was omitted in the report.
Comrade Gusev is wrong in saying that I boasted of my modesty—the point is that in passing over to a more serious practical integration of the economic commissariats and the implementation of a single economic plan, the thing we had to be afraid of was project-mongering.
Comrade Gusev says that I did not criticise his booklet 285 as a whole.
But that is the central point: Comrade Trotsky and Comrade Rykov are invited to drop the departments and join the Council of Defence, which, not being a depart-mental body, will set up a new apparatus of its own I cannot understand how, after three years of Soviet rule, one can raise and support such a question here.
I am at a loss for words to express my perplexity.
It is so ill-advised, itmeans knocking down the department in one place and setting it up in another.
It means failure to understand what our apparatus is.
I don’t know whether Comrade Popov has managed to print the leaflet he gave me.
It contains an extract from the 1920 census results.
You know that this census has been satisfactorily carried out and has yielded a mass of valuable information concerning the number of Soviet office employees in Moscow.
We took a similar census before this in 1919, but now we have a fuller one.
It shows that we have no less than 230,000 office employees, of which 30,000, or even more, are in the most important commissariats, and 70,000 in the Moscow Soviet.
286 Try to imagine these figures, ponder over them, and then you will say to yourself—well, if you take an influential man, one who enjoys the greatest authority and has created a certain style of work in his department, take him out of that department and put him in charge of several united departments, you can expect nothing but chaos.
Is that the way to fight bureaucratism? It is simply a frivolous attitude towards the work, absolutely unrealistic.
I understand what a serious thing bureaucratism is, but no provision for its abolition is made in the Party Programme.
It is not a problem for a congress, it is a problem for a whole epoch, and you have a special report devoted to this question.
Does anyone really believe that by a mere stroke of the pen, by taking comrades, who have created the best form of organisation in one or another of the most important departments, and transferring them to the Council of Labour and Defence, you will be getting a new department with indefinite powers that will not perform economically unifying functions.
When the practical question arose in the Council of Labour and Defence as to what was econom-ic and what was not, not only the Foreign Trade Commis-sariat, but the Finance Commissariat as well claimed that it was an economic commissariat.
And can you conduct any economic work without the Commissariat for Public Health.
Of course, when we shall have made big progress in economic reconstruction the relation of economic commis-sariats to non-economic ones may become different after we have achieved important successes in the work of changing our economic foundations.
At present we have nothing ofthe kind.
Therefore, to treat the departmental question as lightly as Gusev does—in other parts of the booklet, by the way, he repeats some of the excellent ideas expressed in his previous booklet 287—is absolutely wrong.
I shall say nothing about Ryazanov’s speech, which has been sufficiently refuted by Kamenev.
I shall merely mention that both Ryazanov and Gusev, who has followed his bad example, have been talking about having heard, perhaps from me in the Council of People’s Commissars, that I wanted to, one said drown myself, the other said shoot myself.
If comrades are going to take a man at his angry word, uttered when he is very tired, and make him speak about it before an audience of a thousand, I don’t think these people can expect their speeches to be taken seriously.
(Applause.
) It’s quite possible that we have a lot of vermicelli affairs in the Council of People’s Commissars—that’s true.
If Maximovsky has made this an object on which to display his oppositionist bent and made a special point of it, I must say there is not and cannot be any government institution which does not have to deal with vermicelli affairs.
You omitted to mention that the C.
C.
dealt with questions involv-ing policy.
So long as the ruling Party governs, so long as this Party has to decide all questions concerned with various appointments, you will not allow important state appointments to be made by anyone but the ruling party.
When all is said and done, the question of who is to make this or that policy is of secondary importance.
Hasn’t the C.
C.
vermicelli affairs? Plenty of them.
Aren’t there agendas, on completing which and running through a dozen items of business, you would not only say you’d be glad to drown yourself, but something worse still.
I repeat, to catch me at this sort of statement is not very difficult, but to come out here and make it an object for an oppositionist stand and speak against vermicellism is frivolous.
If, in a body which in general establishes only principles, we attempted to set up a separate body to deal with petty, practical, vermicelli affairs, we would only make things worse.
Because we would be tearing generalisation away from the facts of life, and such a break would be sheer day-dreaming and frivolity.
Questions in the Central Committeecannot be divided into questions of principle and trivial questions, because in every trifle a principle may be involved.
It is not a question of Ivan or Sidor.
It is not a question of putting Sidor in Ivan’s place or vice versa.
What if they refuse? What if this Ivan and Sidor are both people’s commissars—what’s to be done then? The C.
C.
has a Secretar-iat, an Orgbureau, a Politbureau, finally, plenums of the Central Committee are held, and very often questions come before the Central Committee Plenum that are as trivial and tedious as anything, and some that you sit over for several hours until you feel like drowning yourself.
But to draw a line between trivial questions and questions of principle is to undermine the very foundation of democratic centralism.
At the same time it cannot be said that the Central Committee dumps its vermicelli onto other insti-tutions.
So far we have not been able to alter the Constitution and have been working autonomously.
The fact that on some questions we have arrived at an agreement and on others there have been debates is only natural and inevitable, considering the apparatus we have.
The fact that the C.
C.
is becoming an organ of control, and that in the general distribution of work it has fallen to Comrade Kalinin to supervise agitation and verification, and that he is required to give his personal impressions obtained during his trips and at work—this gives no grounds for shouting about the Council of People’s Commissars referring all questions to the C.
C and vice versa.
It means introducing further confu-sion and turmoil while things remain essentially unchanged.
The higher bodies are needed for the purpose of control and for turning down certain questions.
People here have spoken and complained about the Presid-ium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee being swamped with business, and though it is our highest body, it is swamped with purely vermicelli affairs.
But I would ask all those present here, how many of you have read a dozen reports of our proceedings? Who has read them from begin-ning to end? Probably no one, because they are dull, you can’t wade through them.
I must say that every member of our Party and every citizen of the Republic has a right to bring any question, any circumstance, however trivial, before the All-Russia Central Executive Committee.
Thisquestion will go through the whole ladder, through the bureau, etc.
till it gets to the C.
E.
C.
Presidium, where it will be examined.
And so it will be until the complete communist re-education of the working people, which will come within several decades after electrification has been finally completed.
In this respect we are not afraid of changes.
I shall now deal with some of the notes.
Comrade Minkin writes: Did Comrade Shlyapnikov inform the Council of People’s Com-missars of the disgraceful goings on at the Commissariat for Foreign Trade, or was this being kept for announcement at the Congress? If he did make such a statement, what has been done to eliminate them? To answer this question I consulted Comrade Serebryakov who is better informed than I am.
He was appointed by the Central Committee to the commission, the other members of which were Dzerzhinsky, Krestinsky and Lezhava, set up to take steps towards improving the relations between the Commissariat for Foreign Trade and the Commissariat for Internal Affairs, since our representatives abroad had information that these relations were anything but satis-factory.
At my request Serebryakov gives the following answer to the note of delegate Minkin: “Comrade Minkin states.
.
.
” (reads).
After this commission a subcommission was set up.
It is very easy to play at opposition, since there are disgraceful goings on with us in every commissariat, and the infelicitous mention of guarantees and 30,000 employees in the commis-sariat’s technical publishing house is very characteristic in the sense that you can always find scandalously disgraceful things here.
You will find the same thing in any division of the Red Army.
Nevertheless our Red Army has been winning victories all the time.
The thing is to apply in good time to the institution that has to remedy matters, and not talk about it here, where we cannot collect accurate information about what Comrade Ryazanov has heard of this or that person and has not checked it or discovered the true facts.
Is that democratic centralism? It is not at all democratic, and not at all centralism, but disorder and the introduction of chaos.
Complaints should be lodged with Party bodies.
If thatbody does not fulfil its duty it should be made to give a strict account of itself.
Among the notes that have been sent up there is the question of reducing the army.
On this subject Comrade Trotsky will make a special statement, and you will decide whether this question should be dealt with today or at the next special meeting of the R.
C.
P.
group.
I can tell you that after an ad hoc commission on demobilisation headed by Trotsky and Dzerzhinsky was set up, the C.
C.
decided to start demobilisation, and this is now going on.
It is being dealt with by the military department, and you will receive an exact report.
Is the Council of Labour and Defence regarded as an interim body called upon to unite the economic commissariats and then to be abolished, or is it the basis of a future integrated economic plan? Also, on what apparatus does the Council rely locally? This question has not been settled, and we believe that to raise it now would be a waste of time.
The order of the day now is a check-up of the organisation of the commis-sariats.
The Council of People’s Commissars has set up an organisational body which is to revise the apparatus of the People’s Commissariats with a view to the tasks confronting them, and in this connection, to examine the question of staffs.
To busy ourselves at the present time with setting up another apparatus in place of the Council of Labour and Defence is impossible until the question of electrification is settled.
Various material on electrification will soon be handed out to you, and the Council of Labour and Defence will have to reckon with what the verification of this mate-rial and the reports will have to say.
We now have an organ that we need, and, good or bad, we have in any case been working with it and coping with the tasks confronting us.
We have no intention of embarking on reforms until we have practically tested how the integrated economic plan will be carried out.
This is definitely a case of look before you leap.
Who is going to conclude concession contracts in the Far East we or the buffer state, in either case—why? This, comrades, is a delicate question.
Buffer state 288 — it is such an embarrassing definition when we are asked:You or the buffer? On the one hand we have the buffer, on the other, the corresponding Party Bureau of the R.
C.
P.
The buffer’s a buffer, it’s to enable us to win time and then beat the Japanese.
I don’t know whom Kamchatka belongs to.
Actually the Japanese are in possession, and they do not relish the idea of our giving it away to the Americans.
We are consulted, our directives are complied with, and nobody has protested against our negotiations with Vanderlip, no single group of Party comrades has considered the question important enough to demand its being discussed at the plenum of the Central Executive Committee and examined in the Control Commission.
This is the right of every Party member, and no one has used this right.
The person who has learned the facts which led to the postponement of an agreement till March will not try to make use of this right.
What is your view of the trade unions at the present moment in connection with the concessions? Is it true that you stand for the organisation of a trade union of peasants? I must say that the Party’s Programme mentions the necessity of seeking new forms of trade unions that would unite the poor sections of the peasantry.
289 This task has been posed in the Party’s Programme and I have often pointed out that although we are not in a position at present to solve this problem, we must not give it up.
We must not confine ourselves to the work of Vserabotzem, 290 which is so weak, and which cannot give us outstanding workers.
So long as we have a levelling process taking place among the peasantry, a levelling and unification of the working peasants, the non-kulak section of the peasantry, this problem cannot be removed from the order of the day of socialist construction.
To strengthen the work of the trade unions we must extend them not only to the rural proletariat, but to all the working peasantry.
How this is to be done we do not know yet.
We have set this task in the Party’s Programme, we shall return to it many times and get it settled in a practical manner from different aspects.
That is all I can say now on this question.
With the granting of concessions, the trade unions, natu-rally, will have important tasks imposed upon them—thoseof checking, supervising, and maintaining contact with the workers who will be employed in these concessions.
How this task will be handled in practice, I cannot say at the moment.
To raise this question at the present time would be inadvisable, as the trade unions have more important tasks facing them.
In our fight against bureaucratism we certainly need the help of the trade unions.
We must rely on them.
This is basically provided for in the Party’s Programme.
291 This shows what a long struggle is needed and what systematic work faces us.
When we shall have data that in such-and-such a workmen’s settlement the business of supervision is organised in such-and-such a way and definite results have been achieved, while in such-and-such a block, uyezd, etc.
things are different—then we shall be able to weigh things, get them moving, and there will not only be talk about the “agitpotato” but we shall be in a position to check what steps have been taken in practice and on this ground apply practical measures that have already yielded results.

P.
C.
“ON MEASURES TO CONSOLIDATE AND DEVELOP PEASANT FARMING” DELIVERED TO THE R.
C.
P.
GROUP OF THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECEMBER 27 Comrades, the Central Committee today has examined the decision adopted by the group concerning the deletion of the words “individual householders” from the point of the resolution on agriculture which deals with improvement and premiums.
The C.
C.
has passed the following resolution and authorised me to defend it.
292 (Reads.
) There, comrades, you have the text of the C.
C.
’s decision.
Allow me now togive the reasons why we simply could not agree with the group’s decision.
We had no doubts, and this was parti-cularly stressed at the C.
C.
meeting, that the principal reasons the group was guided by in its decision to reject the idea of premiums for individual householders were the fear that we would give premiums to the kulak, and the desire to give priority to the village commune, the volost, the collective unit—to common labour, not the individual.
With this we are in perfect agreement.
We con-sider, however, that it would be wrong to let ourselves reject altogether the idea of premiums for individual farmers for reasons, which in themselves are quite correct, fundamen-tally indisputable to any Marxist and especially valuable from the point of view of the peasantry.
Allow me to give you some information from the history of the origin of this bill.
I have been following its progress through the Council of People’s Commissars fairly closely and must say that in the first draft, tabled by the Food Commissariat, the main accent, generally speaking, was on the hardworking farmer.
The gist of Comrade Sereda’s proposals was that it would be wrong to stake on the hard-working farmer, and that we should stake on the village commune, the collective body.
The Council’s attitude on this question—at least, mine—was that we had to weigh all the pros and cons and consult the local people.
Indeed, it seemed wrong to me to reject premiums for individual farmers, but that the village commune had to be given priority—this might be all right if the local people with practical experience confirmed that it could and should be done.
From this conflict of two points of view there emerged the formulation that was adopted for the bill of the Council of People’s Commissars, namely, that both be retained and a ratio established between the two kinds of premiums.
The details, as defined in the Council, were to be covered by instructions.
In fact the decision of the Council says that the instructions are to be drawn up within a definite stated period by the Commissariat for Agriculture, co-ordinated with the Commissariat for Food and endorsed by the Council of People’s Commissars.
As an exception to the general procedure, when instructions are endorsed by a single order of the People’s Commissar concerned,we arranged not only for verification—the participation of two People’s Commissars—but specially added that the Council of People’s Commissars demanded that the instruc-tions be submitted to it for endorsement.
Obviously, a great deal depended on the instructions.
After certain explanations given by comrades your decision not to give premiums to individual farms became clear to us.
The Central Committee saw the point.
The point is fear of unfair premiums, the giving of premiums to kulaks.
Obviously, the best-run farms are those of the well-to-do peasants and the kulaks, and there are still plenty of these in the villages, on that score we haven’t the slightest doubt.
If we, in paying a premium for an efficient farm, did not take care to find out how that efficiency was achieved, then, naturally, the kulak would prove to have the best-run farm.
And if we ignore the question as to how, at what price, economic improvement is achieved, we shall find the kulak receiving unfair privileges.
If we reward him with the means of production, that is, with things that make for farm expansion, we shall find ourselves indirectly, and perhaps even not quite indirectly, boosting the kulaks, because, in rewarding an industrious farmer without con-sidering whether or not he achieved his good results by kulak practices, and what is more, rewarding him with things like the means of production, that is to say, things he can use to strengthen his influence with, we shall, of course, be running counter to the basic provisions of not only the agrarian, but of all Soviet policy, and infringing the basic principle—that of supporting the interests of the working people against those of the kulaks.
In doing so we shall really be seriously undermining the principles and founda-tions of all Soviet policy in general, and not only of agrarian policy.
But if we are to draw from this the conclusion that indivi-dual farmers should not be rewarded, then take the following example: we give bonuses to individual workers at factories and mills, where collective, socialised, labour has reached an incomparably higher level than in agriculture.
What is to be done about the peasantry then? In a peasant coun-try, where individual peasant labour predominates to the extent of nine-tenths, probably ninety-nine per cent, wherewe have twenty million peasant farms, we want to promote these farms and we must do so come what may.
We know that their efficiency can be raised only after several long years of radical technical reform.
We have learned something in our three years of practical work.
We know how to build up the foundations of communism in agriculture—this can be done at the cost of a tremendous technical evolution.
We clearly visualise that elaborated plan with located electric stations, we know the minimum-programme, the programme for the next ten years, but in this book on electri-fication we also have a maximum-programme, in which gigantic work is planned for years ahead.
But now we have twenty million separate farms, which are run separately and cannot be run in any other way; and if we don’t encourage them to raise productivity this would be grossly wrong, it would be clearly overdoing it, it means a refusal to see facts of reality that strike the eye, facts that we have to reckon with and be guided by.
It would be desirable, of course, to have these farms rise through collectivism, by whole volosts, communes, etc.
But how far that is possible at present is a thing we have to reckon with.
If you, working in the local areas, support progress in this direction and raise a whole commune or a whole volost—all the better; in that case give them all that is best in premium payments.
But are you sure that you will manage it, that it is not sheer fantasy, which in the practical work will lead to the greatest blunders? That is why we propose to you the last part of the C.
C’s resolution reworded or amended as the practical workers may deem fit for inclusion in the resolution of the Congress of Soviets, so that this question should be decided by you and you should say here: premiums and rewards for individ-ual farmers are acceptable under three known conditions.
First, premiums for rural communes first and foremost, with householders coming second and receiving what remains—to this we agree.
The second point says individual farmers who have achieved economic success by kulak practices should not be rewarded; it should not be a case of—you have made a go of it economically, you are to be rewarded.
If anyone has achieved economic success, but employed a kulak method in doing so, whether in the formof a loan, the hiring of labourers, or profiteering—kulak practices sometimes dodge the law—if anyone has employed the slightest kulak method to achieve success, he is to forfeit reward of any kind.
This is the second restriction which goes still further to meet your principled point of view as to combating the kulaks and supporting the Working middle peasants and poor peasants.
The third restriction— what is to be issued as premiums.
They may be given in the form of means of production—things like implements and machines that serve to expand and improve the farm; articles of consumption may be issued, household articles of adornment, things that make the home brighter and life more beautiful.
We say: “Give the individual farmers only consumer and household goods, and, of course, medals.
” You have already accepted the Order of the Red Banner.
293 As to the means of production, these may be given to individual farmers, but of such a type and on such conditions that they should not be usable for kulak purposes.
No machines should be given, not even to the most hardworking farmer, not even if he has achieved success without the least resort to kulak practices.
Machines should not be given, because by the very nature of their employment they require collective labour, and a farmer who receives a machine will not be able to use it by himself.
These are the considerations the C.
C.
was guided by and on the basis of which we have asked you to reconsider your decision, exchange opinions, and alter your decision if you deem it possible so as to allow individual farmers to be rewarded on the three conditions set forth above.
If we do not accept this, we may not achieve needed results, since farm improvements cannot be carried out in a tired and ruined country without a special effort, and the hardworking farmers have to be rewarded.
All hard work that contains no element of kulak practices should be rewarded.
That is why we think that on considering these reasons you will agree to premiums subject to the three restrictive conditions mentioned above, which we think are really necessary in the interests of our economic development.

C.
P.
GROUP OF THE EIGHTH CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECEMBER 27 Before answering the notes it must be stated definitely whether a formal difference of opinion exists between the congress group and the Central Committee.
Dealing with what the first speakers have said here: we adopted a definite decision, intending to fight the kulaks, but at that time you did not have the methods of struggle outlined by us in the three addenda.
What did the comrades who opposed these addenda say here? As a matter of fact they said nothing.
The peasant Red Armyman who spoke here 294 said that the kulaks exist and they are growing, but we say definitely: if they are kulaks they will receive no reward.
You are being asked to make that a law.
Moreover, if the middle peasant achieves betterment individually, but may use it to become a kulak, he is not to receive a premium.
What argument, then, has been advanced here against our reasons? None at all.
It is reiterated that the kulak should not be rewarded.
But we agree to that.
I shall deal now with the notes that have been sent up.
The first one: 1) What will be the criterion for a “hardworking kulak” and a “hardworking middle peasant”? 2) If we do find that criterion here and work out a plan, how are we going to carry it out locally, all the more in places where the kulaks are still playing the leading role? 3) Where is the line to be drawn between rewarding a whole col-lective body and an individual farmer, or are both of them to be re-warded? For one thing, the peasants know this better than we do.
If the law bans any reward for people employing kulak practices, then this is broader than the notion of the kulak.
The kulak is a man who generally uses kulak methods, and one or another kulak method is used by almost every middle peasant.
That means we not only forbid premiums being given to kulaks but to any middle peasant as well, if he uses kulak methods, and these methods are endlessin their variety.
That crude method by which an extra horse was bought for five poods is not the only one.
295 Would a premium be given to a kulak like that? What makes you think that people in the country will close their eyes to this? As to the criterion for a hardworking kulak and a hard-working middle peasant, the local people know this perfectly well.
We have no intention of writing a law about this, as it would mean writing a whole volume describing kulak practices, and people locally know this perfectly well.
Secondly, haven’t we got uyezd committees of the Party, won’t this thing be handled by the rural commune, by the volost land departments, by the Party cell? How can we speak about fighting the kulaks in the local areas if there are no fighting cells there? This argument is beyond me.
Thirdly, the law says that priority is given to the collective body with the individual farmer coming second.
The differentiation will be made in greater detail by the Uyezd Party Committee and all the other bodies that exist locally.
The second note: In introducing its amendment does the C.
C.
regard it as a political act, an incentive to the “hardworking peasants” to improve farming and industry in general so as to make it easier in the course of time to introduce collective cultivation? Will you please answer this? In the first place, here is proof that there is nothing specially political in this question, something that should be kept from the non-Party peasants.
Therefore I consider it quite right and think it should be made a custom to invite non-Party people to our group meetings on such questions.
They will have no right of decision at the group meetings, but why not consult them? Our economic practice has shown that it is advisable to go over from individual to collective labour, but having experienced what this going means, we should not try to take it in our stride, but try to understand the need for doing it, the slower the going the better.
The third note: I think the advocates of commune premiums ought to be asked whether they have enough ploughs and other implements to reward the commune with or not.
If not, it’s not worth talking about.
This argument is incorrect.
Generally speaking, we have few articles usable as premiums, and so few ploughs that,as means of production, we shall not give them to individuals, but only to whole communes.
But why should we not, if we can, give a plough to a peasant who has worked hard to raise productivity? And who is to decide whether he is a kulak element or not? We must lend an ear to what people say lower down.
The next note: Will you please, if possible, answer the following question right now on the back of this note.
The Svyatiye Kresty Uyezd, Stavropol Gubernia, where I work, has had 10,000,000 poods of grain imposed on it for delivery by December 1, 1920.
We have delivered 3,200,000 poods.
Owing to poor fulfilment we are widely practising confiscation of property from kulak elements, and so l ask you again, will you please tell us what we are to do? Should we carry out confiscation, or do it only as a last resort, so as not to ruin the farm? This has no relation to the law we are discussing.
Go on acting the way you have been doing.
In strict conformity with the decree of the Soviet government and your own communist conscience go on freely acting the way you have been doing till now.
The next note: How is the “hardworking kulak” to be distinguished from the con-cept of “hardworking peasant”? Our bill covers all that, and your asking this is an abuse of question time.
Next we are asked: Who can define a hardworking peasant and how, say in any village? If this is to be done by elected or authorised persons in the village, it will mean an abuse of elected and authorised persons.
I have already said that we must make use of our Party.
We have the Committees of Poor Peasants, and in the Ukraine we have their counterpart.
1) Please consider this.
Peasant farmers were given a premium for delivering hemp in 1920.
They received 100 arshins of textiles each, but the village poor haven’t received an arshin yet for 1920.
2) Is the fact taken into consideration that the system of pre-miums to individual farmers is an obstacle in the way of setting up collective farms and partly bolsters up the shaken foundations of capitalism in agriculture? Comrades, you know that individual peasant farms with us are the foundations of capitalism, in a manner of speaking.
There is no doubt about that, and I pointed this out in my report, when I said straight out that the “Sukharevka” we had to fear was not the one that existed on Sukharevka Square or existed secretly on any other square, but the one that sits in the breast of every individual peasant farmer.
* Can we get away from this in a year or two years? We cannot.
But farming has to be improved right now.
You are guided by excellent communist motives, but you want to jump from this floor to that top, and we say—it won’t work, act more carefully and gradually Further: Why don’t the Food Commissariat and other institutions give food products for bonuses to workers of Group 3? I don’t know why, but I should imagine it’s because we have terribly little food products available for bonus payments.
Will you kindly answer this question: What does the C.
C.
of the R.
C.
P.
think of the idea of rewarding the more well-to-do peasants, i.
e.
, those who have large allotments which they work themselves? And at the same time, how do the land-poor peasants stand who have no chance of giving a good account of themselves because they have so little land? Why does he have a large allotment? If it is unfair, why does the commune or the Land Department let him keep it? Because others are not able to cultivate it.
So why punish him, if he works hard on it? If he uses kulak methods, don’t let him do it, if he holds the allotment unfairly, take it away from him and give it to others, to those who will work it, but don’t blame a man for having a lot of land.
In Russia there is no private property, the land is distributed by you yourselves and by the commune.
In Russia there are people who have large amounts of land.
If the Party committee and the Soviet bodies see this and do nothing about it, they should be given the sack, but people should not be deprived of their premiums.
Two more notes.
The first: Will this point of the bill apply to the Ukraine? * See p.
247 of this volume.
—Ed.
I think it will, and I very much regret that not a single one of the comrades working in the Ukrainian Poor Peasants’ Committees has spoken here.
I think the premature closing of the debate a great mistake.
The second one: If the R.
C.
P.
congress group rejects the resolution of the C.
C.
shall we be worthy members of the R.
C.
P.
or just showing our obstinacy? My answer to this note is a document called “Rules of the Russian Communist Party”.
In Clause 62 of this document we read: “On matters relating to its inner life and current work the group is autonomous.
” 296 This means that all members of the group have the right and are bound to vote according to their conscience and not on the instructions of the C.
C.
If, in voting according to your conscience, you pass a second decision against the C.
C’s proposal, we are obliged, on the basis of Clause 62, to summon the Central Committee, and we shall do so at once, and you will send your representa-tives to attend its meeting.
A serious question like this were best discussed two or three times to iron out serious differ-ences of opinion between us.
That is how matters stand, that is how we have to act.
You have to vote now, not because the higher Party body has issued directives, but because you have either been persuaded or you have not.
Comrades here were wrong to say that things must have been in a poor way if Lenin has been sent to speak up for them.
This is not true.
The Party Rules define your rights exactly.
That’s one thing.
Secondly, it isn’t true because there was not a single difference of opinion on this question in the Central Committee, which said outright: We have been carried away by our struggle against the kulaks and have forgotten measure.
Let us remind people about measure.
The C.
C.
appointed two comrades because these two members of the C.
C.
had occasion, during the discussion of the bill, to take a more active part in it than others and spoke in the debates: I handled all the drafts, and so did Preobrazhensky.
That’s why the two of us were appointed.

Written February 1 7 , 1 9 2 1 First published in 1 9 3 2 in Lenin Miscellany XX Printed from the manuscript SPEECH AT A MEETING OF MOSCOW PARTY ACTIVISTS FEBRUARY 24, 1921 310 I am rather surprised at the nature of today’s talk.
I don’t think this is the right political moment for it.
We have to cope with the present situation, which has deteriorated both internally and internationally.
Peace with Poland has not yet been concluded, and at home we have a growth of banditism and kulak revolts.
As for food and fuel, things have gone from bad to worse.
Last year we consumed 15 million poods of grain during the first half-year and 8 million in the second; this year we have used 25 million poods in the first half-year and are now obliged to cut the bread rations and are not even sure we shall be able to issue them regularly.
Obviously our mistake was that we wrongly distributed the grain in the first half-year; we should not have increased its consumption to 25 million poods.
There are no deliveries from Siberia now, because the kulak rebels have cut off the railway.
Our Siberian comrades spoke of the possibility of * See Lenin Miscellany XX, p.

a kulak uprising, but it is very difficult to determine the extent of it.
It is not a war, in which one can weigh the forces engaged in it.
The Siberian peasantry are not yet used to privations, although they are bearing less than the peasantry of European Russia, and there is now a break off in communications with Siberia and stoppage of deliveries.
Between March 1 and 10, approximately, there will be no improvement in the food situation.
We have left ourselves no stocks.
The thing now is to hold out, to bear the present situation with the greatest possible firmness.
There is a certain improvement in deliveries from the Caucasus, but there is a likelihood that things may get worse.
Apparently the uprising in Armenia will quieten down, 311 but deliveries from the Caucasus can in no way compensate us for non-deliveries from Siberia, although pressure is being put on the South-Eastern Railway to make up the losses.
This is sad news, but it can’t be helped.
In the banditism one feels the influence of the Socialist-Revolutionaries.
Their main forces are abroad; every spring they dream of overthrowing Soviet power.
Chernov wrote about this recently in a Russian newspaper abroad.
The S.
R.
s are connected with the local instigators.
This connec-tion is to be seen in the fact that the uprisings take place in the very districts from which we take grain.
The surplus-appropriation system here met with tremendous difficulties.
The same system is being applied in Siberia, but there they still have stocks left over from previous years.
The deterioration has spread to fuel as well.
We have no exact figures, so no clear deductions can be made, nor can we determine the causes of the fuel crisis.
We have come to the conclusion that there exists discontent of a general nature.
This discontent has to be caught from below, directly through the Party apparatus if it cannot be caught quickly through the administrative apparatus.
In addition to signs of bureaucratism, there are mistakes in the plan.
The plan should be checked when it is drawn up by being discussed in the press and at meetings.
We are obliged to stop enterprises and thereby upset the work of factories which do have fuel.
What is the matter? Clearly, besides mistakes, the plan contains material for legal pro-ceedings.
Proletarian elements should be sent into the offices.
Undoubtedly, until the floating season is over, we shall not emerge from the fuel crisis.
We must make the best possible use of sleighing and floating.
The fuel crisis has affected the textile mills, too, and they are unable to fulfil even a minimum programme.
There are the difficulties arising from banditism and interrupted communication with Siberia.
Smirnov’s 312 report says they are coping with banditism out there but cannot promise an improvement in grain deliveries.
Therefore, we should not disperse our attention in talk about the general situation, but concentrate our efforts on finding a way out of this situation.
A word or two about the situation in the Moscow organisa-tion.
Some comrades try to shift the blame for the squabbling on the majority of the Moscow Committee.
If the minority are dissatisfied they can appeal against the conference decision to the Central Committee.
I don’t know how the C.
C.
will decide the question, but my own opinion is that the minority is to blame.
The resolution of the All-Russia Conference says that the opinion of the minority is to be reckoned with and that a discussion and debate is necessary within the Party.
313 At the gubernia conference in November elections to the Moscow Committee took place on this platform.
314 A two-room system was applied, and that is already a rift; such a state of affairs, though, can no longer be tolerated.
We permitted criticism not for the sake of criticism, but to get a correct decision passed.
Moscow has broken the record in discussions.
In November there was talk about the Moscow Committee’s wrong line, and 120 votes were given for it.
During the discussion, when everyone put forward his own platform, the votes against the Moscow Committee were already less.
What democracy is it, if a conference cannot elect the M.
C.
? After a three-month discussion the blame for the squabbling falls on those who are dissatisfied.
Of course, there is the formal right to appeal against a decision, but it is the duty of revolutionaries to rally more closely at difficult moments and not abuse the formal right of appeal.
Sixty-seven Russian newspapers abroad tell us that the S.
R.
s and others count on setting us at odds in the spring at non-Party conferences.
And at such a moment people talkabout appealing against the decision of the conference.
You have got to understand what you can appeal for, when and to what extent.
We gave everyone a chance to have his say, we held a discussion—and the congress will decide, but now we are at our fighting posts.
We have to rally and realise that one more step in the discussion and we are no longer a Party.
While not for a moment denying the right to appeal, I say that we performed our duty even without the discussion and should do our duty now.
We must send Communists to all the non-Party organisations and explain this difficult situation to them.

327 Lenin Written March 1 6 , 1 9 2 1 First published in 1 9 5 9 in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI Printed from the manuscriptMEETING OF THE COMMUNIST GROUP OF THE ALL-RUSSIA CENTRAL COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS APRIL 11, 1921 328 1 REJOINDER DURING THE DEBATE We have just heard exceedingly diplomatic speeches on the part of Comrade Shlyapnikov and Comrade Ryazanov, who although they are now protesting very loudly, are never-theless protesting so diplomatically that they would make highly satisfactory negotiators with concessionaires and with bourgeois states.
We have come to a meeting at which I report on the disagreements that arose in the Central Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars.
The same disagreements will emerge here during the discussion.
.
.
.
These differences were resolved by the decision of the Tenth Congress, which says: “The decree of the C.
P.
C.
shall be approved and a concession shall be granted in Baku and Grozny.
” We want to discuss this question here, that is why I asked that Shlyapnikov’s and Ryazanov’s proposal should be rejected, and they should have their inquisitiveness, not to say curiosity, gratified by the results of the ensuing debate.
First published in 1 9 3 2 in Lenin Miscellany XX Printed from the shorthand record 2 REPLY TO THE DEBATE ON THE REPORT ON CONCESSIONS Comrades, the question was raised here from the very outset whether our differences in regard to concessions were serious or not, and the desire was expressed, incidentally, by Comrade Shlyapnikov that more systematic information be given on each agreement.
I’m afraid this is impracticable, if only for technical reasons.
For instance, take the caseof peace treaties with different countries.
After the general directives, which at first were drafted in great detail, it so fell out that a certain type of treaty with bourgeois countries was adopted by tacit consent, the mass of details being left to the representatives authorised to sign the treaty.
And most of these details are probably unknown to the majority of the members of the Council of People’s Commissars and the Central Committee.
The same here: we were dealing with a question of principle and we thought there was a danger of disagreements arising.
Therefore the Party congress had to step in, and therefore the present meeting, in which only members of the Party are taking part, was a meeting called for the purpose of mutual information.
We have read out to you what the Council of People’s Commissars has adopted.
329 The C.
P.
C.
’s decision was adopted in spite of the motion by two very prominent trade unionists.
What other method of information do the majority of the communist group members have if not through such a meeting as this one? It works out that there were less disagreements than we thought.
This is the most desirable thing for us.
No minutes of this meeting are being kept and we do not intend to have a press discussion on it.
Our purpose has been achieved.
In informing you of the decision of the Council of People’s Commissars, we are letting you know how we have accepted the decision of the Party congress.
The remaining differences of opinion do not exceed those which arise from day to day on various questions and are decided by a simple vote, without becoming a hindrance to the work.
Submission to the majority in that case is not only a matter of form, but an act that does not hinder further work.
I think we have achieved here a result in that no serious differences have come to light, and partial differences will be ironed out in the course of the work itself.
Comrade Ryazanov, characteristically, has tried to drag in disagreements with the Workers’ Opposition.
He specially chose a formulation that was intended to be a teaser, but he failed in this, and none of the speakers fell for it.
One comrade sent in a note saying that we here are con-cluding a second Treaty of Brest.
The first one had turned out well, as to the second one, he has his doubts.
This is partly true, but the present agreement, in the field of economyis something between the Brest Treaty and an agreement with any bourgeois state.
We have already signed several such agreements, including a trade agreement with Britain.
The one on concessions will be something between the Brest Treaty and such agreements with bourgeois states.
Comrade Ryazanov then passed a remark, quite correctly, which I should like to underline at the very outset.
He said that if we want to grant a concession it was not meant to improve the position of the workers, but to raise the produc-tive forces.
Quite right! As to improving the position of the workers, we always stand by this.
I have here a draft agree-ment with a Swedish corporation of ball-bearing plants written by the staff of the Supreme Economic Council 330 (reads).
This agreement does not stipulate any improvement in the condition of the workers.
True, it is so worded that the Russian Government undertakes to supply the workers with everything they need, and if it fails to do this, the capitalists have the right to bring in workers from abroad.
As to the ability of the Russian Government to fulfil everything the plan calls for as far as the workers are concerned, I think that neither we, nor the Supreme Economic Council, nor the Swedes can have any illusions on this score.
At any rate, in this Comrade Ryazanov is quite right, for the main thing in concessions is not improvement of the workers’ condition, but the raising of the productive forces and such a transac-tion under which we are making great sacrifices in order to increase output.
But what are these sacrifices? I have been told that I gloss over these sacrifices, play them down.
Comrade Ryazanov even tried to crack a joke On this score.
I did not play down the sacrifices, I only said that we may have to give the capitalists not only hundreds, but thousands of per cent in profits.
That’s the whole gist of it! If, as I assumed, on the basis of calculations by our specialists, we take 30-40 per cent of the oil, for instance, for ourselves, if the capitalist, out of every 100 million poods of oil which he produces, takes 50-60 million poods for himself, and possessing the transport, sells them at a profit of perhaps 1000 per cent, or maybe more, then the position is clear.
And when I tried to find out from Krasin the terms of his agreement on the basis of his preliminary talks withthe businessmen and tycoons, I asked: “Can one conceive of a type of agreement under which we stipulate a definite percentage of profit for the capitalist, say up to 80 per cent.
” He said: “It is not a question of the size of the profits, because these robbers now make as much as 1000 per cent, not 80.
” To my mind, the sacrifices will be very heavy.
We shall probably have to make great sacrifices if we are going to give concessions on ores or timber, if we are going to give away raw materials which they are so desperately in need of abroad, such as manganese ore, for example.
Georgia has now become Soviet.
The thing is to unite the Caucasian Republics into a single economic centre: the Georgian, Azerbaijan and Armenian Republics.
Azerbaijan produces oil; it has to be transported via Batum through Georgian territory, so there will be a single economic centre.
According to one report, the Georgian Menshevik govern-ment had concluded a concession agreement, which, on the whole, is acceptable to us.
Preliminarily, I could only get in touch with Georgian comrades and ascertain from a talk with Comrade Yenukidze, the Secretary of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, who is himself a Georgian, that he had been there and concluded an agreement—true, not a concession agreement—with the Menshevik Georgian government granting us without resistance one-sixth of Georgia while retaining a guarantee of inviolability.
331 After this agreement, to the signing of which Comrade Yenukidze was a party, they preferred nevertheless, despite the guarantee of inviolability, to quit Batum for Constanti-nople, so that we have gained by this in two ways, positively and negatively—in that we have acquired territory, not for Russia, but for Soviet Georgia—Batum and its environs— and in that we have lost a good many Mensheviks, who have left for Constantinople.
It appears that the Georgian Revolutionary Committee is inclined to confirm the concession on unworked coal-mines, which it considers a very important one.
Two representatives of foreign powers were in Georgia and did not leave at the time of the Soviet coup—the Italian and the German— a most important circumstance, as it is desirable to develop relations with these countries, by means, among others, of concessions.
Italy even had a concession agreement withGeorgia, while in Germany the situation is that some German capitalists own a tremendous per cent of the Chiatura man-ganese mines.
The thing is to transfer the right of ownership to a lease or a concession, that is, to grant on lease to the German capitalists the very mines which they owned as property.
Owing to the change in the political situation in the Caucasus, the circumstances are favourable for con-cession relations.
The important thing for us is to force windows open one after another.
The agreement with Britain 332 was that of a Socialist Republic with a bourgeois state, an agreement that imposed upon us a certain burden.
To the first state with whom we concluded an agreement we gave a much greater part of our gold fund than we have given to others.
But the consequences have shown that thanks to this agreement we have forced open a window of sorts.
It is from this point of view that we should judge every concession.
Germany and Italy, owing to their economic position, are obliged to seek an alliance with Russia.
For Russia, an alliance with Germany opens up vast economic prospects, irrespective of whether or not the German revolution will soon win a victory there.
We can come to terms even with a bourgeois government in Germany, because the Versailles Treaty has made Germany’s position impossible, whereas an alliance with Russia opens up entirely different possibilities.
Since Italy has no fuel resources of her own, they have taken a coal-mining concession in the Caucasus at coal-fields that have never been worked before.
I should not be surprised to see the Germans hankering after oil concessions, as Germany has no fuel at all.
One of the comrades here said that the Kamchatka conces-sion would not improve the condition of the workers.
That is absolutely wrong.
And Comrade Ryazanov was quite wrong when he tried to crack a joke about our dealings with Vanderlip turning out to be a Vander-slip.
True, we made one mistake—our telegram to Harding.
But since we have had no agreements or relations with America till now, there was no mistake on our part, and we only found out that Vanderlip had been boasting of his connections with the American Administration.
Now it is quite possible that in sending our representatives to Canada, where we are to buylocomotives, that through this side door we may gain some access to the American market.
Negotiations for Kamchatka concessions are beginning to stir now, and it is quite wrong to say that these concessions will not improve the condition of the workers.
If these concessions materialise, there will be an undoubted improvement in the condition of the workers, because we shall be receiving a certain deduction share, 2 per cent I believe, and when we have nothing at all, even 2 per cent is something.
If we get 20,000 out of one million and use it for an exchange with the peasants, this will give us some of the products the workers need.
Further I wanted to point out that some of the remarks you have made here show that there are disagreements among the trade unionists, or rather perplexities, which are the only real danger and which we, among ourselves, perhaps by further discussions among the Party members, have to eliminate.
For example, Comrade Marshev spoke about payment having to be made in cash, and not by coupons.
As to the Amsterdamists 333 and whether they will attack us, we must come to an arrangement about this.
I recently re-read my pamphlet written in May 1918.
* I quoted in it the Menshevik newspaper Vperyod 334 in which the Menshevik Isuv accused the Soviet government of agreeing to concessions, of having deals with bourgeois states.
It is an old trick of the Mensheviks to blame us for granting concessions.
Quite a few groups have already taken shape in this connection in Western Europe.
The Communists understand that concessions are a treaty of Brest, which we are obliged to put up with because of the ruined state of a country with a predominantly peasant population.
Everyone understands that regeneration of the country with-out a big industry is unthinkable.
The Communists of Germany understand why we have to give ground, but the Scheidemanns and the II 2 Interna-tional say that these concessions are proof of our complete failure, and I remember at a meeting last year I mentioned the American chauvinist Spargo, ** who specialised in * See Vol.

writing a heap of books about the Bolsheviks in the vein of our Alexinsky, and in connection with the concessions he all but performed a dance of triumph.
I mentioned at the time that this was an utter distortion.
Yesterday inter-national capital was out to strangle us, and today we have a number of agreements with this international capital.
We are making sacrifices in giving away to foreign capital millions’ worth of valuable materials from which they can make profits running into hundreds of per cent.
These are sacrifices which we are making deliberately and consciously.
But at the same time we should note that while allowing them to make any profit they like, we are receiving the advantages we need ourselves, i.
e.
, increased output, and as far as possible an improvement in the condition of our workers, both those employed at the concession enterprises and those not so employed.
Comrade Shlyapnikov said here that it would be a good thing to grant a concession to Russian workers.
The idea is absurd.
We would then have to guarantee fuel, etc.
, a thing which we can’t guarantee even to our most essential enterprises.
We are bad off for fuel.
The idea of a concession agreement with Russian workers, generally speaking, is permissible in principle, but such a solution of the problem for our big industry is not serious, since we cannot guarantee them anything, whereas foreign concessionaires can bring in supplies from abroad.
That is what distinguishes the agreement with foreign capitalists.
They have the world market, we have no secure economic base and would have to spend ten years creating it.
This is what we must soberly take into account.
All our people engaged in this problem have proved this situation.
We know that the electrification plan is the most econom-ical one.
We cannot lease our big factories to the Russian workers.
We must stake here on small industry, develop it and not rail at our tax-in-kind measures the way Comrade Ryazanov does, or the author of that pamphlet which says that we are putting through anarcho-syndicalist laws.
As regards the development of small industry, we must take several steps, as we can get something out of it right now without state guarantees, and since we cannot guaranteeeven our most essential factories, we must do everything we can to develop small industry, which will give us a certain amount of produce which the peasants need.
On the question of cash or coupons I would say this: it would be something to fear if the capitalists had the power, but we have nothing to fear, since all the factories and enter-prises are in our hands, and we haven’t leased a tenth part of them to the capitalists.
I repeat, we have nothing to fear from coupons, as the capitalists will be obliged to stock the goods we tell them to, not just salted fish, as was mentioned here, but such-and-such products.
Since we are taking the norm of a foreign worker, we know that under this norm he gets even more and better products than the Russian worker does.
Comrade Shlyapnikov here said: “We have seen conces-sions.
” Both Comrade Shlyapnikov and many practical workers make this mistake.
I have heard people say: “Your idea of concessions is schematic.
The capitalist has always tricked the most experienced Russian lawyers.
” To be sure he did, when state power was in the capitalist’s hands and he was all-powerful.
What was that state power? A committee for the affairs of the propertied master class—that’s what it was.
A committee for the affairs of the landowners and capitalists—that was what the capitalist government was.
But if we, having in our hands most of the factories, mills and railways, with our Party standing at the head—with communist cells below and Communists on top—if we do not hold our own in such conditions, then we might as well commit suicide.
And that is panic! We are not that bad though, I think, to allow ourselves to be tricked, and if we have already concluded several agreements in which the governments in France and Britain had the services of first-class bourgeois diplomats, and if even under these conditions we have not once been tricked, then why should we panic at the idea of being tricked by coupons? Let me remind you of the treaty of Brest.
In what way was this treaty difficult? What were the difficulties of defence? When I was asked whether I had any hopes of our being able to fool the Germans, I was obliged, in my official capacity, to say that I did not.
But now the treaty of Brest is past history.
I don’t know whether the pamphlet Comrade Kamenev was preparing has come out (it deals there with Ludendorf), but I do know that Ludendorf has written a brilliant volume of memoirs in which ten pages are devoted to the Brest negotia-tions.
When Kamenev and I read that chapter we said: “This is the best justification of the Brest Treaty.
” He tells how Trotsky and the others had driven them into a corner during the talks, how they were outwitted, and so on.
We decided there and then that these pages had to be trans-lated and published with a short preface by Comrade Kamenev, and the fact that this hasn’t been done yet is a specimen of Soviet ineptitude.
Or take a fact like this.
We know that Comrade Joffe, our Ambassador to the German Government, was expelled from Germany on the eve of the revolution there.
After this, don’t try to guess who is going to trick whom.
Don’t let us lay down how many days will pass between the conclusion of the first concession agreement and the first big European revolution.
That is why, on the question of agreements, I maintain that the com-rades are absolutely wrong.
There’s nothing to worry about.
The agreements will say what goods they are to have and at what price.
We can agree to any coupons or ration books.
If they break the agreement we have the right to cancel it immediately.
The agreement is a civil contract.
I haven’t gone into the question of what arbitration there is to be and who is to settle disputes, but I shall run through the initial draft of the agreement with the Swedish corporation.
It says here: “Differences are settled.
.
.
.
” People here have brought academicians into play, and these will try to bring the lawyers into play.
I remember Bebel saying that lawyers were the most reactionary and at the same time bourgeois, people.
Of course, we can mend this somehow, but there is nothing at all to worry about.
If the concessionaires were to lay down this condition we could accept it.
Once the agreement stipulates precisely that there are to be such-and-such goods and payment on the ration book is to be made in such-and-such a way, we can agree to this, and the Socialist Republic has nothing to fear from coupons or ration books.
It was further stated that Point 9 was bad because we would be drawing away from the international T.
U.
C.
335 Lozovsky threatened that theAmsterdam people would slam us, but they will slam us all the same on all other points, and end up, as always, with slamming themselves.
You remember how the Mensheviks intended slamming us for having made the slightest concessions to the capitalists.
When we wanted to overthrow capitalism, they said we would overthrow it only for a few days, but when we have overthrown it for a few years, they are trying to set another trap for us.
They are trying to lure the enemy into a spot where he is sure to be beaten.
First they called us utopians, then invited us to jump from the fifth floor.
We know that we have many small businesses.
Petty proprietors are our opponents.
The petty-bourgeois element is our most dangerous enemy.
Brokers and leaseholders are the lesser enemy.
Bureaucracy, too, and bureaucratic abuses are our enemy.
In regard to the point Comrade Lozovsky spoke about, I will say this—listen to it carefully.
It says: “The trade unions shall not have the right to demand application of Russian pay rates or of Russian rules of employment to that category of workers.
” It speaks here of the Russian trade unions, and I am told about the international unions.
Naturally, when the capitalists see the Russian terms, they say they are communist terms, ridiculous terms, and that the Russian trade unions have no right to demand Russian terms of employment, which are likely to be pretty stiff and far-fetched, but they do have a full right to apply international trade union agreements.
This is good enough.
Nothing is mentioned here about strikes, about their being banned.
The thing is to be able not to mention everything before its time.
As to improving the condition of the Russian worker, Comrade Marshev and Tartakovsky have made an attack here, saying you won’t be able to cope with the workers, you won’t be able to make them work, because if you provide for one-fifth of them, the other four-fifths won’t want to work under worse conditions.
Do you mean to say we are dealing with workers who are so foolish, uncultivated and undiscip-lined? If so, then the only thing is to panic and commit sui-cide.
If a hundred workers are underfed and we tell them that we can feed twenty, and no more, do you mean to say theywill refuse it? So far we have not come up against anything like it.
We have managed somehow to feed workers in certain branches of industry, but not all of them, yet the workers didn’t all run away from these enterprises, whereas they all did from other enterprises.
Can the Russian worker be so spoilt by the mistakes of Soviet power that he cannot figure out that it were better to feed at least 20 people than to make the whole hundred go hungry? There is a good deal here that ought not to be spoken about before its time.
Why can’t it be arranged for people to take turns in working for the capitalists? The workers would work six months, get working clothes, then give others a chance to feed up.
Of course, we shall have to break down prejudices here.
When concessionaires come here, we must restrain our trade unions from making excessive demands.
You know that the usual term of an agreement is a short one.
In Europe there are no long-term agreements.
The usual term is six months.
In this way the workers will be able to feed up, get boots and clothes, then quit and make way for others.
Is it so impossible to arrange things so that a man works six months, feeds up, gets American boots and clothes, and makes room for the next man? It will be difficult, of course.
It will demand a higher degree of organisation and discipline than we have, but it is not impossible.
If we have contrived to keep a hold on the workers against an invasion of foreign capital during three years of terrible famine, do you mean to say we won’t manage it this time? I realise only too well what difficulties confront us here.
And therefore I say that concessions do not signify the advent of peace among the classes.
Concessions are a continuation of the war among the classes.
If previously the war could be expressed in—I’ll get you through starvation and you’ll get nothing, now I say that I want to give the workers a pair of boots each, but I want them to work six months.
And we’ll fight for all the workers getting boots.
We do not reject strikes, all this remains in our hands, if only we are reasonable and try to put the accent now on what we can do to attract the capitalists.
People here have talked about what a great danger this is, saying that the capitalist will come and trick us, but I assert that there is no danger, and that in the interests of raisingproductivity it is desirable that he should come, because he has a splendidly organised base and splendidly equipped factories, where we can order the necessary parts without having to buy them on the open market, where there is only junk.
The first-class factories have their orders booked up for several years ahead.
Even if we paid in gold we would not receive anything, whereas a member of the syndicate would get everything he wanted.
We wouldn’t mind paying him extra if it meant improving the condition of at least a small section of the workers and peasants, because each extra product will go to the peasants in exchange for grain, and that will create stable relations between the working class and the peasantry.
Winding up, I would ask the trade unionists to waive questions of principle and disputes.
All these are idle dis-putes, sheer scholasticism.
They should be dropped.
Attention should be wholly directed to those practical terms of con-cession agreements from which we, if we are sensible, may derive benefit for ourselves.
The trade unionists and Party leaders should display here their inventiveness and practical knowledge of conditions, of which we cannot and shall not speak about in the press, because the Russian press is being followed by the capitalists, just as during the Brest talks we did not speak about the instructions that had been given to Comrade Joffe.
We shall give practical attention to the practical methods by which we can derive benefit in the way of improving the condition of the workers and peasants.
Every such improvement is of tremendous importance to us.
This is where the trade unionists should give their attention.
All trace of friction and prejudice should be eliminated.
It is a difficult business.
So far no one has been willing to conclude a concession agreement with us.
They are all expecting us to present impracticable demands.
We, therefore, on our part must use every effort to con-clude several such agreements.
Of course, we shall make a number of mistakes.
It is a new business.
So far no socialist republic has ever granted concessions to capitalists.
But we want the trade unionists to help us.
There is vast scope here for interpretations and pressure, including strikes, which remain in our hands.

Contents: the experience of non-Party conferences has fully proved that they have become an arena for agitation ** by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries; therefore, the greatest care must be taken in organising non-Party conferences, by no means allowing them to be held without thorough preparation at each respective factory.
The Gubernia Party Committees should be answerable to the Party for the success of every non-Party conference.

Party conference, but prior to every non-Party conference, setting forth its conditions and preparedness.
At the same time it is absolutely essential to step up the work of preserving and developing the Communists’ ties with the non-Party masses.
For this purpose it is necessary: not only to regularly hold general meetings for the rank-and-file workers and peasants, but arrange business reports to the rank-and-file workers and peasants by officials holding key posts.
Such reports must be delivered at least once a month in order that the non-Party rank-and-file be given an opportunity to criticise the Soviet institutions and their work.
Reports are to be made not only by Communists, but by all officials in top posts, first and foremost those of the food supply and economic council agencies.
Every gubernia committee is obliged to forward exact information monthly to the Central Committee about the number and progress of all these reports, as well as the demands made by the non-Party people at these meetings.
The C.
C.
will draw up more detailed instructions on the organisation of such reports, on the measures for checking ties with the masses, on the progress of the work for improv-ing their condition, and on fighting the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries, who are acting under the guise of non-Party people, etc.

He also pointed out that every member of the Party should not lose touch with the non-Party masses, as often happens with us.
Each one of us, therefore, must keep closer to the non-Party masses and carry on more propaganda.
In conclusion he said: All of you, who often read the newspa-pers and attend meetings and lectures, being more developed people, should do more work among the peasants, carry on agitation among them to explain the significance of the tax in kind.
We shall then achieve better results.

Group of the Trade Union Congress The Central Committee approves Comrade Chubar’s theses (adopted by the group’s bureau) and rejects Comrade Holtz-mann’s theses in view of the fact that the former far more correctly take into consideration the actual state of our resources, capabilities and means, which entail the necessity of planning slower realisation of our immediate aims.
The latter theses, those of Comrade Holtzmann, on the other hand, verge on the fantastic in many ways, they are out of touch with reality, which is also one of the failings of Comrade Larin, who zealously supports these theses.
The only important similarity between the two theses, practically speaking, is the idea expressed in the note to Point 3 of Chubar’s theses * and in Point 6 ** of Holtzmann’s theses, both comrades confirming here, and not disputing, the decision passed by the C.

It is now incumbent on the trade unions, on the strength of the decision they have made, to achieve an unusually rapid reduction in the number of enterprises and workers by concentrating the latter in a minimum of the best and biggest enterprises.

(B .
) 357 MAY 26-28, 1921 1 STATEMENT CONCERNING THE AGENDA MAY 26 Comrades, as I have already told you, we intended to have a single item on the agenda in keeping with the nature of this conference, namely, the question of economic policy.
The remaining reports were to be informational, so I did not prepare a political report, but I think this report will have to be dealt with on an economic plane.
Therefore, in order to satisfy everybody, I suggest that supplementary questions be put to me after the report and I shall answer them in my summing-up speech.
I repeat, I have made no preparations whatever on this question and cannot imagine what I would speak about if I had to apart from the question of the tax in kind.
First published in 1 9 6 3 in the Fifth Russian Edition of the Collected Works, Vol.
4 3 Printed from the shorthand record 2 SPEECHES DURING THE DEBATE OF THE MOTION ON QUESTIONS OF THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY MAY 28 1 I believe this amendment 358 should not be adopted, because an explanation to the amendment would then be needed.
Naturally, if there is a revolution in Europe we shall change our policy.
Civil war, which such a revolution always involves, as you know, may in fact render our position even worse.
Of course, this will be a short time, it is difficult, of course, to determine how long civil war in other republicswill last, but when it is over and won we shall change our policy in the sense that we may say: we shall take nothing in taxes, and only by commodity exchange.
This has to be made clear to the peasants, otherwise they will think: what’s this, back again to the surplus-appropriation system? I believe, therefore, that it were best not to add anything of this kind.
Long years of revolution in Europe and civil war will lead to commodity exchange without any tax at all.
This is stated in the resolution before the congress, which says that the tax will gradually be reduced.
This is the point the forthcoming victorious revolution applies to, a revolution which a long period of years turns into a short one.
2 359 Comrades, it was on this point that we had discussions in the committee, where opinion was divided.
At first Milyutin objected to the words “anarchic commodity ex-change to be combated” on the grounds that this would be con-strued as cavilling, and freedom to trade would, in practice, be done away with.
When this point was drawn up in its present wording, which said: “anarchic commodity exchange to be combated” since “it eludes all control and supervision”— by this is meant the black-market “bagmen”, and you know that illicit trade is punishable in all countries where there is freedom of trading, even in capitalist countries; on this point we see eye to eye.
In what way is it to be combated? By having commodity exchange concentrated chiefly in the hands of the co-operatives, to which is added: “without, however, any restrictions on regular free market operations.
” When this wording was adopted the committee unanimously agreed that there was still a danger of free market operations being restricted.
This is a delicate matter, of course.
We don’t want this ruling to restrict freedom to trade, but we can’t do without measures against illicit trade, specifically against black-market bagmen and transport dislocation.
The committee thought of using a milder word than “combat-ing”, but then agreed that the target was only anarchic commodity exchange that eluded all control on the part of the state, all the more as this was qualified by the added proviso, saying “without, however, any restrictions on regular free market operations”.
With this addition, the word “combat” is not too strong an expression.
The amend-ment which the comrade here proposes is risky in the sense that we shall be defeating our own purpose.
He throws out the words “without, however, any restrictions on regular market operations.
.
.
.
” 3 360 I think the state farms are not equal to this, they are still very weak.
Let them improve a bit for another year, and the next year we shall see whether we can expand their initiative or not.
4 The last amendment is an unhappy one, 361 since the ques-tion of material resources is covered by Point 5: “Revision of (certain sections of) production programmes for large-scale industry with a view to increasing the manufacture of consumer goods and peasant household articles.
“Extension of the independence and initiative of each large establishment in the matter of disposing of financial and material resources.
A precise decision to that effect to be submitted for approval to the Council of People’s Commis-sars.
” Therefore, we shall not repeat this here.
The question of material distribution, that of food, for example, is stated here quite definitely, without prejudice, of course, to the centre, because without it being gathered in the centre there can be no question of industry.
As regards the first remark of the comrade who said that it was inappropriate just now to consider the question of the local economic conferences settled, as these might upset things—I have not heard anything about this.
On the contrary, there have been demands to introduce economic conferences everywhere, acting as commissions of the C.

itself, and locally, too, there are to be no special staffs, no specialbodies, but the same offices and departments.
The gubernia economic conference is a perfectly suitable form, which does not hamper, but facilitates the conference.
As the Instructions say: “with leeway in modifying the main type, that is, the executive committees may assume all the functions and duties of the economic conferences.
.
.
” (reads), so that there is no ruling prescribing an absolutely hard-and-fast and single course of action.
Besides, the resolution proposed by the commission says: “Adopt in principle.
” The commission 362 is meeting and functioning, its Chairman Osinsky tells us they have reviewed quite a number of points and already submitted them in writing.
The work is of a difficult nature, and it will require another special commis-sion.
The fear that we shall be tying our hands by declaring that it is adopted in principle is therefore groundless.
5 363 We have no objection; judging by the subject, however, it does not belong here, but to Point 6.
364 I propose that it be adopted in principle and placed under Point 6.
6 365 These are mere details.
The question should be raised at the session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and discussed with the people concerned.
There can be no objection in principle, but generally speaking this is a detail.
7 366 This fear is excessive here.
Point 7 of our resolution says “The need to maintain and enforce the apparatus for the full and expeditious collection of the tax in kind”.
Naturally, the tax in kind will be collected not by persuasion, it can be collected only by compulsion, and that is what the apparatus stands for.
Today several important decisions and instructions havebeen signed, all aimed at preserving and strengthening the apparatus, from which we shall demand expeditious collec-tion of the tax in kind.
It is pointed out that we say here: “commodity exchange is brought to the fore” and the fear is expressed that the peasants will understand this as priority for commodity exchange.
In that case we shall write: “holds a specially important place.

KUUSINEN AND REMARKS ON THE DRAFT “THESES ON THE ORGANISATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMUNIST PARTIES, ON THE METHODS AND CONTENT OF THEIR WORK” To Comrade Kuusinen Urgent.
Address: from Finnish comrades or at the Comintern.
10/VI.
Comrade Kuusinen, I have read your article (3 chapters) and the theses with great pleasure.
I enclose my remarks in connection with the theses.
I advise you to immediately find a German comrade (a real German) to improve the German text (of the article and the theses).
Perhaps this comrade, on your behalf, would read your article as a report at the Third Congress (it would be much more convenient for the German delegates to hear a German.
369 My advice is—cross out the end (of the theses).
Re propaganda and agitation—much greater detail— especially on the press, but also on verbal propaganda.
I think you should definitely take upon yourself the report at this congress I shall write to Zinoviev about this today.
Best regards, Yours, Lenin Theses (Thesis 6 or) §6, 2nd par.
, last sentence should read: “.

environment.
.
.

” And the next sentence should read: “.
.
.
the Communist Party should overcome this tendency by systematic and persistent organisational work and repeated improvements and corrections.
.
.
.
” (Thesis 7 or) §7: It should be stated at greater length that this is exactly what is lacking in most of the legal parties of the West.
There is no everyday work (revolutionary work) by every member of the Party.
This is the chief drawback.
To change this is the most difficult job of all.
But this is the most important.
§10.
This needs amplifying.
More details.
Examples.
The role of the newspaper.
“Our” newspaper compared with the usual capitalist newspaper.
Work for “our” newspaper.
Example: Russian newspapers of 1912-13.
The fight against the bourgeois papers.
Exposure of their venality, their lies, etc.
Distribution of leaflets.
Home agitation.
Sunday outings, etc.
Far more details.
§11—far more details here too.
§13.
Presenting reports and discussion of reports in the “cells”.
Reports on hostile and especially on petty-bourgeois organisations (the Labour Party, the Socialist parties, etc.
).
Greater detail about duties among the mass of the unorgan-ised proletariat and of the proletariat organised in the yellow trade unions (including the II and II 2 Internationals) and the non-proletarian sections of the working people.
§§ 26 and 27.
This is irrelevant.
This is not an “organisational question”.
This subject had better be dealt with in a special article for the Communist International, say: “Organisational Questions in Revolutionary Periods” and so forth.
Or: “On the Question of Mounting Revolution and Our Corresponding Tasks” (on the basis of Russian and Finnish experience).

KUUSINEN AND W.
KOENEN 370 To Comrades Kuusinen and Koenen 9/VII.
1921 Dear Comrades, I read your draft theses on the organisational question with great pleasure.
I think you have done a very good job.
May I suggest just two addenda:1) advice—control commissions consisting of the best, tried and experienced workers to be formed in all parties; 2) re spies—a special point in connection with the question of illegal work.
Contents roughly as follows: the bourgeoisie is bound to infiltrate spies and provoca-teurs into the illegal organisations.
A thoroughgoing and unremitting struggle should be waged against this, and a method of struggle to be specially recommended is a skilful combination of legal work with illegal, verification (of fitness for illegal work) by means of prolonged legal work.

3 Printed from the manuscript Translated from the German 3 REMARKS ON THE DRAFT THESES ON TACTICS FOR THE THIRD CONGRESS OF THE COMMUNIST INTERNATIONAL LETTER TO G.
Y.
ZINOVIEV 372 The crux of the matter is that Levi in very many respects is right politically.
Unfortunately, he is guilty of a number of breaches of discipline for which the Party has expelled him.
Thalheimer’s and Béla Kun’s theses are politically utterly fallacious.
Mere phrases and playing at Leftism.
Radek is vacillating and has spoilt his original draft by a number of concessions to “Leftist” silliness.
His first “concession” is highly characteristic: in § 1 of his theses “Umgrenzung der Fragen” he first had “winning the majority of the working class (to the principles of communism)” (mark this).
Amended (verballhornt) to: “winning the socially decisive sections of the working class.
” A gem! To weaken here, in such a context, the necessity of winning precisely the majority of the working class “to the principles of communism,” is the height of absurdity.
To win power, you need, under certain conditions (even when the majority of the working class have already been won over to the principles of communism) a blow dealt at the decisive place by the majority of the socially decisive sections of the working class.
To modify, verballhornen, this truth in such a way that § 1 of the general tasks of the Communist International about winning the working class to the principles of commu-nism weakens the idea about the necessity of winning the majority of the working class, is a classic example of Béla Kun’s and Thalheimer’s ineptitude (it looks all right, dammit, but it’s all damn’d wrong) and of Radek’s .
.
.
hasty complaisance.
Radek’s theses were much too long and boneless, and lacked a political central point.
And Radek diluted them still more, spoilt them hopelessly.
What’s to be done? I don’t know.
So much time and effort wasted.
If you don’t want an open fight at the congress, then propose: 1) that Thalheimer’s and B.
Kun’s theses be rejected by exact voting this very day (since Bukharin assures me that the basic points have to be settled not later than today: they were better postponed) as being basically erroneous.
Have this recorded.
You will spoil everything if you don’t do this and show indulgence.
2) that Radek’s first draft, “unimproved” by any correc-tions, one specimen of which I have quoted, should be adopted as a basis.
3) that 1-3 persons be entrusted with cutting down the text and improving it so that it is no longer boneless (if that is possible!) and clearly, precisely and unequivocally puts into focus as the central ideas the following: None of the Communist Parties anywhere have yet won the majority (of the working class), not only as regards organisational leadership, but to the principles of communism as well.
This is the basis of everything.
To “weaken” this foun-dation of the only reasonable tactic is criminal irresponsibility.
Hence: revolutionary explosions are possible nevertheless very soon considering the abundance of inflammable materialin Europe; an easy victory of the working class—in exceptionable cases—is also possible.
But it would be absurd now to base the tactics of the Communist International on this possibility; it is absurd and harmful to write and think that the propaganda period has ended and the period of action has started.
The tactics of the Communist International should be based on a steady and systematic drive to win the majority of the working class, first and foremost within the old trade unions.
Then we shall win for certain, whatever the course of events.
As for “winning” for a short time in an exceptional-ly happy turn of events—any fool can do that.
Hence: the tactic of the Open Letter 373 should definitely be applied everywhere.
This should be said straight out, clearly and exactly, because waverings in regard to the “Open Letter” are extremely harmful, extremely shameful and extremely widespread .
We may as well admit this.
All those who have failed to grasp the necessity of the Open Letter tactic should be expelled from the Communist Inter-national within a month after its Third Congress.
I clearly see my mistake in voting for the admission of KAPD.
374 It will have to be rectified as quickly and fully as possible.
Instead of spinning a long yarn like Radek, we had better have the whole text of the Open Letter translated (and in German quoted in full), its significance properly brought home and adopted as a model.
I would confine the general resolution on tactics to this.
Only then will the tone be set.
The central idea will be clear.
There will be no woolliness.
No possibility of everyone reading his own meaning into it (like in Radek’s).
Radek’s original draft would then be cut down to a quar-ter, at least.
It is time we stopped writing and voting brochures instead of theses.
Under this system partial mistakes are inevitable with any of us, even when the matter is indisputable.
And when we have something boneless and disputable we are bound to make b i g mistakes and spoil the whole thing.
And then, if you have the itch for it, you can add a supple-ment: on the basis of such a tactic, specifically by way of example, precisely as an example and not as a principle, we add so-and-so and so-and-so.
Further.
To generalise Serrati and Levi into the same “opportunism” is stupid.
Serrati is guilty; of what? It should be said clearly and precisely—on the Italian question, and not on the question of general tactics.
Of having split with the Commu-nists and not having expelled the reformists, Turati & Co.
Until you have carried this out, Italian comrades, you are outside the Communist International.
We are expelling you.
375 And to the Italian Communists—serious advice and the demand: so long as you have not been able by persistence, patience and skill to convince and win over the majority of the Serratian workers, don’t swagger, don’t play at Leftism.
“Fall Levi”* is not in general tactics, but in the appraisal of Märzaktion, ** on the German question.
Brandler says: there was a defensive.
The government provoked it.
Assuming this is true, that it is a fact.
What deduction is to be drawn from this? 1) That all the shouting about an offensive—and there was any amount of it—was erroneous and absurd; 2) that it was a tactical error to call for a general strike once there was provocation on the part of the government, who wanted to draw the small fortress of communism into the struggle (the district in the centre where the Communists already had a majority).
3) Mistakes like this must be avoided in future, as the situation in Germany is a special one after the killing of 20,000 workers in the civil war through the skilful manoeuvres of the Right.
4) To call the defensive of hundreds of thousands of workers (Brandler says a million.
Isn’t he mistaken? Isn’t he exaggerating? Why are there no figures by regions and cit-ies???) a “putsch”, and a “Bakuninist putsch” at that, is worse than a mistake, it is a breach of revolutionary discipline.
Since Levi added to this a number of other breaches (list them very carefully and exactly) he deserves his punishment and has earned his expulsion.
The term of expulsion should be fixed, say, at six months at least.
He should then be permitted to seek readmission * The Levi case.

** The March action.

to the Party, and the Communist International advises that he be readmitted provided he has acted loyally during that time.
I have not yet read anything, apart from Brandler’s pamphlet, and am writing this on the basis of Levi’s and Brandler’s pamphlets.
Brandler has proved one thing—if he has proved anything—that the Märzaktion was not a “Bakuninist putsch” [for such abusive language Levi ought to be expelled] but a heroic defence by revolutionary workers, hundreds of thousands of them; but however heroic it was, in future such a challenge, provoked by the government, which, since I.
1919, has already killed by provocations 20,000 workers should not be accepted until the Communists have the majority behind them all over the country, and not just in one small district.
((The July days of 1917 were not a Bakuninist putsch.
For such an appraisal we would have expelled a person from the Party.
The July days were an heroic offensive.
And the deduction we drew was that we would not launch the next heroic offensive prematurely.
Premature acceptance of a general battle—that is what the Märzaktion really was.
Not a putsch, but a mistake, mitigated by the heroism of a defensive by hundreds of thousands.
)) Concerning "meral.
Can’t we have at least 2 or 3 documents? There would be no harm in having at least 2 documents (2-4 pages each) on each country printed for the Comintern.
What are the facts about "meral? about Strasser? Do not forget one of the chief things—to delete from Radek’s first theses everything relating to the “waiting party”, to its censure.
It must all come out.
376 Regarding Bulgaria, Serbia (Yugoslavia?) and Czecho-slovakia, the question of these countries must be put con-cretely, specially, clearly, and precisely.
If opinion is divided on this, I suggest convening the Politbureau.

3 Printed from the manuscript 5 SPEECHES AT A MEETING OF MEMBERS OF THE GERMAN, POLISH, CZECHOSLOVAK, HUNGARIAN AND ITALIAN DELEGATIONS JULY 11 1 I read certain reports yesterday in Pravda which have persuaded me that the moment for an offensive is perhaps nearer than we thought at the congress, and for which the young comrades attacked us.
I shall deal with these reports later, however.
Just now I want to say that the nearer the general offensive is, the more “opportunistically” must we act.
You will now all return home and tell the workers that we have become more reasonable than we were before the Third Congress.
You should not be put out by this; you will say that we made mistakes and now wish to act more carefully; by doing so we shall win the masses over from the Social-Democratic and Independent Social-Democratic parties, masses, who, objectively, by the whole course of events, are being pushed towards us, but who are afraid of us.
I wantto cite our own example to show you that we must act more carefully.
At the beginning of the war we Bolsheviks adhered to a single slogan—that of civil war, and a ruthless one at that.
We branded as a traitor everyone who did not support the idea of civil war.
But when we came back to Russia in March 1917 we changed our position entirely.
When we returned to Russia and spoke to the peasants and workers, we saw that they all stood for defence of the homeland, of course in quite a different sense from the Mensheviks, and we could not call these ordinary workers and peasants scoundrels and traitors.
We described this as “honest defencism”.
I intend to write a big article about this and publish all the material.
On April 7 I published my theses, in which I called for caution and patience.
* Our original stand at the begin-ning of the war was correct: it was important then to form a definite and resolute core.
Our subsequent stand was correct too.
It proceeded from the assumption that the masses had to be won over.
At that time we already rejected the idea of the immediate overthrow of the Provisional Government.
I wrote: “It should be overthrown, for it is an oligarchic, and not a people’s government, and is unable to provide peace or bread.
But it cannot be over-thrown just now, for it is being kept in power by the workers’ Soviets and so far enjoys the confidence of the workers.
We are not Blanquists, we do not want to rule with a minority of the working class against the majority.
” ** The Cadets, who are shrewd politicians, immediately noticed the contradiction between our former position and the new one, and called us hypocrites.
But as, in the same breath, they had called us spies, traitors, scoundrels and German agents, the former appellation made no impression.
The first crisis occurred on April 20.
Milyukov’s Note on the Dardanelles showed the government up for what it was— an imperialist government.
After this the armed masses of the soldiery moved against the building of the government and overthrew Milyukov.
They were led by a non-Party man named Linde.
This movement had not been organised * See Vol.

by the Party.
We characterised that movement at the time as follows: something more than an armed demonstration, and something less than an armed uprising.
At our conference on April 22 the Left trend demanded the immediate over-throw of the Government.
The Central Committee, on the contrary, declared against the slogan of civil war, and we instructed all agitators in the provinces to deny the out-rageous lie about the Bolsheviks wanting civil war.
On April 22 I wrote that the slogan “Down with the Provisional Government” was incorrect, since if we did not have the majority of the people behind us this slogan would be either an empty phrase or adventurism.
* We did not hesitate in face of our enemies to call our Leftists “adventurists”.
The Mensheviks crowed over this and talked about our bankruptcy.
But we said that any attempt to be slightly, if only a wee bit, left of the C.
C.
was folly, and those who stood left of the C.
C.
had lost ordinary common sense.
We refuse to be intimidated by the fact that our enemies rejoice at our slips.
Our sole strategy now is to become stronger, hence cleverer, more sensible, more “opportunistic”, and that is what we must tell the masses.
But after we shall have won over the masses by our reasonableness, we shall use the tactic of offensive in the strictest sense of that word.
Now about the three reports: 1) The strike of Berlin’s municipal workers.
Municipal workers are mostly conservative people, who belong to the Social-Democrats of the majority and to the Independent Social-Democratic Party; they are well off, but are compelled to strike.
378 2) The strike of the textile workers in Lille.
379 3) The third fact is the most important.
A meeting was held in Rome to organise the struggle against the fascists, in which 50,000 workers took part—representing all parties— Communists, socialists and also republicans.
Five thou-sand ex-servicemen came to the meeting in their uniforms and not a single fascist dared to appear on the street.
380 This shows that there is more inflammable material in Europe than we thought.
Lazzari praised our resolution on tactics.
It is an * See Vol.
24 of this edition, pp.

important achievement of our congress.
If Lazzari admits it, then the thousands of workers who back him are bound to come to us, and their leaders will not be able to scare them away from us.
“Il faut reculer, pour mieux sauter” (you have to step back to make a better jump).
This jump is inevitable, since the situation, objectively, is becoming insufferable.
So we are beginning to apply our new tactic.
We mustn’t get nervy, we cannot be late, rather we may start too early, and when you ask whether Russia will be able to hold out so long, we answer that we are now fighting a war with the petty bourgeoisie, with the peasantry, an economic war, which is much more dangerous for us than the last war.
But as Clausewitz said, the element of war is a danger and we have never been out of that danger for a moment.
I am sure that if we act more cautiously, if we make concessions in time, we shall win this war too, even if it lasts over three years.
Summing up: 1) All of us, unanimously throughout Europe, shall say that we are applying the new tactic, and in this way we shall win the masses.
2) Co-ordination of the offensive in the most important countries: Germany, Czechoslovakia, Italy.
We need here preparation, constant co-ordination.
Europe is pregnant with revolution, but it is impossible to make up a calendar of revolution beforehand.
We in Russia will hold out, not only five years, but more.
The only correct strategy is the one we have adopted.
I am confident that we shall win posi-tions for the revolution which the Entente will have nothing to put up against, and that will be the beginning of victory on a world scale.
2 "meral seemed to be pleased with my speech, but he inter-prets it one-sidedly.
I said in the committee that in order to find the correct line "meral had to make three steps to the left, and Kreibich one step to the right.
"meral, unfortu-nately, said nothing about taking these steps.
Nor did he say anything about his views on the situation.
Concerning thedifficulties, "meral merely repeated the old arguments and said nothing new.
"meral said that I had dispelled his fears.
In the spring he was afraid that the communist leader-ship would demand of him untimely action, but events dispelled these fears.
But what worries us now is this: will things really come to the stage of preparation for the offen-sive in Czechoslovakia, or will they be confined merely to talk about difficulties.
The Left mistake is simply a mistake, it isn’t big and is easily rectified.
But if the mistake pertains to the resolution to act, then this is by no means a small mistake, it is a betrayal.
These mistakes do not bear compar-ison.
The theory that we shall make a revolution, but only after others have acted first, is utterly fallacious.
3 The retreat made at this congress can, I think, be com-pared with our actions in 1917 in Russia, and therefore prove that this retreat must serve as preparation for the offensive.
Our opponents will say that we are not saying today what we said before.
It will do them little good, but the working-class masses will understand us if we tell them in what sense the March action is to be considered a success and why we criticise its mistakes and say that we should make better preparations in future.
I agree with Terracini when he says that the interpretations of "meral and Burian are wrong.
If co-ordination is to be understood as our having to wait until another country has started, a country that is richer and has a bigger population, then this is not a communist interpretation, but downright deception.
Co-ordination should consist in comrades from other countries knowing exactly what moments are significant.
The really important interpretation of co-ordination is this: the best and quickest imitation of a good example.
That of the workers of Rome is a good example.

1921 First published in 1 9 3 2 in Lenin Miscellany XX Lenin Printed from the manuscriptNOTES ON MEASURES FOR COMBATING FAMINE AND STEPPING UP ECONOMIC WORK 383 If an area affected by crop failure and famine embraces a territory with a population of twenty-five million, should we not, by a number of revolutionary measures, take young men into the army from this particular area to the number of about 500,000 (or even perhaps up to 1 million?).
Purpose: to help out the famine-stricken population to some extent, as we shall feed some of them and perhaps help others by means of parcels which the men will send home.
That is one thing.
Secondly: locate these half a million in the Ukraine, where they can help to step up food supply work, in which they are deeply concerned, keenly aware as they are of the injustice of the gluttony practised by the rich peasants in the Ukraine.
The harvest in the Ukraine is estimated roughly (Rakov-sky) at 550-650 million poods.
Deducting 150 million poods for sowing and 300 (15 8 20 = 300) for feeding the family and the farm animals, we get a balance (550 — 450 = 1 0 0; 650 — 450 = 2 0 0) at an average of about 1 5 0 million poods.
If we post an army from the famine-stricken gubernias in the Ukraine this balance (tax & barter & special requisi-tions from the rich to help the starving) could be collected in full.
Measures should immediately be stepped up in the famine-stricken gubernias to collect raw materials (hides, hoofs, horns, bristles, etc.
, etc.
) and it should be made a rule, incidentally, that not a pood of relief should be rendered either for seed or food unless payment is made in one or another form of raw materials or fallen wood fuel or similar stuff.
* To revive the work of the gubernia, uyezd and district economic conferences of Petrograd, Moscow, Ivanovo-Vozne-sensk and a few principal industrial centres not far from the two capital cities, could not 2-4 top-level workers of the * In the manuscript this paragraph has been crossed out by Lenin.

central departments be assigned to each of these economic conferences? These groups of, say, four people, could work together as a team, being selected from among the staff of one and the same central institution or being well acquainted with each other, and they could do regular work in these economic councils, say, an hour a day each, making 3-4 hours a day together? The complete or partial transfer of workers of the non-economic commissariats to economic work could be arranged in this way: their work at the commissariat could be shifted to the extent of three-fourths or nine-tenths to third-rate assistants, whom they could supervise.
In Moscow (and afterwards in other places) all top-level Party workers should be mobilised for economic work in this way: every top-level Party worker of a non-economic commis-sariat takes a low-level economic job, for which purpose he joins some factory committee (or house or block commit-tee)—no organisation higher than that (in order to work at low-level)—and undertakes to devote no less than two hours a day to this work.
Priority is to be given to the work of distributing foodstuffs, raising the level of the economic branch concerned, and fuel supply.
It is important that each worker’s assignment should be precisely defined.

ZINOVIEV AND INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SECRETARY Type 6 copies and send to P 1) Radek N 2) me 3) Trotsky M 4) Kamenev N 5) Stalin Q 6) extra copy To Comrade Zinoviev 13/VIII-1921 Obviously, we cannot properly organise in Russia a bureau for properly summarising and selecting information on the international labour movement.
We haven’t the people for it, nor the libraries, etc.
I suggest that such a bureau be set up in Germany.
Employ one manager (a non-work-fit Communist, better still a non-Communist) plus 2 assistants (& 2—3 typists).
A definite monthly sum should be earmarked for this purpose.
We should try to arrange legally, under some trade name, something like Zeitungskorrespondenz, a supply of articles and copy to the newspapers.
Three Germans (knowing English, French, Italian and Czech—enough to start with) could of course be found.
Radek, if I am not mistaken, even had someone in mind.
This bureau, if we could find efficient men to run it under contract (intellectuals in Germany are hard up, and we could select a good staff), would carry on systematic research work for us in collecting literary and special newspaper material and working it up on two cardinal and main points: A) international imperialism; B) the international labour movement.
We could (with Radek and with his help) probably find 2-3 dozen Communists doing journalistic work in all countries to act as contributors (and writer-consultants) to this bureau.
Such a bureau would work for a start in German (for the continent of Europe now undoubtedly the most international language); and at the first opportunity it would add to its publications translations into French and English.
Russian translations could easily be arranged: we would simply give the job through official state channels to 2-3 bourgeois pro-fessors, so as not to divert communist forces on purely technical work.
On both these questions (A and B) the bureau should systematically keep abreast of the international literature, especially newspaper literature, and compile lists of valuable books and newspaper articles on these questions.
The most important thing here would be to detail and arrange these questions correctly—to compile a rational and classified list of these questions and supplement it in good time according to the needs of the moment.
And then—commentaries of not more than 3-10 lines on books and on very rare and specially important newspaper articles (1 out of 100, or maybe 1 out of 500), so that you can tell at once what to look for and what the respective book or article deals with.
The writer-consultants could write these commentaries (or rather a statement of the contents) easily, if the German centre organised this work and paid them for it.
Further, the bureau should run a summary of important items of information from the newspapers and press-cuttings (at least 3-4 sets to begin with: one for the files, one for Moscow, and one extra set to meet any contingency).
With the help of consultants and Radek at their head, we could make up a list of subjects, for example: — — shadings and controversial issues within communism: —— and on the fringe of ” ” ” communism (II 2 * and anarchists); —— also within the trade ” ” ” union movement; —— elections and their statistics (or results) to judge the strength of the trends in the labour movement; —— the history of outstanding strikes and “incidents” (demonstrations, actions, etc.
) and so on.
I believe that, properly organised, this bureau would bring in a certain income, as its bulletins would be purchased by certain newspapers and libraries as important information material.
But this income, of course, would at best cover only a small part of the expenses.
We can and should bear these expenses.
All the material, as far as we are concerned, will serve the cause of public education and the work of propa-ganda and agitation.
Such a bureau can and should be organised.
It can be very useful.
Without it we have no eyes, ears or hands for par-ticipation in the international movement—and we do it casually always dependent (for information) on someone who is closer near at hand, who has happened to read about it, who has just dropped in, happened to mention it, and so on.
I propose that the Politbureau discuss this plan and set up a small commission for its preliminary drafting, say: Radek Trotsky &? * Meaning the Centrist II 2 International.
—Ed.
Perhaps only two would be better to start with.
They can enlist the co-operation of Steklov and Béla Kun (and many others), invite to Moscow a candidate for the post of bureau manager, and then be able to make up an estimate and submit the whole elaborated plan to the Politbureau for consideration.

VARGA AND THESES ON THE ORGANISATION OF AN INFORMATION INSTITUTE ON QUESTIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR MOVEMENT Dear Comrade Varga, I enclose my remarks.
If you think it necessary, we can talk things over on the telephone.
Best regards, Lenin 31/8 Tentative Amendments or Theses To Comrade E.
Varga’s Project for the Organisation of an Information Institute 1.
Absolute and strict legality of the Institute for Berlin or Vienna conditions and for the whole of Western Europe, Britain and America.
2.
Headquarters of the Institute—Berlin or Vienna or Copenhagen or Christiania.
3.
No more than 20% of the Institute’s working time and publications should be devoted to economic and social questions (both together 20%).
80% to political questions.
4.
As far as political questions are concerned, the task of the Institute is only to collect objective data on questions that are legal and open to discussion.
5.
The Institute must be completely independent of the respective Communist Parties.
6.
The official name of the Institute should be, tenta-tively: Institute for the Study of Forms of Social Movement.
7.
Instructions of a principle nature are to be given to the head (or to three heads, not more) of the Institute.
8.
On the basis of verbal instructions of a principle nature the head is to work out detailed and absolutely legal instructions and submit them here in Moscow for endorse-ment by the Comintern Executive.
9.
Reports to be submitted weekly or twice a week.
Socio-economic appendixes monthly or tri-monthly.
10.
The Institute must have no contacts whatever with the Russian embassies.
11.
The Institute must begin in a small way.
For the German-speaking countries, Scandinavia and the Slav countries—only the German language.
Activities may be extended to Anglo-Saxon and Romance countries only on the basis of a special agreement with a representative of each group of these countries.
Agreement only here in Moscow.
12.
The reports, or rather, publications, or correspondence of the Institute should be paid for by subscribers (newspapers libraries, etc.
).
The basic principle should be—such an organisation of the Institute and such operation as would compel all labour newspapers of all trends to subscribe to the Institute’s publications and pay for them.
If this does not happen, it will be proof that the Institute is worthless.
13.
Comrade Varga’s project 390 should serve as initial draft instructions.
In particular, two basic amendments to this project are needed: 1) § 3—up; 2) the political part should be considerably elaborated.
Some remarks to this Point 2: (Appendix B.
) §§3 and 4: Correspondence from factories? & money collected by the workers themselves? & questions of the trade union movement should be specially dealt with in detail from the political angle.
Winning the trade unions is one of the most important political issues.
& workers’ co-operatives: ditto (to Section II, b) & all transitional political formations (like the workers’ and farmers’ party in the United States) are especially important.
& Leaflets? Distribution? Circulation? & attitude to the 1914-18 war? Extremely important.
Section I I , § a “revolutionary” (??) workers’ parties like the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany.
Name is wrong.
They are not revolutionary.
They should be called: semi-anarchist, anarchist or near-anarchist.
It is necessary to add: a split of anarchism all over the world in patriotic and internationalist questions; for the Soviet system; against the Soviet system.
(§ b).
Parties of the II and II 2 Internationals—much more detailed.
& attitude to own colonies—and to imperialism in practical politics—much, much more detailed.
& all pacifist and petty-bourgeois-democratic groups and trends—much more detailed.
And so on.

VARGA Dear Comrade Varga, I consider it incorrect to put the question that way (supplying information to the Comintern Executive or to the labour press or to both?).
We need full and truthful information.
And the truth should not depend upon whom it has to serve.
We can accept only the division into unofficial infor-mation (for the Comintern Executive only) and official information (for everybody).
The former already exists and must exist separately; it must be improved.
The latter, to become good, requires good organisation in the selection of facts without a declaration that “we” are Communists.
If the selection of facts is full, exact and good, then the yellow labour press, too (especially the local and trade union newspapers) will certainly buy and pay for our material.
If that does not happen it will be evidence of our poor legal work.

KUIBYSHEV AND A DRAFT ENGAGEMENT FOR WORKERS GOING TO RUSSIA AMERICA 399 Comrade Kuibyshev, I am sending you the draft of an undertaking which Rutgers and all his people down to each individual worker have to give (in the event of an agreement being signed).
If you are agreeable, put it to them.
Find a reliable interpreter (for all negotiations) who knows both languages well.
An agreement is essential, and it must be very precisely worded.
We must get our own lawyer (a Communist) to draw it up.
I suggest it be called an agreement for handing over the management of a number of factories, etc.
The technical examination results should be signed by Stunkel and several other experts of repute.
With communist greetings, Lenin Do the leaders and organisers of the enterprise agree to sign the following engagement and obtain the signatures of all the other people going to Russia from America:1.
We undertake to see to it and collectively answer for it that only such people shall go to Russia as are capable and willing to face a number of severe hardships involved in the rehabilitation of industry in a very backward and utterly ruined country.
2.
Those going to Russia undertake to work their hardest and with the greatest efficiency and discipline exceeding those of capitalist standards, as otherwise Russia will not be able to outstrip capitalism or even catch up with it.
3.
We undertake, in the event of any conflicts whatsoever to submit them for settlement to the supreme Soviet authority of Russia and faithfully abide by its decisions.
4.
We undertake not to forget the extremely nervous state of the starving and exhausted Russian workers and peasants involved in our business and to render them every assistance with a view to establishing friendly relations and overcoming any distrust or envy.

This reform is to be carried out with the greatest care, no single step to be taken without practical verifica-tion that the business of beet cultivation is adequately provided for by a rational system of farming and by the peasant’s own personal interest in the matter.
2.
400,000 dessiatines to be allotted to the refineries, this figure to be checked as to whether it is really necessary for ensuring properly organised large-scale factory farming.
The refineries to be made responsible for all the land allotted to them being rationally cultivated and utilised for the plants.
3.
Compulsory crop rotation to be introduced on the peasant lands and obligatory norms of culture to be appliedto them only in those cases where beet crops have long been cultivated on these lands.
4.
Strict care should be taken that the relations between the sugar refineries and the beet-cultivating peasants are based on a really voluntary agreement within the limits of an obligatory fixed beet-sowing area.

(B.

X.
1921 Comrade Molotov, I enclose material on the Rutgers business.
It is for the Council of Labour and Defence to decide.
I suggest that it first be decided in the C.
C.
— it is a political question.
And the Politbureau must have its say, as it is a gold spending.
Please get the secretary to telephone all the members of the Politbureau who will each arrange for one hour in the course of which he will be able to familiarise himself with the material before Friday.
Each one must look through it so that it can be settled on Friday.
Let the secretary make up a time-table and send the material round to each member of the Politbureau.
A difficult question: for: if the Americans keep their word, it will be of tremendous benefit.
In that case we shall not grudge 600,000 gold rubles.
against: will they keep their word? Heywood is half-anarchist.
More sentimental than business-like.
Rutgers may succumb to Leftism.
Calvert is highly garrulous.
We have no business guarantees whatever.
Enthusiastic people, in an atmosphere of unemployment, may recruit a group of “adventurous spirits” who will end up in squabbles.
We may then lose part of our 600,000 gold rubles (they will, of course, spoil and waste some of the property) and risk losing up to 1 million gold rubles more, because under § 8 (the end of it) we undertake “to reimburse the equivalent of expenditures on machines and tools brought in by the said emigrant”.
No small risk.
For: Smirnov I.
N.
and Maximov (of the Urals) are local people, and they are for it.
Against: Martens should know the Americans well, and he is against.

X.
1921 Dear Comrades, Judging by the scrappy information concerning the growth of the communist movement in Poland that reaches our newspapers, and judging (still more) by the reports of some very prominent Polish comrades, the revolution in Poland is coming to a head.
A workers’ revolution is brewing: the complete collapse of the P.
P.
S.
* (in Russian—S.
R.
s and Mensheviks; in European—the II and II2 Internationals).
The trade unions, one after another, are joining the Communists.
The growth of demonstrations, and so on.
Imminent and inevitable financial collapse.
The gigantic failure of bour-geois democracy (and of the petty bourgeoisie) in Poland with the agrarian reform, a failure that is foredoomed, inevitable, and bound to push the majority of the rural population—the whole poor section of the peasantry—towards the Communists.
Financial collapse and shameless plunder of Poland by Entente capital (France and other countries) are bringing with them a practical exposure of national and Great Power illusions, an exposure that is strikingly clear and tangible to the masses, to the rank-and-file worker, to the rank-and-file peasant.
If this is so, then the revolution (Soviet revolution) in Poland is bound to win, and win soon.
That being the case, the Government and the bourgeoisie must be prevented from strangling the revolution by bloody suppression of a premature uprising.
You must not be provoked.
You must wait for the tide to rise to its highest: it will sweep everything away and give victory to the Communists.
If the bourgeoisie kills 100-300 people, this will not ruin the cause.
But if it is able to provoke a massacre, to kill 10-30 thousand workers, this may delay the revolution even for several years.
If it is important for the Government to hold elections to the Seim, then an effort should be made for the Seim to * P.
P.
S.
—the Polish Socialist Party.
—Ed.
be won by the wave of the workers’ revolution and the peasants’ discontent.
Do not yield to provocation.
The revolution must be allowed to grow to full ripening of the fruit.
The victory of Soviet power from within Poland will be a gigantic international victory.
If Soviet power has, in my opinion, now won an international victory to the extent of 20-30 per cent, then with the victory of Soviet power from within Poland, we shall have a 40-50, perhaps even 51 per cent international victory of the communist revolution.
For Poland is next door to Germany, Czecho-slovakia and Hungary, and a Soviet Poland will under-mine the whole regime built up on the peace of Versailles.
That is why the Polish Communists bear a responsibility before the whole world—that of keeping a firm grip on the helm of their ship and steering clear of provocations.
Is it worth while retaliating for the beating up of Dabå l by Daszynski & Co.
? Retaliation, if any, should be by beating up Daszynski, just like that, without any shooting or wounding.
It may be worth while if it has the effect of teaching an insolent fellow a lesson at the hands of the workers, and stiffening the workers’ spirit at the cost of a sacrifice of 5-10 of them (by imprisonment or execution).
But maybe it is not worth while: would not the fact that our Dåbal had been brutally beaten up be more useful for the purpose of agitation among the peasants? Would it not be more effective in turning the sympathy of the backward peasants towards us than the thrashing of Daszynski? This should be weighed more carefully.

P.
R.
’s geographical position the imperialist powers, in case of war, would try to seize our country and use it as a jumping-off ground for military operations against another country.
Therefore, Lenin said, the only right way for every working person in your country was to fight for state and economic independence in alliance with the workers and peasants of Soviet Russia.
This fight could not be carried on isolatedly, therefore the establishment of a party of Mongolian arats was a pledge of success in their struggle.
The Mongolian delegation’s second question: “Will the national liberation struggle be victorious?” Comrade Lenin’s answer: “I have been in the revolutionary movement myself for thirty years and I know by experience how difficult it is for any people to liberate themselves from their external and internal enslavers.
Although Mongolia is a cattle-breeding country and the bulk of her population are nomad herdsmen, she has achieved great progress in her revolution, and most important of all, has made good these successes by creating a People’s Revolutionary Party of her own, whose aim is to become a mass party uncluttered by alien elements.
” The Mongolian delegation’s third question: “Ought not the People’s Revolutionary Party be transformed into a Communist Party?”Comrade Lenin’s reply: “I should not recommend it, because one party cannot be ‘transformed’ into another.
” Comrade Lenin explained the essence of a Communist Party as a party of the prole-tariat, and said: “The revolutionaries will have to put in a good deal of work in developing state, economic and cultural activities before the herdsman elements become a proletarian mass, which may eventually help to ‘transform’ the People’s Revolutionary Party into a Communist Party.
A mere change of signboards is harmful and dangerous.
” Comrade Lenin elaborated on the idea that it was possible and necessary for the M.
P.
R.
to follow a non-capitalist path of development, the main condition for which was hard work on the part of the People’s Revolutionary Party and the Government, so that this work and the increased influence of the Party and the authorities would result in a growth of the number of co-operatives, in the intro-duction of new forms of economic activity and national culture, and would rally the arats behind the Party and the Government in the interests of the country’s economic and cultural development.
It was only from the islets of the new economic way of life created by the efforts of the Party and the Government that the new non-capitalist economic system of arat Mongolia would take shape.

1921 Comrade Molotov, Could you try to settle two questions in the Politbureau by telephone: 1) That Sokolnikov be appointed member of the Board of the People s Commissariat for Finance and member of the Finance Commission on condition that he remains Chairman of the Turkestan Bureau and is obliged to travel to Turkestan when necessary until things there have been fully put in order.
(If this does not get a majority, I shall have to put the matter for consideration to the whole Politbureau) 2) Today we rejected my motion offhand 428 and I agreed to withdraw it.
But I now see that I was too hasty and I renew it: That 1) Pyatakov; 2) Rukhimovich; 3) Bogdanov (or his deputy Smilga) be directed to submit to the Politbureau within two weeks a plan (or regulations or theses) of rela-tions between the gubernia economic conferences and the large enterprises located in the given gubernia and subordinated directly to the centre in Moscow.
429 [We ourselves cannot draft it.
It is a universal question All the commissariats will have to be questioned.
It must be worked up quickly.
Start with the Donets Gubernia Economic Conference.

is instituted on equal terms.
Tsyurupa is appointed to this post and released from the Food Commissariat.

(with the knowledge and consent of the commissars of the government departments concerned) on questions pertaining to the integration and direction of the economic com-missariats’ activities.
That is how I conceive the official decision of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee.
430 The task is to integrate and improve the economic work AS A WHOLE, especially in connection with and through the State Bank (trade) and the State Planning Commission.
To make a first-hand study of the specific features and work of all the economic commissariats and an acquaintance with all the members of their boards and a number (10-100) of local and regional top workers in this field.
To personally attend important board meetings of the respective commissariats, the State Planning Commission, the State Bank, Centrosoyuz, etc.
and check personally,at the choice of the Deputy Chairmen of the C.
L.
D.
, those functions which are considered most vital or of special topicality.
For how long these posts will be, “we shall see”: perhaps 3-4 years, perhaps 30 years.
One of the objects is to develop a highly trained type of instructor-inspector to check and organise all economic work at all economic institutions centrally and locally.
The deputy chairmen conduct their work through the apparatus of the existing commissariats, having only the Managing Department of the C.

The paragraph on the history of Bolshevism should be amplified and partly modified.
It is incorrect to say there was a split only in 1910.
It should be stated that the formal splits with the Mensheviks in the spring of 1905 and in January 1912 alternated with the semi-unity and unity of 1906 and 1907 followed by that of 1910 not only because of the vicissitudes of the struggle but also under pressure from the rank and file, who demanded check tests through their own experience.
I think this should be stated more explicitly and concretely on one page.

C.
P.
(B.
) ON THE PARTY PURGE With regard to Zalutsky’s draft resolution on the Party purge I would like to make two remarks.
1) In section 3 §a Zalutsky proposes that enrolment into the Party be suspended for 6 months.
I think this is wrong.
I would propose, on my part, not to suspend enrol-ment, but to lay down stricter conditions, namely: a long term of probation.
If an eighteen-month term for real workers is considered too long, it can be reduced, say, to nine, or even six months, as Trotsky proposes.
In the case of such short terms, however, I think we should require a qualifiedmajority in the bodies making enrolment decisions, for instance, that it should require a majority of not less than four-fifths to have the term of enrolment reduced, this four-fifths majority to be demanded not only from one Party body (the local cell making the admission), but from several bodies for the sake of mutual control (for example, from the Gubernia Party Committee in addition to the local cell, and so on).
I would have nothing whatever against admission into the Party being made easier for genuine workers, but unless very strict conditions are laid down for determining who is to be considered a worker of large industry, we shall immediately find a mass of riff-raff crawling through the hole again.
As regards Red Armymen, I think we should have stricter conditions, since, for one thing, most of them are not workers, but peasants, and secondly, these people are too young and need testing.
2) In Section 4 §a Zalutsky proposes a revision of the plans of work among the Young Communist League.
I believe stricter conditions should be laid down on this point to make sure that the members of the Y.
C.
L.
admitted to member-ship of the Party have, first, really studied seriously and learnt something, and secondly, that they have a long record of serious practical work (economic, cultural, etc.
).
437 Lenin Dictated over the telephone December 2 2 , 1 9 2 1 First published in 1 9 5 9 in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI Printed from the secretary notes (typed copy) SPEECHES AT A MEETING OF NON-PARTY DELEGATES TO THE NINTH ALL-RUSSIA CONGRESS OF SOVIETS DECEMBER 26, 1921 438 1 Comrades, having decided to continue our talk—I think we have no doubts on this score—I just want to say that it is now about half past eight and we can sit on till half past nine or even later.
We must pick a question which weare most interested in.
If, as one comrade said here, it is the agrarian question, then I say—let us distribute our time on those questions which are most important for you.
My business here, as I understand it, is mainly to listen and make notes.
What I wanted to tell you I have already told you at the congress.
I am trying to take down notes as to what gubernia, what uyezd the complaints come from and what most of them are about.
I think the time should be distributed in such a way that after the question of compulsory carting tax has been dealt with, we should figure out what questions seem most important so that delegates from different gubernias can have time to have their say on them.
My business here is to make as detailed notes as possible in order to know what the non-Party delegates have spoken about.
In any case, it will be very difficult for me to answer some of the questions that will be put here, as I have no information at hand and cannot give an immediate reply.
That is why I suggest choosing questions which are considered the most important and on which delegates will speak from the floor, the way the carting tax question has been raised, and I shall write down every statement made by local people.
Comrades, it is very difficult for me to say even a few words on this question, because all the questions that have been put here I am writing down with a note of what guber-nia they come from, but without exact information from the institution concerned I am unable straight off to answer 2 the questions that have been put here.
The comrade from the Commissariat for Labour who has just spoken, found it much easier because he has before his eyes a published law and an explanation of what mitigations the enforcement of that law will yield.
Without information from the commissariats concerned I can give no definite answers to some of the questions that have been put here.
A number of notes have been sent up.
One of them is from a Ukrainian comrade from Kiev, who asks why I have never visited the Ukraine.
It is a long journey to the Ukraine, and a difficult one to undertake.
One comrade asks, who is going to pay for the horses killed in the carting service.
I have made a note of that question.
The comrade has already answered in a general way.
Two notes have been handed up on the question of the tax in kind and about it being impossible for the needy peasant to buy textile goods.
Naturally, the peasants in all gubernias these days have many difficulties like these to bear.
Without information from the institution concerned I am unable to answer this sort of question just now.
Can we help and to what extent can we help? I repeat, that at the moment I can give no reply.
It seems to me that the most important thing that has been said here on the question of carting service is—as far as I can gather from a glance at my notes (and I have written down briefly what each of the comrades has said here)—the most impor-tant thing, to my mind, are the instances of abuse and irregularities on the part of the Zheleskoms.
439 Most of the complaints have been about the stints assigned by the Zheleskoms being heavy, about the hard time peasants are having, about there being far too many irregularities in the distribution and assignment of jobs, especially at a time when they are simply harmful to the peasants’ farm work.
I have made notes of all these remarks, and a note that when the last three-week campaign was held, all comrades from the centre were sent out to the local areas.
I asked for exact information on all irregularities connected with fuel work, and on all abuses, as well as a number of reports to be col-lected.
I have already begun to receive letters about this, but recently, owing to ill-health, which made me confine myself only to a general report at the congress, I have not been able to deal with these letters myself.
This will be entrusted to another comrade, who is temporarily taking my place, but we shall definitely collect all the information that has come in during the last three-week campaign.
The complaints about the irregularities and abuses of the Zheleskoms I consider, on the whole, undoubtedly correct.
One of the principal reasons why it was decided to introduce the carting tax which the comrade from the Labour Commissariat has spoken about here is that, unless the amount of work to be done is properly determined (this attempt is beingmade by the fixing of a six-day period of work in the law), unless this is properly determined in the law, abuses by the gubernia logging committees and the Zheleskoms are bound to take place and will be very difficult to combat.
But when the law definitely declares, as it now does, how many work days are required and there will be a known set task fixing how much work is to be done in the given number of days, the abuses will be much easier to combat.
Naturally, the fight against abuses by these bodies in the gubernias and uyezds is no easy job, especially when, as a comrade here pointed out, many of the old employees, the former land-owners and former timber contractors have wormed their way into these bodies.
A stricter eye must be kept on this in the local areas and we must have more comrades from among the non-Party peasants in the Central Executive Committee, who could be applied to in the event of a com-plaint failing to reach its destination, and who would raise the question at a sitting of the C.
E.
C.
and demand an investigation into the abuses.
These measures will be put through at this congress in any case.
The number of C.
E.
C.
members from among the non-Party peasants, as comrades taking part in the congress have told me, will definitely be increased.
By this means it will be possible to keep an eye on abuses by the Zheleskoms and easier to combat them when there will be more non-Party peasant members in the C.
E.
C.
I repeat, I am making a note of all the remarks that are made here and shall write to the appropriate com-missariat or economic council about each of them in order to have proper measures taken.
I cannot of course give a reply offhand to each particular question without getting the information from the commissariat concerned.
3 I have asked Comrade Kalinin for two minutes to clear up any misunderstanding that his words may have caused.
440 I am sure he did not intend to impute to me the idea that I ever suggested burning prayer-books.
Needless to say, I never suggested such a thing and never could.
You know that according to our Constitution, the fundamental lawof our Republic, freedom of conscience in respect of religion is fully guaranteed to every person.
Another word to the comrade who spoke about the very difficult situation in some of the uyezds of Vyatka Gubernia.
These uyezds are in the famine-stricken area.
Our main hope now will be in the agreement which the American Govern-ment has offered us.
We shall conclude it within the next few days.
Under this agreement the American Government offers twenty million dollars.
We shall give ten million, making thirty million dollars altogether—that is, sixty million gold rubles.
This is a sizable sum.
Most of the spring crop area, if not all of it, will be sown.
In addition we are sending men to Canada.
I think we shall be able to spend an extra sum from the gold fund to buy a little more seed.
The main problem now, of course, is the famine, the dearth of fodder.
The sowing of spring crops must be done as fully as possible.
Every effort in this direction will be made.

1921 considered the question of the role and functions of the trade unions under the New Economic Policy.
The plenum heard the reports of Comrades Rudzutak, Andreyev and Shlyapnikov (the planned report by Comrade Lutovinov was not made owing to failure to call the reporter out in time).
After an exchange of opinions it was decided to submit the original draft theses of Comrades Rudzutak and Andreyev to a committee of these two comrades with the addition of Lenin and to charge this committee with drafting theses for endorsement by the Politbureau.
(Several lines will be added to this after approval of the draft by the committee and then the Politbureau.
)DRAFT 1.
THE NEW ECONOMIC POLICY AND THE TRADE UNIONS The New Economic Policy introduces a number of important changes in the position of the proletariat and, consequently, in that of the trade unions.
These changes are due to the fact that in their entire policy of transition from capitalism to socialism the Communist Party and the Soviet govern-ment are now adopting special methods to implement this transition and in many respects are operating differently from the way they operated before: they are capturing a number of positions by a “new flanking movement”, so to speak; they are drawing back in order to make better prepara-tions for a new offensive against capitalism.
In particular, a free market and capitalism, both subject to state control, are now being permitted and are developing; on the other hand, the state enterprises are being put on what is called a profit basis, i.
e.
, they are in effect being largely re-organised on commercial and capitalist lines.
2.
STATE CAPITALISM IN THE PROLETARIAN STATE AND THE TRADE UNIONS The proletarian state may, without changing its own nature, permit freedom of trade and the development of capitalism only within certain bounds, and only on the condition that the state regulates (supervises, controls, determines the forms and methods of, etc.
) private trade and private capitalism.
The success of such regulation will depend not only on the state authorities, but also, and to a larger extent, on the degree of maturity of the prole-tariat and of the masses of the working people generally, on their cultural level, etc.
But even if this regulation is completely successful, the antagonism of class interests between labour and capital will certainly remain.
Conse-quently, one of the main tasks that will henceforth confront the trade unions is to protect in every way the class interests of the proletariat in its struggle against capital.
This task should be openly put in the forefront, and the machineryof the trade unions must be reorganised, modified or supple-mented accordingly; strike funds, and so on should be formed, or rather, built up.
3.
THE STATE ENTERPRISES THAT ARE BEING PUT ON A PROFIT BASIS AND THE TRADE UNIONS The conversion of state enterprises to what is called the profit basis is inevitably and inseparably connected with the New Economic Policy; in the near future this is bound to become the predominant, if not the sole, form of state enterprise.
Actually, this means that with the free market now permitted and developing, the state enterprises, will to a large extent be put on a commercial, capitalist basis.
This circumstance, in view of the urgent need to increase the productivity of labour and make every state enterprise pay its way and show a profit, and in view of the inevitable rise of narrow departmental interests and excessive depart-mental zeal, is bound to create a certain conflict of interests between the masses of workers and the directors and managers of the state enterprises, or the government departments in charge of them.
Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the trade unions, in regard to the state enterprises as well, to protect the class interests of the proletariat and the working masses against their employers.
4.
THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CLASS STRUGGLE OF THE PROLETARIAT IN A STATE WHICH RECOGNISES PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND, FACTORIES, ETC.
, AND WHERE POLITICAL POWER IS IN THE HANDS OF THE CAPITALIST CLASS, AND THE CLASS STRUGGLE OF THE PROLETARIAT IN A STATE WHICH DOES NOT RECOGNISE PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND AND THE MAJORITY OF THE LARGE ENTERPRISES AND WHERE POLITICAL POWER IS IN THE HANDS OF THE PROLETARIAT As long as classes exist, the class struggle is inevitable.
In the period of transition from capitalism to socialism the existence of classes is inevitable; and the Programme of theRussian Communist Party definitely states that we are taking only the first steps in the transition from capitalism to socialism.
Hence, the Communist Party, the Soviet government and the trade unions must frankly admit the existence of a class struggle and its inevitability until the electrification of industry and agriculture is completed— at least in the main—and until small production and the supremacy of the market are thereby cut off at the roots.
It follows from this that at the present moment we can under no circumstances abandon the idea of the strike struggle, we cannot, as a matter of principle, conceive the possibility of a law that makes compulsory state mediation take the place of strikes.
On the other hand, it is obvious that under capitalism the ultimate object of the strike struggle is to break up the state machine and to overthrow the given class state power.
Under the transitional type of proletarian state such as ours, however, the ultimate object of the strike struggle can only be to fortify the proletarian state and the state power of the proletarian class by combating the bureaucratic distortions, mistakes and flaws in this state, and by curbing the class appetites of the capitalists who try to evade its control, etc.
Hence, the Communist Party, the Soviet government and the trade unions must never forget and must never conceal from the workers and the mass of the working people that the strike struggle in a state where the prole-tariat holds political power can be explained and justified only by the bureaucratic distortions of the proletarian state and by all sorts of survivals of the old capitalist system in the government offices on the one hand, and by the political immaturity and cultural backwardness of the mass of the working people on the other.
When the law courts and all other organs of the state are built on a class basis, by the working people themselves, with the bourgeoisie excluded from the electorate, the normal method of settling conflicts between labour and capital, between employed and employers, will more and more often find expression in the working people turning directly to the state authorities.
5.
REVERSION TO VOLUNTARY TRADE UNION MEMBERSHIP The compulsory wholesale signing up of all workers for membership in the trade unions is no longer consistent with the present degree of socialisation achieved in industry or with the level of development of the masses.
Compulsory membership has moreover introduced a certain degree of bureaucratic distortion into the trade unions themselves.
It is absolutely essential to revert for a fairly considerable length of time to the practice of voluntary membership in the trade unions.
Under no circumstances must trade union members be required to subscribe to any specific political views; in this respect, as well as in respect of religion, the trade unions must be non-partisan.
All that must be required of trade union members in the proletarian state is that they should understand comradely discipline and the necessity of uniting the workers’ forces for the pur-pose of protecting the interests of the working people, and that they should keep faith with the working people’s government, i.
e.
, the Soviet government.
The proletarian state must encourage the workers to organise in trade unions both for legal and material reasons; but the trade unions can have no rights without duties.
6.
THE TRADE UNIONS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY Following its seizure of political power, the principal and fundamental interest of the proletariat lies in securing an increase in output, an enormous increase in the productive forces of society.
This task, which is clearly formulated in the Programme of the Russian Communist Party, is particularly urgent in our country today owing to post-war ruin, famine and economic dislocation.
Hence, the speediest and most enduring success in restoring large-scale industry is a condition without which no success can be achieved in the general cause of emancipating labour from the yoke of capital and securing the victory of socialism.
To achievethis success in Russia, in the conditions at present obtaining in that country, it is absolutely essential that all authority in the factories be concentrated in the hands of the manage-ment.
The factory management, usually built up on the principle of one-man responsibility, must have authority independently to fix and pay out wages, and also distribute rations, working clothes, and all other supplies; it must enjoy the utmost freedom to manoeuvre, exercise strict control of the actual successes achieved in increasing production, in making the factory pay its way and show a profit, and carefully select the most talented and capable administrative personnel, etc.
Under these circumstances, any direct interference by the trade unions in the management of the factories must be regarded as positively harmful and impermissible.
It would be absolutely wrong, however, to interpret this indisputable axiom to mean that the trade unions must play no part in the socialist organisation of industry and in the management of state industry.
Their participation in this is necessary in the following strictly defined forms.
7.
THE ROLE AND FUNCTIONS OF THE TRADE UNIONS IN THE BUSINESS AND ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANISATIONS OF THE PROLETARIAN STATE The proletariat is the class foundation of the state making the transition from capitalism to socialism.
In a country where the small peasantry is overwhelmingly predominant the proletariat can successfully fulfil this function if it very skilfully, cautiously and gradually establishes an alliance with the vast majority of the peasantry.
The trade unions must collaborate closely and constantly with the government, all the political and economic activities of which are guided by the class-conscious vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party.
Being a school of communism in general, the trade unions must, in particular, be a school for training the whole mass of workers, and eventually all working people, in the art of managing socialist industry (and gradually also agriculture).
Proceeding from these principles, the trade unions’ part in the activities connected with the business and administra-tive organisations of the proletarian state should take the following main forms: (1) The trade unions should help staff all the business and administrative bodies connected with economics by nominating their candidates for them and casting a consultative vote; the trade unions take part in these bodies too, not directly, but through the members of the higher state bodies, the members of business boards, members of the factory managements (where collegiate management is practised), managers, their assistants, etc.
, nominated by them and endorsed by the Communist Party and the Soviet government.
(2) One of the most important functions of the trade unions is to promote and train factory managers from among the workers and the masses of the working people generally.
At the present time we have scores of such factory managers who are quite satisfactory, and hundreds who are more or less satisfactory, but very soon, however, we must have hundreds of the former and thousands of the latter.
The trade unions must much more carefully and persistently than hitherto keep a systematic register of all workers and peasants capable of holding posts of this kind, and thoroughly, efficiently and from every aspect verify the progress they make in learning the art of management.
(3) No less important is the participation of the trade unions in all the planning bodies of the proletarian state.
In addition to participating in all cultural and educational activities and in production propaganda, the trade unions must also, on an increasing scale, enlist the working class and the masses of the working people generally for all branches of the work of building up the state economy; they must make them familiar with all aspects of economic life and with all details of industrial operations—from the procurement of raw materials to the marketing of the product; give them a more and more concrete understanding of the single state plan of socialist economy and the worker’s and peasant’s practical interest in its implementation.
(4) The drawing up of wage rates and scales of sup-plies, etc.
, is one of the essential functions of the trade unions in the building of socialism and in their partici-pation in the management of industry.
In particular, disciplinary courts should steadily improve labour discipline and proper ways of promoting it and achieving increased productivity; but they must not interfere with the functions of the People’s Courts in general or with the functions of factory managements.
This list of the major functions of the trade unions in the work of building up socialist economy, should, of course, be drawn up in greater detail by the competent trade union and government bodies.
The most important thing is that the trade unions should consciously and resolutely avoid direct, inexpert, incompetent and irresponsible interference in administrative matters, which has caused no little harm, and should start persistent, practical activities calculated to extend over a long period of years and designed to give the workers and all the working people generally practical training in the art of managing the economy of the whole country.
8.
CONTACT WITH THE MASSES— THE FUNDAMENTAL CONDITION FOR ALL TRADE UNION ACTIVITY Contact with the masses, i.
e.
, with the overwhelming majority of the workers (and eventually of all the working people), is the most important and most fundamental condition for the success of all trade union activity.
In all the trade union organisations and their machinery, from bottom up, there should be instituted, and tested in practice over a period of many years, a system of responsible com-rades—who must not all be Communists—who should live right among the workers, study their lives in every detail, and be able unerringly, on any question, and at any time, to judge the mood, the real needs, aspirations, and thoughts of the masses.
They must be able without a shadow of false idealisation to define the degree of their class-consciousness and the extent to which they are influenced by various pre-judices and survivals of the past; and they must be ableto win the boundless confidence of the masses by a comradely attitude and concern for their needs.
One of the greatest and most serious dangers that confront the numerically small Communist Party, which, as the vanguard of the working class, is guiding a vast country in the process of transition to socialism (for the time being without the direct support of the more advanced countries), is isolation from the masses, the danger that the vanguard may run too far ahead and fail to “straighten out the line”, fail to maintain firm contact with the whole army of labour, i.
e.
, with the overwhelming majority of workers and peas-ants.
Just as the very best factory, with the very best motors and first-class machines, will be forced to remain idle if the transmission-belts from the motors to the machines are damaged, so our work of socialist construction must meet with inevitable disaster if the trade unions—the transmission belts from the Communist Party to the masses— are badly fitted or function badly.
It is not sufficient to explain, to reiterate and corroborate this truth; it must be backed up organisationally by the whole structure of the trade unions and by their everyday activities.
9.
THE CONTRADICTIONS IN THE STATUS OF THE TRADE UNIONS UNDER THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT From all the foregoing it is evident that there are a number of contradictions in the various functions of the trade unions.
On the one hand, their principal method of operation is that of persuasion and education; on the other hand, as partici-pants in the exercise of state power they cannot refuse to share in coercion.
On the one hand, their main function is to protect the interests of the masses of the working people in the most direct and immediate sense of the term; on the other hand, as participants in the exercise of state power and builders of the economy as a whole they cannot refuse to resort to pressure.
On the one hand, they must operate in military fashion, for the dictatorship of the proletariat is the fiercest, most dogged and most desperate class war; on the other hand, specifically military methods of operationare least of all applicable to the trade unions.
On the one hand; they must be able to adapt themselves to the masses, to their level; on the other hand, they must never pander to the prejudices and backwardness of the masses, but steadily raise them to a higher and higher level, etc.
, etc.
These contradictions are no accident, and they will persist for several decades.
For one thing, these contradictions are inherent in every school.
And the trade unions are a school of communism.
We cannot count, until the lapse of several decades, on the majority of the workers achieving the highest level of development and discarding all traces and memories of the “school” for adults.
Secondly, as long as survivals of capitalism and small production remain, contra-dictions between them and the young shoots of socialism are inevitable throughout the social system.
Two practical conclusions must be drawn from this.
First, for the successful conduct of trade union activities it is not enough to understand their functions correctly, it is not enough to organise them properly.
In addition, special tact is required, ability to approach the masses in a special way in each individual case for the purpose of raising these masses to a higher cultural, economic and political stage with the minimum of friction.
Second, the aforementioned contradictions will inevitably give rise to disputes, disagreements, friction, etc.
A higher body is required with sufficient authority to settle these at once.
This higher body is the Communist Party and the international federation of the Communist Parties of all countries—the Communist International.
10.
THE TRADE UNIONS AND THE SPECIALISTS The main principles on this question are set forth in the Programme of the Russian Communist Party; but these will remain paper principles unless constant attention is paid to the facts which indicate the degree to which they are put into practice.
Recent facts of this kind are: first, cases of the murder of engineers by workers in socialised mines not only in the Urals, but also in the Donets Basin;second, the suicide of V.
V.
Oldenborger, chief engineer of the Moscow Waterworks.
* The Communist Party and the Soviet government as a whole bear a far greater share of the blame for cases of this kind than the trade unions.
It is not a question now of establishing the degree of political guilt, but of drawing certain political conclusions.
Unless our leading bodies, i.
e.
, the Communist Party, the Soviet government and the trade unions, guard as the apple of their eye every specialist who does his work conscientiously and knows and loves it—even though the ideas of communism are totally alien to him— it will be useless to expect any serious progress in socialist construction.
We may not be able to achieve it soon, but we must at all costs achieve a situation in which special-ists—as a separate social stratum, which will persist until we have reached the highest stage of development of commu-nist society—can enjoy better conditions of life under socialism than they enjoyed under capitalism insofar as concerns their material and legal status, comradely col-laboration with the workers and peasants, and in the intel-lectual plane, i.
e.
, finding satisfaction in their work, realising that it is socially useful and independent of the sordid interests of the capitalist class.
Nobody will regard a govern-ment department as being tolerably well organised if it does not take systematic measures to provide for all the needs of the specialists, to reward the best of them, to safeguard and protect their interests, etc.
, and does not secure practical results in this.
The trade unions must conduct all the activities of the type indicated (or system-atically collaborate in the activities of all the government departments concerned) not from the point of view of the interests of the given department, but from the point of view of the interests of labour and of the economy as a whole.
With regard to the specialists, on the trade unions devolves the very arduous duty of daily exercising influence on the broad masses of the working people in order to create proper relations between them and the specialists.
Only such activities can produce really important practical results.

THE TRADE UNIONS AND PETTY-BOURGEOIS INFLUENCES ON THE WORKING CLASS Trade unions are really effective only when they unite very broad strata of the non-Party workers.
This must give rise—particularly in a country in which the peasantry largely predominates—to relative stability, specifically among the trade unions, of those political influences that serve as the superstructure over the remnants of capitalism and over small production.
These influences are petty-bourgeois, i.
e.
, Socialist-Revolutionary and Menshevik (the Russian variety of the parties of the II and II 2 Inter-nationals) on the one hand, and anarchist on the other.
Only among these trends has any considerable number of people remained who defend capitalism ideologically and not from selfish class motives, and continue to believe in the non-class nature of the “democracy”, “equality” and “liberty” in general that they preach.
It is to this socio-economic cause and not to the role of individual groups, still less of individual persons, that we must attribute the survivals (sometimes even the revival) in our country of such petty-bourgeois ideas among the trade unions.
The Communist Party, the Soviet bodies that conduct cultural and educational activities and all Communist members of trade unions must therefore devote far more attention to the ideological struggle against petty-bourgeois influences, trends and deviations among the trade unions, especially because the New Economic Policy is bound to lead to a certain strengthening of capitalism.
It is urgently necessary to counteract this by intensifying the struggle against petty-bourgeois influences upon the working class.
The End Discuss together with the theses.
Give this to Comrade Molotov without rewriting.
This is the end of the publishable theses; i.
e.
, the draft of them that is being submitted to the commission and then the Politbureau.
I suggest that the resolution contained in Comrade Rudzutak’s draft be adopted by a special decision of the Politbureau in the following wording: The Politbureau directs the Orgbureau to set up under the Orgbureau of the Central Committee a special commission to check and replace some of the leading officials (and if possible all com-Not for munist functionaries) in the trade union move-publica-ment for the purpose of intensifying the struggle tion against petty-bourgeois, S.

A definite proportion should be fixed for every film-showing programme: a) entertainment films, specially for advertisement or income (of course, without obscenity and counter-revolution) and b) under the heading “From the life of peoples of all countries”—pictures with a special propaganda message, such as: Britain’s colonial policy in India, the work of the League of Nations, the starving Berliners, etc.
, etc.
Besides films, photographs of propaganda interest should be shown with appropriate subtitles.
The privately owned cinemas should be made to yield a sufficient return to the state in the form of rent, the owners to be allowed to increase the number of films and present new ones subject to censor-ship by the Commissariat for Education and provided the proper proportion is maintained between entertainment films and propaganda films coming under the heading of films “From the life of peoples of all countries”, in order that film-makers should have an incentive for producing new pictures.
They should be allowed wide initiative within these limits.
Pictures of a propaganda and educative nature should be checked by old Marxists and writers, to avoid a repetition of the many sad instances when propagandawith us defeated its own purpose.
Special attention should be given to organising film showings in the villages and in the East, where they are novelties and where our propaganda, therefore, will be all the more effective.

II.
1922 To Comrade Molotov for members of the Politbureau I propose that the following directives to the deputy chairman and all members of the Genoa delegation be endorsed: 1.
All members of the delegation should be posted in a general way on all political and financial questions that are likely to be brought up at the conference.
Moreover, every member of the delegation should make a special and thorough study of one of the most important diplomatic and one of the most important financial questions.
Chicherin and Litvinov are to be charged with drawing up an assignment of these questions among all the membersof the delegation (with the exception of sick members like Rudzutak, etc.
).
2.
Every member of the delegation must prepare for the meeting on 22.
II (with the Politbureau of the C.
C.
) the briefest (maximum 2-3 pages telegraphic style) of summaries of his programme of views and policies on all cardinal questions, both diplomatic and financial.
3.
Chicherin and Litvinov are to see to it that the appropriate literature in different languages is collected and handed out to the members of the delegation together with a systematic collection of documents in the Russian language.
4.
In view of the special importance and special diffi-culty of financial questions, Chicherin and Litvinov, by arrangement with the People’s Commissariat for Finance, the State Planning Commission and A.
D.
Tsyurupa, are to draw up a list of financial experts and a plan of work distribution among them; this to be done within 1 week.
5.
All members of the delegation must be perfectly familiar with Keynes’s book (The Economic Consequences of the Peace) and with similar bourgeois and bourgeois-pacifist books and parts of books (Lansing on the “imperialist” nature of the war and the peace of 1918, and so on).
Preparations should be on these lines: speeches and statements should give the communist point of view in a nutshell, set forth in such a way as to intimate that although we are Communists and hold such-and-such communist views we wish to cite non-Communists to this audience and to pose the question of annulling all debts and so forth from the bourgeois standpoint (see 6 and 7).
6.
All speeches and statements by our delegates at the conference should be calculated in advance in such a way that whatever the course or the outcome of the conference (even in the event of its speedy failure, which we, of course, should try to prevent), there would be, as a result, a brief but clear statement of the sum total of communist views (on questions of international relations and economics) and a detailed statement of bourgeois and bourgeois pacifist views on the irreconcilable contradictions of the imperialist world (and the imperialist peace).
7.
It is highly probable, almost certain, that all the bourgeois delegates at the conference will immediately form a silent but strong bloc for attacking us on account of Georgia and with all the usual accusations of petty-bourgeois and big bourgeois diplomacy and democracy.
We should be prepared for this in advance and make sure that we are the first to attack (apart from our main object of dividing the different countries and setting them by the ears).
The initiative in taking the offensive should be done mostly in a veiled form, for example by “hinting” (or by bourgeois quotations from relevant works) at the most painful and shameful points of imperialist relations (Korea; Amritsar; public flogging of revolutionaries in India; Lloyd George’s speech against Briand at Cannes concerning “assassinations” and so on and so forth).
8.
In view of the repeatedly proven desire on the part of our specialists in general and the Menshevik-minded ones in particular to fool us (very often successfully) by turning their foreign trips into a holiday and a means of strengthening whiteguard ties, the Central Committee proposes to limit ourselves in this case to an absolute minimum of fully reliable experts, each of whom is to present a guarantee in writing from the People’s Commissar concerned and from several Communists.
Forty-five is the top limit.
The list of experts and of all members to be sub-mitted for approval to the C.
C.
within 1 2 weeks.
This § to be taken charge of by Comrades Litvinov, Joffe and Chicherin.
They are also to choose a business manager who will not permit night work and such-like scandalous practices.
I move the following addendum to the draft theses of directives for the Genoa delegation: 9.
Our delegates should cite § 1 of the Cannes terms in their speeches and statements as often as possible, this citing to be done, first, exclusively in the wording of Petit Parisien, i.
e.
, using the words “system of property” and not just “system”; secondly, these words and this § to be given an extended meaning as if implying recognition of the inevitability of the capitalist system of property being replaced by the communist system of property, as if the only point at issue “between us” now remains the question of when this replacement will be effected and inwhat manner, i.
e.
, by the Russian method of 1917-20 or by the Lloyd George method of “truncated revolution” of the 1921 Irish type or the 1922 Egyptian type.

ZINOVIEV To Comrades Bukharin and Zinoviev We must consider beforehand what people, preferably those with a ready tongue, are going to represent the Comin-tern at the conference with the II and II 2 Internationals.
451 We must also consider beforehand the basic questions of tactics and strategy to be employed at this meeting.
The list of questions to be dealt with at the meeting.
should be considered beforehand and drawn up in agreement with each of the parties attending the meeting.
On our part we should include in this list only questions that have a direct bearing on practical joint action by the working masses and touching on matters that are recognised as indisputable in the official press statement of each of the three participants.
We must explain at length the reasons why we confine ourselves to such questions in the interests of a united front.
In the event of the yellow-fraternity raising mooted questions of policy, such as our attitude to the Mensheviks, the question of Georgia, etc.
, we should adopt these tactics: 1) declare that the list of questions can be drawn up only by a unanimous decision of all three participants; 2) declare that in drawing up our list of questions we were guided exclusively by the desire for unity of action by the working masses, which unity could be achieved immediately even under existing deep-seated political differences; 3) declare that we fully agree to questions such as our attitude to the Mensheviks, the question of Georgia and any other questions being raised by the II and II 2 Internationals, provided that theyagree to the following questions being raised: 1) the renegade attitude of the II and II 2 Internationals to the Basle Manifesto; 2) complicity of these same parties in the murder of Luxemburg, Liebknecht and other Communists of Germany through the bourgeois governments which those parties support; 3) a similar attitude of these parties to the murder of revolutionaries in the colonies by the bourgeois parties which the II and II 2 Internationals support, etc.
, etc.
We should prepare a list of these and similar questions beforehand and also prepare beforehand theses and speakers on various important questions of this nature.
We must find occasion to declare officially that we regard the II and II 2 Internationals only as inconsistent and vacillating participants of a bloc with the counter-revolutionary world bourgeoisie, and that we agree to attend a meeting on the united front for the sake of achieving possible practical unity of direct action on the part of the masses and in order to expose the political error of the II and II 2 Internationals’ entire position, just as the latter (the II and II 2 Internationals) have agreed to attend a meeting with us for the sake of achieving practical unity of direct action by the masses and in order to expose the political error of our position.

3.
That every person who wishes to go as an expert from Russia or who has been nominated for this post be made within 10 days to prepare an article dealing in detail with Russia’s relations with foreign countries in his selected field.
Those articles (or such parts of them) which contain no confidential matter should immediately be published in our press.

When the guilty party has been ascertained, I propose that the ROSTA * manager of that department be severely reprimanded and the journalist directly responsible should be dismissed, for only a perfect fool or a whiteguard could use our newspapers for advertising such a scoundrel as Parvus.

C.
directives: Without endorsing the list of experts, the C.
C.
directs the candidates nominated in it to submit within a week a précis of programme and tactics (on questions that come within the terms of reference of the given expert) for the whole Genoa Conference.
All People’s Commissars are obliged within 2 days to give written testimonials and guarantees for their candidates nominated as experts.
Should the experts disgrace themselves in Europe they and the People’s Commissars will be held responsible.
In furtherance of the directives concerning the Genoa Conference I propose the following: 1.
Without pre-determining in what form and at what time the speeches of our delegation should be made, the C.
C.
considers that the delegation is definitely obliged to develop a full, independent and integral programme on all cardinal issues.
2.
This programme should be a bourgeois-pacifist pro-gramme with the reservation, timely and clearly expressedby our delegation, that we do not put forward here a commu-nist programme—the only one that is in keeping with our views—(set it forth briefly) because we wish to put before the other delegations, who hold fundamentally different views, a number of palliatives and measures of a reformist type which have already been proposed in parts in Britain and other capitalist countries by people who share bourgeois views.
Under certain conditions this programme of pallia-tives could serve to mitigate the present difficult situation (the only real way out of which is possible given a final break with all the principles of capitalist property).
3.
A tentative list of the main points of this programme: (1) annulment of all debts; (2) application of the “Irish” solution to all colonies and dependent countries and nations; (3) radical revision of the Versailles Treaty; (4) the granting of loans on favourable terms to the countries most ruined by the war and too weak to recover their own feet, while being most important for world economy as eventual suppliers of vast quantities of food and raw materials; (5) establishment of a unified international gold unit for the currency systems of a number of countries and measures to introduce this unit; (6) an agreement among a number of countries on measures to combat inflation and depreciation of money (enumerate some of these measures); (7) agreement among a number of countries on measures for coping with the fuel crisis and on measures for the most rational and economical use of power resources on the basis of unified planned electrification; (8) the same in regard to the most urgent measures for reorganising and improving international transport to handle deliveries of raw materials and food.
And so on.
4.
Such a programme should be elaborated in speeches, and if this is impossible, printed in 3-4 European languages and handed out to the delegates and the press (if only in the form of a précis).
(In any case it should be printed.
) 5.
Only such people should be admitted as experts who are capable of developing, and making out a case for sucha programme (in one or another part of it) and who have proved this capability.
The experts will have to have their programmes and plans printed for Europe over their own signatures.
((Such a programme will evoke comment in the press of the Third International, whose articles will say: this attempt “to convince” will do no harm, but practically it is useless, because what is needed is a revolution; and in the press of the II and II 2 Internationals—we shall see what they have to say.

Now as regards the newspaper Kooperativnoye Dyelo.
1) The Board of Centrosoyuz, which consists only of Communists, says that the newspaper is necessary if the co-operatives are to fulfil their difficult and new organising work and carry out the trade tasks imposed upon them.
2) The paper’s editorial board consists only of Com -munists: I, Sarabyanov, Shvetsov, Kutuzov-Ilimsky, etc.
3) A delegation of Western co-operators is coming to Russia.
The closing of the newspaper will be taken ad -vantage of by the old co-operators and will make co-operative work difficult.
4) The closing of the newspaper will be exploited at the Genoa Conference.
5) So far there has been nothing hostile to Soviet power or communism in the paper.

) WITH REMARKS TO THE DRAFT RESOLUTION FOR THE FIRST EXTENDED PLENARY MEETING OF THE COMINTERN EXECUTIVE ON PARTICIPATION IN A CONFERENCE OF THE THREE INTERNATIONALS 456 To Comrade Molotov (for members of the Politbureau) I move the following amendments to the draft resolution sent in by Zinoviev concerning the Comintern’s participa-tion in the planned conference of all the workers’ parties of the world.
After the words: “unity of action among the working class masses which could be achieved immediately, despite fundamental political differences,” the phrases following this should be deleted up to the words: “that the working-class masses demand unity of action”.
The phrase beginning with these last words should be recast as follows: “the class-conscious workers, who are perfectly well aware of these political differences, nevertheless, together with the vast majority of the workers, desire and demand unity of action on practical issues most urgent and close to the interests of the workers.
There can be no doubt about this now in the mind of any conscientious person” and so on.
My second amendment is that the phrase beginning with the words: “all controversial issues to be avoided and questions that are not open to argument to be brought into focus” should be amended as follows: “and while postponing for a time the more controversial questions and bringing into focus the less controversial, both sides, or rather all three international organisations taking part in the conference, will naturally count on the ultimate victory of their points of view.
” My chief amendment is aimed at deleting the passage which calls the leaders of the II and II 2 Internationals accomplices of the world bourgeoisie.
You might as well call a man a “jackass”.
It is absolutely unreasonable torisk wrecking an affair of tremendous practical importance for the sake of giving oneself the extra pleasure of scolding scoundrels, whom we shall be scolding a thousand times at another place and time.
If there are still people at the enlarged meeting of the Executive who have not grasped the fact that the tactic of the united front will help us to overthrow the leaders of the II and II 2 Internationals, these people should have an extra number of popular lectures and talks read to them.
It may be necessary to have a special-ly popular pamphlet written for them and published in French, say, if the Frenchmen have not yet grasped Marxist tactics.
Finally, it were better to adopt this resolution, not unanimously, but by a majority (those who voted against we would afterwards put through a special, thorough and popular course of enlightenment) than run the risk of spoil-ing a practical affair for the sake of a few political youngsters who tomorrow will be cured of their infantile disorder.

C.

C.
P.
(B.
) ON THE TASKS OF THE SOVIET DELEGATION AT GENOA Only for circulation among members of the Politbureau Draft decision for the C.
C.
1.
The C.
C.
recognises as correct the appraisal of the situation and the tasks (of our delegation at Genoa) as given in the theses of Comrade Litvinov.
2.
The C.
C.
fully empowers Vice Chairman Chicherin to act as chairman of the delegation.
3.
In the event of Comrade Chicherin’s illness or departure his powers shall be vested in turn in one of the two trios:a) Litvinov, Krasin, Rakovsky; b) Litvinov, Joffe, Vorovsky.
4.
Our delegation should try to evade the question of acceptance of the Cannes terms.
Failing this, and in the event of our being presented with a direct ultimatum, we should try to work Krasin’s formula: “All countries recognise their state debts and undertake to compensate damage and losses caused by the acts of their governments.
” If this does not work either, we should make for a break, declaring definitely that we are prepared to recognise private debts, but that, not wishing to play hide-and-seek, we point out that we consider them covered, together with the whole sum of our obligations, by our counter-claims.
We accept no chief umpire between us and all the bourgeois countries, since the dispute is between two systems of property.
If we have to break, we should make it perfectly clear that the main and sole reason for the break is the greed of a handful of private capitalists, Urquhart, etc.
, whom the governments serve.
As a maximum concession these capitalists can be offered: a preferential right to concessions (i.
e.
, if we grant X a concession on their former property wholly or in part on such-and-such terms, we undertake to give it to its former owner on the same terms).
5.
In view of the possibility of the bourgeois trying to prevent us from developing our programme, we should make every effort in the very first speech to set forth, if not develop, this programme, or at least outline it (and immediately publish it in greater detail).
6.
In our programme we should, without concealing our communist views, confine ourselves to a brief and passing mention of them (for instance, in a subordinate clause), and to a forthright statement to the effect that we do not consider this the right place to preach our views, since we have come for trade agreements and for an attempt to reach an agreement with the pacifist section of the other (bourgeois) camp.
By the pacifist section of that camp (or some other well-chosen polite expression) we should make it clear that we mean the petty-bourgeois, pacifist and semi-pacifistdemocrats of the II and II 2 International type, and the Keynes type, etc.
One of our main, if not principal, political tasks at Genoa is to single out this wing of the bourgeois camp from the rest of the camp, try to flatter that wing, make it known that we consider possible and desirable not only a trade, but a political agreement with them (as one of the few chances of capitalism’s peaceful evolution towards the new order, which we, Communists, do not greatly believe in, but which we agree and consider our duty to help try out, as representatives of one power in face of a hostile majority of other powers).
Everything possible and even impossible should be done to strengthen the pacifist wing of the bourgeoisie and increase if only slightly its chances of success at the elections.
This first and foremost.
Secondly, to disunite the bourgeois countries that will be united against us at Genoa—such is our dual political task at Genoa, and not at all the development of communist views.
7.
Every attempt should be made to develop at length and publicise as widely as possible (in print, if not in speeches) the plan for the rehabilitation of the national economy in Russia and in Europe—in the spirit of the State Planning Commission’s researches and on the basis of these researches.
8.
If the bourgeois camp in Genoa presents an ultimatum to us not to touch on questions of pacifism, but to speak only on narrow trade subjects, we should express our regret, but comply with this ultimatum, saying that we had two aims at this conference—a pacifist aim and a trade aim.
This will leave only one.
9.
The C.
C.
leaves it to the delegation to elaborate the pacifist programme, confining itself to the general directive that they should try to develop it as broadly as possible in order to split the pacifist camp of the interna-tional bourgeoisie away from the gross-bourgeois, aggressive-bourgeois, reactionary-bourgeois camp.
10.
On the question of trade and concessions (including the question of loans), the forests of the North, etc.
, should be put forward as the principal guarantee.
We agree to no derogation of the rights of our state.
No agreementsare to be signed without the special consent, by telegraph, of the Central Committee.

That Comrade Divilkovsky’s proposal be adopted.

That the Moscow Committee be severely reprimanded for being indulgent to Communists (the form of indulgence —a special commission).

That it be confirmed to all Gubernia Party Committees that for the slightest attempt to “influence” the courts in the sense of “mitigating” the responsibility of Communists, the C.

GORBUNOV AND PROPOSALS ON THE QUESTION OF THE CO-OPERATIVES 464 Comrade Gorbunov, Read this, make a note of it for yourself and forward it immediately to Comrade Molotov for the members of the Politbureau, then for Tsyurupa and Rykov.
In my opinion, the co-operatives are not the trade unions.
The co-operatives should remain obligatory as regards membership.
Contributions should be voluntary.
If our co-operatives will carry on trade (and not play at publishing dailies in which idle chatter-mongers engage in political twaddle, which everyone is fed up with), then trading should yield an income.
Those who make contributions will receive an income.
Everybody should be a member of the co-operatives.
We need this for the future.
I don’t see how this interferes with anything.
Shares are voluntary.
Those who have paid their contrib-utions should receive a share of the profit.
Conclusion: I think the matter should be postponed; it should not be raised at this session.

466 2) On the same page, lines 8 and 9 up—all mention of “inevitable forcible revolution and the use of sanguinary struggle” must definitely be thrown out; instead we should speak only of the fact that we Communists do not share the views of the pacifists—a fact which is sufficiently well known from communist literature—but having come here as merchants, we positively consider it our duty to give our fullest support to any attempts at a peaceful settlement of outstanding problems.
3) On the same page, 2nd and 3rd lines up—the words stating that our “historic conception includes the use of forcible measures” should definitely be deleted.
4) Page 2, 2nd and 3rd lines down—the words about our historic conception being definitely based on the inevitabil-ity of new world wars should be definitely deleted.
Under no circumstance should such frightful words be used, as this would mean playing into the hands of our opponents.
We should confine ourselves only to mentioning that the views of the Communists do not coincide with the views of such pacifists as the states we are beginning negotiations with, such statesmen as Henderson, Keynes, etc.
, but that we consider it our duty, in order to achieve the economic agreement we are desirous of concluding, to do everything in our power for the broadest possible fulfilment of at least a certain part of this pacifist programme.

(B.
) DELEGATION IN THE COMINTERN The purpose and sense of the tactics of the united front consist in drawing more and more masses of the workers into the struggle against capital, even if it means making repeated offers to the leaders of the II and II 2 Interna-tionals to wage this struggle together.
When the majority of the workers have already established their class, i.
e.
, their Soviet, and not “general national” (i.
e.
, in common with the bourgeoisie) representation, and have overthrown the political domination of the bourgeoisie, then the tactics of the united front, of course, cannot require co-operation with parties such as that of the Mensheviks (the “R.
S.

P.
”) and the S.
R.
s (the “Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries”) for these have turned out to be opponents of Soviet power.

I have taken the floor to ask the congress to waive standing orders andprocedure.
There is a rule that after a decision has been passed there can be no interference on that question.

2.
That directives be given to the Soviet and Party press to appraise the Berlin agreement from this angle, and to dwell at special length on the factual existing links between the S.

3.
That the publication for the said purpose in all European languages of Savinkov’s pamphlet Fighting the Bolsheviks and of S.
Ivanovich’s pamphlet The Twilight of Russian Social-Democracy should be speeded up and a detailed account given of how these pamphlets prove the real ties that exist between the Right-wing Mensheviks and S.
R.
s and international reaction.
4.
That Comrade Trotsky be directed to see to it that these and similar materials are published in all languages with appropriate comments as quickly as possible.
5.
That Comrade Radek be asked by wire to return to Moscow as soon as possible with the full minutes of the Berlin Conference.
6.
That Comrade Bukharin shall be forbidden to return to Russia until he has completed his cure.

Y.
ZINOVIEV 1 On Point 1 I propose the addendum: dwell at greater length 1) on the real links between our Mensheviks and S.
R.
s and the common front of the landowners and bourgeoisie against the Soviet government, special attention being given for this purpose to Savinkov’s pamphlet Fighting the Bolsheviks (Warsaw, 1920) and S.
Ivanovich’s pamphlet The Twilight of Russian Social-Democracy, as these booklets very clearly reveal what is known, of course, from a number of other documents—namely, that Right-wing Mensheviks and S.
R.
s take refuge behind the name of a common party, as a matter of form, while in fact they act quite independ-ently; 2) pay special attention to showing up the identity of our Mensheviks and S.
R.
s with the leaders of the II and II 2 Internationals, the highly pernicious nature of Otto Bauer’s recent pamphlet, which virtually proposes and preaches panic retreat in the face of capitalism.
Such preaching we regard as tantamount to preaching panic flight at the front during war.
Point 2, I accept.
Re Point 3: I have my doubts about this, as I believe that a precisely worded ruling calling for unanimity should save us from making mistakes, while general appeals on subjects clarify-ing the points endorsed at the Berlin Conference (defence of Soviet Russia, etc.
) will be extremely useful to us, as we shall repeatedly make use of them in future to expose the muddle our opponents have got themselves into.
Re Point 4—I definitely support this.
Re Point 5—I have no objection.
Re Point 6:The purport of this point is not clear to me.
I believe that the Berlin agreement should be ratified immediately upon receipt of the official text of the adopted decisions, or, better still perhaps, it should be ratified at once with the reservation that the text being ratified was the one that was published in Pravda on 9/IV.
I would particularly ask you to arrange for the full text of the minutes of the Berlin Conference to be dispatched as quickly as possible by special courier and to check whether these minutes have been signed by the official representatives of each of the three Internationals.
Lenin Dictated over the telephone April 1 1 , 1 9 2 2 First published in 1 9 5 9 in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI Printed from the secretary’s notes (typewritten copy) 2 Comrade Zinoviev, The following should be added to those points of the Comintern Executive’s decision on which we exchanged notes this morning: Criticism of the policy of the II and II 2 Internationals should now be given a somewhat different character, namely, this criticism (especially at meetings attended by workers who support the II and II 2 Internationals, and in special leaflets and articles written for them) should tend to be of a clarifying nature, made with particular patience and thoroughness, so as not to scare away these workers with harsh words, and bring home to them the irreconcilable contradictions between the slogans their representatives have adopted in Berlin (for example, the fight against capital, the eight-hour day, defence of Soviet Russia, aid to the famine-stricken) and the entire reformist policy.
Perhaps, before publishing this, we ought to verify whether the Berlin decisions have been ratified by the II and II 2 Internationals.
Lenin Dictated over the telephone April 1 1 , 1 9 2 2 First published in 1 9 5 9 in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI Printed from the secretary’s notes (typewritten copy)INTERVIEW WITH THE CORRESPONDENT OF T H E N E W Y O R K H E R A L D 473 In his talk with the correspondent of the American newspaper The New York Herald on the subject of the Genoa Conference, Lenin stated: This Conference should be guided only by one economic principle.
Russia is well aware of what she can expect from the bourgeois states.
The present state of affairs cannot continue any longer.
It is disastrous both for Russia and for the whole world.
Russia stands in need of trade with the bourgeois states.
On the other hand, the bourgeois governments are well aware that the economic life of Europe cannot be adjusted without Russia.
However, those who intend to offer humiliating terms to the Russian delegation at Genoa are deeply mistaken.
Russia will not allow herself to be treated as a vanquished country.
If the bourgeois governments try to adopt such a tone towards Russia they will be committing the greatest folly.

KAMENEV FOR MEMBERS OF THE POLITBUREAU 481 26.
IX Comrade Kamenev, Stalin has probably already sent you the resolution of his commission on the entry of the independent republics into the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
If he has not, please take it from the secretary at once, and read it.
I spoke about it with Sokolnikov yesterday, and with Stalin today.
Tomorrow I shall see Mdivani (the Georgian Communist suspected of “independent” senti-ments).
In my opinion the matter is of utmost importance.
Stalin tends to be somewhat hasty.
Give the matter good thought (you once intended to deal with it, and even had a bit to do with it); Zinoviev too.
Stalin has already consented to make one concession: in Clause 1, instead of “entry” into the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
, to put: “Formal unification with the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
in a Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia.
” I hope the purport of this concession is clear: we consider ourselves, the Ukrainian S.
S.
R.
and others, equal, and enter with them, on an equal basis, into a new union, a newfederation, the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia.
Clause 2 needs to be amended as well.
What is needed besides the sessions of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
is a “Federal All-Union Central Executive Committee of the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia.
” If the former should hold sessions once a week, and the latter once a week (or once a fortnight even), this may be easily arranged.
The important thing is not to provide material for the “pro-independence” people, not to destroy their independence, but to create another new storey, a federation of equal republics.
The second part of Clause 2 could stand: the dissatisfied will appeal (against decisions of the Council of Labour and Defence, and the Council of People’s Commissars) to the Federal All-Union Central Executive Committee, without thereby suspending implementation (just as in the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
).
Clause 3 could stand, but its wording should be: “amalgam-ate in federal People’s Commissariats whose seat shall be in Moscow, with the proviso that the respective People’s Commissariats of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
have their authorised representatives with a small staff in all the Republics that have joined the Union of Republics of Europe and Asia.
” Part 2 of Clause 3 remains; perhaps it could be said to emphasise equality: “by agreement of the Central Executive Committees of the member republics of the Union of the Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia.
” Let’s think about Part 3: perhaps we had better substitute “mandatory” for “desirable”? Or perhaps insert conditionally mandatory at least in the form of a request for instructions and the authority to decide without such instructions solely in cases of “specially urgent importance”? Clause 4 could perhaps also be “amalgamate by agreement of the Central Executive Committees”? Perhaps add to Clause 5: “with the establishment of joint (or general) conferences and congresses of a purely consultative nature (or perhaps of a solely consultative nature)? Appropriate alterations in the 1st and 2nd comments.
Stalin has agreed to delay submission of the resolution to the Political Bureau of the Central Committee until my return.
I shall arrive on Monday, October 2.
I should like to see you and Rykov for about two hours in the morning, say 12 noon to 2 p.
m.
, and, if necessary, in the evening, say 5-7 or 6-8.
That is my tentative draft.
I shall add or amend on the strength of talks with Mdivani and other comrades.
I beg you to do the same, and to reply to me.
Yours, Lenin P.

4 5 Lenin Printed from the typewritten copy TO THE RUSSIAN COLONY IN NORTH AMERICA 487 Comrade Reichel, a representative of the American Society for Technical Aid for Soviet Russia, told me about the incorrect view on the New Economic Policy prevalentamong some members of the Russian colony in North America.
This incorrect view could, I believe, be the result of deliberate misinterpretation of this policy by the capitalist press and the ridiculous tales spread by the embittered whiteguards, who have been driven out of Soviet Russia, as well as by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.
In Europe these tales about us and especially about our New Economic Policy are falling into disuse.
The New Economic Policy has changed nothing radically in the social system of Soviet Russia, nor can it change anything so long as the power is in the hands of the workers—and that Soviet power has come to stay, no one now, I think, can have any doubt.
The malignity of the capitalist press and the influx of Russian whiteguards in America merely prove our strength.
The state capitalism, which is one of the principal aspects of the New Economic Policy, is, under Soviet power, a form of capitalism that is deliberately permitted and restricted by the working class.
Our state capitalism differs essentially from the state capitalism in countries that have bourgeois governments in that the state with us is repre-sented not by the bourgeoisie, but by the proletariat, who has succeeded in winning the full confidence of the peasantry.
Unfortunately, the introduction of state capitalism with us is not proceeding as quickly as we would like it.
For example, so far we have not had a single important conces-sion, and without foreign capital to help develop our economy, the latter’s quick rehabilitation is inconceivable.
Those to whom the question of our New Economic Policy—the only correct policy—is not quite clear, I would refer to the speeches of Comrade Trotsky and my own speech at the Fourth Congress of the Communist International * devoted to this question.
Comrade Reichel has told me about the preparatory work which the Society for Technical Aid is doing to organise American agricultural and other producers’ communes who wish to come out to work in Russia and intend to bring with them new instruments of production, tractors, seeds of improved cultures, and so on.

I have already expressed my gratitude to the American comrades in my letters to the Society for Technical Aid and the Society of Friends of Soviet Russia in connection with the very successful work of their agricultural communes and units in Russia in the summer of 1922.
* I take this opportunity to thank you once more on behalf of the Soviet Government and to stress the fact that of all the forms of aid the aid to our agriculture and improve-ment of its technical methods is the most important and valuable for us.

The necessity of fighting for transition demands subject to appropriate reservations making these demands dependent on concrete conditions of place and time should be stated explicitly and categorically in the national programmes.
4.
The theoretical basis for all such transition or limited demands should be definitely stated in the general pro-gramme, the Fourth Congress declaring that the Comintern emphatically condemns both the attempts to represent the inclusion of limited demands in the programme as opportunism, and all and any attempts to use limited demands to obscure and side-track the basic revolutionary task.
5.
The general programme should clearly state the basic historical types of transition demands of the national parties depending on cardinal differences of economic structure, as for example, Britain and India, and such-like.

All the above-mentioned work is distributed among the deputies in such a way that each of the three (and if need be their assistants from among the business managers) handles a definite job for two months and afterwards changes it for another.
This is necessary in order that all the deputies may acquaint themselves with the entire apparatus and in order to achieve real unity of management.
) 5.
The draft of such a distribution among the three deputies is to be drawn up by them immediately and approved by all four.
6.
Since the work of improving and correcting the whole apparatus is far more important than the work of chairman-ship and the chatting with Deputy People’s Commissars andPeople’s Commissars, which has up till now fully occupied all the deputies’ time, it is necessary to arrange and strictly carry out a practice under which each deputy, for not less than two hours a week, “goes down to the bottom”, makes a personal study of all the various parts of the apparatus top and bottom, and the most unexpected ones at that.
The official record of such a study, made, confirmed and communicated (in certain cases) to all government depart-ments, should lead to a reduction in staff and tighten up discipline throughout our state machinery.

L.
D.
Comrades Kamenev, Rykov and Tsyurupa Owing to a recurrence of my illness I must wind up all political work and take a holiday again.
492 Therefore our disagreements with you lose their practical significance.
I must say, however, that I utterly disagree with Rykov’s practical addendum, and I move the exact opposite against it—namely, that reception should be quite free, unlimited and even extended.
493 I am leaving the details until a personal meeting.
To a considerable extent I disagree also with the distribution of the commissariats.
I think this distribution should be more closely adjusted to the ability for purely administrative work on the part of the various deputies; in my opinion, the chief fault of your yesterday’s distribution consists in the lack of such adjustment.
494 The functions of chairmanship and supervision of the proper legal wordingof both legislative acts and decisions of the Financial Committee and so forth should be far more strictly separated from the functions of checking and improving the admini-strative apparatus.
Comrade Kamenev is more suitable for the former functions (i.
e.
, chairmanship, supervision of proper wording, etc.
) whereas the purely administrative functions are more in Tsyurupa’s and Rykov’s line.
For the general reason mentioned above I must defer this question until my return from leave.
But please bear in mind that I give my consent to your proposed distribution, not for three months (as you suggest), but pending my return to work, should this take place earlier than within three months.
I see that your distribution has overlooked such an important organ as Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn, which needs someone to keep a special eye on it.
I think this could best be done by Rykov.

Dictated not later than January 9 , 1 9 2 3 First published in 1 9 5 9 in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI Printed from the secretary’s notes (typewritten copy)2 WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THE W.
P.
I.
? Without a doubt, the W.
P.
I.
is an enormous difficulty for us.
So far nothing has come of it, and the question of its organisation and even its expediency remains a question.
I think that those who doubt whether there is any need for it are wrong.
At the same time, however, I do not deny that the problem presented by our state machinery and the task of improving it is very difficult and far from being solved.
With the exception of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, our state apparatus is largely a survival of the past, and least of all affected by any drastic change.
It has only been slightly touched up on the surface.
In all other respects, in order to get it to work properly, it has always been necessary for the workers’ and peasants’ state—a state built entirely on new lines—to concentrate mem-bers of the Party in it throughout the hierarchical framework.
It is worth remembering how we acted in the critical moments of the civil war, how we concentrated our best Party forces in the Red Army, how we resorted to the mobilisation of the advanced workers from among the Party ranks—in order to confirm what has been said.
And so, I believe, as a result of all our attempts to reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection there emerges the conclusion that we have not made one more attempt.
Namely, we have not tried to put this matter into the hands of our workers and peasants, by placing them at the head of our Party as members of the Central Committee.
I visualise this reform of the W.
P.
I.
in the following manner: some 50 to 75 workers and peasants, fully tried and trusted as to conscientiousness and devotion, are elected to the C.
C.
of the Party in addition to the other C.
C.
members.
At the same time, the staff of the W.
P.
I.
should be reduced at last (at long last!) to several hundred, con-sisting, on the one hand, of persons with most experience in W.
P.
I.
work in general, i.
e.
, persons who are most familiar with the general supervision of our apparatus of highly skilled specialists and who have a knowledge ofboth our apparatus and of the principles and problems of office work organisation, methods of verification and investigation—and, on the other hand, of persons of the purely secretarial, auxiliary staff.
The task of the new members of the C.
C, who have fully equal rights with the other members of the C.
C.
, is, by long hard work, to make a study of and improve our state machinery.
All the other members of the W.
P.
I.
staff are to help them in this, some as persons most familiar with this machinery and with the work of the W.
P.
I.
, others as employees of the secretarial type.
At the same time the People’s Commissariat of Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection could remain the same commis-sariat it has been up till now.
The new members of the C.
C.
could be considered temporarily attached to it.
The People’s Commissar of the W.
P.
I.
could retain his present rank, position and rights along with the members of his Board.
What do we stand to gain from such an organisation? First of all, we would drop once and for all the practice of new reorganisations undertaken on the basis of an inadequate study of our apparatus.
Secondly, we would enhance the authority of this commissariat both by means of enlisting members of the C.
C.
to it and by reducing its staff to a few hundred members.
From the present position, under which the members of the People’s Commis-sariat of the W.
P.
I.
as a general rule live on sops from the inspected institutions, we would pass immediately to a position under which the maximum independence of the W.
P.
I.
employees would be guaranteed either by a very high salary (this could be achieved by reducing the number of the staff to a few hundred very highly skilled and tested top-level workers), or by those assistants of a purely secretarial type, who would be under the constant control and supervision of both the above-mentioned members of the C.
C.
and of the few specialists left by us after careful screening of the commissariat’s staff The new members of the Central Committee would be assigned the task of making a closer and more careful study of our machinery of state in all its ramifications, including, incidentally, the state trusts.
This job cannot be done quickly.
No definite time limit, therefore, would be set for them.
On the other hand, they could reckon on several years work by alternating members of the C.
C.
working on the same assignment, i.
e.
, by a decision of a Party congress we would guarantee to members of the C.
C.
the possibility of working at this job for several years and then returning to their former jobs.
Lenin January 9, 1923 Taken down by M.
V.
WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THE W.
P.
I.
? (continuation) I foresee that this plan will evoke no end of objections, most of which will be prompted by the vicious howl of the worst of the old elements in our state apparatus, who have remained really old, that is, pre-revolutionary.
They will say that this will lead to nothing but complete chaos in the work that the C.
C.
members, not knowing what to do, will loiter about the commissariats and government offices, interfering everywhere with the work, demanding explana-tions, etc.
, etc.
I think that the nature of these objections clearly betrays the source they come from, and are hardly worth answering.
Obviously, if we had in mind an ordinary type of staff, some of these objections might be warranted.
But the thing is, we do not have in mind the usual type of staff for this commissariat, but single out for it the best workers, who, on verification by the Party congress, deserve to be elected to the C.
C.
In this way, I believe, we guarantee that the staff of the People’s Commissariat of the W.
P.
I.
will be as good as the best of our commissariats, namely, the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs.
How do we account for the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs having the best staff of employees? In the first place, because diplomats of the old stamp could not remain there to any noticeable degree; secondly, because we selected people there anew, selected them by entirely new standards, by their fitness for the new tasks; thirdly, because there, in the Foreign Commissariat, we do not have, as in other commissariats, that plethoraof haphazardly selected employees who, practically speaking, have inherited all the old qualities of officialdom; and fourthly, because the Foreign Commissariat is working under the direct guidance of our Central Committee.
This, as a matter of fact, is the only one of our commissariats that has been fully renovated and that is really working for the workers’ and peasants’ government and in the spirit of that government, and not merely giving the impression of working for it, while actually, in the main, working against it or in the wrong spirit.
Now what conditions are we faced with in our attempt to make a truly renovated apparatus out of the W.
P.
I.
? The first condition—conscientiousness, will be fully ensured by selection; the second condition is the high qualities of the staff members as regards their devotion to the cause and their abilities; the third condition is their closeness to the highest Party body and their equal rights with those who lead our Party, and, through it, the whole of our state apparatus.
It may be said that no amount of conscientiousness or Party authoritativeness can make up for what, in this case, is the most important thing, namely, knowledge of one’s business, knowledge of our state apparatus, and knowledge of the way it should be remodelled.
My reply to this is that one of the essential conditions of my proposal is that we are not to expect quick results in the work of the new commissariat and anticipate that this work will go on for many years.
The question then boils down to organising the work of the new commissariat.
And here I feel justified in presuming that both our Party workers and the people now in charge of the W.
P.
I.
have accumulated sufficient experience, sufficient knowledge, sufficient ability and other qualities to properly organise the training of the new C.
C.
members, and a practical training at that, i.
e.
, by combining their familiarisation with all the details of our state apparatus with a study of what modern science has achieved in the bourgeois states as regards efficient organisation of every kind of staff work.
Lenin January 13, 1923 T a k e n d o w n b y L.

WHAT SHOULD WE DO WITH THE W.
P.
I.
? (continuation 2) I assume that it goes without saying that the W.
P.
I.
will start at once, on the basis of five years experience, organising the work on new lines; that it will divide the new workers into a number of groups and assign the work among these groups systematically; that it will divide these groups into: periodically employed people making a practical study of foreign experience; into people engaged in theoretical work and studying the results of modern science in the field of organisation of labour generally and managerial work in particular.
It will arrange for all the W.
P.
I.
workers to go through the jobs assigned to them, systematically working from the bottom upwards, performing varied functions in varied fields of administration, in varied localities, in varied conditions of work as regards nationalities, and so on.
In short, I assume that the comrades in the W.
P.
I.
have learned something during these five years and will be able to apply the knowledge they have gained to the new organi-sation of the commissariat.
Moreover, it should not be forgotten that we have, I believe, three scientific institutions carrying out research into problems of work organisation (the Central Institute of Labour, a special group under the W.
P.
I.
and a group under the Military Commissariat).
A meeting of these three groups was held recently, 495 and it is to be hoped that their work will now proceed in a more efficient manner and in a better team spirit than heretofore.
What is the new work organisation that I propose on the part of the Secretariat of our C.
C.
? Naturally, the increased number of C.
C.
members will require a new organisation of the work.
I must point out, however, that actually we have already passed to a form of organisation of our C.
C.
plenums after the type of highest conferences.
The thing now is to organise the training of these new C.
C.
members in all Central Committee work and familiarise them with the work of the leading state institutions.
If we are late with this, we shall not be fulfilling one of our main duties, namely, that of taking advantage of our being in power in orderto teach the best elements of the working people all the details of administration.
Such measures as making better arrangements for the meetings of our Politbureau, holding them twice a week and reducing the length of sittings, better preparation of all the documents for these meetings and arranging for these documents to be at the disposal of all the members of the C.
C.
in good time.
These measures now follow from the entire course of the work and are essential, so much so that any kind of objection to this is hardly conceivable.
Naturally, this will call for an increase in expenditure on secretarial type personnel, but to grudge the money for these expenses would be most unwise.
Besides, frankly speaking, an important advantage in increasing the number of C.
C.
members I consider to be the diminished chances of a personal, incidental element being introduced in its decisions; these decisions will be better prepared, the endorsements made at such meetings will be more thoroughly verified, and as a result there will be greater stability in our C.
C.
.
both as regards the continuity of its work and its power to resist splits that might arise from insufficient contact of this body with the masses.

A little after 8 Vladimir Ilyich called me to his flat.
In the course of 4 minutes he dictated.
Felt bad.
Doctors called.
594 Before starting to dictate, he said: “I want to dictate to you a letter to the congress.
Take it down”.
595 Dictated quickly, but his sick condition was obvious.
Towards the end he asked what the date was.
Why was I so pale, why wasn’t I at the congress, 596 was sorry that he was taking up the time that I could have spent there.
I received no more orders.
December 4 (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Next day (December 24) between 6 and 8 Vladimir Ilyich called me in again.
Warned me that what he had dictated yesterday (December 23) and today (December 24) was strictly confidential.
He emphasised this again and again.
Demanded that everything he was dictating should be kept in a special place under special responsibility and to be considered categorically secret.
He then added another order.
597 Sukhanov’s “Notes on the Revolution”, Volumes III and IV, were taken for Vladimir Ilyich.
December 9 Through Nadezhda Konstantinovna Vladimir Ilyich asked that lists of the new books be made up.
The doctors have allowed him to read.
Vladimir Ilyich is reading Sukhanov’s “Notes on the Revolution” (Volumes III and IV).
Vladimir Ilyich is not interested in fiction.
He asked that the lists be made up by sections.
January 5 , 193 .
Vladimir Ilyich asked for lists of new books as from January 3 and Titlinov’s book “The New Church”.
598 January 17 (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva) .
Vladimir Ilyich called me in for half an hour between 6 and 7.
He read and made corrections to his notes on Sukha-nov’s book on the revolution.
In the course of 10-15 minutes dictated a continuation on the same subject.
599 Was pleased with the new stand that made it easier for him to read books and his own manuscripts.
When dictating the sentence “Our Sukhanovs .
.
.
” he paused at the words “.
.
.
never even dream .
.
.
” and while pondering the continuation, jokingly remarked: “What a memory! I have completely forgotten what I was going to say! Dash it! Extraordinary forgetfulness!” He asked me to type the notes at once and give them to him.
Watching him during dictation for several days running I noticed that he did not like to be interrupted in the middle of a sentence, as he lost the thread of his thoughts.
January 18 (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva) .
Vladimir Ilyich did not send for me.
January 19 (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva) .
Vladimir Ilyich sent for me round about 7 and a little after 8.
Dictated his second variant about the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (“How We Should Reorganise the W.
P.
I.
” 600 ) for about 30 minutes.
Said he wished to get it finished as quickly as possible.
January 0 .
Vladimir Ilyich called me in today between 12 and 1 o’clock.
Read his article “How We Should Reorganise the W.
P.
I.
” Made amendments and additions to it.
Said that Nadezhda Konstantinovna would give him information relating to one part of his article, and asked Lydia Alexandrovna to find out the same thing: what and how many bodies there were dealing with the scientific organisation of labour, how many congresses had been held on the subject and what groups had been represented at them.
Was there any material in Petrograd? (Khloplyankin 601 had sent the same material as Nadezhda Konstantinovna had, a little more detailed.
) Asked for a full list of books.
602 I was with him for about 30 minutes.
January 1 (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva) .
Vladimir Ilyich did not send for me.
January (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva) .
Vladimir Ilyich called me in for 25 minutes (from 12 to 12.
25).
Made corrections in the 2nd variant of the W.
P.
I.
article.
Finally chose this variant.
As his time was limited he was in a great hurry.
Asked me to put the article in order, retype it and give it to him by the evening.
Nadezhda Kon-stantinovna, when letting me in, said he had stolen several minutes to look through the article.
Nadezhda Konstantinov-na told me that the nurse (on duty) had not wanted to let me in to him.
After I had left, Nadezhda Konstantinovna came into the secretariat to tell me Vladimir Ilyich’s request “to leave a space in the places, if any, which I had notmanaged to take down”.
She said that Vladimir Ilyich, being in a hurry, imagined that I had difficulty in following him.
I asked him to be told that I had taken it all down, and if I had any doubts I would do as he had asked.
January 3, (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Vladimir Ilyich sent for me between 12 and 1 o’clock.
Once more glanced through the article mentioned above and made slight changes.
Asked me to insert them in his copy and ours and give one to Maria Ilyinichna for Pravda.
Article corrected and handed to Maria Ilyinichna before 3 o’clock.
He asked whether Lydia Alexandrovna had come back and whether our holidays were over? January 30 (entry by L.
A.
Fotieva).
On January 24 Vladimir Ilyich sent for Fotieva and gave instructions to ask Dzerzhinsky or Stalin for the materials of the commission on the Georgian question and to make a detailed study of them.
This assignment was given to Fotieva, Glyasser and Gorbunov.
Object—report to Vladimir Ilyich, who wanted this for the Party congress.
Apparently, he did not know the question was up at the Politbureau.
603 He said: “Just before I got ill Dzerzhinsky told me about the work of the commission and about the ‘incident’, and this had a very painful effect upon me.
” On Thursday, January 25, he asked whether the materials had been received.
I answered that Dzerzhinsky would not be arriving until Saturday.
Therefore I had not yet been able to ask him.
On Saturday I asked Dzerzhinsky, he said Stalin had the materials.
I sent Stalin a letter, but he was out of town.
Yesterday, January 29, Stalin phoned saying he could not give the materials without the Politbureau.
Asked whether I had not been telling Vladimir Ilyich things he was not to be told—how was it he was posted about current affairs? For instance, his article about the W.
P.
I.
showed that certain circumstances were known to him.
I answered that I had not been telling anything and had no reason to believe he was posted about affairs.
Today Vladimir Ilyich sent for me to learn the answer and said that he would fight to get the materials.
On January 26 Vladimir Ilyich gave instructions for Tsyu-rupa, Svidersky and Avanesov to be told that if they agree with his article, they should arrange a number of conferences and discuss by way of preparation for the congress whether or not a plan should be drawn up, a synopsis of textbooks (apparently on the normalisation of labour).
Do they know the books by Kerzhentsev and Yermansky? 604 There is a plan of scientific organisation of labour, there is a normalisation department at the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection.
Today he asked what answer Tsyurupa had given, whether he, Svidersky, Avanesov, and Reske 605 agreed with the article.
And other members of the Board? I said I did not know this.
He asked, wasn’t Tsyurupa dilly-dallying, procrastinating, was he frank with me.
I said I had not had a chance to speak to him yet, I had only given him the instructions, which he said would be duly carried out.
On January 24 Vladimir Ilyich said: “First of all, about this ‘secret’ job of ours—I know that you are deceiving me.
” To my assurances to the contrary, he answered: “I have my own opinion about that.
” Today, January 30, Vladimir Ilyich said that yesterday, on asking whether he could address the congress on March 30, the doctor had answered in the negative, but had promised that he would be up by that time and within a month would be allowed newspapers.
Reverting to the question of the Georgian commission, he said, laughingly: “That is not newspapers, so I can read it now.
” Apparently not in a bad humour.
No compress on his head.
February 1 (entry by L.
A.
Fotieva).
Today Vladimir Ilyich sent for me (at 6.
30 p.
m.
).
I told him the Politbureau had permitted the materials to be given out.
606 He gave instructions what to pay attention to and generally how to use them.
607 Vladimir Ilyich said: “If I were at large (at first he made a slip, then repeated, laughing: if I were at large) I would easily do all this myself.
” It had been estimated that their study would take 4 weeks.
He asked what the attitude of Tsyurupa and the others was towards his article.
I answered, according to the direc-tions of Tsyurupa and Svidersky, that Svidersky was fully in agreement.
Tsyurupa approved it in the part referring to the enlistment of Central Committee members, and doubted whether it was possible for the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection to discharge all its present functions with a staff reduced to 300-400 people.
I do not know Avanesov’s point of view.
Tomorrow there is to be a meeting of the whole Board.
He asked whether the question of the article had been up before the Central Committee.
I answered that I did not know this.
Vladimir Ilyich was satisfied with these reports.
February , (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Vladimir Ilyich sent for me at 11.
45.
Dictated article “Better Fewer, But Better”.
608 Finished at 12.
30.
Asked Lydia Alexandrovna to come every other day.
When asked, “At what time”, he said that he was now a free man.
Casually mentioned that the only time that was ruled out was from 2 to 5; said 6 might do, or to arrange it with his sister.
I had not seen him since January 23.
Outwardly, a considerable change for the better: fresh, cheerful looking.
Dictates, as always, excellently: without halts, seldom at a loss for words, speaks, gesticulating, rather than dictates.
609 No compress on his head.
February 3 (entry by L.
A.
Fotieva).
Vladimir Ilyich sent for me at 7 o’clock for a few minutes.
Asked whether we had looked through the materials.
I answered that only externally and that they were less than we had expected.
Asked whether this question had been up before the Politbureau.
I answered that I had no right to talk about it.
Asked: “Have you been forbidden to speak precisely and particularly about this?” “No, I have no right generally to talk about current business.
” “So this is current business?” I realised that I had made a slip.
I repeated that I had no right to talk.
He said: “I heard about this business from Dzerzhinsky before I got ill.
Has the commission reported to the Politbureau?” “Yes, it has.
The Politbureau has endorsed its decision as far as I remember.
” He said:“Well, I think you will make your report in about three weeks, and then I’ll send them a letter.
” I answered: “We may not manage it in three weeks.
” The doctors came (Foerster, who had just arrived, Kozhevnikov and Kramer) and I went away.
Looked cheerful and buoyant, perhaps somewhat excited at Foerster’s visit—Foerster had not seen him for some time.
February 4, (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Vladimir Ilyich sent for me today round about 6 o’clock.
Asked whether I did not mind him calling me on holidays.
(“You must take a rest, too, sometimes, mustn’t you?”) Dictated continuation of his article “Better Fewer, But Better” for over half an hour.
Looked fresh, voice cheerful.
No compress.
Ended with the words: “Well, that’ll do for the time being.
I’m a bit tired.
” Asked me to type it out and phone him when I had finished, as he would probably continue the article that day; said it was an old habit of his to write with the manuscript in front of him, other-wise he found it difficult to write.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna told me that the German doctor (Foerster) had seen him, had told him a lot of pleasant things, allowed him to do gymnastic exercises and allowed him extra time for dictating articles, and that Vladimir Ilyich was very pleased.
At 8 o’clock he sent for me again.
He did not dictate, however, but looked through what he had written and made amendments.
When he had finished he said that before sending the article to the press he wanted to show it to Tsyurupa and perhaps some other members of his board and intended to make certain additions to these thoughts of his.
Dictated more slowly than usual.
Compress on his head.
Face went pale.
Obviously tired.
February 5, (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Today Vladimir Ilyich called me in at 12 o’clock.
I was with him three-quarters of an hour.
Dictated slowly.
In one place, finding difficulty to express himself, he said: “It doesn’t go smoothly with me today somehow, not briskly” (he stressed the word).
Asked for his article “How We ShouldReorganise the W.
P.
I.
” Read it for 3 or 4 minutes in silence.
Then he continued a little longer and decided to stop, saying he would call me in today at 4 or 5, maybe 6 o’clock.
February 5, evening (entry by M.
I.
Glyasser).
Vladimir Ilyich sent for Lydia Alexandrovna at 7 o’clock (ten to 7), but as she was indisposed he sent for me.
Asked whether we had started sorting out the materials of the Georgian commission and by what date we planned to finish this work.
I answered that we had distributed the materials and begun to read them, and as for the date, we expected to keep the deadline he had given us, that is, three weeks.
He asked how we intended to read the materials.
I said we had come to the conclusion that it was necessary for each of us to read everything.
“Is that your unanimous decision?” “Yes.
” Vladimir Ilyich began to figure out how much time was left until the congress.
When I said a month and 25 days, he said that this term was probably sufficient, but if extra information was required, it might prove too little, all the more considering that it would take still longer to go to the Caucasus.
He asked how much each of us was working, and said that in case of need we could use Volodicheva and Shushanika Manucharyants.
Then he asked whether the decision for all to read everything had been formally adopted.
I answered that we had no record of this decision in writing and asked whether he had anything against it maybe.
He said that he would like us all to read everything, of course, but the tasks of our commission were very indefinite.
On the one hand, he would not like to give us too much trouble, but on the other, we have to reckon with the need for widening these tasks as the work progresses It may be necessary to obtain additional material.
He asked where the materials were being kept, how we use them, whether we would make a brief summary of all the materials and whether we would have it typed (“wouldn’t it be too much trouble?”).
Finally, Vladimir Ilyich decided that in the course of the next week we would decide how much time we needed and in what form we would handle these materials, and in handling them we would be guided by the necessity of drawing up a general survey of all the data on the points which the commission had mapped out as wellas on those questions which he would put to us in the course of the work.
Then Vladimir Ilyich ordered inquiries to be made of Popov as to how things stood with the working up of the census materials of the Central Statistical Board in Petro-grad, Moscow and Kharkov (if a census in the last-named city was carried out), and by what date he intends to have them worked up and whether they would be published.
610 Vladimir Ilyich would like to see them in print before the Party congress; he considers that in view of the special importance of this census the materials ought to be published even though those of previous censuses had not been published and Popov had only sent Vladimir Ilyich the tables.
Popov, therefore, had to be got moving.
An official inquiry should be sent to him about this, following a pre-liminary talk.
I was with Vladimir Ilyich altogether 20 minutes.
I was seeing him for the first time since his illness.
I thought he looked well and cheerful, only slightly paler than before.
Speaks slowly, gesticulating with his left hand and stirring the fingers of his right.
No compress on his head.
February 6, evening (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Vladimir Ilyich called me in between 7 and 9.
I was there for about an hour and a half.
First he began to read his article “Better Fewer, But Better”.
The corrections, made in red ink, put Vladimir Ilyich in a good humour (not the corrections themselves, but the way they were inserted!).
The article at his request had not been retyped, and the first deciphered copy had had the corrections added to it which Vladimir Ilyich had made during his reading.
The corrections having been made not in proof-reader style, but in the ordinary secretarial way, Vladimir Ilyich, on second reading, found this inconvenient.
He asked that the next time the whole thing should be retyped anew.
Running through the article, Vladimir Ilyich made passing remarks, spoke about his old habit of writing and not dictating; that he understood now why stenographers do not satisfy him (“did not satisfy him,” he said); that he was accustomed to seeing his manuscript in front of him, stopping, pausing to think over difficult passages, passages in which he had“got stuck”, walking up and down the room, even running away to take a walk somewhere; that even now he often felt like seizing a pencil and writing or introducing correc-tions himself.
He recollected how he tried to dictate an article of his to Trotsky’s stenographer back in 1918, and how, when he felt himself getting “stuck”, he “plunged” on in confusion with “incredible” speed, and how this led to his having had to burn the whole manuscript, after which he sat down to write himself and wrote “The Renegade Kautsky”, 611 with which he was pleased.
Vladimir Ilyich talked about all this very gaily, laughing his infectious laugh.
I had never seen him in such a mood.
He went on dictating part of this article.
Dictation lasted 15-20 minutes.
He stopped the dictation himself.
February 7 (entry by L.
A.
Fotieva).
Vladimir Ilyich sent for me.
Spoke on 3 questions.
1) On the results of the census (asked to be shown the proofs of the census book.
I said there would have to be Stalin’s permission for this).
2) On the Georgian commission.
Asked how the work was getting on, when we would finish reading, when we would get together, and so on.
3) On the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection.
Did the Board now intend to make any decision, “to take a step of state importance” or was it putting things off until the congress.
Said he was writing an article, but was not getting on with it at all, nevertheless he was thinking of revising it and giving it to Tsyurupa to read before sending it to the press.
Gave instructions to ask Tsyurupa whether he was to hurry up with this article or not.
Today Kozhevnikov said that there was a tremendous improvement in Vladimir Ilyich’s health.
He was now moving his arm and had begun to believe himself that he would regain the use of it.
February 7, morning (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
I was with Vladimir Ilyich at about 12.
30.
Said that he would dictate on any subjects and arrange the materialat some future time.
Dictated on the subject of 1) how Party and administrative bodies could be merged, and 2) whether it was convenient to combine educational activities with official activities.
At the words “And the more abrupt the revolution .
.
.
” he stopped, repeated them several times, obviously struggling with them; asked me to help him, re-read the preceding pas-sages, laughed and said “Here I’ve got completely stuck, I’m afraid, make a note of that—stuck on this very spot!” To my remark that I was his unavoidable evil for a short space of time, as he would soon be able to write himself, he said: “Oh, that won’t be so soon!” His voice sounded weary, with a hint of pain in it.
February 7, evening (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Vladimir Ilyich called me between 7 and 9.
Was with him for about an hour and a half.
Completed the sentence at which he had stopped yesterday.
Said: “I shall now try to develop the next subject.
” There and then asked about the subjects he had already noted previously 612 ; when these were read out, he remarked that one of them he had forgotten (on the correlation between the Central Board for Vocational Education and the general educational work among the people).
Dictated the general part of his article “Better Fewer, But Better”.
Dictated fast and freely, without difficulty, gesticulating.
On finishing, said he would try later to fit this part in with his article as a whole.
Tired.
In the evening I learned from Nadezhda Konstantinovna that Vladimir Ilyich would not dictate tomorrow; he intended to read.
February 9 (entry by L.
A.
Fotieva).
In the morning Vladimir Ilyich sent for me.
Confirmed that he would move the question of the Workers’ and Peasant’s Inspection at the congress.
As for the census, he was worried whether the tables would be printed the way they should be.
Agreed to my suggestion that instructions for having this checked should be put through Kamenev or Tsyurupa.
The assignment to be given to Krzhizhanovsky or Svidersky.
Mood and appearance excellent.
Said that Foerster was inclined to allow him to receive visitors ratherthan newspapers, On my remarking that this really would seem to be the best from the medical point of view, he said very gravely after a thoughtful pause that in his opinion it would be worse precisely from the medical point of view, because printed matter could be read and done with, whereas visits evoke an exchange February 9, morning (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Vladimir Ilyich called me in a little after 12.
Said the retyped stuff pleased him better.
Read the part of the article he had dictated yesterday, made practically no corrections.
On finishing, said: “I think I’ve made a good job of it.
” I had the impression that he was very pleased with that part of his article.
Asked me to take down the end: “That is how I link up .
.
.
”, etc.
I stayed for about an hour.
February 9, evening .
Vladimir Ilyich sent for Lydia Alexandrovna.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna asked her to be given the general part of the article, as Vladimir Ilyich wanted her to read it.
February 10 (entry by L.
A.
Fotieva).
Called me in a little past 6.
Asked that the article “Better Fewer, But Better” be given to Tsyurupa to read, if possible within 2 days.
Asked for listed books.
613 Looks tired, speaks with great difficulty, losing the thread of his thoughts and confusing words.
Compress on his head.
February 1 (entry by L.
A.
Fotieva).
Vladimir Ilyich is worse.
Bad headache.
Called me in for several minutes.
According to Maria Ilyinichna, the doctors had upset him so much that his lips quivered.
Foerster the day before had said that he was emphatically prohibited newspapers, visitors and political information.
Asked what he meant by the latter, Foerster replied: “Well, this, for example.
You are interested in the census of Soviet employ-ees.
” The fact that the doctors knew about this upset Vladimir Ilyich.
Apparently, furthermore, Vladimir Ilyich had the impression that it was not the doctors who gaveinstructions to the Central Committee, but the Central Committee that gave instructions to the doctors.
Talked with me about the same 3 subjects, pleaded a headache.
I said jokingly that I would treat him by sugges-tion and in two days he would have no more headaches.
February 14 (entry by L.
A.
Fotieva).
Vladimir Ilyich sent for me a little after 12.
No headache.
Said that he was quite well.
That his was a nervous illness, that sometimes he felt quite well, i.
e.
, his head quite clear, but sometimes he felt worse.
Therefore we had to hurry with his requests, as he wanted to put some things through without fail in time for the congress and hoped that he would manage it.
But if we dragged it out and thus ruined the business, he would be very very annoyed.
The doctors came and we had to break off.
February 14, evening .
Called me in again.
Impediment in speech, obviously tired.
Spoke again on the three points of his instructions.
In special detail on the subject that agitated him most of all, namely, the Georgian question.
Asked to hurry things up.
Gave certain instructions.
614 March 5 (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Vladimir Ilyich did not send for me until round about 12.
Asked me to take down two letters: one to Trotsky, 615 the other to Stalin 616; the first letter to be telephoned personally to Trotsky and the answer given to him as soon as possible.
As to the second letter, he asked it to be put off, saying that he was not very good at it that day.
He wasn’t feeling too good.
March 6 (entry by M.
A.
Volodicheva).
Asked about a reply to the first letter (reply over the tele-phone was taken down in shorthand).
Read the second letter (to Stalin) and asked it to be handed to him personally and receive the answer from his own hands.
Dictated a letter to the Mdivani group.
617 Felt bad.
Nadezhda Konstantinov-na asked that this letter to Stalin should not be sent, and it was held up throughout the 6th.
On the 7th I said I had tocarry out Vladimir Ilyich’s instructions.
She spoke to Kamenev, and the letter was handed to Stalin and Kamenev, and afterwards to Zinoviev when he got back from Petrograd.
Stalin’s answer was received immediately on receipt of Vladimir Ilyich’s letter (the letter was handed to Stalin personally by me and his answer to Vladimir Ilyich dictated to me).
The letter has not yet been handed to Vladimir Ilyich, as he has fallen ill.

2 Printed from the secretaries’ notesNOTES1Vikzhel—the All-Russia Executive Committee of the Railwaymen’s Trade Union, which was set up at the First All-Russia Inaugural Congress of the Railwaymen held in Moscow in July-August 1917.
The Executive was controlled by the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.
After the victory of the armed uprising in Petrograd this Executive Committee became a bulwark of the counter-revolution.
Taking refuge behind statements declaring its neutrality and calling for cessation of the civil war, Vikzhel hindered the dispatch of revolutionary troops from Petrograd to Moscow, where fighting was still going on for the establishment of Soviet power, and threatened to stop railway traffic.
On October 29 (November 11), 1917, Vikzhel adopted a resolution calling for the establishment of a new, “homogeneous socialist government” to include representatives of all the parties “from the Bolsheviks to the Popular Socialists”.
Vikzhel’s counter-revolutionary policy and actions were strongly disapproved by the rank and file.
At the All-Russia Emergency Congress of the Railwaymen held in January 1918 Vikzhel was dismissed, and a new governing body of the Railwaymen’s Union, Vikzhedor, was elected in which the Bolsheviks formed the preponderant majority.

35 2The Draft Decree on the Requisition of Articles of Warm Clothing for the Soldiers at the Front was discussed and approved at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies on November 8 (21), 1917.
Lenin’s addenda in regard to the requisitioning of articles of warm clothing were taken into consideration in the final wording of the decree (see Pravda No.
184, November 22 [9], 1917).
On the question of “the requisition of flats of the rich to relieve the needs of the poor”.
Lenin’s amendment formed the basis of a Draft Decree on Installing the Families of Red Armymen and Unemployed Workers in the Flats of the Bourgeoisie and on the Normalisation of Housing which was approved at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet on March 1, 1918 (see Izvestia No.

36 3This refers to the elections to the Constituent Assembly in the Petrograd Electoral Area held between November 12 (25) and 14 (27), 1917.
These elections, the preliminary results of which became known on November 15 (28) and the final results the nextday, gave the Bolshevik Party 424,000 votes and 6 seats in the Constituent Assembly (out of the twelve assigned to Petrograd); the Cadets received 247,000 votes (4 seats); the Socialist-Revolutionaries 152,000 votes (2 seats, one of them won by the Left S.
R.
s).
The terms “President of the Council of National Commissioners” and “Social Revolutionists” used by the correspondent are better known as “Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars” and p.
36 “Socialist-Revolutionaries”.
4At the elections to the district councils of Petrograd held at the end of May and beginning of June 1917 the Bolshevik tickets received 20 per cent of the votes.
At the elections to the City Council of Petrograd on August 20 (September 2) the Bolsheviks received 33 per cent of all the votes.
In speaking of the September elections Lenin was probably referring to the elections to the district councils of Moscow (held on September 24 [October 7], 1917) at which the Bolsheviks received 51 per cent of all the votes.
This voting, Lenin pointed out, “is in general one of the most striking symptoms of the profound change which has taken place in the mood of the whole nation” (see present edition, Vol.

The Cadets had arranged a demonstration for that day with the intention of forcing the opening of the Constituent Assembly and carrying out a counter-revolutionary coup.

P.
C.
of the report of the presidium of the first Soviet All-Russia Food Congress, which opened in Petrograd on January 14 (27), dealing with the organisation of a single centre for handling the food problem.
The resolution of the congress testified to the important progress achieved in rallying the food supply workers behind the Soviet government.
At the same time the C.
P.
C.
was informed of disagreements between the People’s Commissar for Food A.
G.
Schlichter, on the one hand, and the presidium of the food congress, the All-Russia Food Council (elected in November 1917 at the food congress in Moscow) and the Food Department of the Supreme Economic Council, on the other.
It was in this connection that Lenin wrote his second draft.
The first was adopted by the C.
P.
C.
, but the second was not included in the minutes of the meeting (see pp.
52-53 of this volume).
p.

The decision of the C.
P.
C.
in a slightly different wording was published in Izvestia No.

p.
56 43The original draft was drawn up by the Board of the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture and then submitted for editing to a committee of the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets.
Lenin who was a member of this committee, put in a good deal of work in editing this draft.
His addendum, in a slightly modified word-ing, was incorporated in the law as Article 26, constituting Section V headed: “Establishment of Norms of Land Tenure in Allotting Land Plots for Building, for Agricultural Industries, for Cultural-Educational Purposes, etc.
” (see Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol.
I, Moscow, 1957, p.
414).
p.
56 44This addendum was written by Lenin during the discussion at the meeting of the C.
P.
C.
on January 30 (February 12), 1918, of the draft decree concerning the setting up of an inter-departmen-tal extraordinary commission for guarding the railways—“in order to ensure a regular supply of food and articles of prime necessity to the population”.
Lenin’s addendum was incorporated in the adopted decree as §5 (see Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol.
I, Moscow, 1957, pp.
453-54) On the report of the above commission the C.
P.
C.
also passed a decision based on Lenin’s proposals published below p.

on February 24.
Nevertheless in reply to the radio-telegram of N.
V.
Krylenko, Supreme Com-mander-in-chief of the Soviet troops, proposing that the armistice, previously concluded, should be considered in force, the German command stated that it was no longer valid.
The German troops continued to advance right up to March 3, when the peace treaty was signed.
p.
60 48On January 14 127), 1918, a revolution started in Finland and power passed into the hands of the proletariat.
In February, on the initiative of the workers’ government of Finland—the Council of People’s Representatives—negotiations were commenced for signing a peace treaty between the Russian and Finnish socialist Republics.
The draft treaty drawn up by the Russo-Finnish Con-ciliation Board was discussed at meetings of the Council of People’s Commissars held on February 25, 27 and 28.
The treaty was signed by representatives of the contracting parties on March 1.
Lenin took an active part in drawing up the treaty.
He talked with the delegates of the Finnish workers’ government, who had been authorised to sign the treaty, and he edited the draft (see Lenin Miscellany XXI, pp.
241-43).
This was the first treaty in history between two socialist repub-lics, an example of a new type of international relationships— fraternal, friendly relationships between equal sovereign states where the working class had come to power.

P.
C.
on Feb-ruary 27, 1918.
§ 13 of the “Treaty Between the Russian and Finnish Socialist Republics” stated that “The Russian Federative Soviet Republic grants all the political rights of Russian citizens to Finnish citizens residing in Russia who belong to the working class or to the peasants who do not employ other people’s labour, if they live on the territory of Russia for the purpose of engaging in labour occupa-tions.
The Finnish Socialist Workers’ Republic, for its part, under-takes to give citizens of the Russian Federative Soviet Republic in Finland every facility to enjoy political rights, special consideration being given to the interests of the working popula-tion who have no permanent domicile” (Decrees of the Soviet Govern-ment, Vol.
I, Moscow, 1957, p.
508).
p.
62 51This draft was written by Lenin and adopted by the C.

p.
63 53This refers to the proposal made by representatives of the C.
C.
of the Water Transport Workers Trade Union that the management of water transport be concentrated in the hands of the Trade Union.
At the meeting of the C.
P.
C.
on March 4, 1918, the question of setting up a water transport management board was discussed.
According to the decision of the C.
P.
C.
the management of water transport was entrusted to the Supreme Economic Council, under which a Waterways Department was being set up; the Board of this Department was to consist of representatives of the S.
E.
C.
, the C.
P.
C.
, the Water Transport Workers Trade Union and the regional economic councils.
The C.
P.
C.
rejected the anarcho-syndicalist demands of the water transport workers.
On Lenin’s motion the C.
P.
C.
decided to immediately set up a Board on the basis of § 3 of the C.
P.
C.
’s decision of February 27, to temporarily increase the number of trade union representatives on the Board, and take steps to imme-diately dispatch currency notes to pay the wages of the workers on the Volga and the Mariinsk system.
The chief points of this decision of the C.
P.
C.
were drafted by Lenin (see p.
66 of this volume).
p.
63 54Lenin is referring to the Decree of the C.
P.
C.
on the Nationalisa-tion of the Merchant Fleet adopted on January 23 (February 5), 1918.
The decree was published on January 26 (February 8) in Gazeta Vremennogo Rabochego i Krestyanskogo Pravitelstva No.

p.
67 59Lenin is referring to the speech of A.
Balfour, the British Foreign Minister, in the House of Commons on March 14, 1918, in which the latter tried to cover up the true aims of the Japanese inter-vention by hypocritically alleging that in occupying Siberia with the consent of the Allies, and seizing the Siberian railway, Japan would be preventing a German invasion of northern Asia.
p.
67 60The draft decree instituting state control over all forms of insurance was discussed at the meeting of the C.
P.
C.
on March 23, 1918.
The decree was adopted with amendments.
Lenin’s proposals formed the basis of § V of the decree.
In addition Lenin clarified the heading of the decree as follows: Decree on the Establishment of State Control Over All Forms of Insurance Other Than Social (viz.
, Compulsory State) Insurance (the italicised words were added by Lenin).
The decree was published on April 2; 1918, in Izvestia (see Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol.
II, Moscow, 1959, p.
68 pp.
5-11).
61This was dictated to a stenographer by Lenin on March 23-28, 1918.
His work on the article was apparently connected with the forthcoming discussion in the Central Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) of the plan for developing socialist construction.
In his opening speech at the plenary meeting of the C.
C.
held on April 7 Lenin stressed that the revolution was living through a “new period”.
The Central Committee instructed Lenin “to draw up theses con-cerning the present situation and submit them to the C.
C.
” In connection with this decision Lenin wrote his “Theses on the Tasks of the Soviet Government in the Present Situation” (this was the heading given in the manuscript of Lenin’s work The Immediate Tasks of the Soviet Government; see present edition, Vol.
27, pp.
236-77).

62This draft was proposed by Lenin at a meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars on March 26, 1918, at which A.
G.
Shlyap-nikov reported on the All-Russia Congress of Inland Water Trans-port Workers held in Moscow on February 14-26, and at which the Draft Decree on the Management of Water Transport on the Volga presented by Y.

66The joint meeting was held to discuss the project for setting up a trust (“The National Company”) proposed by a group of capi-talists headed by A.
P.
Meshchersky, Managing-Director of the “Sormovo-Kolomna” Industrial Association.
The Board of the Supreme Economic Council passed a decision on April 14, 1918, to break off negotiations with Meshchersky, on April 18, the Council of People’s Commissars turned down Meshchersky’s pro-ject and decided to carry out the nationalisation of the works.
A resolution in favour of nationalisation was passed also by the conference of delegates of the machine-building works held May 12-18, 1918 (see present edition, Vol.
27, pp.
388-89).
p.
88 67The First Congress of Soviets of the Don Republic, which pro-claimed itself the supreme Soviet authority on the Don, was held on April 9-12, 1918.
It was attended by 750 delegates.
Lenin was elected honorary chairman.
The resolution referred to by Lenin was adopted on April 12 by an overwhelming majority, the Men-sheviks’ motion receiving only 2 votes.
The congress approved the Soviet Government’s peaceful policy and stressed in the reso-lution that it regarded the Don Republic as part of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
and considered it its chief task to work for the rehabilitation of the national economy and the creation of a Red Army.
The con-gress declared the working Cossacks’ readiness to defend Soviet power.
p.
88 68This document was incorporated in the Decree on the Registration of Shares, Bonds and Other Interest-Bearing Securities, the draft of which was edited, supplemented and supplied with a heading by Lenin and endorsed after discussion by the C.
P.
C.
on April 18; it was published on April 20 in Izvestia No.
78 (see Decrees of p.

The C.
P.
C.
on April 17, 1918, discussed the application tabled by the Supreme Economic Council for twenty million rubles to be allocated to the Chief Sugar Committee and endorsed Lenin’s draft decision in this connection.
p.
89 70This text, with slight amendments, was incorporated in the Decree on the Institution of an All-Russia Evacuation Commission adopt-ed by the Council of People’s Commissars on April 19, 1918.
The decree was published in the newspapers Znamya Truda and Izvestia on April 23 and 24, 1918 (see Decrees of the Soviet Govern-ment, Vol.

140-42).
p.
90 71The draft decree was on the agenda of the C.
P.
C.
sitting of April 22, 1918, but its consideration was postponed until the next meeting.
The addendum to it was introduced by Lenin after he had examined the draft.
On April 23 the C.
P.
C.
adopted the decree in toto with Lenin’s addendum and the next day finally endorsed it with certain amendments (a new clause was inserted).
Therefore Lenin’s addendum in the text published in Izvestia No.
84 for April 27, 1918, applies to § 7 of the Decree on Supplying Agriculture With Implements and Metals (see Decrees of the Soviet Government, p.
91 Vol.
II, Moscow, 1959, pp.
169-72).
72The draft decree was considered at a meeting of the C.

After a lengthy discussion, the section, under pressure from the “Left” Communists, adopted the Regulations, which ran counter to the policy of the Party and the Government.
On learn-ing of the speeches of the “Left” Communists on the question of management of the nationalised enterprises (see Collected Works, Vol.
50, Fifth Russian edition, p.
84) and reading the Regulations drafted by the section, Lenin proposed that they be examined at the Conciliation Board specially set up on June 2 and at which the C.

96 80These proposals of Lenin’s were written apparently at a meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars on June 8, 1918, when the draft was under consideration.
The draft decree was adopted with substantial amendments.
The All-Russia Central Executive Committee endorsed the decree on June 11 and Izvestia published it on June 16, 1918 (see Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol.
II, Moscow, 1959, pp.
412-19).
The Committees of Poor Peasants were instituted by this decree.
An appraisal of them was given by Lenin in his speech at the First All-Russia Congress of Land Departments, Poor Peasants’ Committees and Communes on December 11, 1918 (see present edition, Vol.
28, p.
338).
p.
97 81This formulation applies to § 2 of the draft decree.
In conformity with Lenin’s proposal, it was worded as follows: “The right to elect and be elected to the volost and village Committees of Poor Peasants shall be enjoyed by all without restriction, both by local villagers and newcomers, with the exception of avowed kulaks and rich farmers having surpluses of grain or other food products, having trade or industrial establishments, and employing farm-hands or hired labour, etc.
“N o t e : Those employing hired labour for farm work not exceeding the subsistence norm may elect and be elected to the Committees of Poor Peasants” (Decrees of the Soviet Government, p.
97 Vol.

Folkets Dagblad Politiken—newspaper of the Swedish Left Social-Democrats, was published in Stockholm from April 1916 (up to November 1917 it was called Politiken).
In 1921 it became the organ of the Communist Party of Sweden, after the split in the party in October 1929 the newspaper passed into the hands of the party’s Right wing.
Publication ceased in May 1945.
p.
101 88This refers to the disarming of the anarchists by the security forces in Moscow on the night of April 12, 1918.
This measure was necessitated by the fact that the various groups of anarchists served as a screen for counter-revolutionary and criminal ele-ments who terrorised the population by their raids and robberies and took refuge in the villas which the anarchists had seized.
The anarchists in Petrograd, who failed to comply with the demand for the surrender of firearms, were disarmed on April 23, 1918.

The hall was crowded to overflowing with workers and Red Armymen.
A sol-dier made a speech on behalf of the First Reserve Artillery Brigade in which he said that in the person of Lenin they greeted the Council of People s Commissars and were ready to defend the workers and peasants government at the Council’s first call.

45-47).
The draft decree for imposing a tax in kind on the farmers was first introduced at a meeting of the C.
P.

on September 4.
It was discussed again at a meeting of the C.

on October 26 endorsed by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on October 30 and published in Izvestia on November 14, 1918.
The extension of foreign military intervention and the civil war prevented this measure from being implemented.
Lenin’s principles for an income tax in kind drafted in 1918 were elaborated and embodied in the food tax in the spring of 1921 which marked the post-war transition to peaceful econom-ic construction on the basis of the New Economic Policy.
Thedecree on the tax in kind adopted in October 1918 was mentioned by Lenin in his report on the political work of the C.
C.
at the Tenth Congress of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
), when dealing with the question of replacing the surplus-appropriation system by a food tax (see present edition, Vol.

107 98Article 12 of the “Basic Law on the Socialisation of the Land” endorsed by the Third All-Russia Congress of Soviets on January 18 (31), 1918, and adopted at the session of the All-Russia Cen-tral Executive Committee on January 27 (February 9) runs as follows: “The distribution of land among the working people shall be carried out on an equalised labour basis in such a manner that the subsistence and labour norm adapted in the given area to the historically established system of land tenure should not exceed the available manpower on each individual farm and at the same time should allow the farmer’s family to make a fairly comfortable living.
” Article 17 of the Law says: “The surplus income derived from naturally fertile superior plots as well as from their more advantageous location for marketing, shall be placed at the disposal of the Soviet authorities to be used for public needs” (Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol.
I, p.
108 Moscow, 1957, pp.
408-09).
99At a meeting of the C.
P.
C.
on October 15, 1918, the People’s Commissariat for Food tabled a proposal that 40 million rubles be allocated for the upkeep of the Poor Peasants’ Committees, apparently for a period of six months at the rate of 6.
5 million rubles per month.
In view of the impending amalgamation of these committees with the local Soviets, Lenin proposed a 2-month allocation of funds (“2 8 6 2 =13”).
The C.
P.
C.
adopted Lenin’s proposal for the allocation of 13 million rubles; the other proposals of Lenin’s were also included in the decision of the C.
P.
C.
(see Decrees of the Soviet Government, Vol.
III, Moscow, 1964, p.
109 pp.
593-95).
100This was written by Lenin in connection with the discussion by the C.
P.
C.
of the report of the Board of Three on logging under the Supreme Economic Council.
All Lenin’s proposals were incorporated in the decision adopted by the C.
P.
C.
on this question.
The latter allocated 100 million rubles for logging operations, demanded an account of their expenditure within a week and ordered the Board of Three, within the same period to submit more concrete information on the questions formulated by Lenin.

The decision was published in Pravda on November 10.

placing the educational institutions and establishments of all departments under the jurisdiction of the People’s Commissariat for Education.
On November 19, 1918, the People’s Commissa-riat for Social Security submitted to the C.
P.
C.
(the question was reported by A.
I.
Ulyanova-Yelizarova) a draft decree leaving the children’s homes under the jurisdiction of this commissariat.
It was in connection with this discussion that Lenin wrote his draft decision, which was adopted with slight changes.
p.
111 103§ 3 of the C.
P.
C.
’s Decree of June 5, 1918, ordered the People’s Commissariat for Education to form special commissions of representatives of the departments concerned and of the Com-missariat for Education to make arrangements for the turnover of the educational institutions and establishments, including the p.
111 institutions of pre-school education.
104 The draft decree on the organisation of supply for the population was discussed at a meeting of the C.
P.
C.
on November 12, 1918, and finally endorsed by the C.
P.
C.
on November 21.
Lenin’s addenda were included in the adopted text of the decree, which was published in Izvestia on November 24.
The question of the co-operatives’ participation in the organi-sation of supply for the population as dealt with in the draft decree with Lenin’s addenda to it, was misunderstood by some of the leading food supply workers.
Lenin clarified this question in a speech delivered at a meeting of delegates from the Moscow Central Workers’ Co-operative on November 26, 1918, in a report on the attitude of the proletariat to petty-bourgeois demo-crats made at a Moscow Party workers’ meeting on November 27, and in his reply to the discussion (see present edition, Vol.

196-200, 213-16, 221-24).

Lenin was appointed Chairman of the Council of Defence.
The documents published here were written by Lenin at the first meeting of the Council of Defence on December 1, 1918.
First Lenin outlined the immediate tasks of the Council and the agenda for its first sitting (Document 1).
Then he jotted down a number of proposals for elaborating these questions, formulat-ing more detailed proposals on the food question (Documents 2 and 3).
Lenin’s proposals were reflected in the decisions of the Council of Defence adopted at its sitting (see Lenin Miscellany p.
112 XVIII, pp.
243-45).

It took into account the opinions expressed by the commis-sion members.
Lenin’s draft was adopted by the commission and included in its minutes.
In the Minutes of the Fuel Commis-sion points 1, 2, 3, 4 are given under a special heading “Decisions of the Commission Having the Force of Defence Council Deci-sions”.
Lenin’s draft, endorsed as a decision, was signed also by Defence Council members J.

The commission, chaired by Lenin, held its first meeting on December 3.
This rough draft was probably made by Lenin during the meeting.
All points of these proposals with the exception of the two last paragraphs were later crossed out by Lenin.
The commission’s decisions were formulated on the basis of Lenin’s proposals.
p.
115 111This refers to the leadership of the boards of the gubernia and railway Chekas.

119120Lenin’s letter to Chicherin was written in connection with the preparations for the first congress of the Comintern.
Already at the beginning of the first world war, when the collapse of the Second International occurred as a result of most of the leaders of the socialist parties in the West adopting a social-chauvinist stand, Lenin put forward the idea of founding a new, truly revolutionary International and pressed forward with a campaign to unite the Left socialist forces in the international labour movement.
The victory of the October Socialist Revolu-tion and its growing impact upon the international revolutionary movement, and the emergence of Communist Parties or groups in a number of capitalist countries made this task more urgent than ever and created favourable conditions for its solution.
The urgent need for uniting the Communists was further dictated by the fact that the opportunist, social-chauvinist leaders had made an attempt to revive the Second International.
The leader-ship of the British Labour Party had addressed a proposal to the socialists of all countries to convene in Lausanne on January 6, 1919, an international socialist conference to rehabilitate the Second International.
In reply to this proposal the Central Com-mittee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) circulated on December 24, 1918, a radio-telegram calling on all revolu-tionary internationalist elements to refuse to take part “in conferences of enemies of the working class wearing the mask of socialism” (Pravda No.
281, December 25, 1918).
At the same time Lenin, as his letter to Chicherin shows, raised the question of convening without delay an international conference of Commu-nists and Left Social-Democrats with the aim of founding the Third International.
p.
119 121This refers to E.
Fuchs, a member of the Central Council of the Spartakusbund.
He arrived in Moscow from Berlin at the end of December 1918 to inform Lenin of the situation in Germany.
p.
119 122A report was drawn up for Lenin on December 31 characterising the parties and organisations mentioned in his list.
In addition to those given by Lenin the report gave the names of eight more organisations.
It also suggested inviting representatives of the Chinese, Korean and Persian revolutionary workers to the con-ference in the capacity of guests.
The same day Lenin received the draft of an appeal “To the First Congress of the Communist International” written at his request and in keeping with his proposals.
Lenin made a number of important amendments to the draft.
In January 1919 the draft appeal “To the First Congress of the Communist International” was submitted by Lenin at a meeting of representatives of a number of communist and socialist parties and organisations.
After a discussion, the meeting adopted the draft.
The appeal was published in the press on January 24, 1918.
The First Congress of the Communist International was held on March 2-6, 1919 (see present edition, Vol.
28, pp.
453-77).

Lenin’s addendum to Point 1 was written in the margin probably after the writing of the draft decision as a whole.
The beginning of Point 1 of the C.
P.
C.
’s decision of January 28 was worded as follows: “Direct the Co-operative Department of the S.

and the People’s Commissariat for Food together with the Central Statistical Board to collect within the shortest possible time information concerning the actual implementation by the p.
123 co-operatives of the basic line of Soviet policy”.

According to the project of the concession’s sponsors the new line was to link the Ob with Petrograd and Murmansk via Kotlas.
No contract for this railway was concluded.

124 128This document was incorporated almost in toto in the resolution of the C.
C.
of the Russian Communist Party adopted on February 19, 1919.
On March 11, 1919, the C.
C.
adopted a new detailed resolution on the food policy in the Ukraine.
On one of the pages of the typewritten text of this resolution, which is kept in the Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, Lenin had written: “Endorsed 11.

p.
125 129Lenin’s unfinished article “On the Appeal of the German Independents” was written in the latter part of February 1919.
The appeal is criticised in § 21 of Lenin’s theses on bourgeois democracy and the dictatorship of the proletariat (see present edition, Vol.
28, p.
467).
p.
126130Lenin is referring to the meeting of the enlarged International Socialist Commission (Internationale Sozialistische Kommission) held in Berne on February 5-9, 1916.
It was attended by 22 dele-gates from the internationalists of a number of countries: Ger-many, Russia, Italy, Norway, Austria, Poland, Switzerland, Bulgaria and Rumania.
Lenin took an active part in the pro-ceedings.
The meeting adopted an appeal “To All Affiliated Parties and Groups” denouncing the participation of socialists in bourgeois governments, the slogan of “Defence of the father-land” in the imperialist war, and voting for war loans; it pointed to the necessity of supporting the labour movement and pre-paring mass revolutionary action against the imperialist war.
The appeal, however, suffered from inconsistency in that it failed to demand a break with social-chauvinism and opportunism.
In voting for the text of the appeal, the members of the Zimmer-wald Left declared at the meeting that although they did not consider all its points satisfactory, they were voting for it because they regarded it as a step forward in comparison with the decisions of the First International Socialist Conference at Zimmerwald.
The meeting fixed the date for convening a second international socialist conference.

131 135The Extraordinary Plenary Meeting of the Moscow Soviet of April 3, 1919, was held jointly with representatives of the district Soviets, factory committees and trade union executives in connection with the aggravation of the food situation in Moscow and theconsequent agitation carried on among the railwaymen by the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries.
The latter called upon the railwaymen to strike and sabotage work in the railway repair shops.
This counter-revolutionary agitation led to a strike in the shops of the Alexandrovsky Railway as a result of which the central workshops were closed on March 31 by order of the People’s Commissariat for Railways and work in them was not resumed until April 3, after the kulak elements had been dismissed.
Lenin made a report at the meeting on the domestic and foreign situation of the Soviet Republic.
A report on the state of railway transport was made by L.
B.
Krasin, and on the food policy by A.
I.
Svidersky.
Speakers in the debate denounced the counter-revolutionary agitation of the Mensheviks and Social-ist -Revolutionaries.
In winding up the debate, A.
V.
Lunacharsky moved the resolution on the domestic and foreign situation of the Soviet Republic drafted by Lenin.
This volume contains the original version of this draft resolution.
The meeting of the Moscow Soviet also adopted a special resolution branding the counter-revolutionary agitation and approving the measures taken by the Commissariat for Railways in regard to the Alexandrovsky railway shops.

The draft, with Lenin’s corrections, is signed by V.

The resolution states: “An essential condition for success in the conduct of the war is unconditional unity of action on all fronts, which, in turn, demands unity of Red Army command on all fronts, unity of Red Army supply on all fronts and unity of transport management of all railways, since transport is of primary importance in the conduct of war.
” The resolution stresses the need for the strictest directives being given to the Commissariats for the Army and the Navy as well as to the supply agencies of the Soviet Republics—“in order that these independent commissariats work exclusively in strict conformity with the directives given by the appropriate Commissariats of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
, since only in this way can the necessary unity, dispatch and accuracy be achieved in the ful-filment of all orders and operations.
” The resolution goes on to say that “the most urgent task in the Ukraine is to make maximum use of fuel, metals, existing factories and workshops, and also stocks of food”.
Pointing out that the whole industry of the Ukraine was concentrated in the eastern part of the republic and that the transfer of the Economic Council from Kharkov to Kiev had adversely affected the rehabil-itation of transport and of the mining and manufacturing indus-tries of the Ukraine, the C.
C.
of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) recognised the need for the Economic Council as well as the Special Commission for Army Supplies of the Ukraine being located in Kharkov or having competent agencies in Kharkov authorised to deal di-rectly with Moscow and to receive money appropriations directly from Moscow.
The C.
C.
of the Party emphasised that “the Ukrain-ian railways are an inseparable part of the Russian railway network and are managed by the People’s Commissariat for Railways from Moscow.
” The resolution also states that “the People’s Commissariat for State Control of the R.

F.
S.
R.
should cover all institutions in the Ukrainian Soviet Republic” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

This resolution of the Party’s Central Committee was an impor-tant step towards strengthening unity in military affairs among the Soviet Republics.

directive to all “nationals” concerning military unity (unification)” (Collected Works , Vol.
50, Fifth Russian Edition, Document 528).
For “Draft C.
C.
Directive on Army Unity” see present edition, Vol.

The military union of the Soviet Republics was officially implemented on June 1, 1919, by a decree of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee “On the Unification of the Soviet Republics of Russia, the Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania and Byelorussia for Fighting World Imperialism”.
p.
135 140On April 21, 1919, Lenin made a report “On Stepping Up Work in the Field of Military Defence” at a meeting of the Council of Defence.

p.
135 141This postscript was written to Béla Kun’s appeal on behalf of the Soviet Government of Hungary to the Hungarian soldiers serving in the Red Army.
“You, Hungarian internationalists,”the appeal stated, “who are fighting on Russian soil against the bands of Kolchak and counter-revolution, are also fighting for the Hungarian Soviet Republic just as your comrades are doing in Hungary, for Hungary and Russia today form a single whole.
” This appeal was issued in April 1919 in Hungarian and promulgated on the civil war fronts.

136 143On May 31, 1919, the Council of Defence considered questions relating to mobilisation.
The Council endorsed the decree drafted by Lenin (see pp.
138-39 of this volume) and decisions directing the People’s Commissariat for Food to provide the mobilised men with food and ordering the conscription status of employees in all departments and institutions to be checked with the object of placing at the disposal of the military command all such persons who were liable for service in the armed forces and who could be replaced without great detriment to the work by persons who were not liable or by women.

137 144The Council of Defence on May 24, 1919, passed a decision allowing Red Armymen of frontline units operating in the rich grain-producing districts to send food parcels to their families in the famine-stricken areas.
The Council ordered the Central Committee of the Food Army to submit not later than June 1 a draft of detailed instructions for the implementation of this decision.
The draft was endorsed by the Council of Defence on July 23, 1919.
p.
139 145Mamontov’s mounted corps was launched by Denikin for attacks behind the lines of the Soviet troops on the Southern Front.
On August 10, 1919, Mamontov’s cavalry broke through the front in the vicinity of Novokhopersk and raided several towns and villages.
This cavalry raid created a threat to the Soviet troops, made offensive operations difficult and interfered with army control and supply in a number of places.
The Party and the Government took emergency measures to fight Mamontov’s cavalry.
On August 23 the Council of Defence declared martial law in Ryazan, Tula, Orel, Voronezh, Tambov and Penza gubernias, on the territory of which all power was vested in the Revolutionary Committees.
These were responsible for organising defence against whiteguard attacks and suppressing counter-revolutionaryactions.
Lenin attached great importance to the organisation of Mamontov’s defeat.
The latter’s corps was routed in October-November 1919.
p.
141 146Lenin had repeatedly demanded that the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic, headed by Trotsky, take drastic meas-ures to fight Mamontov’s troops.
On September 16, 1919, Lenin wrote: “Inaction against Mamontov.
Evidently, there has been one delay after another.
The troops marching on Voronezh from the North were late.
We were late in transferring the 21st Divi-sion to the South.
We were late with the armoured cars.
Late with communications.

143 148The decision of the Politbureau accompanying Lenin’s note was adopted in connection with Chicherin’s letter to Lenin dated September 26, 1919, in which Chicherin asked for instruc-tions on the following points: 1) could an appeal be made without the decision of the C.
C.
of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) to the workers of the Entente countries to bring pressure to bear on their Governments not to interfere in the Soviet state’s negotiations with the Baltic states for concluding peace treaties? 2) Should we make new peace proposals to the Entente countries in the name of the Soviet Government? “This,” wrote Chicherin, “would be construed as a sign of weakness.
.
.
.
On the other hand, it would give an opening to the opponents of intervention, especially to the trade unions”; 3) Could we take advantage of Litvinov’s proposed trip to a neutral country to negotiate an exchange of prisoners of war with the English representatives in order to “throw out a feeler on the question of peace”? 4) In the event of Litvinov’s mission being a failure would it be worth while asking A.
M.
Gorky, who intend-ed to make an appeal for peace, to mention in his letter “our invariable desire for peace and to point out to the Governments of the Entente the risk of the struggle being turned into annihila-tion”? (underlined by Lenin).
“However,” wrote Chicherin, “we should much prefer an official peace proposal.

The newspaper carried on an active campaign to strengthen the alliance between the working class and the peasantry, to organise and rally the mass of the poor and middle peasants behind the Communist Party and the Soviet Government.
Bednota played an important role in promoting the political education and raising the cultural level of the labouring peasantry, in advancing public-spirited activists from among the rural poor and the middle peasantry, and training a numerous army of rural correspondents.
On February 1, 1931, Bednota merged with the newspaper Sotsialisticheskoye Zemledeliye (Socialist Agriculture).

In a short period about 350 men were mobilised.
The first group was seen off on October 22 and arrived in Moscow on October 24.
In a letter to the Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern Front Lenin wrote: “I heartily recommend the bearer, Comrade Stepan Nazarov, a Bolshevik whom I have known personally for a long time.
“Together with other Ivanovo-Voznesensk comrades they formed a well-planned organised group (of from 300 to 500 men) for giving all-round service to and raising the morale of a whole army.

The draft was adopted by the Council with certain amendments.
p.
154 174From the reports of speakers it transpired that one of the prin-cipal reasons for non-fulfilment of the order was the delay on the part of the Commissariat for Post and Telegraph in giving the Food Commissariat a direct line for communicating with the local areas.
This point was adopted by the Council in the following wording: “In all cases of non-receipt of a direct line the guilty party shall be that commissariat, which, not having receivedthe line in the course of an hour for carrying out an important assignment, shall have failed to complain about it to the Chair-man of the C.
P.

155 177On December 23, 1919, the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars examined the question of supplying the workers with clothes and footwear.
It decided to use for this purpose part of the stocks reserved for the Red Army, but in a manner that would not be detrimental to the army.
At the end of December the Central Army Supply Administration was to have issued to the Food Commissariat from army stores 30,000 pairs of leather boots, while the S.
E.
C.
undertook to deliver to the Food Commissariat every fortnight 20 per cent of all the boots manufactured in the country.
Apparently this decision of the Narrow Council met with objection on the part of the Presidium of the S.

“§ 4.
Standard output shall be established on the basis of technically possible output under the best technical condi-tions of production, provided the means and implements of production are in a normal condition.
In view, however, of the general conditions prevailing in industry, a deduction should be made from this technically possible standard, but in no case more than 50 per cent, after which the actual standard of pro-ductivity, varying with the different trades, enterprises and groups, shall be fixed.

Most of the delegates were workers.

166 196Borotbists—members of a petty-bourgeois nationalist party, Borotba, formed in May 1918 after a split in the Ukrainian Social-ist -Revolutionary Party.
So called from the name of the Party’s central organ Borotba (Struggle).
In March 1919 assumed the name of Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party of Communist Borotbists, and in August that of the Ukrainian Communist Party of Borotbists.
Its leaders, among others, were V.
Blakitny, G.
Grinko and A.
Shumsky.
There were a good many counter-revolutionary followers of Petlyura in the ranks of the party, who, under cover of revolutionary phrases and declarations to the effect that they stood on the communist platform, came out against the dictatorship of the proletariat and pursued a policy aimed at splitting the united revolutionary front of the workingpeoples of the Ukraine and Russia.
For Lenin’s appraisal of the Borotba Party see pp.
180 -181 of this volume.
The Borotbists twice applied to the Executive of the Commu-nist International asking to be admitted to membership of the Comintern and to be recognised as the main communist party in the Ukraine.
The Comintern passed a special decision on this question on February 26, 1920, proposing to the Borotbists that they dissolve their party and merge with the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Ukraine.
The resolution said that the Executive of the Communist International could only regard the desire to found a second parallel party as an attempt to split the ranks of the working people.
The growing influence of the Bolsheviks among the peasantry and the successes of the Soviet government in the Ukraine forced the Borotbists to decide on voluntary dissolution.
The Fourth Conference of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of the Ukraine, held March 17-23, 1920, agreed to admit the Borotbists into its ranks, all the newly enrolled members being reregistered.
Eventually, however, many Borotbists resumed their anti-Soviet activities and headed the struggle of the counter-revolutionary bourgeois-nationalist elements in the Ukraine.

Lincoln Eyre of The World was sent to Russia to obtain an interview from Lenin, and was received by him in the company of cameraman Victor Kubes.
The interview was conducted in English, first in Lenin’s private office, then at his rooms in the Kremlin.

In the resolution “On the Present Situation and the Tasks of Our Party” Lenin marked off the following passage: “14.
Summing up the experience of the last year, the Twelfth Conference of the Bund finds: 1) that the Bund, in principle, had adopted the communist platform since the Eleventh Conference, 2) that the Programme of the Communist Party, which is also the programme of the Soviet government, corresponds with the fundamental platform of the Bund, 3) that a ‘united socialist front’ with principled opponents of Soviet power, who draw a line between the proletariat and its govern-ment, is impossible, 4) that the moment has come when the Bund can relinquish its official oppositional stand and take upon itself responsibility for the Soviet government’s policy.
” At the same time, the resolution on organisational questions stated that “the logical consequence of the political stand adopted by the Bund is the latter’s entry into the R.
C.
P.
on the same basis as the Bund’s membership of the R.

The conference authorised the C.

the status of “an autonomous organisation of the Jewish proletariat” (marked off by Lenin).
On May 6, 1920, the Politbureau of the C.

192 216This interview took place in Lenin’s private office in the Krem-lin on June 3, 1920.
Writing from Moscow, Nakahira reported: “I interviewed Mr.
Lenin at his office in the Kremlin.
Contrary to my expectation, the decoration of the room is very simple.
Mr.
Lenin’s manner is very simple and kind—as if he were greet-ing an old friend.
In spite of the fact that he holds the highest position, there is not the slightest trace of condescension in his manner.
” (Osaka Asahi No.
13814 for June 13, 1920.
) The next day, as Nakahira mentions in his later reminiscences, he brought the text of his interview to Lenin, who read it carefully and made several corrections.
Lenin’s interview given to another Japanese correspondent, K.
Fusse, and printed lower down, took place on June 3 or 4.
Possibly both correspondents were received by Lenin together.
Fusse says the interview lasted about twenty minutes.
A.
N.
Voz-nesensky, Chief of the Eastern Department of the People’s Com-missariat for Foreign Affairs, was present at the interview.
Fusse’s interview with Lenin was reported on June 26, 1920, in the Socialist-Revolutionary newspaper Volya published in Vladivostok.
The text of the interview given in this volume was first published in Russian in 1924 in the collection of articles Lenin i Vostok (Lenin and the East) and afterwards in the First Edition of Lenin’s Collected Works (Vol.
XX, Part II).
It was not included in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th (Russian) editions of the Collected Works.
p.
193 217This refers to the Far-Eastern Republic set up in April 1920 on the territory of the Trans-Baikal, Amur, Maritime and Kam-chatka regions and Northern Sakhalin.
In form a bourgeois-democratic state, in essence it pursued a Soviet policy in keeping with the interests of Soviet Russia, which needed a prolonged respite on her Eastern Front and wanted to stave off war withJapan.
At the same time, the creation of a buffer state in the Far East was made necessary by force of circumstances.
As Lenin pointed out, “circumstances made necessary the creation of a buffer state, the Far-Eastern Republic.
We are well aware of the unbelievable sufferings that the Siberian peasants are enduring at the hands of the Japanese imperialists and the atrocities the Japanese have committed in Siberia” (present edition, Vol.
31, p.
465).
After the interventionists and whiteguards were driven out of the Soviet Far East (except Northern Sakhalin), the People’s Assembly of the Far-Eastern Republic voted for entry into the R.

p.
193 218The reference is to the French Socialist Party.
At the outbreak of the imperialist world war the Party’s reformist leadership adopted a social-chauvinist stand of open support of the imperialist war and participation in the bour-geois government.
There was a Centrist trend in the Party headed by Jean Longuet, which took a social-pacifist stand and pursued a policy of conciliation with the social-chauvinists.
There was also a Left, revolutionary wing in the Party which took an internationalist stand and was represented chiefly by its rank and file.
After the October Socialist Revolution a sharp struggle developed within the Party between the open reformists and Centrists on the one hand, and the Left, revolutionary wing, on the other—the latter strengthened by rank-and-file workers who joined the Party en masse.
At the Party’s congress in Tours in December 1920 the revolutionary wing received a majority.
The congress adopted a decision for the Party to join the Commu-nist International and founded the Communist Party of France.
The majority of reformist and Centrists broke away from the Party and formed a separate party, retaining the old name of French Socialist Party.

The commission was vested with the powers of a Government and Party body and was sent to Turkestan to give all possible aid to the local Commu-nists and the working people of Turkestan in overcoming that country’s political, economic and cultural backwardness, con-solidating Soviet power and strengthening the union between the people of Turkestan and Soviet Russia.
One of the commis-sions tasks was to correct mistakes made during the implemen-tation of the national policy in Turkestan.
The Turkestan Commission carried out a number of measures for strengthening the local Party organisations and combating dominant-nation chauvinism and local nationalism.
Important issues were those concerning the principles of Turkestan auto-nomy, relations with the federal bodies, and the forms and methods of Party organisation.

198 221 The Second Congress of the Communist International, which laid the foundations of the Comintern’s programme, tactics and organ-isation was held from July 19 to August 7, 1920, in Soviet Russia.
The opening session was held in Petrograd and the sub-sequent sessions, beginning with July 23, in Moscow.
The con-gress was attended by 169 voting delegates and 49 delegates with a consultative voice representing 67 workers’ organisations of 37 countries.
Apart from delegates representing the Commu-nist Parties and organisations of 31 countries, there were dele-gates from the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Ger-many, the socialist parties of Italy and France, Industrial Work-ers of the World (Australia, Britain and Ireland), the National Confederation of Labour of Spain and other organisations.
The R.
C.
P.
(B.
) was represented at the congress by 64 delegates.
All the preparatory work for convening the congress was directed by Lenin, who attached great importance to this inter-national congress of communist and workers’ organisations.
An important role in defining the tasks and working out the political line of the Comintern was played by Lenin’s book “Left -Wing” Communism—an Infantile Disorder, written for the opening of the Second Congress.
Lenin wrote the “Preliminary Draft Theses on the National and Colonial Questions (For the Second Congress of the Communist International)”, “Preliminary Draft Theses on the Agrarian Question (For the Second Congress of the Communist International)”, “Theses on the Fundamental Tasks of the Second Congress of the Communist International” and “The Terms of Admission into the Communist International” (see present edition, Vol.
31, pp.
144-51, 152-64, 184-201, 206-11).
The congress adopted the following agenda: 1) The Interna-tional Situation and the Fundamental Tasks of the Communist International; 2) The Role and Composition of the Communist Parties Before and After the Conquest of Power by the Prole-tariat; 3) The Trade Unions and the Factory Committees; 4) the Question of Parliamentarism; 5) The National and Colonial Questions; 6) The Agrarian Question; 7) The Attitude to the New “Centrist” Trends and Terms of Admission Into the Commu-nist International; 8) The Charter of the Communist Internation-al; 9) Organisational questions (legal and illegal organisa-tions, women’s organisations, etc.
); 10) The Communist youth movement; 11) Elections; 12) Miscellaneous.
At the opening session of the congress Lenin delivered a report on the international situation and the fundamental tasks of the Communist International (see present edition, Vol.
31, pp.
215-34).
Lenin took an active part in the work of most of the commit-tees—those on the national and colonial questions, on the agrarian question, on terms of admission into the Communist International, and on the international situation and the tasks of the Comintern.
Lenin also made a speech at the congress on the role of the Communist Party, delivered a report of the Committee on the National and Colonial Questions, speeches on the terms of admis-sion into the Communist International, on parliamentarianism and on affiliation to the British Labour Party (ibid.
, pp.
235-63).
The congress adopted Lenin’s theses as a resolution, passed a resolution “On the Role of the Communist Party in the Prole-tarian Revolution”, in the formulation of which Lenin took an active part, and adopted other resolutions, the “Terms of Admis-sion Into the Communist International” and the Charter of the Comintern.
The congress also adopted the Manifesto of the Second Congress of the Communist International.
In addition it published a number of appeals: “The Third International to the Trade Unions of All Countries”, “To the Workers of Petrograd”, “To the Red Army and Red Navy of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
”, “Against the Executioners of Hungary”, “To the Proletarian Men and Women of All Countries”, and others.
The Second Congress of the Comintern played a tremendous role in the development of the international communist move-ment.
After the congress Lenin pointed out that “communism has become central to the working-class movement as a whole” (see present edition, Vol.
32, p.
180).

200226The British Socialist Party was founded in 1911, in Manchester, as a result of the amalgamation of the Social-Democratic Party with other socialist groups.
Its small membership and its poor links with the masses gave the B.
S.
P.
a somewhat sectarian character.
During the First World War a sharp struggle devel-oped within the Party between the internationalists (William Gallacher, Albert Inkpin, John Maclean, Theodore Rothstein and others) and the social-chauvinists headed by Hyndman.
Within the internationalist trend there were inconsistent ele-ments who took a Centrist stand on a number of issues.
In Febru-ary 1916 a group of B.
S.
P.
leaders founded the newspaper The Call, which played an important part in uniting the interna-tionalists.
The annual conference of the B.
S.
P.
, held in Salford in April 1916, condemned the social-chauvinist stand of Hyndman and his supporters, who then left the Party.
The British Socialist Party welcomed the Great October Socialist Revolution.
Its members played an important part in the “Hands off Russia” movement.
In 1919 the overwhelming majority of its organisations (98 against 4) declared for affil-iation to the Communist International.
The British Socialist Party, together with the Communist Unity Group, formed the core of the Communist Party of Great Britain.
At the First (Unity) Congress, held in 1920, the great majority of the B.
S.
P.
local organisations entered the Communist Party.
p.
200 227The American Socialist Party was formed in July 1901 at a con-gress held in Indianapolis as a result of the amalgamation of groups that had broken away from the Socialist Workers’ Party and the Social-Democratic Party of the U.
S.
A.
; one of the organ-isers of the latter was Eugene Debs, a popular figure in the U.
S.
labour movement.
He was also one of the founders of the new party.
The party had a socially mixed membership made up of native-born and immigrant workers, as well as small farmers and people of petty-bourgeois origin.
The party’s Centrist and Right-wing opportunist leaders (Victor Berger, Morris Hillquit and others) denied the necessity of the proletarian dictatorship, renounced revolutionary methods of struggle, and reduced all party activities mainly to participation in election campaigns.
During the First World War (1914-18) three trends appeared in the Socialist Party: the social-chauvinists, who supported the imperialist policy of the Administration; the Centrists, who opposed the imperialist war only in word; and the revolutionary minority, who took an internationalist stand and carried on a struggle against the war.
The Party’s Left wing, headed by Charles Ruthenberg, William Foster, William Heywood and others, relying on the proletarian elements, waged a struggle against the party’s opportunist lead-ership, for independent proletarian political action and the formation of industrial trade unions based on the principles of the class struggle.
In 1919 a split took place in the Socialist Party.
The breakaway Left wing founded the Communist Party ofthe U.
S.
A.
, of which it formed the core.
The Socialist Party today is a small sectarian organisation.
p.
201 228The Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland (known as the Swiss Socialist Party) was formed in the seventies of the last century and was affiliated to the First International.
The party was re-formed in 1888.
The opportunists were very influential in the party, and during the First World War took a social-chauvinist stand.
In the autumn of 1916 the party’s Right wing broke away to form their own organisation.
The majority, headed by Robert Grimm, took a Centrist social-pacifist stand, while the Left wing took an internationalist stand.
The October Revolu-tion in Russia influenced and strengthened the Left wing, which in December 1920 broke away and in 1921 joined the Communist Party of Switzerland.

202 232The conflict between the Petrograd United Consumers’ Com-mune and the Petrograd Soviet was this.
In the summer of 1920 a number of functionaries of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet headed by G.
Zinoviev and the Petrograd Trade Union Council raised the question of issuing bread rations to workers not only for actual work days but also for holidays and non-working days.
The Board of the Petrograd Commune (A.
Y.
Badayev and others) were opposed to this on the grounds that such an extra issue would violate the very principle on which the work ration was based and that, besides, the necessary supplies for this were lacking; in general, it might upset the regular issue of the work ration and shake the workers’ trust in the food supply system.
The Petrograd Soviet, however, ignored the opinion of the Petrograd Commune Board and announced the issue of rations for holidays.
Badayev refused to carry out this order and declared that the Board of the Petrograd Commune could not work under such conditions.
On July 5, 1920, the Petrograd Gubernia Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
), having discussed “Com-rade Badayev’s refusal to accept the decision of the Large Presid-ium of June 23 providing for an increase in the bread ration, the issue of 5 lb.
advance and the issue of rations to workers during holidays” resolved: “1.
That all district bureaus and all functionaries of the Petrograd Commune shall be ordered to remain at work and discharge their duties without the slightest hitch until further notice from the Petrograd Party Committee and the Executive Committee.
2.
That it be deemed necessary to radically change the personnel of the Petrograd Commune Board and instruct the Bureau of the Gubernia Committee together with the Presidium of the Executive Committee to appoint new comrades through the medium of the Control Council of the Petrograd Commune and to get in touch with Moscow on this question pending the convocation of a city conference of factory committees and unions” (Party Archives of the Party History Institute of the Leningrad Regional Committee of the C.

12, 1920, and Gorky’s letter to H.
G.
Wells published in the same issue.
Both the article and the letter, though inspired by genuine affection for Lenin and admiration for his activities, were written from erroneous positions of the personality cult and contained a number of politically harmful theses.
Gorky gave extremely subjective and virtually idealist appraisals of the role of Lenin and the Russian people, and the nature of the revolution in Russia.
He overlooked the leading role of the Communist Party, the decisive role of the working class and the peasantry in the revo-lution.
Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau of the C.
C.
, R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on July 31, 1920.
The Communist International, organ of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, was published in Russian, German, French, English, Spanish and Chinese.
The first issue appeared on May 1, 1919.
The journal published theoretical articles and documents of the Comintern and a number of articles by Lenin (“The Third International and Its Place in History”, “The Tasks of the Third International”, “Ramsay MacDonald on the Third International”, “Greetings to Italian, French and German Communists”, “The Constituent Assembly Elections and the Dictatorship of the Proletariat”, “Notes of a Publicist” and others).
All member Parties of the Comintern were represented on the journal’s edi-torial board.
The journal dealt with the fundamental questions of Marxist-Leninist theory bearing on the problems of the inter-national labour and communist movements and the experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union.
It also waged a struggle against various anti-Leninist tendencies.
Publication ceased in June 1943 following the decision by the Presidium of the Comintern’s Executive on May 15, 1943, dissolving the Communist International.
p.
205 239The situation on the Polish and Wrangel fronts was discussed at a meeting of the Politbureau on August 19, 1920.
The Wrangel front was found to be the main front, and the Politbureau out-lined a number of measures aimed at strengthening it, speci-fically, it passed a decision to transfer the 6th Division of the First Mounted Army to the Wrangel front.
On August 20, 1920 the Commander-in-Chief forwarded a memo-randum to the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic objecting to this transfer on the grounds that the 6th Division formed the core of the First Mounted Army and in quality was equal to the three remaining divisions.
The memorandum bears J.
V.
Stalin’s superscription: “This information is incorrect: the remaining three divisions have no less than 10,000 sabres, and the 4th Cavalry Division remaining in the Mounted Army is older and more indigenous than the 6th”.
On reading this memorandum Lenin wrote his proposals.
Lenin made the following notes, apparently during the dis-cussion of these proposals: under points 1 and 2 “Krestinsky against”, under point 4 “Krestinsky abstained”, and under point 5 “Krestinsky is for”.
The numeration of the points has been retained as given in the manuscript.
p.
205 240This refers to Order No.
1847 dated August 20, 1920, of the Revo-lutionary Military Council of the Western Front, which stated that the Polish peace delegation consisted entirely of spies and secret service agents and that peace could only be concluded “on the ruins of White Poland”.
p.
206 241On August 23, 1920, the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic rescinded the order of the R.

Danishevsky, head of the Soviet delegation conduct-ing negotiations with Poland, was directed, in the event of the Polish delegation not feeling satisfied with the explanation already given to the delegation at its meeting, to bring to the notice of this delegation the order of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic countermanding that of the R.

206 242The Ninth All-Russia Conference of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) held in Moscow from September 22 to 25, 1920, was attended by 241 delegates (116 of them voting delegates and 125 with a consultative voice) representing 700,000 Party members.
There were delegates from the gubernia organisations of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
and the Ukraine, from the C.
C.
of the Communist Parties of Azerbaijan and Arme-nia.
The Red Army was represented by 34 delegates.
The agenda consisted of the following items: 1) Report by the delegate from the Polish Communists; 2) Political report of the C.
C.
; 3) Organisa-tional report of the C.
C.
; 4) The immediate tasks of Party develop-ment; 5) Report of the Party History Studies Committee; 6) Report on the Second Congress of the Communist International.
Lenin opened the conference with the Central Committee’s political report (see present edition, Vol.
31, pp.
275-79), which dealt mainly with two questions—that of concluding peace with Poland and organising Wrangel’s defeat.
Lenin’s report was followed by heated debates, especially on the causes of the Soviet troops’ setback near Warsaw.
Wind-ing up the debate, Lenin pointed out that the speeches of the delegates provided rich material for drawing necessary lessons and deductions.
The conference unanimously passed a resolution on the terms of peace with Poland, and approved the statement by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee concerning the specific peace terms drawn up under Lenin’s direction and edited by him (see Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, pp.
123-26).
A highlight of the Ninth Conference was the discussion of the question of the immediate tasks of Party development.
Theanti-Party group of “Democratic Centralism” put forward T.
V.
Sapronov as co-reporter to air their views on this question.
They came out against Party discipline and the Party’s guiding role in the Soviets and the trade unions.
The conference, like the Ninth Congress of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
), strongly rebuffed the “Democrat-ic Centralism” group.
The conference adopted a resolution on “The Immediate Tasks of Party Development” drafted and moved by Lenin (see pp.
212-13 of this volume), who also wrote the “Proposals for the Resolution on the Immediate Tasks of Party Development” (see p.
214 of this volume).
The conference called attention to the need for drawing the rank-and-file Communists into wider active participation in the work of gubernia conferences and Gubernia Party Committee ple-nums.
Measures were outlined for eliminating red tape in the work of Government and economic bodies.
To combat various abuses and examine complaints received from Communists, the conference deemed it necessary to set up a Control Commission, and under the gubernia committees—special Party commissions.
On the C.
C.
’s organisational report the conference adopted a resolution to step up the work of the C.
C.

—Polska Partia Socjalistyczna (The Polish Socialist Party)—a reformist nationalist party founded in 1892.
Through-out the party’s history Left-wing groups kept springing up within it as a result of pressure from the rank-and-file workers.
Some of these groups eventually joined the revolutionary wing of the Polish working-class movement.
In 1906 the party split up into the P.
P.
S.
Left wing and the Right, chauvinist wing (the so-called “revolutionary faction”).
Under the influence of the Bolshevik Party and the Social-Demo-cratic Party of Poland and Lithuania, the Left wing gradually adopted a consistent revolutionary stand.
During the First World War a large part of the P.
P.
S.
Left wing adopted an internationalist stand.
In December 1918 it united with the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania to form the Communist Workers’ Party of Poland (as the Commu-nist Party of Poland was known up to 1925).
During the First World War the P.
P.
S.
Right wing continued the policy of national chauvinism, organising Polish legions on the territory of Galicia to fight on the side of Austro-German imperialism.
With the formation of the Polish bourgeois state the Right P.
P.
S.
in 1919 united with the P.
P.
S.
organisations on Polish territories formerly seized by Germany and Austria, and resumed the name of the P.
P.
S.
On becoming the ruling party, it helped transfer power to the Polish bourgeoisie, systematically carried on anti-communist propaganda, and supported a policy of aggression against the Soviet Union, a policy of conquest and oppression against Western Ukraine and Western Byelorussia.
Various groups in the P.
P.
S.
who disagreed with this policy joined the Communist Party of Poland.
After Pilsudski’s fascist coup (May 1926) the P.
P.
S.
was nomi-nally a parliamentary opposition, but actually it carried on no active fight against the fascist regime, and continued its anti-communist and anti-Soviet propaganda.
During that period the Left -wing elements of the P.
P.
S.
collaborated with the Polish Communists and supported united front tactics in a number of campaigns.
During the Second World War the P.
P.
S.
again split up.
Its reactionary and chauvinist faction, which assumed the name Wolno97, Równo97, Niepodleg^o97 (Liberty, Equality, Independ-ence), joined the reactionary Polish émigré “government” in London.
The Left faction, which called itself the Workers’ Party of Polish Socialists, under the influence of the Polish Workers’ Party, which was founded in 1942, joined the popular front against the Nazi invaders, fought for Poland’s liberation, and pursued a policy of friendly relations with the U.
S.

In 1944, after the liberation of Poland’s eastern territories and the formation of a Polish Committee of National Liberation, the Workers’ Party of Polish Socialists resumed the name of P.

215 246 Lenin wrote this at a meeting of the Politbureau on October 9, 1920, when the question of drafting a resolution for the Prolet-cult congress was discussed.
Lenin’s rough draft contains the main theses of his draft resolution on proletarian culture written on the eve, October 8 (see present edition, Vol.
31, pp.
316-17).
Proletcult (Proletarian Culture)—a cultural and educational organisation which arose in September 1917 as an independent workers’ organisation.
Proletcult continued to uphold its “inde-pendence” after the October Revolution, thus setting itself in oppo-sition to the proletarian state.
It shunned the leadership of the Communist Party and insisted on keeping its bodies independent from the Soviet authorities, notably the People’s Commissariat for Education.
Its members virtually denied the cultural legacy of the past, shirked the tasks of cultural and educational work among the masses, and, by isolating themselves from life, aimed at creating a special “proletarian culture” by “laboratory methods”.
Bogdanov, Proletcult’s chief ideologist, paid lip-service to Marxism, but actually expounded subjective idealism, Machism.
Proletcult had a mixed membership.
In addition to bourgeois intellectuals, who held leading positions in many of its organi-sations, the membership included young workers who sincerely wished to promote cultural progress in the Soviet state.
The Communist Party came out strongly against the separat-ist tendencies of Proletcult.
In October 1920 Lenin raised the question of Proletcult before the Politbureau of the Central Committee.
Following the latter’s decision based on Lenin’s draft, the Chief Committee for Political Education drafted instruc-tions governing the relations between Proletcult and the Commis-sariat for Education.
These instructions were endorsed by the plenary meeting of the Central Committee on November 10, 1920.
In 1932 Proletcult ceased to exist.

218 248The Baku Congress of the Peoples of the East (the First Congress of the Peoples of the East) was held in Baku between September 1 and 7, 1920.
It was attended by 1,891 delegates representing 37 nationalities (of the Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Japan, Korea, Syria, Turkey and other countries).
Two-thirds of the delegates (1,273) were Com-munists.
The congress discussed the following questions: 1) The inter-national situation and the tasks of the working peoples of the East; 2) the national and colonial question; 3) the agrarian question; 4) the Soviets in the East; 5) the organisational question and others.
Four sections were formed to prepare the material for the congress: the agrarian, the national and colonial, the Soviet activities, and the organisational sections.
The congress supported the decisions of the Second Congress of the Communist International and drew up a number of res-olutions based on these decisions.
To implement these decisions the congress organised a Council of Propaganda and Action of the Peoples of the East as a permanent body under the Executive Committee of the Comintern.
Speaking of the Second Congress of the Communist Interna-tional and the First Congress of the Peoples of the East, Lenin pointed out: “These were international congresses which united the Communists and showed that in all civilised countries and in all the backward countries of the East, the banner of Bolshe-vism, the programme of Bolshevism, the line of Bolshevik action are an emblem of salvation, an emblem of struggle to the work-ers of all civilised countries and the peasants of all the backward colonial countries.
They showed that, during the past three years, Soviet Russia not only beat off those who fell upon her in order to throttle her, but won the sympathy of the working people of the whole world.

233 276The question of reorganising the work of the People’s Commis-sariat for Education was raised by Lenin in November 1920 (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol.
42, p.
376).
This reorganisation was necessitated by the fact that the activi-ties and structure of the Commissariat did not meet the new tasks in the field of public education arising from the transition to peaceful socialist construction.
In his letter to Lunacharsky dated November 29, 1920 Lenin set forth his preliminary views on this question (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition,Vol.
52, Document 37).
Lenin’s motion calling for the reorgan-isation of the Commissariat for Education was adopted by the C.
C.
plenum on December 8, 1920, with the addition of Point 2, which reads: “The work of the People’s Commissariat for Educa-tion in the sphere of organisation and administrative management on a wide national scale as well as within the apparatus of the Commissariat itself is to be directed by the People’s Commissar only through his assistant.
” p.
237 277On January 26, 1921, the C.
C.
plenum set up a commission headed by Lenin to work out a scheme for the general reorgan-isation of the Commissariat for Education.
On January 28, in a letter to the members of the Board of the Commissariat for Education Lenin asked for urgent information concerning all types of schools together with the text of existing laws govern-ing them (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol.
52, Document 99).
On Lenin’s proposal the Politbureau of the C.

On February 11 the Council of People’s Commissars endorsed the Regulations on the People’s Commissariat for Education drawn up by members of the commission and signed by Lenin.
They were published in Izvestia No.

The congress set up three sections, on industry, agriculture and state organisation, to thrash out these problems.
At the Plenary sessions of the congress Lenin delivered a report on December 22 on the work of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee and the Council of People’s Commissars, and a speech on December 23 winding up the debate on this question.
He also took the floor six times at meetings of the Communist group of the congress (December 21, 22, 24 and 27) on the question of concessions and during the debate of the bill on measures to strengthen and develop peasant farming.

To hold up the advance of the Red Army and prevent a possible collapse of bourgeois Poland and defeat of Wrangel, the British Government sent a Note to Soviet Russia on July 11, 1920, signed by the British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon.
The Note in the form of an ulti-matum demanded that the advance of the Red Army be stopped, that an armistice be concluded with Poland, and that the war with Wrangel should be terminated.
The British Government offered to act as mediator and on behalf of the Allies’ Supreme Council threatened, in the event of the ultimatum being rejected, to assist Poland “with all the means at its disposal”.
In its reply, based on Lenin’s proposals, the Soviet Govern-ment firmly rejected Curzon’s mediation and insisted on direct negotiations with Poland.
The Soviet Government protested against Britain’s attempt to annex the Crimea and agreed to guarantee the personal safety of Wrangel and his troops only on condition that they surrender immediately and completely.

The commission was engaged in preparing questions involving state relations among the Soviet Republics.
p.

Chicherin reported that A.

, which made co-operation between the Republics difficult.
Chicherin expressed the opinion that an agreement should be concluded with Byelorussia similar to that concluded with the Ukraine.
The question of an agreement on alliance between Soviet Byelorussia and the R.

was raised by the Byelorussian Party and administrative bodies in the autumn of 1920.

The session dealt with the question of regulations governing the people’s commissariats.
In the decision on this question the ultimate date was fixed for submitting to the Presidium of the All-Russia C.

p.
268 302On January 26, 1921, the C.

plenum examined the question of Georgia (this question stood third on the agenda, hence Lenin’s heading “To Point 3”).
The discussion of this question followed hostile acts against the Soviet Republic by the Menshevik Govern-ment of Georgia.
In violation of her agreement with the R.

of May 7, 1920, Georgia put a ban on the transit of goods from the R.

On January 26, 1921, thirteen members of Tsektran wrote to the C.
C.
of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) asking to be relieved of their duties as members of the Union’s Central Committee.
One of the reasons given was that criticism of Tsektran’s methods of work during the trade union controversy allegedly created an impression among railwaymen and water transport workers that the Central Committee of the Party censured the whole past and present activities of Tsektran.
The signatories described criticism of the work of Tsektran as persecution on the part of a group of water transport workers as well as of some members of the Party’s C.

At the meeting of the Council of Labour and Defence on February 18 no decision on setting up such a commission was passed.
A shorthand record of the meeting was not kept.
Only Lenin’s brief notes of the debate and his notes for a winding-up speech have come down to us (see Lenin Miscellany XX, pp.
20-22).
Judging by these notes and the article “Integrated Economic Plan” (see Vol.

This question was referred to the Council of People’s Commissars.
The present draft written by Lenin was incorporated com-pletely in the “Regulations on the State Planning Commission” which were endorsed by the C.

The Dashnaks received aid in arms and money from the imperialist Govern-ments of Britain, the U.

They established a regime of terror and tyranny in the areas which they had seized, burning and razing to the ground villages and towns.
The working people of Armenia under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and with the support of units of the 11 t h Army of Soviet troops quelled the revolt, liberated the capital of Armenia, Yerevan, on April 4, 1921 and drove out the Dashnaks.

315The mobilisation of raw material resources was one of the main targets of the Soviet Republic’s economic policy in connection with the plan for rehabilitating industry.
This question was discussed on February 18, 1921, at a meeting of the C.
P.
C.
’s Economic Commission chaired by Lenin.
The commission set up a special body which was to have dealt in detail with the question of collecting raw materials.
The notes published here were apparently made by Lenin during a meeting of the Raw Materials Commission on February 26, 1921.
The question of raw material was further discussed at the C.

307 354Narodnaya Volya—a secret political organisation of Narodnik terrorists, came into being in August 1879.
While subscribing to views of the Narodnik utopian socialism, its members engaged in political struggle, and considered the most important goal to be the overthrow of the autocracy and the winning of political freedom.
They figured on achieving a reorganisation of society without the participation of the people, by means of individual terrorism.
“The Narodnaya Volya members,” wrote Lenin, “made a step forward when they took up the political struggle but they failed to connect it with socialism.

, the British Empire, France, Italy, Japan and other Allied powers.
Describing this treaty in a speech on October 15, 1920, Lenin said, “It is an unparalleled and predatory peace, which has made slaves of tens of millions of people, including the most civilised” (see present edition, Vol.
31, p.
326).
The Versailles Peace Treaty was designed to perpetuate the repartition of the capitalist world in favour of the victor countries, and to establish a system of rela-tionships between countries aimed at strangling Soviet Russia and suppressing the revolutionary movement throughout the world.

308 357The Tenth All-Russia Conference of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) was held in Moscow from May 26 to 28, 1921.
It was attended by 239 delegates from Party and Soviet organisations.
It was a special con-ference.
The following questions were on the agenda: 1) economic policy: a) the tax in kind; b) co-operatives; c) financial reform; d) small industry; 2) the role of the Socialist -Revolutionaries and Mensheviks in the present situation; 3) the Third Congressof the Comintern; 4) information on the Fourth Trade Union Congress; 5) organisational question.
The highlight of the conference was the question of implement-ing the New Economic Policy, on which people in the local areas were not yet quite clear.
Lenin guided the work of the conference.
He delivered the opening speech, spoke on the agenda, made a report on the tax in kind and wound up the debate on this question, and took the floor many times during the discussion of the resolution “On Economic Policy”.
The conference heard supplementary infor-mation by Lenin to the main report on the work of the Fourth Trade Union Congress.
Lenin also made a closing speech.
See p.

358Lenin is referring to the amendment to Point 1 of the draft reso-lution (see present edition, Vol.
32, p.
433).
The mover of this amendment proposed to add the words: “inasmuch as the condi-tions for a world revolution have not changed”.
This amendment was rejected by a majority vote.
p.
309 359Lenin took the floor in connection with a proposed amendment to Point 3 of the draft resolution.
The end of this point read: “Anarchic commodity exchange (that is, exchange which eludes all control and state supervision) to be combated by concentra-tion of exchange chiefly in the hands of the co-operatives, without, however, any restrictions on regular free market operations.
” The mover of the amendment proposed that the end of the sen-tence from the words “without, however” be replaced by the words: “administration by mere injunction in the case of such exchange to be eliminated”.
The amendment was rejected.
p.
310 360Lenin took the floor in connection with a proposed amendment to Point 5 of the draft resolution calling for an extension of the independence and initiative of each large establishment in the matter of disposing of financial and material resources.
The mover of the amendment proposed that this point should apply to the state farms as well.
The amendment was rejected.
p.
311 361This refers to the amendment to Point 9 of the resolution pro-posing the following addendum: “special attention being paid to factual and material initiative and independence of the local areas”.
The amendment was rejected.
p.
311 362This refers to the commission set up for drafting the Instructions of the Council of Labour and Defence to local Soviet bodies.
It was set up by the Council on May 20, 1921.
p.
312 363This refers to the amendment to Point 10 of the draft resolution calling for the establishment of “special responsibility on the part of the central agencies for any hampering of local initiative and insufficient support of it” (see present edition, Vol.
32,p.
435).
The mover of the amendment proposed the following addendum: “stronger punitive measures to be taken against mis-management and misappropriation of state property and wasteful use of labour.
” The amendment was adopted to Point 6 of the resolution.
p.
312 364Point 6 of the draft resolution concerned the regulation of workers’ wages.
p.
312 365Lenin here took the floor in connection with Kiselyov’s proposal that a point be included in the resolution calling for the intro-duction of a system of collective testimonials (by up to 3 people) for persons handling state property, and listing the penalties incurred by the giver of such a testimonial.
The motion was rejected by a majority of votes.
p.
312 366Lenin took the floor here in connection with the proposed amend-ment to Point 2 of the resolution (see present edition, Vol.
32 p.
433).
The mover of the amendment proposed that the reso-lution should state that the tax in kind is brought to the fore in economic activities.
The amendment was rejected.
p.
312 367Lenin’s proposals were adopted at a meeting of the Politbureau on June 21, 1921, as directives for the Party Purge Commission.
They were included, with certain amendments, in the decision of the Politbureau of June 25 concerning the check-up, revision and purge of the Party.
In connection with the drafting of this decision Lenin jotted down notes concerning the conditions of admission to the Party (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol.
43, p.
362).
Lenin’s remarks were also taken into consideration in the decision adopted by the Central Committee.
p.
315 368The Third Congress of the Communist International was held in Moscow from June 22 to July 12, 1921.
It was attended by 605 delegates (291 voting delegates and 314 with a consultative voice) representing 103 organisations from 52 countries, namely: 48 Communist Parties, 8 Socialist Parties, 28 Youth Leagues 4 syndicalist organisations, 2 opposition Communist Parties (the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany and the Workers’ Communist Party of Spain) and 13 other organisations.
The 72 delegates from the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) were headed by Lenin.
The congress discussed the world economic crisis and the new tasks of the Communist International; the report on the activity of the Executive Committee of the Communist Inter-national; the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany; the Italian question; the tactics of the Communist International; the attitude of the Red International Council of Trade Unions to the Commu-nist International; the struggle against the Amsterdam International; the tactics of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
); the Communist International and the Communist youth movement; the women’smovement; the United Communist Party of Germany, and other questions.
All the work of preparing for the congress and conducting its activities was directed by Lenin.
He wrote the “Theses for a Report on the Tactics of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
)” which were adopted by the congress; he spoke on the Italian question; in defence of the tactics of the Communist International; delivered a report on the tactics of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
); took a leading part in drafting all the key resolutions; spoke in the committees and at the enlarged sittings of the Executive Committee of the Comintern and at the delegates’ meetings.
See present edition, Vol.
32, pp.
451-96.
The “Theses on the Organisational Activities of the Communist Parties, on the Methods and Content of Their Work” for the Third Congress of the Communist International were drafted by O.
W.
Kuusinen.
On June 6, 1921, he sent Lenin part of the article he had written on the organisational question and the theses on which the article was based.
In accordance with Lenin’s remarks Kuusinen redrafted the theses and sent them again to Lenin on June 17 (without points 25-29 dealing with the Party press); on June 21 the rest of the theses were sent (points 25-29).
Apparently Lenin read this variant of the theses again.
On June 27 Kuusinen sent Lenin a third variant of the theses on the organisa-tional question revised on the basis of Lenin’s instructions.
The theses were revised also with the co-operation of the German Communist Wilhelm Koenen.
On July 9 Lenin approved the theses and gave his final remarks and addenda to them.
(see pp.
318-19 of this volume).
After discussion in the Committee the theses, with slight amendments, were adopted on July 12 by the Third Congress of the Communist International (see The Communist International in Documents.

The work of drafting the theses was entrusted to the Russian delegation to the congress.
p.
318On June 1, 1921, K.
B.
Radek sent Lenin a draft of the theses containing amendments proposed by A.
Thalheimer and Béla Kun and their own draft.
On the envelope containing these materials Lenin jotted down his initial remarks on the draft theses on tactics (see Collected Works, Vol.
44, Fifth Russian Edition, p.
435) and then wrote out his remarks in full as printed lower down.
In accordance with Lenin’s directions the draft theses on tactics were revised, discussed at preliminary meetings with a number of delegations and tabled at the Third Congress in the name of the Russian delegation.
On July 1, Lenin delivered a speech at the congress in defence of the tactics of the Comintern (see present edition, Vol.
32, pp.
468-77).
On July 12, the theses were unanimously adopted by the congress (see The Communist International in Documents, etc.
Moscow, 1933, pp.

p.
319 373The Open Letter (Offener Brief) of the Central Committee of the United Communist Party of Germany to the Socialist Party of Germany, the Independent Social-Democratic Party of Ger-many, the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany and all trade unions was published in Die Rote Fahne on January 8, 1921.
The U.
C.
P.
G.
called on all workers, trade unions and socialist organisations to unite their forces in combating the growing reaction and the capitalists’ attack upon the working people’s vital rights.
Their programme of joint action included demands for higher pensions for disabled war veterans; elimination of unemployment; improvement of the country’s finances at the expense of the monopolies; introduction of factory committee control over all stocks of food, raw materials and fuel; restarting of all closed enterprises; control over sowing, harvesting and marketing of all farm produce by the Peasants’ Councils together with the agricultural labourers’ organisations; immediate dis-arming and disbanding of all bourgeois militarised organisations; establishment of workers’ self-defence; amnesty for all political prisoners; immediate resumption of trade and diplomatic rela-tions with Soviet Russia.
Lenin commented very favourably on the Open Letter (see Lenin Miscellany XXXVI, p.
221).
The Right -wing leaders of the organisations to which the Open Letter was addressed rejected the proposal for joint action with the Communists, despite the fact that the workers came out for a united front of the proletariat.
p.
321 374KAPD (Kommunistische Arbeiter Partei Deutschlands)—Commu-nist Workers’ Party of Germany, was formed in April 1920 by “Left” Communists, who had been expelled from the Communist Party of Germany at the Heidelberg Congress in 1919.
In Novem-ber 1920, in order to facilitate the unification of all German communist forces and meet the wishes of the best proletarian elements within it, the C.
W.
P.
G.
was temporarily admitted into the Comintern with the rights of a sympathising member.
The Executive Committee of the Comintern, however, still regardedthe United Communist Party of Germany as the only fully-authorised section of the Comintern.
C.
W.
P.
G.
’s representatives were admitted into the Comintern on the condition that they merged with the United Communist Party of Germany and support-ed all its activities.
The Third Congress of the Comintern, in order to win over the workers who still followed the lead of the C.
W.
P.
G.
, decided to give the latter two to three months to call a congress and settle the question of amalgamation.
The Execu-tive Committee, on behalf of the Third Congress, adopted an appeal “To the Members of the Communist Workers’ Party of Germany” setting forth the decision of the congress and urging the C.
W.
P.
G.
to abandon its sectarian policy and unite with the U.
C.
P.
G.
The C.
W.
P.
G.
leadership failed to comply with the decision of the Third Congress and continued their splitting activities: The Executive of the Comintern was compelled to break off relations with the party.
The C.
W.
P.

thus found itself outside the Communist International.
Eventually the C.

degenerated into a small sectarian group having no support among, and hostile to, the working class of Germany.
p.
321 375The Italian question was referred to the Third Congress of the Comintern following the protest of the Italian Socialist Party against the decision of the Comintern’s Executive to exclude it from the Communist International and recognise the Communist Party of Italy as the only section of the Comintern in Italy.
The Third Congress of the Communist International adopted the following decision on thee I.
S.
P.
on June 29, 1921: “The Italian Socialist Party cannot belong to the Communist Interna-tional so long as the participants of the reformists’ conference at Reggio-Emilia and their supporters have not been expelled from the party.
“In the event of this preliminary condition being fulfilled the Third World Congress will authorise its Executive to take the necessary steps to bring about a union between the Italian Social-ist Party, after it has cleared its ranks of all reformist and Cen-trist elements, and the Communist Party of Italy, and transform both organisations into a unified section of the Communist Inter-national” (The Communist International in Documents.
Decisions, Theses and Appeals of the Congresses of the Comintern and Plenary Meetings of the Executive Committee of the Communist Interna-tional.
1919 -1 9 3 .
Moscow, 1933, p.
164).
The Italian Socialist Party, however, failed to carry out this decision of the Third Congress.
A Left faction of “Third-Internationalists” (G.
M.
Serrati, F.
Maffi and others) was formed within the Italian Socialist Party in the spring of 1923, which was for amalgamation with the Communist Party of Italy.
In August 1924 the Third Interna-tionalists merged with the Communist Party of Italy.
p.
322 376Lenin is apparently referring to the following text of the initial draft theses on the question of the tactics of the CommunistInternational submitted by K.
B.
Radek: “Seeing that the Commu-nist International wishes to create only truly revolutionary mass parties, they [what Radek calls Centrist groups in the Commu-nist Parties of a number of countries.
—Ed.
] are making a big noise about the Comintern falling into sectarianism.
This is what the Levi group in Germany, the "meral group in Czechoslo-vakia, etc.
, are doing.
The nature of these groups is quite clear.
They are Centrist groups, who cloak the policy of passive waiting for the revolution with communist phrases and theories.
The "meral group put off the organisation of a Communist Party in Czechoslovakia at a time when the majority of the Czechoslo-vak workers had taken a communist stand” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.
C.
of the C.
P.
S.
U.
).
p.
323 377B.
"meral’s report at the Inaugural Congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was published in abridged form in the newspaper Vorwärts, around which were grouped the Czechoslo-vak Lefts headed by K.
Kreibich.
Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Tactics Committee.
The section of the theses on tactics dealing with the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia was worded in accordance with his proposal.
p.
324 378At the beginning of July 1921 the employees of Berlin’s muni-cipal services decided to call a strike for higher pay.
The strike was decided on by a majority of the workers (about 80,000).
The reformists, however, succeeded in preventing the strike.
Following negotiations between the representatives of the employees and the Berlin Municipal Council, on which sat Social-Democrats, the employees’ pay was slightly raised.
p.
326 379Early in July 1921 the cotton-mill workers of Lille (France) went on strike against wage cuts by the mill-owners.
The strike spread to a number of departments.
Early in September the workers of the Northern district of France declared a general strike.
Although the workers staunchly carried on the fight for two months, the strike failed as a result of the reformist tactics of the trade union leadership and unfavourable economic condi-tions.
p.
326 380The mass meeting of the workers in Rome, which was held on July 8, 1921, was fully reported in Pravda No.
149 on July 10, 1921.
p.
326 381The draft decision on collective pay for employees of state institutions was discussed in the C.
P.
C.
on June 14, 21, 24 and 28 and July 8, 1921.
The system of collective supply was designed to replace that of individual supply by ration coupons and lists as well as bonuses paid in kind.
The workers and office employees received remuneration exclusively in the form of wages and salaries, the amount of which was fixed for each enterprise asa whole, i.
e.
, collectively for all the workers and office staffs.
On June 24 the C.
P.
C.
passed a decision adopting the system of collective pay for employees of state institutions in Moscow and Petrograd as from July 1 and in the remaining districts of the Republic not earlier than September 1, and set up a commission to complete “the draft in order to determine, on the basis of at least limited approximate data, what the number of Soviet employees will be after the reduction and what their pay is in money and in kind”.
On June 28, 1921, the C.
P.
C.
, following reports by A.
B.
Khalatov and L.
I.
Ginsburg, passed its decision on collective pay for employees in state institutions with amend-ments to Point “A” proposed by Lenin and with his wording of Point “D”.
The final text of the Council’s decision was adopted on July 8, 1921.
p.
329 382Lenin’s motion was made in connection with the decision of the Politbureau, adopted on the report of A.
S.
Kiselyov on July 7, 1921, “On Speeding Up the Transition of Enterprises and Insti-tutions to a Self-Supporting System of Operation”.
The decision stated: “Soviet institutions shall be directed to take more ener-getic steps towards switching over both separate enterprises and Soviet institutions to a self-supporting system of operation.
” p.
329 383In view of the famine that attacked the Volga region and south Ukraine in 1921, the Politbureau on July 9, 1921, passed a decision for the transfer of a maximum number of Communists to food supply work.
Lenin’s “Notes” were written apparently in preparation for the discussion of this question at the meeting of the Politbureau.
p.
330 384The question of Centrosoyuz was discussed at a meeting of the C.
P.
C.
on July 15, 1921 which heard reports by L.

Khinchuk “On the Organisation of Commodity Exchange and the Need for Speeding Up and Expanding Work in This Direction” and N.
P.
Bryukhanov “On Supervision Over Centrosoyuz in Pursuance of the Decision of the Council of People’s Commissars of June 14, 1921, With a View to Obtaining the Maximum Amount of Grain Through Commodity Exchange”.
A single resolution was adopted on both reports incorporating Lenin’s proposals.
p.
332 385This motion was drafted in connection with the theses of the Siberian Bureau of the Central Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) and the Siberian Revolutionary Committee “On the Forms of Organisation of Siberian Soviet Institutions and Siberian Party Bodies”.
The theses put the case for the necessity of having in Siberia a regional Soviet centre with corresponding economic and military departments, an agency of the Vecheka and a regional Party centre.
Both these centres, in the view of the Siberian Bureau and Siberian Revolutionary Committee, were to be built on the principle of appointment.
The covering memorandum stated that the question would be discussed at the forthcoming Fourth Siberian Regional Party Conference at which spokesmen of two trends were expected to state their views: one, which denied the need for Siberian regional centres, and the other, which recognised the need for their creation on the elective principle.
The theses of the Siberian Bureau were endorsed as a whole by the Orgbureau of the C.
C.
on July 29, 1921.
Points 4 and 5 in the manuscript were crossed out by Lenin.
p.
332 386The Central Committee plenum considered the question of the state of transport on August 8, 1921, and endorsed the conclu-sions of F.
E.
Dzerzhinsky with the amendments proposed by Lenin.
Point 1 of the conclusions referred to the need for all Party and administrative bodies to devise measures for improving and assisting transport.
Points 2-4 called for reinforcement of the apparatus of the Com-missariat for Railways with top-level executives, the issue of a circular to all Gubernia Committees of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) concern-ing the state of transport, and the organisation of a transport subdepartment in the C.
C.
’s Organisation and Instruction Department to take charge of Party work on the railways.
Point 5 of the conclusions called for all transport servicing enterprises being turned over to the People’s Commissariat for Railways.
p.
333 387The question of setting up an information bureau abroad to collect material on the international labour movement was discussed at the Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Comintern on August 17, 1921.
Lenin’s proposal was adopted.
Shortly afterwards E.
Varga sent Lenin his project for the “Organisation of Information in the Comintern Executive”.
This called for the establishment of an Information Institute which would supply the Comintern Executive with the necessary material.
The project suggested methods of work for the Insti-tute and outlined instructions for compiling socio-economic reports and political information.
On August 31, 1921, Lenin sent Varga his remarks on the project—“Tentative Amendments or Theses” (see pp.
337-39 of this volume).
Lenin’s letter of September 1, 1921 (see p.
339 of this volume) was a reply to Varga’s letter dated August 31, 1921, on the subject of Lenin’s theses on the organisation of an Information Institute, in which Varga reported that there were “deep-going basic differences in regard to the aims of such an Institute”.
Trotsky, Zinoviev and Radek, wrote Varga, considered that this Institute was designed primarily to supply information for the internal use of the Comintern Executive.
“In your theses, on the other hand, the weight of emphasis seems to be on press information on the labour movement in Central Europe, whereas information forthe Comintern Executive is relegated to the background.
This change of aim affects all other changes (legality, complete inde-pendence of the Comintern)”.
“Consequently, it would be neces-sary to decide in principle: is the aim of the Institute to be: a) information for the Comintern Executive? b) influencing the labour press by its publications? c) linking both aims? All questions of organisation depend, it seems to me, on the solution of this question” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.
C.
, C.
P.
S.
U.
).
The plan for setting up an Information Institute did not materialise.
p.
336 388This draft was written on the letter of I.
S.
Unschlicht, Deputy Chairman of the Vecheka, to the Central Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.

Please give me your instruc-tions on the following: 1) should such a report be made at all; 2) if it should, then in what direction” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau at its meeting on August 25, 1921.
p.
336 389This motion was written in connection with a telegram from the Chairman of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee I.
N.
Smir-nov dated August 26, 1921, reporting the arrest of Baron Ungern.
The Politbureau adopted Lenin’s motion.
The trial of Baron Ungern took place on September 15.
During the hearing a long list of atrocities committed by Ungern and his underlings was revealed.
On capturing Urgu (now Ulan-Bator) he ordered all the employees of Centrosoyuz and the Town Council to be shot.
On his orders the peaceful inhabitants were robbed and killed and the town was burnt down.
The trial brought to light Baron Ungern’s ties with the Chinese militarists (Chang Tso-lin) and Japanese interventionists.
Baron Ungern was sentenced to death.
p.
336 390E.
Varga’s project for the “Organisation of Information in the Comintern Executive” contained two appendixes: “Appendix A—Instructions on Compiling Socio-Economic Reports” and “Appendix B—Instructions on Compiling Reports on the Political Situation Within the Country”.
The instructions under Appendix A covered: 1.
The purpose of the reports, which was to give a dynamic picture of the development of the revolutionary movement in the country and its analysis.
2.
Four factors conditioning revolutionary development: a) the Communist Party—the motive force of the revolutionary movement; b) the proletariat—the revolutionary masses; c) the ruling classes—the enemy;d) the petty-bourgeois middle strata.
The report must show the alignment of forces.
3.
The starting-point should be an account of the economic situation, the social position of the proletariat and the middle strata.
4.
The report should consist of a brief review (5-10 pages) with a detailed appendix to it.
The instructions under Appendix B contained the following sections: 1) Communist Parties; II) non-communist proletarian parties; III) bourgeois parties; IV) organisation of the armed forces.
Lenin refers to §§ 3 and 4 of Section I (“Communist Parties”) of Varga’s instructions (Appendix B) which deal with legal and illegal Party cells, the promulgation of Party literature, appeals, pamphlets and books and the issue of illegal Party literature.
p.
338 391Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on September 2, 1921.
The next day, September 3, Lenin wrote to the Secre-tary of the Comintern Executive asking him to arrange for the collection of information about workers’ donations in Europe for the relief of the famine-stricken areas in Russia (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol.
53, Document 270).
For Soviet press reports on moneys collected among the interna-tional proletariat see Document 345 of the same volume.
p.
340 392Under the pretence of rendering relief to the famine-stricken areas in Russia the imperialists organised an “International Com-mission” headed by Noulens, the former French Ambassador to Russia and one of the chief organisers of counter-revolutionary plots and military intervention against Soviet Russia.
The com-mission was made up of former French, English, and Belgian diplo-mats and big foreign owners of enterprises that had been nation-alised in Russia.
On September 4, 1921, the Noulens Commission sent a telegram to the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs demanding that thirty experts be admitted into Soviet Russia for on-the-spot investigations under a special programme pro-viding for the collection of information of an intelligence nature.
On September 6 the Politbureau approved, with slight amend-ments, the text of a Note to Noulens drafted in accordance with Lenin’s proposals.
The answering Note of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, published in Izvestia on September 8, stated that “ Mr.
Noulens’ Commission, in lieu of relief for the famine-stricken areas, planned to collect information on the internal position of Soviet Russia .
.
.
and this was to be done under the guidance of people who had already engaged in such a study with the undisguised aim of engineering revolts and facilitating the advance of foreign armies on the territory of the U.
S.

The Soviet Government emphatically refused to permit entry of the Noulens Commission into the Soviet Republic.

341393Owing to food difficulties, the crop failure and the need for ren-dering relief to the famine-stricken areas, the Politbureau on Sep-tember 6, 1921, adopted a decision on directives to the Food Commissariat with Lenin’s amendments.
The directives provided for a reduction in the number of recipients of state food supplies as from October 1921, and the establishment of a grain fund.

Point 4 was crossed out by Lenin and not included in the decision of the Politbureau.
The question of book sales was re-examined by the Politbureau at its meeting on October 15, at which it confirmed its decision of September 13 and outlined concrete practical measures for its implementation; special attention was given to measures for preventing all kinds of anti-Soviet literature from getting into the book trade.

P.
(B.
) “On Problems of Party Development”.
It was preceded by long and careful pre-paration.
On June 21, 1921, the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission adopted a Decision on Checking, Revising and Purging the Party (see Pravda No.
146 for June 30, 1921), which fixed the date for the purge to be carried out (from August 1 to October 1, 1921), stipulated that working people, both Communists and non-Party, were to be questioned concern-ing members of the Party who were being checked, and defined the procedure for setting up local verification commissions.
During the period of the purge admission into the Party was suspended, an exception being made in the case of workers and peasants who did not exploit outside labour.
On July 7 the Politbureau endorsed a Central Verification Commission for checking the Party membership and local verification commissions.
The Central Committee of the Party addressed a letter “To All Party Organisations.
On the Purging of the Party” (see Pravda No.
163 for July 27, 1921) setting forth the aims and methods of the purge.
The C.
C.
recommended the following guidelines: a more indulgent attitude towards workers in the matter of pre-senting documents, testimonials, etc.
As regards peasants, a clear line should be drawn between kulak and proprietary elements and honest working peasants.
A stricter approach to “commis-sarified” elements, to those holding posts which involve any priv-ileges.
An especially strict check to be applied to former govern-ment officials and bourgeois intellectuals.
And strictest of all to former members of other parties, particularly the Mensheviksand Socialist -Revolutionaries.
The start of the purge was put off until August 15.
As a result of the purge, which continued up till the Eleventh Congress of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) about 25 per cent of the membership were expelled from the Party.
This improved the Party’s social composition, strengthened discipline, gave the Party greater prestige among the non-Party worker and peasant masses and freed the Party from elements who discredited it.
The Party’s-ideological and organisational unity was enhanced.

’s decisions.
The “Report of the Central Committee of the R.
C.
P.
” for Sep-tember 1921 states that the C.
C.
passed two decisions concerning the procedure for recommending members of the R.
C.
P.
during the purge.
One stated: “Only those comrades have the right to recommend who have known the recommended person not less than one year and have worked with him or observed his work in one or another Party organisation”.
The other decision spoke about the responsibility of the recommenders for the recommended (see Izvestia of the C.

C.
P.
(B.
) No.
35, Decem-ber 1, 1921).
p.
344 399In 1921 various groups of American workers united around the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia expressed a desire to go to Soviet Russia to lend a hand in economic construction.
Most of these workers were Russian emigrants who had gone to America before the October Revolution.
On June 22, 1921, the Council of Labour and Defence discussed the question of enlisting the services of members of the indus-trial emigrant community, and recognised the desirability of “developing individual industrial enterprises or groups of enter-prises by handing them over to groups of American workers and industrially developed farmers on a contract basis ensuring them a definite degree of economic autonomy” (Lenin Miscellany XX, p.
202).
The Council also considered it necessary to regulate industrial immigration of workers from foreign countries.
On August 11, 1921, a telegram signed by Lenin was sent to the Society for Technical Aid to Soviet Russia, stating, among other things: “You must bear in mind the hardships existing in Russia, the difficulties in connection with the food supply problem, and other obstacles which would have to be faced.
Persons going to Russia should be prepared to meet these conditions.

In the latter part of 1921 a group of American workers headed by S.
Rutgers, a Dutch engineer and Communist, W.
D.
Hey-wood, a prominent leader of the American labour movement and G.
S.
Calvert, an American worker, carried on negotiations with the Soviet Government for exploitation by this group ofa part of the Kuznetsk coal-field in Siberia and the organisation there of an industrial colony.
Lenin received delegates of the American workers’ colony on September 19 and had a talk with them.
A record of this talk, made by Lenin, is given in Lenin Miscellany XXIII, p.
39.
Lenin’s draft engagement was written in connection with this talk.

400In a letter to the Politbureau dated October 7, 1921, G.
V.
Chicherin, People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, wrote that the Government of the Far-Eastern Republic wished to be briefed by the Politbureau on the following points: 1) Is recognition of the F.
-E.
R.
by Japan and America desirable in the absence of simultaneous recognition by them of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
; 2) Should the offer by foreigners to grant state loans to the F.
-E.
R.
be accepted; 3) Is the F.
-E.
R.
independent of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
in fact as well as in form.
In the opinion of the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs these questions were to be answered in the following manner: 1) Recognition of the F.
-E.
R.
is desirable, but without the structure of the F.
-E.
R.
being specified in the agreement; 2) Foreign loans are useful provided the sovereign rights of the F.
-E.
R.
are preserved; 3) The F.
-E.
R.
is to be considered independent of the R.
S.
F.
S.

Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on October 8, 1921.
The draft directives to the F.

” p.
347 405This draft was written in preparation for the meeting of the Politbureau on the question of an agreement with the group of American workers and engineers headed by S.
Rutgers, who had arrived in Russia (see Note 399).
On September 23, 1921, the C.
L.
D.
discussed the proposal of the Rutgers group for the Nadezhdinsk Works and a number of enterprises of the Kuznetsk coal-field to be turned over to them for exploitation, and found it desirable to conclude an agreement, the final terms of which were to be drafted by a commission con-sisting of representatives of the S.
E.
C.
, the Commissariat for Labour and the Commissariat for Agriculture.
Lenin took part in the negotiations with the Rutgers group and made a number of proposals in connection with the terms of the agreement (see pp.
348-50, 352-53 of this volume, and Collected Works, Vol.
53, Fifth Russian Edition, pp.
260-61, 302-03).
The agreement with the sponsor group (the Rutgers group) of the American workers, which was signed on October 20, was endorsed by the C.
L.
D.
on October 21 and by the C.
P.
C.
on October 25.
In November the Soviet Government signed a con-tract with this group, under which the American workers were to bring with them a definite quantity of tools, materials and foodstuffs, while the Soviet Government assigned a sum of $300,000 for the purchase abroad of machines and equipment.
Under the terms of this contract an Autonomous Industrial Colony directly subordinated to the C.
L.
D.
was set up in part p.
348 of the territory of the Kuznetsk coal-field.
406Lenin’s proposals formed the basis of the Politbureau’s decision of October 15, 1921, concerning the proposals of S.
Rutgers, and the Council of Labour and Defence decision of October 17, 1921, “On the Terms of an Agreement with the Rutgers Group”.
p.
350 407Lenin’s draft was adopted at the meeting of the Politbureau on October 14, 1921.
After hearing the opinion of the Central Control Commission and the Central Verification Commission on the question of assigning Shlyapnikov to food supply work, the Politbureau ruled on October 27: “The period of Comrade Shlyapnikov’s work on food supply should be fixed at two months, counting from the date of his departure” (Central Party Archives Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.
C.
of the C.
P.

The Central Verification Commission, consisting of five members, was set up for the period of the Party purge to direct the work of the local verification commissions (see Pravda No.
146, June 30, 1921).
p.
350 408There having been certain differences of opinion among leading members of the Baku Party organisation and the central organi-sations of Azerbaijan in applying the national policy, the Central Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) issued instructions for the greatest discretion to be shown by Party workers in Azerbaijan towards the mode of life and way of thinking among the Moslem popula-tion.
All functionaries of the Azerbaijan Communist Party were directed to take this into consideration in all their activities and strive towards teamwork and co-operation and not allow any factions to be formed within the Party organisation.
Lenin’s proposals were included in the decision of the C.
C.
’s Politbureau adopted October 15, 1921.
The directives on the implementation of the Communist Party’s national policy in Azerbaijan drafted by J.
V.
Stalin were endorsed by the Politbureau on October 17.

352 411The A.
R.
A.
(American Relief Administration)—was formed in 1919 to render relief to the population who had suffered from the First World War.
The President of the A.
R.
A.
was Herbert Hoover, a big capitalist, who had had close links with Russian capital before 1917.
Some of the A.
R.
A.
staff engaged in charitable work with all sincerity and conscientiousness, but the A.
R.
A.
as a whole served as an instrument for spreading the influence of American imperialism and dumping old stocks.
On October 18, 1921, the draft of an agreement with the A.
R.
A on the organisation of food parcels to Russia was circulated for voting among members of the Politbureau.
The covering letter has the signatures of Politbureau members and a proposal by Stalin that a charge be made for transportation of the parcels from the frontier to the distributing warehouses, and for their storage, since, in his opinion, this was a commercial operation, not charity.
Lenin’s bracketed remark was made in connection with this proposal.
The draft agreement with the A.
R.
A.
was endorsed by the Politbureau on October 19, 1921.
The Soviet Government accepted A.
R.
A.
assistance in con-nection with famine on the Volga and in south Ukraine in 1921 but repelled its attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet Republic and established control over its activities.
As subsequent events proved, the A.

personnel, consisting chiefly of American army officers, engaged in espionage and supported counter-revolutionary elements.
The A.

and the regional and gubernia economic conferences with a right to vote.
The Politbureau rejected this request and adopted Lenin’s motion.

355 413The question of manufacturing Fowler-type motor ploughs was considered repeatedly by the Council of Labour and Defence.
The Metal Department of the Supreme Economic Council, which had been charged with the manufacture of these ploughs in May 1920, drew up a production plan without taking into account available metal and fuel resources.
The Special Three-Man Commission set up to combine all production of ploughs did not inform the C.
L.
D.
or the C.
P.
C.
as to the actual state of affairs.
This draft decision was adopted at the meeting of the C.
L.
D.
on October 21, 1921.
The case of red tape was brought before the Moscow Military Tribunal, which found a number of mem-bers of the staffs of the S.
E.
C.
and the Commissariat for Agri-culture guilty of negligence.
Considering these men’s services in the matter of economic reconstruction, however, the Tribunal decided not to punish them.
At the suggestion of the Moscow Military Tribunal the C.
L.
D.
reprimanded the Presidium of the S.
E.
C.
and the Board of the Commissariat for Agriculture for giving insufficient attention to the production of Fowler ploughs.

32, pp.
375-98) Lenin wrote a letter to the editors of Izvestia, Pravda, Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn and other newspapers on July 21 pointing out the importance of “explaining in detail the significance which the local economic conferences and the publication of reports for general informa-tion has for both the application of the New Economic Policy in general and for proper economic construction” (Collected Works, Vol.
53, Fifth Russian Edition, p.
52).
When reports started coming in from the local areas, Lenin raised the question of studying and utilising these reports.

On his advice and suggestion a draft decision was drawn up, which was en-dorsed by the Council of Labour and Defence on November 21, 1921.
This decision took into account all Lenin’s remarks.
He attached special importance to having people appointed in the various commissariats and other institutions who were really interested in and understood the importance of studying the local reports” (Vospominaniya o Vladimire Ilyiche Lenine [Remi-niscences of Lenin], Part 3, Moscow, 1961, p.

He lent an attentive ear to our stories, showed a lively interest in the most varied aspects of life in people’s Mongolia, and gave some useful advice.
In particular, he drew our attention to the need for raising the level of education and culture among the Mongolian people, while at the same time stressing the need for developing the country’s economy to the utmost with a view to meeting all the requirements of the people.

360 421 The First All-Russia Conference on Trade Union Cultural and Educational Work was held in Moscow from September 26 to October 1, 1921.
It was attended by 173 delegates (122 voting delegates and 51 with a consultative voice), of whom 119 were Communists, 51 non-Party people, 1 Menshevik, 1 Socialist -Revolutionary and 1 inter-party socialist.
There were 13 items on the agenda of the conference, which included reports of the A.
C.
C.
T.
U.
’s Culture Department, the Peoples’ Commissariat for Education and its chief administrations, and Proletcult; reports from the local areas (Donbas, Petrograd, Baku); the New Economic Policy and education; the trade union’s work of polit -ical education; cultural work among the youth, and other items.
The conference mapped out ways for improving the trade unions’ work of political education, and new forms and methods under the New Economic Policy (cultural work at private and leased enterprises, and so on).
The conference adopted a wrong stand on the question of rela-tions with the Chief Committee for Political Education.
Its resolution (“Role and Aims of the Trade Unions’ Cultural Work”) contained a demand that the trade unions’ cultural work should be freed from the influence of the Chief Committee for Political Education.
This ran counter to the resolution of the Tenth Con-gress of the R.
C.
P.
“On the Chief Committee for Political Educa-tion and the Agitation and Propaganda Tasks of the Party” (see The C.

“The trade unions,” ran this resolution, “constantly lapse into the entirely erroneous view that educational work in all forms should be the business of the trade unions, that the trade unions would be better able to con-duct the business of education than the educational authorities.
“Their point of view is erroneous and stems from misinter-pretation of the tasks of the trade unions.
Adherence to such a point of view would induce the conclusion that all state func-tions, the work of all the commissariats, should be turned over to the trade unions” (Second All-Russia Congress of Political Education Departments.

438The Ninth All-Russia Congress of Soviets sat in Moscow on Decem-ber 23-28, 1921.
It was attended by 1,993 delegates, of whom 1,631 were voting delegates and 362 had a consultative voice.
1,850 delegates were Communists, 139 non-Party people, and one delegate each with a consultative voice from the Socialist -Revolutionaries, the Anarcho-Universalists, the Jewish Social-Democratic Labour Party Poale Zion and the Molokan com-munities.

Lenin put in a great deal of work in preparing for the congress and directing its proceedings (see present edition, Vol.
33, pp.
141-81).
The Meeting of Non-Party Delegates held on the evening of December 26, 1921, discussed two questions: that of the com-pulsory carting tax (reporter Lemberg, representative of the Commissariat for Labour), and the agrarian question.
The meet-ing was chaired by M.
I.
Kalinin.
The first two speeches were delivered by Lenin during the discussion of the carting tax question, the second speech follow-ing a request by one of the congress delegates asking Lenin to say a few words “about the servicing of Soviet institutions”.
Lenin’s third speech was delivered during the discussion of the agrarian question following a speech by Kalinin.
Lenin made brief notes of the speeches at the meeting (see Lenin Miscellany p.

Excuse me, Comrades, but a beard means a lot to a peasant.
It stands for his way of life, his thinking, and the best example is the peasant Petrushkin sitting here next to me.
If Comrade Lenin says, ‘I’ll go and burn all the prayer-books’, I’d like to know the opinion of a non-Party man, and I’ll ask Petrushkin what the peasants will think of my wanting to burn the prayer-books.
He’ll say, ‘Who cares, let them burn’.
He’s a young man, but if I ask a bearded man he’ll say we ought to wait a bit.
This means a lot to us” (Istorichesky Arkhiv [Historical Archives], No.

374 442 Pravda for January 3, 1922, published a news-item reporting the “Suicide of Engineer Oldenborger” which stated: “The Mos-cow Soviet, in agreement with the Moscow Committee of the R.
C.
P.
, appointed a special commission to investigate the causes of the suicide of V.
V.
Oldenborger, Chief Engineer of the Mos-cow Municipal Waterworks.
The Commission found that the deceased was not only a highly skilled employee, but a man utterly devoted to his work.
The cause of suicide were the dif-ficult conditions, which interfered with the daily routine of Olden-borger’s work.
Some of the members of the Waterworks Special Trio, instead of trying to improve things at Moscow’s Water-works, made them more difficult and complicated than ever; Engineer Semyonov, Chief Inspector of the People’s Commis-sariat for Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, who is a member of this Trio, was rude, cavilling and bureaucratic in his relations with Oldenborger; Makarov-Zemlyansky, Chief Inspector of the same commissariat and a former clerk at the Waterworks, carried on a ceaseless persecution of Oldenborger; and Yelagin and Merkulov, workers of the Alexeyevsk Pump-House, accused Oldenborger groundlessly of technical disorganisation of the Waterworks and of an attitude of disrespect towards the commu-nist group on the part of the employees.
All this was bound to have its effect on the emotional state of the deceased.
The commis-sion considers the continued employment of Makarov-Zemlyansky impermissible not only in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspec-tion, but in Soviet service generally, as being a person who is alien to the spirit of Soviet service, an intrigant who has earned among the employees of the Waterworks the reputation of being a dishonest man.
The commission also found that engineer Semyo-nov of the W.
P.
I.
should not be allowed to continue work at the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection or to have anything to do with the Moscow Municipal Waterworks, and likewise considers it necessary that Yelagin and Merkulov should be dismissed from the Waterworks and transferred to some other enterprise.

443Lenin’s proposal that a commission be set up to check and replace some of the leading personnel in the trade unions was based on the fact that the trade unions were honeycombed with former Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries and that it was necessary to fix a longer record of Communist Party membership for leading trade union officials in keeping with the resolution of the Eleventh All-Russia Conference of the R.

In a conversation, with A.
V.
Lunacharsky in February 1922 Lenin “once more stressed the necessity of establishing a definite proportion between entertainment films and scientific films”.
Vladimir Ilyich, Lunacharsky writes in his reminiscences, said that the production of new films imbued with communist ideas and reflecting Soviet realities should be started with newsreel,since, in his opinion, the time had not yet come for the production of such films.
“ If you have a good newsreel, serious and enlightening pictures, it doesn’t really matter if you show some worthless film with them of a more or less usual type to attract the public.
A censorship, of course, will be needed.
Counter-revolutionary and immoral films should be barred.
” To this Lenin added: “As you find your feet, what with proper handling of the business, and receive certain loans to carry on, depending on the general improvement in the country’s position, you will have to expand production, and particularly make headway with useful films among the masses in the cities, and still more in the countryside.

389 447Lenin’s proposal on Kalinin’s trip to the Ukraine was adopted by the Politbureau on January 28.
Kalinin made the trip on February 7-18 and March 5-18, 1922, with the agittrain “October Revolution” along the route: Poltava—Mirgorod—Kiev—Belaya Tserkov—Kremenchug—Odessa—Zhmerinka—Kamenets Podolsk— Vinnitsa—Berdichev—Zhitomir.
p.
389 448This refers to an article entitled “The Ninth Congress of Soviets and the Peasantry” published in Pravda on January 27, 1922, over the signature Bespartiiny (Non-Party-Man).
The writer propounded a plan for popularising among the peasantry the decisions of the Ninth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on peasant questions.
Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on January 28, 1922.
p.
390 449The idea of an international conference to deal with all questions concerning the establishment of peace and economic co-operation in Europe, and also the question of Russian debts, was put forward by the Soviet Government, who addressed Notes to this effect to Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and the U.
S.
A.
(see Collected Works, Fifth Russian Edition, Vol.
44, pp.
185-88).
The decision to convene an international economic and financial conference was taken by the Supreme Allied Council at a conference in Cannes on January 6, 1922.
The Allies invited Soviet Russia to the conference in the hope of forcing from her a number of political and economic concessions while at the same time establishing economic relations with her.
The Soviet delegation to the Genoa Conference was elected at an emergency session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on January 27.
Lenin was appointed head of the delega-tion with Chicherin as his deputy “vested with all the rights as chairman in the event of circumstances preventing Comrade Lenin from attending the conference”.
Among the other members of the delegation were L.
B.
Krasin, M.
M.
Litvinov, N.
N.
Nari-manov, V.
V.
Vorovsky and Y.
E.
Rudzutak.
The question of Lenin going to Genoa was widely discussed by the people of the Soviet Republics.
Numerous letters were received expressingapprehension for his life and safety and declaring against his going to the conference.
The Central Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) passed a special decision on this question, under which Lenin resigned his commission to Chicherin as head of the delegation.
Lenin directed the work of the delegation, drew up the C.
C.
’s directives for it, and other important documents bearing on Soviet Russia’s participation in the Genoa Conference (see pp.
394-95, 396-98, 401-04, 410 of this volume, and volumes 44 and 45 of the Fifth Russian Edition).
The Genoa Conference sat from April 10 to May 19, 1922.
It was attended by representatives from 29 countries.
The declara-tion by the Soviet delegation, which was approved by Lenin and endorsed by the Council of People’s Commissars, stated: “While remaining true to the principles of communism, the Russian delegation recognises that in the present epoch, which makes the parallel existence of the old and the emergent new social system possible, economic co-operation between states repre-senting the two systems of property is imperatively necessary for universal economic reconstruction” (Materialy Genuezskoi konferentsii.
[Materials of the Genoa Conference.
] Verbatim Report.
Moscow, 1922, p.
78).
The Genoa Conference failed to settle the problems confront-ing it.
The Soviet delegation vigorously repelled the attempts of the imperialist powers to impose a colonial status upon Soviet Russia (the establishment of control over Soviet finances, etc.
).
By proposing talks on a general reduction of armaments and the banning of the most barbarous methods of warfare (poison gases, military aircraft), the Soviet delegation demonstrated to the world the peace-loving nature of Soviet Russia’s Leninist foreign policy.
p.
390 450Lenin here alludes to the policy of partial concessions which the British Government of Lloyd George carried out in the early twenties in order to suppress the revolutionary movement for national liberation in Ireland and Egypt.
The Anglo-Irish Treaty was signed on December 6, 1920, following a long and hard struggle for national independence by the Irish people.
The Treaty provided for the establishment of a dominion “Irish Free State” within the British Empire.
Six north-eastern counties (Ulster), the most industrially developed part of Ireland, were alienated to Great Britain.
After crushing the rebellion of the Egyptian people against British rule in December 1921, the British Government was compelled in February 1922 to terminate its protectorate and proclaim Egypt an “independent kingdom”.
Egypt, however, became only nominally “independent”, since all her territory remained occupied by Britain, who controlled the Suez Canal p.
393 zone, ruled Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, etc.
451The reference is to the forthcoming conference of the three Inter-nationals (the II, II 2 and III Communist International).
TheCommunist International’s active fight for the creation of a united workers’ front against the onset of the bourgeoisie and the leaning towards unity of action on the part of the working masses com-pelled the leadership of the II 2 International on January 19, 1922, to send a proposal to the Comintern Executive for conven-ing an international conference in the spring of 1922 to consider the problems of Europe’s economic position and action by the working class against the onset of reaction.
p.
393 452Smena Vekh (Change of Landmarks) a weekly journal published in Paris from October 1921 to March 1922 by a group of White émigré intellectuals.
The same group published a collection of articles under this title in Prague in July 1921.
A socio-political trend formed around this journal and the collection, which became known as Smenovekhism (its ideologists were N.
V.
Ustryalov, Y.
V.
Klyuchnikov, S.
S.
Lukyanov, A.
V.
Bobrishchev-Pushkin, S.
S.
Chakhotin, Y.
N.
Potekhin and others).
A slight revival of capitalist elements in Soviet Russia follow-ing the introduction of the New Economic Policy served as the social foundation for this trend.
The Smena Vekhists regarded the N.
E.
P.
as an evolution of Soviet rule towards the restoration of capitalism.
They stood for co-operation with the Soviet govern-ment in the hope of the Soviet state evolving back into a bourgeois state.
Some of them were prepared loyally to co-operate with the Soviet government and contribute to the country’s econom-ic revival.
The Twelfth All-Russia Conference of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) (August 4-7, 1922), in its Resolution on Anti-Soviet Parties and Trends, pointed out: “The so-called Smena Vekh trend has so far played and may still play an objectively progressive role.
It is rallying those groups of émigrés and Russian intellectuals who have “reconciled” themselves to the Soviet government and are prepared to work with it for reviving the country.
To this extent the Smena Vekh trend merits a favourable attitude towards it.
At the same time it should never for a moment be forgotten that there are strong tendencies towards bourgeois restoration among its adher-ents, who share with the Mensheviks and the Socialist-Revolu-tionaries the hope that economic concessions will be followed by political concessions towards a bourgeois democracy, etc.
” (The C.
P.
S.
U.
in the Resolutions and Decisions of Its Congresses, Conferences and Plenary Meetings of the Central Committee, Part I, 1954, p.
671).
Eventually, most of the Smena Vekh people sided openly with the counter-revolution.
A comment on this trend is given by Lenin in his report to the Eleventh Congress of the R.
C.
P.
(see present edition, Vol.
33, p.
285-86).

394 453Lenin’s note to the Politbureau followed the publication on February 2, 1922, in Izvestia of a telegram from Warsaw reporting the gist of Parvus’s pamphlet Der wirtschaftliche Rettungsweg in which its author justified the annexationist plans of German imperialism in the East, plans for colonial enslavement of thepeoples of Soviet Russia.
There, in Eastern Europe, Parvus wrote, “the way is open for German expansion, for German might, for German thrift ” .
Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on February 8.
After investigations into this matter the Politbureau passed a decision on March 11, 1922 (see the next document).

Lenin’s motion (see the next document) was put before the Politbureau at its meeting on February 15, 1922.
A decision was passed “To require the editorial board of Kooperativnoye Dyelo to submit to the Politbureau within three days an explana-tion in writing concerning the newspaper’s publication, its character, the composition of its editorial board, staff and con-tributors” (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism-Lenin-ism of the C.

398 456The first extended plenary meeting of the Comintern Executive was held in Moscow from February 21 to March 4, 1922.
It was attended by 105 delegates from 36 countries.
The highlight of the meeting was the question of the tactics of the united front.
In addition, the meeting heard a report on the situation within the various sections of the Comintern, and other questions.
The meeting adopted the theses on the struggle against war and the war menace, the theses on the New Economic Policy, a decision on the tactics of the united front, a resolution on the participation of the Comintern in the proposed conference of the three Inter-nationals, and a number of other documents.
Lenin did not sit in at the meeting owing to ill-health, but he took an active part in preparing the meeting and elaborated the tactics for the Comintern delegation to the conference of the three Internationals (see pp.
393-94, 406, etc.
of this volume).
Lenin’s proposed amendments to the draft resolution on parti-cipation in the conference of the three Internationals were adopted by the Politbureau of the C.
C.
on February 23, 1922.
A resolution on this point was adopted by the first plenary meeting of the Comintern Executive on March 4, 1922.
p.
400 457Lenin’s motion was adopted by the Politbureau on February 28, 1922, with the following amendments moved by Stalin: “1.
The question regarding recognition of the Soviet government shouldbe raised not at the beginning but at the close of the conference (after attempts had been made to reach an economic agreement), and no ultimatum should be made of it; 2.
Centrosoyuz, the agri-cultural co-operative, etc.
, should not be put forward at the con-ference in the capacity of subjects (contracting parties) (as Krasin suggests), and only a single subject—the Russian state should be taken into consideration” (Central Party Archives, Institute p.
404 of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

).
458The same day the Politbureau adopted Lenin’s proposal, and Chicherin sent a radio-telegram to the Italian Foreign Minister on the question of the date for convening the Genoa Conference (see Izvestia No.

It is a comment on the directives which G.
Y.
Zinoviev drafted and sent to Lenin on March 14, 1922, with a request to express his opinion on them before the draft was submitted to the Comintern Executive.
These directives, amended in accordance with Lenin’s remarks and proposals, were approved by the Politbureau, and unani-mously endorsed by the Comintern Executive on March 17.
p.
406 462The Politbureau adopted Lenin’s proposal on March 18, 1922.
p.
408 463Lenin’s letter was written in connection with the following incident.
Following numerous complaints of abuses practised in the Central Housing Department of the Moscow Soviet, an inspec-tion of this department was undertaken.
Similar complaints having been received addressed to Lenin, the inspection was carried out with the close co-operation of the C.
P.
C.
’s Business Manager (A.
A.
Divilkovsky).
The inspection revealed abuses practised by a number of top members of the staff of the Central Housing Department with the connivance of the Department Chief of the Moscow Communal Services Sovetnikov, a member of the Party.
The Bureau of the Moscow Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
), at a joint meeting with the Presidium of the Moscow Soviet on March 14, declared the findings of the inspection com-mission to be unfounded and decided to refer the matter to a new,Party commission for revision.
In his letter to N.
P.
Gorbunov dated March 15, copies of which were forwarded to all members of the Politbureau for their information, Divilkovsky stressed that this decision ran counter to Lenin’s instructions that “bureau-cratic banditism, especially when practised by suspicious ele-ments who have wormed their way into the Party” should be relentlessly prosecuted, and he asked that this decision be reversed and the guilty parties put on trial (Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

When sending his letter to Molotov for members of the Polit-bureau, Lenin wrote on it: “Gorbunov, forward immediately , show to Tsyurupa and Rykov.
” p.
408 464This document was written in connection with L.
M.
Khinchuk’s letter dated March 17, 1922, asking Lenin for instructions whether or not the question of voluntary principle of membership of the co-operatives should be raised at the forthcoming Fifth Session of the Delegates’ Council of Centrosoyuz.
Lenin’s proposals were incorporated in the decision of the Politbureau of May 12, 1922, “On Compulsory Membership, Voluntary Contributions and p.
409 Unity of Consumers’ Co-operatives”.
465All Lenin’s amendments and remarks to the draft declaration for the Soviet delegation to the Genoa Conference submitted by Chicherin were taken into consideration.
This declaration was read out by Chicherin at the first plenary session of the Genoa Conference on April 10, 1922.
p.
410 466Lenin is referring to the following draft speech submitted by Chicherin: “We attach the greatest importance to Point One of the Cannes resolution concerning mutual recognition of the political and economic systems in both camps of the present -day world” (Central Party Archives of the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

In addition, the congress set up a commission to prepare thequestion of Party work in the countryside for discussion in the Agrarian Section of the Party Congress and for drafting a reso-lution.
Considerable preparatory work for the congress was carried out by the C.
C.
under Lenin’s direction.
The most important docu-ments of the congress were drafted by Lenin or with Lenin’s help.
Lenin opened the congress, delivered the political report of the C.
C.
, wound up the debate on the report, spoke about the printing of advertisement in Pravda, and made the closing speech at the congress.

C.
P.
(B.
), D.
B.
Rya-zanov moved an addendum, proposing that advertisements should not be printed in the Party press.
The congress adopted the motion with the amendment that advertisements were to be forbidden not in the Party press as a whole, but only in Pravda.
Lenin was not in attendance at the moment.
Upon hearing of the congress decision he wrote the following note to L.
B.
Kamenev who had chaired that session: “Comrade Kamenev, I hear that the congress has placed a ban on advertisements in Pravda? Cannot this be mended, it’s an obvious mistake?” (Lenin Miscel-lany XIII, 1930, p.
29).
Kamenev did not think the decision could be altered, and suggested that other ways be found for supporting Pravda.
However, after the list of members of the C.
C.
and the Central Control Commission elected by the congress had been announced, Lenin took the floor and proposed that this decision be reversed on the grounds that under the New Economic Policy it would be incorrect to depend upon appropriations for the press being made from the gold fund or revenue receipts.
His motion was adopted.
Since Lenin’s speech was taken down in shorthand only partially and inadequately at that, the version printed in this volume is incomplete.

414 472The Conference of the Three Internationals was held in Berlin from April 2 to 5, 1922.
A sharp struggle developed at the conference between the representatives of the II and II 2 Internationals on the one hand, and the Communist International on the other.
The Comin-tern delegation put forward a proposal that a world congress should be convened, in which the trade unions and other organi-sations of the workers would participate, to discuss questions concerning the fight against the onset of capital, against reaction, and against preparations for new imperialist wars, concerning aid for the rehabilitation of Soviet Russia, the Treaty of Ver-sailles, and the rehabilitation of the devastated areas.
The repre-sentatives of the II International, supported by the delegation of the II 2 International, tried to impose unacceptable terms on the Comintern delegation, namely: the separation of Georgia from the Soviet state, renunciation of communist cells in the mass workers’ organisations and the release of political criminals.
The Comintern delegation (Bukharin, Radek, and C.
Zetkin), while rejecting these terms, nevertheless agreed to the condition that the Soviet authorities would not apply the death penalty in the case of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and would allow representatives of the II and II 2 Internationals to attend the trial.
In his article “We Have Paid Too Much”, Lenin severely criticised these concessions on the part of the Comintern delega-tion at the Berlin Conference, which he considered erroneous (see present edition, Vol.
33, pp.
330-34).
A general declaration was adopted at the conference recognising the possibility of holding joint meetings and issuing joint state-ments on concrete issues.
The declaration called upon all the working people to hold mass demonstrations during the Genoa Conference with slogans to fight for an eight-hour day, against unemployment, against the onset of capital upon the working class, in defence of the Russian revolution, in aid of Russia’s famine-stricken areas, for the resumption by all states of polit-ical and economic relations with Soviet Russia, for the establish-ment of a united proletarian front in all countries on a national and international scale.
The conference went on record for the speedy convocation of a world congress and set up a steering committee of nine members (three from each International) to prepare further conferences and a congress.
However, the reformist leadership of the II and II 2 Interna-tionals who accepted this agreement under pressure from the broad masses of the working people, torpedoed and sabotaged the united struggle of the working class.
On May 21, 1922, a num-ber of parties of the II and II 2 Internationals passed a decision to call a world congress at the Hague without the Communists.
By this means the reformist leaders blocked the effort to create a united front of the workers.
In view of this the Comintern delegation at the meeting of the steering committee on May 23,1922, in Berlin, announced its withdrawal from the Committee of Nine.
Lenin’s remarks and proposals were made to the following draft decision for the Presidium of the Comintern Executive in connection with the Berlin Conference of the Three Interna-tionals: “1) To step up the campaign against the Mensheviks and Socialist -Revolutionaries throughout the international com-munist press.
2) To start making systematic use of the material of the Berlin Conference for attacking every weak spot of the opponent.
3) The general appeals of the Nine not to be issued for the time being.
4) In agitation during the demonstration on April 20, to be free-spoken in criticising our opponents.
5) The various sections act according to the concrete conditions.
6) Any new steps by the delegation to be postponed until the question of ratifying the Berlin results is dealt with” (Central Party Archives, Insti-tute of Marxism-Leninism of the C.

476This document was written in connection with the discussion of the question of the foreign trade monopoly which was taking place in leading Party circles at the end of 1921 and during 1922.
The monopoly of foreign trade, established by Decree of the Council of People’s Commissars of April 22, 1918, was repeatedly reconfirmed in decisions of the Soviet Government.
The adoption of the New Economic Policy and expansion of trade relations with foreign countries necessitated legislative amendments in the sphere of foreign trade.
The Theses on Foreign Trade, which A.
M.
Lezhava, Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, drafted at Lenin’s request, stressed the need for strengtheningthe monopoly of foreign trade and determined the conditions for the export and import of goods under the new conditions.
Lenin approved the Theses, which were accepted on January 4, 1922, by the Supreme Economic Commission of the C.
P.

Sokolnikov, N.

Stalin, G.

The Politbureau of the C.
C.
, R.

approved the Theses on March 4, 1922, with cer-tain amendments.
The final version of the Theses was endorsed on March 10.
On the basis of these Theses the Presidium of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on March 13, 1922, passed its decision “On Foreign Trade” (published in Izvestia.
No.
60, March 15, 1922).
Despite the decision of the Politbureau, Sokolnikov continued to press his point of view and proposed a plan under which the state corporations, co-operatives, etc.
were to be allowed to buy food abroad; M.
I.
Frumkin, Deputy People’s Commissar for Foreign Trade, also stood for a relaxation of the foreign trade monopoly and proposed leaving only 4 or 5 items of wholesale trade in the hands of the state on the basis of a firm monopoly.

Ambassador in Germany, testifying to the adverse influence which the Party controversy on the foreign trade monop-oly was having on the business negotiations with foreign capital-ists, Lenin on May 15 wrote the draft decision printed here, together with a letter to Stalin and Frumkin in which he pointed out that “a formal ban should be put on all talk and nego-tiations and commissions, etc.
concerning the relaxation of the foreign trade monopoly” (Collected Works, Vol.
54, Fifth Russian Edition, p.
260).
Stalin wrote on Lenin’s letter: “I have no objections to a ‘formal ban’ on measures to mitigate the foreign trade monopoly at the present stage.
All the same, I think that mitigation is becoming indispensable” (Lenin.
A Biography, Moscow, 1966, p.

After a talk with Kursky on this question, Lenin wrote his second letter with the rough draft of an additional Article to the Criminal Code.

P.
, asking whether or not the question of re-ducing the size of the Red Army should be raised at the Third Session of the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
of the Ninth Convocation.
A plan for reducing the size of the Red Army was being drafted by the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic in con-nection with the question of a possible general reduction in arma-ments which had been raised by the Soviet delegation at the Genoa Conference.
This question was included in the agenda of the Third Session in a tentative form, depending on the results of the Genoa Conference.
On May 24, 1822, the All-Russia C.
E.
C.
passed a resolution which stated: “Thanks to the line pur-sued by our delegation, the Genoa Conference gives ground for hoping that a serious reduction of the army is possible.
” The resolution went on to say: “The Genoa Conference, however, has provided no solution to the most pressing problems concerning the relations between the Soviet Republic and the bourgeois states, leaving fundamental issues to be dealt with at the Hague.
.
.
.
” In view of this the question of reducing the army was removed from the agenda of the Third Session.
The session asked the Government and the People’s Commissariat for Military Affairs to table a pertinent motion when the results of the Hague Confer-ence had been ascertained (see Third Session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of the Ninth Convocation.

and the independent national Soviet Republics in preparation for the next plenary meeting of the Party’s Central Committee.
This commission, set up on August 11, consisted of J.

Orjonikidze, K.
G.
Ra-kovsky, G.

F.
Myasnikov (Armenia), P.

Stalin drafted the commission’s resolution “On the Relations Between the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
and the Independent Republics”, which provided for the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia entering the Russian Federation as autonomous repub-lics.
Stalin’s draft was forwarded for discussion to the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Soviet national republics.
It was supported by the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Azerbaijan and Armenia.
The C.
C.
of the Georgian Communist Party was against the draft resolution.
At its meeting on September 15, 1922, it passed the following decision by a majority vote: “The union in the form of autono-misation of the independent republics proposed on the basis of Stalin’s theses is premature.
A union of economic efforts and a common policy are necessary, but all attributes of independence should be preserved.
” The C.
C.
of the Byelorussian Communist Party went on record for the preservation of treaty relations between the independent republics.
The C.
C.
of the Ukrainian C.
P.
did not discuss the draft.
The commission met on September 23 and 24, 1922, with V.
M.
Molotov in the chair.
It approved Stalin’s draft (with one abstention—the representative from Georgia).
In a special point the commission rejected the resolution of the C.
C.
of the Georgian Communist Party.
Stalin’s draft was gone over point by point and approved by a majority with certain minor amend-ments and addenda.
Point 2 stating that the decisions of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labour and Defence of the R.
S.

S.
R.
were binding upon the corresponding bodies of the national republics was carried by an 8 to 1 majority (Mdivani voting against and Petrovsky abstaining).
The final wording of the commission’s resolution, which Lenin deals with in his letter to the members of the Politbureau, was as follows: “1.
It is considered advisable that treaties be concluded between the Soviet Republics of the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia and the R.

On September 25 the commission’s materials (Stalin’s draft, the resolution and minutes of the commission’s meetings, and the resolutions of the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia) were sent to Lenin at Gorki.
Simultaneously, without waiting for Lenin s instructions and without the question being considered in the Politbureau, the Secretariat of the C.
C.
sent the commission’s resolution to all the members and alternate members of the C.
C.
in preparation for the latter’s plenary meeting fixed for October 5.
After studying the Commission’s material Lenin wrote his letter to the members of the Politbureau which is published in this volume.
The letter is dated September 27, apparently this is a slip of the pen, since the Registration Book of Lenin’s Letters, Notes and Instructions bears an entry stating that this letter was forwarded to the members of the Politbureau on September 26; moreover, Lenin’s conversation with Stalin, to which reference is made in the letter, took place on September 26; it can be inferred from this that Lenin’s letter was written on September 26.
In his letter to the members of the Politbureau Lenin came out against Stalin’s idea of “autonomisation” of the independent national Soviet Republics and suggested a fundamentally differ-ent way of uniting them by creating a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (see also Lenin’s letter “The Question of Nationalities or ‘Autonomisation’”, present edition, Vol.
36, pp.
605-11).
In accordance with Lenin’s proposals the resolution drafted by the C.
C.
’s Commission was revised.
The new resolution was worded as follows: “ 1 .
It is considered necessary that a treaty be concluded between the Ukraine, Byelorussia, the Federation of Transcaucasian Republics and the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
for their amalgamation in a Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, each reserving the right to freely secede from membership of the Union.

The People’s Commissariats for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, Military Affairs, Railways and Post and Telegraph of the republics and federations comprising the Union shall be merged with those of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the cor-responding commissariats of the Union of Republics having in the republics and federations their agents and a small staff appoint-ed by the People’s Commissars of the Union by arrangement with the Central Executive Committees of the federations and republics.
“Note: It is considered necessary for the republics concerned to be represented on the corresponding foreign agencies of thePeople’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs and the People’s Com-missariat for Foreign Trade.
“5.
The People’s Commissariats for Finance, Food, National Economy, Labour and Inspection of the republics and federations comprising the Union of Republics, also the central agencies for fighting counter-revolution shall be subject to the directives of the corresponding People’s Commissariats and to the decisions of the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Labour and Defence of the Union of Republics.
“6.

On October 6, 1922, the day on which the question of the relations between the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
and the independent republics was discussed at the plenary meeting of the C.
C.
, Lenin, who was unable to attend the meeting, wrote a note to Kamenev urging the need for combating dominant-nation chauvinism and pro-posing an addendum to the resolution saying that representatives of all the uniting republics should take their turn in presiding at the Union Central Executive Committee (see Collected Works, Fifth [Russian] Edition, Vol.
45, p.
214).
The C.
C.
plenum fully supported Lenin, adopted a resolution in the form of C.
C.
directives based on his proposals, and instruct -ed a new commission to draft a bill on the formation of the U.
S.
S.
R.
for submission to the Congress of Soviets.
The members of the C.
C.
in their speeches strongly denounced all manifesta-tions of dominant-nation chauvinism.
At the same time the plenum rebuffed Mdivani, who at first objected to the formation of the U.
S.
S.
R.
and then insisted on Georgia joining the U.
S.
S.

directly, and not through the Transcaucasian Federation.
Guided by Lenin’s instructions, the Central Committee of the Party directed all the subsequent work of uniting the republics.
On December 30, 1922, the First All-Union Congress of Soviets met to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

421 482 The Fifth All-Russia Congress of the Textile Workers Trade Union was held in Moscow from October 6 to 11, 1922.
It was attended by 350 voting delegates and 117 delegates with voice but no vote.
The congress discussed the report of the Trade Unions Central Committee, and reports on the state of the textile industry, on the All-Russia Congress of Trade Unions, on the organisational question, on the conditions of labour, on cultural work and the international labour movement among the textile workers.
At the opening meeting the delegates elected Lenin honorary chairman of the congress and sent him greetings.
On October 9, 1922, they invited Lenin to the congress, and he accepted the invitation.
He was unable to attend it, however, as his health had taken a turn for the worse.
Lenin’s message of greeting was read out at the morning session on October 10.
The platform committee, on behalf of the delegates, sent him a letter in reply to his greetings.

“On the occasion of its anniversary the Petrograd Textile Trust sends you its ardent greetings and begs you to accept a woollen blanket made at one of its mills.
“We, Petrograd textile workers, should like the warmth of our modest present to bring you the warmth of our hearts and also to show you that in spite of the extremely worn-out condition of our equipment, in spite of the devastation, the shortages and crises, we are working no worse than before the war, which proves that we can achieve whatever we set out to do.
“We wish you, dear Comrade Lenin, good health.
” p.
425 486 On November 16, 1922, the Politbureau passed a decision to reduce the army in the course of January 1923 from 800,000 to 600,000 men.
The plenum of the C.
C.

C.
P.
(B.

P.
C.
was instructed to find means of quickly normalising the work of the munition factories.
The plenum recommended that an appeal be issued in the name of the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets to all nations, emphasising once more the striving of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
towards general disarmament and calling upon the peoples to overcome the resistance which this proposal of the Soviet Republic was meeting on the part of other states.
The Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, on behalf of the millions of the working people, once more solemnly confirmed their desire for peace and peaceful labour.
“Working people of the world!” ran the appeal of the congress.
“All who desire peaceful labour, join your efforts to the effortsof Soviet Russia in order to secure peace, and safeguard mankind from monstrous and destructive wars!.
.
.
“The Tenth Congress of Soviets solemnly confirms its line of peaceful policy and calls upon everyone to support this line.
Let all the peoples demand peace of their governments.
The cause of peace is in the hands of the peoples themselves.
To avert the danger of future wars the working people of all the world must unite their efforts.
Worn-out, suffering, ruined and starv-ing mankind must have peace secured to them at all cost.

was estimated at about three million people in the twenties, most of whom were immigrants who had left Russia before the revolution for political, economic or religious motives.
The members of the bourgeoisie, nobility and intelligentsia, who had escaped from Russia after the October Socialist Revolution, were an insignificant minority.
The different social and economic status of these groups and their different attitudes towards Soviet Russia led to the division of the Russian colony into two hostile camps.
One camp was made up of the Society of Friends of Soviet Russia (Russian section), the Society for Technical Aid for Soviet Russia, the Russian sections of the U.
S.
trade unions, the joint conference of various Russian mutual benefit societies and other progressive workers’ organisations, around which were united the majority of colonists.
The other camp was an alliance of various Russian petty-bourgeois and monarchist organisations united around the anti-Soviet news-paper Novoye Russkoye Slovo (The New Russian Word).
Lenin’s letter was addressed to that part of the Russian colony in the U.
S.
A.
which was grouped around the organisations that stood for friendly relations with Soviet Russia.
p.
425 488The agenda of the Fourth Congress of the Communist Interna-tional, which was held from November 5 to December 5, 1922, contained the question of the programme of the Communist International.
The Congress had before it the programme drafted by Bukharin and tabled in his own name, and also the draft pro-grammes of the Communist Parties of Bulgaria and Germany and the “Programme of Action of the Italian Communist Party”.
On November 13, in his report “Five Years of the Russian Revo-lution and the Prospects of the World Revolution” Lenin suggested holding simply a general discussion on all the programmes, “to make the first reading, so to speak” and to get them printed in order to study and prepare the programme more profoundly and thoroughly (see present edition, Vol.
33, pp.
418-32).
During the discussion of these drafts, lively debates revolved around the question of transition and limited demands, as a means of pre-paring the masses for the socialist revolution, for the struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat.
Bukharin was opposed to the more general transition and limited demands being theoret-ically substantiated in the programme of the Comintern, andeven accused of opportunism those who urged the inclusion of these propositions.
Bukharin’s point of view was criticised by the congress delegates.
The delegation of the R.
C.
P.
asked the platform committee of the congress to be allowed to discuss the question of the programme within the delegation before the congress passed any decision on it; this request was granted by the congress (see Bulletin of the Fourth Congress of the Commu-nist International No.
14-15, p.
31).
A meeting of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) delegation Bureau was held on November 20, 1922, at which the proposals printed in this book were drawn up as a draft resolution for the congress.
According to available information, the very important points 4 and 5 were dictated by Lenin almost word for word.
p.
427 489The Bureau of the R.
C.
P.
delegation, at its meeting on Novem-ber 20, 1922, also drew up the following “Statement of the Russian Delegation”: “In view of the fact that the dispute on how the transition demands should be worded and in what part of the programme they should be treated created the wrong impression that the divergence of opinion was on a matter of principle, the Russian delegation lays down unanimously that the inclusion of the transition demands into the programmes of the national sections, their general wording and theoretical substantiation in the general part of the programme cannot be considered as opportunism.
” This statement was read at the congress meeting on November 21, after which the presiding committee of the congress submitted to the delegates for consideration the proposals drafted by the Bureau of the R.
C.
P.
delegation, to which slight editorial changes had been made.
The congress adopted the proposals as a resolution of the congress (see Bulletin of the Fourth Congress of p.
428 the Communist International No.
18, pp.
7-8).

p.
429 492On the morning of December 13 Lenin had two attacks of illness.
The doctors ordered him a complete rest.
“The doctors,” his sister Maria (M.
I.
Ulyanova) wrote later, “had great difficulty in persuading Vladimir Ilyich to drop work altogether and go out into the country.
Meanwhile he was to lie down for as long aspossible and not go for walks.
In the end Vladimir Ilyich agreed to leave town and said “I’ll start winding up my affairs this very day’.
” From then on Lenin spent several days at home, dictating letters and giving various instructions, anxious to wind up his affairs, to which he attached great importance.

p.
439 496Here allowance should be made for the scale of prices that ex-isted in 1920.
Owing to the continuous growth of emission during the early years of Soviet government, paper money was rapidly depreciating.
According to the data of the Currency Board of the People’s Commissariat for Finance of the U.
S.
S.
R.
, the value of the gold ruble (taking as equivalent the gold coins of pre-revolution-ary times) averaged 1,633 paper rubles in the first half-year of 1920, rising to 4,083 rubles in the second half-year (see Nashe Denezhnoye Obrashcheniye.

497Lenin was elected to the Tenth Congress of the R.
C.
P.
as a voting delegate by the Fourteenth Petrograd Gubernia Party Confer-ence from the supporters of the “Platform of the Ten”.
The delegation was unable to attend the congress in its elected form owing to the critical situation in the city and the counter-revolu-tionary mutiny at Kronstadt which had just started.
Apparently it was in the absence of minutes recording the election of the Petrograd delegation that Lenin wrote in the questionnaire that he had a debating voice.
Nevertheless he took part in the voting of all the resolutions and figured in the list of delegates to the Tenth Party Congress as a voting delegate (see Tenth Congress of the R.

The copy to be sent to Pravda retyped fair with all his final corrections and changes was looked through by Lenin, after which it was passed on to Maria Ilyinichna.
The three copies that Nadezhda Konstantinovna had received were also corrected.
The rough copies were burnt by me.
He asked that the sealed envelopes in which the copies of the documents were kept should be marked to the effect that they could only be opened by V.
