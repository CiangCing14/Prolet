460-61PREFACE Volume 39 of the Collected Works contains Lenin’s Note-books on Imperialism, the materials he gathered for his classic Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, written in the first half of 1916.
In it, Lenin for the first time gives a profound and comprehensive analysis of the highest stage of capitalism, the inception of which dates to the turn of the century.
He shows that imperialism is a development and continuation of the chief characteristics of capitalism, that its economic basis, its very substance, is the dominance of monopoly, that imperialism is the last stage of capital-ism.
Lenin conclusively proved that, in contrast to the pre-monopoly stage, when capitalism was still on the ascent, monopoly capitalism is, parasitic, decaying and moribund capitalism, with all the contradictions of capitalism car-ried to extreme limits, beyond which begins the socialist revolution.
The historic significance of Lenin’s book lies in its eco-nomic substantiation of the new theory of socialist revolu-tion.
Proceeding from a Marxist analysis of imperialism and the law discovered by him of the uneven economic and political development of capitalist countries, Lenin scientifically proved that in the era of monopoly capital-ism the simultaneous victory of the socialist revolution in all or in most civilised countries was impossible, but that it was fully possible, and inevitable, first in several countries, or even in one country.
Lenin’s theory of the socialist revolution is an immense contribution to Marx-ism; it equips the working class of all countries with a clear and precise programme of struggle for liberation from impe-rialism, for the victory of socialism.
The great power and vitality of Lenin’s theory of the socialist revolution has been confirmed in practice by the experience of the prole-tarian revolutions in Russia, China and other countriesof Europe and Asia, which now form the world socialist system.
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism was the fruit of tremendous and intense labour.
Striking evidence of this is the Notebooks on Imperialism, the mass of varied preparatory material that went into the writing of the book.
Marx, it will be recalled, used a vast amount of fac-tual material in working on Capital.
Studying capitalism in the new era of history, Lenin also analysed and general-ised a vast amount of data on the most diverse problems.
He drew his data from hundreds of books, theses, pamphlets, magazine and newspaper articles, and statistical reports.
The Notebooks contain extracts from 148 books (106 in German, 23 in French, 17 in English and two translations into Russian), and 232 articles (of which 206 in German, 13 in French and 13 in English) from 49 periodicals (34 German, 7 French and 8 English).
Although the Notebooks are not a work in its final form, they are of immense scientific value and represent an impor-tant contribution to Marxist political economy.
The wealth of material brought together in the Notebooks provides a closer picture of monopoly capitalism, and supplements and elucidates the principal theses of Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism.
The great scientific and cognitive value of the Notebooks is that they reveal Lenin’s method of scientific work, his approach to the material under investigation—economic and historical facts, and statistical data.
The Notebooks show us the methodology of Lenin’s analysis, his research technique.
The preliminary materials showing how Lenin drew up the plan for his Imperialism will be read with great interest.
They trace the full process, from the first rough draft (or subject-outline), with an approximate enumeration of the problems, to the final research plan, with its detailed structure of the book and summarised contents of each chapter (see this volume, pp.
116-17, 196, 201-02, 230-43).
In the Notebooks Lenin meticulously traces the emergence and development of the principal features of monopoly capitalism: concentration of production and capital, which has reached such a high leyel as to create monopolies that play a decisive role in economic life; the merging of bankcapital with industrial capital and the rise of a financial oligarchy; the export of capital, which, as distinct from the export of commodities, has acquired exceptional impor-tance; the formation of international monopolist associations of capitalists; the completion of the territorial division of the world by the biggest capitalist powers and their struggle for its redivision; the progressive parasitism and decay of capitalism.
Lenin shows that the omnipotence and domi-nation of finance capital and the monopolies is character-istic of imperialism.
Reaction in every sphere is its polit-ical feature.
Lenin reveals, against a massive background of factual material, the profound contradictions of impe-rialism.
To do this, Lenin draws on all available international literature on economics and technology, modern history, geography, politics, diplomacy, the labour and national liberation movements in the era of monopoly capitalism.
No country, no branch of the economy, or of social policy and politics, remain outside his field of vision.
He made a close study both of economic and historical monographs on the main development trends in the capitalist coun-tries, and of small magazine and newspaper articles on par-ticular problems.
All these numerous and diverse sources are critically assessed and analysed to produce a firm and reliable foundation of facts and figures for a comprehensive substantiation of his theoretical propositions and conclu-sions about imperialism.
In his study of the monopoly stage of capitalism Lenin used sources reflecting diverse trends in economic science— books by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois economists and statisticians, historians and diplomats, financial experts and parliamentary leaders, reformists and revisionists.
But in using these sources, and selectively drawing on their rich factual data, Lenin exposes the bourgeois ideol-ogists and reformist apologists of imperialism and their pseudo-scientific views.
After working through the “half-thousand pages” of Pro-fessor Robert Liefmann’s Holding and Financing Compa-nies, Lenin remarks: “The author is a double-dyed idiot, who makes a great fuss about definitions—very stupid ones—all revolving around the word ‘substitution’.
Hisfactual data, however, mostly quite raw, are valuable” (see p.
373 of this volume).
Lenin used Liefmann’s statistical data, checked against and supplemented from other sources, in his Imperialism to illustrate the growing concentra-tion of production and the growing incomes of the top monop-olies.
Of Schulze-Gaevernitz, the out-and-out apologist of German imperialism, the author of British Imperialism from which he made copious notes, Lenin wrote: “Scoun-drel of the first order and vulgar to boot, Kantian, pro-religion, chauvinist,—has collected some very interesting facts about British imperialism and has written a lively, readable book.
Travelled in Britain and collected a mass of material and observations.
You’ve done a lot of plun-dering, you British gentlemen; allow us, too, a bit of plun-dering—with Kant, God, patriotism, and science to ‘san-ctify’ it = such is the sum and substance of the position of this ‘savant’!! (Also a lot of needless verbiage)” (ibid.
, p.
446).
Lenin used the factual material in his Imperialism.
The Notebooks show how, from the welter of material in the numerous sources he used, Lenin selected trustworthy data on fundamental and typical phenomena of monopoly capitalism.
“.
.
.
a host of unnecessary and boring details; I omit them”—he writes about one book (p.
99).
About another he remarks that it contains “a most painstaking summary of very rich data ((a mass of basic figures)).
.
.
.
I select the most important” (p.
474).
In many cases Lenin compiles his own summaries and tables from scattered data.
When studying any book Lenin takes special note of the sources used in it and afterwards examines and checks them.
The Notebooks set out detailed factual and statistical data characterising the principal features of the monopoly stage of capitalism.
They contain revealing admissions by bourgeois experts of all countries concerning the new developments in the capitalist economy.
All these mate-rials, Lenin points out, are necessary “to enable the reader to obtain a more rounded-out idea of imperialism” (present edition, Vol.
22, p.
267).
The Notebooks contain important data on monopoly capi-talism in Russia.
Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capi-talism was intended for legal publication and Lenin therefore had to discuss Russian imperialism, and in particular thetsarist government’s predatory policy, “with extreme cau-tion, by hints, in an allegorical language—in that ac-cursed Aesopian language—to which tsarism compelled all revolutionaries to have recourse whenever they took up the pen to write a ‘legal’ work” (ibid.
, p.
187).
The Notebooks were not trammelled by censorship and in them Lenin cites, appraises and comments on numerous facts relating to various aspects of Russian imperialism.
This is a very valuable supplement to his remarks about Russia in Imperialism.
In analysing the highest stage of capitalism, both in the Notebooks and in Imperialism, Lenin uses mostly factual data and statistics of the period preceding the First World War: More recent and present-day data on the capitalist economy fully confirm Lenin’s analysis of imperialism, its principal features and development trends, and convincingly demonstrate the growth of monopoly dominance and oppres-sion, the progressing parasitism and decay of capitalism, the accentuation and deepening of its contradictions.
The Notebooks are a brilliant example of partisanship in science, a basic feature being their militant, attacking approach to bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologists, reform-ists and revisionists.
Lenin makes a point of exposing Kautskyism; he sharply criticises the lackeys of imperial-ism parading as Marxists.
The Kautskyites glossed over the contradictions of imperialism, sought to whitewash capitalism, and were “in favour of a cleanish, sleek, moder-ate and genteel capitalism” (see p.
116 of this volume).
Lenin shows that “finance capital does not abolish the lower (less developed, backward) forms of capitalism, but grows out of them, above them”, and that “finance capital (monopolies, banks, oligarchy, buying up, etc.
) is not an accidental excrescence on capitalism, but its ineradicable continuation and product” (p.
196).
Lenin’s scientific analysis of imperialism, confirmed by the reality of contemporary capitalism, fully exposed the fallacious and reactionary Kautskyite theory of ultra-impe-rialism.
The Notebooks show that the opportunists and revi-sionists, instead of fighting to overthrow imperialism, strive for reconciliation with capital; they distort the essen-tial character of imperialism as the highest and last stage of capitalist development, as the period of the decline ofworld capitalism.
“The struggle against imperialism without breaking with and combating opportunism is deception,” Lenin wrote in an outline plan for his Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (p.
241).
In our day, too, the Notebooks are a potent weapon of revolutionary Marxism.
They help the Communist and Workers’ Parties combat the ideology of imperialist reac-tion and all manifestations of modern reformism and revi-sionism.
In this era of transition from capitalism to social-ism, when the socialist system is successfully competing with the obsolescent capitalist system, the defenders of the old order exert every effort to embellish capitalism, divert the masses from active struggle for socialism, and infect them with reformist ideas of collaboration with capital.
The imperialists encourage every manner of theory and plan for “reconstructing” and reforming capitalist socie-ty.
Their aim is to perpetuate it under the guise of “people’s capitalism” or “democratic socialism”.
And in this they are aided by the modern revisionists, who repeat the bankrupt ideas of Kautskyism and try to excise the revolutionary soul of Marxism.
Declaring that Marxism-Leninism is “obso-lete”, they oppose the socialist revolution and the dictator-ship of the proletariat.
Distorting reality, they maintain that modern capitalism has undergone a radical change—the proletariat, they allege, is no longer an oppressed and ex-ploited class, and the capitalists have become working people.
The antagonism between labour and capital, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, we are told, have been replaced by peace and co-operation, and capital-ist society is on the way to prosperity and “universal well-being”.
For revolutionary Marxists the Notebooks are a guide and model of scientific criticism and exposure of these latter-day theories about the conversion of imperialism into “peo-ple’s capitalism” and its peaceful evolution into socialism.
The plans and outlines of some of Lenin’s articles and lectures during the First World War, included in this vol-ume, complement the material of the Notebooks and are of especial value for an understanding of Lenin’s theory of imperialism and socialist revolution.
In the Preface to the first edition of his Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (dated April 26, 1917), Lenin refers the readerto his articles of 1914-17, published outside Russia.
Appear-ing in the uncensored Party press, they substantiate and develop the propositions that imperialism is the eve of the socialist revolution, that social-chauvinism (socialism in words, chauvinism in deeds) is a complete betrayal of socialism and defection to the bourgeoisie, that the split in the labour movement is inseparably connected with the objective conditions created by imperialism, etc.
The present volume includes Lenin’s twenty notebooks on imperialism together with miscellaneous notes written between 1912 and 1916.
They were first published in 1933-38 in Lenin Miscellanies XXII, XXVII, XXVIII, XXIX, XXX, XXXI.
Notebook “δ ” (“Delta”), which was discov-ered later, was first published in 1938 in the magazine Proletarskaya Revolutsia No.
9, pp.
171-84.
All the Note-books were put out in a separate volume in 1939.
The first fifteen notebooks, numbered by the letters of the Greek alphabet, are here given in the order followed by Lenin.
He used them in the plan for his book on imperialism, as indicated in Notebook “γ ” (“Gamma”) (pp.
230-43 of this volume.
Lenin’s references to the pages of the Notebooks are followed by the corresponding pages of this volume, given in square brackets).
The material of these fifteen notebooks was extensively used in the writing of Impe-rialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism.
The other five notebooks were not numbered by Lenin and are here pub-lished after the numbered ones in chronological order.
In addition to the notebooks, the present volume contains miscellaneous notes made by Lenin in 1912-16.
Directly connected with the Notebooks, they continue Lenin’s elabo-ration of the theory of imperialism.
They were published in Lenin Miscellany XXIX and, partly, XXX.
Compared with the preceding 1939 edition of the Note-books, the section “Miscellaneous Notes, 1912-16” has in this volume been supplemented by the following items: 1) E.
Corradini, Italian Nationalism; 2) Nitti, Foreign Capital in Italy; 3) R.
Liefmann, “Does the War Bring Socialism Nearer?”; 4) Conrad’s Jahrbücher, 1915, No.
2, August; 5) Papers of the Society for Social Policy; 6) “Social-Imperialism and Left Radicalism”; 7) E.
Rappard, Towards National Agreement; 8) A Good Summary of ComparativeFigures; 9) A.
B.
Hart, The Monroe Doctrine; 10) Eug.
Philippovich, Monopolies.
Several items have not been included in this edition as having no direct relation to the subject.
Lenin made all extracts in the language of the original.
With the exception of the notebooks “κ” (“Kappa”), “Brails-ford”, “On Marxism and Imperialism”, “Imperialism”, and also, in part, the notebooks “ ζ” (“Zeta”) and “ λ” (“Lambda”), which were made by N.
K.
Krupskaya on his instructions, all excerpts were made by Lenin personally.
All the headings in the Notebooks were given by Lenin.
Ex-cerpts from books, articles, outlines and source references are given separate headings taken from Lenin’s contents table to each notebook, or from the text of the excerpts.
Lenin’s arrangement of the material, his marginal notes, underlinings, etc.
, are fully reproduced in this volume by type variations: a single underlining by italics, a double underlining by s p a c e d i t a l i c s, three lines by heavy Roman type, and four lines by s p a c e d h e a v y R o-m a n t y p e.
A wavy underlining is indicated by h e a v y italics, if double—by s p a c e d h e a v y i t a l i c s.
The entire text has been rechecked with Lenin’s manu-scripts and the original sources.
Any inaccuracies discov-ered in the deciphering of the manuscripts, or in checking with the original sources, have been corrected.
All the statistical data have been rechecked and are here given in full accordance with the manuscripts.
Appar-ent inexact figures of totals, differences and percentages, which occur in some cases, have been left unchanged, since they are due to the figures being rounded off by Lenin.
Numerous references to Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism and to other Lenin’s works are given in footnotes.
This helps to bring out the close connection between the Notebooks and Imperialism and clearly shows how Lenin used his vast fund of preparatory material in his scientific study of imperialism.

“Such a federation” (of Balkan countries, including Turkey) “would be able to satisfy the cultural needs of this geographically integral area and to erect an in-surmountable barrier to the advance of European N.

imperialism, and also of Russian world power.
All other solutions of the Balkan problem can be only of a temporary nature and cannot for long satisfy the interests of all the races and nations that live there” (p.
228).
“A federation of all the Balkan countries will natu-rally be resisted by European imperialism and tsarism with all their strength.
Their common interest, now as in the past, is aggravation of mutual enmity and rivalry | between these nations and Turkey so as the more easily | N.

The Merton concern grew out of the enterprises of M e r t o n (Anglo-German family).
“Probably m o r e t h a n ' 0 0 m i l l i o n m a r k s have been invested in the Merton concern as a whole, not counting, of course, the private property of the capital-ists behind it” (p.
121).
“Through its enterprises, particularly those of the Merton concern, the Frankfurt metal trade which, incidentally, includes also some other firms of considerable importance, embraces, therefore, virtually the whole world” (p.
122).
D i a g r a m (p.
120) (town names added): [see p.

] Trading capital (of Merton) has passed here into productive capital.
“The characteristic feature of modern wholesale trade in almost all its branches is its penetration into production” (p.
111).
After the electrical industry (Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft in Germany, the General Electric Company in the U.
S.
A.
, etc.
), probably “the most international branch of enterprise in Germany” (109) is the trade inmetals (especially copper, zinc, lead, and rare metals—the chief centre of which is Frankfurt).
The present head, Dr.
Wilhelm Merton (member of the board of most of the companies), is in Frankfurt.
His father, H e n r y R.
M e r t o n, is in London.
The chief difference between all these companies and other similar ones is that the capitalists at the head of the business still have a direct (p.
119) part in all trading and production enterprises.
They “supplement” their capital by capital from the public.
Of course, the number of “companies” in which they have “holdings” is immeasurably greater than shown in the diagram.

) The entry of a particular enterprise into a cartel is a business act decided by considerations of profit.
Like the operation of cartels in general, its implications are felt mainly in periods of depression.
Conflicts between cartels and outsiders arise chiefly because of the differing impact restriction of trade outlets, the inevitable result of the cartel activity, has on individual enterprises.
Restric-tion of trade outlets has a particularly severe impact on enterprises capable of expansion, which is why their resistance is the strongest” (pp.
25-26).

“The difference between the two concepts” (cartel and trust) “is really one of ownership: various owners in the cartel, only one in the trust” (p.
53 and a reference to Liefmann).
“It has been repeatedly established—and this can be regarded as a general phenomenon—that the profitability resulting from cartelisation attracts new entrepreneurs and new capital into the industry” (57).
For example, the Potas-sium Syndicate raised prices.
Result: in 1879 there were 4 enterprises 13 ” 1898 ” ” ” (p.

“Jeidels (p.

“Even in the purely economic sphere a certain change is taking place from commercial activity in the old sense of the word towards organisational-speculative activity.
The greatest success no longer goes to the merchant whose technical and commercial experience enables him best of all to estimate the needs of the buyer, and who is able to dis-cover and, so to speak, ‘awaken’ a latent demand; it goes to the speculative genius who knows how to estimate, or even only to sense in advance, the organisational develop-ment and the possibilities of certain connections between individual enterprises and the banks.

* “The heads of the big firms are able at any time | to enlist the services of the most learned and skilful | lawyers, and if they themselves are not highly versed | in commercial matters, they can enlist the aid of | outstanding businessmen.

The formation of cartels—and this has been estab-lished in the case of those formed so far—leads to an alteration of prices, and also incomes, in favour of heavy or raw-materials industry and to the detriment ||| of manufacturing industry.
The prolonged raising ||| of prices which results from the formation of cartels ||| has hitherto been observed only in respect of the ||| N.
B.
most important means of production, particularly ||| coal, iron and potassium, but never in respect of manu-||| factured goods.
Similarly, the increase in profits ||| resulting from this raising of prices has been limited only to the industries which produce means of produc-tion.
To this observation we must add that the indus-tries which process raw materials (and not semi-manufactures) not only secure advantages from the cartel formation in the shape of high profits, to the detriment of the finished goods industry, but have also secured a dominating position over the latter, which did not exist under free competition” (p.
204).
* Cartels, says Kestner, do not always lead to concentration (they may “rescue” small establishments joining the cartel), but the cartel always leads to “intensification of capital” (274) .
.
.
to an enhanced role of rich, big-capital enterprises (272 and 274).
Regarding the importance of cartels one should not overlook, Kestner says, the difference between an organisa-tion, say, of consumers (this is socialism, p.
282), and an organisation of manufacturing or raw-materials industries.
“The present situation, the dependence of a much bigger section of industry on the output of raw materials, has a certain superficial resemblance to it [to a union of consu-mers, etc.
] ** but internally it is the exact opposite” (p.
282).
((Liefmann, he says, constantly overlooks this difference— note, p.
8.
)) “It is a matter of dispute whether cartels have led to an improvement of the workers’ position, as is asserted by some and contested by others, and whether they embody a co-operative democratic principle” ((Tschierschky!! The * Ibid .

* Current A c c o u n t s —a means of exerting influence on industry.
“How great the banks’ influence over their clients is shown, for example, by the fol-lowing letter, reproduced from the Kuxen-zeitung, sent on November 19, 1901 by the Dresdner Bank to the Board of the German North-West Cement Syndicate.
The letter states: “As we learn from the notice you pub-lished in the newspaper Reichsanzeiger of November 18, we must reckon with the possi-bility that the next general meeting of your syndicate, to be held on the 30th of this month, may decide on measures which are likely to effect changes in your enterprise which are unacceptable to us.
We deeply regret that, for these reasons, we are obliged henceforth to withdraw the credit which has hitherto been allowed you.
Accordingly, we ask you to cease requests for money from our bank and at the same time we respect-fully ask you to return not later than the end of the-current month the sums owing to us.
But if the said next general meeting does not decide upon measures which are unacceptable to us, and if we receive suitable guarantees on this matter for the future, we shall be quite willing to open negotiations with you on the grant of a new credit”** (146-47).

A typical example—not to cite numerous instances from a more remote period— is the gunpowder industry.
Already in the seven-ties, 19 gunpowder factories merged in a single joint-stock company.
In 1890, this merged with its most powerful rival to form the Verei-nigte Köln-Rottweiler Pulverfabriken.
This big joint-stock company then formed cartels not only with other gunpowder factories, but also with the dynamite trust mentioned above.
Thus there was formed quite a modern amal-gamation of all the German explosives factories, which, together with the similarly organised division French and American explosives factories, have of the divided the whole world among themselves, so world to speak” (p.

ha-ha!! Saint-Simon what Marxism!!! “If, however, this is so, then the national welfare requires the development of a new spiritual type of bank magnate whose abstract [ha-ha!] urge for profit is permeated by national-political and therefore national-eco-nomic considerations.

“If we imagine the development of those tendencies we have noted carried to their logical conclusions we will have: the money capital of the nation united in the banks; the banks themselves combined into cartels; the investment capital of the nation cast in the shape of securities.
Then the forecast of that genius Saint-Simon will be fulfilled: ‘The present anarchy of production, which corres-ponds to the fact that economic relations are developing without uniform regulation, must make way for organisation in production.
Production will no longer be directed by iso-lated manufacturers, independent of each other and ignorant of man’s economic needs; that will be done by a certain public insti-tution.
A central committee of management, being able to survey the large field of social economy from a more elevated point of view, will regulate it for the benefit of the whole of society, will put the means of production into suitable hands, and above all will take care that there be constant harmony between production and consumption.
Institutions al-ready exist which have assumed as part of their functions a certain organisation of economic labour, the banks.
’ We are still a long way from the fulfilment of Saint -Simon’s forecast, but we are on the way towards it: Marxism, different from what Marx imagined, but different only in form!” (146) * * See present edition, Vol .

At the present time a few big banks can to a certain extent determine the course of our econo-mic development.
Hence their economic responsibility to the shareholders becomes a national economic responsibility in relation to the state as a whole.

“At the end of 1909, the nine big Berlin banks, together with their affiliated banks, controlled 11,300,000,000 marks, that is, about 8 3 per cent of total German bank capital.
The Deutsche Bank, which together with its affiliated banks controls nearly 3 , 0 0 0, 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 marks, represents, par-allel to the Prussian State Railway Admin-istration, the biggest and also the most decentralised accumulation of capital in the Old World” (137).

Agreements between banks: the Darmstäd-ter Bank wanted to conclude an agreement with the city of Berlin on “revenue-use” of the Tempelhof area, at a 10 per cent profit.

“The Frankfurter Zeitung (May 2, 1914) greeted the fusion of the Discontogesellschaft with the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein with the following words: “ ‘The concentration movement of the banks is narrowing the circle of establishments from which it is possible to obtain credits, and is consequently increasing the dependence of big industry upon a small number of bank-ing groups.
In view of the close connection between industry and the financial world, the freedom of movement of industrial com-panies which need banking capital is res-tricted.
For this reason, big industry is watching the growing trustification of the banks with mixed feelings.
Indeed, we have repeatedly seen the beginnings of certain agreements between the individual big bank-ing concerns, which aim at restricting com-petition’” (p.
155).

Quoting facts confirming “export stipulations” and the benefit accruing to industry from foreign investments, Schulze-Gaevernitz says, incidentally, that France also benefits from this: “The French rentier state is thus experienc-||||| ing a second industrial flowering”—the float-||||| ||||| ing of the Turkish loan in 1910 was made character-conditional on Turkey not giving to any coun-istic!!! try m o r e orders than to France.

“a) The creditor states: France, Great Brit-ain, Germany.
Great Britain and France, the two big creditor powers of the world, are political bankers.
The state and the banking community act as one and the same person.
Such is the French Government and the Crédit Lyonnais.
Such is the friendship of Edward VII and Sir E.
Cassel.
Hoping to win the main prize in the political lottery, France staked thousands of millions of francs, on the Russian card alone.
Russia, by obtain-ing money from France, was even able to act as a political loan giver in the Far East— in China and in Persia.
France, as a loan giver, had a hold over Spain and Italy, and as her clients they helped her in Algeciras.
France was prepared to extend to the Kossuth ministry loans she refused to Count Kuehn: ‘the earnest-money would have been the Triple Alliance’.
As a political creditor, Great Britain cemented afresh the British world empire, without fear of pressure on the current value of her Consols.
The guaranteed safety afforded colonial state loans in the metropolis enabled, for example, such a half-opened-up new country as Natal to enjoy cheap-er credit than long-consolidated, highly respectable Prussia with her gigantic property in railways and state lands.
This credit nexus is a ‘bond of interests’, stronger, per-haps, than Chamberlain’s preferential tariffs would ever have been.
Going beyond the imperial connections, the British creditor keeps Japan in political vassalage, Argentina in colonial dependence, and Portugal in uncon-cealed debt bondage.
The governors of Portu-guese Africa, for all their gold braid, are British puppets” (165).

“All the more soberly, therefore, must we regard the fact that we have arrived late on the scene.

From T h .
V o g e l s t e i n ’s article “Financial Or-ganisation of Capitalist Industry and Formation of Monopolies”.
“Ten years after May 9, 1873, when, in Schönlank’s exaggerated expression, the bells tolled the death of the economic boom and N.
B.
the birth of cartels, Fr.
Kleinwächter pub-lished his book on cartels” (216).
From the history of cartels: “Isolated examples of capitalist monopoly could be cited from the period preceding 1860; in these could be discerned the embryo of the forms that are so common today; but all this undoubtedly represents the prehistory of cartels.
The real beginning of modern monopoly goes back, at the earliest, to the sixties.
The first important period of develop-ment of monopoly commenced with the inter-national industrial depression of the seventies N.
B.
and lasted until the beginning of the nineties” (222).
“If we examine the question on a European scale, we will find that the development of N.
B.
free competition reached its apex in the sixtiesand seventies.
It was then that Britain com-pleted the construction of her old-style capitalist organisation.
In Germany, this organisation entered into a fierce struggle with handicraft and domestic industry, and began to create for itself its own forms of existence” (ibidem).
“The great revolution commenced with the crash of 1873, or rather, the depression which followed it and which—with hardly discernible interruptions in the early eighties, and an unusually violent but short-lived boom about 1889— occupies twenty-two years of European economic history” (222).
.
.
.
.
.
.
“During the short boom of 1889-90, the system of cartels was widely resorted to in order to take advantage of favour-able business conditions.
An ill-considered policy sent prices soaring more rapidly and steeply than would have been the case if there had been no cartels, and nearly all these cartels ended ingloriously in the ‘grave of bankruptcy’.
Another five-year period of bad trade and low prices fol-lowed, but a new spirit reigned in industry.
The depression was no longer regarded as something to be taken for granted; it was regarded merely as a pause before another boom.
“The cartel movement entered its second second |||| epoch |||| epoch: from a transitory phenomenon, the |||| cartels became one of the foundations of econo-of cartels |||| mic life.
They were winning one industry after another, primarily, the industries processing raw materials.
By the early nineties the cartel system had already acquired—in the organi-||| sation of the coke syndicate, on the model ||| of which the coal syndicate was later formed— ||| a cartel technique which has hardly been N.
B.
||| improved on.
For the first time the great boom ||| at the close of the nineteenth century and ||| ||| the crisis of 1900-03 occurred entirely—in the ||| mining and iron industries at least—within ||| a cartel economy.
And while at that time it appeared to be something novel, now the general public takes it for granted that large spheres of economic life have been, as a generalrule, removed from the realm of free compe-tition” (224).

Note on “Banks and the Post Office”.
The boundary between the banks and the savings banks “is being increasingly obliterated”.
Hence c o m p l a i n t s by the banks.
The Erfurt Chamber of Commerce speaks in favour of the banks against the “recent intervention of the post office in cur-rency circulation” (in the form of the “issue of postal letters of credit”).
The editors remark that postal letters of credit operate only within the German Empire, whereas bank letters of credit serve mainly persons going abroad, and “after all, the public exists not only for the sake of the banks” (714).

From the article “Thoughts on the Thousand Million Loan”, p.
932: “A subscriber to the loan possesses liquid assets, but mostly in the form not of cash, but of a bank account or a savings bank, association, etc.
deposit.
In Germany these institutions control, in round figures, 35,000 million marks of such liquid assets, about half of which are at the immediate disposal of their owners, while the other half are available to them after preliminary notification—mostly after a month” (933).
What is involved is the transfer of ownership from private persons’ accounts to the state’s account (and vice versa in paying suppliers, etc.
).
The credit institutions as a whole dispose of “not more than 500 million marks”, on the basis of “their total cash and deposits in the State Bank” (933).
In 1871, France paid 5,000 million in such a way that only 742.
3 million was paid in gold, silver and banknotes, the remainder (4,248.
3 million) being in bills.
(France recovered so rapidly in 1870–71 because she did not tamper with her currency and made no excessive issue of “uncovered banknotes”.

A very good article, explaining the causes of Britain’s power.
The chief cause: “the absolute predominance of British trade and currency circulation over the trade of all other countries” (909).
It exceeds German trade “by 50 per cent in round figures” (ibidem).
In addition, there is the trade with the colonies!! “B r i t a i n a c c o u n t s f o r t h r e e -q u a r t e r s o f N.
B.
world trade ” (910).
“This means that three-quarters of all international payments pass directly or indirectly through Great Britain” (910).
“Sterling accounts” “predominate” also in Japan, China, Chile, Peru, South Persia, “the greater part of Turkey (910).
— “Knowledge of English is widespread in commercial circles” (910).
Furthermore, Britain finances this trade of the whole world(the lowest rate of interest; the most stable gold currency; one pound sterling = 7 3 grams of g o l d , etc.
, etc.
).
Great Britain’s “vast” monetary resources, her 6 0 colo-nial banks (911), etc.
, etc.

! in London.
” p.
912, note: “Regarding the difficulties encountered by German overseas banks in introducing bills of exchange in marks in South America, cf.
Jaffé, British Banks, second edition, 98-101, Frankfurter Zeitung, August 29, 1914; Hamburger Nachrichten, September 15, 1914” (I omit other quotations).
“For every country adopting a currency based on gold and holding, as occurs almost everywhere, a large portfolio of British bills of exchange in place of gold, not only subor-dinates a greater part of its international payments to the London Clearing House, but thereby also immediately assists the consolidation of British world financial power.
The continual holding of a large portfolio of British bills of exchange means, in practice, that the country in question puts considerable resources at London’s disposal, which for its part London can, and does, use to further finance the foreign trade of other countries and in this way strength-en its own sterling currency and its own clearing function.
Thus, owing to the gold value of the pound sterling, Great Britain is always able to put at the service of her credit system, besides her own large capital assets, also several thousand million marks of foreign money” (913-14).
To deprive Britain of this role requires “huge financial resources and a low rate of interest” (916).
.
.
“And one must be in a position not only to pay out vast sums of money, but also to guarantee the absolute stability of the currency that is to replace the British, that is, one must be prepared at any time to pay in gold.
” Hence, the term “utopian” is applied to the plan of the National City Bank (Morgan’s Bank) 10 or the Swiss banks,“which believe that a little good will is quite sufficient to wrest from London the international clearing accounts, or a considerable part of them.
That is indeed a highly desirable aim, but it cannot be achieved until some other country can put at the service of world trade the amount of credit, the complex of commercial, banking and interest advantages, and the reliable currency foundation, which, prior to the outbreak of the war at least, Britain put at the disposal of world trade” (920).

) “The Covering of War Costs and Its Sources”, an article by Alfred Lansburgh.
Quotes Lloyd George as saying (in September 1914): “In my judgement, the last few hundred millions may win this war.
This is my opinion.
The first hundred millions our enemies can stand just as well as we can, but the last they cannot, thank God.
.
.
” (p.
998).
Says Lloyd George is mistaken.
There are four sources for covering war costs: (1) “First degree” reserves = cash (France and Russia have more than Germany, but Britain less.
Here Germany is weaker).
(2) “Second degree” reserves: short-term debt claims in world trade (Britain is much stronger: “Whereas Britain is the world’s banker and keeps her money liquid, France is the world’s financier and invests her money”) (1001).
(3) Net income from the country’s production & (4) part of gross income devoted to deprecia-tion (or accumulation).
Here, he says, we are not weaker.
In this connection, however, Lansburgh is counting on exports which though secret (“hidden”), will not disappear.
Our (Germany’s) low discount rate proves (December 1914!!!), he says, that exports are inadequate, do not cor-respond to “our expenditure abroad” (1103).
Cf.
p.
1112: “Only when exports suffice fully to N.

cover imports and war expenditure abroad will the national economy be really on a war footing.

The Discontogesellschaft swallowed up the Schaaffhaus-enscher Bankverein and increased its share capital to 3 0 0 m i l l i o n marks (p.
415).
* “Thus for the first time a really big German bank has become a victim of the concentration process” (415).
The Deutsche Bank increased its capital to 50,000,000 marks.
The Discontogesellschaft replied to this by a “merger” with the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein and increased its capital to 3 0 0,000,000.
** “With a capital of 300,000,000 marks, it becomes, for the time being, the biggest bank not only in Germany, but in the world” (422).
The “struggle for hegemony”, which had seemed decided in favour of the Deutsche Bank, now flared up afresh: || “Other banks will follow this same path .
.
.
and || || the three hundred men, who today govern Germany || N.
B.
|| economically, will gradually be reduced to fifty, || || twenty-five, or still fewer.
It cannot be expected that || this latest move towards concentration will be con-fined to banking.
The close relations that exist between individual banks naturally lead to the bringing together of the industrial syndicates these banks favour.
This, and business fluctuations, will lead to still more mergers, and one fine morning we shall wake up in surprise to see nothing but trusts before | our eyes, and to find ourselves faced with the necessity |||| |||| | of substituting state monopolies for private monopolies.
|||| N.
B.
| However, we have nothing to reproach ourselves |||| |||| with, except that we have allowed things to follow their own course, slightly accelerated by the manipula-tion of stocks” (426).

(May 1914).
Early in 1912, the big banks (yielding to the pressure of the State Bank) introduced a n e w type of balance-sheet.

But thousands of joint-stock companies continue to publish brief (“knappe”) balance-sheets, not going beyond the requirements of the law—the brevity of the balance-sheet being alleged to be a guarantee against speculation!!! In fact, however: “In reality, what is achieved by this [the “brevity of balance-sheet”] is merely that a few better-informed || persons are able to enrich themselves at the expense of the || mass of shareholders, especially if brevity is combined || with a subtle system of misleading headings to make || important data invisible to the ordinary shareholder.
This gives the directors and their good friends a double advantage: being sole possessors of all information, they || can benefit from a rise in market values in favourable || situations, and escape anticipated losses by a timely sale || of shares in unfavourable ones.
“Thus, for example, the Spring-Steel Com-pany of Kassel was regarded some years ago as being one of the most profitable enterprises in Germany.
Through bad management its dividends fell in a few years from 15 per good cent to nil.
It appears that the Board, without example! consulting the shareholders, had loaned six million marks to one of its ‘subsidiary com-panies’, the Hassia Company, which had a nominal capital of only some hundreds of thousands of marks.
This commitment, amount-ing to nearly treble the capital of the ‘parent company’, was never mentioned in its balance-sheet; this omission was quite legal and could be hushed up for two whole years because it did not violate any point of com-pany law.
The chairman of the Supervisory Board, who as the responsible head had !!! signed the false balance-sheets, was, and still is, the president of the Kassel Chamber of Commerce.
The shareholders learned of the Hassia loan only much later, after it had been proved to be a mistake and when Spring-Steel shares dropped nearly 100 per cent, because those in the know were getting ridof them.
It was only then that the item in question was made evident by a change in the method of drawing up the balance-sheet.
This typical example of balance-sheet juggle-|| N.
B.
ry, quite common in joint-stock companies, || explains why their Boards of Directors are || willing to undertake risky transactions with a far lighter heart than individual business-men.
Modern methods of drawing up balance-sheets not only make it possible to conceal the risky deal from the ordinary shareholder, but also allow the main interested parties to escape the consequence of an unsuccessful || experiment, by selling their shares in time, || whereas the individual businessman risks || his own skin in everything he does” (545).
.
.
.
|| “The balance-sheets of many joint-stock companies remind us of the palimpsests of the Middle Ages from which the visible inscription had first to be erased in  order to discover beneath it another inscription giving the real meaning of the document” (545).
.
.
.
A palimpsest is a parchment from which the original inscription has been erased and then another inscrip- tion imposed.
.
.
.
“The simplest and, therefore, most common proce-dure for making balance-sheets indecipherable is to divide a single business into several parts by setting up or attaching ‘subsidiary companies’.
The advantages of this system for various purposes—legal and illegal— || are so evident that today big companies which do not || || employ it are quite the exception” * (545-46).
This assures “a certain impenetrability of their opera-tions” (ibidem).
.
.
.
An outstanding example is the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft (with thousands of millions of marks in sub-sidiary companies).

good example! || The formation is expected (perhaps in the || near future) of a Berlin “transport trust”, i.
e.
, || an interest-community of the three Berlin || transport companies—the elevated railway, || tramway, and omnibus companies.
We have been aware that this plan was contemplated ever since it became known that the majority of shares in the omnibus company had been acquired by the other two transport compa-nies.
.
.
.
We may fully believe those who are pursuing this aim when they say that by uniting the transport services they will have economies, part of which will in time benefit the public.
But the question is complicated by the fact that behind the transport trust that is being formed are the banks, which, || if they desire, can subordinate the means of || transportation, which they have monopolised, !! || to the interests of their real estate business.
To be convinced of the reasonableness of such a conjecture, we need only recall that the interests of the big bank that encouraged the formation of the Elevated Railway Com-pany were already involved at the time the company was formed.
Indeed, the interests ||| of this transport undertaking were interlocked N.
B.
||| with the real estate interests and so an essen-||| tial prerequisite for the foundation of the transport company was created.
The point is that the eastern line of this railway was to run across land which, when it became | | certain that the railway was to be construct-| | ed, this bank sold at an enormous profit !! | | for itself and some persons associated with it in the land company at the Schönhauser Allee railway station.

British free trade has been based both on her mili-tary might (the navy) and colonies.
True, an attitude of indifference to maintaining and increasing colonial possessions prevailed in Britain up to 1860s (in 1864, she even gave Greece the Ionian Islands gratis, without political or economic compensation).

“More interesting and perhaps even more significant than the examples so far mentioned [Egypt, Zanzibar.
.
.
], where subtropical or tropical semi-civilised countries, after relatively short transitional stages of some few decades, have become or appear to be becoming real British colonies, are a number of other cases.
These are cases where for a long time, decades or even centuries, a country with a European civilisation may virtually be a British protectorate, without, at least formally, being deprived of any external mark of full sovereignty.
“Portugal is the best known and outstanding example.
Since the war of the Spanish Succession (1700-14) Great KKK KKKBritain has almost continuously used her navy, and on occasion her army, to defend Portugal’s European or over-seas possessions from attacks or claims by Spain, France, etc.
Conflicts between Britain, the protector, and Portugal, the protected, were accidental and, to a certain extent, family quarrels .
.
.
as, for example, the British ultimatum of January 11, 1890, against Portugal’s attempts to land-link her western and eastern colonies in Africa.
“At any rate, only British support enables Portugal to maintain her possessions—which, though not large, are nevertheless important for such a small country—on the west coast of India, in South China (Macao) and on Timor, in face of the intense international political rivalry in southern and eastern Asia.
In Portuguese East Africa a kind of customs union with British South Africa has even been added to Britain’s political protectorate over Portugal” (treaty of December 18, 1901).
.
.
.
“And it has so far proved economically highly profitable for Portuguese East Africa.
It is also a valuable acquisition, now and for the future, for British South Africa and, therefore, for Great Britain.
“This virtual protectorate of Great Britain over Portu-gal during its more than two hundred years’ existence has proved extremely useful to British trade and shipping [the 1703 treaty with Portugal].
.
.
.
“However, ever since Great Britain adopted peaceful free trade, she has been able through diplomatic action to influence the Portuguese customs tariff in a way hardly to be achieved by any other country, even by the offer of commercial privileges or the threat of a tariff war.
Besides, as the dominating power, Great Britain can make especially wide use of all export and investment opportunities involv-ing Portuguese government concessions” (railways in Por-tuguese Africa, etc.
).
.
.
.
“And indirectly, again owing to her protectorate over Portugal, Great Britain maintains not only her position in South Africa and her influence in the Congo, but also her maritime supremacy, the firm pillar of her colonial and world-wide political and economic power.
For in war or peace, Portugal puts her ports and islands at the disposal of the British fleet for training purposes and as intermediateshipping stations, allows the use of telegraph cables, etc.

The union of the modern gigantic world states into a single economic whole is stated to be an “ap-proach” to “u n i v e r s a l f r e e t r a d e”.
“As far back as the eighteenth century, after the secession of the North American colonies from Great Britain, it became apparent to the more far-sighted colonial peoples that such a brutal colonial policy [suppression of all industry in the colony] aimed exclusively at promoting the real or apparent interests of export of manufactures from the metropolis, could not be maintained for long.
At any rate, that applied to regions of the temperate zone with active, intel-ligent populations whose living conditions do not substantially differ from those of European nations.
In the tropical and subtropical regions, however, with populations at a lower cultural level, less ener-getic and militarily and politically weaker, this old colonial policy was still retained, even though to a lesser extent.
True, nowadays, in both the tropics and subtropics, outright suppression of incipient industrial activity is as a rule avoided.
But in most * See p .

| cases colonial governments devote more attention to | developing agricultural and mining raw-material out-| put than to industrial and political problems.
And that | for the most part they can do this without much damage | to the economic development of the tropical or sub-| tropical areas concerned is all the more important, since | this enables them to operate this type of colonial | | policy for a long time.
For the present acute political | rivalry throughout the world, and the emergence of | overseas Great Powers (U.
S.
A.
, Japan), afford the | population of the tropics and subtropics—resentful N.
B.
| at the forcible, ruinous retarding of its economic | development—many means of creating difficulties for N.

| its oppressors and of giving them a distaste for brutal | methods of rule” (240-41).
For example, Britain is more and more converting || Egypt into a country producing o n l y cotton (in N.
B.
|| 1904, of 2,300,000 hectares of cultivated land, 600,000 || were under cotton) and hampering industrial develop-ment (for instance, two cotton textile mills founded in Egypt in 1901 were made to pay the cotton t a x , that is, the government imposed a “consumers’ tax” on cotton!!!) (244-45).
“Present-day colonial policy”.
In general, “modern” colonial policy is supposed | to encourage production of raw materials and react | to the development of industry “with indifference, | if not with hostility” (247).
“However, it is probably no longer possible to N.
B.
apply that type of colonial policy to the physically and intellectually more vigorous peoples of temperate climates; it can be applied only to the weaker peoples of the tropics and, in part, the subtropics.
But even here it can be carried out only by the more powerful European metropolitan countries, Great Britain, France and Germany.
The Netherlands, Spain and Portu-gal, on the other hand, have lost some of their colo-nial possessions and are able to retain others only because of the good will and mutual rivalry of the N.
B.
big colonial powers.
Belgium is a notable example.
“.

.
But even the strongest colonial power, Great ||| Britain, in its biggest and most important colony, ||| India, is compelled to depart considerably from ||| strict observance of the above—mentioned principle ||| N.

in its trade and industrial policy, so as not to make N.

||| In Egypt, the population is much more homogeneous (in language, nationality, etc.
) than in India, “and the country (Egypt) is more European than, for instance, some areas || || of European Russia” (252).

Germany waged a tariff war against Canada (from July 31, 1898 to March 1, 1910) because of the latter’s preferential tariffs in favour of Britain.
It ended with the retention of these tariffs and a customs treaty with Germany.
Most British, Dutch and German colonies, “as far as can be foreseen”, will remain under the open-door regime in relation to a a l l countries (271).
Trescher (Preferential Tariffs, 1908) contested this, and Schilder says that he has toned down his conclusions.
As regards state contracts (269-70), the custom every-where is: preference for “one’s own” country.
“‘ O p e n -d o o r ’ a r e a s ” (old type: Turkey (until 1908), Rumania, Bulgaria, Egypt, Morocco, Persia; new type: Congo, Afghanistan) “are almost always independent or, at least, formally independent states, and in most cases semi-civilised countries” .

On the whole, this phenomenon is not so frequent as that indicated under point 1” (274).

The author gives the table only on pp.
381-82 (without & and —), the remaining figures (capital investment) from The Statist are only in the text, moreover (curiously!), while giving annual data on imports for 1870-1911, he does not compute them in seven-year periods! The author’s conclusion is that, though the capital investment statistics are not fully accurate (none of private capital investments), they adequately show the correlation (between the decline in the excess of imports and the growth of capital investment) (p.

The question amounts to this: will the proletariat in the industrial countries be able “to replace or retain the vanishing peasant basis of food and clothing”? “The answer to the clear-cut question must be a downright, clear, remorseless N o !” (207).
209: It is impossible to obtain (in Europe) 200 million sheep 15-20 million bales of cotton, etc.
“There is no point in it (the proletariat) wanting to expro-priate the capitalists, for the industrial means of production are no longer utilisable” (210), and it will not be able to go over to agriculture (211).
.
.
.
“The possibility is thus excluded of a democratic socialism in the sense of a uniform, tightly-knit regulation of production as a whole by the mass of the ! people who possess nothing and rule everything.
.
.
.
Much more probable than the domination of peasant production by an industrial democracy is the domi-nation of industrial production by a peasant democ-! racy” (213).
“However, the realisation of democratic socialism through an industrial democracy is absolutely ruled out if we accept: “1.
that peasant economy holds sway in the most ? important spheres of organic production; “2.
that the peasant masses hold fast to the private basis of production; “3.
that the peasant countries naturally endeavour to draw into their sphere the greatest possible share of industrial production; “4.
that, under the prevailing conditions of inter-national competition, especially with the Chinese quarter of mankind drawn into the nexus of world economy, and with the conversion of other hitherto agrarian countries into industrial states, they can ? quite freely dispose of their industrial incomes which have already been monopolised not by them (215);“5.
that, on the other hand, the industrial states are to a growing extent dependent on foreign peasant bases for their supplies of food and clothing raw materials” (216).

“The unfortunate thing is that the industriali-sation of the East, following the penetration of !?! Western technical culture, can proceed much faster than the agrarianisation of the West, with its industrial over-tension and, it can be safely said, its industrial degeneration” (219).

Economic conditions and forms of trusts dealt with at length.
p.
48: “The chief rival of the Steel Trust, the Jones and Laughlin Co.
of Pittsburgh, is said to have more modern equipment in its mills than the Trust.
—Leather trust shareholders blamed the board for the business doing badly, because it had neglected the technical equipment of the factories.
The harvester-machine trust was praised for sparing no expense to equip its factories with the most up-to-date machinery in order to reduce production costs and thereby raise competitive power.
[Quoted from Kartell-rundschau, 1910, pp.
53 and 902.
] “The tobacco trust has gone the farthest, perhaps, in this direction.
An official report says: ‘The trust’s superiority over competitors is due to the magnitude of its enterprises and their excellent technical equip-ment.
Since its inception, the tobacco trust has devot-ed all its efforts to the universal substitution of mechanical for manual labour.
With this end in view it has bought up all patents that have anything to do with the manufacture of tobacco and has spent enormous sums for this purpose.
Many of these patents at first proved to be of no use, and had to be modified by the engineers employed by the trust.
At the end of 1906, two subsidiary companies were formed solely to acquire patents.
With the same object in view, the trust has built its own foundries, machine shops and repair shops.
One of these establishments, that in Brooklyn, employs on the average 300 workers; here experiments are carried out on inventions concerning the manufacture of cigarettes, cheroots, snuff, tinfoil N.
B.
for packing, boxes, etc.
Here, also, inventions are perfected.
’” * (Report of the Commissioner of Corpo-rations on the Tobacco Industry, Washington, 1909, p.
266.
) “It is quite obvious that such a policy greatly stimulates technical progress.
Other trusts also employ what are called development engineers whose business it is to devise new methods of production and to test technical improve-ments.
The Steel Trust grants big bonuses to its workers and engineers for all inventions that raise technical efficiency, or reduce cost of production.
” ** Besides competition, the bad financial circumstances of the majority of trusts (owing to over-capitalisation (N.
B.
)) are a stimulus to technical progress.
The capital of the Steel Trust = about $1,000 million (“one-seventh of the total national prop-||| erty”).

KAUTSKY VERSUS IMPERIALISM N.
B.
Kautsky on Imperialism Hobson’s book on imperialism is useful in general, and especially useful because it helps to reveal the basic falsity of Kautskyism on this subject.
Imperialism continually gives rise to capitalism anew (from the barter economy of the colonies and backward countries), giving rise anew to transitions from small-scale to large-scale capitalism, from weakly developed to highly developed commodity exchange, etc.
, etc.
The Kautskyites (K.
Kautsky, S p e c t a t o r and Co.
) quote these facts about “healthy”, “peaceful” capital-ism, based on “peaceful relations”, and counterpose them to financial robbery, banking monopolies, deals by the banks with the state, colonial oppression, etc.
; they coun-terpose them as the normal to the abnormal, the desirable to the undesirable, the progressive to the reactionary, the fundamental to the accidental, etc.
This is the new Proudhonism.

“However, the total amount of ‘panic-struck capital’ must have been much larger.

“Nevertheless, it can be assumed that a conside-rable part of the cash sent abroad returned in the form of Russian annuities.
Even if one puts this ||| at only 500 million rubles, the amount of ‘panic-||| N.
B.

.

.
“The danger of a fall in the value of the ruble, | and a financial crisis, which was developing at the | close of 1905, were averted when the Russian syn-| dicate in Paris, with the participation of the Brit-| N.
B.
ish money market, took up the 5 per cent loan in | | the spring of 1906.
“The government treasury thus received almost one thousand million rubles in cash.
In the following quiet years of 1907-08 the banks and the state treas-| ury were in a very favourable position, that is | to say, cash was freely available, the force of facts | had powerfully stimulated thinking, and something sensible could be created on a realistic basis,—if desired.
“These two years had a beneficial effect on trade and industry as well, and led to improvement and reconstruction.
Private industry, i.
e.
, industry not dependent on government orders (oil, sugar, textiles, paper, timber), remained thoroughly | healthy, and it was only the labour question that as-| sumed quite a different, i.

“The years of change, 1905-08, caused many Russian capitalists to deposit their liquid money in German banks”.

(see above).
“Things went so far that one of the most con-servative (and most independent) Russian banks bought Prussian Consols as a reserve against un-sic!! foreseen developments.
“At that time (1906) the Russian banks were not par-ticularly rich in cash.
—The intense peasant movement had caused much damage in the villages; the workers || in the towns, however, had left trade and industry N.

The fact is well known that, in spite of the numerous strikes, there were only a few acts of sabotage against private prop-erty and warehouses belonging to trade and indus-try (the sabotage in Baku should be attributed to Armenians and Tatars) (apart from the gross disorders on the railways, which, however, should not be ascribed to the free workers).

9 “Berlin financial circles particularly weakened their relations with Russian private industry in 1905-06, that is, precisely when there was a large flow of cash from all parts of Russia.
Until then the Lodz weaving and spinning mills (mostly Ger-man-owned) had depended mainly on the Berlin financial market and had always been good clients; nevertheless the Berlin banks deprived these firms of considerable credits, forcing many of them not only substantially to reduce production, but even send a consortium of very wealthy Lodz textile industrialists to the Caucasus to take part in mining enterprises there and seek contacts with the London and even the New York market.
Contacts were not established chiefly due to the pogroms which took place at that time” (67).

“It should be borne in mind, that Russia’s losses in the Japanese war, including Port Arthur, Dalny and the southern part of the Chinese-Eastern railway, amounted to approximately 4,500 million rubles, i.

“Statistically, from the German standpoint, the operation appears as follows: “Increase of capital since 1906-07: 16,000,000 rubles—nominal share capital at the average market price of about 200 (when put on the Berlin Stock Exchange) 10,000,000—from issues on reserve account 26,000,000—in all 32,000,000—actual capital at 200 ||| 6,000,000 rubles—difference—middleman’s prof-6 million ||| it in favour of the Deutsche Bank and its rubles ||| clients” (78).

“that the bank’s director-general (a certain Soloveichik, con-nected by family ties with one of the Deutsche Bank directors) had put to his own private account seven !! million rubles of government subsidies and had used the money to buy shares of his own bank and thus acquire the majority of votes needed for his re-election” (79).

“If it is borne in mind that Ger-man capital operates here, and that such business methods are encouraged by the famous Deutsche Bank, increased importance attaches to the conclu-sion which I am endeavouring to prove in this book, viz.
, that the ‘holdings system’ prevents even a seri-ous Russian side from ensuring a sound and orderly management of the credit institutions that are so important to Russia.
The Deutsche Bank is, of course, in a position to procure for itself a majority of votes, but the Russian shareholders, who also !! participate in the bank, will never be able to secure a majority sufficient to put into practice their just wishes and reasonable views” (80).

) Russian Ministers of Finance | appoint bank directors (often from government | officials), give the banks millions in subsidies | through the “Credit Office”, etc.
“This gives the key to the activity of those St.
Petersburg banks—‘Russian’ in their exter-nal appearance, ‘foreign’ in the sources of their funds, ‘dilettante’ in their conduct of business, and ‘ministerial’ in the risks they take—which have grown into parasites of Russian economic life.
—And this precedent [reference is to the Siberian Bank, etc.
] has now become a principle of organisation for the St.
Petersburg banks.
The Berlin and Paris directors of the big banks believe that the following guarantee their interests “1) the direct Credit Office subsidies to St.
Petersburg banks, || “2) the credit balance of the Russian Finance || Ministry (of which about 60 per cent is in Paris || and 40 per cent in Berlin)” (137).
.
.
.
“The Finance Ministry authorised the Russo-Chinese Bank [in which the author served!!] to issue a series of state-guaranteed securities to provide it with the necessary cash resources, without being concerned as to how these were used.
Thus, for example, it handed over to the bank the issue of state-guaranteed railway || shares in European Russia, and the income || went directly into the bank’s coffers.
The rail-|| ways would need the money gradually, in the | course of 4-5 years (during their construction), || and in the meantime the bank could freely || dispose of the money and, in addition, earnprofit from the issue of the shares.
This became an established procedure, for it was repeated several times each year” (149).
(The shares of four railways total £ 12,800,000 = about 120 million rubles.
) “The director (who is also the president) of the bank is a board member of a number ||| of big railway and industrial companies ||| (at present about 20), which likewise have ||| to keep their free cash on current account ||| in the bank, knowing that the Finance Minis-||| try is greatly interested in the bank and ||| ||| supports it” (149).

B.
!! That is how “business” is done.
.
.
.
This in Chapter 11: “The Merger of the Russo-Chinese Bank with the Northern Bank (Russo-Asiatic Bank) and the Protest against This at the 1910 General Meeting” (p.
147): (the protest was moved by the author himself) “Most of those present at the general meeting of || the Russo-Chinese Bank, which was intended to || N.
B.
!! confirm the merger, were State Bank and Credit || || Office officials holding proxy votes”.
.
.
(153).
The author registered a “ d i s s e n t i n g o p i n i o n ”, entered in the minutes of the meeting of March 30, 1910 (p.
154).
“The holdings system is nonsense”—the author argued in his protest.
.
.
(p.
154).
A “merger” was carried out by the French banks (Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas & Société Générale) which were “interested” in the Russo-Chinese Bank, saw its affairs were in a bad state, wanted to “extricate” themselves and hoped “by the merger [of the two banks into one— the Russo-Asiatic], to create such a big ‘Russian’ N.
B.
!! institution that the Russian government would be compelled to ‘uphold’ the merged bank under all circumstances” (p.
151).
“When the merger took place, the share capital was reduced by 33 per cent and these sums were putto reserve account.
This gave the bank the appear-ance of having created this reserve capital as a result of good business management, while at the same time enabling the new administration in the future to distribute the entire profit (!) on a diminished capital at a higher rate of interest, because the reserve capital had, at one stroke, N.
B.
reached the legal maximum and no interest had to be paid on it.
The shareholders were helpless even against this manipulation, for they were in France, while the general meetings took place in St.
Petersburg”.
.
.
(152).
.
.
.
“When the Russo-Asiatic Bank states that its | | share capital is 45 million rubles and reserve capital | | 23.
3 million rubles, every unprejudiced person will | assume that the reserve has been derived from | earned money, i.
e.
, is the result of good business | management.
In reality, however, it comes out | of share capital, and is the result of bad business !! | management.
Neither bank had reserves prior to the | merger” (153).
.
.
.
And, in fact, this bank, with 120 branches (!!), has too little capital (a balance-sheet of 7 8 5 million rubles with a capital of 73 2 million & !! reserves—October 1, 1913)—“the risk of this overloading has to be borne by the Credit Office” (153).
.
.
.
“Furthermore, it is quite clear that under the ‘holdings system’, which prevents the share-owners from passing judgement on the management | | of the company, because between them and the | | company stand the all-powerful big (foreign) banks, which can use more or less ‘masked combinations’ N.
B.
|| to rob both sides, directors are appointed arbitra-|| rily and according to private interests, so that, ha-ha! in the end, any dilettante can become a bank direc-tor” (156-57).
The board of the Russo-Asiatic Bank consists | | of “a former Russian bureaucrat (as Director-Gener-sic!! | al and President of the bank), a former Russian | Governor, a former French diplomat, and a former | French lawyer” (158).
!! All this criticism is stated to have been written ]] in the autumn of 1913 and to have “become obsolete” ]] ? owing to the Imperial rescript of January 30, 1914.
]] diplomacy? The union of deposit and speculative banks is harmful because it (1) “ties up” the country’s productive means (2) leads to a rise in prices, syndicates, etc.
“If clarity and order were established | ha-ha! in banking conditions, I should indeed | that what it like to see whether there could be trusts, | comes to!! | monopolies and syndicates” (179).
.
.
.
“Let it be legally laid down that firms concluding agreements which militate against the consumer by eliminating com-petition (by dishonest competition) will not ha-ha!! be granted official bank credits and, there-simple!! fore, will not be allowed to issue securities, and then monopolies and syndicates might very soon be dissolved” (180).

“the programme of a modern big bank director is quite clear and obvious; it reads: “If we, the big banks, succeed in ruling over producers and consumers (through stock issues, credit and customs duties), then the profits will flow into our pockets and we become masters of the situation” (Agahd’s italics) (218).
“if” is amusing (“a Narodnik”!) Agahd “forgot” a trifle: capitalism and the capitalist class!! The consequence of this, he says, may be ||| “excessive raising of customs duties” and ||| “even” because of that “open hostility in the world ||| to war market, which could even lead to war, what ||| may also suit the big bank monopolists, || because with the force majeure of war they || one of the can purge their balance-sheets without being || motives held personally responsible for the losses ” || || for war (220).

1% Σ is 100.
1% Here, says Agahd “the bank question, | with which the author (Prokopovich) is not | | familiar”, plays the biggest role.
On the question of Russia’s b a l a n c e o f t r a d e , the author writes that the excess of the credit over the debit side was 1909— 570 mill, rubles (p.
238) 1910— 511 1911— 430 1,371 * — 600 —minus coupon payments abroad of 200 million rubles per annum 771 —“total excess in 3 years”.
“Concerning this sum, therefore, it can be said that it has in part (I put it at 500 million rubles) more than normally enriched the country in cash resources thanks to especially good harvests.
But this figure proves, plainly and obviously, that the apparently gigantic upswing in Russia was by no means due only to favourable harvests.
“To this must be added the import of capital under guaran-teed and private stock issues of about 1,509 million rubles, of which, however, only a negligible amount was put on the market in the form of cash (most of it went into special undertakings).
|| “The director of the Credit Office (Davydov) gives || the following estimate of the growth of the country’s || free working capital (by which he means private || deposits in all the banks, savings-banks deposits || (an increase of 576 million in cash and securities), || current accounts of government agencies in the || State Bank, excluding, however, current accounts || of the Credit Office with foreign bankers and the || debts of Russian banks abroad): || 1906—2,592 million rubles N.
B.
|| 1912—5,000 million rubles” (p.
238).
* So given by Agahd .
—Ed .
The growth, he says = about 2,500 million rubles, and import of capital about 1,600 & 771 (inflow due to good harvests) = 2,371 million rubles (p.
239)—“they approx-imately balance”.

“The Russian Finance Ministry utilises here” (in reference to Russia’s excessive gold reserve) “its cash just as unscientifically, | just as unsoundly from the economic stand-| point, just as anti-nationally as most of the | continental big banks in Berlin and Paris use is it not their deposits.
Russian government money the reverse? serves to ensure the influence of some Berlin “the influ-||| and Parisian big banks over the St.
Petersburg ence” of the ||| banks (and their Russian deposits), while Parisian the country’s productive economic life is | and Berlin banks weakened precisely where it ought to be | | compels?? strengthened” (247).
The national income (the “national budg-||| et agricultural production, i.

“Raising productivity and popular ||| consumption is still the most profitable ||| “Narodnik” ||| business” (265) (author’s italics).
This is how the author criticises Witte’s financial policy: “Then, too, they [Witte] went in for speculation and combinations and shifted the risk on to the Treasury, instead of properly organising things” (275).

Speculation versus organisation!! Narodnik!! idem 281-82 and many more.

“I have already expressed my r e g r e t that Russia is being involved in the ‘money ha-ha! market of the civilised world’” (283).
“Every country passing over to a money economy must reckon with the power of the Jewish international organisation,” but (he intimates) the Jews are useful when they are subjected to the interests of the whole, as in Germany, where their talents are kept !! within the bounds of “reason and ethics” (284).

“One can say: Under present circum-stances the dividends of many big banks are well paid out as if they were illegal payment for said! silence”.

(286).
That “my” (Agahd’s) “programme” should be “un-nation-al”?? God forbid!! I am not a cosmopolitan, I am a nation-alist (pp.
87 and 288), I am for the independence of every nation, for good banking, for successful “deals”.

“If such a programme is not ‘national’, | then please explain to me what is really | gem | meant by ‘national’.
Or will I be told that (a nation-| the founding and efficient management alist) | of lastingly profitable businesses does not | come under this concept?” (288).
Author’s italics: for “peace” and a (“United States of Europe”) “Reform of the continental big-banking || || business is therefore in general the first || condition for an economic-political agree-|| ment in Europe, and this is wholly in || accord with the interests of the nations” || (290)and the last phrases in the book: “And my final propositions r e a d as follows: If the European (continental) Great Powers continue unswervingly their hither-to ‘well-tried system’, a world war will compel them to alter it.

.
the difficult period of transition from the slow pace of ordinary work to the high speed which is the leading characteristic of good management” (29).
.
.
.
p.
9: “The main aim of systematic go-slow practices is to keep the shop management ignorant of the potential productivity of machines and workers.
“This go-slow technique is so universal that hardly a com-petent workman can be found in a large establishment with conventional wage systems who does not devote a consider-able part of his time to studying just how slowly he can work and still convince his employer that he is going at a good pace” (9).
.
.
.
“Since 1883, the author has been introducing his !! method in the most diverse United States industries, and has never had to face strikes.
He believes that, under his system, strikes are inevitable only if the majority of the workers belong to a union whose rules are so inflexible that members are allowed to work only on terms laid down by the union” (25).
.
.
.
Another example (p.
33 et seq.
).
Girls tested polished steel balls by hand, rejecting them as spoilage if roughnesses, etc.
, were found.
Observation, control and “time studies” were introduced and the best workers chosen, etc.
, etc.
“It turned out that the girls spent a considerable part of their time talking, or actually doing nothing.
The most negligent girls were set apart or, if incorrigible, dismissed” (35).

On the contrary.
p.

The best factories have one “non-productive” to six or seven productive workers.
The worst have one “non-productive” to eleven productive.
p.
63.
In the e x c e l l e n t Tabor Manufacturing Co.
(with about 100 workers; makers of instruments and moulding-machines), Wallichs found one office employee to three workers!!! p.
67.
Conditions for “reform” ((time required for it = -4 years!!)) .
.
.
“that a body of workers of exceptionally high productivity should be enlisted, who will work extra hard and receive extra high wages”.
.
.
.
.
.
“that the number of supervisory foremen and officials should be at least doubled” (67).
Written reports at least in the form of printed index cards for e a c h worker!! not to speak of foremen!! .
.
.
“however, quite a long time is still needed before they (the workers) learn to stay steadily at their work and make every minute count.
Many of them, with the best of intentions, will fail in this N.
B.
and find that they have no place in the new organi-sation” (69).
.
.
.
“the opportunity of becoming a foreman or senior worker has become far greater, for under the N.
B.
new conditions an increased number of them are required” (75).
(w i n n i n g o v e r and b u y i n g u p work-ers by t u r n i n g them i n t o foremen) Time and motion studies are very difficult.
A cer-tain engineer (Sandford E.
Thompson) (p.
81), for instance, spent s i x years conducting them in the building trades!!! He took every stop-watch obser-vation himself and worked up and tabulated his data with the help of two assistants! ((Excavation, mason-ry, carpentry, cement work, plastering, and so on and so forth)) KK KK.
.
.
“the tables and descriptive matter for one of ! these trades alone take up about 250 pages”.
.
.
.
Further, by tenths of a second (p.
84) (special watches) —the smallest operations were studied (putting down a spade; taking up a wheel barrow; moving a wheel barrow; placing a wheel barrow; taking up a spade, etc.
, etc.
), and measurement made (cubic metres) of the size of a wheel barrow, idem of a spade, etc.
, etc.
For measurement, the best (91) workers are to be chosen and paid a higher pay ( promising an increase of pay).
.
.
.
Yet another example: overhauling and cleaning of boilers.
The author told his assistant to study this.
The latter was a novice and did nothing.
The author personally carried out the work, making a careful time study.
It turned out that a great part of the time was lost owing to the “con-strained position” of the workman (99).
“Protective pads” were made “to fasten to the elbows, knees and hips, and special tools and appliances were made for the various work operations,” etc.
, etc.
(100).
“The whole scheme [many pages: how to per-form the work] was much laughed at when it first went into use”.
.
.
.
The result: cost of over-hauling and cleaning of a set of boilers of 300 h.
p.
250 and 44 fell from 250 marks to 44 marks!!! In the ten years the author worked at the Midvale Steel Works there were no strikes.
The best workers did not join the unions, for they received the best (highest) pay.
“The firm followed the policy of raising the wages of each employee on a suitable occasion and promoting all who deserved it.
A careful record was kept of each man’s good points as well as his shortcomings, which was especially the duty of the foremen, so that justice could be done to each.
When men throughout an estab-lishment are paid according to their individual worth, it cannot he in the interest of those receiving high pay to join a union with the cheap men” (101).
There is a lot of talk about the unity of interests of the working class and the employers, etc.
The author is for fines as the best disciplinary measure.
.
.
.
Fines for the benefit of the accident insurance fund ((from five pfennigs to 250 marks—the size of the fines both against officials and against oneself!!)).

The author spent eight months studying the Tabor Manu-facturing Co.

p.
6: “Those well acquainted with German and American conditions will at once concede that, as regards economic use of material, German industry is far in advance of American, but,on the other hand, as regards economic use of charac-human labour-power, Germany has still much teristic! to learn from the U.

30: “On the average” the Taylor reform takes “ f i v e y e a r s ”.
The Tabor Manufac-turing Co.
was “in danger of b a n k r u p t c y ” !! because of the expense of introducing the Taylor system.
The Tabor Manufacturing Co.
was founded in the 1890s.
In 1904 there was a strike (half-won).
Things were going badly.
Taylor offered to provide money if he were allowed to reorganise (32).
Accepted.

.
.
office workers call it the “talmud” (p.
35).
.
.
.
One employee is engaged solely in studying productivity (time studies), which enables him to study deeply all hand movements and operations, and to i m p r o v e them.

man prefers to address one not so educated in a tone of command, and the same thing applies between the engineer and the foreman, and between the foreman and the worker.
Under the Taylor system, where they must feel themselves co-workers, such a tone will no longer be permissible” (152).

It will take years to become accustomed to “workers being promoted to the posts of foremen and officials”.

96 et seq.
) .
.
.
“The motions of every individual, no matter what his work may be, have been studied and standardised.
.
.
.
.
.
.
“In laying bricks, the motions used in laying a single brick were reduced from 18 to 5, with an increase in output from 120 bricks an hour to 350 an hour.
In folding cotton cloth, 20 to 30 motions were reduced to 10 or 12, with the result that instead of 150 dozen pieces of cloth, 400 dozen were folded, ? with no added fatigue.
The motions of a girl putting paper on boxes of shoe polish were studied.
Hermethods were-changed only slightly, and where she had been doing 24 boxes in 40 seconds, she did 24 in 20 seconds, with less effort.
Similar studies have cut down the motions not only of men and women in other trades but also of surgeons, of nurses, of office workers; in fact, of workers in every type of work studied”.
.
.
(96-97).
Assembly of braiding machines .
.
.
“where eighteen braid-ers had been assembled by one man in a day, it now becomes possible to assemble 66 braiders per man per day, with no increase in fatigue” (97).
.
.
.
The latest method 1) micro-motion studies .
.
.
2) use of the “chronocyclograph” (97).
.
.
.
I.
The “micro-motion clock” is placed in front of the worker and it registers “different times of day in each pic-ture of a motion picture film” (98).
.
.
.
II.
“The chronocyclograph method of making motion study consists of fastening tiny electric light bulbs to the fingers of the operator, or to any part of the operator or of the material whose motion path it is desired to study”.
.
.
(the movement of the light, its track, is photo-graphed) (98).
These studies are in the interest of society as a whole.
.
.
.
“One typical result is the gradual filling in of the gap between the school and the plant.
An intensive study of motions is proving that there ||| !! are far greater likenesses in trades, and even pro-||| N.
B.
fessions, on the mechanical side, than we have ever || believed possible.
The demand of the industrial world will be more and more for young workers trained to be fingerwise” (101).
.
.
.
This must be taught in the schools.
.
.
.
“fingerwise, that is, training his muscles so that they respond easily and quickly to demands for skilled work”.
.
.
.
At present an “enormous waste” (102) is occurring from scattered, duplicated, etc.
, “investigations”.
.
.
.
“It is the work of the United States Government to establish such a bureau of standardisation of mechanical trades.
The standards there derived and collected would be public property, and original investigators could invent from these standards upwards” (103).

Every crisis (1857, 1873, 1900) leads to concentration, but especially 1900: “Side by side with the gigantic plants in the basic industries, the crisis of 1900 still found many plants organised on lines that today would be considered obsolete, the ‘pure’ [non-combined] plants, which were brought into being at the height of the industrial boom.
The fall in prices and the falling off in demand put these ‘pure’ enterprises in a precarious positions which did not affect the gigantic com-bined enterprises at all or did so only for a very short time.
As a consequence the crisis of 1900 || N.
B.
resulted in a far greater concentration of indus-|| try than the crisis of 1873; the latter crisis || also produced a sort of selection of the best-|| equipped enterprises, but owing to the level of technical development at that time, this selection could not place the firms which success-fully emerged from the crisis in a position of monopoly.
Such a durable monopoly exists to a high degree in the gigantic enterprises in the modern iron and steel and electrical industries owing to their very complicated monop-technique, far-reaching organisation and magni-oly tude of capital, and, to a lesser degree, in the engineering industry, certain branches of the metallurgical industry, transport, etc.
” (108).

111: When it was found necessary to make the firm Phoenix join the Stahlwerksverband, the Schaaffhausenscher Bankverein bought up the majority of its shares and ensured the adoption of the required decision.
In the same way, the Dresdner Bank “won” two places on the Supervisory Board of the Königs-und Laurahütte iron and steel mills (four years ago) and carried through what it wanted.

The role of the Supervisory Boards is very wide (in fact it could be = management).

“But the cases quoted [a number of “ n a m e s ” are cited: Dernburg—director of the Darmstädter Bank, Gwinner—director of the Deutsche Bank] clearly show that Industrial leaders are mainly on the Supervisory Board of companies of the same branch or the same region, whereas directors of the big banks, on the other hand, are on the boards of the most diverse enterprises”.

“Simultaneously with this widen-ing of the sphere of activity of certain big industrialists and with the assignment of provincial bank managers to definite || industrial regions, there is a growth of || specialisation among the directors of the || big banks.
Generally speaking, this spe-cialisation is only conceivable when bank-ing is conducted on a large scale, and particularly when it has widespread con-nections with industry.
This division of labour proceeds along two lines: on the ||| one hand, relations with industry as a ||| whole are entrusted to one director, as his ||| special function; on the other, each director assumes the supervision of separate “supervision” enterprises, or of a group of enterprises of social in the same branch of industry or having economy similar interests.
One specialises in German industry, sometimes even in West German industry alone, others specialise in rela-||| tions with foreign states and foreign indus-||| try, in information on the characters of industrialists, and others, in Stock Exchange questions, etc.
Besides, each bank director often assigned a special locality or a special branch of industry; one works ||| chiefly on Supervisory Boards of electric ||| companies; another, on chemical, brewing, N.
B.
||| or beet sugar plants, a third, in a few iso-lated industrial enterprises, but at the same time works on the Supervisory Boards of non-industrial companies, such as insur-ance companies.
To demonstrate this from the example of some Berlin bank directors would take us too far into the personal sphere.
In short, there can be no doubt that the growth in the dimensions and diversity of the big banks’ operations is accompanied by an ever greater division of labour among their directors with the object (and result) of, so to speak, lifting them somewhat out of pure banking and making them better experts, better judges of the general problems of industry and ||| the special problems of each branch of ||| industry, thus making them more capable ||| of acting within the respective bank’s indus-trial sphere of influence.
This system is supplemented by the banks’ endeavours to elect to their Supervisory Boards or those of subordinate banks, men who are experts in industrial affairs, such as industrialists, former officials, especially those with expe-rience in the railway service or in mining, * from whom they want not so much con-nections with industrial enterprises as expert advice—advice, based less on academic education than on many years of techni-cal, business and human experience”.

“But as member of a Supervisory Board, a bank director has not only the advantage of being interested in conscien-tious performance of his office because of his responsibility to the bank; he also || is the best informed as to the state of the || market and can make his large office staff || carry out the commercial and technical || * See present edition, Vol .

“An examination of the sum total of industrial relationships reveals the uni-“universal versal character of the financial establish-character” ments working on behalf of industry.
Unlike other kinds of banks, and contrary “unlike” to the demand sometimes expressed in (the old) the literature that banks should specialise in one kind of business or in one branch of industry in order to prevent the ground from slipping from under their feet—the big banks are striving to make their con-nections with industrial enterprises as varied as possible in respect of the locality ||| or branches of industry and are striving ||| to eliminate the unevenness in the distri-||| bution of capital among localities and ||| branches of industry resulting from the ||| historical development of individual enter-||| prises*.
Hand in hand with this is the ||| effort to base relations with industry on regular, lasting business connections, to give expression to them and to afford them the possibility of becoming wider and deeper by means of a ramified system of seats on Supervisory Boards.
Compared with these two spheres of influence, the issue of stock is of relatively less impor-tance for the big banks’ relations with * Ibid .

One tendency is to make the |||| |||| connections with industry general; another |||| tendency is to make them durable and |||| |||| close.
In the six big banks both these tendencies are realised, not in full, but to a considerable extent and to an equal degree” (180).
.

* “The connections between the banks and industrial enterprises, with their new content, their new forms and their new organs, namely, the big banks which are organised on both a centralised and a de-centralised basis, were scarcely a charac-teristic economic phenomenon before the nineties; in one sense, indeed, this initial date may be advanced to the year 1897, when the important mergers took place, and when, for the first time, the new form of decentralised organisation was intro-duced to suit the industrial policy of the banks.
This starting-point could perhaps be placed at an even later date, for it was the crisis of 1900 that enormously accele-rated and intensified the process of con-centration of industry and of banking, consolidated that process, for the first time transformed the connection with industry into an actual monopoly of the big banks, and made this connection much closer and more active” (181) ** .
.
.
.
.
.
.
“The sudden concentration in the Rhine-Westphalian mining industry, the for-mation of the Federation of Steel Plants, the mergers of the big electric companies, etc.
, have undoubtedly greatly accelerated practical solution of the question of the connections between the banks and indus-try” (182).

“Modern industry has led the banks into entirely new fields of economic life .
.
.
the bank is to a certain extent passing from its role, in the main, of intermediary into the sphere of industrial production.
.
.
.
In this way [through the connection with industry] the big banks are in touch not only with development trends in individual |||| |||| plants, but also with the interrelationship |||| between the different plants of a given |||| |||| industry and between different industries” |||| (183).
.
.

“Anyone who has watched, in recent years, the changes of incumbents of direc-torships and seats on the Supervisory Boards of the big banks, cannot fail to have noticed that power is gradually passing into the hands of men who consider the active intervention of the big banks in the general development of industry to be necessary and of increasing impor-tance.
Between these new men and the old bank directors, disagreement on this subject of a business and often of a per-sonal nature is growing.
The issue is wheth-er or not the banks, as credit institu-tions, will suffer from this intervention in the industrial production process, and whether they are sacrificing tried prin-ciples and assured profit to engage in a field of activity which has nothing in common with their role of middlemen in providing credit and which is leading the banks into a field where they are more than ever before exposed to the blind forces of trade fluctuations.
This is the opinion of many of the older bank direc-tors, while most of the young men consid-er active intervention in industry to be a necessity as great as that which gave rise, simultaneously with big modern indus-N.

“In the dealings of the German big banks with foreign industrial enterprises, we should distinguish two stages, differing in basis and in time.
The first, taken histor-ically, coincides approximately with the flourishing period of foreign loans and relates, therefore, to different years in different countries: the seventies and eigh-ties can be regarded as the heyday of foreign railway construction” (187).
Two subtypes (“opposite poles”): the Rumanian railways and participation in American railways.
“This first stage is marked by partici-pation in foreign industry being closely bound up with loan activity, although German home industry, as a supplier, can derive some benefit from this.
The powerful initiative of the banks is deci-sive, but it only indirectly concerns indus-try, their main attention being devoted to profitable investments in foreign secu-rities.
It requires a situation in which home industry is not yet so concentrated and, at the same time, so expanding as it || | | || | | has become since the nineties.
In the second stage, on the contrary, || foreign loans are of less importance, while || the interest of the big banks in foreign || industry increases, for this is less depend-|| ent on other financial connections with || the country concerned.
The big banks more || frequently sponsor, or co-sponsor, indus-trial companies in other countries and, at the same time, collaborate closely with German home industry in foreign business operations” (188).
.
.
.

.
.
“In foreign expansion these [German concerns] are much more dependent on two stages railways since the nineties second stage4 forms my italics establish “its own” industry division of the world the banks than in their domestic opera-tions.
.
.
.
The bank operating abroad [in contrast to domestic operations], however, feels itself at home, has its branches, con-trols international payments, and might even be connected with the government of the given country by helping it float a loan” (189).
.
.
.
“Four forms of bank participation in foreign industrial enterprises can be dis-tinguished: 1.
The formation of branches or subsidiary enterprises for Ger-man home industry.

.

.
.
.
“2.
The formation .

of separate foreign enterprises which are only loosely or not at all connected with home industry.

in Baku; 9(3) the Austrian oilfields; 9(4) the Rumanian oilfields; 9(5) overseas oilfields, particularly in the D u t c h colonies (the extremely rich Samuel , and S h e l l Transport and Trading Co.

“A similar role [aid to industrial enter-prises] is played by the banks in estab-| lishing societies for technical research, | the results of which are intended to benefit | friendly industrial enterprises.

Complaints are heard of the “terrorism” of the banks—(219-20)—t h e y m a k e i t c o m p u l s o r y (for orders and so on) to deal with a particular firm (220).
In the electrical industry a special role was played by the crisis (apparently 1900), and the banks intensified and accelerated the ruin of the relatively small enterprises and their absorption by the big ones (pp.
230-32).
.

“The banks refused a helping hand to the very firms in greatest need of capital, and brought on first a frenziedboom and then the hopeless failure of the companies which were not connected with them closely enough” (232).

In a § on the relation of the big banks to the cartels (253-58), the author has somewhat “spread himself” and become incoherent.
He distinguishes four forms: (1) indifference (to unimportant cartels); () “definite interest” (254) in cartels such as that of the coal industry (in cartels which are life-and-death questions for the industry); (3) “help” for a cartel, e.

The oil trust could be fought only by an electricity monop-oly, by converting water-power into cheap electricity.
But we shall get an electricity monopoly only when this becomes profitable to the producers.

Water-power will then have to be used.
But it will be impossible to con-vert it into cheap electricity at state expense; it will also have to be handed !! over to a ‘private monopoly controlled by the state’, because private industry has already concluded a number of contracts “tribute” to and has stipulated for heavy compensation finance for its expensive steam-power plants, which * See pp .

By refraining from disposing of their money themselves, the depositors “strengthen the power of big capital and weaken the strength of resistance of small-scale industry” (8).

Typical of a petty-bourgeois reformist.
Two examples: “Some years ago, owing to the rigid attitude of the Rhine-Westphalian Coal Syndicate, a strong anti-cartel movement swept through Germany.
The Reich govern-ment appointed an Enquiry Committee to study the problem of cartels.
In the course of its proceedings, Government Coun-| sellor Völker distinguished himself by his | good brilliant mastery of the subject and his | example! sharp business-like speeches against the | (finance cartel representatives.
Shortly thereafter, | capital Counsellor Völker accepted a highly paid | and the post as leader of the German Steel Asso-| 18 government) ciation, Germany’s most powerful and | closely-knit cartel organisation.
With the |!! government thus deprived of its best expert, the enquiry petered out” (827-28).
There is no need, he remarks, to point to America! There is an Imperial Private Insurance Supervisory Office, which has done much to control private insurance companies.
And then the insurance companies come along and entice the “controllers” with offers of lucrative posts (including director-ships).
“In recent years, no less than three control officials have made the leap from the Imperial Supervisory Office to a direc-torship in an insurance company” (831).

A note: “German Concessions Abroad.
” The Chamber of Commerce in Barmen writes in a Memo-randum to the Minister of Trade: “A considerable amount of German capi-tal is invested in the Transvaal gold mines, despite which, unfortunately, sup-plies from German engineering factories for the Transvaal mines are only very | small, because the technical management | of the mines is predominantly in English | hands.
From this point of view, it would | be extremely regrettable if the Mannes-| mann concessions (in Morocco) were to be good example | absorbed in the French mining syndicate.
of the role, | If that were to happen the technical man-significance | agement of the Moroccan mines would quite and policy of | certainly fall wholly into French hands, | and there would be no prospect of supplying finance | German machinery and equipment.
It would capital | be an irreparable mistake if German capi-| tal, while sharing in Moroccan mining | enterprises, were to leave the technical | management in French hands, just as it | has been left in English hands in the Transvaal.
The German engineering indus-try would not benefit from such an exploi-tation of the Mannesmann mines, and German capital participation would only benefit the French engineering industry.
On the other hand, German industry would benefit immensely if even only a compar-atively small part of the Moroccan mines were under German technical management”.

had already in previous years made ad-|| vances on this loan.

Only in very recent years || have they regained the level of 1891, || thanks to two new loans.
|| “German exports to Portugal rose, follow-|| ing the loans of 1888-89, to 21,100,000 || (1890); then, in the two following years, || they dropped to 16,200,000 and 7,400,000 || and regained their former level only in || 1903.

1890-91 ? ? 1888-89 1888 1890 ? 1889 1906Strange that the author should not see how these facts refute him: the rise in exports occurs precisely a f t e r the loans and i n c o n s e q u e n c e (infolge) of them.
Lansburgh’s petty-bourgeois standpoint: “And German industry would profit [if the exported capital remained at home] not only in amount but in distribution.
Capital would be distributed freely over many branches of industry, would flow ||| along numerous channels, whereas from !! ||| abroad, as experience has shown, it flows into the order books of a few privileged firms which, in addition, have to pay dearly | for their privileges.
Krupp could tell gem!! | us a thing or two about how many millions he has “persuaded” | in expenses, known as baksheesh or by | some other name, have to be paid to support Krupp!!! || German credit activity abroad.

A short review of L e v y ’s Monopolies and Trusts and L i e f m a n n ’s Financial and Industrial Companies.
L a n s-Levy b u r g h says, rightly, that both are one-versus sided: Levy’s accent is on the technical Liefmann strength of concentration, Liefmann’s on the strength of financial (oligarchic) oppres-sion.
“The growing role of stocks and securities (“Effektifizierung”) in industry vastly in-creases the scale of production, reduces the number of independent producers and makes it easier for the few—if they are not prepared to be bought up by some giant trust—to unite in order to suppress all newly-arising competition.
Though that | | point is made neither by Liefmann nor |||| | | Levy, it clearly emerges from both books.
|||| | | This might, perhaps, prompt someone to |||| write a book that is urgently needed: a book that describes how a security-manipulating oligarchy has wrested con-trol of the republic’s economic life” (1051-52).
Sometimes the development is through concentration to cartels (Levy has shown this particularly clearly).
But n o t always.
“Substitution of securities” can lead at one stroke to a trust, e.
g.
, “in colonial railway construction”.
.
.
.
Technical concentration is progressive as regards technique; financial concentration can strengthen, and does strength-en, the omnipotence of monopoly capital alongside back-ward technique.
.
.
.
REMARKS ((ON FINANCE CAPITAL IN GENERAL)) Export to colonies (and financially depend-ent countries) versus export to independent countries: Let us assume that the latter is greater and increases at a faster rate than the former.
Does this prove the “non-necessity” of colonies and networks of f i n a n c i a l dependence?(K.
Kautsky.
) No, for (1) even in relation to independent countries (taking all exports) the share of cartels, trusts, dumping, in-creases.
.
.
.
(2) Finance capital does not abolish the lower (less developed, backward) forms of cap-italism, but grows out of them, above them.
.
.
.
|| (3) There is a definite ratio between N.
B.
|| “normal” and monopoly sales, ergo between on || “normal” and monopoly exports.
Capitalists finance || cannot help selling staple commodities to capital || millions of workers.
Does this mean that and its || it is “unnecessary” for them to acquire signifi-|| extra-profit through government, railway || cance || “contracts”, etc.
? (4) The extra-profit from privileged and monopoly sales compensates for the low profit of “normal” sales.
(5) Compare with the banks: extra-profit as intermediaries in floating loans, promoting bubble companies, etc.
, compensates for low profit (sometimes no profit) on “normal” credit operations.
(6) The high technique of concentrated industry and the “high technique” of financial swindling, and the “high technique” (in reali-ty, low technique) of oppression by finance capital—they are inseparably linked under capitalism.
K.
Kautsky wants to destroy the link, “whitewash” capitalism, take the good and throw away the bad: “modern Proudhon-ism”, petty-bourgeois reformism “under the mask of Marxism”.
Σ Σ = finance capital (monopolies, banks, oligarchy, buying up, etc.
) is not an accidental excrescence on capitalism, but its ineradicable continuation and product.

“On the basis of my investigations up | now, I have no doubt that the trust | embodies the advantages, but to a still | character-istic! greater extent the disadvantages, of capi-| (rather talist large-scale industry, in the sense | of an unceasing and reckless urge to go | cowardly!) forward, whereas the policy of the cartel | * See present edition, Vol .

If the world market were dominated by great national trusts, it would expe-rience far-reaching struggles over prices and sales, carried to the sharpest ex-tremes.
.
.
.
In this connection, the cartels can and should be as much concerned for tech-nical and economic progress as free compe-tition is; perhaps they will not accelerate it so precipitately as the trusts” (128).

Now competition has been done away with.
There remain two or three dozen big plants.
At the head are Thyssen, Lueg and Kirdorf (261).
“Two gigantic associations”: the coal syndicate and the steel syndicate ((87.
5 per cent of stee output)) “must rule over the whole”.

The land has been bought up (coal and ore).
“The head of the concern controls the || principal company [literally: the “mother || company”]; the latter reigns over the subsid-|| iary companies [“daughter companies”], which || in their turn control still other subsidiaries || [“grandchild companies”], etc.
In this way, || better it is possible with a comparatively small || than in || capital to dominate immense spheres of || Liefmann production.
Indeed, if holding 50 per cent || and of the capital is always sufficient to control || earlier a company, the head of the concern needs || only one million to control eight million || in the second subsidiaries.

These giant enterprises, | producing 400,000 tons of steel per annum, | with a tremendous output of ore and coal | and producing finished steel goods, employing | 10,000 workers quartered in company houses | and sometimes owning their own railways | and ports, are the typical representatives | of the German iron and steel industry.

“The deputy Erzberger told the Reichstag (April 24, | 1912): ‘If the Minister of War were to satisfy all the || requests for garrisons addressed to the War Department, | he would have to ask for military appropriations six | times as large’” (p.
18).
The petty bourgeoisie gains in all sorts of ways from garrisons.
One of the reasons why militarism is popular! Source References: Wilhelm Ahr, The Armed Services and the National Economy of the Great Powers During the Last Thirty Years, Berlin, 1909.

It means not the rounding off of territory, || ? but the conquest and occupation of the big cross-|| roads of world trade; it means acquiring advantageous-ly located rather than big colonies, so as to cover the globe with a dense and continuous network of sta-tions, coal depots and cables.

“Thus, the conquest of markets, the drive for tropical produce—such is the prime cause of the policy of colonial expansion which has come to be known as imperialism.

P A couple of examples which, possibly, might be useful: Some of the arguments against imperialism: “The same statistics prove further that the occupation of a territory by His Majesty’s troops often benefits only foreigners and very little British subjects; in Egypt only German and Belgian trade has increased since 1881: British imports to Egypt amounted to £8,726,000 in 1870; £3,060,000 in 1880; £3,192,000 in 1892; £4,435,000 in 1897, whereas German imports rose from £E21,000 (Egyp-tian £= 25.
60 francs) in 1886 to £E281,000 in 1896, and Belgian imports rose from £86,000 to £458,000 in the same period” (p.
249).
“Having invented the extraction of sugar from beet, France became the world’s leading sugar producer: she still had a monopoly in 1870, when Germany entered the field.
A study of the French crops showed that, like Northern France, she had a favourable soil and climate in areas near her coal mines.
But her soil was less fertile and her climate more severe.
The fight against the French would have to be waged on unequal terms.
Nevertheless, by 1882, French sugar manufacturers were already complaining: German sugar is penetrating the French market.
.
.
.
German beet has a 12 per cent sugar content; French growers say they cannot obtain more than 7 per cent”—the Germans had improved cultivation methods, fertilisers, selection, etc.
, etc.
“In less than twelve years of German competition, France, which invented beet sugar, was deprived of the profit from her invention.
Her sugar law of 1884 was dictated by German science, Germany being henceforth the empress of sugar, and, in addition, of alcohol” (pp.
311-12).

RUSSIER, THE PARTITION OF OCEANIA Henri Russier, The Partition of Oceania, Paris, 1905.
(Thesis.
) A very detailed s u m m a r y of a mass of material.
Unfortunately, there are no exact statistical totals (à la Supan).
Well compiled.
Many source references, maps, photographs.
Author divides the history of the “political parti-tion” into periods: 1) discovery (16th-18th centuries) 2) missions (1797-1840) 3) “first conflicts” (1840-70) N.
B.
4) “international competition”, 1870-1904.

Q This is followed by detailed economic, commercial and geographical information about each of the colonies.
To the economic causes of colonial policy the author adds (N.
B.
)—social causes:“To these [enumerated above and well-known] economic causes must be added social causes.
— Owing to the growing complexities of life, which weigh heavily not only on the masses of the work-ers, but also on the middle classes, one sees accumulating in all countries of old civilisation ‘impatience, rancour and hatred that are a menace to public order, declassed energies and turbulent gem!! forces, which must be taken in hand and given employment abroad in order to avert an explosion at home’ ” * (Wahl, France in Her Colonies, Paris, p.
92)—(pp.
165-66).

T h e R a i l C a r t e l: “During the very severe depression of 1884, British, Belgian and German rail firms agreed on a division of export business, on the understanding that there would be no competition in their home markets.
At first Great Britain was allotted 66 per cent, Belgium 7 per cent and Germany 27 per cent of the exports; later the figures were somewhat modified in favour of the continental countries.
India was reserved entirely for Great Britain.
.
.
.
The British firms divided their share among themselves and fixed a price which enabled plants working under unfavourable conditions to continue in operation.
.
.
.
Joint war was declared against a British firm remaining outside the cartel, the cost of which was met by a levy of two shillings on all sales.
But when two British firms retired from the cartel, it collapsed”.
.
.
.
* (quoted from the edition of 1886).

“Twenty years elapsed before a new international association was formed.
In spite of all efforts, it was impossible, during these decades of rapid industrial development on the continent and in America, to reach agreement on territorial limits and quotas.
.
.
.
“In 1904 an agreement was at last reached with Germany, Belgium and France on the basis of 53.
50 per cent, 28.

99-100).
As regards the United States Steel Corporation, it is still an open question whether Charles Schwab is right in main-taining that the iron ore mines of Lake Superior (mostly bought up by the Steel Corporation) will soon be the only ones left—or whether Carnegie is right in thinking that many ore deposits will still be found in America.

state of peace is merely a truce, which many find too long and which many do not observe.
The world is seized by a strange fever of imperialism, by fierce cupidities arising on all sides and shamelessly allowed to take effect.
Society is shaken by the struggle of classes, everywhere violently conducted and hardly mitigated in recent times.
Even the human mind is upset by doubts and the need for certainty.
“Mankind is in the throes of revolution— a territorial revolution, a new delimitation of frontiers, an assault on the great markets of the world, armaments up to the hilt, as if people were going to hurl themselves at one another tomorrow, for mutual ruin and extermination—a social revolution based on the worst feelings, the hatred of the |||| |||| cf.

—A profound revolution, the outcome of that of the preceding cen-tury, but much more severe because of its incalculable consequences: for at issue is not only the political organisation of states, but the material and moral condi-tion of mankind” (393-94).

“Militarisation of the nation”, “an armed people”, what a misfortune!—one hears this more and more frequently.
But we say: militarisation of the nation, an armed people, drawing children and, if you like, women, into military training—so much the better, the speedier will the war be turned into a civil war, into an uprising.

Paul Louis, Outline of Imperialism, p.
100 et seq.
“Imperialism is a general phenomenon of our age; more, a characteristic feature of the early twentieth cen-tury, and few nations have been able to avoid its influence.
“The world is passing through the era of imperialism, just as it has experienced the crises of liberalism, protec-tionism, colonialism,—just as it has experienced the collective effort of nationalities, just as in the last ten years it has witnessed the universal spread and increasing growth of socialism.
All these elements, all these aspects of the life of mankind, are closely linked, and imperialism and socialism to a very large extent form the fundamental contradiction of our age.
To show up this contradiction amounts practically to defining the essential principles of both” (100).
.
.
.
“Imperialism is equally triumphant in Britain and the U.
S.
A.
, in Japan and the Russian Empire, in Germany, France and Italy” (100-01).
.
.
.
“It [imperialism] emerges everywhere as capitalism’s supreme effort to preserve its wealth, political domination, social authority.
This involves territorial conquest, forcible or peaceful extension of possessions, closure of markets, creation of a closed empire” (101).
The wars of 1820-48 were bound up “with the formation of the great German and Italian nationalities” (102).
.
.
.
.
.
.
“Imperialism combines colonialism and protectionism” (105).
.
.
.
“It [imperialism] should above all be studied in Great Britain, for there it has found its Promised Land” (106).
.
.
.
But alongside Great Britain there has developed (1) the competition of France, Germany, America and Japan; (2) the struggle for colonial markets (of Europe and the colonial countries themselves); (3) the merchant fleet of other countries.
“Imperialism arose from these three established facts” (107).
(Chamberlain’s campaign.
Imperial federation, etc.
).
The same applies to the United states—Russia—Germa-ny—Japan (109).
(Hence—the aggravation of nationalism, etc.
) “Nationalism, which merges with imperialism” .
.
.
carries the threat of war, etc.
(112).
But these wars “will deal irreparable blows to the social institutions of participating countries” (113).
It will lead to the formation of gigantic empires—to growing discontent among the workers (113), the “mob” .
.
.
(113) (rising living costs, etc.
, etc.
).
“The capitalist world regards imperialism, its last card, as the last refuge against the bankruptcy and spontaneous disintegration that threatens to engulf it with fatal cer-tainty.
But imperialism is also a remarkable, incompar-able, artisan of revolution” (114).

66 million square kilo-metres = 66% of the world.
South America = 18.

.

“The world is now almost completely ‘divi-ded up’.
But world history teaches us that empires well tend to divide up each other after they have more said! or less divided among themselves the ‘no-master’ areas in all parts of the globe” (37).
(a detailed paraphrase of Seeley.
.
.
.
) Present-day British and French imperialism—like that of Spain, Holland, Portugal, France and Great Britain in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries—is “West-European imperialism based on overseas colonisation” (43).
Russia is different.
Russia is more an Asiatic country.
It is in the interest of all Europe to seal itself off from Asia.
The Great Russians= a mixture with Asiatics; the frontier of Europe= the frontier of the Great Russians (p.
50).
Germanophile!! The alliance of France and Great Britain with Russia is an alliance against “the general vital interests of all Europe” (51).
Incidentally: p.
46, remarks that Swed -“Swedish” en is “a former Great Power, dethroned imperialism by Russia herself”.
favours Nothing could be more legitimate than German the foundation (1871) of the German imperialism Empire.
Great Britain, France and Rus-sia consider it their “right” to dismember and enfeeble Germany!! (56).
“Imperialism is a universal [sic!] political stage of development, through which every [!!] great people with large internal forces and a momentous mis-sion must pass” (56-57).
Percentage and per capita expenditure on the army and navy is less in Germany than in France and Great Britain (58).
The “legend” (59) of Germany’s excessive “militarisa-tion”! “This cause [of the 1914-15 world catastrophe], it seems to me, lies in the relative weakness rather than the relative strength of Germany” (60).
.
.
.
From the standpoint of Russia & Great Britain & France, a “pre-ventive war” w a s necessary ”.
.
.
.
“True, modern economic imperialism and imperialist expansion are possible to a certain extent even without the direct acquisition of territories in other parts of the world, which we call ‘colonisation’.
Capital, traders and entre-preneurs are dispatched, railways and canals are constructed, huge regions in all parts of the world are made accessible to modern capitalist development, and in this way, spheres of economic influence, or spheres of domination, in other parts of the world are acquired without direct seizure of territory or political conquest.
“Undoubtedly, German imperialism has hitherto, employed, to a considerable extent, these more peaceful aha! methods of expansion.
This could be, but might not be, merely preparation for colonial acquisitions in the previous sense” (62).
It has been aimed chiefly at Asia Minor and Mesopota-mia—areas not belonging to the British Empire.
Great Britain seeks to deprive Germany of just that development which she herself extensively enjoys & France & Russia (62-63).
“The world war of 1914-15 is therefore really a world war—a war to give the new German Empire a share in ruling the world, a war in which the leading role is played by the mistress of the world, Great Britain, while the two next most powerful world powers—Russia and France— are interested participants” (63).
imperialism = a law of history! Great Britain & France & Russia = 46% of the earth and 43% of its population; & the U.

((A note to the article says it was written before the war, for the Congress, and has been slightly altered.
)) | It is not uncommon now to “identify with | imperialism all the phenomena of present-day | capitalism—cartels, protection, the domination | of the financiers, and colonial policy” (908).
| In that case we have “the flattest tautology”, | in that case “imperialism is naturally a vital | necessity for capitalism” ** (908).
? The term, he says, must be taken “not in this generalised sense, but in its historical determi-nation” (909), as in Britain, i.
e.
, “as a special || kind of political strivings”.
“The British under-|| stand” (909) by imperialism the striving, on the ? Hobson! || one hand, to unite all parts of the empire with || the metropolis, and, on the other, to extend the || empire.
.

“Imperialism is a product of highly developed industrial capitalism.
It consists in the striving * See present edition, Vol .

—Ed .
every industrial capitalist nation to bring | under its control or to annex ever bigger areas | no good at all of agrarian [Kautsky’s italics] territory, irre-| spective of what nations inhabit them” * (909).
.
.
.
Further, he discusses the “production proportion” (heading of §1) between agriculture and industry, between means of production and means of consumption.
§2: “Simple commodity production” (blather, old stuff).
§3: “Capitalist production”: capitalist industry requires that “the agricultural area serving it as supplier and pur-chaser” should “constantly expand” ((slipshod!)).
§4: “Accumulation and imperialism.
” The contradiction between industry and agriculture finds dual expression (917): (1) over-production (in industry).
.
.
.
(2) high costs (of raw materials and staple products).
.
.
.
Imperialism was preceded by the “form” (striving for expansion) of free trade: “half-a-century ago it, too, was considered the last word in capitalism, as imperialism is today” (917).
.
.
.
Free trade helped develop other countries (the United States & Europe); their protectionist policy: in place of the division of labour between British industry and the agriculture of all other countries, “they” (the other countries) “divided up the still free agrarian regions of the world among the big N.
B.
industrial countries, because these regions were |||| |||| incapable of resistance.
Britain reacted to this.
|||| That was the beginning of imperialism.
“It was especially assisted by the system, which || ? arose simultaneously with it, of export of capital || || to the agrarian regions” (918).
.
.
.
Railways in the new countries—the development of trade—their protection by the state—the striving for annexations (& preventing the development of industry in them).
.
.
.
“These are the most important roots of imperialism which replaced free trade”.
.
.
.
* Ibid .
, p .
268 .
—Ed .
“Does it constitute the last possible form of capitalist world policy, or is some other form still possible?” One “aspect of imperialism”, that is “a vital necessity for capitalism”, viz.
: domination over and subjugation of agricultural regions, the construction of railways, can be overcome “ only through socialism” (920).
.
.
.
There is, however, another aspect of imperialism: the struggle waged by states, armaments, war, the resistance of India, Islam and Eastern Asia, the resistance of the proletariat—all this impels “the capitalists of all countries to unite” (920).
.
.
.
“From the purely economic point of view, ultra-|| impe-|| therefore, it is not impossible that capitalism rialism * || will yet go through a new phase, that of the ||| e x t e n s i o n o f t h e p o l i c y o f t h e ha-ha ||| c a r t e l s t o f o r e i g n p o l i c y , t h e ||| p h a s e of u l t r a -i m p e r i a l i s m, against which, of course, we would have to fight as vigorously as against imperialism, although it will bring dangers in another direction, not in that of an armaments race and threats to world peace” (921).
.
.
.
This was written before the war.
Austria’s ||| conflict with Serbia “did not arise exclusively !! ||| from imperialist tendencies” (922)—it has ||| “just as much (ebenso) a nationalist” “as an ||| imperialist root” (922).
True, he says, there ha-ha! ||| are “contradictions”, which imperialism creat-||| ed “between the other Great Powers”.
Arma-ments might be increased and peace (after this war) will be only a truce.
“From the purely economic point of view, nothing any longer prevents this huge discharge of tension from finally resulting in the abolition of imperialism through a holy alliance of the imperialists” (922).

Cunow e q u a t e s imperialism with “modern capi-talism” (109).
Kautsky rejects this.
In Britain in the 1890s (110), impe-rialism meant the striving for a great Britain (110), for empire, “a special kind of imperial policy” (110.

We must draw this distinction: imperialism is not a “phase of economy”, but a special policy, like Manchester-ism.
24 We must distinguish between finance capital and imperialism—“its policy” (111).
“Imperialism is a special kind of capitalist policy, as was also Manchesterism, which it replaced.
The latter, too, did not denote a defi-well, nite ‘phase of economy’, a l t h o u g h i t w a s nec-that’s e s s a r i l y c o n n e c t e d with such a phase” it! (111).

(; ) “In my opinion, the contradiction between principled and reformist tactics is that the latter is t o o s t r o n g l y determined by i m m e -d i a t e i n t e r e s t s , by easily attainable and ? apparent results, and s a c r i f i c e s t o t h e m t h e i n n e r s t r e n g t h o f t h e p r o l e-t a r i a t.
Principled, Marxist tactics aim primarily at increasing the power of the proletariat, thereby securing the highest positive results; for these results, being concessions made by the ruling classes, depend primarily on the power of the proletariat” (p.
111).
And before the above passage: (**) not the right word; not so true! “The essence of the socialist class struggle is inseparable unity of the struggle f o r s o c i a l -i s m ( ** ) and representation of all the immediate interests of the proletariat.
Only the Party’s fight for the current interests of the working class makes it the party of the proletariat, the party of the masses, and enables it to win victory” (8).
N.
B.
Pannekoek’s formulation of the ques-tion of reformism is wrong.
N.
B.
Pannekoek has here posed a question of prime importance, but has answered it badly—or, at least, inaccurately.
“The unity of the struggle for socialism and for reforms” or “and for the immediate interests of the workers”? But what is the struggle for socialism? In Pannekoek’s formula, the distinc-tion between the Left and the “Centre” is blurred, wiped out, has disappeared.
Even Kautsky (who, incidentally, made no rejoinder to this article of Pannekoek’s) would subscribe to Pannekoek’s formula (the one given here).
This formula is wrong.
The s t r u g g l e for s o c i a l i s m lies in || the u n i t y of the struggle for the immediate || interests of the workers (including reforms) and the || revolutionary s t r u g g l e for power, for expro-|| priation of the bourgeoisie, for the overthrow of || || the bourgeois government and the bourgeoisie.
What have to be combined are n o t the struggle for reforms & phrases about socialism, the struggle “for social-ism”, b u t t w o f o r m s of struggle.
For example: 1.
Voting for reforms & revolutionary action by the masses.
.
.
.
2.
Parliamentarism & demonstrations.
.
.
.
3.
The demand for reforms & the (concrete) demand for revolution.

Economic struggle together with the unorganised, with the masses, and not only on behalf of the organised work-ers.

ARGUMENTS OF THE SOCIAL-PATRIOTS Arguments of the Social-Patriots Upton S i n c l a i r ’ s pamphlet, with B l a t c h f o r d ’ s reply, sets out particularly clearly, frankly, accurately and vigorously the new (not Plekhanov’s or Kautsky’s, etc.
) argument of the social-patriots: Yes, the war is in the interests of the capitalists, etc.
, but we are manifestly weak, manifestly powerless to preventit.
Talk of struggle against war, of “insurrection”, etc.
, etc.
, is “piano opinion”, hopeless “exaggeration” of our strength.
A variant of the “utopianism” argument, which was advanced also in Plekhanov’s lecture.
From this point of view, the Basle resolution is a well-meaning attempt to frighten the governments, and not a resolute pledge to carry out revolutionary actions or revolutionary propaganda.
[This formulation, which reduces everything to a “pre-ventive war”, is extremely narrow—and was deliberately made so by Blatchford.
The essential thing is to utilise the crisis f o r revolutionary propaganda and to prepare for revolutionary action.

Keir Hardie said that the Kaiser was brave, soldier-like, whereas he sneered at “our fireside-loving King”.
Can the government tolerate such speeches from a Member of Parliament? “As a result in Merthyr Tydfil we have had considerable difficulty in the past few weeks in recruiting, although it had been going on handsomely before Mr.

“It is not surprising that under such, conditions [the “appalling conditions of modern warfare”] the soldiers should, in places where mud has made progress almost impracticable, conclude impromptu truces, such as are described by a correspondent in The Times of yesterday.
These truces naturally occur only in the parts of the field where the trenches are close together, but they bring home to the imagination the cruel absurdities of the war, and suggest to some a hope that from the soldiers in the field there might N.

come a protest against the indefinite prolongation of its horrors” (p.

1059, article: “The War and Modern Business.
” .

“Until the bloodiest storm in history burst at the end of July, it was hardly possible to tell where Krupp began or Creusot ended.
War loans were inextricably mingled with peace loans, and deadweight debt with full capital issues.
Whether to destroy or to construct, whether to build canals or forts, ocean liners or battleships, the whole world of business and finance seemed to have centred itself in London, Paris and Berlin.
The financial houses were almost of necessity Anglo-German, Anglo-French and Anglo-Ame-rican; directorships were interlaced, branches of agents existed in nearly all the cities of the Old World and of the New.
Monster companies and corporations welcomed share-holders of all nationalities, with very little regard for the diplomatic alliances.
.
.
.
It was a truism six months ago to say that nationality was no obstacle to business arrange-ments.
.
.
.
All this came to an end all of a sudden.
.
.
.
And yet the businessmen and the working classes are admittedly innocent.
The guilt of war is everywhere traced to a few men—emperors, diplomatists, statesmen, militarists, or ‘philosophers’.
.
.
.
Let us hope for a swift disillusionment, a return of common sense, a revival of religion, and a re-awakening of the human conscience”.

Some of the German newspapers look for a revolution in Russia.
They may have to count with one at home, for nothing is more likely than that the working classes of Germany will turn savagely upon the aggressive militarism which has been their bane.

) TRADE UNION LEADERS Trade Union Leaders The Daily Telegraph, October 7, 1915.
“After hearing addresses by the Prime Minister and Earl Kitchener, and holding lengthy conferences on the subject of recruiting, the chosen leaders of Labour have issued a strongly-worded appeal for men, in which it is stated that ‘if the voluntary principle is to be vindicated, at least 30,000 recruits per week must be raised’.
“Mr.
C.

Bowerman, M.

It reads as follows:The Crisis An Appeal to Free Men || “Fellow countrymen.

“Not only because by so doing they will be defending their own interests, but also because their action will preserve the vital interests of the nation”.
.

“We know that defeat or an inconclusive peace would mean for us not only the loss of prestige as a nation and the certainty that the conflict would be renewed in a few years’ time, but the loss of those personal liberties and privileges which have taken centuries of effort to win”.

(p.

The plunder of the natives by the European countries is especially clearly revealed in the account of the division of F a r t h e r I n d i a (Siam with British “Burma” or Burmania from the West, and French Indo-China from the East)—in Supan, p.

Summarising the results of colonisation, Supan says that it has been carried out mainly in the last fifty years (1850–1900)—p.
306 et seq.
—He distinguishes three types of colonies: 1) native (no whites or almost none.
British India belongs in this category); 2) mixed (whites in a minority; a mixture); 3) migrational colonies (marked preponderance of whites).
He gives detailed figures for America (38,331,200 sq.
km.
; 144.
2 million inhabitants, including 88.
3 million whites); Africa (26,950,900 sq.
km.
; 123.
3 million inhabi-tants); Asia (24,506,200 sq.
km.
; 390.
6 million inhabitants); South Seas colonies (8,938,300 sq.
km.
; 6.
4 million inhabi-tants).

’ We are seeing the impressof the engineer on every phase of the stupendous struggle now in progress throughout the world.
No longer is engineer-ing a side-line.
It has become the principal feature of war, so much so ‘that Eye-Witness’ has seen fit to call the pres-ent ‘the petrol war ’ in the course of his recent description of the part played by mechanical traction on the Continent.
To call it ‘the oil war’ would probably be more accurate since this term would also include the Fleet, so far as many of its greatest and smallest craft—as represented by super-dreadnoughts and submarines—are concerned.
” The Queen Elizabeth is one of the first “all-oil” vessels.

.
.
.
.
.
.
“The internal u n -viability of Austria was shown”.
.
.
.

“The Hapsburg monarchy is not the political organi-sation of a bourgeois state, but only the loose syndicate of cliques of social parasites” (49).
.
.
.
.
.
.
“An inevitable dilemma: either the Hapsburg monarchy or the capitalist development of the Balkan countries” (49).
.
.
.
.
.
.
“Historically, the liquidation of Austria-Hun-gary is but the continuation of the disintegration of N.
B.
Turkey, but at the same time it is a requirement of the historical process of development” (49-50).
“German imperialism, chained to two decomposing corpses, steered straight into the world war” (50).

p.
6 0: two causes of the 1905 defeat: (1) its “huge” political programme; “some (of the problems), such as the agrarian question, are alto-? gether insoluble within the framework of the present social order”.
.
.
.
(2) the aid of European reaction.
.
.
.
71: “The dangers to the ‘free development of Ger-many’ do not lie in Russia, as the Reichstag group thought, but in Germany herself”.
.
.
(and, inciden-tally, the expression: “the Zabern policy”, p.
71).
74: “Does not the socialist principle of the right of nations to self-determination imply that every people is entitled and bound to defend its freedom and independence?”.

(75) “certainly, a people that surrenders to an external enemy is contemptible”.

75: A quotation from T h e C i v i l W a r i n F r a n c e: “The highest heroic effort of which old society is still capable is national war; and this is now proved to be a mere governmental humbug”.

2776: “In bourgeois society, therefore, invasion and class struggle are not opposites, as the official legend has it, but one is the means and expression of the other.
And if for the ruling classes invasion represents a well-tried means against the class struggle, for the ascending classes the sharpest class struggle still proves to be the best means against invasion”.

77: The same applies to self-determination: “True, socialism recognises the right of every nation to inde-pendence and freedom, to independent mastery of its destinies.
But it is a real mockery of socialism when the modern capitalist states are presented as the expression of this right of the nations to self-determi-nation.
In which of these states has the nation yet determined the forms and conditions of its (sic!) national, political or social existence?” By “self-determination of the German people”, Marx, Engels, Lassalle under-stood “the united, great German republic”.
[Modern Germany has been built (N.
B.
) (77) “on the ruins of the German people’s right to national (N.
B.
) self-determina-tion (N.
B.
)”.
.
.
.
] 77 .
.
.
“or is it, perhaps, the Third Republic with colonial possessions in four continents, and colonial atrocities in two of them, that is an expression of the ‘self-determination’ of the French nation?”.
.
.
78: “In the socialist sense of this concept, there is not a single free nation, if its existence as a state rests on the enslavement of other peoples, for the colonial peoples, too, are reckoned as peoples and N.
B.
as members of the state.
International socialism recognises the right of free, independent and equal nations, but it is only socialism that can create such nations, and only it can realise the right of nations to self-determination.
And this socialist slogan serves like all the other socialist slogans not to justify the existing order of things, but to indicate the way forward, and to stimulate the proletariat in its active, revolutionary policy of transformation”.
.
.
.
.
.
.
In the imperialist situation of today there cannot be any more “national wars of defence” (78).
.
.
to ignore this situation means “to build on sand”.
Hence “the question of defence and attack, the question of who is to ‘blame’, is quite meaningless” (78); for both France and Great Britain it is not a matter of “self-defence”, they are defending “not their national, but their world political position”.

“in order to dispel the phantom of ‘national war’ which dominates Social-Democratic policy at pre-sent” (81).
Imperialist policy is an international phenomenon, the result of “the world-wide development of capital” (79).
.
.
.
“It is only from this starting-point that the question of ‘national defence’ in the present war can be correctly posed” (80).
.
.
.
The system of alliances, military interests, etc.
, immediately involve i m p e r i a l i s t interests and countries.
.
.
.
“Finally, the very fact that today all capital-ist states have colonial possessions which in time of war, even if it begins as a ‘national war of defence’, are in any case drawn into the war from military-strategic considera-tions” .
.
.
the “holy war” in Turkey, the instigation of upris-ings in the colonies.
.
.
—“this fact, too, today automatically converts every war into an imperialist world conflagration” (82).
.
.
.
The example of Serbia (behind which stands Russia), Holland (her colonies and so forth).
.
.
.
“In this way, it is always the historical situation created by present-day imperialism that determines the character of the war for the different countries, and it is because of this situation that nowadays national wars of defence are in general no longer possible” (84).
.
.

He quotes K.
Kautsky: Patriotism and Social-Democracy, 1907, p.
16 in particular, that “under these conditions a war for the defence of national freedom can no longer be expected anywhere” (Kautsky, quoted by Junius, p.
85).
(K.
Kautsky, pp.
12-14 on “national problems”, that they can be solved “o n l y (N.
B.
) a f t e r (N.
B.
) the victory of the proletariat”.
) [K.
Kautsky, p.

]What then is the task of Social-Democracy? Not to be “passive”.
“Instead of hypocritically dressing |||| |||| the imperialist war in the cloak of national defence, |||| we should take seriously [author’s italics] the right |||| |||| of nations to self-determination and national defence |||| |||| and use them as a revolutionary lever against |||| ? [author’s italics] the imperialist war (85).
The |||| |||| most elementary requirement of national defence |||| |||| is that the nation should take defence into its own |||| hands.
The first step in that direction is a militia, |||| |||| i.

And ||| N.
B.

But the Social-Democrats abandoned the demand for a militia until after the war!!! although we have said that “o n l y a militia” is capable of defending the fatherland!!! “Our teachers had a different conception of de-fence of the fatherland”.

“He [Engels] had in mind a genuine national war of defence by a suddenly attacked Germany” (87).

And further: “Yes, it is the duty of the Social-?? Democrats to defend their country during a great historical crisis.
And precisely therein lies the grave guilt” of the Social-Democratic Reichstag ?? group.
.
.
.
“They did leave the fatherland unprotected in the hour of its greatest peril.
For their first duty to the fatherland in that hour was to show the fatherland what was really behind the present impe-|||| rialist war; to sweep away the web of patriotic and |||| |||| diplomatic lies covering up this encroachment on |||| the fatherland; to proclaim loudly and clearly that N.

finally, to oppose the imperialist war pro-gramme, which is to preserve Austria and Turkey, i.
e.
, perpetuate reaction in Europe and in Germany, with the old, truly national programme of the patriots ||||| and democrats of 1848, the programme of Marx, ||||| ?? ||||| Engels and Lassalle—the slogan of a united, great ||||| ||||| German Republic.
This is the banner that should have been unfurled before the country, which would |||| have been a truly national banner of liberation, |||| |||| and which would have been in accord with the |||| |||| best traditions of Germany and with the interna-|||| tional class policy of the proletariat” (88).
|||| .
.
.
“Hence, the grave dilemma—the interests of 100: the fatherland or the international solidarity of the proletariat—the tragic conflict which prompted our parliamentarians to side, ‘with a heavy heart’, with the imperialist war, is purely imaginary, a bourgeois-nationalist fiction.
On the contrary, there is complete harmony between the interests of the country and the class interests of the prole-tarian International, both in time of war and in time of peace: both war and peace demand the most energetic development of the class struggle, the most determined fight for the Social-Democratic programme” (89).
.
.
.
But what should the Party have done? Call a mass strike? Or call for refusal to serve in the army? It would be absurd to try to answer.
The revolution cannot be “made”.
“Prescriptions and recipes of a technical nature” would be “r i d i c u l o u s” (90); it is not a question of such things, but of a clear political slogan.
(Expatiates against technique, etc.

) (N.

§VIII (93-104) deals especially with the question of “victory or defeat”, endeavours to prove that both are equally bad (ruin, new wars, etc.
).
To choose between them would be “a hopeless choice between two lots of thrashing” (98).
.
.
“except in one single case: if by its revolutionary intervention the international proletariat upsets all the calcu-lations” (of both imperialisms) (98).
.
.

There can be no status quo (99), no going “backwards”, only forward to the victory of the proletariat.
Not hare-brained schemes of disarmament, not “utopias” or “partial reforms” (99), but the struggle against imperialism.

American Arms Suppliers.
“For some considerable time now the American press has carried reports on arms deliveries to the Entente powers.
We take the following from a California newspaper: “ ‘War material destined for the Allies is now shipped by American producers to Canada, from where British ships carry it to England.
Goods for France and Russia follow the same route, via England.
Through agents or directly, the Allies have contracts with nearly all American armaments factories.
Of course, the factories keep this a secret, for fear of having to stop their supplies, because all this material is contraband of war.
“ ‘Fifty-seven U.
S.
factories are engaged exclusively in armaments production.
They normally employ about 20,000 workers, but now, working two and three shifts, the number is about 50,000.
They do not make explo-sives.
These are produced at about 103 factories, whose output has doubled since the outbreak of the war.
Many gun-cotton factories are working three shifts.
The mass demand has, of course, resulted in higher prices.
Thus, in February the French Government ordered 24,000,000 lbs of gun-cotton at 65 cents per pound, whereas in ordi-|| || nary times the cost is 24-25 cents.
“ ‘In addition, there are items of equipment for troops and animals: footwear, utensils, saddles, tanned leather, etc.
For America, the European war means a vast, profitable business.

Article: “The Free Trade Unions and the Government” by Dr.
Hugo Böttger, Reichstag deputy.
The author begins with the fact that the managing director of a mining company (in Gelsenkirchen), Kirdorf , reproached Minister Delbrück (Minister of the Interior) for maintaining “close contact with the trade union leaders”.
This was dangerous for the workers would become more restless.
The author replies that there is no harm in this, that workers and employers are standing side by Bide in the trenches, that “if they (= the free trade unions = the Social-Democrats) are enlisted for joint work on certain labour and general national questions in the Ministry of the Interior, that is just as much a recognition of the need, as it is an obligation, for the duration of the war, to r e -n o u n c e certain provisions of the Social-Democratic programme which belong to the sphere of the Inter-N.

In § 1—“Some Remarks on Democracy and the National State”—K.
Kautsky finds fault with the Right-winger (Winnig) and a Left-winger of Halle (from the Halle Volks-blatt), who say that the principle of “the right of every nation to national self-determination” (p.
5 in the decla-ration of August 4) is out-of-date.
Kautsky favours the Centrist position on this issue, and chews over all the old stuff about the link between democracy and the national state.
In this context, he opposes “primitive democracy” and “direct national legislation” (8); moreover he includes in “primitive democracy” “its most active ! variety, the mass strike” (8).
We are not for the status quo, he says, (14) but for a differ-ent way of breaking out of the national framework.

“The proletariat cannot emancipate itself by some of its sections, engaged in definite occupations or living in definite regions, benefiting from exploitation and oppression.
That signifies rather a weakening of its position” (16).

[And not a word of conclusion from this!! The sophist!] On p.
17 a swindling distortion of the position of the Lefts.
Like the Rights, they too (he says) agree that imperial-ism is inevitable, but demand that it be countered by “the immediate realisation” (17) of socialism.
.
.
.
“This looks very radical, but is only ( !!! ) petty capable of driving everyone who does not swindler!! believe in the immediate practical implementa-tion of socialism into the camp of imperial-ism.
” This is followed by the most banal prattle about society being an organism and not a mechanism, and similar childish nonsense (with hints about the strong “national sen-timents” (18) among the workers) and the conclusion that the inevitability of imperia-lism does not imply that it is foolish to N.
B.
fight it “within this [capitalist] mode of production” (21).
“The petty bourgeois and small peasants, and even many capitalists and intellectuals”, are against imperialism and favour other means of the extension of capital (apart from colonies) (21).

(1.
00 Mk).
A model of grovelling, chauvinist blather.
A comparison with Plekhanov would be most useful!! The war = a “product of imperialist policy” (5).
In Jena (1911) Bebel said that instead of disar-mament we had rearmament and things were moving || N.
B.
|| towards “a great catastrophe” (5).
.
.

Pointing to the early twentieth-century wars and revolu-tions, Lensch exclaims: “what we are experiencing is a revo-lution” (6).
.
.
.
We German Social-Democrats, “the strongest group in the International” (6), have been the most resolute in combating our government, etc.
, etc.
, have always held up Britain as an example (as if Britain were ruled not by a “capitalist clique”, but by a “committee for carrying out the Ten Com-mandments and other laws of morality” (6-7)).
He points to the old traditions of German history and of Liebknecht, who “never entirely got rid of a certain South-German par-ticularism and hatred of Prussia” (7).
Things went so far that Kautsky maintained mastery of the seas was “indispensable” for Britain (7: where is the quotation from?) (from the standpoint of food supplies, in contrast to Germany).
.

.
! || “The danger of this line of reasoning, which, inci-dentally, corresponded to a view almost universally held in the Party, has become fully evident in the present world war” (7).

“Germany was not consulted at all in this dividing !! up of the world” (10), “and it was more to protest against this insulting disregard than to protect the not very considerable material interests of German trade in Morocco” that the German Government pro-tested against the Anglo-French agreement over Morocco.
In 1908 (the Revel meeting), the powers were already about to partition Turkey (Russia & Great Britain & France), but were prevented by the revolution in Turkey (11).
In 1914, agreements were nearly completed between Great Britain and Germany for the division of spheres in Africa (13) and in the East, etc.
—Russia is to blame for the war.
In 1913 Germany threatened war over Armenia (14).
.
.
.
“For Germany, by which we mean the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, the question of capi-!! talist expansion has become a question of national existence” (15).
The question now is not merely of dividing up colo-nies and spheres of influence, etc.
, but: “Shall the German people continue to exist as a great and inde-pendent nation, or shall a large part of its national | | !! territory, in the east as well as in the west, be torn | | away and forcibly subjected to foreign, rule?” (15).
“On which side are the interests of international socialism in general, and of the German labour move-ment in particular, in this struggle, insofar as it con-cerns the threat to British world domination?” (16).
British mastery of the seas is a continuation of the wars against the French revolution.
The monopoly of Britain towards the middle of the nineteenth century: Britain must be the “workshop” of the world.
“The much-vaunted British ‘freedom’ was based on en-slavement of the world” (20).
“Great Britain has in a certain sense been the ruling class of the world” (20).
.
.
.
In Chemnitz in 1912 (p.
417 et seq.
of the minutes) I, Lensch, quoted Engels on the decline of Britain’s monopoly and said: “International socialism, however, has not the slightest reason for helping to perpetuate this lasting supremacy of one capitalist state over all others.
That would only ! make the conditions for the victory of socialism more difficult and protracted” (22-23).

ARTICLE BY O.
B.
“EUROPEAN ALLIANCE OF STATES?” Die Grenzboten, 1915, No.
9 (March 3, 1915).
The article “European Alliance of States?” is an open letter of a certain O.
B.
to Professor G.
Heymans of Groningen.
This professor, with four other persons, form a committee calling itself “the European alliance of states”.
This com-mittee has published Heymans’s appeal: “To the Citizens of the Belligerent States”, to which the open letter in Die Grenzboten is a reply.
The open letter, inter alia, raises the question of c o l o -n i e s (p.
270).
“Is their ‘internal independence’ not also desirable? And are not the Indians, Negroes and Tatars also fully ‘equal’ with Britons, Frenchmen and Russians?”.
.
.
(270).
.
.
.
“The British colonial empire, which is quotation not founded ‘on the equality and internal from the independence’ of the colonial peoples any committee’s more than the other colonial empires, occu-appeal pies about one-fifth of the globe.
Ought Great Britain to retain this colonial empire until, perhaps, the British have died out in Britain herself, and will Germany not be allowed toobtain a single square metre of this empire, malicious! even if in the meantime her population has increased to 200 million?” (271).

Riesser’s book ends with a polemic against the socialists, upholds the official view and preaches harmony (in general, Riesser i s l i k e t h a t): ha-Even the predicted socialisation “has not mate-rialised” (p.
585).
ha!! ! ! p.
582 (p.
629, fourth edition): “ B a n k s a n d t h e S t o c k E x c h a n g e ” (Riesser’s italics): “As regards the effect of the process of concentration on the functions and structure of the Stock Exchange, it is a fact that, with the influx of commissions to the big banks the latter to a certain extent take over the functions of the Stock exchange by counter-balancing purchase and sale commis-sions, handing over to the Stock Exchange only commis-sions that do not counter-balance one another.
This applies equally to trade in securities, i.
e.
, to the capital market, and discounting operations, i.
e.
, to the money market.
“As a result, the Stock Exchange, already greatly disor-ganised by the Stock-Exchange laws, is increasingly deprived of the materials indispensable for correctly fixing current prices.
It is thus further weakened, and this can have very dangerous consequences, especially at critical times, as bad examples have proved (n o t e : in the recent period one can point to the day of the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese war).
“It follows also that the Stock Exchange is steadily losing the feature which is absolutely essential for national economy as a whole and for the circulation of securities in particular—that of being not only a most exact measuring-rod, but also an ‘almost automatic regulator of the economic movements which converge on it’”* (N o t e .

B.
|| general public opinion on the credit-worthiness and || administration of the majority of states, municipali-|| ties, joint-stock companies and corporations.
|| “In this way, Stock-Exchange establishment and || quotation of current prices, which previously gave, || as far as this is attainable, a faithful picture of || ‘economic processes nowhere else summed so reliably, || and nowhere else so recognisable in their totality’, || consequently, a picture of supply and demand, must || now lose both in accuracy and in stability and relia-|| bility, which is extremely regrettable in the || public interest.
“In addition, it is to be feared that this tendency, || which increasingly leads to exclusion of intermediaries || (brokers, etc.
), may produce an ever sharper cont-|| radiction between the banks and the Stock Exchange, || and this may be very serious.
This contradiction, moreover, would be expressed not only in a certain tension, already noticeable between the banks and other circles interested in the Stock Exchange, but also in the latter’s most fundamental field of activity, namely, the establishment of current prices.
|| “Actually, today even among experts the concepts || bank and Stock Exchange, which some consider, || quite wrongly, to be completely equivalent, [n o t e : || that is the view of Eschenbach in the Transactions of the Union for Social Politics of September 16, 1903: Schriften des Vereins für Sozialpolitik, Vol.
CXIII] are in many cases termed direct opposites, which is also quite wrong” (note: cf.

Riesser, p.
354 (p.
384): “The progress of the preceding period (1848-70), which had not been exactly slow, compares with the rapidity with which the whole of Germany’s national economy, and with it German banking, progressed during this period (1870-1905) in about the same way as the speed of the mail coach in the N.
B.
good old days compares with the speed of the present-day automobile .
.
.
which is whizzing past so fast that it endangers not only innocent pedestrians in its path, but also the occupants of the car”.
.
.
.
* And alongside the above, in the very next sentence, Riesser, this bourgeois vulgarian (essentially an out-and-out philistine) and lackey of the money-bags, sees the guarantee of “public security ” and “real progress” in the “greatest virtue” of the leader: m o d e r a t i o n!!! And on the next page (355—p.
385) he admits that banks are .
.
.
“enterprises which, by their very functions and development, ‘are not of a purely private-business charac-ter’,1 ) but are more and more outgrowing the sphere of purely private-business regulation”.
** 1 ) From Riesser’s speech as president of the first all-German bankers’ congress in Frankfurt-am-Main, September 19-20, 1902.
But this admission does not prevent this bourgeois idiot from writing: “The other consequence, too, predicted by the socialists, of the process of concentration, that it is bound to lead finally to the socialisation !!ha-of the means of production, which the socialists ha!! aim at and which is to be realised in the ‘state hail of the future’, has not come true in Germany, “refuta-and is hardly likely to come true later on”*** tion.

This is the so-called Morgan trust.
Content of the agreement: division of profits and d i v i s i o n o f t h e w o r l d (German companies would not compete in Anglo-American freight traffic; agreement stipulated which ports were to be used by each, etc.

).
A joint control committee was set up.

“The estimates vary widely, of course, but an annual increment of at least 1,000 million francs is generally accept-ed.
Henri Germain, former director of the Crédit Lyonnais, estimated this annual increase (in the years immediately preceding 1905) at 1, 5 0 0 m i l l i o n francs; Paul Leroy-Beaulieu recently even put it at ,5 0 0 m i l l i o n francs.
“The well-known British financial policy expert, Sir Edgar Speyer, in a lecture at the Institute of Bankers (‘Some Aspects of National Finance’) on June 7, 1900, estimated total B r i t i s h investments abroad at £,5 0 0 million, i.

, about 5 0 , 0 0 0 m i l l i o n marks, with an annual yield of £110 million (8); his estimate for the end of1910, in a lecture in the Liberal Colonial Club, is £3,500 mil-lion, or about 70,000 million marks.
“This corresponds approximately to George Paish’s esti-mate for 1907-08, about £2,700 million, i.
e.
, about 54,000 million marks, nearly equally divided between India and the colonies (£1,312 million), and other foreign countries (£1,381 million).
The same author gives the figure of £3,192 million, or about 6 4, 0 0 0 million marks, for the end of 1910, and in a lecture to the Royal Statistical Society he estimates the 1911 income from British investments abroad, on the basis of the yearly Reports of the Commis-sioners of Inland Revenue, at approximately £180 million which, however, Sir Felix Schuster in a discussion on Speyer’s lecture of May 27, 1911, regards as too high” (p.

Philippovich (Outline, 7th edition, p.

e.
, stocks and, mortgages).
Schmoller (statistical supplements to the Minutes of the Stock-Exchange Enquiry Commission, 1892-93) estimated in 1892 that about one-quarter of total Prussian capital, nearly 16,000-20,000 million marks, was invested in securi-ties.
Sombart (The German National Economy in the Nine-teenth Century, p.
224) puts the stock capital of Germany in 1900 at 31,000-32,000 million marks” (37).
“Today this figure is definitely too low; German stock capital should be put at 45,000-50,000 million marks, which nevertheless is only about one-fifth of the country’s national wealth, estimated at 250,000 million marks” (37).
In America (;) the national wealth in 1904 was 107,000 million dollars.
About one-third was stock capital.
“For Great Britain he (;) gives the stock capital as 26,000 million dollars, for France—19,500 million dollars.
The figure for the whole of Europe is about 75,000 million dollars” (38).

Minor “polemic” between Karl Kautsky and Leipziger Volkszeitung (Rosa Luxemburg) over a United States of Europe—remarks which do n o t touch on the essence of the matter, but are indicative of the polemic that is being conducted in Leipziger Volkszeitung.
Leipziger Volkszeitung attacked also Ledebour for his statement: “We put .
.
.
to capitalist society .
.
.
the demand .
.
.
that they [the statesmen] prepare to unite Europe in a United States of Europe in the interests of Europe’s capitalist development, in order that later on Europe shall not be completely ruined in world competition” (p.
276).
This, it says, is the same argument Calwer used in urging a customs union against America.
Kautsky retorts: no, it is not the same.
In Ledebour’s statement there is not a word about a customs struggle, only about a United States of Europe, “an idea which .
.
.
is not necessarily spearheaded against the U.
S.
A.
” (277).
((Consequently, an idea of peaceful competition!)) Karl Kautsky, p.
248, says that both Parvus and Johann Philipp Becker are (or were) in favour of a United States of Europe.
Ibidem, pp.
943-44 (September 29, 1911), report of an article by H.
Quelch (in The Social-Democrat, 1911, August), who says that the capitalists, too, favour peace (capital, he says, is already international): capital can already create a “United States of the W o r l d” (N.

From the war Quelch (c o n t r a r y t o Karl Kautsky) expects not revolution, but economic prosperity, deliver-ance from the “pressure of production”.

30, April 28, 1911 (pp.

Karl Kautsky, “W a r a n d P e a c e”.
Karl Kautsky pronounces in favour of peace propaganda and f o r United States of Europe (§ 3 of the article is i n f a c t h e a d e d: “A United States of Europe”).
Karl Kautsky is against the proposal to decide beforehand to r e p l y to war by a strike (here there is a passage he quoted in 1915, that the people (“the population”), the “ crowd ”, would itself kill opponents of the war if it consid-ered the frontiers in danger, if it feared invasion—p.
104, etc.
, etc.
).
But, in quoting s u c h passages from this 1911 article, K a u t s k y in 1915 did n o t quote the following pas-sages: 1) In §1: “ D y n a s t i c W a r a n d P e o p l e ’ s W a r .
” N.
B.
((My emphasis.
)) .
.
.
“In the eighteenth century the princes regarded the states merely as their domains.
.
.
.
.
.
.
“ In the same way the capitalists of the various nations of Europe (and of the U.
S.
A.
) now regard the various nationalities outside European civilisation as | | their domains, and the antagonisms between the various | | capitalist governments arise m e r e l y from the endeav-our to enlarge or round off these domains—the | | | colonies and ‘spheres of influence’.
J u s t l i k e | | | the dynastic antagonisms of the eighteenth century.
And t o d a y the welfare of the peoples of Europe is n o m o r e related to this than two centuries ago”.
.
.
(p.
99).
2) “The conviction is growing that a European war || i s b o u n d , b y n a t u r a l n e c e s s i t y , t o e n d || in s o c i a l r e v o l u t i o n.
This is a strong, perhaps || the strongest, motive for the ruling classes to preserve || peace and demand disarmament” (p.
100).
|| 3) “War is followed by revolution with i n e v i t a b l e || c e r t a i n t y , not as the product of a Social-Democratic || plan, but due to the i r o n logic of t h i n g s .
The || statesmen themselves now reckon with the possibility || of this outcome” (p.
106).
.
.
.
“Whether the revolution arises from the competition in armaments or from war—it will in any case be an i n t e r-n a t i o n a l p h e n o m e n o n” (p.
106).
.
.
.
.
.
.
“Even if the revolution does not arise from reaction against the burden of armaments or against the horrors of war, but from other causes, and if at the outset it is not international, but restricted to a single state, i t c a n n o t r e m a i n s o f o r l o n g under present conditions.
It [the revolution] i s b o u n d to spread to other states” .
.
.
(107).
And from this Karl Kautsky deduces the United States of Europe “and its eventual expansion into the United States of the civilised world”.
p.
1 0 5 : Karl Kautsky defines the United States of Europe as an alliance “with a c o m m o n t r a d e p o l i c y ” (& a single parliament, etc.
, a single army).
In § 1 of the article (p.
97), Karl Kautsky describes “the change in the world situation” (“during the last two decades”).
.
.
.
“Industrial capital has become finance capital, it has united with the landowner-monopolists”.
.
.
.
“Social reform has come to a complete standstill”.
.
.
.
“Nevertheless [despite all the difficulties of realising the United States of Europe] the effort to peacefully unite the European states in a federative community is by no means hopeless.
Its prospects are bound up with those of the revolution” (K.
Kautsky’s italics, p.
106).

The monopoly position of the farms (a region 50-100 km.
around the big towns) and the growth of co-operatives are factors in favour of cartels in this field.

The history of some milk cartels.
The Berlin Milk Cartel.
Founded June 1900.
A f i e r c e s t r u g g l e against wholesale traders (the public support-ed the traders).
B o l l e (the biggest Berlin milk firm—sells 45 million litres per annum; capital 10,000,000 marks; dividend 8 per cent, p.
91) in 1903 made peace with the milk cartel.
(In a short time, Bolle became a millionaire; as also Pfund in Dresden, who sells 21 million litres).
Milk syndicates always improve hygienic conditions.
But the present one was badly off financially and went bankrupt on February 27, 1907.
Hamburg.
Founded in June 1900.
During ten years it gave its members 10.
3 million marks (p.
53), raised t h e i r price (from 11.
2 to 14.
1 pfennigs), and concluded an agree-ment with the big traders.
Frankfurt-am-Main.
When was it founded?? In 1911 it was very powerful.
It concluded an agreement with the traders.
Afterwards it demanded that they raise the price from 16 pfennigs to 17.
“Over this pfennig a three months’ bitter war broke out between the farmers and the traders, who were supported both by the Social-Democratic and liberal workers’ unions, and by the trade union association” (p.
54).
The traders gave way.
“The struggle ended with traders, to the great astonish-ment of the consumers, forming an alliance with Vereinigte Landwirte [the United Farmers, a cartel], by which the latter were pledged not to deliver milk to traders who did not join in the price increase” (p.
55).
In Vienna there is a huge syndicate.
It large-lowered sales costs from 7.
67 hellers per litre scale in 1900 (turnover 0.
56 million kronen) to produc-3.
775 hollers in 1910 (turnover 6.
74 million tion!! kronen) (p.
57).
Influence of cartels on the producers? Prices rose by an average of 2 pfennigs in 1900-10 (com-pared with 1890-1900) (p.
61).
The price rise was caused by the cartel (otherwise higher production costs would not have increased the price).
“What other explanation is there for the striking fact that prices began to rise precisely in the years when the milk cartel appeared on the scene?” (63).
“Lastly, what other explanation, save the existence of cartels, is there for the fact that the highest price increases were in the richest milk areas: Switzerland and Württem-berg?” (64).
Bigger sales of milk worsen both food for cattle (p.
66) and f o o d f o r t h e p o p u l a t i o n (67).

Effecton trade? Profits declined from 7-8 pfennigs per litre to 6-7 pfg.
(72),—gradual squeezing out of trade.
On consumers? Better quality, hygiene, etc.
Best of all in Basle, where the consumers’ association and peasants’ milk association directly confront each other.
The milk trade is run by the city in an e x e m p l a r y way, but as regards prices the consumer is dependent on the p e a s a n t s!! “According to Professor Kasdorf, the average daily milk yield of a cow is 5 litres in Austria, 8-10 litres in Ger-many, and 12 litres in Denmark” (p.
83).

Pp.
296-97—“Employer Organisations on the War”.
.

“Consequently [employer organisations] are thinking in terms of the rise and development of a special German type; that is what the war is about.
That view, in fact, fully coincides with the || employers’ interests.
They are aware of a certain || N.
B.
danger to themselves if it were to be said after the war: vestra res agitur (the matter concerns you), your skin and your interests are at stake! The war is being waged to decide who shall hold sway on the world market!” (Deutsche Arbeitgeberzeitung, February 7, 1915).
In that event, obviously, all socio-political tendencies, all efforts to cover war expenditure out of employ-er profits would find ready acceptance.
If,however, the war is being waged in the interests of civilisation, to defend a type of civilisation and not profit interests, then it falls to Society as a whole to bear the burdens of war, and it will not be possible to single out a class whose interests are pro-eminently promoted by the war.
|| The employers regard the effects of the war, || || insofar as they extend to the internal political || || situation, as predominantly favourable.
This || applies especially to its effect on the Socialist Party, and in this respect they praise “fate as educator”.
For the war has led to unity of the nation and has cut the ground from under the most attractive socialist theories.
(Ibid.
, August 2, 1915.
) In this war the nation has for the first time really become a nation (to borrow Treitsch-ke’s expression)—and this is in itself justification for the war.
.
.
.
For centuries to come, war will still be the sole form of settling disputes between states, and it is a form to be welcomed, for the war has halted the trend towards democracy: “We have reached the limit of feebleness, the brink of degeneration and debility.
From the final extreme, however, from sinking into the abyss, we have been saved by fate, which evident-ly has set our German people a special goal.
” (Ibid.
, August 16, 1914.
) “The meaning of the war in general is thus consistently being sought in a transformation of the soul; its serious economic and political implications are belittled; its serious political and economic consequences are rejected”.
“The German Government’s further measures, it is correctly pointed out, were likewise directed at regulating consumption, whereas the aim of socialism is socialisation of the means of production.
(Ibid.
, February 28, 1915.
) All these measures will therefore be discontinued with the coming of peace.
These views are, on the whole, in the interests of the employers.
And the antagonism between the class interests of the employers and the workers probably|| finds its most salient expression also in the || || contrasting way the war is reflected in their || || ideologies.
But the contrast is of a manifold || nature.
The socialists of the opportunist, revi-sionist trend see the war as an economic war.
They take the view that the war is imperialist and even defend the right of every nation to imperialism.
From that they deduce a community of interests between employers and workers within the nation, and that line, followed con-| sistently, leads to their becoming a radical | bourgeois reform party.
On the other hand, | the radical trend in the socialist workers ’ movement, while regarding the war as imperial-ist (at any rate, with reservations), negates this development—it demands intensification of the class struggle as a consequence of the war and emphasis on the proletarian stand-point, even during the war.
The employers, however, as we have seen, deny that the war is an imperialist one.
They do not want to be told: Tua res agitur (it is your concern).
They reject both the positive, affirmative imperialist view of the revisionist socialists and the critical attitude of radical socialism.
They seek salvation in the “civilisation meaning” of the war, an inter-pretation that does not hold any class respon-sible for the war, and does not accuse any class of especially benefiting from it.
A grotesque picture: while the governments everywhere uphold the imperialist theory or, at least” (how nice!!) “contend that for the other side the economic interest is decisive, the chief repre-sentatives of economic interests retire behind the general civilisation meaning of the war.
As a result, they come into contact with views to be found also in the camp of radical socialism; they regard the war as economically only an interim phase; all war-time phenomena, all measures taken by the state, stem from the pres-ent situation and will disappear together with well said! how nice! gem!the war.
The employers’ views on the war, too, however much they may appear to have a central idea, should therefore be regarded exclusively as (class) ideology” (pp.
295-97).

Agriculture in Japan has special features, it accounts for 60 per cent of the population (p.
481).
Out of a total number of households of 9,250,000, 3,748,000 are engaged exclusively in agriculture; 1,662,000 combine other occu-pations with agriculture.
Other farmers = 70,000.
Land-owners = 43,000.
Σ = 5,523,000.
The land is very heavily taxed.
Agriculture is on an extremely small scale: Per cent of farms (p .

00 The productivity of agricultural labour is extremely low, chiefly owning to the small scale of agriculture and the absence of machines.
In Japan, the production of rice requires 110 days’ labour per acre.
In Texas and Louisiana, the production of rice per acre requires one man for two days & a team for 1 2 days.

“The more one looks into the financial and polit-ical future of Europe after the war the darker and more obscure do its problems appear.
But that is all the more reason why independent men with knowledge and penetration and foresight should exercise their minds upon the political economy of this war.
Never has there been such a collision of forces, never so much destruction in so short a time.
Never has it been so difficult or so necessary to measure the calamity, to count the costs, to foresee and provide against the consequences to human society.
Philanthropists profess to hope that the peace settlement will bring with it a great international reduction of armies and armaments, which will enable the nations to support their new war debt, and so to avoid theN.

No doubt the fear of bankruptcy will count for something; otherwise the peace settle-ment might be expected to breed another series of preparations for another series of wars.
But those who know the forces which really control the diplom-acy of Europe see no Utopias.
The outlook is for bloody revolutions and fierce wars between labour and capital, or between the masses and the governing classes of Continental Europe”.

Real colonisation consists in people of the metro-polis emigrating to an empty uncolonised country and bringing their civilisation to it, but the forced subjection of other peoples is already a “ debasement of this genuine national-ism ” (“ spurious colonialism ”); it is already a phenomenon of an imperialist order.
A model example of a real colony is seen in Canada and the self-governing islands of Austral-asia.

In Germany, literature on the necessity for her to have colonial possessions arose in the seventies.
The first official aid to the German Commercial and Planta-tion Association of the Southern Seas was given in 1880.
The “German connection with Samoa” belongs to the same period, but real imperialist policy in Germany began from 1884, when the African protectorates arose and the islands of Oceania were acquired.
During the next fifteen years, a million square miles, with a population of 14,000,000, in the colonies was brought under the influence of Germany.
Most of the territory was in the tropics, with only a few thousand whites.
In France, the old colonial spirit began to revive at the very beginning of the eighties.
The most influential econo-mist conducting colonial propaganda was Leroy-Beaulieu.
In 1880, French possessions in Senegal and Sahara were extended, a few years later Tunisia was acquired, in 1884 France took an active part in the struggle for Africa and at the same time strengthened her rule in Tonkin and Laos in Asia.
Since 1880, France acquired 3 2 million square miles with a population of 37,000,000 almost wholly in * See present edition, Vol.

tropical and subtropical countries, inhabited by lower races and unsuitable for French colonisation.
In 1880, Italy’s Abyssinian expedition came to grief and her imperialist ambitions suffered defeat.
Her posses-sions in East Africa were limited to Eritrea and a protector-ate in Somali.
The African agreement of 1884-86 gave Portugal the extensive region of Angola and the Congo Coast, and in 1891 a considerable part of East Africa came under her political control.
The Congo Free State, which became the property of the King of Belgium in 1883 and which has been considerably enlarged since then, must be regarded as a morsel seized by Belgium in the struggle for Africa.
Spain has been kept away from the arena of the struggle for the world.
Holland does not take part in the modern imperialist struggle; her considerable possessions in the East and West Indies are of older origin.
Russia, the only one of the northern countries pursuing an imperialist policy, directs her efforts chiefly to the seizure of Asia, and, although her colonisation of Asia is more natural, since she proceeds by extending her state frontiers, she will soon come into conflict with other powers in regard to the division of Asia.

The consequence of markets seized by France and Germany being closed to Great Britain has been that the latter has closed her markets to them.

The manufacturer and trader are satisfied by trading with other nations; the investors of capital, however, exert every effort “towards the political annex-ation of countries which contain their more speculative investments”.
Capital investment is advantageous for a country, opening new markets for its trade “and employment for British enterprise”.
To refrain from “imperial expansion” means to hand over the world to other nations.

Free competition has always been accompanied by “over-production”, which led to prices falling to such a level as to remove weaker competitors from the arena of competition.
The first step in the formation of a trust is the closing down of the worst-equipped and worst-situated factories, and the cutting of production costs by using only the most up-to-date machines.
“This concentration of industry in ‘trusts’ .
.
.
at once limits the quantity of capital which can be effectively employed and increases the share of profits out of which fresh savings and fresh capital will spring.
” The trust arises as an antidote to over-production, to excessive investment of capital in the given industry; hence not all the capital which the participants in the trust want to put into circulation can be invested within the frame-work of the trust.
The trusts endeavour to invest the surplus capital so as “to establish similar combinations in other industries, economising capital still further, and rendering it ever harder for ordinary saving men to find investments for their savings”.

They need Imperialism because they desire to use the public resources of their country to find profitable employment for the capital which otherwise would be superfluous.
“It is not indeed necessary to own a country in order to do trade with it or to invest capital in it, and doubtless the United States can find some vent for its surplus goods and capital in European coun-tries.
But these countries are for the most part able to make provision for themselves: most of them have erected tariffs against manufacturing imports, and even Great Britain is being urged to defend herself by reverting to Protection.
The big American manu-facturers and financiers will be compelled to look to China and the Pacific and to South America for their most profitable chances.
Protectionists by principle and practice, they will insist upon getting as close a monopoly of these markets as they can secure, and the competition of Germany, England, and other trading nations will drive them to the establishment of special political relations with the markets they most prize.

“The rich will never be so ingenious as to spend enough to prevent over-production.

The normal healthy processes of assimilation of increased world-wealth by nations are inhibited by the nature of this Imperialism, w h o s e essence consists in developing markets for investment, not for trade, and in using the superior economies of cheap foreign produc-tion to supersede the industries of their own nation, and to maintain the political and economic domination of a class.

A modern army would swallow the insurgent towns one after the other, like eating strawberries.
In a twentieth-century war, that would be settled in a week! By a hurricane of shells and concentrations of artillery! How the devil would our towns find the time to unite and organise a joint defence, that is to say, if I am not mistaken, to return to a national army capable of withstanding the blow? “.

“To shout vaguely: ‘Down with war!’, to threaten the sky with clenched fists and to imagine that this is a safe-guard against war, is sheer childishness! It is not enough to fear war in order to save oneself from it, nor to curse it in order to avoid it” (pp.
128-29).

We do it voluntarily; each year, of our own good will we deprive French industry of its natural food while nourishing foreign industry with our savings.

“ ‘You give no thought to the fact,’ he said, ‘that they will demand the admission of German securities on the Paris Stock Exchange!’ “I have given much thought to it, and M.

“For France, the sole result of a Franco-German entente should be to finally establish European peace and ensure for the future the conditions for France’s free development and legitimate influence in a consolidated Western Europe” (p.

“To unite with them” (( w i t h w h o m ? )) “to destroy the Germans or put them under their yoke, which we, too, would not escape for long, would mean showing the world a France working on the side of barbarism against civilisation” (p.

“For my part, I make no attempt to conceal my opinion that a Franco-German rapprochement would be a tremendous historical development, fraught with great consequences and inaugurating a new era for the whole world.
On the one hand, in present circumstances, it would be positive, narrow and limited, and, for France, dictated solely by the desire to avoid an imminent war.
On the other hand, for the future, it would, I believe, be the embryo of a United States of Europe” (p.

“Acclaim peace? We have come here to protest against and combat a scourge, an abomination, war, which we hate, and the scoundrels who are preparing it.
“‘But, since you hate war, you must love peace!’ “That seems clear, logical, irrefutable.
Yet, despite this logic, something deeply imbedded in the spirit of the people says no.
And the spirit of the people is right.
“‘Long live peace!’—just that cry and no more? Con-sequently, this peace suits us? We are satisfied? Never! If you like, let us shout: ‘Long live the social revolution!’ but not ‘Long live peace!’.
Down with war is all right because its meaning is clear and true.
Yes, we hate all war of whatever kind; but it is not true that we love all peace.
The working people do not love bourgeois peace, a peace in which, without a battle, they are treated as vanquished.
They feel vaguely that by acclaiming such a peace they will create the impression that their only desire is to end the inquietude and return to the everyday routine, to the drudging of the treadmill.

“He feels this deeply, and if he despises this warlike enthusiasm, it is because he knows another enthusiasm and another war, which seem to him to be superior, and from the height of which he contemplates with compassion and disdain this old enthusiasm of the soldier, which he has known and outlived” (pp.

“The worker who has nothing in peacetime, has nothing to lose in wartime.

“Great Britain is gradually becoming transformed from an industrial into a c r e d i t o r s t a t e .
Notwithstand-ing the absolute increase in industrial output and the export of manufactured goods, there is an increase in the relative importance of income from interest and dividends, issues of securities, commis-sions and speculation for the whole of the national economy.
In my opinion, it is precisely this that forms the econo-mic basis of imperialist ascendancy.

8 “One can, therefore, fully agree with the imperial-ists in their appreciation of the value of colonial markets.
But, in opposition to the financial reform advocates, it has to be noted that Great Britain has not so far required preferential tariffs in order to dominate these colonial markets.
The best that Britain can expect from such preferential tariffs is to strangle the slowly penetrating foreign capital in the future”.

Incidentally, imperialist trends are strengthened by the fact that “some of these [foreign] protectionist states gain possession of ever more extensive raw-mate-rial areas and monopolise them for their own highly protected industry and shipping.

“As a creditor state, Great Britain does not depend on the free-trade interests of Britain as an industrial country; on the contrary, under certain circumstances, she is interested in accelerating colonial development through financial reform.
Such is the inner connection between the Stock Exchange and imperialism, between foreign policy and Britain’s interests as a cred-itor.
“The creditor state is steadily advancing to the forefront, compared with the industrial state.
At any rate, G r e a t B r i t a i n’s income as a creditor is already many times greater than net profit from all h e r f o r e i g n t r a d e .
Giffen estimated that in 1899, net profit from foreign trade was £18 million on a total import and export turnover of £800 million whereas, according to a most cautious estimate, the interest on foreign loans was already £90-100 million.
Moreover, it is rapidly growing, while the per-capita foreign trade income is diminish-ing.
It should also be borne in mind that wars and war indemnities, annexations and foreign concessions stimulate Stock-Exchange security issues and that the leaders of the financial world can use most on the press to cultivate imperialistic sentiment.
There can be no doubt, therefore, about the economic foundations of imperialism” (321).
((but, he adds, not only economics: also ideas, religion, and so on and so forth)) “The dependence of the most important and effec-tive financial interests of the London Stock Exchange on political imperialism is especially noticeable: the South Africans received a victory reward in the form of Chinese labour that they could never have obtained from old Krüger or from a reformed Volksraad.

“The creditor state is laying a deep imprint on some parts of Great Britain.
Free trade or financial reform is, in a certain way, an issue of struggle between the industrial state and the creditor state, but, at the same time, it represents the contradiction between the ‘suburbia’ of Southern England with its villas, where industry and agriculture have been forced into second place, and the productive factory regions of the North.
Scotland, too, has been largely taken over by the rentier class and shaped to serve the needs of people who go there for three to four months in the year to play golf, travel in cars and yachts, shoot grouse and fish for salmon.
Scotland is the world’s most aristocratic ‘play-ground’; it, as has been said with some exaggeration, lives on its past and Mr.

Sport.
The Puritans waged a struggle against it.
Sport is the sole occupation of “members of the idle, rich class” (362).
“Characteristically, the favourite forms of national sport have a strongly plutocratic stamp” (362).
“They [these forms of sport] assume the existence of a breed of aristocrats who live on the labour of Negroes, Chinese and Indians, on interest and ground-rent flowing in from all over the world, and who value the land of their own country only as a luxury item” (363).

“For Great Britain, the question is whether the rentier class has a sufficiently strong neck to bear the social and political yoke which socialism would like to impose on it.
Do the British rentiers already possess enough wealth to be bled for the honour of consuming goods produced by Brit-ish workers, who have an eight-hour day and a ‘living wage’?” (374).
“The social protective tariff”, the idea behind it: the worker is interested in h i g h prices (Fabian Tract No.
116)—p.
375—so that the country should be richer and able to give the worker a greater share.
| “It” (the realisation of such ideas) (der Ausbau) “is pos-| sible, perhaps, for a twentieth-century Great Britain on the | basis of a rentier class which exacts tribute from extensive | raw-material areas, pays for raw materials and foodstuffs | with interest coupons and dividend warrants, and defends | its economic domination by political imperialism.
Any attempt to bring the socialist state of the future out of the clouds and on to the earth, would have to reckon with the fact that this is possible only on the basis of a strictly national organisation.
The country closest to the social utopia, the Australian Commonwealth, would be lost if, with the words ‘Proletarians of all countries unite’, it took the Chinese coolie to its heart.
The Britain || of which the Labour Party dreams is b y n o m e a n s || t o b e d i s m i s s e d out of hand a s a u t o p i a , || but it would be an artificial social structure and would collapse owing to a revolt of the debtors, whom the ruling creditor state would no longer have the strength to subdue by political means” (375).

Very valuable admissions (1) the “connection” between socialism and N.

Idealism in the service of imperia-lism: “Economic activity as such does not raise man above the ‘animal world’; this is achieved only by subordinating economic life to supra-economic aims.
Thereby, and only thereby, does the simple workman, as also the world ruler, become civilised man in the economic sphere.
Idealistic population policy, idealistic national policy, and idealistic social policy require a broad economic foundation, which is thus included in the ‘realm of aims’; they present expand-ing claims for which the stagnated and fettered type of econo-my of the previous period does not suffice.
In order to cope with our cultural tasks, we need the broad shoulders of the forward-storming Titan called modern capitalism” (401).
The nation which achieves this “will—for the good of mankind and by Germany the will of God—be at the head of the at the head human race” (402).
of the world End In general, everything of scientific value has been stolen from Hobson.
He is a plagiarist in the cloak of a Kantian, a religious scoundrel, an imperialist, that’s all.

*) Statistisches Jahrbuch für das Deutsche Reich, 1915.
France Per-capita consumption ( kg .
) GermanyThe authors’ general conclusions: “As already indicated, grain production in the last decades has developed very unevenly in the various countries owing to differences in population and communications factors.
In the centre of Western Europe, where development is towards, so to say, urbanisation—in Great Britain, Belgium, Holland, etc.
—the decline in crop areas and the increase in relative yields have resulted in diminishing produc-tion of wheat, rye, barley and maize, whereas produc-N.
B.
tion of oats, used mainly for livestock, has increased.
“In all other parts of Western Europe, except for the border regions, a certain fluctuation is to be observed; expansion of crop areas has stopped, but yields are increasing considerably, and production of almost all cereal crops continues to increase.
In the border regions between Western and Eastern Europe, in Sweden, Poland, Galicia, Hungary, etc.
, total production is growing very considerably owing to expansion of crop areas, and still more to much higher yields.
In Eastern Europe, chiefly as a result of larger crop areas, grain production has risen || N.
B.
enormously, but only in the main cereals, not the || secondary ones.
“In overseas areas, a distinction should be drawn between such countries as the United States, Canada, Argentina and Uruguay, whose geographical position and the development of communications and the railway system have brought them into much closer contact with the densely populated centres of Western Europe, and all the other areas.
The former have developed their grain production chiefly by extending crop areas, sometimes very rapidly-among the latter, N.
B.
however, only a few have increased production.
Limit-ed production has obliged Egypt and Japan to import grain; Algeria and Tunisia, as a result of French eco-nomic policy, mainly supply France, while India, South Africa and Australia, because of their popu-lation conditions and underdeveloped communications system, have not produced any stable, big surpluses N.
B.
over and above domestic requirements” (p.

I have gone through the 1892 edition (15th year of publication) and have inserted additions in the preceding pages.
The 1890 figures for the “Malay states” are given only in total; there is nothing in brackets (not even the words: “Borneo, Celebes, etc.
”, which occur in the 1915 edition of the Statistisches Jahrbuch für das Deutsche Reich).
There are data by decades: 1840 and subsequent years (up to 1890)—which appear also in the Brockhaus Encyclo-paedia.
Value estimates (mostly 1888-91) are given: Europe average 302,500 marks per km.

Russia (even official Russia) could not have wanted the war.
Russia had been preparing for 1918, 1920? A murderer five years too early?? [p.

), 3rd edition.
Not a bad outline, mostly devoted to Great Britain and Japan (and to America and Russia in connection with them.

91-167) describes the British foreign policy structure (not a state, but “society”).

Georg Wegener, India Today.
The Basis and Problems of British Rule in India.
(Colonial Studies, No.
61-63.
1.
20 marks), Berlin, 1912 (52 pp.
).
A very good, clear, brief outline.
India—4,575,000 sq.
km.
315 million (1911) (1901—297) (1801—100) Danger of war on the part of Russia: the British are now armed “to the teeth” here.
There is no one nation, no one language.
“Bengalis”= 70 million.
The British partitioned Bengal (in order to weaken the national movement) in 1905, andin 1911 (at the coronation in Delhi) promised to a n n u l this measure.
The caste system.
The British rule by means of “divide et impera”.
.
.
.
Extreme diversity of geographical conditions.
Isolation from the rest of the world.
Medievalism (religion—the external world is nothing)— agriculture—vassalage.
Two-thirds of the country are directly under British rule, one-third consists of vassal states.
Complete dependence (of agriculture) on the summer rains (the summer monsoon= trade wind).
Otherwise there is famine.
The army—75,000 British —150,000 natives (of different ethnic groups).
The British especially exploit the enmity between the Moslems (about 60 million) and the Hindus.
The chief danger of the Sepoy rising (1857) lay in the native army going over to the insurgents.
The British were saved by dissension between different ethnic groups and the somnolence of the masses.
Deaths from plague were: 1905—1,069,140 1907—1,315,892, and so on.
British administration is purely “dictatorial” (31), an “autocracy” (31).
The Indian Civil Service consists of about 1,000 persons, a staff of excellently paid excellent officials.
Britain, he says, has given India very much (pax Britan-nica, railways, postal service, administration of justice, etc.
, etc.
).
Causes of ferment: 1) Coercion of the people by foreigners.
.
.
.
2) Rapid growth of population.
(Famines.
) 3) “Increasing agrarianisation of India”: Britain stifles industrialisation.
Swadeshi movement (=for home-produced goods) (boycott of British products).
4) Taxes.
Land taxes levied on the peasants.
5) Emergence of an intelligentsia.
Education has created “an intellectual proletariat of the worst, and politically most difficult, kind” (43)—the author is a reactionary scoundrel.
6) Formation of an Indian nation.
(The “National Congress”.
) 7) Religious movement against the British, for Asians, for their own cause, for everything Asian .
.
.
(terrorism, etc.
).
The British entrust artillery and arsenals only to white troops, p.
48.
In general, the British are extremely cautious.
K K ENGELS, “CAN EUROPE DISARM?” Friedrich E n g e l s , “Can Europe Disarm?” N u r e m b e r g , 1893.
An off-print from Vorwärts (Wörlein & Co.
).
In the Berne Workers’ Library, the c o l l e c t i o n begins with the pamphlet: Karl Marx before the Cologne Jury.
Preface: the articles were published in the Berlin Vorwärts in March 1893 “during the Reichstag debate on the Army Bill” (p.
3).
“I proceed, therefore, from this [the present, heuti-gen] situation, and for the time being propose only such measures as could be adopted today by any government without danger to the country’s security.
I am seeking only to establish that, from the purely military standpoint, there is absolutely no obstacle N.
B.
to a gradual abolition of standing armies” and if these armies are retained it is “against the internal N.
B.
enemy” (p.
3).
“A gradual reduction of the term of service by interna-tional agreement”—that is “the central point of my thesis” (p.
4)—“a general transition from the standing army to a militia ” (p.
4, i d e m, p.
3).
(Thus the essential point for Engels = transition to a militia.
This N.
B.
) The preface is dated: London, March 28, 1893.
§ I.
For twenty-five years now, Europe has been arming “unprecedentedly”.
.
.
.
“Is it not stupid then to talk of dis-armament?” (p.
5).
But the mass of the people .
.
.
call .
.
.
“for disarmament” “in all countries”.
.
.
.
Is there no way out of the blind alley except through a devastating war? “I maintain: disarmament, and thereby the guarantee of peace, is possible” (5) .
.
.
and Germany has the “power and vocation” to achieve it.
.
.
.
Further, §I describes briefly the transition to universal military service.
Its “revolutionary” (p.
6) aspect is that it enlists all men for “national defence”.
.
.
.
There must be a transition to an “international maximum term of service” “with a militia system as the ultimate goal” (7).
at first a two-year maximum, followed by 1 2 , and so on! until?? §II.
The possibility (military and technical) of a short term of service.
A long one is unnecessary.
(Excessive parade drill (9), sentry duty (9), batmen (10) and such like idiocy.
) What of the cavalry? A rather longer term would be desir-able—if the men had no previous riding training.
But much can be done in this respect, too, and besides it should be possible to have “three-or four-year volunteers” (10).
In my life I have seen the collapse of so many vaunted customs, institutions, regulations, including military ones (10)———“that I would advise everyone especially to distrust military ‘expert opinion’” (p.
11, end of § II).
§ III.
The stupidity of conservatism in military matters, because military technology is especially revolutionary.
Infantry fire 40 years ago at .
.
.
300 paces 1870-71 600-1,000 ” (artillery: 3,000-4,000) “new” up to 3,000-4,000 ” (p.
11) The necessity for military training of the youth, gymnas-tics, etc.
(13-14), route marches (in summer), field exercises (14), etc.
, etc.
And the instructors?—retired non-commissioned officers.
If they are dragged out “into the daylight of the school yard and the general code of civil law”,—“then I willwager that our rebellious (sic!!?) school youth ? will teach reason to the worst of these former N.
B.
N.
B.
oppressors of soldiers” (15).
? § IV.
Will other countries adopt it? Austria and Italy— yes.
France?—the “decisive country” (15).
Will France deceive? But Germany is much stronger: her population is greater; she has more officers, and that is very important.
(“In all previous wars there was a shortage of officers after a few months of military operations” (17)).
.
.
.
Incidentally, the “undemocratic and politically objectionable” (16) institution of volunteers has a military value for Germany ( > officers).
But in France “the three-year soldiers have simply pushed out of the army the privileged one-year volunteers.
This indicates that Germany’s level of public politi-N.
B.
cal consciousness and the political institutions it permits are far below the French level” (16) § V.
Russia? Whether or not Russia will adopt it is unimportant.
Unimportant in general; there are no officers.
The Russian soldier is very brave and fights well in a group.
Now, however, individual action is required, and here he is of no use at all, and stands no comparison with “Western soldiers” (19).
Embezzlement by government officials, etc.
, in Russia (20).
“Russia has only to lose a few battles and the scene of operations will shift from the Vistula to the Dvina and Dnieper; an Allied Polish Army will be formed in the rear of the German army, under its protection; this will be just punishment for Prussia if she has then to restore a strong Poland for the sake of her own safety” (20).
§ VI.
The internal situation of Russia is “almost desperate” .

End , REVELATIONS ABOUT THE COLOGNE COMMUNIST TRIAL, WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY ENGELS In the article “On the History of the Communist League” (dated October 8, 1885) in the pamphlet: Revelations about the Cologne Communist Trial (Zurich, 1885) Engels writes, at the end of the article: .

Marx’s postscript (January 8, 1875) to the same pamphlet: .

“After the failure of the 1848 revolution, the German workers’ movement continued to exist only in the form of theoretical propaganda, which was N.

confined moreover to narrow circles, and the Prussian Government did not for a moment deceive itself about its practical harmlessness” (73).
ENGELS, INTERNATIONAL ARTICLES THE “VOLKSSTAAT” Friedrich Engels , International Articles from the “Volksstaat” (1871-75), Berlin, 1894.
PREFACE, 1 8 9 4 In the preface (January 3, 1894), Engels says, inter alia, that in all these articles (1871-75) he calls himself a Communistand not a Social-Democrat, for a t t h a t Communists t i m e the Proudhonists in France, and or Lassalleans in Germany called themselves Social-Democrats? Social-Democrats (p.
6).
“For Marx and myself, therefore, it was quite impossible to choose such a loose expression to N.
B.
denote our special standpoint.
Today things are |||| different and the word * may be allowed to pass, N.
B.
|||| however unsuitable it is for a party whose economic |||| programme is not merely socialist, but directly N.
B.
communist, and whose ultimate political goal is to overcome the whole state and, therefore, demo-cracy as well.
The names of actual [Engels’s italics] political parties, however, never fully correspond to them; the party develops, the name persists” (p.

“Russian militarism lies at the back of all European militarism.
Acting as a reserve on the side of France in the war of 1859, and on the side of Prussia in 1866 and 1870, the Russian army on each occasion enabled the foremost military power |||| to defeat its enemies one at a time.
Prussia, as |||| |||| the foremost military power of Europe, is a direct N.

“Besides, after the Napoleonic wars, Russia took the lion’s share of the former Prussian and Austro-Polish provinces and openly came forward as the arbiter of Europe, a role she continued to play until 1853.
.
.
.
During the years of revolution, the suppression of Hungary by Russian troops was as decisive a development for Eastern and Central Europe as the June battles in Paris were for the West.
.
.
.
Russian domination in Europe ushered in the rule of reaction.
The Crimean War freed the West and Austria from the inso-lence of the tsar.
.
.
.
We have seen above that the Russian army serves as the pretext for and mainstay of all European militarism.
.
.
.
It was only because the Russian army pre-vented Austria from siding with France in 1870 that Prussia was able to defeat France and consummate the Prusso-German military monarchy” (38).
.

The talk about the “essentially aristocratic” character of the Polish movement is “silly”.

“was that the behaviour of N.

aristocrats?” (39).
The Polish aristocracy sides more and more with Russia, in order to reunite Poland, even if under Russian rule; the revolutionary masses reply by offering an alliance with the German Workers’ Party and by fighting in the ranks of the International” (39).
“A p e o p l e cannot be free if it o p p r e s s e s o t h e r p e o p l e .

A postscript (1894)—to the article “On Social Relations in Russia”—ends with this sentence: “It [the revolution in Russia] will not only rescue the great mass of the nation, the peasants, from the isolation of their villages, which constitute their ‘mir’, their world, and lead them on to the big stage, where they will get to know the outside world and thereby themselves, their own position, and the means of salvation from their present state of want, but it will also give a new impetus and new, better conditions of struggle to the workers’ movement of the West, and hasten the victory of the modern industrial proletariat, without which present-day Russia cannot find her way, whether through the village commune or through capitalism, to a socialist transformation of society” (p.

Whereas the activity of b o u r g e o i s associations is not subjected to police interference, the corporate life of party and trade union organisations is now controlled by the police.

.

“The development of the proletarian organisations during the lengthy period of consolidation of the capitalist national states was premised on the belief that great polit-ical upheavals in the foreseeable future were out of the question, and that for a long time to come the struggle would centre on a parliamentary compromise with the old en-trenched forces.
.
.
.
.
.
.
“The world war changed the situation at a stroke.
It showed that the capitalist economy had passed from the period of continuous upward development into the era of a stormy, explosive extension of its field of action.
This confronts the proletariat with the task of adapting its class organisations to the revolutionary needs of the future.
“The monstrous events of last summer caught the proletarian organisations unprepared.
It was left entirely to the local bureaucracy to determine our attitude towards these epochal political developments, as if it were a matter of the monthly control of dues stamps” (74).
.
.
.
.
.
.
“In our view, the main thing for the present opposition is to make the changes the situation requires in the form of organisation of the German proletariat.
The previous general situation in Germany N.
B for decades compelled the proletariat to engage in predominantly reformist activity.
In organisational matters this was based on the leader principle, in practical action exclusively on parliamentarism.
The historic changes we are now experiencing compel the proletariat to undertake mass action, and this presupposes that the masses are free as regards their organisation, class-conscious and independent in determining the course of their actions” (75).
And the authors even propose a “statute” (76-77).

Speaking of the abolition of slavery and of European congresses on the subject (—1890—several! p.
132), the author points out that the United States abolished slavery, “but ever since then more and more Negroes in the southern States have been forced back into a state of feudal depen-dence, so that in many places they have as good as lost the right to vote” (132).
“It seems to me that people pretty well always have the same amount of freedom.
.
.
.
Europe has now abol-ished slavery, but a sailor on a European ship would be despised by a Swahili slave for his low, exhausting labour; and what are many men and women workers in the big cities but serfs obedient to every gesture of their master?.

The audacity of an Aristophanesis unheard-of today, and in our time Luther would be prosecuted a hundred times a day for insulting the not church and bringing it into contempt, incitement bad! to class hatred, and lèse-majesté.
Such is the case also as regards slavery” (133).
In a small chapter on Ireland, the author says: “Pressure evokes counter-pressure, but mildness is interpreted as capitulation and weakness.
What then should be done? I think that everything depends on the specific nature of the weaker people one wants to win over.

“The most important event in Persia’s recent development, which is becoming ever more confused, was certainly the big loan issued jointly by Great Britain and Russia.
It is the biggest in the history of Persia: 70,000,000 marks.
A typical business deal ||| N.
B.
of modern imperialism .
Exactly the same thing ||| was done in Morocco.
A country excites the covetous-ness of some modern powerful state.
The country— it might be Cuba, or Liberia, or Iran—finds itself in difficulties; disorders occur, which, however, could be settled if there were no outside interfer-ence.
The foreign power does not allow the wounds to heal; it intensifies existing disorders and provokes new ones.
It happens that a provocateur is killed— for example, Dr.
Mauchamp in Marrakech or North American filibusters in Nicaragua—or the police in Tabriz are blamed for the disappearance of a Rus-sian soldier who has deserted (and is found some days later in a distant maize field).
In the search for the deserter, houses are broken into, even the harem of the high priest.
Embitterment naturally arises against the foreign instigators of the disorders.
Popular pas-sions reach explosion point, there are atrocities.
In reprisal, the foreign power sends in troops and at the same time presents the invaded country with a bill for the cost of the invasion.
The country cannot pay it.
What is to be done? With a friendly smile, the invading power announces it is prepared to help its dear friend out of this little difficulty and offers a loan.
The interest is, of course, not so very low, for the security offered is very unreliable.
Caught in the usurer’s claws, the country can no longer es-cape its fate—it is to be civilised by the invading friendly power” (p.

“In earlier overseas expansion, there was always a margin of elbow-room left, all Western nations had adequate place for development in their respective ‘New Europes’ and rivalry gave rise only to fruitful competition.
But now North America will not hear of more immigrants, Australia is already closing its doors, Siberia is open only to citizens of one particular country, while South Africa is revealing, with horrible clarity, the grim fact that emigration can no longer help, as it has hitherto, to obtain a ||| place in a world, which has shrunk; one ||| European will have to strangle another.
There ||| is still plenty of land even now, but the former ||| small states have become big powers, and the form-||| er big powers have become world powers and must already look about for adequate space for their future populations.
The Yankees will not allow us a single acre of Brazil, and the French envy the Italians’ possession of the barren wastes of Tripoli.
The harder struggle for existence aggravates hostility among the Europeans and |||| leads to attempts at mutual annihilation.
That, |||| |||| in its turn, is to the advantage of the East” (215).
Chapter: “The War over Cuba”: “The Yankees started out by preaching the equality of all men and aspiring for an ideal state full of peaceful, complacent happiness.
They are ending with the conviction that men are incorrigibly unequal, and with a policy of con-quest by force.
They began with freedom in everything, freedom of trade and intercourse, toleration of other religions, races and states.
They have arrived at the steepest protective tariffs, growing hostility to Roman Catholics and outright aggressiveness towards foreignraces and states.
First they prohibited the immi-gration of Chinese and deprived them of citizen-ship, then, factually, though not juridically, abolished the rights of the Negroes, the very  N.

” Chapter: “The Pacific Ocean and Australia”: “When Great Britain decided to allow her North American possessions to unite in the Dominion of Canada, the majority of the British people vehemently opposed continuation of such a risky policy.
In particular, they be-lieved there was a great danger that Australia would follow suit.
Often enough one could hear the opinion expressed that the creation of such colonial allied states as Canada would be merely the prelude to separation from the Mother-land.
Today the emergence of an Australian Com-monwealth is regarded in Britain as a triumph of colonial policy, and Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, is praised to the skies as the enlarger ||| and strengthener of the Empire! Nothing has con-N.

Instead of utilising Britain’s difficulties in their own interests, instead of seeking to loosen their ties with Britain, as pessimists had predicted, all the colonies without exception most warmly support-? ed Great Britain in her struggle.
They displayed India? not merely patriotism, but a degree of chauvinism that removed all doubt about the correctness ||| of decades of liberal colonial policy.
Australia ||| headed the colonies that contributed troops to ||| help the mother country.
Her sacrifices should be appraised the more highly since all the Austra-lian colonies were in severe financial difficulties.
Britain’s swift approval of the Union concluded between them is a recognition of their patriotism and testifies to the mother country’s faith in their loyalty” (271).

—Disraeli, Napoleon III, Bismarck.
A survey.
Tübingen, 1897 (44 pp.
).
(Preface dated March 1897.
) ((A reprint of articles from the magazine Die Zukunft)).
An instructive little book! After a short introduction on Chartism (phrases about “Chiliastic expectations” (2), about “illusions” (2) and their role in “mass move-ments”, etc.
), Adler devotes a brief chapter to Carlyle and his “social-aristocratic doctrine” (criticism of capitalism, hatred of democracy, “appeal for feudal-isation of modern economic activity” (11), “the idea of a social aristocracy”).
Then Chapter III: “Disraeli’s Social Policy.
” A Jew, an adventurer, Disraeli began as a Radical, defected to the Tories, was heavily in debt, was laughed at on his maiden speech in Parliament (1838), but became Tory leader and Prime Minister in 1868.
He propagated the ideas of the monarchy&a social aristocracy (in reality was playing on the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat).
The electoral reform of 1867 (Carlyle furiously attacked it in his pamphlet: Shooting Niagara: and After=), small concessions and advances to the labour movement, which had lost its revolutionary character, brilliant foreign and colonial policy in 1874-80.
Overall result = “an impe-rial-socialist” (p.
22)—and p a s s i m “imperial-||| socialist policy”, etc.
||| ||| For example: “I m p e r i a l -s o c i a l i s m ” !! ||| and other things, p.

35.
||| Chapter IV, on Napoleon III.
He too was an adventurer, a dreamer.
The author of “The Extinction of Pauperism” (1844).
Brilliant economic development,—brilliant foreign policy,—a furious struggle against political workers’ organisa-tions while e n c o u r a g i n g e c o n o m i c organisa-tions ((p.
32)),—mutual aid societies (flirting with all classes).
Lexis in his book on “French trade unions ” admits the undoubted improvement of the French workers’ position during 1850-70 and a measure of success of Napoleon III’s policy: “discipline and supervision of the workers, on the one hand, improvement of their material conditions, on the other—in his domestic policy Louis Napoleon never de-viated from that idea” (Lexis quoted by Adler, p.
34).
Chapter V.
“Bismarck’s Social Policy.
” Being a country of “schools and barracks”, Prussia natu-rally became a model of “imperialist social policy” (36): Bismarck’s campaign against free thought, his flirting with the workers, universal suffrage (to set the bourgeoisie and the proletariat at loggerheads), social legislation.
.
.
social insurance (Adler extols it).
In conclusion (p.
43), Adler says that this “must not” (!!ha-ha!!) be compared with the Caesarism of declining Rome, for support is given to people who work, not to good-for-nothing plebeians.
Proudhon, he says, wrote (where?) (a quotation from P r o u d h o n : ||| “We do not receive a penny from abroad”, p.
43) ||| !! that (Roman) Caesarism lived by plundering foreign ||| ||| nations, but this does not apply here.

.

.
.
was, objectively, a great step forward towards integrating the proletariat in modern society and its Cf.
Engels practical collaboration in the latter’s on cultural tasks” (44).
((The roots of social-Napoleon III chauvinism!!))—hence “imperial-social-versus ism” was “an illusion of world-historical Bismarck importance”, for it was useful, although it did not reconcile the proletariat, the enemy of Disraeli, Napoleon III and “Bonapartism” Bismarck.

The article is headed “Reaction in China”.
|| Author gives translations of the statutes || Social-of the Chinese socialist parties and organisa-|| tions.
He is struck by their “vagueness” and || ism “pious wishes”.
In Chinese, socialism and socie-|| in ty are one and the same word (Shih Hui).
A || number of socialists have been executed.
A work-|| || China er, Wen, (from Shanghai) (executed) founded || the “Workers’ Party of the Chinese Republic ”.
|| Early in 1913 it carried out a successful || three-day strike of Shanghai silversmiths.
|| Its programme is extremely unclear.
|| There was also a “Chinese Socialist Party”, || as well as a “Pure (sic!) Socialist Party”.
|| Most of the leaders have been executed.

“What a lesson—if only our trade-unionists were pre-pared to take advantage of it—is afforded by this conversationof M.
Jouhaux, secretary of the General Confederation of Labour, with the German socialist deputy, Herr Legien, on July 24 last, and at Brussels!—The date and place are symbolic.
‘What do you intend to do to avoid war?’ asked M.
Jouhaux.
‘Have you decided to take action? For our part, we are ready to respond.
’ And he adds: ‘Though the questions were put several times, Legien made no reply.
We left Brussels convinced that we would have to abandon our confidence in the good will of the German organisa-tions.
’ What conclusion does he draw from this disappoint-ment? I continue to quote his text: ‘We shall draw up an indictment to remind everyone that the sole means of assur-ing firm and lasting international relations is everywhere to take identical action for peace against war.
’ The latest developments have shown him that such joint action is not possible.
He considers that an accident and continues to cherish a utopia, the very thought of which makes one shudder.
What would have happened if Herr Legien had been a less honest man and had promised his naïve questioner assistance which later would not have been forthcoming?” But let us not think of catastrophes which have not happened.
And Junius goes on to lecture M.
Jouhaux: “People of the type of M.
Jouhaux accept, and rightly, the existence of class, or rather occupational, interests.
.
.
.
But they fail to notice one thing, namely, that an occupation exists only within a country.
Before belonging to a class, the worker or peasant, just like the bourgeois, belongs to a nation.
.
.
.
Consequently, if the workman belongs to a coun-try before belonging to a class, the country’s interest takes precedence over that of the class.
The whole error of inter-national trade unionism lies in not recognising this subor-dination, which is in the very nature of things.
It is not a question of failure to accept class interests.
It is a question of putting them in their right place.
.
.
.
The false dogmas of internationalism did not stand up for a single hour against the evidence of national necessity.
.
.
.
We only ask of them [the trade unionists] to understand the lesson of this war and, when considering their class interests, to do so in context with the national interest.
Then we shall be able to reach agreement.

.
.

Leroy-Beaulieu—in l ’H u m a n i t é—estimates the cost at 1,000 million a month for each of the five big states; seven months: 5;7= 35&15 small states and neutrals.
Σ = 50,000 million.
C l e r i c s o n t h e w a r: The curé Babut (French) drew up a projet de déclaration (which he sent to German priests): “The undersigned, Christians of Germany, Great Britain, Austria, France, Russia, Belgium, and Serbia, moved and distressed by the conflict which is ravaging and ensanguining Europe, declare: “1° Being deeply attached to their respective countries, they do not wish to do or say anything that would not be consistent with the sincere and ardent patriotism that animates them, “2° but at the same time they cannot forget or deny that God is the God of all nations and the Father of all people, that Jesus Christ is the Saviour of all; that He commandedhis people to regard and love one another as brothers, and that for the evangelical faith, as St.
Paul declares, there are no Jews and Greeks, barbarians and Scythians—and, consequently, there are no Germans and French, Austrians and Russians, but Christ is everything in all people.
“In consequence, they pledge themselves, in the sight of and with the help of God, to banish from their hearts all hate of those whom they are now compelled to call their enemies, and to do good to them if the opportunity occurs; to use all their influence to ensure that the war is waged with as much humanity as possible, that the victor, whoever he may be, does not abuse his power, and that the persons and rights of the weak shall be respected; to continue to love with a fraternal love their brothers in the faith, what-ever their nationality, to pray to God on behalf of all victims of the war without exception, and insistently to implore Him soon to cause the horrors of war to be succeeded by the blessings of a just and final peace, and to make the unfor-tunate and cruel events which we are witnessing help the advent of His divine Kingdom.
” (Journal de Genève, October 17, 1914.
) This letter was written on August 4, 1914.
It was sent by M.
Babut, the venerable pastor of Nimes, to Herr Dryander, the German court chaplain in Berlin.
Dryander replied, with a long letter, dated September 15, 1914, and signed by himself and two other clerics (Lahusen and Axenfeld)—(Journal de Genève, October 18, 1914): .

“we fully agree with propositions 1 and 2.
They are part of the patrimony common to all Christians.
Patriotism and Christianity are not mutually exclusive, on the contrary, they presuppose each other”.

the remainder, however, we accept in principle, but we cannot sign it, not wanting to give occasion, even the most remote, for it to be thought that Germany is not waging the war in accordance with the principles of humanity, etc.

) (The preface is dated O c t o b e r 1 9 1 3.
) A pretentious book by a diplomat, who wraps up the imperialist aspirations of the German bourgeoisie in florid phrases.
The chief theme is the struggle between national and cosmopolitan tendencies.
His sociological and philosophical pretensions = the stupidest neo-Kantian blather about the nation as an individual, comparisons with a forest (repeated dozens of times), about divinity and such like nonsense.
Actually, his is a topical theme, but it is wrapped up in catch-phrases about Aristotle’s “entelechy”, etc.
To complete her plans in Africa (the Cape-Cairo railway), Great Britain “now only needs to settle her differences with Germany and Belgium” (94).

“Britain’s world power has .

besides mastery of the seas, two other main pillars: the homogeneity of British culture, and the London Stock Exchange” (95) Germany has been put in a difficult position—deprived of possibilities for expansion (Asia for Russia, North Africa for France and Italy), hemmed in on both sides; has come too late (the colonies are taken) ((§7, Chapter 2, p.
101 et seq.
)).
On the Moroccan issue she has had to give way to France (105).
“The fate of German world policy will be decided on the continent” (107).

“It is possible, perhaps, to imaginea German world policy without naval superiority, but certainly not without superiority on land” (ibidem).

“This chapter of German world policy illustrates best of all the peculiarity of the Reich’s international position, its limited possibilities for expansion, the link between world and continental policy, the complex factors with which a German world policy has to reckon” (109).

“If the history of the colonial expansion of the European Great Powers in recent decades is regarded from this standpoint, it will not be difficult to see that all the wars of recent times in which the Euro-N.

.
.
.
International law and international arbitration? “On the whole, the instrument of arbitration serves only to prevent the outbreak of undesired wars, which can arise from unforeseen incidents and do not affect vital interests of the nation; but nowhere yet have vital questions of the nation been settled by arbitration or a desired war been prevented with its help” (167).
.
.
.
International socialism? (§ 5, Chapter 3, Part I, p.
172 et seq.
).
“If international socialism succeeds in completely divorcing the worker internally from the fabric of the nation and in making him merely a member of the class, then it will have conquered; for purely forcible N.
B.
means, by which the national state may then still attempt to keep the worker bound to it, must by themselves prove ineffective in the long run.
If, however, international socialism does not succeed | in this, if the internal links which connect the worker | with the organism that is called the nation remain, | even unconsciously, then the victory of international N.
B.
| socialism will be open to doubt as long as these | links persist, and will turn into defeat if it should | prove that in the last analysis these links are the | stronger” * (173-74).
.
.
.
| There is no “impoverishment” and no accentuation of class differences (174).
The workers become involved in the intensified national struggle and nationalism (175).
.
.
.
“Hence it can be said that although the socialist movement since that time” (the recent period) “has experienced a prodigious upswing, and although in all countries the socialist parties have N.
B.
greatly increased their power and influence, the international factor in the movement has not only not grown correspondingly during the same period, but has even lost in importance and drive” (175).
The electoral struggle of recent years has caused the German Social-Democrats to “conceal or play down” their internationalism (176).

“It” (German Social-Democracy) “has rejected with indignation the assertion of its opponents that in the event of war the Social-Democrats would inspire the mass of the workers supporting them to turn their weapons against their commanders and thus, jointly with the French socialists, try to prevent a war, it even treats the charge of lack of patriotism as an insult.
.
.
.
“The question (of the “national” tendency) is in the centre of the discussion, it becomes the kingpin of social-ism” * (176) .
.

“The question is only that of the actual || significance of these manifestations” (in || support of internationalism, etc.

alism of their socialist parties, that so far || ! no national war has failed to take place because of the socialists’ hostility to war, || nor will it fail to take place in the future || on that account.

“Politically, however, her (Britain’s) behaviour is wholly according to plan, her great influence in South America, especially in Argentina, is based on the activity of the London Stock Exchange in the issue of securities; also, in part, the vassal dependence of Portugal and Britain’s predominant influence in Spain” (235).

.
.
.
There are two reasons for this: the greater “thriftiness” in France and the smaller demand for money for the needs of the economy.
The Germans have been wrongly blamed for not using the Moroccan incident so as to seize the “opportunity”— “to keep Spain on anti-French lines” (236).

.
.

“If the German Reich still builds its international political influence only to a small degree on the flotation of loans, this is primarily due to the fact that, although richer than France, its capital is not so liquid” (237).

With a more rapid economic development, Germany is herself in need of capital.

In point of fact, the present social system affords the worker excellent prospects.
The majority of rich men have come from workers and small people (he refers to The History of Modern Wealth, by K.
Schmidt-Weissenfels, Berlin, 1893: “It contains instructive examples: Borsig was a carpenter, Krupp— N.
B.
a metalworker, Leitenberger—a small manufacturer, Lanna—a shipbuilding worker.

We Germans have not yet learned to value our colonies and appreciate their importance as the British do (434).
.
.
.
The workers, as a class, gain economically from the possession of colonies and from world policy.
.
.
.
Socialism is stagnation: “Unscrupulous demagogues dare to preach this idiocy to the politically immature mass of workers, presenting it as the gospel of prosperity and tranquillity” (437).
.
.
.
.
.
.
“Our Social-Democrats will not hear of the steady rise of our national prosperity.
.
.
.
They want || to unite the proletarians of all countries for the || destruction of capitalist society.
We know that || this idea has proved ineffectual both as propaganda | and in terms of useful social results.
Why, then, | insist on the destruction of the old dwellings if it is | impossible to build a common new house? There || is no answer to that, save propaganda phrases as || N.

a counterweight to the life-giving concept of the || || nation” (438).

, ARTICLE OF 1878 ON THE INTERNATIONAL AND REMARKS ON THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF NATIONS Die Neue Zeit, XX, 1, p.
585 (1901-02), M.
Bach’s translation of M a r x ’ s English Marx article of 1878: “Mr.
George Howell’s History 1878: of the International Working Men’s Associa-tion.
” Marx treats this Howell (a typical liberal labour politi-cian) with contempt, corrects a number of his lying asser-tions about the International, states that he, Marx, is the author of The Civil War in France, which he published a long time ago in The Daily News, speaks of the Interna-tional passing into a new, “higher” form, and makes other remarks on particular points.
Inter alia.
Marx writes: “By the way, a paragraph of the pro-gramme which I had the honour to indite for the General Council” (for the 1865 N.
B.
Conference) “reads: ‘The necessity of an-nihilating the Muscovite influence in Marx Europe by the a p p l i c a t i o n of| (1865) t h e p r i n c i p l e o f t h e r i g h t || (and 1878) of nations to dispose of| on self-determination t h e m s e l v e s , and the reconstruction of of Poland upon a democratic and socialist nations basis’” (p.
586).

Grünberg’s Archiv für die Geschichte des Sozialismus, 1915 (Nos.
1 and 2) contains the resolution of the C h e m -n i t z Party Congress (September 1 9 1 [September 15-21, 1912]) on imperialism (pp.
314-15 ).
The resolution emphasises: the export of c a p i t a l , the endeavour to obtain “new spheres for capital invest-ment”, employers’ organisations, their influence on the state and “the expansion drive”, the endeavour to control “large parts of the economic area of the world”.

The article speaks of Austrian “imperialism”, its “crime”.
“It [Austrian imperialism] fights solely for the interests of the reactionary Habsburg dynasty, to satisfy the lust for gold and power of the unfeeling and unscrupulous big landowners and big capitalists”.
.

.
The German newspapers “unscrupulously” call for war.

“That must never be allowed to happen.
The German proletarians—men and women—must prove by their action that they have awakened, that they have matured for freedom” .

The German Government says it wants peace.
“But the people have learnt that the government leaders’ tongues are forked like those of snakes.
” The bourgeoisie is chauvinistic, and “Only the proletariat will oppose its broad breast to the approaching disaster of a world war”.

In Russia, the struggle of the proletariat more than anything else holds back war.
“Let us not be less resolute or weaker than they are” (=the Russian workers).
“Let us not lose a minute’s time.
War is at the door.

“The exploited masses are strong enough to bear the entire edifice of the present-day order on their shoulders.
.
.
.
Will they prove too weak, shrink from privations, be afraid of danger and death, when the fight for peace and freedom calls? Will they allow free passage to a militarism which has just been branded before the widest public opinion as the brutal executioner of their sons and brothers?”For the working class, brotherhood of peoples is no “empty delusion”, but a matter of vital importance, the “solidarity of the exploited of all nations”.
“It [this solidarity] must prevent proletarians raising weapons of death against proletarians.
It must inspire in the masses the determination to use all available weapons in the war against war.
If the proletarian masses oppose the fury of world war with their all-conquering strength, this will be a battle won in their struggle for emancipation.
The revolutionary energy and passion of their struggle will mean persecution.
There will be danger, there will be sacrifices.
But should that daunt us? There are moments in the life of individuals and of nations when it is only possible to win by staking everything.
Such a moment has come.
Proletarian women, be prepared!” (p.

The Prussian policy of Germanising the Poles has up || to now cost 1 , 0 0 0 m i l l i o n marks.
Why “c o m p l e t e || || b a n k r u p t c y”? (161).
The Poles are embittered against the German schools the Polish children “know from their own experience all the bitterness of foreign rule, for there is no deeper insult to national consciousness” than that inflicted through language (162).
Polish is being kept alive in the towns.
Of the four estates (nobility, clergy, peasantry and bourgeoisie), only the last-named is irreconcilable.
German colonisation embitters the Poles and unites them nationally.
A trade boycott: “Poles, buy Polish!”The Poles cannot be “conciliated” (p.

A short article: “Against Both Juniuses.
” “Political arguments will, of course, carry no weight with those who judge only by the enormous sacrifices and suffering of this war and speak only in embitterment and desperation.
For one, however, who does not want to hit out blindly, but to analyse and judge, the situation is already quite clear.
Our readers will know from our reports of the Junius pamphlet, which seeks to persuade the German proletariat that its greatest interest lies in Germany’s defeat, to which end the working class must exert all its efforts.
It is no accident that the anonymous author of the pan-German pamphlet attacking the Reichs-Chancellor a pamphlet emanating from the Tirpitz opposition and annexationist and blood-thirsty to a degree of madness, signs himself Junius Alter, the second Junius.
Both Juniuses,one propagating Germany’s defeat and the other Germany’s world domination, actually play into each other’s hands.
And, reading the pamphlet of the first Junius, we have repeatedly asked ourselves whether it was really written by a Social-Democrat who has lost all judgement, or whether it is the work of a Russian police agent! The German working class will send both Juniuses packing.
It will continue to fight the external enemies until they are ready for a reason-able peace, and the internal enemies who want to sacrifice precious German blood for the sake of lunatic plans of con-quest.
Such is the policy of Social-Democracy, and the history of the working-class movement will thank the lead-ers who in these days are so vigorously championing this policy in the Reichstag in defiance of all attacks and slanders.

“QUITE CORRECT!” V o l k s s t i m m e (Chemnitz), 1916, No.
133 (Saturday, June 10, 1916): N.
B.
: “Quite correct.
Apropos our remarks on Comrade Dr.
Lensch’s speeches on the colonial question, the Bremer Bürger-Zeitung writes: “’The Chemnitz Volksstimme seems to be concerned for the cessation of Party strife.
However, it is probably speculating on the prospects this will present for unity between social-patriots, social-imperialists and social-pacifists, thanks to the behaviour of even the extreme Left wing of the Party Centre.
The Chemnitz Party organ is probably not far off the mark.
But as regards the radical Left, the paper’s hopes for a re-union with the social-patriots are, of course, in vain.
’ “We can confirm that the Bremen newspaper’s idea is quite correct.
We do, in fact, consider it of the very greatest importance that Party strife should cease, or at any rate be so [sic!] restricted [sic!] that it would no longer endan-|| ger organisational unity.
Even today we still confidently || || hope that the social-pacifists—which in the jargon of the || Bremer Bürger-Zeitung means the Haase-Ledebour group— || will once again join with the social-patriots (that means ||us) and the social-imperialists—that refers to the trade union leaders Lensch, Cunow, etc.
—to form a single, united Social-Democratic Party.
We are aware that the Rühle-Knief group, which has already declared that a split is the prerequisite for the Party’s further activity [Chemnitz Volksstimme’s italics], will not take part.
But the proletariat can suffer this loss without damage to its fighting capacity”.

S.
D AND THE INTERNATIONALE GROUP” Bremer Bürger-Zeitung, 1916, No.
139, June 16, 1916.
“International Socialists of Germany and the Internationale Group”.
46 Comrade Knief, now on holiday, writes to us: “The Bremer Bürger-Zeitung’s editorial comment, the day before yesterday, on the statement of the Internationale group might give rise to erroneous views on the relation between the International Socialists of Germany (I.
S.
D.
) and the Internationale group.
” The relation between these groups has been repeatedly discussed on our pages, particularly in a leading article in No.
77 (of March 31), from which we quote: “The opposition consists of two fundamentally different groups: the Party Centre (Kautsky .
.
.
Haase—Ledebour .
.
.
Neue Zeit .
.
.
Leipziger Volkszeitung, Vorwärts) .
.
.
and the radical Left, to which belong .
.
.
the I.
S.
D.
and the Interna-tionale group .
.
.
(Lichtstrahlen, Bremer Bürger-Zeitung, the Braunschweig Volksfreund, Sozial-Demokrat (Stuttgart)), and also, although not quite consistently, some Rhenish press organs.
” The Braunschweig Volksfreund was Left-radical under Thalheimer’s editorship—now, however, with Wesemeyer as editor it “represents the standpoint of the Centre”.
The Bremer Bürger-Zeitung No.
74 (March 28) published (in the absence of Henke) a comment from the Braunschweig Volksfreund to the effect that that newspaper supported (atthat time) the attitude of the Internationale group (and regarded the “guiding theses of the ‘Spartacus letters’” as its “tactical and theoretical programme”).
.
.
“Hence the I.
S.
D.
and the Internationale group are not identical.
Both represent the radical Left and on tactical issues are strongly opposed to the Party Centre and the Social-Democratic Labour Commonwealth.
While, however, the I.
S.
D.
adopted this position from the outset, the Inter-nationale group has only gradually broken away from the opposition grouped around Ledebour-Haase.
At the time, the Bremer Bürger-Zeitung greeted this process as a further step towards clarification (No.
74, March 28).
.
.
.
Since then, in its ‘Spartacus letters’, the Internationale group has sharply and vigorously fought the Social-Demo-cratic Labour Commonwealth”.
(Quoted from the last ‘Spartacus letter’.
) “In this attitude to private property [the private property of the Social-Democratic Labour Common-wealth??], the I.
S.
D.
and the Internationale group, as already stated, are in full agreement, although N.
B.
they differ on many other issues.
” Both groups work “within the framework of the present organisation” “as long as this is not made impossible by the tyranny of the Party bureaucracy”.
.
.
.
All this is important (he writes), for people often make the mistake of “trying to erase the line of division between the Centre and radical Left”.
.
.
.
“How far the two groups will move towards separate organisational existence depends entirely on the development of inner-Party relations.
In any case, in the interests of clarity it is to be welcomed that they should be distinguished also externally, by their names.

Article: “B e t r a y a l of the Party I s B e t r a y a l o f t h e N a t i o n.
”“For several months now, n u m e r o u s anonymous l e a f l e t s have been making charges against the elected and well-tried leaders of the Party and trade unions in all manner of tones, including the use of the word ‘d o g ’.
The charge laid against them is that in the great crisis of world his-tory, the visible climax of which, for the Party’s policy, was August 4, 1914, they sold and betrayed the proletariat.
At first, this was dismissed with laughter.
But the more the terrible gravity of the war made itself felt in terms of casualties and the increasing scarcity of food, and the less prospect there was of peace, owing to the enemy’s persistent efforts to realise his plans of annihilation, more and more people were prepared to believe this insulting charge.
” “more and more” The use of the word “dog”—an obvious allusion to a leaflet which said that the social-imperialists ought to be treated with a “dog-whip”! “To what end people like Scheidemann, David and Lands-berg are supposed to have betrayed the proletariat, for what reward, has not been vouchsafed to us”.
.
.
.
Not for posts in the Party: “refusal to vote for war credits involves no danger to life”.
.
.
.
And wherein lies the betrayal is still less clear, for it is claimed that it follows from their convictions, their appraisal of the facts.
.
.
.
“In that case, the charge of betrayal has no meaning whatever.
” “But for the Party it is extremely danger-ous.
One can doubt and dispute as to what the Party membership thinks.
But there can be no doubt that today, too, at least three-quarters of those whom in the tran-quil time of peace the proletariat chose as leaders because of their services, still consider that voting for the war credits was correct and necessary.
Hence, over 90 of the 110 Social-Democrat Reichstag depu-N.
B.
cf.
Martov!! sic!! ties are supposed to have committed a betrayal on August 4, and over three-quarters of the leaders and Party function-aries are committing it even today.
If this were true, the most sensible thing would be to let the Party commit suicide and to encoffin and inter it as quickly as possible.
For if, after fifty years of organisational work, the proletariat has as its leaders men, practically all of whom are traitors, that would be overwhelming, irrefutable ||| proof that the proletariat is politically ||| quite incapable and will always be fooled.
||| What other conclusion could there be? One could sack all the old leaders and elect entirely new ones, but there would be no guarantee that in the next big crisis the new leaders would not once again commit treachery”.
.
.
.
For many extreme radicals were for August 4 (Pfannkuch, Ebert, etc.
).
.
.
.
“Consequently, what guar-antee could we give the workers that if these men are traitors, every one of their successors, too, would not finally end up as a traitor?” Now the anonymous leaflets have gone to the length of calling for a strike in the munitions industry.
That=high treason.
“It goes without saying that this idea of a mass strike will not have the slightest practical effect among the fanat-ically nationalist French or the haughty British”.

LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG 53 Leipziger Volkszeitung, July 10, 1916.
PARTY AFFAIRS “B e t r a y a l o f t h e P a r t y I s B e t r a y a l o f t h e N a t i o n” That is how the Chemnitz Volksstimme heads an article in which it reacts violently to the charge of Party betrayal levelled “in numer-ous anonymous leaflets against the elected and well-tried leaders of the Party and trade unions in all manner of tones, including the use of the word ‘dog’”.
This defence is followed by attack.
The second part of the article speaks of “high treason”.
It reads as follows: “Meanwhile, the anonymous leaflet literature has led to outright high treason.
We are not, of course, referring to Karl Liebknecht, whom a military tribunal, using legalistic deductions, is seeking to punish for attempted military betrayal, but whose behaviour at any rate has nothing whatever to do with high treason, as understood among the people.
We refer to acts of high treason that cannot be dis-counted by any twisting of words.
The Hamburger Echo reports that a leaflet now being distributed in working-class circles by unknown means calls for a general strike in the munitions industry.
* Under the slogan ‘Down with the War!’ it urges a ‘new mode of action’, and the examples it cites unmistakably show that this means a mass strike.
And so, while the enemy is attacking with the utmost fury, showering German soldiers with a hail of iron, they want to deprive the German artillery of shells; without its help the German infantry, the German proletarians in the army, are to be allowed to be slaugh-tered by enemy shells.
It goes without saying that this idea of a mass strike will not have the slightest practical effect among the fanati-cally nationalist French or the haughty British.
“This propaganda, therefore, is outright high treason, betrayal of our class comrades in the army, and we should like to know what our comrades at the front will say about such craziness.
“We are firmly convinced that the German working class, too, will give a fitting answer to these individuals who come before them with such claims.
The leaflets are, as we have said, anonymous; we do not know whether they have been put out by madmen or by Anglo-Russian stooges.
They certainly could not have been put out by Social-Democrats.
Anyone who allowed himself to support such propaganda, if only by passivity, would thereby forever cease to be part of the German Social-Democratic movement.
For this propaganda is devoid of honour and patriotism, and we cannot, of course, have anything in common with a person who sinks so low.
“But the mere possibility of such an occurrence is enough to show what this anonymous leaflet literature can lead to.
It began with * The italics here and below are the author’s.
—Ed.
the most foul invective, for which the authors did not dare to admit responsibility before their Party comrades, and has now sunk to this provocateur activity.
First there were cries of betrayal of the Party and now we have outright high treason! It is high time we got rid of it, once and for all.
Anyone who has anything to say should have the courage to speak out on his own responsibility.
Or perhaps, at a time when hundreds of thousands are sacrificing their lives for their cause, these people are too cowardly to risk being prosecuted.
In any case, anonymity will not protect the distributors of the anonymous leaflets; if they are caught they must, of course, expect the most severe punishment.
“The dangers of this anonymous propaganda have now become fully clear.
No distinction can be drawn between honest error and vile treason that is probably paid for with foreign money.
Party comrades are, therefore, warned to put a final stop to these anonymous leaflets.
They are a cloak for men who would plunge the German people, and above all the German proletariat, into calamity.
Be on guard against provocateurs!” We consider it necessary to reproduce these statements in order to show our readers what the Hamburger Echo and the Chemnitz Volksstimme regard as the task of the day.
If these two newspapers were to attack the distributors on the issues posed by the leaflets, that would be their legitimate right.
But if they raise an outcry against the propaganda as being high treason, that is a denunciation which deserves to be appraised by the working class at its true worth.
Moreover, as regards the issues involved, this accusation is completely unjustified, because, to the best of our knowledge, the leaflets suggest strike action only as a means of clearly expressing working-class demands on vital and pressing issues.
There is no mention whatever of the purpose the Hamburger Echo and the Chemnitz Volksstimme ascribe to them.

In the text, repeated mention of “ i m p e r i a l i s t plans”, etc.
Only 2 2 pages, 666-68, are devoted to the period after 1815: “Retrospect and Prospect”.
“Liberation wars also consummate the world-historical struggle for maritime and trade supremacy: the result— England’s mastery of the seas.
“But the era of revolution and wars of liberation signify also the beginning of new developments.
The revolution shattered the old feudal system of France and thereby gave an impulse to the transfor-mation of the social order and the state; it was only with the help of the peoples that the other European states were finally able to maintain themselves against the forces the revolution had brought to life in ||| France.
Of all the ideas of the revolution, none proved N.
B.
||| more effective, from the very outset, than the nation-||| al idea.
Under the oppression of cruel foreign rule and in heroic struggle against it, the other European peoples also became conscious of the inner connec-tion between state and nation.
In the eighteenth century the big states rose to defend the independenceof Europe and its equilibrium against the excessive power of a single state; now the peoples themselves have been rejuvenated and revitalised by the influx of new forces from the depths.
The national idea ||| becomes the crux and aim of almost all wars of the ||| N.
B.
||| nineteenth century.
“Naturally, the peoples’ increased consciousness of their strength was bound to make itself felt also in their own states.
The masses began to demand a share in the adminis-tration of the state.
“The French revolution, Napoleon’s world domination and the liberation wars made national feeling and the urge for political freedom invincible forces of recent history.
National tendencies were interwoven and fused with the liberal and democratic ideas born of the age of enlighten-ment to produce the theory of the sovereignty of the people.
According to this theory, statehood should be based on the undivided nation, and in such a way that the supreme will and supreme power are invested in the nation, and that only from its right is the right of the head of state derived” (667).
This theory threatened both the monarchies and their national composition; the Restoration was opposed to these ideas.
.
.
.
The nineteenth century as a whole, however, signified an advance towards political freedom and nationality.
“But that did not relegate to the background the compet-itive trade and political struggles, which have increasingly influenced the history of the nations ever since the epoch of early money economy and the great discoveries.
True, at first Britain enjoyed absolute trade supremacy, and using that power and the doctrine of free trade, she overcame the era of economic struggles which mercantilism had brought with it.
With the help of this doctrine which, like political liberalism, stems from the age of enlightenment, Britain conquered the world and won the battle for inter-national free trade and intercourse.
The economically weaker states submitted to this system for a time; even the youngest of the European national great powers—Italy and Germany—could not isolate themselves from the new doc-trine.
“Then, however, the United States of America, after overcoming a severe inter-nal crisis, emerged as a new, powerful competitor in the trade and political || arena.
A new era of economic struggles || has begun, in which there has been a || return to the policy of safeguarding || national labour by protective tariffs and trade treaties, but without lapsing into the crude mercantilist policy of | force.
In this the United States has || | been followed by the French Third Repub-|| | lic and, since 1880, by the new German || Empire as well.
With the conclusion || of the struggles for liberal and national || state systems, and with the structure || of the constitutional state completed, || efforts are made to assure maximum ha-ha!! || scope for the enhanced power of the || nation.
In the colonial race, the Great || || Powers seek to acquire territories as || N.

Their incessant || diplomatic activity aims at opening up new trade areas for their industrious peoples.
These expansion efforts, how-ever, are accompanied by a growing urge || for economic autarchy.
Britain wants || to form, with her colonial possessions, || a uniform closed trading area, a Greater || Britain.
America strives for economic self-sufficiency, she wants to make herself independent of the Old World in regard ||| to trade and industry.

||| trade, in the proper sense of the word, | has only just begun.
It is leading to the rise of s e v e r a l world empires “imperialism” existing side by side, and their policy , if indeed they want to maintain them-selves, must be imperialism.
“The name and concept of the n e w “new i m p e r i a l i s m are derived neither imperialism” from the Roman Empire nor from the medieval empire and Papacy; it is no longer a question of the world rule of a single power.
Colonial expansion, par-||| ticipation in world trade, protection |||| ||| of overseas interests by means of power-|||| “c h a r a c -||| ful navies—these, from the example |||| teristic ||| of the British Empire, have become the |||| f e a t u r e s ” characteristic features of modern world powers.

There can be no question of the colonies being monopolised for Britain” .

(the same as Britain—is flatly untrue: railways, concessions, export of capital.
Germany has outstripped Brit-ain in spite of the latter’s colonies.
Without colonies, Britain would probably be still more behindhand.
That, in the first place.
And, in the second place, finance capital in Britain has to a greater extent “rested on its laurels”.
Now German finance capital, too, wants to do so).
“The distinguishing feature of imperial-ist policy is that it seeks to settle pro-blems of economic competition by the exercise of state power in the interests of the capitalist stratum controlling the state.
By protective tariff walls it ensures exploi-tation of the home market for its cartels.
By its policy of colonies and spheres of influence it seeks to reserve parts of the world market as a monopoly for its capi-talist class, and by economic and political means of compulsion it seeks to convert smaller countries into spheres of exploita-tion for its capital.
That brings it into ever-increasing contradiction with the impe-rialist policy of other states.
Hence, the striving to increase state power, the inten-sified armaments race on land and sea.
It was this policy that led to the catastrophe.

— We must first of all take power in our o w n hands and not talk vainly about “power”.
“It is not a question of merely regulating trade relations, but of the power policy that seeks to secure a monopoly position for one’s own capital at the expense of others, the policy from which the danger of war arose.
That was the situation before the war.
But does that mean that we are to be reconciled to it and not oppose by every means the continuation of this policy, and at a much higher level? We are of the contrary opinion: because we have seen what this monopolist power policy leads to, we must oppose its continuation and extension by every means” (61).

But war threatens catastrophe: “However, the catas-trophe that leads to the most complete collapse is defeat in a frivolous war” (371).
The proletariat is “today hardly anywhere strong enough” to make war impossible before its outbreak by means of revolution (and a soldiers’ strike is revolution).
“But in all capitalist countries it is already strong enough to ensure that every fruitless war entailing great losses be made the starting point of a revolution which establishes a proletarian regime” (371).

“The socialist community will never be able to include whole nations within its make-up by force.
Imagine the masses of the people, enjoying all the blessings of their national culture, taking a full and active part in legislation and administration, and, finally, supplied with arms—would it be possible to subordinate such a nation to the rule of an alien social organism by force? All state power rests on the force of arms.
The present-day people’s army, thanks to its ingenious mechanism, still constitutes a tool in the hands of a definite person, family or class, exactly like the knightly or mercenary army of the past.
The army of the democratic community of a socialist society is nothing but the people armed, since it consists of highly cultured persons, working without compulsion in socialised workshops and taking full part N.
B.
in all spheres of political life.
Under such such conditions, any possibility of rule by a foreign conditions nation disappears” (534).
A United States of Europe is “not an empty dream”, but the “inevitable end of the road on which the nations set foot long ago” (542).
If a socialist Germany wanted to send part of her work people to the Ukraine, she would not do so “without guar-anteeing them their cultural independence” (543) .
.
.
(the end of §30).
In § 9: “ Imperialism and the Nationality Principle ” (512-29 of the Russian translation), the author quotes Schulze-Gaevernitz on British imperialism, points to the disintegration of Turkey, to Italy’s attempt to seize Alba-nia: “Allusions will be made to Trento and Trieste, while having Albania in mind” (519).
“In this way a predatory imperialist war can be presented to the mass of the Italian nation as a war for national freedom” (519).

Baghdad, Russia in Persia, etc.
—“such are the seeds and elements of those future conflicts” (518).

In the same way “British imperialism unfolds | before the mass of voters a seductive picture of an | empire of 400 million people under the rule of the | single British nation, while having in mind the | monopoly profits of the iron and steel magnates and | speculation on the London Stock Exchange”.

“At some time Russian imperialism will probably pro-| claim the freedom and unity of Poland and the | Ukraine in order to open new markets to the St.

“The destruction of Austria within capitalist society can only be the work of imperialism” (528).
.

“The disintegration of Austria presupposes the triumph of imperialism in Germany, Russia and Italy.

In connection with the shipping subsidy (after the repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law), “the split will probably come and can then only be useful.

Aim—to set out “the main ideas of the three contending groups” (770):.

“The majority, the Labour Commonwealth, and the Inter-nationale (Liebknecht’s group)” (771).
.

1—wants “a German victory” 2—“an undecisive end to the war” 3—“a German defeat” (771).
.
.
.
“The first two trends stand for defence of the N.
B.
fatherland, although the Labour Commonwealth stresses its great anxiety that the limits of pure defence should not be exceeded, whereas the adher-ents of the ‘Third International’ reject the principle of ‘fatherland defence’ as a misleading phrase” (771).
.
.
.
“The Liebknecht group has remained quite true to itself.
.
.
.
This trend has now consolidated itself in a new party and adopted the Spartacus programme.
Following its theoretical leader, the Russian Lenin, it wants to make it obligatory for all Social-Democratic parties, by virtue of their inter-national duty, to employ every available means for the defeat of their own country: illegal leaflets, secret organi-sations, mass strikes and insurrections” (771).
.
.
.
“In Russia, the adherents of this trend honestly and without embarrass-ment call themselves defeatists” (722).
“The Spartacus propaganda, which maintains that an enemy invasion is by no means the worst of all horrors, but, on the contrary, might lead to the achievement of freedom, probably has its strongest support among the Russian emigre theoreticians in Switzerland; it can have practical importance only for Germany, and is therefore propaganda for a German defeat” (772).
.
.
.
“The Labour Commonwealth or Zimmerwald Right, whose theoretician is Kautsky and whose political leaders are Haase and Ledebour, not only deduces from the actual situation that this war is bound to end without victors or vanquished, but also desires such an outcome of the great struggle.
” N.

“Criticism of this half-way position is extremely easy and simple.
The assertion that the task of Germany’s defence has been solved is so obviously contrary to the facts that it can only arouse laughter among intelligent people” (773).

.
“It (the majority) is working for the speediest N.
B.
possible peace, which, however, can only be brought about by the present governments” (778).
“The idea of a catastrophe or revolution as a means of building a socialist society should be discarded once and for all, and not from a particular day, but as a matter of principle.
To be a socialist means N.
B.
being in principle an anti-revolutionary ” (author’s heavy type); “the opposite conception is merely a carry-over from the emancipatory struggle of the bourgeoisie, from which we have not yet completely ha-freed our minds” (780).

“In the final analysis, therefore, the crisis of the August 4 policy is but a renewal of the old struggle between the cataclysmal and evolution theories, which now, with the victory of evolutionary views, is drawing to a close.
Hence, in spite of a dozen or so deserters from one side or the other, we again see the old battle lines of reformists and revolu-tionaries, or, if you like, revisionists and radicals, ranged against each other; and we hear the old slogans” (784).
.

“Though denounced a hundred times, the evolu-tionary-historical point of view has been steadily gaining ground in the Party, and it will triumph, N.
B.
even if after the war the indignation of the peoples that have suffered from it leads here and there to revolutionary outbreaks.

the hub here is in the first half of the sentence“Socialism is being increasingly realised from day to day because of the growing number of people who do not make their living from private economic activity, or receive wages or salaries from private hands.
The worker in a state, municipal or co-opera-tive enterprise is socialised just as is the health-insurance doctor or trade union official” (784).

Only a minority of the workers take part in the labour movement.
“Consequently, living standards || have risen only slightly, and only among the upper || sections of the working class.
The mass of the workers remain a prey to want, care and privation.
That is why doubts arise from time to time about the path we have chosen.
The critics seek new paths, relying || chiefly on more vigorous action as the earnest of success.
Attempts are made along these lines, but they usually end in failure, and then there is a return to the old tactics, pursued with greater force.
These fluctuations are apparent to anyone who studies the workers’ movement for a more or less lengthy period.

38 6, Berne September 16, 1916), a correspondent (([J.
H.

The sharpest combating of militarism and rejection of fatherland defence—today, and disarmament, together with social-ism—tomorrow.
” ( ** ) the article of this J.
H.
Basle is very good, it is purely working-class and revolutionary-internationalist “The editor Comrade Schneeberger (in an ‘Editorial Postscript’) remarks that the trade unions as such should not concern themselves either with armaments reduction or disarmament.
The fact that a man is a trade union member does not make him either a Social-Democrat or an anti-militarist; his political or religious views, as such, have nothing to do with his trade union member-ship.
True, in most cases the trade unionist soon becomes !! an adherent of socialist or Social-Democratic views.
However, he expresses these views not so much in the trade union as in the Social-Democratic organisations set up for this type of activity.
This method has proved a very rational one and should therefore continue, all the more so that the trade unions have big enough tasks in the economic sphere.
“Moreover, the trade unions and trade union bodies are not in a position to carry out any real educational work in this field.
“Generalities, of which there is no shortage in the above-mentioned article, will not help.
They are of as little use in convincing a person who—as is usually the case—has grown up with quite different views, as, say, in explaining the issues of the war in three sentences, or in making an impression on an impartial and unprejudiced reader by exaggerating the role of the Swiss armed forces in labour conflicts.
One has only to consider the workers’ struggles in Italy, Spain, France and Germany, even in free America, to realise that Swiss conditions are still preferable to the Russian.
“And the catchword ‘The worker has no father-|| | land’ is absolutely uncalled for at a time when || || | | | N.
B.
| | | | | | 9 || the overwhelming majority of Europe’s workers || | | have for two years now been fighting the ‘enemies’ of their countries side by side with their bourgeoi-| | sies, and those left at home are determined to || ‘hold out’ in spite of want and hardship.
In the || event of a foreign attack, we would certainly || see the same spectacle in Switzerland.
Here, too, || those who are now indulging in the loudest tirades || will, perhaps, be the first to abandon their posi-|| tions.

He is against “isolating” the trade unions, “restricting” them to “purely trade union questions”.
The author defends the opposite view in 32 half-columns: we cannot do everything; there is more than enough to do already (lists of r e f o r m-i s t issues!!); we have had six articles on imperialism, and from the Social-Democratic standpoint; in 1904, Schneeberger, representative of the Central Committee of the Metalworkers’ Union in Lucerne, was opposed to “throwing our-selves (as a trade union) into political activity”, and he received 56 votes to 18 at the Lucerne trade union congress; and “instead of planned [p.

“ There is Saint-Simon’s well-known assertion, on account of which a court charge was brought against him, that the loss France would suffer by the sudden || death of a thousand of her highest officials or the members || of the royal family would be infinitely smaller than that || which would be caused by the death of a thousand of || her best workers” (p.

(The book is dated March 1914) (p.
317) “In the Balkans it is likely enough that Austria, backed by-the preponderant influence of the Triple Alliance, would have availed herself of one of the several crises which have followed the young Turkish revolution, to force her way to Salonica and to annex a part at least of Macedonia.

“Europe had a long experience of German ‘hegemony’ during the quarter of a century which elapsed between the fall of the French Empire and the creation of the Franco-Russian Alliance.
Nothing disastrous happened.
No little states were over-run, no neighbour’s landmarks removed, no thrones overturned, no national or religious liberties menaced” (p.
34).
“In Europe the epoch of conquest is over, and save in the Balkans and perhaps on the fringes of the Austrian and Russian Empires, it is as certain as anything in politics can be, that the frontiers of our modern national states are finally drawn.
My own belief is that there will be no more wars among the six Great Powers” (p.
35).
“The present territorial arrangement of Europe follows with few exceptions the lines of nationality” (p.
35).
“Shall the Germans dig for iron ore on the slopes of the Atlas, and carry it in the form of steel rails to Baghdad? That is the typical question of modern diplomacy, and sanely regarded, it is a good deal more important than the typical question of the old world, whether the King of Spain should be a Bourbon or a Habsburg.
To settle this question, and similar questions which belong to the same order, the young men of Europe are drilled, the battleships are built and the taxes squandered.
Nothing is at stake which can affect the fortunes or ownership of a single acre of European soil.
Nothing would be changed in the politics or religion or public life of any European state if these questions were settled otherwise or were not settled at all” (p.
36).
“But who in England would have cared if the iron ore of Morocco had gone to cast German cannon at Essen, instead of French cannon at Creusot?” (p.
36).
“The Entente Cordiale between Britain and France, which marked the beginning of the tension with Germany, was based, so far as the world knows, upon a single docu-ment, which was nothing but a business-like adjustment of French and British interests in Egypt and Morocco” (p.
37).
“A German firm, the Mannesmann Brothers, could indeed boast that it had obtained an exclusive concession to work all the mines of Morocco in return for money which it had lent to an embarrassed Sultan during its civil wars.
That this was the real issue is proved by the terms which were more than once discussed between Paris and Berlin for the settlement of the dispute.
A ‘détente’ or provisional settle-ment of the dispute was concluded in 1910, which had only one clause—that German finance should share with French finance in the various undertakings and companies which aimed at ‘opening up’ Morocco by ports, railways, mines, and other public works.
No effect was ever given to this undertaking, and German irritation at the delays of French diplomacy and French finance culminated in the dispatch of the gunboat Panther to Agadir as a prelude to further ‘conversations’.
Had M.
Caillaux remained in power, we know from the subsequent investigations before the Senate’s Committee, how those conversations would have ended.
He would have effected not merely an adjustmentof French and German colonial interests, but a general understanding which would have covered the whole field of Franco-German relations.
The points on which he had begun to negotiate were all economic, and chief among them was a proposal to put an end to the boycott by French finance of the Baghdad railway, and to admit German secur-ities to quotation on the Paris Exchange.
The alarm which this bold step by M.
Caillaux caused both to French patriots and to British imperialists is not yet forgotten, and its echo was heard both in London and Paris, when, towards the close of 1913, M.
Caillaux returned to office.
In those informal negotiations he had made the beginnings of a read-justment in Franco-German relations which would have transformed not merely French but European politics, if he had been Premier for a few months longer.
French patriots took alarm and feared that he was about to rob them of their dream of a revenge for 1870.
British imperialists in our Conservative press assailed him from a fear that if France composed her quarrel with Germany, this country would be left isolated.
In a single sentence in the debate (Novem-ber 27, 1911) which followed this Agadir crisis, Sir Edward Grey used a phrase which showed that our diplomacy had shared the fears of our Conservative press.
There was a risk, as he put it, that France might be drawn into the orbit of German diplomacy.
It was for that reason, and not because it really concerned us how much or how little compensation France paid to Germany in the Congo for her seizure of Morocco, that we were ready to back the less conciliatory diplomacy of M.
Caillaux’s successors, if need be, by force of arms.
This was, perhaps, the most instructive incident in the recent history of European diplomacy” (pp.
38-40).
“The French Périer Bank the other day lent a million pounds to the Turkish Government, which it used to pay the first instalment of the purchase price of a dreadnought cruiser built in Newcastle.
A few days later it was announced that the same bank, obviously as a part of its commission, had obtained a concession for a railway from Smyrna to the Dardanelles.
While we must admit that the export of capital could not be carried out without some movement of goods, there is still a sharp distinction to be made be-tween the financier’s transaction and simple exchange ofgoods from the standpoint of the sociology of class.
Com-merce carried on upon an elaborate structure of credit is more profitable to the investing classes than the simpler exchanges which lake place between nations on an equal level of economic development.
If we send Welsh coal to France, and receive artificial flowers in exchange, capital makes two profits—the English colliery owner’s profit, and the French sweater’s profit.
But if we lend money to the Argentine, and with it she buys rails here, and afterwards sends out meat to be sold here so that the interest on the loan may be paid, then capital has made three profits—the English steel trade’s profit, the Argentine meat trade’s profit and the English banker’s and investor’s profit.
It is this third profit which our leisured class chiefly values, and to develop the sort of commerce which requires this credit basis, that is to say, commerce with weaker debtor nations, is the object of imperialism” (pp.
73-74).
“Mr.
Mulhall calculated for the Dictionary of Political Economy that our foreign and colonial investments grew between 1882 and 1893 at the prodigious rate of 74 per cent per annum.
But the decisive evidence is supplied by Sir Robert Giffen.
Taking the year 1899, he reckoned that the profits on all our external trade in goods, both foreign and colonial, amounted only to 18 millions sterling.
The profit on foreign and colonial investments in the same year he puts at between 90 and 100 millions sterling” (p.
77).
“Ten years later, as Sir George Paish stated in a paper which he read to the Royal Statistical Society, our profits from foreign and colonial investments amounted to 140 mil-lions” (pp.

“Behind them * are the embassies, and behind the embas-sies are the fleets of all Europe, which would steam at a few hours’ notice to Turkish waters, if there were any delay or hesitation in paying over the revenues mortgaged to European railway companies or to the holders of Turkish bonds.
Diplomacy and armaments are, in a word, employed to enforce the unconscionable and usurious bargains which Baron Hirsch and his imitators have struck, by means of bribery with Turkish Ministers whose hands no honourable man would condescend to shake” (p.
85).

89, footnote).
“It is a prosperous concern.
In the present century Armstrongs has never paid less than 10 per cent, and its dividend often rises to 15 per cent.
The great French works at Creusot (Messrs.
Schneider) have paid as much as 20 per cent.
The building and equip-ment of a dreadnought must mean at least a quarter N.
B.
of a million in profits to the firm which secures the contract.
Such a stake is worth an effort, and these firms are well equipped for the exercise of political and social pressure.
The share-list of Armstrongs alone includes the names of sixty noblemen or their wives, sons or daughters, fifteen baronets, twenty knights, eight Members of Parliament, five bishops, twenty military and naval officers, and eight journal-ists.
Among those interested in these firms there were last summer two Liberal Cabinet Ministers, a law officer of the Crown and two members of the Opposition Front Bench.
There is an amusing corres-pondence between these share-lists and the member-ship rolls of the Navy League and the National Service League” (p.
90).
“The true facts were stated at the time by Admiral von Tirpitz in the Reichstag and also by the head of the Krupp firm.
Parliament preferred to believe Mr.
Mulliner.
Theresult was that Mr.
McKenna calculated that Germany would have seventeen dreadnoughts at ‘the danger-point’, March 1912, and revised his own programme accordingly.
Mr.
Balfour even predicted for Germany twenty-one or twenty-five capital ships.
The event showed that Admiral von Tirpitz had told the truth: when the time came Germany had nine.
The scare cost us the price of the four ‘contingent’ dreadnoughts, a measurable quantity, while it added to Europe’s stores of bitterness and mistrust what no figures can reckon” (p.
91).
“The international relations of the firms which trade in armaments offer a tempting field for satire.
The inevitable comment lies on the surface of the facts, and they shall be baldly set down here.
Capital has no patriotism.
A leading German firm turns out to be conducted by French directors.
German firms are rebuilding the rival Russian navy.
Brit-ish firms have branches in Italy which are building those Italian dreadnoughts that are represented as rivals to our own.
The Nobel Trust and till lately the Harvey Company were formed of all the leading armaments firms, British, French, German or American.
At one time the French firm of Schneider and the German firm of Krupp united in a syndicate to develop the iron ore fields of Ouenza in Algeria” (p.
92).
“All over the world these forces, concentrated, resolute and intelligent, are ceaselessly at work to defeat the more diffused and less easily directed forces which make for disarmament and peace.
The number of persons who have anything to gain by armaments and war is relatively small, when measured against the whole population of the civilised world.
But their individual stake is larger, and they work in alliance with Society, which regards Empire as a field for the careers of its sons, and with finance which treats it as a field for investment” (p.
93).
“Mr.
Gladstone had come into power after the Midlothian campaign with a programme of resolute opposition to impe-rialism.
The chief act of his administration abroad was the occupation of Egypt.
Henceforward Liberalism had a lie in its soul” (pp.

“Under such influences Liberalism became an imperialist party, with Lord Rosebery, and, later, Sir Edward Grey as the only possible directors of its foreign policy.
LordRosebery belonged by marriage to the Rothschild family, and it was the Rothschild influence which brought about the occupation of Egypt” (p.
105).
“There would have been no breach with France, and the Entente Cordiale might have been established some twenty years earlier.
European armaments would have been less crushing, and Bismarckian diplomacy less triumphant.
Above all, the alliance would never have been concluded which filled the treasury of the Russian autocrat with French gold, and so perpetuated the cruellest of European despotisms” (p.
108).
“‘The following public works were commenced or complet-ed during 1907 at Coomassie:—Post Office, female prison, hospital and dispensary, European hospital, laundry in which to wash Europeans’ clothes, and several buildings for the Gold Coast Regiments.

Gold mines, prisons, barracks, a laun-dry for Europeans built with public money, and a golf course, these are our works of civilisation.
But there is no school ” (p.

“In other words, whichever party is in power, the Foreign Secretary will always be an imperialist, a personality whom The Times, the City and the Conservative Party can unre-servedly trust.
A Radical can no more become Foreign Secre-tary than a Roman Catholic can become Lord Chancellor.
The doctrine of ‘continuity’ means that foreign affairs have in effect been removed from the sphere of party government, and are now influenced only by the opinions of the governing class, of those, that is to say, who move at court and in society, who regard the army and the civil service as careers reserved for their families, and survey the world beyond these islands mainly as a field for the investment of their surplus wealth” (p.

“Still more important is the impotence of the House of Commons in regard to treaties.
Unless they include financial provisions, there is no obligation to submit them to Parlia-ment, and no discussion can take place upon them until they are already signed, ratified, and published to the world.
One consequence of this is that a secret treaty is for us no less binding than a public instrument.
A secrettreaty duly signed and ratified by one British Government would bind its successors.
In theory the King and his Foreign Minister, acting with the consent of his colleagues in the Cabinet, can and do contract the most solemn and vital obligations in the name of the forty millions over whom they rule in these islands, without consulting their elected representatives” (pp.

“It is frankly admitted in these letters that Lord John Russell, the Prime Minister, was quite unable to control Palmerston, who constantly acted in large issues without the authority either of the whole Cabinet or even of his chief.
He even went so far as to recognise Louis Napoleon after the coup d’état entirely on his own responsibility, and against the wishes, not only of public opinion, but of the Queen and his own colleagues.
To the suggestion that he should be dismissed, Lord John Russell always answered that if he were dismissed he would avenge himself by going into Opposition and overthrowing the Government.
How just this fear was, events showed.
He was eventually forced to resign at the end of December 1851.
By February 1852 he had unseated his late colleagues.
A Cabinet which cannot dispense with a Minister must be prepared to give him a free hand” (pp.

“On the other hand, the world in which she * moved was a world of monarchs and governments.

B.
ing then in process of negotiation.
The services of finance and diplomacy are mutual, and in the modern world they have become indispensable to each other.
It is an immense reinforcement to diplomacy in dealing with a debtor state to know that it has, in effect, behind it the exportable capital of a wealthy nation to give or to withhold.
If any power or group of powers held the monopoly of the world’s money-market even for a few years, and used it with a conscious political purpose, they would in the end dictate to Russia, China, Turkey, and the Latin American Republics” (p.
221).
“Russia is sensitive because she depends as absolutely as any Latin American Republic upon her repute in Western markets.
She must float by far the greater part of her loans abroad.
She cannot even provide from her own resources for the municipal enterprise of her cities.
Her undeveloped coal and iron and petroleum fields all await the fertilisation of foreign capital.
If we can conceive for a moment what German opinion would mean to us, if we had to float Con-sols through the Deutsche Bank, if Manchester had to goto Berlin for money to build her tramways, if a South Wales coal mine were awaiting the good opinion of some financier in Hamburg, we shall be able to realise dimly why and how much the good opinion of the English people matters to the Russian Government.
Credit is a delicate possession.
So long as British investors thought of Russia either as a hostile empire dangerous to ourselves, or as an unstable autocracy menaced by revolution, it was in vain that the Russian financier brought his proposals to the City.
Pru-dence, patriotism and humanity were all against him.
The change in the opinions of the moneyed classes began when the Conservative press advocated a rapprochement, when The Times ceased to give prominence to news damaging to the autocracy, and when it was known that an agreement over Persia was in process of arrangement.
There was no mystery about the reasons for this change of attitude.
Sir Edward Grey had said that it was necessary to restore Russia to her rank as a Great Power in order to redress the balance in Europe.
In plain words, our diplomacy wanted Russian support against Germany, and France was urging and engineering the reconciliation.
The early months of 1906 were the critical moment for Russian finance, and it happened to coincide with the critical moment in the development of her Constitution.
While she was endeavouring to secure a loan of one hundred millions in Western Europe, the elections for the First Duma were about to be held.
The Constitution was still a sheet of paper.
Everything turned on the ability of the Duma to assert itself, to control the bureaucracy, to make itself the supreme power in Russia.
There was one obvious method open to it.
It must possess control of the purse, and that meant at the moment control over this foreign loan.
If the loan were concluded before it met, the bureaucracy would meet it with its war-chest full.
For a few months or weeks European public opinion was potentially the master of Russia’s destinies.
It pro-fessed full sympathy with the constitutional movement, and it had the means of giving its sympathy effect.
The Russian Liberals (Cadets) were at one with the Socialists in urging that the granting of the loan should be made conditional on the consent of the Duma.
This would have involved a delay of two or three months, but it would haveenabled the Parliamentary majority to drive its bargain with a Tsar who had already repented his concessions.
Fresh from their sweeping victories at the polls, the Liber-als and Socialists might have said to the Tsar’s Ministers: ‘We have Russia behind us, and we have Europe behind us.
Your coffers are empty; your credit is exhausted.
Concede our full rights of responsible government, and we will vote your taxes and sanction your loan.
Deny our rights, and we are convinced that neither in London nor in Paris will you find the money to finance your oppressions.
’ But the great loan had already been floated in Paris and London by March 1906, and in May when the Duma assembled, it found itself confronted by a Government which had nothing to fear from Russia, and nothing more to hope from Europe.
Europe had enabled it to pay its Cossacks.
For two genera-tions we closed our money-market to the Tsars.
We opened it three months too soon.
Had we waited those three months, as the Russian Liberal press implored us to wait, the pro-gressive parties must have triumphed.
The Cossack can do little, unless the financier stands behind him.
But no Par-liament can effectively wield the traditional weapon of supply, if foreign banks have first provided for the despot’s needs.
The decision, in this instance, rested with London.
The Paris banks, weary of the burden of supporting the tottering Russian chaos, had made it a condition of their supporting this loan, that English banks should share the profitable burden.
It lay with the English banks on their side to insist on the brief delay required to obtain the Duma’s assent.
It may be said that ‘business is business’; one cannot fairly expect a banker, when he is offered a large commission for floating a loan, to weigh all the consequences which his action will have for the liberties of a foreign nation” (pp.
225-28).
“With all our buying, we never bought Russian loyalty, nor prevented her from coquetting with the German rival.
Yet the cards were all in our hands.
Whatever else Germany can do for Russia, she cannot lend her money.
Had we made terms before we lent, had we even checked the flow of gold, we could have won some measure of control over Russian policy.
If France had backed us (and we were earning her backing during the Moroccan crisis), it ought to have beenpossible to say to Russia: ‘No more money until Persia is evacuated.
’ Persia, after all, is a luxury for Russia; money is a necessity” (p.
229).
“Europe made or pretended to make some futile efforts to prevent the outbreak of the Balkan wars.
They failed because they were insincere.
Russia, as we now know, so far from wishing to prevent the war, had actually arranged it by presiding over the formation of the Balkan League.
At the very moment when she joined the concert in declaring that none of the Allies would be allowed to keep the terri-tory they won, she had set her seal to a treaty of partition, and accepted the post of arbiter in the division of the terri-tory.
It is such duplicity which makes concerts ineffective.
Either of these wars could have been prevented, if the French banks had been forbidden to finance the combatants.
They were not forbidden because Russia willed it otherwise” (pp.
230-31).
“The system known as peonage is, on the other hand, general throughout Latin America, and the capital by which it is worked is often foreign and sometimes British.
It is the rule in Mexico and Brazil, and probably in all the more backward Republics of South America.
The victim, usually a native, but sometimes a white or a half-breed, incurs a debt to the planter or merchant, and by the Latin Amer-ican law of debtor and creditor, which knows no Truck Acts, * becomes in effect his slave until the debt is paid off.
It never is paid off; the planter keeps the books.
Under this transparent fiction of debt, slaves are bought and sold, villages broken up, peasant landowners reduced to the level of serfs, and tribes carried off to distant scenes of oppression.
Children are bought and sold, and young women driven into commercial prostitution.
All of this is a typical expression of Latin American civilisation.
But foreign capital venturing into these regions adapts itself to its environment, and does in Mexico as the Mexicans do.
It turns the rather slovenly, inefficient oppressions of the lazy Spanish landowner into a competent and extensive system, conducted with a ruthlessness and on a scale which transcend the habits of the country.
The spectacle is not * Payment of wages in kind .
—Ed .
one which a European democracy ought to watch with in-different eyes and folded arms.
If the people of Mexico or Brazil developed a capitalistic system of their own, then however gross its evils might be, the process ought clearly to be allowed to follow its own natural evolution.
For purely Mexican wrongs, the Mexicans themselves must find the remedy.
But the European financier goes forth equipped.
with resources taken from our stores on a career of conquest and exploitation, protected by our flag and backed by our prestige” (pp.
236-37).
“The debatable area, where recognition 76 might either be granted or refused, would still be considerable, and would include Russia, Turkey, China, Persia, the Portuguese colonies, and most of Latin America” (pp.
242-43).
“If we were to take the sum by which British and German armaments have increased in the present century, it would be possible to allocate the increase, roughly, somewhat as follows: 50 per cent or less for the settlement of the question, Who shall exploit Morocco?; 25 per cent or more for the privilege of building a railway to Baghdad and beyond it; 25 per cent or more for the future eventualities which remain unsettled—the fate of the Portuguese colonies in Africa, and the destinies of China.
In the second place, the delimi-tation of spheres of interest is almost inevitably fatal to the national existence of the country partitioned, and as inevitably adds a vast burden to the commitments of the imperial power.
Persia furnishes the obvious illustration.
Sir Edward Grey is clearly resolved that he will not allow himself by the march of events to be drawn into the assump-tion of any direct responsibility for the administration of the British sphere.
It is a laudable resolve, but Russia may at any moment frustrate it” (pp.
246-47).
“Our own claim to the lion’s share, the Yangtze Valley, is admitted by no other power, and it is doubtful whether the Foreign Office still maintains it” (p.
248).
“It is the interest of the whole class which exports capital abroad.
But it would be folly to ignore or minimise the direct interest of the trade.
It is an interest which happens to be firmly entrenched in political circles, and as the exploit of Mr.
Mulliner shows, it is a singularly alert and energetic interest.
If public life continues to develop on the presentlines, the great scandal of tomorrow will be a discovery that the Liberal Party funds have been invested not in Marconis, but in Krupps” (pp.
267-68).
“What a monstrous theory it is that Britain and Russia, simply because they have considerable material interests, political, strategic and mercantile, in Persia, should have the right to dispose of the destinies of its people” (p.
290).
“It would, of course, be folly to suppose that the accept-ance of this principle of the supremacy of the Concert [of the Great Powers] would at once create harmony, and bring about a reduction of armaments.
But it would at once achieve this—it would make a standard for the con-science of the civilised world, it would provide an objective test by which the loyalty of any policy might be tried, and above all it would supply a common ground on which all the parties of peace might take their stand.
It would conduce to a gradual slackening of the European tension, a gradual loosening of the existing alliances, and in time create an atmosphere in which a proposal for the reduction of arma-ments, and eventually some scheme for the creation of a loose Federal Council to decide the common affairs of Europe might at least be considered” (p.
293).
“On the plane of class-egoism, armaments are for the capitalist class entirely rational; the competition to accu-mulate them has an adequate motive, and the struggle for a balance of power is seen to be a phase and expression of modern finance” (p.
310).
“Men are reluctant to allow that the concerns which divide states are at bottom petty and sordid.
We dignify them with great abstract words; we invoke the memories of heroic times.
We play with the legendary inheritance of the balance of power, until we persuade ourselves that our homes are in danger, and our faiths and liberties at stake.
These are the terrors of an older world, as insubstantial today as the ghosts of Marlborough and Wellington.
The powers struggle today over nothing vital, nothing homely, nothing relevant to our daily life.
A romantic sentimental-ism in the masses plays into the hands of a shrewd realism in the ruling class” (pp.
315-16).

“I consider Mazzini’s policy fundamentally wrong.
He is working entirely in the interests of Austria by inciting Italy to a breach now.
On the other hand, he fails to appeal to the peasants, that part of Italy that has been oppressed for centuries, and thus prepares new resources for the count-er-revolution.
Signor Mazzini knows only the cities with their liberal nobility and ‘enlightened citizens’.
The mate-rial needs of the Italian rural population—sucked dry and systematically enfeebled and besotted like the Irish—are, of course, too low for the heaven-in-words of his cosmo-politan-neo-Catholic-ideological manifestoes.
But it would have required courage, to be sure, to tell the bourgeoisie and the nobility that the first step towards the independence of Italy is the complete emancipation of the peasants and the transformation of their share-cropping system into freebourgeois property.
Mazzini seems to think that a loan of ten million francs is more revolutionary t h a n w i n -n i n g o v e r t e n m i l l i o n h u m a n b e i n g s.
I am very much afraid that if worse comes to worst the Austrian Government will itself change the system of landownership in Italy and reform it in the ‘Galician’ manner” (pp.

78 “And now as to myself, no credit is due to me for discovering the existence of classes in modern society or the s t r u g g l e between them.
Long before me b o u r g e o i s historians had described the histor-ical development of this class struggle and bourgeois economists the economic anatomy of the classes.
What I d i d t h a t w a s n e w was to prove: (1) that the exist-ence of classes is only bound up with particular histo-rical phases in the development of production, (2) that the class struggle necessarily l e a d s t o t h e d i c -tatorship of the p r o l e t a r i a t , (3) that this dictatorship i t s e l f o n l y constitutes T H E T R A N S I T I O N T O T H E A B O L I T I O N O F A L L C L A S S E S and to a classless society.
* Ignorant louts like Heinzen, who deny not merely the class struggle but even the existence of classes, only prove that, despite all their blood curdling yelps and the humanitarian airs they give themselves, they regard the social conditions under which the bourgeoisie rules as the final product, the non plus ultra of history, and that they are only the servitors of the bourgeoisie.
And the less these louts realise the greatness and transient necessity of the bourgeois regime itself the more disgusting is their servitude” (pp.
164-65).

I shall give you here only quite briefly the decisive points.

“Ireland is the bulwark of the English landed aris-tocracy.
The exploitation of that country is not only one of the main sources of this aristocracy’s material welfare; it is its greatest m o r a l strength.
It, in fact, represents the domination of England over Ireland.
Ireland is therefore the great means by which the English aristocracy maintains its domination in England herself.
“If, on the other hand, the English army and police were to withdraw from Ireland tomorrow, you would at once have an agrarian revolution there.
But the overthrow of the English aristocracy in Ireland involves as a nec-essary consequence i t s o v e r t h r o w i n E n g l a n d.
And this would fulfil the preliminary condition for the proletarian r e v o l u t i o n in England.
The destruction of the English landed aristocracy in Ireland is an i n f i n i t e l y e a s i e r operation than in England herself, because in Ireland the land question has hitherto been the exclusive form of the social question, because it is a question of existence, of life and death, for the immense majority of the Irish people, and because it is at the same time inseparable f r o m t h e n a t i o n a l q u e s t i o n .
This quite apart from the Irish being more passionate and r e v o -l u t i o n a r y i n c h a r a c t e r than the English.
“As for the English bourgeoisie, it has in the first place a common interest with the English aristocracy in turning Ireland into mere pasture land which provides the English market with meat and wool at the cheapest possible prices.
It is equally interested in reducing, by eviction and forcible emigration, the Irish population to such a small number that English capital (capital invested in land leased for farming) can function there with ‘security’.
It has the same interest in ‘clearing’ the estates of Ireland as it had in the clearing of the agricultural districts of England and Scotland.
The £6,000 -£ 10,000 absentee-landlord and other Irish revenues which at present flow annually to London have also to be taken into account.
“But the English bourgeoisie has, besides, much more important interests in Ireland’s present-day economy.
“Owing to the constantly increasing concentration of tenant-farming, Ireland steadily supplies her own surplus[of labour] to the English labour market, a n d t h u s f o r c e s d o w n w a g e s a n d lowers T H E M O R A L A N D M A T E R I A L C O N D I T I O N O F T H E E N G L I S H work-ing class.

His attitude towards h i m is much the same as that of the poor whites to the Negroes in the former s l a v e states of the U.
S.

The Irishman pays him back with interest in his own coin.
He sees in the English worker at once the accomplice and the stupid tool of the English rule in Ireland.
“This antagonism is artificially kept alive and intensified by the press, the p u l p i t , the c o m i c p a p e r s, in short, by all the means at the disposal of the ruling classes.
This antagonism is the secret of the i m p o t e n c e o f t h e E n g l i s h w o r k -i n g c l a s s, d e s p i t e i t s o r g a n i s a t i o n.
It is the secret by which the capitalist class maintains its power.
And that class is fully aware of it.
“But the evil does not stop here.
It continues across the ocean.
The a n t a g o n i s m between the English and Irish is the hidden basis of the conflict between the United States and England.
It makes any honest and serious co-operation between the working classes of the two countries i m p o s s i b l e .
It enables the governments of both countries, when-ever they think fit, to take the edge off the socialconflict by their mutual bullying and, i n c a s e o f n e e d, b y w a r w i t h o n e a n o t h e r.
“England, being the metropolis of capital, the power which has hitherto ruled the world market, is for the present the most important country f o r t h e w o r k e r s ’ r e v o l u t i o n , and moreover the only country in which the material conditions |||| |||| for this revolution have developed up to a certain |||| N.

degree of maturity.
Therefore to hasten the social |||| |||| revolution in England is the most important object of the International Working Men’s Association.
The sole means of hastening it is to m a k e I r e l a n d independent.
“Hence it is the task of the International everywhere to p u t the conflict between England and Ireland i n t h e f o r e g r o u n d , and everywhere to s i d e o p e n l y w i t h I r e l a n d .
And it is the special task of the Central Council in London to awaken a consciousness in the English workers that for them the n a t i o n a l e m a n -c i p a t i o n of Ireland is n o question of a b s t r a c t justice or humanitarian s e n t i m e n t, but the first condition of their own social emancipation” (pp.

“In inviting the trade unions of Great Britain and Ireland to take part in the Brussels Congress of 1 8 6 8 , the General Council declared: “ ‘ The fundamental principle of the Association is that the produce of labour ought to be the prop-erty of the producer; that the brotherhood of labour should be the basis of society; and that the working men of all countries should throw aside their petty jealousies and n a t i o n a l a n t i p a t h i e s, and make common cause with each other in their struggle with capital.

B.
M N N N Q c o u n t r y ! Working men have the same evils to contend with everywhere.
Capital is but accumu-lated labour.
Why should the labourer be the slave to that which he has himself produced? Too long have the capitalists profited by the national isola-tion of the sons of toil.
Foreign competition has always furnished a plea for the reduction of wages’” (pp.
511-12).
“The ever-ready cry of the British capitalists that the longer working hours and lesser wages of the continental workers make a reduction of wages unavoidable can only be effectually met by the endeavour to approximate the hours of labour and the rate of wages throughout Europe.
* This is one of the tasks of the International Working Men’s Association” (p.
512).
“That is in fact t h e o n l y method of safe-guarding the g a i n s o f t h e m o r e f a v o u r-ably p l a c e d sections of the international proletariat.
These gains will always be in danger as long as they are the possession of only a minor-ity, and the danger will be all the greater, the lower the level of the main mass of the proletariat compared with this minority.
That holds good for the masses within a single country as it does for those o f t h e w h o l e w o r l d m a r k e t.
An advanced p r o l e t a r i a t can main-tain its position by solidarity with and s u p p o r t o f t h o s e w h o h a v e b e e n l e f t b e-h i n d , but not by exclusiveness, by isolating itself from them and keeping them down.
Where, under the influence of a s h o r t -s i g h t e d , c r a f t a t t i t u d e , it adopts the second method, the latter sooner or l a t e r s u f f e r s a f i a s c o and becomes one of the most pernicious means of crippling the proletarian struggle for emancipation” (p.

SEELEY, THE EXPANSION OF ENGLAND The Expansion of England, by J.
R.
Seeley, M.
A.
“Here is a fundamental characteristic of the European states during the eighteenth and seventeenth centuries, which is seldom borne in mind, namely, that each of the five Western states has an empire in the New World attached to it.
Before the seventeenth century this condition of things was but beginning, and since the eighteenth it has ceased again to exist.
The vast, immeasurable results of the discovery of Columbus were developed with extreme slow-ness, so that the whole sixteenth century passed away before most of these nations bestirred themselves to claim a share in the New World.
There existed no independent Holland till near the end of that century, so that a fortiori there could be no Greater Holland, nor did either England or France in that century become possessors of colonies.
France did indeed plan a settlement in North America, as the name Carolina, derived from Charles IX of France, still remains to prove, but the neighbouring Spaniards of Florida interfered to destroy it.
A little later Sir Walter Raleigh’s colony in the same neighbourhood disappeared altogether, leaving no trace behind it.
Accordingly, during almost the whole of that century the New World remained in the possession of the two states which had done most to lay it open, viz.
, Spain and Portugal, Spain looking chiefly towards America and Portugal towards Asia, until in 1580 the two states coalesced in a union which lasted sixty years.
The Dutch made their grand entrance into the com-petition for empire in the seven years from 1595 to 1602, and they were followed by France and England in the early years of the seventeenth century, that is, in the reign of our King James I.
“Again in the nineteenth century, the competition of these five states in the New World ceased.
It ceased from two causes: wars of independence, in which Transatlantic colonies severed themselves from the mother-country, and the colonial conquests of England.
I have described already the Hundred Years’ War in which Greater France was swallowed up in Greater Britain; Greater Holland in like manner suffered serious diminution, losing the Cape ofGood Hope and Demerara to England, though even now a Greater Holland may be said to exist in the magnificent dependency of Java, with a population of not less than nineteen millions.
The fall of Greater Spain and Greater Portugal has happened in the present century within the life-time of many who are still among us.
If we estimated occurrences less by the excitement they cause at the moment and more by the consequences which are certain to follow them, we should call this one of the most stupendous events in the history of the globe, for it is the beginning of the independent life of almost the whole of Southern and Central America.
It took place mainly in the twenties of this cen-tury, and was the result of a series of rebellions which, when we inquire into their origin, we find to have arisen out of the shock given to Spain and Portugal by Napoleon’s inva-sion of them, so that in fact one of the chief, if not the chief, result of Napoleon’s career has been the fall of Greater Spain and Greater Portugal, and the independence of South America.
“The result of all these mighty revolutions—of which, however, I fancy that few of you know anything—is that the Western states of Europe, with the exception of England, have been in the main severed again from the New World.
This of course is only roughly true.
Spain still possesses Cuba and Puerto Rico, Portugal still has large African possessions, France has begun to found a new empire in North Africa.
Nevertheless these four states have materially altered their position in the world.
They have become in the main purely European states again, as they were before Columbus crossed the Atlantic” (pp.
62-64).
“Thus then we see in the seventeenth and still more the eighteenth century a period when the New World was attached in a peculiar way to the five Western states of the European system.
This attachment modifies and deter-mines all the wars and negotiations, all the international relations of Europe, during that period.
In the last lecture I pointed out that the struggle between England and France in those centuries cannot be understood so long as we look at Europe alone, and that the belligerents are really the World-Powers, Greater Britain and Greater France.
Now I remark that in like manner during the same period we mustalways read for Holland, Portugal and Spain, Greater Holland, Greater Portugal and Greater Spain.
I remark also that this state of things has now passed away, that the Span-ish Empire, and in the main also the Portuguese and Dutch Empires, have gone the same way as the Empire of France.
But Greater Britain still remains.
And thus we per-ceive the historical origin and character of this empire” (pp.
64-65).
“We had been involved in two great wars mainly by our colonies, and the final breach was provoked not so much by the pressure of England upon the colonies as by that of the colonies upon England.
If we imposed taxes upon them, it was to meet the debt which we had incurred in their behalf, and we saw with not unnatural bitterness that we had our-selves enabled our colonies to do without us, by destroying for their interest the French power in North America ” (p.
75).
“In the Middle Ages England was, from the point of view of business, not an advanced, but on the whole a backward country.
She must have been despised in the chief commercial countries; as now she herself looks upon the business-system and the banking of countries like Germany and even France as old-fashioned compared to her own, so in the Middle Ages the Italians must have looked upon England.
With their city-life, wide business-connec-tions and acuteness in affairs they must have classed Eng-land, along with France, among the old-world, agricultural, and feudal countries, which lay outside the main current of the ideas of the time” (pp.
96-97).
“Competition for the New World between the five Western maritime states of Europe—this is a formula which sums up a great part of the history of the seventeenth and eight-eenth centuries.
It is one of those generalisations which escape us so long as we study history only in single states” (p.
108).
“How came we to conquer India? Was it not a direct consequence of trading with India? And that is only the most conspicuous illustration of a law which prevails throughout English history in the seventeenth and eight-eenth centuries, the law, namely, of the intimate inter-dependence of war and trade, so that throughout thatperiod trade leads naturally to war and war fosters trade.
I have pointed out already that the wars of the eighteenth century were incomparably greater and more burdensome than those of the Middle Ages.
In a less degree those of the seventeenth century were also great.
These are precisely the centuries in which England grew more and more a com-mercial country.
England indeed grew ever more warlike at that time as she grew more commercial” (p.
120).
“Indeed it is not easy to approve the conduct of those who built up Greater Britain” (p.
145).
“Perhaps you may ask whether we can expect or wish her to prosper, if crime has gone into the making of her.
But the God who is revealed in history does not usually judge in this way.
History does not show that conquests made lawlessly in one generation are certain or even likely to be lost again in another” (p.
146).
“Like our colonial empire itself, our participation in the slave-trade was the gradual growth of the seventeenth century.
By the Treaty of Utrecht it was, as it were, estab-lished, and became ‘a central object of English policy’ (the phrase is borrowed from Mr.
Lecky.
See History of England in the Eighteenth Century, II, p.
13).
From this date I am afraid we took the leading share, and stained ourselves beyond other nations in the monstrous and enor-mous atrocities of the slave-trade” (p.
148).
“I have suggested that in the modern world distance has very much lost its effect, and that there are signs of a time when states will be vaster than they have hith-erto been” (p.
308).

) “There are on the seas at the present time, naval vessels excluded, about 40,000 large merchant ships, under steam or sail, with a net registered tonnage of 25,000,000 metric tons and a carrying capacity of 61,000,000 metric tons” (p.
37).
“It * yields the British more than 180 million marks annu-ally, the Germans (with 220 steam fishing vessels) about 25 million and the French about 10 million marks” (p.
39).
“The length of Germany’s sea coast is only 1,270 km.
, only a quarter of her land frontiers, whereas France faces the sea on three sides and her coasts stretch 3,175 km.
” (p.
41).
“According to the calculations of Professor Dr.
Eckert, in his The Maritime Interests of the Rhineland and West-phalia (1906), a third of all Germany’s imports by sea, and considerably more than a fifth of her total exports by sea, pass through Dutch or Belgian ports” (p.
42).
“At the beginning of 1907 the ‘Veritas’ business agency made a census of 14,656 steamships totalling 18.
9 million registered tons.
Of these, Great Britain had 6,249 with 9.
8 million tons, Germany 1,351 with 2.
1, the United States 885 with 1.
2, and France 586 with 0.
7 million tons.
Of the sailing vessels, too, totalling 26,579 with 7.
5 million registered tons, Great Britain had the largest share— 6,338 ships and 1.
8 million tons.
Next came the United States of America with 3,695 ships and 1.
5 million tons, followed by France with 1,356 and Germany with 991 ships, each with 0.
5 million registered tons.
In the period 1882-1905 the tonnage of British ships passing through the Suez Canal increased 103 per cent, while the German figure increased 1,561 per cent!” (p.
43).
“According to American statistical data, the total world area of coalfields amounts to about 1,500,000 square kilo-metres.
Of this figure, 520,000 sq.

fall to China, 500,000 to the United States, 169,000 to Canada, 91,000 to British India, 62,000 to New South Wales, 52,000 to Russia, 31,000 to Great Britain, 14,000 to Spain, 13,000 to Japan, 5,400 to France, and 4,600 each to Austria, Hungary and Ger-many, and 1,300 to Belgium.
Exploitation depends on the depth, quality and location of the coal deposits.

46-47).
“In the period 1883-1903, coal consumption increased 24 per cent in Britain, 102 per cent in Germany and 129 per cent in the United States” (p.
47).
“Almost three-quarters of British coal exports go to continental Europe and the Mediterranean area” (p.
55).
“The British have accumulated big stocks of coal at all their naval bases, of which there are about forty in all parts of the globe” (pp.
56-57).
“These coal stocks total millions of tons.
Peez once called them signal posts of British maritime supremacy” (p.
57).
“If the freight cost of British coal exports to various countries is reckoned at an average of only five marks per ton, the total export of 58 million tons in 1906 must have yielded British shipping an annual income of some 300 mil-lion marks” (pp.
57-58).
“Unfortunately, it has so far been impossible to oust British coal from the North Sea and Baltic regions.
Berlin itself still obtains a sixth of its requirements (mostly coking coal) from Great Britain” (p.
62).
“The difficult position of German industry in regard to supplies of cotton has been statistically shown by State Secretary Dernburg.
A price increase of four pfennigs perpound increases the cost of the world’s cotton consumption by 320 million marks.
The price increases since 1899 have involved thousands of millions! In 1905, Germany consumed 1.
6 million bales.
In the recent period she paid annually, depending on the price fluctuations engineered by the New York speculators in anticipation of a rise, 150-200 mil-lion marks more * than she did previously, that is to say, five to seven times her annual subsidies to the colonies.
She must free herself of this tax, this foreign tribute.
“In order to avoid the effects of Stock Exchange specula-tion, British merchants and manufacturers more and more frequently visit the Southern States and buy what they need on the spot.
British manufacturers have bought large tracts of land in Texas to grow cotton there themselves or to lease the fields” (p.
81).
“The number of spindles in the United States increased from 14.
6 million in 1890 to 23.
2 million in 1906” (p.
82).
“United States’ consumption in 1906 was 4.
8 million bales (as against 3.
6 million bales in Great Britain and 1.
6 million in Germany).
At the beginning of the 1860s, the United States consumed 20 per cent of its harvest, in the eighties—32 per cent, in the nineties—35 per cent, and since 1900—up to 40 per cent” (p.
82).
“If the United States has no longer to seek foreign mar-kets for the major part of its cotton crop, supplying the world market with cotton becomes a power problem” (p.
83).
“Being in control of the cotton market, the United States has an unusually sharp weapon against Europe, its export tariff.
The European states must at all costs free themselves of this sword of Damocles.
No sacrifice can be too great, for in the last resort it is a question of power, which, however, can be resolved through peaceful effort” (pp.
87-88).
“After the excesses of the 1903 New York cotton specula-tion, on the initiative of the Colonial Economy Committee, there were international congresses of the European cotton industry—in mid-1904 in Zurich, in April 1905 in Brussels, in June 1906 in Manchester, and in May 1907 in Vienna— to devise counter-measures” (p.
88).

“The promotion of cotton growing under the German flag is one of the most important tasks of German colonial .
economy and colonial policy.
That was already appreciated by Bismarck” (p.
90).
“Encouraging cotton cultivation in the colonies will not only ensure for Germany the supply of this indispensable raw material, but also facilitate lasting prosperity of the colonies themselves, which will then develop as purchasers of German industrial goods.
“The Social-Democrat Calwer anticipates advantages for the German workers, too, from cotton cultivation in the German colonies” .

“Great Britain controls 18,369 km.
of railway line in Africa, France 5,657, Germany 1,398, Portugal 1,173, Italy 115, and the Congo state 642” (p.
104).
“Apart from the Social-Democrat nihilists, the opponents of colonies, in spite of all their calculations, have never-theless avoided drawing the final conclusion—they have hesitated to declare that possessions requiring such high subsidies are of no value, they have refrained from demand-ing abandonment of these possessions—and they were very wise not to have done so, for this ultimate conclusion would show up the fallacy of their whole argument” (pp.
113-14).
“The Social-Democrat agitators and press organs waged an especially furious campaign against German colonial policy shortly before the 1907 elections.
The central organ wrote of colonial policy: It ‘wants to establish a new German slave state at the cost of the goods and blood of the German proletariat:’ This policy should be dealt a ‘crushing de-feat’.
“Despite all this, there have been voices in favour of colonies also in the Social-Democratic camp, repudiating those who confine themselves to deriding the German colo-nies as worthless deserts.
“The former Social-Democratic deputy Calwer, writing in the Sozialistische Monatshefte early in 1907, argued against the sharply negative Social-Democratic attitude towards German colonial policy” (p.
121).
“Comrade Calwer showed he was alive to the needs of the international situation when, writing in the Sozial-istische Monatshefte of March 1907, he criticised the Social-Democratic Party leadership for its hostility to the navy” (p.
130).
“Calwer justifiably ridicules those comrades who believe wages in Germany could at once be raised to the British or North American level without building up our position in the colonies and on the world market” (p.
132).
“In 1905-06 Persia’s imports were valued at approximately 140 million marks.
Of these the share of Russia was 70 mil-lion, of Britain 30, of British India 16, of France 8, of Austria-Hungary 5, and of Germany hardly 3 million marks” (pp.
148-49).
“If the Baghdad railway is actually to be built one day under German auspices, and the British do not renounce their proclaimed aims, the Persian Gulf, now an out-of-the-way area, can become a storm centre of world politics” (p.
158).
“As a result of the Monroe Doctrine, the colonial powers, above all Great Britain, but also France, Holland and Denmark, will before long have to reckon with the possi-bility of losing their colonies” (p.
196).
“According to semi-official data, German capital invested in real estate, industry, railways and trade at the end of 1904 amounted to 5,000-6,000 million marks for America as a whole, and to 2,800-3,400 million marks for Central and South America alone” (p.
229).
“It is estimated that more than 2,000 million marks of United States capital have been invested in Canadian real estate and factories.
“According to semi-official data for mid-1907, United States investments in Mexico amounted to approximately 3,500-4,000 million marks” (pp.
232-33).
“The two biggest electric companies of Europe and Amer-ica—the Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft in Berlin and the General Electric Company in New York—have an agreement on division of the world market into two spheres of interests.
The American company was able to secure for its exclusive exploitation also Central and South America” (p.
249).
“Preferential tariffs, where they have been introduced, have proved inadequate to oust foreign commercial inter-ests.
Such preferential tariffs will always be imposed only to a very limited degree, since local interests, especially those of rising industries, and also those of declining agri-culture, demand not merely a certain protection but also the exclusion of all foreign monopolies.
The resistance is so strong that it will frustrate the efforts of British imperial and pan-American tariff supporters to attain their final goal—the creation of a completely closed customs union.
“Both these formations were contrary to the general economic development of the recent period with its urge for the expansion of international trade by overcoming artificial barriers, with the need of the strong states to gain a free sphere for economic activity beyond their own fron-tiers, indeed beyond their own continent.
As a matter of fact, the drive for large, self-sufficient customs unions has abated” (pp.
254-55).
“There is no struggle for supremacy in Europe.
Should it be provoked by Great Britain, it is by no means bound to lead to war.
As long as the Liberal government remains in power, peace will be ensured, for among its most loyal supporters are precisely the British friends of world peace, who are not at all actuated by ill-will towards Germany” (p.

“At any rate, one must recall the mood of disquiet pre-vailing in Europe during the years 1906-08, particu-larly in Germany.
We have seen how in 1906 and 1907 King Edward’s Entente policy of ‘encircling’ Germany gained more and more political reality.
With the Medi-terranean agreements and the agreement with Russia that policy, it seemed, had run full circle” (p.

“The capitalist mode of production has already played this role of the most powerful stimulus to the development of the productive forces.
In the eighties of the last century it had already reached the limit beyond which it becomes more and more a hindrance to their further development.
Not yet in the sense of making any further growth of these forces impossible—such a growth is still taking place—butin the sense that a mode of production has already become possible in which productivity rises faster than under the capitalist mode.
In the interests of self-preservation, the capitalist mode of production is compelled increasingly to block the growth of productivity” (p.
35).
“Today socialism has already become an economic neces-sity.
The time of its arrival is only a question of power.
To create this power for the proletariat by organisation and education is today more than ever the most important task of Social-Democracy.
Nothing is more peculiar than those socialists who believe that alongside this they must be concerned also for a further development of the power of capitalism” (p.

“The end of the letter relates to the British occupation of Egypt following the rising led by Arabi Pasha.
On this subject there was recently published a letter by Engels dated August 9, 1882, in which he warned against a purely sentimental approach to the Egyptian national movement.
And from that the conclusion was drawn that the British annexation of Egypt met with special sympathy from Engels.
We see now how far this was from being the case” * (pp.

QUADFLIEG, THE RUSSIAN POLICY OF EXPANSION, 1774 -1914 The Russian Policy of Expansion, 1774-1914, by Dr.
Franz Quadflieg, Berlin, 1914.
“In the meantime, by the Kuwait treaty, Britain has transferred her differences with Russia on the Turkish issue to Armenia and Asia Minor; Russia is working secretly in Armenia; France is hankering after Syria, and Germany is after territorial acquisitions on the Euphrates.
Thus for another century, probably with short intervals, the Turkish question will continue to agitate Europe, and Russian diplomacy will have to devote more attention to South Asia.
Russia’s gigantic expansion policy in Asia means that her future, too, lies on the seas; without a strong and freely-moving navy there can be no Russian Asia; passage through the Sea of Marmara is the more important for Russian naval policy because in 1905 Russia again lost her favourable position in Eastern Asia” (p.
96).
“Even after the partition Treaty of August 7, 1907, the above-mentioned projects could be carried out without violation of the treaty provisions.
The 1907 treaty divided Persia into three parts, viz.
, Russian and British spheres of influence, and a zone common to both powers.
The British and Russian governments undertook not to acquire any concessions of a political or commercial nature in the re-spective spheres of influence, and not to assist such acquisition by their own nationals or those of third states.
The whole of northern Persia, i.
e.
, north of the line Qasri—Shirin— * This paragraph is Kautsky’s postscript to Engels’s letter.
—Ed.
Esfahan—Yazd—Khakh up to the intersection of the Per-sian-Afghan-Russian frontiers is reserved for Russia, while Britain will exercise her influence in the East, i.
e.
, south-east of the Bandar Abbas—Kerman—Birjand—Gazik line” (p.
134).
“The final act of Anglo-Russian policy was the conclusion of the Anglo-Turkish agreement by Hakki-Pasha in London in 1913; we shall have to return to it in connection with Russian policy in Asia Minor.
Under it Britain obtained the terminal portion of the Baghdad railway, Basra-Baghdad, i.
e.
, another link of the Cyprus-India line.
Furthermore, Turkey gave up the Kuwait Sultanate, which indeed was always only loosely dependent on Turkey, and was now to become a vassal state of Britain.
This means that the entire South-West coast of the Persian Gulf from the mouth of the Euphrates to the Straits of Hormuz becomes British” (p.
135).
“Russian policy in Persia has been less successful than British because Britain can threaten Persia from the sea” (p.
136).
“Latterly Russia has reverted to her earlier policy of engineering revolts, i.
e.
, is again using the Armenians to instigate revolts in the Turkish areas, though, of course, so far not much can be said about this.
Britain, on the other hand, made use of the 1913 Balkan disorders to carry out peaceful reforms, so that Russia should not have any grounds for intervention; should, however, such inter-vention prove necessary, it would be the duty of Britain, since Turkey has promised her to introduce reforms.
Under the Kuwait treaty, Britain guarantees the Sultan his Turkish possessions in Asia for forty years.
She thus acquires the right, in the event of attempted Russian conquests, again to act as Turkey’s protector and oblige the Russians to return possible acquisitions.
In return, Turkey promises to carry out reforms in Armenia, Anatolia and other Asia Minor areas with a partially Christian population” (pp.
146-47).
“‘Accordingly, Britain has guaranteed Turkey’s territo-rial integrity for forty years, and under present conditions this is important in relation to Russia, which is engaged in subversive activity in Armenia’—writes Rohrbach” * (p.
147).

“The construction of a communications network, con-sisting of railways, waterways and military roads, shows that Russia does not consider the South-Asian problem settled.
On the contrary, this construction programme sug-gests that at the appropriate time arms will decide who is to be the sole ruler of South Asia” (p.
171).
“Already in 1903 Prince Ito urged a Russo-Japanese alliance, since unity would be bound to make partition of the Chinese Empire considerably easier and give everyone concerned a proper share” (p.
173).
“The Russo-Japanese treaty of July 17 (30), 1907, testifies to the new trend of both Russian and Japanese policy.
Britain was thus isolated and the value of the Anglo-Japa-nese alliance was greatly diminished” (pp.
173-74).
“Shortly after the Russo-Japanese agreement Britain concluded with Russia the convention of August 7, 1907, by which Russia renounced, for the time being, any further penetration in Afghanistan” (p.
174).
“The Russo-Japanese policy of rapprochement had its continuation in the treaty of July 4, 1910, which closely resembles a defensive alliance” (p.
219).
“It was broadened by a supplementary treaty of May 7, 1911.
The two states pledged themselves to respect each other’s spheres of influence in Manchuria and repel any foreign interference, in return for which Japan gave Russia complete freedom of action in Mongolia” (p.
220).
“In line with the May 7, 1911 treaty, Russia now raised the question of Mongolia.
Basing themselves on the revolu-tion and the fact that the Chinese immigration policy, by which peaceful settlers were followed by military contingents, violated the existing treaties between the Manchus and the Khalkha tribes, the Mongolian princes proclaimed the independence of their region.
Russia hastened to recognise the independence of Mongolia, although she had done nothing to contribute to its realisation” (pp.
220-21).
“Though the semblance of Chinese overlordship remained, the Russian press was not far off the mark in asserting that Mongolia had become a Russian protectorate.
Russian diplomacy had achieved the same results as in Korea prior to 1904.
This time, having an agreement of Japan, Russiamay be more fortunate than she was then, when she had to combat Japanese resistance” (p.
221).
“The only question is whether China can reorganise herself.
China is a compact mass of 300 million people who love their country and are not a little embittered by its treatment at the hands of foreigners.
The 1911 revolution ended in the removal of the Manchus.
Thereby China accom-plished her first task—the overthrow of foreign rule—which she had so often and so unsuccessfully attempted.
Will Yüan Shih-kai or someone else be the re-maker of China? Once awoken, China will be a more dangerous opponent of Russian expansion than Japan, and Prince Ukhtomsky was quite right when he said: ‘China will regenerate herself through her own forces, as has so often happened in the many thousand years of her history, more slowly but perhaps more permanently than Japan, and then the question will no longer be Russia or Japan, but Russia or China’” (p.
222).
“The guiding motive of Russia’s nineteenth-century Balkan policy was control of the Turkish areas, whether by their constitutional inclusion in the Russian Empire, or by dominion, on the basis of international law, over Turkey herself, or over a federation of Balkan states formed out of the Turkish Empire.
Such dominion could be converted later into constitutional imperial rule.
“However diverse Russia’s final aims in Central and South Asia, including Asia Minor, may have been in specific periods, they can be reduced to a single formula.
The final aim is to bring the states concerned—Armenia with Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan and the adjacent small states— under Russian influence, then under a Russian protectorate and ultimately incorporate them in the Russian Empire” (pp.
227-28).
“Russia has temporarily renounced Korea and part of Manchuria, but she has made a rapprochement with the Japanese in order the more surely to incorporate Mongolia and Northern Manchuria in the empire.
By cleverly exploit-ing the special political and social relations which have always existed between Mongolia and the dominant state, China, this policy appears, with the consent of the Japanese government, to be achieving its aim.
And from this it follows that in Eastern Asia, too, Russia is consistentlyworking to a well-devised plan of expansion, which may be modified according to circumstances but remains essentially unaltered, the aim being direct domination of the vast territories right up to the Chinese Wall and supre-macy in Eastern Asia.
.
.
.
“It can therefore be concluded that the basic idea of nine-teenth-century Russian policy was the creation of a world empire, that is, a state whose final frontiers are not deter-mined by any of the decisive factors that go into the forma-tion of a state.
The frontiers aimed at coincide neither with nationality, language, race, nor even—what is certainly less often taken into account—religious boundaries.
Nor are they determined by physical features, and therefore do not everywhere coincide with natural geographical bound-aries” (pp.
230-31).
“‘World empires,’ says Sering, ‘have always monopolised the earth, the source of all material wealth.
’ The modern world empires, Russia, Great Britain and America, go further.
They have expanded, or seek to expand, their empires over all zones, not in a literal sense, but in such a way that everything the earth can yield will be produced within the bounds of their empire.
Great Britain has already done that.
Occupying a quarter of the inhabited surface of the globe, there is nothing, as Chamberlain proudly declared at the conference of colonial Prime Ministers, that cannot be produced in one or another part of the far-flung empire.
Russia and America, if they succeed in realising their plans of world empire, will seize the next two quarters of the world and be in the same favourable position as the British Empire” (p.
234).
“The other path, specifically relating to Germany, is described by Schmoller as follows: ‘We do not want to pursue, nor will we pursue, a chauvinistic world-power policy.
We shall not embark on unlimited expansion of our navy and sea power, but we want to expand our trade and industry sufficiently to be able to live and support a grow-ing population; we want to defend our colonies and if possi-ble acquire somewhere an agricultural colony for Germany; we shall everywhere oppose exaggerated predatory mercantilism and a division of the world among the three world powers— Great Britain, Russia and North America—which strive toexclude all other states and at the same time destroy their trade.
’ But this second path can now only be adopted, with any prospect of success, by a few Great Powers” (p.
237).
“Britain has always been the friend of the weaker power, * in order to bring down the stronger to a level that is no longer dangerous for her.
First of all she allied with Holland to destroy the power of Spain, then with France to put an end to the rule of the Netherlands at sea, then she supported Frederick the Great to be in a better position to dismember France’s colonial empire; in the same manner she allied with Japan to counteract the threatening growth of Russian power in East Asian waters; today she has become France’s or Russia’s friend so as to he able to destroy Germany’s position as a naval power; she will become Germany’s ally as soon as she has nothing more to fear from the German navy, either because the latter will be destroyed, or because Germany will voluntarily give up competing with her.
And then her next opponent could prove to be the tsarist empire” (p.
246).

This alliance has persisted for a long time because there can only be minor points of dispute between its three members; such disagree-ments exist only between Austria and Italy, since Austria still has an Italian-speaking population on the frontier with Italy.
And this antagonism is intensified by the intrigues of Italian irredentists in Trieste and the Italian Tyrol.
The conversion of this very loose international union into a firmer one cannot, therefore, be dismissed out of hand.

have the beginnings of a European association of states.
With-out any aggressive designs, three great European states have joined together to counter the attack of Slavism or, more pre-cisely, the encroachment of Russia and of the small Slav Balkan states that follow Russia’s lead” (pp.
248-49).
“The unity of the European continental powers, so neces-sary in face of the world powers, Britain and Russia, who are joined by a third, the United States of America, with its pan-American aspirations, which have made notable progress since the Monroe Doctrine, is in this way being frustrated.
As long as the European states remain disunited, these three powers can go further in dividing up the rest of the world.
The Anglo-Russian struggle in Asia showed that these two powers almost alone came into consideration, the other European states playing a very secondary role.
As pointed out above, throughout the century Russia has, with short intervals, enlarged her empire first in one place and then in another.
Equally, too, no decade has passed without Britain expanding her mighty empire, beginning with the occupation of Malta in 1800 and continuing up to the conquest of the Boer Republic in 1900.
While Russia and Britain divided the non-European world between them, the North Americans have specially reserved for them-selves the entire American continent as an object of con-quest.
Hence the Russian policy of conquest appears as merely the counterpart of British imperialism and North American pan-Americanism.
Although outwardly differing in their individual aims, they all have the same ultimate goal—an independent world state cut off from the outside world by a high tariff wall.
The movement to build world states began in the nineteenth century; in the twentieth century it will be the central feature of foreign policy.
This tendency will manifest itself in the expansion of the leading powers and in the association of the smaller coun-tries and those who arrive on the scene too late, i.
e.
, in an association of the European states with the exception of Britain and Russia.
Chamberlain’s statement in his Johannes-burg speech of January 17, 1903, will be confirmed: ‘The day of small kingdoms with petty jealousies is past, the future is with the great empires’” (pp.
254-55).

NOTEBOOK “DATA ON PERSIA” 86 Contents Demorgny [1-41] Jaeger [5-11] DEMORGNY, THE PERSIAN QUESTION AND THE WAR G.
D e m o r g n y , The Persian Question and the War, Paris, 1916.
((The author is a legal adviser to the Persian Government and professor of the Teheran School of Political Science.
Also author of many books and articles on Persia—both in Persian and French.
)) Highly instructive as a description of the truly miserable state of Persia, shamelessly humiliated and robbed by three—primarily—Great Powers.
Russia, Great Britain and Germany.
The author is, of course, wholly a French “patriot”.
All the more interesting, therefore, is his ruthless and compelled exposure of the conflict—a most bitter con-flict—b e t w e e n R u s s i a a n d G r e a t B r i t a i n .
Formally, Persia is neutral in this war.
In actual fact, however, both the Russians and the British, on the one hand, and the Turks and the Germans, on the other, are fighting and plundering on P e r s i a n territory.
p.
77: August 27, 1915; the German Vice-consul Schoenemann attacks the Russian and British consuls, etc.
N.
B.
!! The book has a map of Persia showing the Russian and British “zones of influence”.
The treaty between Russia and Great Britain (1907) demarcating their respective “spheres of influence” in Persia did not satisfy them (“the implementation (of the 1907 treaty) did not achieve the aim” (67))—their conflict and mutual distrust continued (“Anglo-Russian rivalry”, p.
64 and passim).
Germany exploited this, and her treaty with Russia (the Potsdam meeting, 1 9 1 0) was “a triumph for German diplomacy” (p.
57)—an attempt to divide Persia between Germany and Russia.
“We shall divide Persia between us and oust Great Britain” (57)—thus Demorgny sums up the content (more correctly: the mea-ning and substance) of this treaty.
“Anglo-Indian imperialism” (p.
6 5 et seq.
).
Great Britain is actually in full control of the “neutral zone”, too (within Persia), and the struggle with Russia continues.
“Beginning with the government, everything of impor-tance in the country joins either the Russian, German or British clientele” (78).
There are frequent quotations from The Strangling of Persia, by Morgan S h u s t e r , New York, 1912.
The Russians accused him of “dictatorial” behaviour and forced him to leave the country (January 11, 1912).
The British tried to defend him but with no success.
The author calls his book “bitter” (“a bitter book against Persia, Russia, Great Britain and Germany” (86)) and says that he “did not understand the situa-tion”, that he was “no diplomat” (a “poor diplomat” (85)).
Foreign powers cannot obtain concessions in Persia without the consent of Russia or Great Britain (80).
Let us (French) not forget S y r i a in our calculations (82).
.
.
.
The consuls (of the three Great Powers) resort to shame-less intrigues, hire gangs, incite conflicts, “consular fury” (p.
110 and elsewhere), slander “moderate” ambassadors, etc.
(p.
89 and elsewhere, about Russia).
“The aim is control over the national N.
B.
! finances.
This has become a new and || very fashionable formula for a disguised || well said! || protectorate” (93, note).

120, etc.

“The Dzhulfa—Tabriz—Rezaiyeh—Teheran railway concession was granted on January 24 (February 6), 1913, to the Russian Discount Bank in Teheran” (168).
.
.
.
“From 1912-14 Anglo-Russian rivalry in Persia has con-tinued in the same forms” (196).
“There was also the much discussed question of a big trans-Persian railway.
.
.
.
Anglo-Russian rivalry on this issue, skilfully fostered by the Persian Government, was adroitly exploited by Germany.
On this issue, too, French interests have up to now been subordinated to the secret machinations of certain financial groups” (262).
.
.
.
“On December 24” (1915 or 191 4 ?) “a bomb intended to destroy the Russian, French, Belgian and British ministers was exploded in Teheran, but the attempt failed and the bomb killed one of the participants in the plot, which was organised by a German-Turkish gang.
The German Legation was not discouraged, it recruited a thousand bandits at ninety francs per month each and gave them weapons.
These men hastened to sell the rifles and cartridges and make off” (273).
A meeting of Russian industrialists in Moscow on November 23, 1910, was opposed to a trans-sic!! Persian railway, because, they argued, it would facilitate British and German competition (266-67).
(In Persia now, 1915) “there are no longer spheres N.
B.
of influence, the Russians and the British now help one another against the Germans.
Three hundred Cossacks have left Meshed in pursuit of four German officers and 83 Bakhtiars, who recently left Meshed for Afghanistan, where they want to instigate an uprising” (296).

In 1902 Russia concluded a trade treaty with Persia by which she ensured a market for “her” sugar, oil, etc.
(71).

Morgan Shuster says this tariff is extremely harmful for Persia and profitable for Russia (73)—(p.

In reality all foreign policy is in the hands of Great Britain; the Emir is on Britain’s pay -roll.
Under the Anglo-Russian treaty (August 31, 1907), Britain recognised freedom of trade in Afghani-stan, and Russia recognised Afghanistan as being “outside her sphere of influence”.
The British do not even allow foreigners to enter! Afghan-istan (!! p.
154).
Militarily, the Afghans “should by no means be under-estimated as adversaries” (157).
Britain treats them with the greatest caution: “In this one sees the wisdom of Britain’s ‘velvet glove’ policy, for the British could not behave to anyone more tolerantly and cautiously than they N .

The country maintains “the closest relations of friendship and alliance with Bri-tain”, (the country) “has, of course, put its whole !! foreign policy entirely in her (Britain’s) hands, but for the rest is as much an independent native state as, say, Afghanistan or Nepal” (174-75).
The author’s conclusion: “As against that” (in contrast to wicked Brit-ain and Russia) “Germany’s desire can only be not to insert herself as a third force between the two brothers—Russia and Britain—so that under certain circumstances, she shall not be attacked there by both of them; on the contrary, Germany’s aim, as in all similar cases (Turkey, Morocco), can only be a strong, independent Persia with equal rights for all, at most with some special privileges for Germany” (176).

Only a bourgeois-democratic principle? What about the BROTHERHOOD of the workers? No, it is also a socialist principle.
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | When we advance the slogan: freedom of self-determina-tion, that is, freedom of secession, by our w h o l e agita-tion we are demanding from the oppressors: try to hold the people by granting advantages, spreading culture, and not by force.
If we do not accept and emphasise freedom of secession, we i n p r a c t i c e leave the door open for the advocates of violence.
Nur so treffen wir den Nagel auf den Kopf [only so do we hit the nail on the head]—we teach the workers: drive away all those who do not recognise the democratic and socialist principle sincerely and honestly .
THESES Five (?) (better four) theses: (1) Social-Democrats of an oppressor nation, particularly of the so-called Great Powers, must demand the right to self-determination = the right to secession for the oppressed nations, upholding this right not only in the legal, but especially in the illegal, press and especially in wartime.
—(2) Social-Democrats of the oppressed nations must demand the fullest, including organ-isational, merging, and not merely rapprochement, of the w o r k e r s of the oppressed nation with the w o r k e r s of the oppressor nation.
—(3) On the basis of these principles, the Social-Democrats of all the advanced twentieth-century countries, and especially of the Great Powers, must make the principle: “the workers have no fatherland” the corner-stone of their national policy, without in any way denying the world-historic importance of the national emancipation movement of the backward East European and the Asian and African colonial peoples.
—(4) Social-Democrats of all countries must uphold, n o t the federative principle, n o t the formation of small states, as the ideal, but the closest unity of nations, stressing the harmfulness of all separation of nations, the harmfulness of cultural-national autonomy, the advantage of d e m o c r a t i c centralism, the advantage of very big states and unions of states.
5 t h t h e s i s : In view of the elementary, ABC nature of thesis No.
1, its acceptance by all democrats and Marx & Engels 1848-76, and its confirmation by the experience of the war,—Social-Democrats who do not recognise this thesis should be treated as enemies of the proletariat and deceivers of the worst kind, and expelled from the Party.
It is not enough to accept the struggle against a l l national oppression, against all national inequality: (α) Does “inequality” cover the right to independent statehood? or not? (β) the right to secession or not? (γ) the nature of daily agitation: its main aim and direction.
Unity of the workers, unity of the proletariat’s interna-tional class struggle, is infinitely more important than the problem of state frontiers, which in the era of imperialism will especially often be resolved, by war.
IMPERIALISM AND THE RIGHT OF NATIONS TO SELF-DETERMINATION (OUTLINE) [October 28, 1915] Introduction (1) The urgency of the Problem: A talking point every-where.
Why? (α) War inflames national enmity and threatens national oppression.
(β) Imperialism is the era of the oppression of nations on a new historical basis.
(2) The task of the “Z i m m e r w a l d L e f t ” 90 is to unite, and on this basis a l s o to smash social-chauvinism, to clarify the mind of the working class.
I.
T h e E c o n o m i c S t a n d p o i n t (3) “Capital has o u t g r o w n national bounds.
The union of nations (in a single state) is inevitable and prog-ressive.
” True! But Marxism is not Struvism, 91 it is not a justification and defence of coercion of nations, but a revolutionary struggle for socialism, the u n i o n of the workers of different nations, their b r o t h e r h o o d .
(4) Against coercion, f o r the democratic union of nations.
“Freedom of secession” is the h i g h e s t expres-sion of d e m o c r a c y.
(5) Democracy, freedom of secession, bénefit economic union (Norway and Sweden; America versus Germany).
II.
T h e H i s t o r i c a l S t a n d p o i n t (6) “Self-determination is the tattered slogan of a bygone era of bourgeois-democratic revolutions and movements.
” —Imperialism gives rise to the oppression of nations on a new basis.
Imperialism gives new life to this old slogan.
(7) The East and the c o l o n e s ( > 1,000 million of the world’s population).
“New” bourgeois-democratic national movements.
Colonies 1876—314 million & 81% 1914—570 ” III.
T h e P o l i t i c a l S t a n d p o i n t (8) We do not discard bourgeois-democratic slogans, but more consistently, fully and decisively implement what is d e m o c r a t i c in them.
(9) The interests of brotherhood, of the solidarity of the w o r k e r s of different nations, rather than the interests of nations.
IV.
T h e S t a n d p o i n t o f S t a t e F r o n t i e r s (10) We do not uphold the e x i s t i n g state frontiers.
(11) We do not support the utopia of small states, do not everywhere and always demand the “independence of national states”.
.
.
.
(12) Under all possible c h a n g e s of state frontiers we put in the forefront the interests of the workers’ class struggle.
(13) The “disintegration” of Russia (Great Britain, Austria?) = United States.
V.
T h e S t a n d p o i n t o f t h e P r o l e t a r i a t’s International Class Struggle (14) The danger (and inevitability under capitalism) of national enmity and distrust (à la Axelrod? No!).
(15) The crux: the attitude of the o p p r e s s i n g nations to the oppressed nations .
(16) The class solidarity of the workers of different nations is impossible without recognising the right to secession.
V I .
“P r a c t i c a l F e a s i b i l i t y ” (17) “Utopia”! Norway versus Sweden.
(18) The “exception”! (“Backwoods region.
”) Yes, like a l l democratic reforms and changes.
(19) “In practice = nil.
” No = (α) freedom of agitation for secession (β) solution of the problem of secession by a referendum (2 §§ of the Constitution) (20) “What guarantees are there? Only war can give the answer!” (Our guarantees—educating the workers in the spirit of the brotherhood of nations.
) VII.
T h e M i l i t a r y S t a n d p o i n t (21) “Self-determination of nations = justifying par-ticipation in war.
” There are wars and wars.
We do not “deny” national wars.
They are possible now, too.
(22) “Given self-determination, Holland, Sweden, etc.
, have the right to defend themselves.
” H o w can one defend oneself in an i m p e r i a l i s t war? VIII.
T h e S t r u g g l e A g a i n s t S o c i a l -C h a u v i n i s m (23) Social-chauvinism is as inevitable a product of impe-rialism as wireless telegraphy.
The struggle against it is now the very heart of the matter.
(24) The struggle against the chauvinism of o n e ’s o w n nation.
(25) The main feature—G r e a t-P o w e r chauvinism.
(26) “Recognition of equality” = an evasion of the problem of s t a t e h o o d , of s e c e s s i o n , of instances of impe-rialist w a r.
(27) Wir treffen den Nagel auf den Kopf (we hit the nail on the head) o n l y by our formulation.

The plutocratic nations (France, Britain, Germany) “are pacifist” (sic!) (ha-ha!) “mainly because they are plutocratic” (188), whereas the proletarian nations (Italy), in fighting against Turkey were fighting the plutocratic nations (sic!! ha-ha!).
Imperialism (he says) is a modern phenomenon, but it divides nations into plutocratic and proletarian; “it [nationalism] is the socialism of the Italian nation in the world” (156).
Other nations are big-time robbers: that is the substance of this wretched book.
“Socialism” consists in our little and poor nation overtaking or trying to overtake the big robbers so that it may rob more!! N.

Taxes, monop-olies, rationing—all this has no relation to socialism (communism, he says, = the regulation of consumption, socialism = the abolition of private property).

Leading article: “ Social-Imperialism and Left Radical-ism ”.

“It [Left radicalism] was the trend in German radi-calism which took shape during the campaign for the suffrage in Prussia and in the 1910-13 debates on disarmament”.
.
.
.

.
“He (Kautsky) sought to depict imperialism N.
B.
as a form of capitalist expansion which could give way to another, peaceful form”.
.
.
.
Among these Lefts were “Rosa Luxemburg, Pannekoek, Radek, Thalheimer, Zetkin and others”.
.
.
.
.
.
.
“The Left radicals waged a sharp struggle against the survivals of the British Manchesterism ideology in foreign policy” (Ledebour and K.
Kautsky, also Eckstein).
.
.
.
The Left radicals and social-imperialists find common ground in that “the world has entered the imperialist era”.
.
.
.
.
.
.
“For the Left radicals, even the militia is not a means for abolishing the expansionist tendencies of imperial-ism—they favour it only in the hope that it will bring to maturity the anti-imperialist tendencies of the masses.
The social-imperialists, on the other hand, use every approach to a militia presented by this war, but which can be achieved only in opposition to the policy upheld by the war, as a bait for militarising Social-Democracy”.

“The Trade Union Movement in 1915”.
.
.
.
Sub-heading: “Trade Union Ideologies”.
.
.
.
Two trends which are not part of reformism or radicalism— Korrespondenzblatt and Sozialistische Monatshefte.
“On the other hand, there are only a few trade union journals which clearly express their dissident, more radical views.
For the most part these are organs of trade unions whose membership consists mainly of unskilled workers or women” (325).
.
.
.
.
.
.
”For the organs of the old, big unions are wholly on the side of the majority, whereas the others are more reserved.
There is no evidence, as far as we can see, of a definite attitude in favour of the views and tactics of the minority” (327).
.
.
.
Of the metalworkers’ union, the author says the Executive Committee supports the majority, wages in this trade are higher (330), fewer have been called up, * it is an old and very big union, “which has always been a bulwark of moderate views”, but at a general meeting on June 30, 1915.
.
.
a motion was passed that was, indirectly, practically a censure of the Executive Commit-tee: “The adoption of this motion indicates at any rate that other views and moods prevail among the rank and file than those in the leadership” (332).
.
.
.
A “petty-bourgeois stratum” is developing at the top (335).
.
.
.
Korrespondenzblatt (April 17, 1915) declares that the struggle against imperialism is as much an absurdity as the destruction of machines.
It censures the majority in the French and British unions (the same as the majority it itself represents) and this evokes a malicious remark by the bourgeois author: “It cannot be said, therefore, that the Right-wing ten-dency in Germany has altogether ceased to understand radical labour policy” (338).
Properly speaking, the author admits, the majority are no longer socialists (p.
340 and elsewhere).

GAZETA ROBOTNICZA’S 97 THESES ON IMPERIALISM AND NATIONAL OPPRESSION (SUMMARY) I (1) Definition of imperialism (economic).
Alteration of frontiers.
The “national state”.
(Was) not the s o l e form (under certain conditions&state of nationalities) colonies and contributions annexations—intensification of n a t i o n a l o p -pression.
(2) (Contradicts working-class interests).
.
.
(especially of o p p r e s s e d nations) (revanche) (3) Against annexations and national oppression (must be vigorously combated (energisch bekämpfen)) (socialism does not need colonies) against peace with annexations (4) The struggle against forcible domination consists in (1) rejection of defence of the fatherland.
.
.
.
(2) exposure (Denunzierung) of national oppression (3) the struggle with moral coercion against the national movement (5) Imperialism cannot be transformed in a way that would accord with the interests of the working class imperialism cannot be purged of national oppression; only socialism .
.
.
the struggle must be revolutionary and, under socialism, for j o i n t d e t e r m i n a t i o n, not self-determination, no delay, no holding out hopes.

!FRAGMENT OF AN ARTICLE How far Engels was from the indifferent attitude to modern German annexations, so characteristic of certain doctrinaire distorters of Marxism among present-day German Social-Democrats, is evident from the following statement he made in 1893: “We should not forget that twenty-seven years of Bis-marck’s administration made Germany hated everywhere— and with good reason.
Neither the annexation of the North Schleswig Danes, nor the non-observance, and subsequent swindling cancellation, of the Prague Peace Treaty Article relating to them, nor the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, nor the shabby measures taken against the Prussian Poles, have had anything at all to do with establishing ‘national unity’” (Can Europe Disarm= Nuremberg, 1893, p.
27).
104 Under the Prague Treaty of August 23, 1866, Austria ceded Schles-wig-Holstein to Prussia on condition that the northern districts of Schleswig should be ceded to Denmark if by a free vote their population pronounced in favour of union with Denmark.
The swindling cancellation of this article was effected by the Vienna Treaty between Germany and Austria of October 11, 1878.
Even after fifteen years, in 1893, Engels remembers this deception and brands it as such, stressing the distinction between the creation of German national unity and the series of coercive and swin-dling oppressive measures in relation to peoples dependent on the Germans.

NOTES AND INDEXESNOTES 1 Lenin’s Notebooks on Imperialism is a collection of materials for his book Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism.
The book was written in 1916, at the height of the First World War, but Lenin had drawn attention to the new phenomena in the development of capitalism long before the war.
Thus, at the end of 1899 he referred to America as a land of cartels, which, while limiting production for the home market, “expand it for the foreign market, selling their goods abroad at a loss and extracting monopoly prices from consumers in their own country” (see present edition, Vol.
4, p.
202).
In a 1908 article, “Marxism and Revisionism” Lenin stressed that the new giant trusts were evidence that capitalism was heading for a break-down.
Lenin’s comprehensive study of the monopoly stage of capitalism began early in the First World War.
Such a study was vital to the working-class revolutionary struggle in Russia and other capital-ist countries.
Correct leadership of that movement and successful opposition to the ideology of imperialist reaction and reformist conciliation with the imperialists required an understanding of the “fundamental economic question, that of the economic essence of imperialism, for unless this is studied, it will be impossible to understand and appraise modern war and modern politics” (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
188).
Lenin’s thorough study of the literature on imperialism apparent-ly began in mid-1915, when he was in Berne.
He compiled source references, drew up plans for the book, made copious extracts, notes and detailed conspectuses—which together form the contents of the Notebooks on Imperialism.
Early in January 1916, Parus, a legal publishing house founded in Petrograd in December 1915, asked him to write a book on imperialism.
Lenin agreed, and on January 11, 1916 he wrote to Maxim Gorky from Berne: “I am getting down to the writing of a pamphlet on imperialism.
” In mid-February, Lenin left Berne for Zurich, where he continued to collect and analyse data on impe-rialism.
He worked in the Zurich Cantonal Library but ordered books also from other towns.
In a short space of time Lenin studied and critically analysed a vast amount of source material and drew up an outline of the book, a scientific study of imperialism.
On July 2, 1916, Lenin wrote to M.
N.
Pokrovsky, then living in Paris and connected with the Parus publishers: “Today I am sending you the manuscript by registered book-post.
” The book, Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, was first published in April 1917.
Lenin’s notes, extracts, outlines, etc.
, fill fifteen notebooks denoted by the letters of the Greek alphabet from “alpha” to “omicron”, besides which there is the “Brailsford” notebook and other mate-rials.
Lenin continued to collect data and make extracts on various aspects of imperialism after he had sent his manuscript to the publishers.
Evidence of this is the Notebook “Egelhaaf”, which Lenin began in October 1916 (see this volume, p.
680 and p.
765), the Notebook “Data on Persia” (p.
719) and others.
p.
27 2The article on the struggle against the “Marsh” (Notes on Kautsky-ism) was apparently never written.
p.
30 3This refers to Kautsky’s pamphlet Der Weg zur Macht (The Road to Power), published in Berlin in 1909.
Lenin called it Kautsky’s “last and best work” against the opportunists.
The Basle Manifesto on war was adopted by the Extraordinary Congress of the Second International in Basle, November 24-25, 1912.
It exposed the predatory aims of the war the imperialists were preparing and called on the workers of all countries to wage a vigor-ous struggle for peace, against the threat of war and “to oppose to capitalist imperialism the power of international proletarian solidarity”.
Should imperialist war break out, it said, socialists must take advantage of the economic and political crisis it will cause so as to advance the socialist revolution (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
208-17 and 307-08).
The leaders of the Second Inter-national (Kautsky, Vandervelde, etc.
) voted for the Manifesto at the Congress, but consigned it to oblivion and supported their imperialist governments when the war broke out.
p.
30 4This refers to paragraph 9 of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
Programme adopted at the Party’s Second Congress.
Paragraph 9 proclaimed “the right to self-determination of all the nations making up the state”.
p.
42 5The data on the annual wages of workers in the U.
S.
A.
in 1913 are taken from an article by Scott Nearing, “The Adequacy of American Wages”, published in The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Vol.
LIX, p.
115.
p.
48 6Marx’s concept of “socialisation”, based on a scientific analysis of the objective laws of development of capitalist society, points to the necessity and inevitability of the means of production passing from private capitalist ownership to social ownership.
Lenin showed that the conflict between the production relations and the productive forces under capitalism becomes very acute in the era of imperial-ism.
In this last stage of capitalism the concentration and social-isation of production reach the highest level (see present edition, Vol.
22, pp.
205, 207, 302-03).
This makes it easier, after the victory of the socialist revolution, for the workers’ and peasants’ state to take over the basic means of production and organise planned production in the interests of the people.
p.
56 7Lenin refuted the apologetic inventions about the “democratisation” of capital as far back as 1902.
He conclusively showed that indi-vidual workers acquiring small shares do not become owners of joint-stock enterprises, “propertied” people.
The ones who profit from the issue of small shares are the big shareholders of the capi-talist monopolies and joint-stock companies—they use for their enrichment even the very small crumbs of the people’s savings (see present edition, Vol.
6, p.
94).
p.
61 8In the Notebooks and Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, Lenin exposes the bourgeois-apologetic nature of “organised capi-talism”, an unscientific theory that seeks to prove that imperialism is a special, transformed capitalism which has abolished competition, anarchy of production and economic crises, and has achieved planned economic development.
This theory, advanced by the ideologists of monopoly capitalism—Sombart, Liefmann, etc.
—was seized upon by Kautsky, Hilferding and other reformist theoreticians of the Second International.
Lenin demonstrated that monopolies’ rule, far from abolishing, intensifies competition and anarchy of production, and does not rid the capitalist economy of crises (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
208).
p.
62 9In his study of imperialism, Lenin showed that political reaction in all aspects of home and foreign policy is the political superstruc-ture of monopoly capitalism.
Imperialism, he pointed out, is the negation of democracy in general (see present edition, Vol.
23, p.
43).
Monopoly capitalism curtails or nullifies even formal bourgeois de-mocracy, and establishes its unlimited dictatorship.
The characteristic features of imperialist foreign policy are aggression, violation of the national sovereignty of weak and depend-ent countries.
p.
69 10The National City Bank (from 1955 First National City Bank of New York)—United States’ third largest bank and the centre of a financial-monopoly group embracing large industrial and financial corporations.
p.
79 11All the data refer to 1910, except those for Switzerland (1908), and for Hungary and France (1909).
p.
85 12Bankruptcy statistics—statistics insolvent debtors.
13Lenin used these data in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capi-talism (see present edition, Vol.
22, pp.
239-40).
In the Notebook of proceedings taken against p.
86the world total of securities, 815,000 million francs, is given for 1911, and in Imperialism, for 1910.
Lenin took the figure from Zimmer-mann’s “International Statistics of Securities and Stock Issues”, which cites as its source a survey by Alfred Neymarck, who gives the figure as referring to January 1, 1911.
p.
95 14The petty-bourgeois American economist Henry George (1839-1897) maintained that the chief and universal cause for the division of the population into rich and poor was expropriation of the land from the people.
Poverty was thus due to the land monopoly, and it could be eliminated, he declared, by the bourgeois state nation-alising the land, leasing it to individuals and using the rent for social needs.
In reality bourgeois land nationalisation does not undermine the foundations of capitalism, but assists its develop-ment, and does not save the working people from poverty and ruin.
Of the “declamations of Henry George” and similar petty-bourgeois doctrines, Karl Marx wrote: “The whole thing is thus simply a social-istically decked-out attempt to save capitalist rule and actually re-establish it on an even wider basis than its present one.
” (See Marx’s letter to Sorge, June 20, 1881, and Engels’s preface to the American edition of his Condition of the Working Class in England.
) p.
98 15Proudhonism—an unscientific, anti-Marxist variety of petty-bour-geois socialism deriving its name from the French anarchist Pierre Joseph Proudhon.
Proudhon criticised big capitalist ownership from a petty-bourgeois standpoint and dreamed of perpetuating small private ownership.
He proposed the formation of a “people’s” bank and an “exchange bank”, through which the workers could acquire their own means of production and ensure the sale of their product at a “fair” price.
Proudhon did not understand the role and significance of the proletariat, rejected the class struggle, the social-ist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.
An anarchist, he denied the necessity for the state.
The Proudhonists idealised small-scale commodity production and exchange.
“Not abolishing capitalism and its basis—commodity production—but purging that basis of abuses, of excrescences, and so forth; not abolishing exchange and exchange value, but, on the contrary, making it ‘constitutional’, universal, absolute, ‘fair’, and free of fluctuations, crises and abuses—such was Proudhon’s idea” (see present edition, Vol.
20, p.
34).
The new Proudhonism is how Lenin described the reformist theo-ries of the Kautskyites, who depicted the dominance of the monopo-lies and banks, the omnipotence of the financial oligarchy, colonial plunder, annexations and other intrinsic features of imperialism as accidental excrescences on capitalism, and concocted all manner of plans for “reconstructing” capitalism, removing monopoly “abuses”, etc.
Lenin exposed the reactionary nature of such theo-ries, whose proponents “want to go ‘back’ to small capitalism (and not towards socialism)” (see p.
93 of this volume).
p.
11616Kautsky’s theory of ultra-imperialism (super-imperialism)—an opportunist theory of a new phase of imperialism—“internationally united finance capital”—that would lead to an organised world economy, with imperialist contradictions abolished, by agreement between the capitalist countries.
Lenin exposed the real social meaning and purpose of this “theory”, which whitewashes and seeks to perpetuate imperialism.
He described it as “a most reaction-ary method of consoling the masses with hopes of permanent peace being possible under capitalism, by distracting their attention from the sharp antagonisms and acute problems of the present times, and directing it towards illusory prospects of an imaginary ‘ultra-imperialism’ of the future.
Deception of the masses—that is all there is in Kautsky’s ‘Marxist’ theory” (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
294).
Kautsky’s theory of “ultra-imperialism” is repeated in different versions by latter-day apologists of imperialism.
It finds expres-sion in all manner of bourgeois and reformist projects for a world capitalist state with a single government, and so forth.
(For Lenin’s criticism of Kautsky’s anti-Marxist theory, see present edition, p.

17The figures on German iron output, written by Lenin in the margin, are from a table in the January 1911 issue of Die Bank (p.
95), in an item headed: “Iron and Steel Industry after 100 Years”.
Lenin quotes part of the table on p.
184 of this volume, under the heading “Recent Statistics on the Iron Industry”.
p.
183 18The data on the relations between finance capital and the govern-ments, and Lenin’s comments on them, were further developed in Imperialism, and other writings.
Lenin showed that the develop-ment of monopoly and finance capital inevitably leads to a small group of industrial and financial magnates—a financial oligarchy— playing a decisive part in the economy and politics of the capitalist countries, the bourgeois state, too, being wholly subordinated to it.
The monopolies subordinate and use the state machine by putting representatives of the government on their boards of directors and by having their own representatives enter capitalist govern-ments.
This has become a regular practice.

S.

183 19Nietzsche, Friedrich (1844-1900)—reactionary German philosopher, one of the ideologists of agrarian-bourgeois reaction.
His works reveal him as a bitter enemy of democracy, the working class and Marxism.
Nietzsche viewed social and political problems from the standpoint of subjective idealism and vulgar “social-Darwinism”, the theory of the “superman”.
Its anti-democratic, reactionary character made Nietzscheism the accepted philosophy of fascism.
Bourgeois ideologists widely use his theories to present impe-rialism as a social system that accords with “human nature”, to justify aggression and extol predatory wars.

21, p.
33).
In his well-known article “On the Slogan for a United States of Europe”, published August 23, 4915, Lenin wrote that “a United States of Europe, under capitalism, is either impossible or reaction-ary” (ibid.

Similar ideas were expressed in the Draft Programme of the Revolutionary-Socialist Association and Social-Democratic Labour Party of Holland, in the American Socialist Labour Party, and in other parties.

24723Engels in Anti-Dühring, Part II, Chapter III, “The Force Theory (Continuation)”, writes as follows about the capitalist states: “The army has become the main purpose of the state, and an end in itself; the peoples are there only to provide soldiers and feed them.
Militarism dominates and is swallowing Europe.
But this militarism also bears within itself the seed of its own destruction.
Competition among the individual states forces them, on the one hand, to spend more money each year on the army and navy, artil-lery, etc.
, thus more and more hastening their financial collapse; and, on the other hand, to resort to universal compulsory military service more and more extensively, thus in the long run making the whole people familiar with the use of arms, and therefore enabling them at a given moment to make their will prevail against the war-lords in command.
.
.
.
At this point the armies of the princes become transformed into armies of the people; the machine refuses to work, and militarism collapses by the dialectics of its own evolution”.
p.
248 24Manchesterism (Free Trade)—a trend of bourgeois economic policy which advocated freedom of trade and non-interference by the state in private economic activity.
It arose in England at the end of the eighteenth century; in the thirties and forties of the ninete-enth century the main support of Free Trade came from the industrial bourgeoisie of Manchester; hence the Free Traders were also called Manchesterites.
The Manchester school was headed by Cobden and Bright.
Free Trade tendencies in the era prior to monopoly capitalism also struck root in Germany, France, Russia and other capitalist countries.
Free Trade was theoretically substantiated in the works of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.

N.
I.
Bukharin was also a member of the editorial board.
The only (double) issue, which appeared in September 1915, contained three articles by Lenin: “The Collapse of the Second International”, “The Voice of an Honest French Socialist” and “Imperialism and Socialism in Italy” (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
205-59, 349-56, 357-66).
Lenin drew up the plan for the magazine in the spring of 1915.
He intended to make Kommunist an international organ of the Left Social-Democrats.
However, serious disagreements soon arose between the editors of Sotsial-Demokrat and Bukharin, Pyatakov and Bosh, and became more acute after the first issue was published.
In view of the anti-Party attitude of this group, the Sotsial-Demo-krat editorial board, on Lenin’s proposal, decided that It was impos-sible to continue the magazine.

The first three items in the notebook occupy pages 1-10, the pages devoted to Riesser are separately numbered 1-16.
Accordingly, in the summary plan for his book on imperialism, Lenin uses the signs “ϑ ” and “ϑ Ρ ” followed by the page number to denote mate-rial in this notebook.
p.
333 29In the Notebooks and in Imperialism, Lenin repeatedly refers to Hilferding’s book Finance Capital.
While drawing on its factual data in discussing particular aspects of monopoly capitalism, Lenin criticises the author for his non-Marxist propositions and conclusions on cardinal problems of imperialism.
Lenin describes Hilferding— a prominent German Social-Democrat and Second International leader—as a Kantian and Kautskyite, a reformist and “persuader of the imperialist bourgeoisie” (see p.
613 of this volume).
By divorcing politics from economics, Hilferding gives an incorrect definition of imperialism and finance capital; he glosses over the decisive role of the monopolies under imperialism and the sharpening of its contradictions; he ignores such important features of impe-rialism as the division of the world and the struggle for its re-divi-sion, and the parasitism and decay of capitalism, thus taking “a step backward compared with the frankly pacifist and reformist Englishman, Hobson” (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
193).
In spite of its serious errors, however, Hilferding’s book played a posi-tive part in the study of the latest phase of capitalism.
p.
333 30Kantianism—the system of views of the eighteenth-century philos-opher Immanuel Kant, elaborated in his works The Critique of Pure Reason (1781), The Critique of Practical Reason (1788) and The Critique of Judgement (1790).
“The principal feature of Kant’s philosophy,” Lenin pointed out, “is the reconciliation of material-ism with idealism, a compromise between the two, the combination within one system of heterogeneous and contrary philosophical trends” (see present edition, Vol.
14, p.
198).
Kant tried to “recon-cile” faith and knowledge, religion and science.
Kantianism has been the philosophy of all manner of opportunists, including the Kautskyites.
Marx and Engels revealed the essential nature of Kantianism; Lenin subjected it to thoroughgoing criticism in his Materialism and Empirio-Criticism (see present edition, Vol.
14, pp.
17-361).
Neo-Kantianism—a reactionary trend in bourgeois philosophy advocating subjective idealism as a revival of Kantian philosophy.
It arose in the middle of the nineteenth century in Germany.
The Neo-Kantians rejected dialectical and historical materialism.
In his book, Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy,Engels described the Neo-Kantians as “theoretical reactionaries” and “cobweb-spinning eclectic flea-crackers”.
The Neo-Kantians advanced “ethical socialism” in opposition to scientific socialism.
Their theory was seized upon by Eduard Bernstein and other revisionists.
Lenin exposed the reactionary nature of Neo-Kantianism and its connection with other trends of bourgeois philosophy (Machism, pragmatism, etc.
).
p.
334 31Lenin points out the falsity of Hilferding’s assertion about Tugan-Baranovsky’s “merit” in explaining the significance of Marx’s theory of capitalist reproduction and crises.
A bourgeois economist and prominent representative of “legal Marxism” in the nineties, Tugan-Baranovsky distorted and sought to refute Marx’s theory.
He denied the basic contradiction of capitalism and the resulting contradiction between the urge for continual expansion of production and restricted consumption owing to the proletarian state of the masses, and maintained that unlimited accumulation and unhin-dered expansion regardless of the consumption and living standards of the masses was possible.
Now, too, bourgeois economists disse-minate similar apologetic theories.
Capitalist reality refutes these vulgarised doctrines and completely confirms the correctness of the Marxist theory of capitalist accumulation and crises.
p.
336 32By the First World War, the Thyssen Steel Company, founded in 1871, was Europe’s biggest iron and steel complex—it included the entire metallurgical cycle, plus coal and iron mines, general engineering and munition plants, transport and trading enterprises.
In 1926, the Thyssen family played a leading part in the formation of the Steel Trust—the largest German war-industry combine and one of the most powerful German monopolies.
The Thyssen concern helped bring the nazis to power; it was closely connected with a number of industrial and banking monopolies in nazi Germany and with international monopoly capital.
After the Second World War the Steel Trust was split into two large concerns—Thyssen and Rheinstahl.
The Thyssen concern holds a leading place in the West German iron and steel industry.
Hugo Stinnes started a steel mill in 1893; after the First World War it grew into a large monopoly concern with more than 1,500 en-terprises in different industries.
The concern went bankrupt shortly after Stinnes’s death in 1924, but with the help of American banks his heirs managed to keep the concern in business.
One of its off-shoots, the Rhein-Elbe Union steel combine, became one of the main components of the Steel Trust.
Control of the Stinnes concern passed to the Hugo Stinnes Corporation, a U.
S.
company in which the shares are held by Stinnes’s heirs and American bankers who heavily invested in the concern.

In going though the extracts, Lenin underlined some passages, wrote comments and made notesin the margin.

His underlining is shown by the following type variations: a single underlining—italics; a double underlining—s p a c e d i t a l i c s ; t h r e e l i n e s —s m a l l h e a v y i t a l i c s ; a s i n g l e w a v y l i n e — C A P I T A L L E T T E R S ; a double wavy line— S P A C E D C A P I -T A L L E T T E R S .
All Lenin’s additions have been set in a heavy face; where these were once underlined—h e a v y i t a l i c s , where twice underlined—s p a c e d h e a v y i t a l i c s.
In the preface to Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism, Lenin pointed out that he had made use of the book by J.
A.
Hobson with all the care it merited.
John Atkinson Hobson (1858-1940) was a well-known British economist, whose point of view was that of a bourgeois reformist and pacifist.
The best-known of his writings are Problems of Poverty, The Evolution of Modern Capitalism and Imperialism.
Lenin described the last-named as the “principal English work on imperialism” and a typical example of the petty-bourgeois criticism of imperialism.
Lenin points out that Hobson’s book “gives a very good and comprehensive description of the principal specific economic and political features of imperialism” (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
195).
In the Notebooks on Imperial-ism, Lenin writes that “Hobson’s book on imperialism is useful in general, and especially useful because it helps to reveal the basic falsity of Kautskyism on this subject” (see p.
116 of this volume).
While making use of Hobson’s rich factual data, Lenin criticised his reformist conclusions and his attempts, albeit veiled, to defend imperialism.

These are followed in the notebook by a number of extracts from pp.

473 41In the preface to the French and German editions of Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism Lenin particularly mentions the importance of data on the world’s railways for a characterisation of monopoly capitalism: “The uneven distribution of the railways, their uneven development—sums up, as it were, modern monopol-ist capitalism on a world-wide scale” (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
190).
The railway statistics quoted in this volume on pp.
484-90 and 492-95 show how Lenin collected and analysed extensive data on railway development in different countries (Great Powers, independent and semi-independent states, and colonies) in 1890 and 1913.
Comparing these data with figures of iron and coal output, Lenin revealed the disproportion between the development of the productive forces and railway construction in various countries (as a result of colonial monopoly).
The results of his study, summarised in two short tables, are given in Chapter VII of Imperialism (see present edition, Vol.

It was closed by the nazi government in March 1933 and resumed publication in April 1946.

506 43King Leopold II of Belgium (1835-1909) resorted to intrigue, vio-lence and bribery to take possession of a vast territory on the Congo River (1879-84).
The Berlin Conference of 1884-85 endorsed its conversion into the personal property of Leopold II under the title of “the Congo Free State”.
Its conquest was accompanied by savage atrocities towards the African tribes.
In 1908 Leopold “ceded” his personal rights to the Congo to Belgium, at great profit to him-self, and it became a Belgian colony.
Capitalist monopolies— Belgian, British, French and others—were complete masters of the country.
Merciless capitalist exploitation led to repeated anti-imperialist actions by the people, which were brutally suppressed by the colonialists.
Under pressure of the national liberation move-ment, independence was proclaimed on June 30, 1960, but foreign monopolies’ domination continues.

46International Socialists of Germany (Internationale Sozialisten Deutschlands)—a group of German Left-wing Social-Democrats who during the First World War united round the magazine Licht-strahlen (Rays), published in Berlin from 1913 to 1921.
Without wide contacts with the masses, the group quickly fell apart.
The Internationale group—a revolutionary organisation of German Left Social-Democrats, founded at the beginning of the First World War by Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring, Clara Zetkin, Julian Marchlewski, Leo Jogiches (Tyszka), and Wilhelm Pieck.
In April 1915 Rosa Luxemburg and Franz Mehring started the magazine Die Internationale, which united the main Left Social-Democrat forces.
At the All-German Conference of Left Social-Democrats in Berlin on January 1, 1916, the organisation was formalised and the name Internationale Group adopted.
In 1916, in addition to the political leaflets it had been issuing, it began illegal publication and distribution of “Political Letters” signed “Spartacus” (they came out regularly until October 1918), and the group began to be called the “Spartacus” group.
The Spartacists conducted revolutionary propaganda among the masses, organised mass anti-war demonstrations, led strikes and exposed the imperialist nature of the world war and the treachery of the opportunist Social-Democratic leaders.
However, they com-mitted serious errors in matters of theory and tactics.
In April 1917, the Spartacists joined the centrist Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, but preserved their organi-sational independence.
During the November 1918 German revo-lution, the Spartacists broke with the Independents and formed the Spartacus League, and on December 14, 1918 published their programme.
At the Inaugural Congress (December 30, 1918-Janu-ary.
1, 1919) the Spartacists founded the Communist Party of Germa-ny.
Lenin repeatedly criticised the errors of the German Left Social-Democrats and pointed to their inconsistency, but he highly valued their revolutionary work.

It embraced mainly unskilled or semi-skilled workers in various industries.
Daniel De Leon, Eugene Debs and Bill Haywood, prominent figures in the American labour movement, had an active part in its form-ation.
The I.
W.

organised a number of successful mass strikes and anti-war demonstrations during the First World War.
Some of its leaders, notably Bill Haywood, welcomed the Great October Socialist Revolution and joined the U.

activities had a strong anarcho-syndicalist tinge: it rejected proletarian political struggle, denied the leading role of the revolutionary workers’ party and the need for proletarian dictatorship.
Owing to the opportunist policy of its leadership, the I.
W.
W.
degenerated into a sectarian organisation and rapidly lost influence in the labour movement.
The Socialist Party of America was formed in July 1901 at a con-gress in Indianapolis by a merger of break-away groups of the Socialist Labour Party and the Social-Democratic Party, one of whose founders, Eugene Debs, had an active part in organising the Socialist Party.
In the First World War three trends developed in the Socialist Party: the social-chauvinists, who supported the government’s imperialist policy; the Centrists, who opposed the imperialist war only in words; and the revolutionary minority, who took an internationalist stand and waged a struggle against the war.
The Socialist Party Left wing headed by Charles E.
Ruthenberg, William Z.
Foster, Bill Haywood and others, and supported by the Party’s proletarian elements, fought the opportunist leadership and campaigned for independent working-class political action and for industrial trade unions based on the principles of the class struggle.
The Socialist Party split in 1919; the Left wing withdrew from the party and became the initiator and main nucleus of the Communist Party of the U.
S.
A.
The Socialist Party is now a small sectarian organisation.

52The Socialist Labour Party of America was founded in 1876 at a Unity Congress in Philadelphia by a merger of the American sec-tions of the First International and other socialist organisations.
The Congress was held under the guidance of F.
A.
Sorge, long-standing associate of Marx and Engels.
The bulk of the party consisted of immigrants largely unassociated with the American-born workers.
In the early years, the party leadership was dominat-ed by the Lassalleans, who committed errors of a sectarian and dogmatic nature.
Marx and Engels severely criticised the American Socialists for their sectarian tactics.
In the nineties the leadership passed to the Left wing, headed by Daniel De Leon.
However, they committed anarcho-syndicalist errors.
The S.
L.
P.
repudiated the struggle for partial working-class demands, rejected work in the reformist trade unions, and gradually lost whatever ties it had with the mass labour movement.
In the First World War it tended towards internationalism.
Under the influence of the October Socialist Revolution in Russia, its more revolutionary section took an active part in forming the Communist Party.
At present the S.
L.
P.
is a small organisation without any influence in the labour movement.
The American Federation of Labour (A.

)—America’s biggest trade union centre, founded in 1881.
Organised on craft principles, it united mainly the “labour aristocracy”.
Its official organ, the monthly journal American Federationist, began to be published in Washington in 1894.
The reformist leadership of the A.
F.

612 62During the First World War Trotsky pursued a Centrist policy and supported social-imperialists.
Lenin regarded Centrism as the most harmful and dangerous variety of opportunism, for masked opportunists are a hundred times more harmful and dangerous for the working-class movement.
Led by Lenin, the Bolsheviks waged an implacable struggle against Centrism and its Trotskyist variety.
Exposing the real nature of the Trotskyist slogan “neither victory nor defeat” Lenin pointed out that he who supports this slogan in the present war, “is consciously or unconsciously a chau-vinist”, “an ‘enemy’ of proletarian policy”, a supporter of the bour-geoisie (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
279).

Two numbers appeared: No.
1, January 1916, and No.
2, April 1916.
The official publishers were Henriette Roland-Holst and Anton Pannekoek.
Lenin took an active part in organising the magazine and—after publication of the first issue—in arranging its translation into French so as to ensure a wider readership.
Lenin’s articles, “Opportunism and the Collapse of the Second International” and “The Socialist Revo-lution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination (Theses)”, were published in its pages.

625 69Grütli-Verein—a bourgeois reformist organisation founded in Switzerland in 1838, long before the organisation of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party.
The name is derived from the Union of Grüt-p.
604lians (conspirators), who rose against the Austrian oppression in the sixteenth century.
In 1901 the Grütli-Verein affiliated to the Swiss Social-Democratic Party, but remained organisationally independ-ent.
Its newspaper, Grütlianer, followed a bourgeois-nationalist policy.
In the First World War, the Grütli-Verein took up an extreme chauvinist position and became the mainstay of the Right-wing social-chauvinists.
In November 1916, the Zurich Congress of the Swiss Social-Democratic Party declared that the Grütli-Verein’s social-chauvinist activity was incompatible with member-ship of the Social-Democratic Party.

Two request cards filled in by Lenin establish the approximate date of his work on this book.
He made his request for the book on August 4, 1916; the library answered that it could supply it “towards the end of October”.
On October 4, 1916, Lenin asked for another (1908) edition and received the same answer.
The time of his work on the book can be put as October-November 1916.

731 88August Bebel’s article, “Deutschland, Russland und die orienta-lische Frage” (“Germany, Russia and the Eastern Question”), was published in 1886 in Die Neue Zeit (4th year, No.
11).
Lenin appar-ently read it in connection with a lecture by the Bundist Kosovsky (M.
Y.
Levinson).
The lecture was delivered between October 10 and 20, 1914 (see Lenin Miscellany XIV, p.
132).
p.
732 89In the later part of October 1915, Lenin proposed to deliver lectures in Zurich and Geneva: “On the 22nd in Zurich, on the 20th in Geneva”—he wrote to V.
A.
Karpinsky in Geneva (see Lenin Miscellany XI, p.
184).
The lecture in Zurich, “The International Socialist Conference of September 5-8, 1915”, was delivered on Octo-ber 23.
Concerning the date of the Geneva lecture, Lenin wrote: “If possible, fix it for two days before or after” (ibid.
, p.
185).
The subject of the Geneva lecture was, evidently, decided upon somewhat later: “I shall write about the lecture tomorrow” (letter to Karpinsky, October 6; ibid.
, p.
189).
The conspectus, “Imperial-ism and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination”, apparently relates to the Geneva lecture delivered by Lenin on October 28, 1915.
p.
735 90Lenin described the Zimmerwald Conference of internationalist socialists (September 1915), as a “first step” in the development of the international movement against the imperialist war.
Social-ists from eleven European countries, including Russia, Germany, France and Italy, took part.
The Conference Manifesto was directed against the imperialist governments that had unleashed the world war, and condemned, although not strongly enough, the social-chauvinists.
On the basis of the Manifesto, the Zimmerwald group was formed.
The Zimmerwald Left, led by Lenin, took shape at the Confer-ence.
It sharply criticised the Kautskyite majority of the Confer-ence and proposed that the resolutions call for a complete break with social-chauvinism and for revolutionary struggle of the masses against their imperialist governments.
The Zimmerwald Left elected a Bureau which after the Con-ference continued to work for unity of the revolutionary interna-tionalist forces.
p.
739 91Struvism, “legal Marxism”—a bourgeois-reformist distortion of Marxism.
P.
B.
Struve and other “legal Marxists” tried to use Marxism and the working-class movement in the interests of the bourgeoisie.
Lenin described Struvism in the following words: “Struvism is not merely a Russian, but .
.
.
an international striving on the part of the bourgeois theoreticians to kill Marxism with ‘kindness’, to crush it in their embraces, kill it with a feigned acceptance of ‘all’ the ‘truly-scientific’ aspects and elements of Marxism e x c e p t its ‘agitational’, ‘demagogic’, ‘Blanquist-utopian’ aspect.
In other words, they take from Marxism all that is acceptable to the liberal bourgeoisie, including the struggle for reforms, the class struggle (without the proletarian dictatorship) the ‘general’ recognition of ‘socialist ideals’ and the substitution of a ‘new order’ for capitalism; they cast aside ‘only’ the living soul of Marxism, ‘only its revolutionary content” (see present edition, Vol.
21 p.
222).
During the First World War, Struve was one of the ideologists of Russian imperialism; under cover of Marxist phrases he tried to justify the predatory war, annexa-tions and the enslavement of small nations by the Great Powers.

p.
754 95“Imperialism and the Split in Socialism” was written by Lenin in October 1916 and published in December 1916 in Sbornik So-tsial-Demokrata No.
2 (see present edition, Vol.
23, pp.
105-20).
p.
754 96Lloyd-Georgism was the name Lenin gave to the system of methods employed by the bourgeoisie to win over the broad masses, “a sys-tem of flattery, lies, fraud, juggling with fashionable and popular catchwords, and promising all manner of reforms and blessings to the workers right and left—as long as they renounce the revolu-tionary struggle for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie” (see present edition, Vol.
23, p.
117).
Lenin named this system after the Brit-ish political leader and Prime Minister David Lloyd George (1863-1945), whom he described as “a first-class bourgeois manip-ulator, an astute politician, a popular orator”, who served the bourgeoisie well, bringing its influence to bear among the prole-tariat and giving sops to docile workers in the shape of minor reforms.
p.
756 97“Theses on Imperialism and National Oppression”, signed by the editorial board of Gazeta Robotnicza were published in No.
2 of the magazine Vorbote, from which Lenin made his summary.
Gazeta Robotnicza (Workers’ Gazette)—illegal organ of the Warsaw Committee of the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania, published from May to October 1906; 14 issues appeared under the editorship of G.
Kamensky, after which publi-cation ceased.
After the split in the Polish Social-Democratic Party in 1912, two Warsaw Committees were formed and two organs were published under the same name, Gazeta Robotnicza; one by the supporters of the Chief Executive Committee in Warsaw (July 1911-July 1913), the other by the Opposition Warsaw Commit-tee in Cracow (July 1911-February 1916).
Lenin refers to the latter.
Gazeta Robotnicza supported the Zimmerwald Left and took an internationalist stand on the war.
But on a number of important issues (organisational break with the Centrists, attitude to the minimum programme during the war) it leaned towards Centrism.
On the national question, its editorial board opposed national self-determination.
Lenin discusses this in his “Letter from the Committee of Organisations Abroad to the Sections of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
” (see present edition, Vol.
22, pp.
157-60).
On the Gazeta Robotnicza theses, see also Lenin’s article “The Discussion p.
757 on Self-Determination Summed Up” (ibid.
, pp.
320-60).
98This item, apparently, is a plan for an article or several articles on the revolutionary Marxist attitude versus the opportunist atti-tude towards imperialism.
The beginning of the plan corresponds to the text of “Imperialism and the Split in Socialism” (see present edition, Vol.
23, pp.
105-20).
To bring out the connection between imperialism and opportunism, Lenin critically analyses, in the plan and the article, the attitude of Kautsky, the outstanding spokesman of opportunism.
He reveals “the inseparable historical connection between social-chauvinism and opportunism, as well as the intrinsic similarity of their political ideology” (ibid.
p.
105).
Lenin used only part of the plan in writing “Imperialism and the Split in Socialism”.
That is suggested by the concluding sentence of the article: “In the next article we shall try to sum up the principal features that distinguish this [Marxist—Ed.
] line from Kautskyism” (ibid.
, p.
120).
p.
758 99The reference, apparently, is to the errors of Wilhelm Liebknecht (vacillations towards national-liberalism) in 1864-70, when the bourgeois-democratic revolution in Germany was in its concluding stage, and the Prussian and Austrian exploiting classes were trying to devise a method of completing the revolution from above.
Lenin pointed out that “Marx not only rebuked Lassalle, who was coquett-ing with Bismarck, but also corrected Liebknecht, who had lapsed into ‘Austrophilism’ and a defence of particularism; Marx demand-ed revolutionary tactics which would combat with equal ruthless-ness both Bismarck and the Austrophiles” (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.
78, and also pp.
119 and 308).
The Mensheviks and other national-liberals tried to make use of Wilhelm Liebknecht’s errors to justify their chauvinist stand during the imperialist war of 1914-18.
p.
758 100Analysing the development of opportunism in the international Social-Democratic movement, Lenin demonstrated the inevita-bility of its transformation into social-chauvinism during the imperialist war of 1914-18.
In “Opportunism and the Collapse of the Second International” he showed that the opportunism of the years 1889-1914 and the social-chauvinism of the period of the First World War have the same class basis and the same political content, namely, alliance of the servitors to the bourgeoisie and the big capital against the working class, class collaboration, repudiation of revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.
“Social-chauvinism is the direct continuation and consummation of British liberal-labour politics, of Millerandism and Bernsteinism” (see present edition, Vol.
22, p.
112).
p.
759 101Millerandism—an opportunist trend named after the French socialist Millerand, who in 1899 joined the reactionary bourgeois government of France and helped the bourgeoisie carry out its policy.
p.
759102Bernsteinism—an opportunist trend in international Social-Democracy which arose at the end of the nineteenth century and de-rived its name from the German Social-Democrat Eduard Bernstein.
In articles published in 1896-98 in Die Neue Zeit, the theoretical organ of the German Social-Democratic Party, and in his book The Premises of Socialism and the Tasks of Social-Democracy (1899), Bernstein came out against the Marxist theory of class struggle, the inevitable collapse of capitalism, against the socialist revo-lution and proletarian dictatorship.
He urged Social-Democrats to confine themselves to achieving reforms that would improve the workers’ economic position under capitalism.
Bernstein’s opportunist and revisionist views were supported by the Right wing of the German Social-Democratic Party and of other Second International parties.
Only the Bolshevik Party, headed by Lenin, resolutely fought Bernsteinism and its adherents and successors.
In characterising one trend of opportunism and social-chauvinism, Lenin uses Engels’s appraisal of the British Labour Party as a “bourgeois labour party”.
In “Imperialism and the Split in Socialism”, Lenin states that a “bourgeois labour party” is in-evitable and typical in all imperialist countries, and that “‘bour-geois labour parties’, as a political phenomenon, have already been formed in all the foremost capitalist countries” (see present edition, Vol.
23, p.
118).
