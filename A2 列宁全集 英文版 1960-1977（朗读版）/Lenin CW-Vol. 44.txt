The documents relating to this period demonstrate Lenin’s many-sided activity in building up the new, Soviet machinery of state and ensuring its smooth running, guid-ing economic and cultural development, and organising the defence of the country.
In these documents Lenin gives directives for defeating counter-revolutionary revolts, ensuring revolutionary order, and defending the world’s first proletarian dictatorship.
They show Lenin as the organiser and inspirer of the vic-tories over the interventionists and whiteguards.

Sokolnikov, and many other documents, are exam-ples of Lenin’s activity in leading the struggle against foreign and domestic counter-revolution and guiding the military activities on the fronts of the Civil War.
Volume 44 publishes a letter of Lenin’s to the Central Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) dated June 17, 1919, which, like a number of other documents, shows that he regarded the Central Committee of the Party as the body for collec-tive leadership of the country’s defence.
Lenin set aside Trotsky’s objections to the Central Committee’s decision to strengthen the General Headquarters, and wrote that this de-cision contained “what Trotsky overlooked, namely, that the majority of the C.
C.
is convinced that .
.
.
all is not well at Headquarters, and in seeking a serious improvement, in seeking ways for a radical change it has taken a definite step” (p.
255 of this volume).
In response to Lenin’s call, many of the country’s in-dustrial cities sent their best Communists and non-Party workers to the decisive fronts of the Civil War.
Lenin constantly followed the progress of mobilisation and the training of reserves for the Red Army.
In a letter to the Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern Front re-commending a group of Ivanovo-Voznesensk Communists Lenin requested that they should be allocated correctly and carefully.
“I particularly ask to be informed of the receipt of this letter,” he wrote, “and of where and how the com-rades are assigned” (p.
302).
Situated as it was in a hostile capitalist encirclement, the Soviet Republic experienced extreme difficulties.
The documents in this volume contain much material on Lenin’s leadership of the foreign policy of the Soviet state and show his exceptional perspicacity and profound understand-ing of the alignment of forces in the international arena.
It was only thanks to the tremendous efforts of Lenin, in a stubborn struggle of the Party against Trotsky and the opposi-tional group of “Left Communists” that the peace treaty with Germany was signed at Brest-Litovsk on March 3, 1918.
Its conclusion was a striking example of the wisdom and flexibility of Lenin’s tactics, and his ability to frame the solely correct policy in an extremely complicated situation.
The signing of the Brest peace and the struggle against the “Left Communists” are dealt with in the letter to Major-General S.
I.
Odintsov on November 15 (28), 1917, the note to Karl Radek on January 14 (27), 1918, the radio-telegram to the peace delegation on February 25, 1918, the telegram to Irkutsk on February 27, 1918, and other documents.
The Soviet Government headed by Lenin consistently pursued a policy of peace advocated peaceful coexistence of states with different social systems.
When the imperial-ists of the Entente began their anti-Soviet armed interven-tion, the Soviet state repeatedly addressed proposals forpeace to the governments of the United States, Great Britain and France.
In the letter to G.
V.
Chicherin and L.
M.
Ka-rakhan on October 10, 1918, Lenin wrote: “Regarding the Note to Wilson, I think it should be sent.
Write it in detail, politely, but caustically, saying: in any case we con-sider it our duty to propose peace—even to governments of capitalists and multimillionaires—in order to try to stop the bloodshed and to open the eyes of the peoples” (p.
152).
The Soviet Government’s readiness to enter into peace negotiations with the leaders of the Entente Powers is also stressed in Lenin’s letter of May 6, 1919, to Chicherin and Litvinov.
Letters to Krasin, Litvinov, Chicherin, and others are devoted to the establishment of trade and economic relations with the capitalist countries.
Among them are letters on the negotiations with W.
B.
Van-derlip, a representative of American business circles (see pp.
423, 442).
In one of the letters, Lenin wrote: “trade agreements with the Soviet Republics are more advan-tageous to the British bourgeoisie than unprofitable and even ruinous attempts to crush them” (pp.
404-05).
Published in this volume is a considerable number of documents showing Lenin’s activity in the most diverse fields of the socialist economy: putting the work of nationalised enterprises on a proper footing, organising financial affairs, the utilisation of the co-operative movement for supplying the population, the development of agriculture, the organi-sation of communes and artels.
The volume contains Lenin’s letters elaborating and clarifying the basic principles of the single economic plan endorsed by the Ninth Congress of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
).
A num-ber of letters are devoted to propaganda for the electrifi-cation of the country.
Lenin was interested in the coal deposits of Bryansk District, the oil of Ukhta, Berchogur and Cheleken, the exploitation of shales, the use of peat as a basis for electrification.
He attached very great signifi-cance to the development of engineering, to the speediest introduction of up-to-date achievements in the national economy, to making wide use of scientists and experts.
There are documents showing Lenin’s interest in the Nizhni-Novgorod Radio Laboratory, which was in fact one of the first scientific research institutes.
In the note to N.
P.
Gorbunov on October 21, 1918, Lenin wrote: “I earnestly request you to speed up as much as possible the Science and Technology Department’s findings in regard to the Radio Laboratory.
It is extremely urgent.
Drop me a line when its findings are ready” (p.
156).
The telegram to the Porokhovo District Soviet on July 2, 1919, the letters to N.
A.
Semashko on May 3, 1920, and to A.
I.
Rykov and I.
I.
Radchenko on October 28, 1920, and other letters, are indicative of Lenin’s attitude to inventions and inventors.
Lenin pointed out that scientists must play a leading part in applying scientific knowledge to the national econo-my and making use of scientific achievements.
The present volume publishes Lenin’s letter to Gorky of September 15, 1919, in which he said that the Soviet government highly valued scientists who had resolved to devote their knowledge and labour to the people.
He wrote: “To the ‘intellectual forces’ who want to bring science to the people (and not to act as servants of capital), we pay a salary above the average.
That is a fact.
We take care of them.
That is a fact” (p.
285).
At the same time he explained to Gorky that the Soviet Government was compelled to take severe measures against those who were involved in counter-revolutionary conspiracies and revolts, which threat-ened the lives of tens of thousands of workers and peasants.
Lenin repeatedly pointed to the need to put science and ideology at the service of the new socialist order.
He sharp-ly criticised the views of the ideologists of Proletcult who oppugned the leading role of the Soviet state and the Party in cultural matters.
Everything connected with raising the cultural level of the working people claimed Lenin’s atten-tion: the abolition of illiteracy, questions concerning litera-ture, the quality of mass publications, the development of libraries, radio broadcasting, the cinema, etc.
One of the main tasks of education during the first years of Soviet rule was the liquidation of illiteracy.
“.
.
.
The struggle against illiteracy is a task more important than any other,” he wrote in August 1920 (p.
413).
Lenin attached great importance to propaganda and agitation.
On receiving a letter from a “group of students interested in communism”, he wished them “most speedy success in your study of communism, mastery of it, andcommencement of practical work in the ranks of the Rus-sian Communist Party” (pp.
147-48).
Lenin devoted much attention to the realisation of his plan for “monumental propaganda”, for decorating the streets of Moscow and Petrograd with revolutionary inscriptions on buildings and with monuments to outstanding leaders of the revolutionary movement and culture.
The Party and government exerted tremendous efforts to rescue the country from the grip of economic chaos and famine.
In the letter to A.
G.
Shlyapnikov on May 28, 1918, Lenin wrote: “The Central Committee has passed a decision to direct the maximum number of Party workers to the food front.
For obviously we shall perish and ruin the whole revolution if we do not conquer famine in the next few months” (p.
95).
The letter to the Commissariat for Food and to the Food Department of the Supreme Eco-nomic Council, the note to the secretary, the telegram to Kharkov and Moscow, the letter to V.
A.
Antonov-Ovseyen-ko and G.
K.
Orjonikidze, the telegram to S.
V.
Malyshev, the telegram to the Revolutionary Military Councils of the 10th and 4th armies, the letter to the Agricultural Section of the Food Department of the Moscow Soviet, and the telegram to the Podolsk Uyezd Food Committee reflect Lenin’s activities in the business of supplying food for the Red Army and the population of the industrial centres.
“Petrograd and Moscow are without grain.
Heroic meas-ures needed.
Wire exact reply immediately,” wrote Lenin to V.
A.
Radus-Zenkovich; Chairman of the Saratov Gubernia Executive Committee, on July 11, 1919 (p.
263).
“At all costs provide all workers of the Urals, particularly the Ekaterinburg district, Kizel and other coal-mining districts, with full supplies of essential foodstuffs,” was Lenin’s instruction to the civil and military authorities of Perm and Ekaterinburg in November 1919 (p.
311).
He gave special attention to supplies for children.
Supporting the proposals for ensuring food for children, Lenin wrote to Tsyurupa “Perhaps something more could be done for the children? It should be” (p.
188).
The letters show how Lenin’s principles of Party and state leadership were worked out, and characterise his style of work.
Lenin attached immense importance to collective leader-ship.
As the documents in this volume show, on all impor-tant matters he consulted his colleagues and other leading workers and submitted these questions to the Central Com-mittee or the Council of People’s Commissars for consider-ation and decision.
“I cannot go against the will and decision of my Council colleagues,” he emphasised in a letter to Maria Andreyeva (p.
69).
At the same time Lenin considered it essential that collective leadership should be duly combined with the personal responsibility of each worker for the task entrusted to him.
On August 26, 1918, he wrote to A.
P.
Smirnov: “I very much fear that you in Saratov are playing at collegiate methods at a time when the work demands energy and prompt action by res-ponsible executives.
.
.
” (p.
142).
Lenin severely criticised all manifestations of localism, anarchy, indiscipline, or the refusal of one or another staff member to submit to instruc-tions from higher organisations.
He taught the executives of administrative and Party bodies to be business-like, quicker on the move in taking decisions, to be able to concentrate attention on the most important task and see each job through to the end.
A number of documents show Lenin’s efforts to strengthen revolutionary, socialist legality.
In the note to the Commis-sariat for Justice on April 15, 1918, be stressed the need for codification, for publishing a Collection of Laws and Decrees of the Soviet Government, for expanding propa-ganda on matters of law among the population, and for drawing the mass of working people into the work of the People’s Courts.
He pointed to the need for a determined struggle against embezzlement of state property, profiteer-ing and hooliganism; he proposed severe measures of punishment for bribe-takers.
Lenin demanded that all Soviet bodies and all the personnel of the state apparatus should strictly observe the laws in force in the Republic.
He wrote that the mere suggestion to evade a decree should entail prosecution by the courts.
Lenin was quick to react to any information signalising a violation of socialist legality, he issued directives for a deeper study of individual cases, and took vigorous steps to stop responsible workers abusing their official position.
The Communist Party of Soviet Russia acted as a great patriotic and international force.
Lenin closely followed the events in Hungary and endeavoured to hearten the Hungarian Communists, who were encountering great dif-ficulties.
In a letter to Bela Kun, he wrote: “We are aware of Hungary’s grave and dangerous situation and are doing all we can.
.
.
.
Hold on with all your might, victory will be ours” (p.
271).
“The communist movement in all coun-tries is growing remarkably.
The Soviet system has every-where become a practical slogan for the working masses.
This is a step forward of tremendous world-historic signifi-cance.
” These were the words with which Lenin greeted the Dutch Communists in October 1919 (p.
291).
He wrote to Raymond Robins on April 30, 1918: “I am sure the new democracy, that is, the proletarian democracy, is coming in all countries and will crush all obstacles and the impe-rialist-capitalist system.
.
.
” (p.
82).

In view of the extreme urgency of this matter, I would earnestly request you to get your group together at once, tomorrow morning, and to send me tomorrow evening at least a brief outline of the main problems, points and pro-visions of an armistice agreement (demarcation of the front line, stipulation that no troops be moved to other fronts, control measures, etc.
, etc.
), and also to indicate the person or persons who would be fully competent to take part directly in the negotiations.
Please send me a reply by messenger.

(B.
) The Hanecki affair On the question of Hanecki, the narrow C.
C.
has passed a decision not to appoint him as representative in Stock-holm.
That is to say, it rescinded the previous decision of the C.
C.
I propose that this decision be countermanded on the following grounds.
What are the arguments against Hanecki? He is known since 1903; a member of the Polish C.
C.
who worked for many years as a C.
C.
member; we saw his work in Cracow, his trips to Russia, etc.
, we saw him at all congresses, etc.
, etc.
The arguments are merely a campaign of bourgeois slanders, Zaslavsky’s outcries.
It would be quite unworthy of a workers’ party to show such credulity to intellectualist scandal.
Let someone prove anything bad about Hanecki first, before we remove him.
“But Hanecki traded with Parvus,” they “all” say.
Hanecki earned his living as an employee in a commercial firm of which Parvus was a shareholder.
That is what Hanecki told me.
It has not been refuted.
Is it forbidden to work in capitalist commercial under-takings? Where? By what decision of the Party? Are there no people among us who work in commercial firms of Russian, British and other capitalists? Or is it permissible to be a technician, a manager or an employee of Russian capitalists, but not of German, even when living in a neutral country?? And is that to be the decision of an “internationalist” party?? Let it decide frankly, let it pass a general resolution, let it give grounds for the step taken against Ha-necki.
When Bukharin wanted to go and work in Parvus’s busi-ness as a writer, we dissuaded him, for after all it is not a commercial firm.
But while we dissuaded him, we did not denounce the Mensheviks 6 in Parvus’s employ.
We did not denounce Zurabov and a host of others, we did not accuse them.
Who accused them, and where? Why is it that up to now we have not questioned the Mensheviks and others who lived in Copenhagen and knew of Hanecki’s commercial occupation and who did not con-demn him? We could and should have done that.
Not a single fact against Hanecki has been established, no ban has been passed on being employed in capitalist commercial firms of all countries, no check has been made on the rumours and slanders of notorious slanderers like Zaslavsky—yet the man is to be “removed”?? There is nothing here but “fear” of the slanders of irresponsible slanderers.
It is unworthy of a working-class party to be so credu-lous of scandal.
If the comrades who succumb to scandal are “perturbed”, “worried”, why shouldn’t they exert them-selves a little? Isn’t it better to take some pains to find the truth than to repeat scandal? In Petrograd itself it is possible (if a perturbed comrade wants to go to same trou-ble and not decide things offhand) to find witnesses from Copenhagen, and in Moscow too.
Why don’t the anonymous accusers of Hanecki in the ranks of our Party do that??Such treatment of an absent comrade, who has worked for more than ten years, is the height of injustice.

We are very grateful to you for the exchange of ideas and for the very accurate infor-mation on the socialist movement in France.
I very much regret that personal relations between us became impossible after such profound political differences divided us.
Throughout the war I fought against the “national defence” trend, I always stood for a split, being convinced that that tendency was ruining socialism com-pletely.
It goes without saying that I am writing this letter not as a member of the government but as a private individual.
Please accept our greetings, dear citizen, and best wishes from my wife and myself.

DZERZHINSKY 4/III (19/II).
1918 Comrade Dzerzhinsky, The bearer, Sidorenko, was my personal secretary for some days.
I was quite satisfied with him.
He was dis-missed on account of an incident when, being drunk, he shouted, as I have been informed, that he was “Lenin’s secretary”.
Sidorenko tells me that he deeply regrets it.
And per-sonally I am inclined to believe him; the lad is young and, in my opinion, very good.
One must be lenient to youth.
On the basis of all these facts, judge for yourself, and see what place you can find for him.

I cannot go against the will and decision of my Council colleagues.
Just now it is absolutely impossible for me to have a talk with you, as I cannot tear myself away.
I will write you about the case of the “provocateur and black-mailer” (obviously he was a blackmailer: Kartashov has long been in prison, I have made inquiries).
I beg you to excuse me.

ORJONIKIDZE Comrade Sergo, I beg you to pay serious attention to the Crimea and the Donets Basin with a view to creating a united fighting front against invasion from the West.
Impress upon the Crimean comrades that the course of events makes defence imperative for them and that they must defend themselves irrespective of ratification of the peace treaty.
Make them realise that the position of the north is substantially differ-ent from that of the south, and in view of the war, the actual war of the Germans against the Ukraine, help on the part of the Crimea, which (the Crimea) the Germans can gobble up in passing, is not only an act of neighbourly duty, but a requirement for self-defence and self-preserva-tion.
It is possible that Slutsky, failing to grasp the com-plexity of the present situation, has taken some other, simplified line of his own—in which case he must be put in his place in my name.
Immediate evacuation of grain and metals to the east, organisation of demolition groups, the creation of a united front of defence from the Crimea to Great Russia, drawing in the peasants, a decisive and unqualified transformation Ukrainian-wise of our units in the Ukraine—these are the present tasks.
Antonov should be forbidden to call himself Antonov-Ovseyenko—he must call himself simply Ovseyenko.
The same applies to Mura-vyov (if he remains in his post) and others.
As regards the Donets Republic, tell Comrades Vasil-chenko, Zhakov and others that however much they may contrive to keep their region apart from the Ukraine, it— judging from the geography of Vinnichenko—will all the same be included in the Ukraine and the Germans will proceed to conquer it.
In view of this, it is quite absurd for the Donets Republic to refuse a united defence front with the rest of the Ukraine.
Mezhlauk was in Petrograd and he agreed to recognise the Donets Basin as an autono-mous part of the Ukraine; Artyom has also agreed to this; therefore the obstinacy of some comrades from the Donets Basin takes on the appearance of an entirely inexplicable and harmful whim which is absolutely impermissible in our Party midst.
Bring this home to the comrades of the Crimea and Don-bas, Comrade Sergo, and get a united defence front set up.

KUIBYSHEV BY DIRECT LINE Kuibyshev, Chairman of the Soviet of Deputies, on the line in Samara Comrade Lenin, Dutov’s forces have again become active in Oren-burg; a report has been received that Cossack detachments are advanc-ing within twenty versts of Orenburg.
Iletsk is encircled by Cossacks.
The Cossacks are mobilising all the villages; they are committing terrible atrocities, three members of the Executive Committee, and Zakharov, Chairman of the Cossack Section of the Soviet, have been killed.
The bourgeoisie of Orenburg is actively participating.
Oren-burg requests the Council of People’s Commissars to help uproot this Dutov adventure, otherwise there will again be a blockage, which will cause the death through famine of 12,000,000 inhabitants of Tur-kestan.
One detachment sent from Orenburg to Iletsk was surrounded and wiped out to a man; government commissar Tsvilling is believed to have been killed.
Samara will strain all efforts to help Orenburg, but the local forces are insufficient to liquidate Dutov’s bands com-pletely; help from the centre is essential.
I have finished and await a reply.
I shall take all steps immediately to notify the military authorities and give you assistance.

Please confirm this to the bearer and give him a brief statement that you will grant such detachments the fullest plenary powers on precisely such conditions.

In order that appropriate instructions may be given to the military authorities, we inform you that our envoys are in Kharkov at the present moment, headed by Sytin, military commander of the Bryansk General Staff units, who has been given instructions to secure a general truce on the Voronezh and South-Eastern fronts.
A truce, especially on the South-Eastern (Don) Front, must be secured as quickly as possible, in the last resort agreeing even to accepting as a basis the present disposition of military forces.
Sytin has been instructed to try to secure through the medium of the German Command direct contact with our Command on the South-Eastern Front for co-ordinated action.
With the same aim in view, the Supreme Military Council, by all the means available to it, should maintain constant contact both with Sytin and with our Command on the South-Eastern Front.

A point about the participation of 20-50 workers in each commis-sariat of the grain-producing gubernias may be inserted, but it should be for their participation in the technical apparatus as cadres to be sent out to the volosts.
The introduction of such a number of workers in the composition of the commissariats will evoke protests in the local areas.

All this should be set out and published in greatest detail and in an extremely popular manner.

MENZHINSKY 24/V.
1918 Comrades Joffe and Menzhinsky Dear Comrades, I have received your pessimistic and angry letters (that of 20.
V, I received today, 24.
V).
Some of your accusations levelled against Chicherin fall on me.
For example, I in-sisted that the theses on concessions should be sent through * Delegatkoms—delegate committees under the gubernia food committees, consisting of delegates from army units, representatives of the consuming districts and others.
—Ed.
the Germans, in order to show them how seriously we de-sire business-like economic relations.
(The theses were drawn up by common consent with the participation of Radek and other “Left stupids”.
) The terms of our concessions are such that nothing but benefit for us will result if the Germans accept these terms.
I fully approve your policy, set out in especial detail in Comrade Joffe’s letters, Your dissatisfaction with Chicherin is, in my opinion, exaggerated.
But in any case I agree to help you and I ask you to direct your efforts to practical ways of improving matters.
For this, I would suggest that you precisely for-mulate concrete proposals (send me copies of telegrams and letters, parts that are strictly practical and brief, for I simply have no time to read everything).
In that case I promise to try to secure their fulfilment and to check whether they have been fulfilled.
You must think over how to shift the centre of things to Berlin to a greater extent (I agree to help in this), and propose for this purpose very tactful (N.
B.
) and concretely practical measures.
I shall accept all feasible measures and endeavour to have them carried out.
If anything can be done to secure peace with Finland, the Ukraine and Turkey (this is the crux of the matter), we must always work for this (of course, it cannot be secured without certain further annexations and tribute payments).
I would give much to hasten such a peace.
You, too, should keep your nerve.
Putting diplomacy to rights (and creating a new diplomacy) is no easy task.
Fes-tina lente.
With best greetings, Yours, Lenin P.

I missed the messenger.
Chicherin has given me the text of a Note which Joffe sent to the German Government on his own account, agreeing to surrender the ships of the Black Sea Fleet (i.
e.
, to their removal from Novorossiisk to Sevastopol) 60 on conditionmerely of peace with the Ukraine.
However, our govern-ment in a clearly worded Note (communicated by radio to Joffe as well) considered it possible to agree to the re-moval of the ships to Sevastopol on different conditions, viz.
: 1) peace on all three fronts, i.
e.
, with the Ukraine and Finland and Turkey; 2) no annexation of Sevastopol.
How could Joffe make such a mistake? How could he make such a “bad bargain”? How in general he could send a Note on such an important question on his own account, I fail to understand.

3 3 , September 8 , 1 9 1 8 Printed from the text of Bulletins 91 TELEGRAM TO THE KINESHMA SOVIET 63 Soviet of Deputies Kineshma To all workers of the Kineshma district.
Comrade workers, the rich in the villages of the producing gubernias are hoard-ing huge stocks of grain and not giving them up for the starving workers.
The rich prefer to sell grain at exorbitant speculative prices, which only the city bourgeoisie can pay, but not the poor, starving population.
While specu-lating in grain, the rich seek to speculate also in the goods they receive in exchange for grain.
The city bourgeoisie is agitating for the abolition of the grain monopoly and fixed prices, and for freedom to trade in grain.
The bour-geoisie is passing from agitation to provocation; it is skil-fully and surreptitiously inciting the starving workers to demonstrations, disturbances and disorders, while endeav-ouring to seize power in its own hands.
The Council of People’s Commissars is exerting every effort in the strug-gle to uphold the grain monopoly, in the absence of which only the bourgeoisie will prosper while the poor will be left without any grain at all.
Comrade workers, do not give way to the provocation of the dark forces, do not play into the hands of the bourgeoisie and the counter-revolu-tionaries who want to make cat’s-paws of you and destroy all the gains of the revolution.
Do not disorganise the hard work of obtaining grain for you by thoughtless actions on your part and independent exchange of goods.
The Council of People’s Commissars is now exchanging goods for grain on a vast scale; it has begun requisitioning grain stocks from the village bourgeoisie by means of armed detach-ments.
If you want to help, to co-operate with your workers’ and peasants’ government, act in an organised way: select from among you those who are most familiar with the food business for work in the Soviet food supply bodies, recruit fighting detachments of honest, incorruptible, steadfast revolutionaries, true champions of the interests of the work-ers and peasants.
Immediately detain provocators and agents of the counter-revolution and deliver them to Moscow.
Bear firmly in mind: either we extricate ourselves from all our unprecedented difficulties in an organised way, and with honour, or everything is inevitably doomed to complete ruin.
There is no other alternative.
In the expec-tation of speedy results from these measures, the Council of People’s Commissars asks you, comrade workers, to dis-play revolutionary self-discipline and political alertness in order to save the gains of the revolution and ensure the triumph of the proletarian dictatorship.

JOFFE 2/VI.
1918 Comrade Joffe, Sokolnikov and Bukharin are to make a trip to you, and Larin, too, I believe.
67 I take this opportunity to give you a little warning.
I am sitting at a meeting with the “travellers” (without Larin).
I hear talk about “Joffe trans-ferring the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs to Berlin”.
The friction between you and Chicherin is sometimes used—unconsciously rather than consciously—as a means towards intensifying this friction.
I am confident that you will be on your guard and will not allow this friction to grow.
I have read attentively your letters and I am absolutely convinced that this fric-tion is unimportant (there is chaos everywhere, careless-ness everywhere—in all commissariats—and this evil is slow to cure).
Given patience and persistence the friction will be smoothed over.
Chicherin is a splendid worker.
Your line is quite faithful to the Brest treaty, you are al-ready successful, I think—and hence it follows that we shall easily smooth away the friction.
If the German traders will accept economic advantages, realising that nothing is to be got from us by war, for we shall burn everything—then your policy will continue to be successful.
We can give the Germans raw materials.
In important cases, send me copies of your exact demands.
Arrange for a direct line as quickly as possible.
Bukharin acts in good faith, but he is up to the neck in “Left stupidness ” .
Sokolnikov has gone astray again.
Larin is a floundering intellectual, a first-class bungler.
Therefore be extremely on your guard with all these most charming, most admirable delegates.
Sokolnikov is a very valuable worker, but sometimes (as just now) something “comes over him” and he “breaks china” because of para-doxes.
If you do not take precautions, he will break china there with you.
And Bukharin—triply so.
Prenez garde! I hope that Krasin and Hanecki, being business-like peo-ple, will help you and the whole matter will be smoothed out.
Thank you for the “supplement” to your letter.
I await some more.

But you, workers, should not believe the whiners, sow-ers of panic and fault-finders, but set to work: let every factory send to our aid trust-worthy people with a guarantee, with a surety, we shall show them where the obstacle lies, what the difficulty is, and they will help us.

STALIN Secret People’s Commissar Stalin Tsaritsyn Today, June 30, information was received from Joffe in Berlin that Kühlmann had a preliminary conversation with Joffe.
From this conversation it is evident that the Ger-mans agree to compel the Turks to cease hostilities beyond the Brest frontier, having established a precise demarca-tion line for us.
They promise not to allow the Turks into Baku, but they want to receive oil.
Joffe has replied that we shall adhere strictly to Brest, but quite agree with the principle of give and take.
Pay the greatest attention to this information and try to pass it on as soon as possible to Shahumyan, for now there are very serious chances of holding on to Baku.
Some oil, of course, we shall give.

JOFFE 1 VII.
1918 Dear Comrade Joffe, I am, to tell the truth, extremely angry with you.
We are short-handed, everyone is devilishly overworked, yet you go and do a thing like this: you write a lot on business matters in a personal letter to me (the last one, in pencil) and insert a number of personal thrusts, attacks, pinpricks and so on against Chicherin (“not a real” m-r * and so on).
To Chicherin, on the other hand, you write: “prospects in the letter to Lenin”.
Damn it, it’s the frozen limit! Chicherin, naturally, asks me for the letter, and I can’t show it, because I don’t want to be an instrument of squab-ble.
The result is that the work suffers and relations suffer.
Chicherin is a splendid worker, most conscientious, shrewd, knowledgeable.
Such people should be highly appreciated.
That his failing is lack of “commandership ” does not matter.
There are plenty of people in this world who have the opposite failing! Chicherin is a man you can work with, he is easy to work with, but the work can be spoiled even with him.
You find fault with him, but the Commissariat for For-eign Affairs has a right to complain of you, too, because you do not reckon with him, and without the knowledge and permission of the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, ambassadors are not, of course, entitled to take decisive steps.
I hope you will take all measures to eliminate these Mißstände.
** That you have got Krasin “on the move” is very good.
Keep on at Shklovsky with all your might; he is a lazy-bones; demand reports and more reports, use threats.
All the best, Lenin Sent to Berlin First published in 1 9 5 9 in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI * Apparently “minister”.

KRASIN Secret Personal from Lenin to Krasin Russian Embassy, Berlin I fully appreciate Joffe’s work and certainly approve it, but I emphatically demand that Joffe should behave as an ambassador whose superior is the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, and should observe the decencies, not abusing and not slighting other people, and consulting the People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs on all important matters.
Only then can I and will I support Ambassador Joffe.
I rely on your tact to impress this upon Ambassador Joffe, and await a reply.

MEKHONOSHIN 78 Lenin replies: Kolegayev told me personally as well as Zinoviev and many others, that he, Kolegayev, is opposed to the present policy of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party.
I do not doubt that the crazily hysterical and provocative adventure culminating in the murder of Mirbach and revolt of the Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries against the Soviet power will lose them not only the major-ity of their workers and peasants, but also many intellec-tuals.
The revolt was suppressed completely in a single day.
Hundreds of people have been arrested.
Put on record Muravyov’s declaration of his withdrawal from the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party, and continue to keep him under vigilant control.
I am confident that if these conditions are observed we shall fully succeed in utilising his excellent fighting qualities.
The struggle against the Czechoslovaks and Cossacks must be waged with treble energy.

1918 Comrades Kobozev, Danishevsky, Mekhonoshin and Raskolnikov Comrades, I take this opportunity to send you a few words by mes-senger.
Are the army commanders and Vatsetis working vigor-ously enough? Is the commissars’ control over them good enough? What are the opinions about Blokhin? Is it true that he is splendid? If so, is he being given enough scope? Of course, I am judging from a distance and can easily be mistaken.
But I am afraid lest the “staffs” should smoth-er the live work below, the work of the masses? Is there sufficient contact in the military field with the masses of poor peasants? Is everything being done to rouse them and draw them into the work? Now the entire fate of the revolution rests on one card: swift victory over the Czechoslovaks on the Kazan-Urals-Samara front.
Everything depends on this.
Is the command sufficiently energetic? Is the offensive sufficiently vigorous? Please reply, if only in a few words, both by telegraph and by messenger.
Regards, Lenin First published in 1 9 3 4 in the journal Proletarskaya Revolutsia No.

1918 Comrade Joffe Everything you write in your recent letters is the height of absurdity.
To pursue the “former” policy of not breaking with the Entente after the Onega events is ludicrous.
8 5 You can’t restore chastity to a dame with a baby.
It is also absurd to apply the term intervention or aid to the fact that we are continuing to manoeuvre, allowing the Germans to take what the Entente has already taken, thereby making more difficult and delaying the Anglo-American-Japanese throttling of Russia.
Without knowing the facts and without reflecting on them, you have fallen into error with the memorandum and the rest.
If you wish to insist on it, hand in your resigna-tion to the C.

This is impermissible.
Panyushkin must be given a strictly defined, precise assignment, laid down in writing (1) to seize and requisition all grain surpluses from the kulaks and the rich of the whole Tula Gubernia; (2) to dispatch all this grain immediately to Moscow; |||| (3) no other job whatsoever to be undertaken until this |||| |||| assignment has been completely fulfilled.
For carrying out the work use as many motor-lorries as possible.

TSYURUPA Tsyurupa Every effort must be made now so that in actual fact both decrees (on harvesting detachments and on collective trains) are merged in practice and provide us with our detach-ments.

BRYUKHANOV AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF THE FOOD COMMISSARIAT Bryukhanov and other members of the Board of the Food Commissariat I gather from your note that the Food Commissariat understands and applies the decrees incorrectly.
“No special desire is noticeable among the workers .
.
.
” (to join harvesting detachments).
Where are the proofs? Where is the appeal of the Food Commissariat? What is the date of it? In which factories was it distributed? When and in how many copies? I am afraid the Food Commissariat did none of these things (judging by Comrade Bryukhanov’s silence), but occupied itself with the devil knows what bureaucraticred tape.
For without the help of the workers the Food Com-missariat is nil.
Nothing bad is to be seen from the quotation (from Nev-sky’s telegram of 8.
VIII), for it does not touch on the question of % of trade union members, or of the leading organisation, or of participation and harvesting (§ 7 of the decree on collective trains), i.
e.
, the business questions are not dealt with.
What’s bad about Nevsky’s telegram besides the good? Nevsky calls on the workers: go out and help (he says noth-ing about conditions, but we indicated these conditions and indicated good ones).
But the Food Commissariat cavils at a word (when there’s nothing to cavil at) .
.
.
and itself does nothing! Either we rouse the mass of the workers to join in a se-rious movement for grain (and for crushing the kulaks)— this the Food Commissariat does not do —or else, no Food Commissariat at all is needed.

What about having one or two food officials sent to each railway junction? What more can be done? (2) Draft of a decree—25-30 hostages from among the rich in each grain-producing volost, answering with their lives for the collection and delivery of all surpluses.
(3) Instruct Popov urgently to make up delivery orders by volosts.
That is, how much surplus grain there should be in each volost.
How much should each give? 2 Tsyurupa 1) You have not replied about “hostages”.
2) When will Popov finish his work? (He must be given a short time limit.
) 3 I propose that “hostages” should not be taken but des-ignated by name for each volost.
The purpose of designating them: it is the rich peasants who, in the same way as they answer for contribution, will answer with their lives for the prompt collection and delivery of grain surpluses.
An instruction to this effect (to designate “hostages”) to be given (α) to the Poor Peasants’ Committees, (β) to all food detachments.

Further, it is absolutely essential to sweep clean of all grain surpluses first one volost, and to give that volost a big bonus.
We shall not grudge money to help the poor and middle peasants, if they are helping the hungry.

Tell all members of the Executive Committee and all Communists that it is their duty ruthlessly to suppress the kulaks and to confiscate all the grain of the insurgents.
Your inactivity and weakness is exasperating.
I demand detailed reports on the fulfilment of all my orders and es-pecially on the measures of suppression and confiscation.

Soviet power exists in the Northern Cauca-sus.
Its troops are cut off from Tsaritsyn, which is be-sieged from the south by the Cossacks.
The British have landed in Baku and the situation there is unstable.
The Germans have agreed to guarantee there will be no offensive against Baku if we drive out the British from there.
Howmatters will turn out there is not known.
As regards the military aid, we do not know where it is.
We think it is held up near Tsaritsyn.
* As regards ambassadors and consuls, we advise a waiting attitude, keeping them under threefold surveillance and arresting suspicious individuals who are in contact with them.
We are considering and preparing some assistance for you, but cannot promise anything for certain, for every-thing depends on whether we shall be successful in driving the British out of Baku or whether they succeed in capturing a part of the Caspian coast.

1918 Dear Comrade Joffe, I received your letter of 13.
X after sending off a let-ter to you.
I am not against continuing the “diplomatising”.
But its importance has diminished.
The whole point is wheth-er the Entente manages to land in force in the Black Sea.
I have long been talking to everyone everywhere about this danger, and have said it clearly in the letter to the Central Executive Committee.
115 The radical difference from II.
1918 is that at that time we had a chance to win time by giving away territory.
Now there is no such chance.

Dear Berzin, I have received a lot of books from you.
Many thanks.
I hear that all are at loggerheads over there.
We shall take Shklovsky and Zalkind.
In case of anything, write; I shall sign your orders (to your subordinates), so that they will not dare quarrel and will strictly carry out your orders.
Stay in bed and follow the treatment strictly; you ought to be living not in Berne, but in the mountains in the sun-shine, in some place where there is a telephone and a rail-way, and you should send a secretary to Berne and people should travel to you.
In the German translation of The State and Revolution an unfortunate error has crept in: the postscript is not dated.

VOLIN NOVEMBER 29, 1918 Comrade Volin, Chairman of the Orel Gubernia Executive Commit-tee and Gubernia Party Committee, on the line: I have just received a telegram from Surazh as follows: “On No-vember 29, a congress of German Councils in the Ukraine is taking place at Gomel.
It is essential to send representatives.
We have sent the head of the Information Department, and others.
We are conducting talks with a big German Council in the Ukraine and are enlisting in the Red Army volunteers from the German army.
Send directives for talks to our representatives in the Ukraine.
Our representatives have been guaranteed safety, they are under German protection.
The temper of the German army is thoroughly Bolshevik.
” I decided today to send to Gomel a Communist, Chairman of the Soviet, and a Ger-man, the Communist Meyer, from the International Detachment.
Should the Chairman of the Orel Soviet only make a speech of greet-ings or can he take upon himself a political mission? I am asking you for a directive.
If you know of this congress and have sent your repre-sentatives, then perhaps our delegation is not necessary.
Lenin: I know nothing about this congress.
I advise you to get in touch immediately with the Ukrainian Communists and with their Central Committee via Kursk.
The reports about the majority of the German Councils being on the side of the Bolsheviks must be carefully verified.
If this is not the case, then it is necessary at the congress to deliver a detailed, well-substantiated, principled speech about Bol-shevism and its tasks.
If, however, the German soldiers are already Bolsheviks or Spartacists, then we must propose to them an immediate alliance with us for the speediest restoration of Soviet power in the Ukraine and for the ar-rest not only of whiteguards, but also of the supporters of the Rada.
In any case people must be sent to the congress who are capable of accurately reporting back all the discus-sions and resolutions.
If it is already too late to send new representatives to the congress, then try to wire my note through to the people you have already sent.
I await a reply.
Volin: Vladimir Ilyich, I informed you that I decided to send the Chairman of the Soviet to Gomel.
He is leaving tonight.
That was why I asked for your directive.
Simultaneously with this I shall try to get in touch with Kursk.
Lenin: I am very glad that you are sending the chairman to the congress.
I hope you are satisfied with my sugges-tions.
Arrange for me to get information about each day of the congress.

Start the check discreetly to prevent premature publici-ty and be able to catch them red-handed and expose them completely.
Should the accusation prove to be true, these Black Hundreders must be kicked out publicly and a leaflet about the affair promulgated throughout the volost and uyezd, for the population must be taught that well-founded com-plaints are of great significance and lead to important re-sults.

I hope, nevertheless, you will do everything possible to give Surkov some satisfaction: for example, the right to use it, and so forth.

1919 Trotsky Voronezh or present whereabouts Am very uneasy about whether you are not giving too much attention to the Ukraine to the detriment of the gen-eral strategic task, on which Vatsetis insists and which consists in a speedy, determined and general offensive against Krasnov.
I am very much afraid that we are being late with this and that the recent successes of the Krasnov-ites near Tsaritsyn will again lead to the postponement of our offensive and to our missing the right moment.
The initiative for serious operations is escaping from us, both at Astrakhan and on the Caspian Sea, as well as at Tsa-ritsyn and in the east.
Vatsetis is for a speedy general offensive against Krasnov, but Vatsetis, apparently, is not able to cope with red tape and the separatism of the Ukrain-ians and other regionalists.
Should you not concentrate wholly on hastening and carrying through a general offen-sive against Krasnov? Lenin First published in part in Grazhdanskaya voina.

At the talks it is to be stated clearly straight away that there can be no question of any change in the Soviet Constitution, because Soviet power, being the power of the exploited classes for suppressing the exploiters, has definitely proved its necessity for securing victory over the bourgeoisie, and the Soviet movement is now spreading to all countries of the world.
Continually report directly to us on the whole course of the negotiations, and on the participants of both sides.

The Commissariat for Railways plainly states that there cannot be enough materials for restoring the bridges of both lines.
I fully agree with this decision of the Council of Defence, but if you can perform a miracle by contriving to repair the Povorino-Tsaritsyn line in addition to the Liski-Likhaya line, you will indeed be a miracle worker.

Printed from the original285 RADIO-TELEGRAM TO BELA KUN Bela Kun Budapest I am sending you a copy of our radio-telegram of today to Pichon on the question of the exchange with France.
191 Our Red Cross Commission headed by Manuilsky left for France to organise repatriation of our men, but has been held up.
We promised to repatriate the French servicemen still with us if repatriation of our men from France is or-ganised and proceeds at full speed.
The French Government prevented Manuilsky’s Commission from organising this work.
Of the 35,000 Russian soldiers in France, Africa and Salonica, France wants to repatriate 900 men now and makes empty promises of repatriating our soldiers later on as opportunity offers, but in exchange for this, France de-mands that we should immediately let all the Frenchmen go home.
France wants to send Manuilsky’s mission back together with the 900 Russian soldiers, although nothing has been done to organise further repatriation.
France wants to get everything and give almost nothing and get rid of Manuil-sky.
Yet we are aware that our soldiers who remain in France and refuse to join the army are subjected to the most mon-strous persecution and that Manuilsky has been forbidden to establish any sort of contact with them.
We refuse, on such conditions, to let the Frenchmen go home.
This is the substance of my radio-telegram, a copy of which is being sent to you.
The French will shout blue murder, and tell the Americans every sort of disgusting lie.
Please hand a copy of our Note to the American representa-tive for his government.

We have grain, he says, we also have surpluses.
We have missed the winter period, he says, but after the sowing (which ends at about St.

This, he says, should be utilised.
Information should be collected urgently, at once, and if there is even a slight chance, this measure should be car-ried out, for there will be no consignments from the east.

1919 Gubernia Executive Committee Tambov I enclose a telegram from Tambov.
207 Please arrange another general meeting of these 252 (it is not clear whether they are all the members of the co-operative or only some of them, and if so, out of what total number) and explain the following to them: “The Council of People’s Commissars has passed a decree for the organisation of consumers’ communes in the inter-ests of correct distribution of products.
It is unjust that the distribution of products essential for the whole popula-tion should be handled only by part of the population, as was the case under capitalism.
In all countries the co-operatives under capitalism embrace mainly the upper sections of workers and peasants.
It is essential that now not only the upper sections, but all working people, every one of them, should take part in the distribution of products.
“There is hardly a single one of the great founders of the world co-operative movement who has not pointed to the conversion of this movement into socialism.
Now in-deed this time has come, and all the best elements in the co-operatives are in sympathy with the development of the co-operative movement as envisaged in the decree on the conversion of the co-operatives into consumers’ communes embracing all the working people without exception.
“The members of the consumers’ communes retain the right of fully independent control, as also the right to conduct affairs independently.
This is why I am asking the meeting to revise its decision, to recognise the binding nature of the decree of the Council of People’s Commissars and not to make the workers’ and peasants’ government have recourse to undesirable measures of compulsion.

First published in 1 9 5 9 in Lenin Miscellany XXXVI Printed from the original 313 TO THE PETROGRAD ORGANISATIONS I have had a detailed report from Vatsetis and the Chief of Staff.
The conclusion is a sad one.
Strenuous efforts are needed.
The present enthusiasm must not be allowed to subside, but must be sustained for at least 2 months and still further intensified.
Otherwise we shall not finish the war, and finished it must be at all costs, as signs of weari-ness among the masses (100,000 deserters) are becoming more frequent.
I have discussed the following measures with Trotsky: 1) Some 3,000 Petrograd workers, unfit for war and unarmed, to be sent to the Don.
Purpose—to set things going, to weaken the Cossacks, demoralise them from within, settle among them, set up groups in the villages, etc.
2) All means and resources to be used more and more to get ready a flotilla for the Volga.
Especially repairs.
3) Ditto as regards artillery (without taking away from the Karelian line).
It is necessary again and again to check with the army men whether it is possible to help the east with artillery.
4) Rifles to be collected, especially broken ones (in Tula 800 a day can be repaired; work is lacking).
5) Mobilisation of Petrograd workers to be continued both for the Ukraine and for the Don.
I received a telegram today from Zinoviev on the stop-page of several works, big ones, in Petrograd, owing to oil shortage.
I could not get Krasin on the phone.
When I do I shall tell him.
But I don’t think any oil is or will be available.
I advise moving every one of these workers to the Ukraine, to the Don, to the east, for 3 months.
It is stupid to starve, to perish in Petrograd, when it is possible to win grain and coal.
6) Mobilisation of Party functionaries to be continued, too, especially for places close to the front line.
It is necessary again and again “to rob Petrograd”, that is, to take people from it, otherwise neither Petrograd nor Russia can be saved.
Various branches of administration and of cultural and educational work in Petrograd can and should be weakened tenfold for 3 months.
We shall then save both Russia and Petrograd.
We have no other workers to equal the Petrograders.

LITVINOV 219 Dear Comrades, I am sending you my comments.
In the absence of es-sential differences of opinion, decide for yourselves.
My advice is: use it for propaganda, for clearly it can serve no other useful purpose.
Be extremely polite to Nansen, ex-tremely insolent to Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau.
This is very useful, the only way to speak to them, the right tone.
Lenin 6/V.
I think both replies are quite correct, in proposing a meeting and thanking Nansen.
But it seems to me that the propaganda side should be more fully developed, taking advantage of the fact that the Entente, while easily con-cealing from everyone all other documents of ours, * will be unable, by way of exception, to conceal precisely this reply.
I would therefore advise using for propaganda and ela-borating in greater detail the separation of (α) the humani-tarian and (β) the political aspect.
(α) You mention the humanitarian (it seems, only the humanitarian?) nature of the proposal? For this all thanks and compliments to Nansen personally.
If it’s humanita-rian aims, then do not bring politics into it, dear sir, but just start shipping (stress this).
Just start shipping! We are even ready to pay through the nose for it and wil-lingly admit you for control and give you every guarantee.
Dilate on this, rub it in, make it clear.
Appoint a place and time for the talks! But if a truce, then this is politics! You are an educated man, Mr.
Nansen, you know perfectly well that every war and every truce is politics.
This means you have linked the “humanitarian” with the “political”.
You have lumped them together! Explain to him, as you would to a 16-year-old lass, why a truce is politics.
* The reference is to the numerous official peace proposals addressed to the Entente powers (see present edition, Vol.
30, pp.
191-92).

(β) Is it a good thing—to mix the “humanitarian” with “politics”? No, it is a bad thing, because it is hypocrisy, for which you are not to blame, and it is not you we are blaming.
For one must talk frankly about politics without taking cover behind “humanitarianism”.
And once you have started talking politics, then, by your leave, we are obliged to answer you to the point.
(β 1 ) If the truce is for peace, then you are perfectly aware that we are for it.
We agreed (even!) to the Princes Islands.
We confirmed this to Bullitt who, unfortunately, proved, like the whole of American policy, to be a captive of Cle-menceau and Lloyd George, for what Bullitt promised us, assuring us that America would make Clemenceau and Lloyd George come to heel, remained unfulfilled (it would be useful to “taunt” Wilson about it!).
220 * It was not we who torpedoed the Princes Islands, but the monarchists and anti-Jew pogromists, the restorers of the landowners’ estates.
Explain, develop, prove these three points, that Denikin and Kolchak 1) are monarchists; 2) pog-romist thugs; 3) are restoring the estates of the landowners and introducing redemption payments for the peasants.
We agreed to a truce for negotiations about peace, of course, with those who are really to blame for the war, i.
e.
, with Great Britain, France, America, and not with pawns.
Explain in detail that it is they who are waging war, with their ships, their guns, their cartridges, their officers.
Reveal in detail the outrageously false “renunciation of intervention” in the face of their support (and egging on) of the Estonians, Finns, Poles.
(β 2 ) Further, if the truce is not for peace, but for a polit-ical game—we don’t want it.
Peace is not a joking matter.
No one will succeed in fooling us.
Develop this point, too.
Wind up with a résumé: if it is politics, then we pro-posed a truce for peace, we agreed, we did not torpedo the Princes Islands, we are always ready for talks with those who are really to blame for the war.
* If all are against, throw it out (probably this refers to the text which Lenin put in square brackets.
—Ed.
).
But in my opinion, it is extremely useful in practice to set Wilson at variance with them by declaring that Wilson is a pawn in the hands of Clemenceau and Lloyd George, in submitting to these two, to this “majority”!!If it is not politics, but humanitarianism, we say thank-you, we accept, we invite you to come, to control, and will go anywhere you like (time, place) and will pay even three times the price in timber, ore, ships.
Indeed, we must not miss the opportunity of replying to Nansen in a way that would make good propaganda.

Please do not be diverted from this and send information in code twice weekly—I shall insist on the dispatch to you of what is required, just as I insisted today on an additional telegram about (what has already been ordered three times) the dispatch to you of Communists from Voronezh and Tambov gubernias.
Have done with the revolt quickly at all costs! Yours, Lenin We shall push on also with all our might with migration to the Don from non-agricultural places to get the farmsteads occupied, the rear fortified correspondingly, and so on.

To let Russians out under the guise of foreigners is a counter-revolutionary act, tantamount to treason.
Foreigners in general should not be allowed out without compensation which can only be ordered by the central government.
Citizens of the Entente countries should not be allowed to go, other than by way of exchange carried out by the cen-tral government.
Not a single Frenchman should be allowed to go out until the return of the soldiers from France, among whom there are many Ukrainians.
Those guilty of violating this should be held strictly responsible.
Bear in mind that the Finnish Government, obviously at the instigation of the Entente, is hindering the release to Russia of Russian soldiers; therefore do not allow a single bourgeois, a single person, to leave Odessa and the Ukraine.
Exceptions— Chinese workers, Persians, by orders from the centre.

1919 Rakovsky for Joffe Council of People’s Commissars of the Ukraine Kiev Read this telegram to Rakovsky, Mezhlauk, Voroshilov, Pyatakov, Bubnov, Kviring and other prominent function-aries.
I consider it criminal on your part to have persuaded Trotsky to leave Podvoisky.
Not a single promise is being fulfilled: the Donets Basin has no reinforcements; the mobilisation of workers is pro-ceeding at a disgracefully sluggish pace.
You are per-sonally responsible for the inevitable catastrophe.
All prominent functionaries must be taken off their jobs and installed in Kharkov and Ekaterinoslav for the total mobil-isation of workers; further, one prominent functionary to be sent to each army unit for its advance to the Donets Basin; and everything set in motion for clearing out uni-forms from the stores.
The ruin of the entire revolution is absolutely inevitable unless there is a swift victory in the Donets Basin, for which it is essential to abandon routine in the Ukraine, to work in a revolutionary spirit, to rally all and sundry, to keep an eye personally on each army unit, each step in the work, to set aside everything except the Donets Basin, to have three soldiers to one rifle.
From you not one factual report.

STALIN 237 Zinoviev for Stalin Smolny Petrograd Okulov points to the isolation of the 7th Army from the Revolutionary Military Council of the Western Front, which causes confusion, relieves front workers of respon-sibility, and deprives them of energy in their work.
Petro-grad Military District, subordinated to the Western Front, is giving all its reserves to the 7th Army, not giving them to the front for the remaining armies.
Pozern stays in Petrograd all the time, has poor connections with the Council of the front, and sets up parallel supply bodies instead of utilising the front-line bodies already existing.
Okulov proposes either the complete subordination of the 7th Army to the command of the front, or giving it a special status of direct subordination to the General Headquarters.
Knowing Petrograd’s constant tendency towards in-dependent activity, I think you should help the Revolu-tionary Military Council of the front to unite all the armies.
The other Western armies besides the 7th should be taken care of, too.
Report what you have done.
The conflict with Okulov must not be allowed to grow.
Think it over well, for it is impossible simply to recall him.
Today I learned of the desertion to the enemy of yet another Petrograd regiment and of the refusal of two regi-ments to attack.
Supervision should be strengthened and more workers added.
Regarding foreigners, I advise not to hurry with deport-ation.
Would not a concentration camp be better, so that they can afterwards be exchanged? * Lenin Written on June 3 , 1 9 1 9 First published in 1 9 4 2 in Lenin Miscellany XXXIV Printed from the text in Sklyansky’s handwriting, added to and signed by Lenin * The text of the telegram from the words “The conflict with Oku-lov” is in Lenin’s handwriting.

TROTSKY In code Trotsky Representatives of the Bashkirs have visited me; they ask for their troops to be sent to the east and not to the south.
In the east, in their home territory, they say, they can help capture Chelyabinsk quickly, as the Kirghizes, too, will go with them; but in the south they are powerless and fear they will achieve nothing.
I very much ask you to weigh these arguments, which in my opinion are serious.
Make Sokolnikov hurry with suppression of the revolt.
We are giving Natsarenus to the south.
Podbelsky is work-ing well in Tambov Gubernia, where he has roused the Army Procurements Department and is procuring 20,000 pairs of top-boots.

Shoot those guilty of concealing rifles.
I consider the greatest danger is a possible movement by Kolchak against Vyatka for a break-through to Petrograd.
Pay the most serious atten-tion to this, send information more often about the front at Glazov.
Sklyansky and I are sending reinforcements there, although Muralov is oddly silent and does not himself ask for reinforcements.

Written on September 1 2 , 1 9 1 9 First published in 1 9 4 2 in Lenin Miscellany XXXIV Printed from the original 425 TO MAXIM GORKY 15/IX.
Dear Alexei Maximych, I received Tonkov, and even before that and before re-ceiving your letter we had decided in the Central Committee to appoint Kamenev and Bukharin to check on the arrests of bourgeois intellectuals of the near-Cadet type and to release whoever possible.
279 For it is clear to us that there have been mistakes here, too.
It is also clear that in general the measure of arrest ap-plied to Cadet (and near-Cadet) people has been necessary and correct.
Reading your frank opinion on this matter, I recall a remark of yours, which sank into my mind during our talks (in London, on Capri, and afterwards): “We artists are irresponsible people.
” Exactly! You utter incredibly angry words about what? About a few dozen (or perhaps even a few hundred) Cadet and near-Cadet gentry spending a few days in jail in order to prevent plots like that of the surrender of Krasnaya Gorka, plots which threaten the lives of tens of thousands of work-ers and peasants.
A calamity, indeed! What injustice! A few days, or even weeks, in jail for intellectuals in order to prevent the mas-sacre of tens of thousands of workers and peasants! “Artists are irresponsible people.
” It is wrong to confuse the “intellectual forces” of the people with the “forces” of bourgeois intellectuals.
As a sample of the latter I take Korolenko: I recently read the pamphlet War, the Fatherland and Mankind, which he wrote in August 1917.
Mind you, Korolenko is the best of the “near-Cadets”, almost a Menshevik.
But what a disgusting, base, vile defence of imperialist war, concealed behind honeyed phrases! A wretched philistine in thrall to bourgeois prejudices! For such gentlemen 10,000,000 killed in an imperialist war is a deed worthy of support (by deeds, accompanied by honeyed phrases “against” war), but the death of hundreds of thousands in a just civil war against the landowners and capitalists evokes ahs and ohs, sighs, and hysterics.
No.
There is no harm in such “talents” being made to spend some weeks or so in prison, if this has to be done to prevent plots (like Krasnaya Gorka) and the death of tens of thousands.
But we exposed these plots of the Cadets and “near-Cadets”.
And we know that the near-Cadet professors quite often help the plotters.
That’s a fact.
The intellectual forces of the workers and peasants are growing and gaining strength in the struggle to overthrow the bourgeoisie and its henchmen, the intellectual lackeys of capital, who imagine they are the brains of the nation.
Actually, they are not the brains, but sh—.
To the “intellectual forces” who want to bring science to the people (and not to act as servants of capital), we pay a salary above the average.
That is a fact.
We take care of them.
That is a fact.
Tens of thousands of officers are serving in our Red Army and are winning victory, despite the hundreds of traitors.
That is a fact.
As for your moods, I can “understand” them all right (since you raise the question whether I shall be able to understand you).
Often, both on Capri and afterwards, I told you: You allow yourself to be surrounded by the worst elements of the bourgeois intelligentsia and succumb to their whining.
You hear and listen to the howl of hun-dreds of intellectuals over the “terrible” arrest for a few weeks, but the voice of the masses, the millions, the work-ers and peasants, whom Denikin, Kolchak, Lianozov, Rod-zyanko, the Krasnaya Gorka (and other Cadet) plotters are threatening—this voice you do not hear and do not listen to.
I quite understand, I quite fully understand, that in this way one can write oneself not only into saying that “the Reds are just as much enemies of the people as the Whites” (the fighters for the overthrow of the capital-ists and landowners are just as much enemies of the people as the landowners and capitalists), but also into a belief in the merciful god or our Father the Tsar.
I fully under-stand.
9 No really, you will go under unless you tear yourself out of this environment of bourgeois intellectuals! With all my heart I wish that you do this quickly.
Best regards, Yours, Lenin ! For you are not writing anything! And for an artist to waste himself on the whining of rotting intellectuals and not to write—is this not ruin, is it not shameful?

SKLYANSKY Comrade Sklyansky, The question of reinforcing the division taken from the Eastern Front must be urgently worked up.
Cannot we add to it 20-30% of new recruits? Mobilised workers? Perhaps 5% of Communists, 15% of workers, 10% of peasants? Then it would be augmented by 30%.
Perhaps this is technically admissible (without weakening the whole division as regards toughness)? This must be urgently considered and decided.
Further, the dispatch of rilles to the Eastern Front must now be stepped up.
Should not the Eastern Front be given the following assignment: to consider and carry out a regrouping of the troops so as to reinforce all the divisions by 15-30 per centand thereby bring the whole army up to its previous strength?

1919 Comrades, Comrade Yunosov told me about your case.
I heard him out attentively and reached the conclusion that the case was decided correctly and in your favour, since the person who uttered those thoughtless and profoundly unjust words had been reprimanded.
That is enough.
You are vindicated, he stands accused.
I earnestly request and advise you now to put aside all recollection of it and forget the whole matter.
I am sure that all the workers will now make for the front.
Denikin is pressing hard, the danger is serious.

The Soviet system has everywhere become a practical slogan for the working masses.

Comrade Trotsky, Last night in the Council of Defence we adopted a de-cision of the Council and sent it to you in code (it would be better for you to use your own code, as Karakhan’s, used by Zinoviev, causes a delay of several hours).
As you see, your plan has been adopted.
But the withdrawal of the Petrograd workers to the south, of course, is not rejected (it is said that you expanded on this to Krasin and Rykov); to talk about this prematurely would mean diverting attention from the struggle to the last.
286 The attempt to envelop and cut off Petrograd, of course, will call for corresponding changes, which you will carry out on the spot.
Instruct some reliable person in each department of the Gubernia Executive Committee to collect Soviet papers and documents in preparation for evacuation.
I enclose the appeal which the Defence Council instruct-ed me to draw up.

Trotsky I think that agreement with Estonia against Yudenich is impossible, for she is powerless to do anything even if she wanted to.
Moreover, Yudenich’s base is probably not in Estonia, but outside it, on the sea coast covered by the British fleet.
We have sent you many troops, everything depends on the speed of the offensive against Yudenich and on encircling him.
Strain all efforts to hasten matters.
The huge revolt in Denikin’s rear in the Caucasus 289 and our successes in Siberia raise hopes of complete victory, if we immensely hasten the liquidation of Yudenich.

TROTSKY 18/X.
1919 Comrade Trotsky, I was somewhat taken aback by Zinoviev’s demand yesterday for more regiments.
Is it true about the Eston-ians? Nevertheless, I passed it on to Sklyansky, and an order has been given to have them sent from Tula (again from Tula!).
It is not safe, however, to take any more from the reserves of the Southern Front.
Would it not be better to search elsewhere? It is devilishly important for us to finish with Yudenich (precisely to finish—to deal a final blow).
If the offensive has begun, is it not possible to mobilise another 20,000 Petrograd workers and exert really mass pressure on Yu-denich? If there are 5-10 thousand good attacking troops (and you do have them), then surely a city like Petrograd can give about 30 thousand to follow up, as an aid to them.
Rykov says that a great deal of property has been “found” in Petrograd; there is bread, and meat is on the way.
It is necessary to finish with Yudenich soon; then we shall turn everything against Denikin.
In my opinion it is dangerous to take units from the * The text from the words “so that” to the end is in Sklyansky’s handwriting.
—Ed.
Southern Front now: they have started an offensive there, and it must be extended.
Greetings, Lenin P.

TROTSKY Comrade Trotsky, In my opinion, Chicherin is right.
292 Has it been veri-fied that the Estonians are fighting? Is there not deception here? Or is it not only White Estonians (officers) who have joined Yudenich, people who constitute a minority, and an insignificant one, among the Estonians? We must think it over ten times, measure the cloth ten times, for there is a mass of information pointing to a desire for peace on the part of the Estonian peasantry.

MILYUTIN Supreme Economic Council Comrade Milyutin, Please discuss the drafting of uniform, brief, but essen-tial questions (or forms) for printing periodic reports in Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn on the results of work for the de-velopment of productive forces (the number of employed workers; production, extraction; productivity per worker, etc.
) in all or in the main branches of the economy.
Let me have your opinion.
Lenin The reports must be divided into 2 parts: (a) a part which can only be described (plan, conditions, specific features, etc.
); (b) a part which can and should be expressed in figures.
Both to be published.
In the second part, essentials to be selected (for sum-maries and comparisons).
(Cf.

The local comrades are unfamili-ar with the development and policy of Soviet power and are not ca-pable now of organising them.
Contact with the centre being impos-sible, the absence of suitable leaders in the regions threatens a repetition of stages already passed and an irrational use of Siberia’s natural wealth.
It is essential to send responsible people immediately to the Siberian Revolutionary Committee for political leadership in the fields of Soviet construction and economy.

Greetings, Yours, Lenin First published in 1 9 3 3 in Lenin Miscellany XXIV Printed from the original486 TELEGRAM TO RYAZAN 312 Top priority Telegram to be handed to the duty commis-sar for immediate delivery.
Delivery to be confirmed to Kremlin, Moscow 3 addresses: Gubernia Party Committee, Gubernia Executive Committee, Gubernia Food Committee Ryazan Dear Comrades, At your conference on December 19 you decided to dis-patch 800 truck-loads of potatoes within ten days for Mos-cow workers and outlined a number of measures for carrying this out.
A splendid idea, but the crux of the matter is how successfully and how quickly you will cope with the task you have set yourselves.
The working class of Moscow is in the throes of starvation.
Saving it means saving the revolution.
The working class of Moscow has been bearing the brunt of the struggle against counter-revolution.
The Red Army has defeated Kolchak and Yudenich, it is now Denikin’s turn.
To enable the Red Army, with the least expenditure of time and strength, to cope with this task, which will ensure the possibility of ending the war and beginning peaceful socialist construction, the Moscow work-er has had to make yet another sacrifice.
He has had to provide for operational needs the transport facilities which were intended for the carriage of food to Moscow.
In these conditions, it is natural that localities surrounding the centre of world revolution should come to his aid.
All Party and Soviet personnel should be imbued with the idea that the provisioning of Moscow, the salvation of its work-ing class, is their sacred revolutionary duty.
On your energy and determination depend the gains of the revolu-tion.
All for food procurement, all for work to load and dispatch the trucks.
The dispatch and delivery of food trains to Moscow is the care of the People’s Commissariat for Railways.
Insistently demand fulfilment of this obli-gation from the local bodies of the Commissariat for Rail-ways.
To work, comrades! For speedy, drastic, revolution-ary aid to the Moscow workers! With communist greetings, V.

ZINOVIEV 23/XII.
Comrade Zinoviev, Your letter of 20/XII received.
About Petrograd, arrange everything with Trotsky.
It is evidently necessary to preserve and restore all defence installations (I hear they are already stealing barbed wire, etc.
), and to devise a system of weekly mobilisations (ei-ther “alerts” or musters), in order to keep Petrograd in a state of preparedness.
This must be carefully thought out.
Food supply is at a complete standstill because of trans-port.
Repairs to locomotives and trucks!! About shale, it is splendid that you have already start-ed.
But I was surprised at your writing about the trans-port of shale.
Shale does not stand transport (unless it is for gas: shale is said to yield more gas than coal does), and electricity should be laid on locally and a distillation plant set up on the spot to obtain oil from shale.
That is what I have been told here.
And I thought that Petrograd with all its resources could cope both with the task of electrification and of distillation.
Greetings, Lenin N.

CHICHERIN 4/I.
1920 Comrade Chicherin, Please forward to Litvinov (and if possible, transmit in abridged form by telegraph in code): I have received from him a small batch of pamphlets and newspapers and am extremely disappointed.
The selection has been utterly casual and careless.
Obviously, no one has shown the slightest care in such an important matter as supplying Russia with Western socialist literature.
There are no pamphlets and books by the socialist lead-ers (although their titles and the names of the authors can be found in the Austrian, German, French, Italian and English newspapers).
The newspapers have been so poorly selected that of them is rubbish, while, for example, out of a heap of issues of Freiheit, 321 the really important issues (even the most important, perhaps the only important ones) have been left out, namely, the reports of the Leipzig Congress 322 and the text of the resolutions.
Absolute carelessness, negligence or lack of understand-ing and unwillingness to understand what is needed.
We must have them (Litvinov and all members of the R.
C.
P.
abroad and all “bureaux” and agencies) see to it that people conversant with the literature are engaged in each country (to begin with, Denmark, Holland, etc.
, will suf-fice), their duty being to collect 4-5 copies of every socialist and anarchist and communist pamphlet and book, every resolution, all reports and minutes of congresses, etc.
, etc.
, N.
B.
in all languages.
All to be delivered to Copenhagen, Stock-holm, Vienna, etc.
(to Berlin as well).
Messengers are availa-ble—infrequently, but they are available.
The literature must be collected in good time by employed persons (Rus-sians are slovenly and will never do this meticulously).
It is stupid to grudge money for this.
Ask Litvinov to tell this to Abramovich Kopp Rutgers Bronsky Lyubarsky Reich Ström Z.
Höglund Kilbom Rothstein, etc.
Have 3-5 and more collectors, otherwise we shall never get what is absolutely necessary.

E.
C.
thereby again confirmed the necessity of their most loyal observance of the Bashkir Constitution.
The telegram of the Central Committee sent later to Com-rade Artyom had the same aim.
Under these circumstances I am quite sure that Artyom, Preobrazhensky and Samoi-lov will give no real cause for complications.
The members of the Bashkir Revolutionary Committee should act in the same way.
Only from your telegram did I learn that Com-rades Shamigulov, Izmailov and others were deported from Bashkiria by the Bashkir Revolutionary Committee; the Central Committee thought they were travelling to Moscow on their own initiative to make a report, considered it unnecessary for the five comrades to waste time on the journey and sent them back to Sterlitamak.
Your attempt to deport old Party comrades from Bash-kiria, the absurd reference to their Bukharinist orientation, the persistent, though incorrect, application of the epithet “Ukrainians” to Preobrazhensky, Artyom and Samoilov— give me grounds for doubting your objectivity in this matter.

LUNACHARSKY’S LETTER Comrade V.
I.
Lenin, Chairman of the Council of People’s Com-missars You forwarded me a telegram from Kazan complaining about the lack of currency notes.
I have received similar telegrams from Vyatka and Vologda gubernias.
In all these places, because of the lack of money, teachers have not received salaries for three months.
Thus, it turns out that in the absolutely starving gubernias teach-ers go hungry for lack of foodstuffs, while in the producing guber-nias such as those of Kazan, Vologda and Vyatka, in which teachers in fact could feed themselves, they are starving through lack of money.
I earnestly request you, Vladimir Ilyich, to issue some sort of di-rective or to put this before the Council of People’s Commissars, so that currency notes issued for the needs of the gubernias will be divided proportionately, i.
e.
: where there is a 10-20% shortage, this shortage should be spread among all the departments.
Otherwise.
what happens in practice is that absolutely all, except those engaged in education, receive their salaries.
.
.
.
To the Narrow Council: please put this through.
Even more: it is necessary to give preference to teachers.

Bearing in mind that supplies for the Western Front, Petrograd and Moscow are almost exclusively water-borne, a stoppage in loading, even if only for one day, is impermissible and criminal.
Take measures to prevent any repetition of such facts in future, and urgently report execution to me.

STALIN Comrade Stalin Kremenchug To be handed only personally to Stalin for personal decoding The situation on the Western Front has turned out to be worse than Tukhachevsky and the Commander -in -Chief thought, hence the divisions you asked for must be sent there, but no more can be taken from the Caucasian Front, because there are insurrections there and the position is ex-tremely alarming.
Trotsky is arranging to send you rein-forcements from the Crimean divisions, which may enableyou to take two or three of them for the Kiev direction.
Try to bring up the units and at all costs follow up the offensive with greater vigour.
You, of course, will rem-ember that, by a decision of the Politbureau, the offensive against the Crimea has been halted pending a further de-cision of the Politbureau.

MEREZHIN 403 Comrade Merezhin I think an additional point should be formulated (on the basis of the information of Rafes and others) roughly as follows: The experience of proletarian dictatorship in the Ukraine, especially in those parts of it where there is a mixed pop-ulation, and also in Byelorussia (and & ? &? Hungary?), has shown that national strife not only in the form of po-groms, of which not even the most democratic bourgeois republic is free, but also in the form of petty but all-per-vading squabbling is practically disappearing.
The reasons for this: 1) the interest, attention, and all the intellectual powers of the workers and working peasants are wholly engrossed in the great struggle with the bourgeoisie, a struggle that unites the working people of all nations; 2) the dictatorship of the proletariat suppresses the “freedom” of action of the bourgeoisie, petty bourgeoisie and bour-geois intelligentsia, which freedom signifies the use of their forces, influence and knowledge by the bourgeoisie to in-flame the class struggle.

ZINOVIEV Comrade Zinoviev, Chairman of the Petrograd Executive Committee The famous physiologist, Pavlov, asks to be allowed to go abroad in view of his straitened circumstances.
To have Pavlov leave the country is hardly advisable, since he has previously made statements to the effect that, being a truthful man, he could not, in the event of the subject being brought up in conversations, avoid expressing himself against Soviet power and communism in Russia.
On the other hand, this scientist is such a great cultural asset that his forcible detention in Russia in conditions of material insecurity is unthinkable.
In view of this it would be desirable, by way of escep-tion, to allow him a special ration and in general to en-sure more or less comfortable circumstances for him ex-clusively.
I have heard that in the Petrograd rest homes life is very well ordered for those living there.
Something of the kind could be done for Professor Pavlov at his apartment Comrade Lunacharsky will make the appropriate proposal to Comrade Badayev.

SMIRNOV’S TELEGRAM Lenin Kremlin Moscow Copy to Tsyurupa, People’s Commissariat for Food Omsk, July 9.
Half of the Altai and Tomsk gubernias are in the grip of a kulak movement which we are suppressing by force of arms.
The cause of the insurrection is lack of commodities.
From the insur-gent kulaks we are confiscating grain, the whole of which has not ]] ]] ]] ]] ]] ]] ]] been threshed.
Work hands should be sent out urgently to thresh and load; unless you send workers we shall not be able to take the grain.
A minimum of 7,000 is required at once for the Altai alone.
If you are late, the opportunity will be lost.
Ascertain the possibility and in-form us, if you cannot send them, we shall immediately cancel the order for confiscation, because the kulaks will burn grain that is un-threshed and unguarded.
Smirnov Chairman of the Siberian Revolutionary Committee I insist on all possible help.
Directive from the C.

— make every haste.
We are sending people.

1920 Dear Comrade, Many thanks for the letters, which always contain ex-tremely valuable information.
I enclose a letter from my wife and ask you to give my regards to your wife and fam-ily, whom I met at your home in London.
About your journey to Russia, I am in two minds.
You are so very important for the work in London.
Let them deport you: we shall see if they dare to do so.
They would have to catch you on something, otherwise there will be a row.
I am not against your coming “to take a look” at Russia, but I am afraid that to quit Britain is harmful for the work.
As to the delegation, we shall discuss this in all aspects in a day or so.
The same with the reply to Curzon, 4 2 4 who, in my opinion, wants to grossly deceive us.
He won’t suc-ceed.
About sending you literature, I have taken special meas-ures.
You should know that a Russian has to be sworn at 20 times and verified 30 times to have the simplest thing done properly.
Keep an eye on it and write more often (even sometimes to me)—then I shall push things on so that you get the missing publications more regularly.
I think that your guiding participation (it is possible by the pen and secretly) in the Anglo-Saxon movement is especially valuable.
Here it is highly important to straighten out the line.
You will receive my pamphlet against the “Leftists” * and resolutions (drafts) for the Second Congress of the Third International, and I should very much like to know your opinion.
All the very best, Yours, Lenin Sent to London First published in 1 9 6 5 in Collected Works, Fifth Ed.

The utmost attention must be paid to collecting En-glish writings showing that trade agreements with the So-* This refers to Lenin’s “Left-Wing” Communism—an Infantile Disorder (see present edition, Vol.
31, pp.
17-118).
—Ed.
viet Republics are more advantageous to the British bour-geoisie than unprofitable and even ruinous attempts to crush them.
It is necessary to collect such writings for us, and besides this, to discuss with knowledgeable people whether in addition it would not be expedient to employ some kind of literary bureau or agency for the publication of such pamphlets, for giving lectures, and for their dis-tribution, etc.
You, of course, know whom one should con-sult in the first place about this.
2.
It is necessary to organise through special people the regular collection, purchase, without stinting money, and dispatch to us in 5 copies, of books, articles, pamphlets, newspaper cuttings, particularly in English, but also in other languages, on questions of modern economics.
As an example, Keynes’s Economic Consequences of the Peace.
This is the sort of publication that should be collected syste-matically.
3.
Do the same, but only through special people, for the collection and dispatch to us in 20 copies of periodical publications of all kinds, and especially pamphlets and minutes of the following four trends: 1—communist, 2— Centrist (for example, the Independent Labour Party in Britain), 3—anarchist or near to it, 4—syndicalist, etc.
4.
All this should be properly organised by a legal agreement, through someone who must be a British subject and not a Communist.
5.
Please send me personally: 1—good recent reference books and summary statistical publications, geographical, political and economic, particularly in English and French, which are more easily obtainable in London, and 2—two good thermos flasks.

5 1 Printed from the original 642 TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL OF LABOUR AND DEFENCE The peace proposal by the Poles gives us an opportunity for more systematic use of the troops which it was intended to transfer from the Caucasian Front to the Western Front.
I propose, therefore, that the Council of Defence draft a decision as follows: 1.
The troops of the Caucasian Front to march through the entire Ukraine, the route being so calculated that each volost (of the approximately 1,900 volosts of the Ukraine) is passed through twice, first by a cavalry unit and then, after an interval, an infantry unit, to fulfil (and then check fulfilment of) the following tasks: (a) the collection of food (according to the quotas to be requisitioned); (b) the formation locally, i.
e.
, in every village, of a double (compared to the quota) stock of food (collected in barns, in houses of priests, landowners, the rich, etc.
), this stock to be guarded by the local peasants on their responsibility.
This double stock is to serve as an exchange fund; from this stock held by the peasants, grain will be taken after the local peasants have been suppliedwith goods, Russian and foreign, by agreement with the local peasants; (c) the compilation (and checking) of a list of “respons-ible” peasants (5-20%, etc.
, of the householders of each village, depending on its size, to be selected from the local rich peasants starting from the top, i.
e.
, according to wealth).
The “responsible” peasants are to be personally answerable for the fulfilment of food and other assign-ments of the authorities.
After the departure of the troops, the special task of the local authorities will be to ensure the proper and safe keeping of this list (for non-fulfilment of this task—death sentence); (d) the disarming of the rich peasants.
Complete collection of arms.
Responsibility for undiscovered arms rests on the commander of the army unit; for non-declaration of arms it rests on the person with whom they are found (death sentence), and on the whole group of “responsible” peasants (a fine, not in money, but in grain and articles; con-fiscation of property, arrest; work in the mines); (e) assistance in sowing the fields, in repairs to agricul-tural implements, and other necessary work (guard-ing stores or checking the guard over them, work on the railways, etc.
) (guarding stores of salt, etc.
).
2.
For the purposes indicated above, a commissar or instructor to be added to each army unit (to its Communist cell) (muster 1,000 people if necessary from the Petrograd, Moscow, Ivanovo-Voznesensk workers) to control fulfilment of the tasks mentioned.
3.
In “stubborn” volosts or villages, the army units either to organise a “third visit” (by troops) or to remain longer billeted (up to 2 weeks) for punishment and correc-tion.
4.
Part of these decisions to he put through the Defence Council, part through the Council of the Labour Army and the Council of People’s Commissars of the Ukraine.
5.
A highly popular leaflet to be published for the peas-ants to explain matters in general, and the idea of the stocks of food for exchange for foreign goods, in particular.
A commission to be set up at once for publishing such a leaflet, and a series of them, as well as a number of in-structions.
For drafting these proposals, a commission to be set up at once consisting of Comrades Bryukhanov and Sklyan-sky.
Comrade Stalin to be asked to be the chairman of the commission.

Isn’t that so? In reply to Kamenev’s request I am sending you for cod-ing:To Kamenev in code In my opinion, the whole point is that France and Das-zynski are torpedoing the actual meeting in Minsk.

To talk of expediting the armistice when the enemy is attacking, is idiocy.
Once the Poles have gone over to an offensive along the entire line, one should not whimper (like Danishevsky) for that is ridiculous.
A counter-move should be devised: military measures (en-veloping, dragging out all negotiations, etc.

Do your utmost to bring this home to the British workers; write articles and theses for them yourself, teach Marxism concretely, teach them to make use of the leftward swings of the Hendersons, teach them agi-tation among the masses—that is your main task.

Ilyin’s) 5, Pryazhka Thank you very much for sending another copy of the atlas Railways of Russia, and please do not forget that if a new atlas is to be published giving the new administra-tive divisions, it is essential very carefully to collect infor-mation from the People’s Commissariats about the boun-daries both of the new gubernias and also of the Tatar, Bashkir and other republics, regions and communes (Ger-man, Chuvash), and others.
It is unlikely that this can be done without a commission under the Council of People’s Commissars.

DZERZHINSKY Comrade Dzerzhinsky, I enclose a coded message from Comrade Beloborodov.
444 In my opinion the danger is immense.
I propose: the adoption of a directive from the Political Bureau asking the Orgbureau, by arrangement with the Com-missariat for Military Affairs and the Vecheka, to draw up emergency measures to combat the danger of a re-volt and to mobilise sufficient army, Cheka and Party forces.
Please hand all this at once to Comrade Krestinsky (he will be away for only a few hours today) and for your part adopt all measures at once.
If we are faced with a revolt on the Kuban, our whole policy (which was spoken about in the C.
C.
) will crash.
It is necessary, at all costs, to prevent a revolt, and not to grudge people or efforts for this.

LEZHAVA Rykov Supreme Economic Council Lezhava People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade The various big timber export deals concluded by our London Trade Delegation are of great political and econom-ic importance.
They virtually break the blockade.
The most serious attention, therefore, should be given to the precise and careful execution of these contracts, in accord-ance with the terms agreed on.
Please give immediately all the relevant instructions along these lines and establish effective control over their implementation.
At the same time there is obvious need for increasing our export stock to the utmost, primarily by stepping up the procurement of timber for export.
In order to make the latter a priority job, please draft and submit to the Council of People’s Commissars as soon as possible a decree on the measures that should be adopted, indicating among them the organisation of control over the bodies in charge of the procurement of raw materials for export.

2) The limit of territorial concessions on our part can be the fron-tier along the river Shara, the Oginsky Canal, the rivers Yaselda and Styr and further along the state frontier between Russia and Eastern T Galicia.
Shifting our frontier still more to the east would create extremely difficult strategic conditions for us, depriving us of such important railway junctions as Baranovichi, Luninets, Sarny and Rovno.
Moreover, the state of our armies and the strategic position in general do not call for such a big sacrifice.

For us, the crux of the matter is: first, that we have an armistice in a short time; second, and this is the main thing, that we have a real guarantee of real peace within 10 days.
Your task is to ensure this and check on the reality of the guarantee of actual fulfilment.
If you do ensure this, give the maximum concessions up to the line along the river Shara, the Oginsky Canal, the rivers Yaselda and Styr and further along the state frontier between Russia and Eastern Galicia.
If, however, in spite of all our efforts and concessions this can in no way be ensured, then your only task is to expose the delay of the Poles and definitely prove to us the inevitability of a winter campaign.

Undoubtedly, in the early stages we, as is done nowadays in all Europe and America, have to pay particular attention to the ra-] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] tional utilisation of the already existing electro-technical equipment.

|||| Recently, throughout the provinces, we observe a widespread tend-ency towards the construction of new small stations, particularly in those cases where it is possible to use some kind of water power.
However vital this trend may be, we should not forget that from the point of view of expediency in the matter of electrification only N.
B.
big district power stations are a decisive factor.
.
.
.
.
.
.
At present three-quarters of the work is finished, and in the middle of July we shall start on a final summary for present-ing a report on the matter to the Council of People’s Commissars.
Only when this work is completely finished, will I be able to give you a more concrete account of what we mean when we speak of the electrification of agriculture, industry and transport in Russia, hav-ing in view a definite sequence of works embracing, approximately, the period of the next ten years.
G.
Krzhizhanovsky This is where the question arises: up to now, in all five numbers of the Bulletin, we have had only long-term “schemes” and “plans”, but nothing immediate.
What exactly (precisely) is lacking for “accelerating the setting in motion of the existing power stations”? This is the crux.
Yet there is not a word about this.
What is lacking? Workers? Skilled workers? Machinery? Metal? Fuel? Anything else? A “plan” to obtain everything that is lacking must be drawn up and published at once.

1920 Comrade Trotsky, I enclose herewith information from Comrade Sklyan-sky.
465 It appears that the offensive against the Crimea has been put off until 27/X!!! Is there a decision of the Revolutionary Military Coun-cil of the Republic on this??? The Commander -in-Chief boasted to me that by October 10 (or 8) he would have everything ready for the offensive.
Does this mean he lied? When was it decided to send Budyonny there? Why, even without him forces three times as large were promised.
Finally, if the old plan is to be changed at all, is it not enough to give 1 division? It turns out that all the calculations of the Commander-in-Chief are not worth a damn and are changed weekly like those of an ignoramus! Extremely dangerous vacillations!

Comrade Bryukhanov, 1) The description relates to the period of the landing.
After it was liquidated the feeling and the state of affairs changed completely as, incidentally, Lander told me yes-terday.
2) Lander also tells me that precisely now, after the successful suppression of a number of revolts (connected with the landing), grain collection (chiefly in the Kuban area, where there is plenty of grain) has gone forward and will go forward.
3) In Lander’s opinion, we can take there more than the estimated requisition quota.
Draw Frumkin’s attention to this in a confidential letter (not a telegram) to him.
We must make the most of this opportunity, not lose time (it will be worse later), and ap-ply our efforts to the Kuban.

1920 Comrade Krestinsky, Please raise the question in the Orgbureau.
I think more should be issued for the sick by way of special diet and a decision adopted to improve it, by setting up a medical commission.
For scorbutics and other patients, I think, we should at once allow purchases to be made on the free market, subject to certain rules (perhaps also a commission and with the co-operation of the state farms).
Regarding the protest of the Petrograd Central Committee, I propose that votes be collected.
I vote for: 1) mobilising Zinoviev; 2) cancelling general mobilisation of men.

Consequently, there was not even an “approach” to me here on the part of Comrade Bonch-Bruyevich.

Joffe says: the Poles are afraid of a break even more than we are), the Politbureau of the Central Committee instructs the mil-itary authorities to incur a certain amount of risk and take some units from the South-Western Front for the speediest and surest liquidation of Wrangel.

There is terrible discontent.
The Gubernia Food Commis-sar says: nothing will be given until the whole requisition quota is fulfilled.
They insist on the need for goods to be issued immedi-ately.
They say that the quota of 27 million poods is excessive, seed corn is being taken, and there is bound to be under-sowing.

and for the country’s electrification, mechanisation of peatextraction makes it possible to go ahead immeasurably more rapidly and firmly and on a broader front.

Please discuss this question immediately and give me without delay your comments (corrections, additions, coun-ter-plans, and so on) on the following proposals arising from yesterday’s preliminary exchange of opinions.
1 .
To regard work on applying the hydraulic method of peat extraction as of prime state importance and therefore especially urgent-To pass a decision to this effect through the Council of People’s Commissars on Saturday, 30/X.
2.
To instruct all chief committees (and other bodies), on whose support the successful work of the Commission (or committee?) for Hydraulic Peat Extraction (under the Chief Peat Committee) mainly depends, to delegate their represen-tatives (preferably Communists or, in any case, people known to be conscientious and particularly energetic) to take a permanent part in this commission.
To make them respon-sible, in particular, for the speediest fulfilment, without any procrastination, of the orders and requests of this commis-sion.
To give the Council of People’s Commissars the names and addresses of these representatives.
3.
The same in regard to some of the most important fac-tories involved.
List of these factories to be drawn up.
4.
To instruct the Naval Department to have its own representative on the commission, one fully acquainted with the stocks of materials and technical facilities of this depart-ment.
5.
To issue Red Army rations to the group of people on whose work the rapid and complete success of the matter directly depends, increasing at the same time their remune-ration so as to enable them to devote themselves wholly and completely to their work.
To instruct the Commis-sion for Hydraulic Peat Extraction to send immediately to the People’s Commissariat for Food and the All-Russia Central Council of Trade Unions a list (exact) of these peo-ple, indicating standards of remuneration, bonuses, etc.
6.
To discuss immediately with the People’s Commis-sariat for Foreign Trade what orders should be placed at once with Swedish and German factories (perhaps engagingthere one or several prominent chemists) so that by the sum-mer of 1921 we can receive what is necessary for the speed-iest and widest application of the hydraulic method.
In particular, to make use of Comrade Lomonosov who is due to leave for Sweden and Germany within the next few days.
7.
To instruct the Cinema Department (of the People’s Commissariat for Education?) to arrange for the film of the hydraulic method to be shown on a wide scale (partic-ularly in Petrograd, Ivanovo-Voznesensk, Moscow and peat-extraction localities) with the simultaneous reading, without fail, of a brief and popular leaflet (ask Comrade Sosnovsky to edit it) explaining the gigantic importance of mechanising peat extraction and of electrification.

Comrade Rykov, should not the question be raised of using more of the materials and technical facilities of the Naval Department for the needs of the production of the means of production? Why should we want new battle-ships and the like? Aren’t they out of place just now? Sha-tunovsky (take notice of him, he is a devoted and valuable man; a worker, studied mathematics abroad) says (according to Sosnovsky) that in the Naval Department Trotsky discov-ered something like a million poods of first-grade steel (for battleships) and took it for the Chief Transport Commission.
Check this, think it over, perhaps we shall put it before the Council of Defence or the Council of People’s Commis-sars.

NOTES1Lenin’s instruction was written on an order to the Red Guard Staff issued by the Military Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet.
The order gave instructions for petrol, four artillery batteries, three motorcars, field telephones and cyclists or motorcyclists to be dispatched to the Pulkovo headquarters at positions near Tsarskoye Selo.
The order called for the dispatch of petrol, a motorcar, two artillery batteries, sappers for trench-digging, motorcycle or bicycle messengers and maps of the locality, to the Staff of the Izmailovo Regiment on the main road to Moscow.
The Military Revolutionary Committee proposed also that “a joint staff for the operation as a whole” should be set up and food supplies organised for the Red Guard.

of the Bolshevik Party at a sitting held on November 2 (15), 1917, strongly condemned the Right-opportunist, conciliatory attitude of the capitulators (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
277-79).
Apparently, this note of Lenin’s was written during the sitting of the Central Committee.
The note was read out at a sitting of the Petrograd Committee of the Party.
In a resolution on the current situation, the Petro-grad Committee stated that the government in the proletarian republic had to be a government of the Soviets of Workers’, Sol-diers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, that the task of Soviet power was to put into effect the revolutionary programme advanced by the Bolsheviks, and that any departure from it was impermissible.
This resolution was sent to the Party Central Committee.
On November 3 (16), the Central Committee presented an ultimatum to the opposition minority demanding complete subor-dination to the decisions of the Central Committee (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
280-82).
The conciliators, however, refused to submit to Party discipline, and resigned from the Central Com-mittee and the Council of People’s Commissars.
The Central Committee branded them as saboteurs (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
302-03).
New people, loyal to the cause of the Party, were brought into the government.

4Lenin wrote this letter because the representative of the Interna-tional Association for Information of the Labour Press of America, France and Great Britain, the Rumanian journalist Nicolae Cocea, at that time in Petrograd, had requested him on behalf of the Association to reply to the following six questions: “1) Will the Government of People’s Commissars continue with the same vigour its former home policy and its international efforts on behalf of peace? 2) What great reforms are being planned by the present government for establishing a socialist system in Russia? 3) After the Constituent Assembly is convened will the Government of People’s Commissars be responsible to it as in constitutional states, or not? 4) Do you think that the peace Russia proposes will put an end to militarism throughout the world? 5) When and how do you intend to begin demobilising the Russians? 6) Do you think that with the present state of Europe the complete realisa-tion of socialism is possible?” In a letter in reply to Lenin, Nicolae Cocea assured him that his conditions in regard to the publication of his replies would be fully observed.
Lenin wrote on Cocea’s letter: “Reply given 10/XI.

At this Congress the elec-tion of the Party’s central bodies resulted in Lenin’s support-ers winning a majority (the Russian word for majority is bolshin-stvo) and they were therefore called Bolsheviks, while the opportu-nists were left in the minority (in Russian menshinstvo) and were given the name Mensheviks.
The Mensheviks came out against the Party’s revolutionary programme.
They were opposed to the hegemony of the proletariat in the revolution, and the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, and were in favour of an agreement with the liberal bourgeoisie.
After the defeat of the 1905-07 revolution the Mensheviks wanted to liquidate the illegal proletarian revolutionary party.

recognised the Ukrainian Soviet Government as the sole legiti-mate government of the Ukraine.
In January 1918, Soviet troops in the Ukraine launched an offensive and on January 26 (Febru-ary 8) seized Kiev and deposed the bourgeois Rada.
The Central Rada, routed and driven from the territory of the Soviet Ukraine, and having no support among the working masses, allied itself with the German imperialists in order to overthrow Soviet power and restore the bourgeois regime in the Ukraine.
During the peace negotiations between the Soviet Re-public and Germany, the Rada sent its delegation to Brest-Li-tovsk and behind the back of the Soviet delegation concluded a separate peace with Germany, by which it undertook to supply Germany with Ukrainian grain, coal and raw materials in return for military assistance in the struggle against Soviet power.
In March 1918 the Rada returned to Kiev with the Austrian and German invaders and became their puppet.
At the end of April the interventionists dismissed the Rada, realising that it was incapable of suppressing the revolutionary movement in the Uk-raine and ensuring delivery of the required food supplies.

After the counter-revolutionary majority of the Constituent Assembly had refused to recognise the Soviet Government and its decrees, and had rejected the Declaration of Rights of the Working and Exploited People proposed by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, the Bolshevik group led by Lenin walked out.
Late the same night the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries also walked out.
There remained in the hall only the Constitutional-Democrats, Right Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks.
By the decree of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee of January 6 (19) the bourgeois Constituent Assembly was dis-solved.

On Lenin’s instructions, an investigating commission was immediately appointed.
Those guilty of the murder were arrest-ed and tried.
p.

Under the influence of coun-ter-revolutionary agitation, these sailors defied the laws of the Soviet Government, went on drinking bouts, and carried out illegal searches and arrests.

On January 27 (new style), 1918, the bourgeois government of Svinhufvud was overthrown and power passed into the hands of the workers.
On January 29, a Finnish revolutionary govern-ment was set up—the Council of People’s Representatives— which included E.
Gylling, O.
Kuusinen, Y.
Sirola, A.
Taimi and others.
But the proletarian revolution was victorious only in southern Finland.
The Svinhufvud government, entrenched in the north, appealed to the government of imperial Germany for assistance.
Owing to the intervention of the German armed forces, the workers’ revolution in Finland was crushed on May 2, 1918, after a bitter civil war which lasted for three months.
A per-iod of white terror set in in Finland and thousands of revolu-tionary workers and peasants were executed or tortured to death in the prisons.

60 25On January 28 (February 10), 1918, at the Brest-Litovsk peace conference—contrary to Lenin’s directive that a peace treaty should be signed if the Germans presented an ultimatum demand-ing it—Trotsky declared that the Soviet Government refused to sign a peace treaty on the terms put forward by Germany, but that it considered the war at an end and was demobilising the army.

The telegram did not mention that the peace negotiations in Brest had been broken off, the inference from its text being that the conference had culminated in the conclusion of peace.
In the early morning on January 29 (February 11), Su-preme Commander-in-Chief N.
V.
Krylenko, on the basis of Trot-sky’s telegram, issued an order which announced that peace had been concluded and called for the cessation of military operations on all fronts and demobilisation of the army.
It was in conse-quence of Krylenko’s order that Lenin sent this telegram and the one following it.

60 26The First Russian Society of Communist Agricultural Workers was organised early in 1918 on the initiative of workers at the Obukhov Factory in Petrograd.
Lenin greatly assisted in its organ-isation.
In March 1918, members of the society with their fami-lies went to Kazakhstan, where they settled and were given land to cultivate.
Civil war prevented the development of the Petro-grad workers’ initiative.
The communards failed to reap even their first harvest.
Kulaks and White Cossacks attacked the com-mune and broke it up.

The telegram stated: “A Swedish steamer, a cruiser and a des-troyer flying the Swedish naval flag, arrived off the Öland Island, landed 15 Swedish marines, and by threatening to use their arms forced our communications personnel to retreat.

67 32The Party Central Committee, at its meeting on February 22, 1918, discussed the question of procuring from Britain and France arms and food necessary for the defence of the Soviet Republic against the advancing German troops.
This was opposed by the “Left Communists”, who regarded any agreement with the imperialists as impermissible in principle.
Lenin could not attend the meeting and therefore sent his opinion to the Central Committee.
The Party Central Committee adopted a resolution recognis-ing the need to use every means to arm and equip the Red Army, including that of obtaining armaments and equipment from gov-ernments of capitalist countries, while at the same time pur-suing a fully independent foreign policy.
On the same day a sit-ting of the Council of People’s Commissars also passed a decision in favour of obtaining arms and food supplies from Britain and p.

33On February 25, the Soviet delegation, which had left for Brest-Litovsk to sign the peace treaty, was delayed at Novoselye rail-way station, where a bridge had been blown up.
Unable to get in touch directly with the German Government, the delegation wired the Council of People’s Commissars requesting that the German Government be informed of the arrival of the delegation.
Lenin’s remark about possible waverings on the part of the dele-gation was apparently due to the fact that two of its members, G.

68 34The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries—the Left wing of the petty-bourgeois Socialist-Revolutionary Party, which was organised as an independent party in November 1917.
In an effort to maintain their influence among the peasants, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries entered into an agreement with the Bolsheviks.
They pledged themselves to carry out the general policy of the Soviet Government and were given posts in the Coun-cil of People’s Commissars and on the boards of several People’s Commissariats.
But differences with the Bolsheviks on basic issues of the theory and practice of socialist construction soon made themselves felt.
In January and February 1918, the Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party began a campaign against the conclusion of the Brest Peace Treaty with Germany.
When the treaty had been signed and ratified by the Fourth Congress of Soviets in March 1918, the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries with-drew from the Council of People’s Commissars.
In July 1918 the Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries organised the provocative assassination of Mirbach, the German Ambassador in Moscow, and launched an armed revolt against Soviet power.
Having lost all support among the masses, the Left Socialist-Re-volutionary Party finally took the path of armed struggle against Soviet rule.

At the end of April 1918, the Congress of Soviets of the North-ern Region established, for military and economic purposes, a Union of Communes of the Northern Region, which included also Petrograd Gubernia.

Centrosibir—the Central Executive Committee of Siberian Soviets; was elected by the First Congress of Siberian Soviets, held in Irkutsk from October 16 (29) to October 24 (November 6), 1917.
After the temporary downfall of Soviet power in Siberia (in the summer of 1918) Centrosibir ceased its activity.

The Soviet Government’s communique on the landing of Japa-nese troops in Vladivostok, written on April 5 and published in Pravda and Izvestia on April 6, 1918, pointed out that resistance to the Japanese invasion and a relentless struggle against their agents and accomplices within the country was a matter of life and death for the Soviet Republic, for the working people of the whole of Russia.
On April 7, 1918, Lenin sent a telegram with directives to the Vladivostok Soviet, warning that the interven-tionists were sure to advance and demanding that the Com-munists of the Far East without delay should start preparing to fight the foreign intervention (see present edition, Vol.

This report on the economic situation in Rybinsk was made at a sitting of the Board of the Supreme Economic Council on April 15, 1918; on a proposal by Lenin, it was decided to grant an immediate loan to Rybinsk.

The draft, after being revised in the People’s Commissariat for Finance, was re-edited by Lenin, given a head-ing and, on April 17, 1918, submitted for consideration to the Council of People’s Commissars.
The following decision on the draft was adopted: “To be referred to the People’s Commissariats for Foreign Affairs and Justice for their consideration with the assistance of experts, and the conclusion to be presented to the next sitting of the Council of People’s Commissars on April 18.

79 44Lenin’s letter was due to the following circumstance.
On Janu-ary 4 (17), 1918, the Council of People’s Commissars adopted a decree on the reorganisation of the Red Cross on the basis of the abolished Chief Board of the Red Cross that had existed under the tsarist government, making over its property and funds to the state.
The work of reorganising the Red Cross was entrusted (§ 3 of Section 1 of the decree) to a committee of representatives of Soviet, military and public organisations.
The committee was instructed to submit to the Council of People’s Commissars through the Council of Medical Collegiums a plan for reorganising the Red Cross institutions.
However, the committee failed to fulfil the tasks entrusted to it, and this was brought to the notice of Lenin by V.

79 45This refers to preparations for a monetary reform in order to es-tablish a stable Soviet currency and overcome the inflation caused by the war and the economic policy of the tsarist government and the bourgeois Provisional Government.
Lenin raised the question of the need for a monetary reform in December 1917 in his “Draft Decree on the Nationalisation of the Banks and on Measures Necessary for Its Implementation” (see present edition, Vol.
26, p.
393).
Preparations for the monetary reform were made under the direct guidance of Lenin.
He urged more speed in preparing and issuing new, Soviet currency notes, and went into all details of the proposed designs.
(See this volume, documents 125 and 126, and also Lenin Miscellany XXI, p.
180.
) Owing to the foreign military intervention and the Civil War, and the transition to the policy of War Communism, the mone-tary reform was not carried out in that period.
The first Soviet monetary reform on the basis of Lenin’s principles was effected p.

” On the eve of his departure from Soviet Russia for the United States, R.
Robins wrote to Lenin expressing sincere thanks for the assistance given him in his work for the American Red Cross Mission.
A few days later, on May 11, 1918, Lenin wrote a letter ad-dressed “To All Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies and Other Soviet Organisations”, requesting them “to give every assistance to Colonel Robins and the other members of the Ame-rican Red Cross Mission for their unhindered and speedy journey from Moscow to Vladivostok”.

P.
Malinovsky, Acting People’s Commissar for the Properties of the Republic, in connection with the implementation of the decree of the Council of People’s Com-missars “On the Monuments of the Republic”, adopted on April 12, 1918, and published on April 14 in Pravda and Izvestia.
The decree set the task of removing monuments to the tsars and their servants that were of no historical or artistic value, and of erect-ing revolutionary monuments.
A special commission, consisting of the People’s Commissar for Education, the People’s Commissar for the Properties of the Republic and the head of the Fine Arts Department of the People’s Commissariat for Education, was instructed to determine which monuments in Moscow and Petro-grad were to be removed, and advised to enlist the services of artists in designing new, revolutionary monuments.
The Council of People’s Commissars proposed that by May 1 the commission should have removed the ugliest monuments and submitted the first models of new monuments, and should also hasten arrange-ments for replacing old inscriptions, emblems and street names by new ones reflecting the ideas and sentiments of revolutionary Russia.
Lenin attached great importance to the implementation of this decree, the progress of which was discussed at the sittings of the Council of People’s Commissars on July 8, 17 and 30, 1918.
Lenin repeatedly criticised the heads of the People’s Commissar-iats for Education and for the Properties of the Republic, and the heads of the Moscow Soviet, for the unsatisfactory implemen-tation of the decree (see this volume, Document 109, and present edition, Vol.

for the defence of the joint interests of the Socialist Republics.
After the defeat of the revo-lution in Finland, the Finnish bourgeois government with the support of the German imperialists demanded that Fort Ino be handed over to Finland.
Before it was abandoned, the main worksof the fort were blown up by order of the Commandant of the Kronstadt fortress.
In May 1918, Finnish troops occupied Fort Ino.
p.
84 53An emergency meeting of the Party Central Committee on May 6, 1918, discussed the international situation of the Soviet Republic in connection with the aggravation of relations with Germany, who demanded that Fort Ino be handed over to bourgeois Finland, and also in connection with the British occupation of Murmansk and the preparations by the interventionist troops to advance into the interior of the country.
The Central Committee adopted the decision on the international situation proposed by Lenin p.
84 (see present edition, Vol.
27, pp.
355 and 379-80).
54This note is a reply to A.
D.
Tsyurupa, who had informed Lenin that the food organisation of the Nikolayevskaya Railway had refused to allow A.
I.
Svidersky, member of the Board of the People’s Commissariat for Food, to carry out an inspection agreed upon between the Food Commissariat, the Commissariat for Railways, and the Supreme Economic Council.
Tsyurupa asked Lenin’s advice as to what steps should be taken in this case.
p.
85 55Lenin wrote this letter after a talk with the Chairman of the Pur-chasing Commission of the Putilov (now Kirov) Works, a plater in the boiler-shop, A.
V.
Ivanov, who gave a detailed descrip-tion of the grave state of famine in Petrograd and told of the situation at the works and the mood of the workers.
Lenin informed Ivanov of the decree passed at the meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars on May 9, 1918, giving the People’s Commissar for Food emergency powers in the strug-gle against the rural bourgeoisie, who were concealing grain and profiteering.
Lenin gave Ivanov a copy of the decree so that he could make it known to the Putilov workers.
The meeting between A.

Ivanov and Lenin is described in the book Vospominaniya o Vladimire Ilyiche Lenine (Reminis-cences of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin), Part 2, 1957, pp.

86 56This refers to a meeting of the Russo-German Commission held in Moscow on May 15, 1918, to discuss the conditions for resuming economic relations between Russia and Germany.
The report at the meeting was made by M.
G.
Bronsky, Deputy People’s Com-missar for Trade and Industry.
The main propositions in his report had been vetted by Lenin.
p.
86 57In a plan for the development of trade and economic relations with the U.
S.
A.
drafted on Lenin’s initiative, the Soviet Govern-ment expressed its readiness to pay for goods purchased in the U.

with agricultural produce and products of the mining industry, and also to offer concessions to the U.
S.
A.
on the same terms as to other countries.
The plan, under the heading “Russo-American Trade Rela-tions”, was first published in June 1918 in No.

87 58This note to G.
V.
Chicherin was written following the receipt of a report that troops of the Transcaucasian bourgeois govern-ment, supported by a flotilla of armed merchant vessels, were advancing on Sukhum, creating a threat to the entire Black Sea coast.
In the draft of a telegram submitted to Lenin, which was addressed to Sablin, Chief of the Naval Forces of the Black Sea Fleet, the latter was instructed to arm a number of Soviet merchant ships and send them for the defence of Sukhum.
On May 20, 1918, the Soviet Government sent a Note to the German Government protesting against the German military authorities conniving at the actions of the armed merchant ships of “the so-called Transcaucasian government, which is recogni-sed by absolutely nobody in Transcaucasia”.
p.
88 59This refers to a draft decree for reorganising the Food Commis-sariat and the local food bodies.
At a meeting of the C.
P.
C.
on May 20, 1918, A.
D.
Tsyurupa, on Lenin’s instructions, moved that the draft decree be submitted for discussion.
The draft was discussed at meetings of the C.
P.
C.
on May 22 and 23, and was adopted with amendments.
It was decided to refer the decree to the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, where it was endorsed on May 27.
It was published in Izvestia No.
109 on May 31, 1918.
Clause 3 of the decree envisaged the establishment under the local food commissariats of special detachments of workers recom-mended by Party and trade union organisations, formed mainly in the consuming districts.
These detachments were to be at the disposal of the local food bodies and comply with their directives, and were to be employed in propaganda, organising and instruct-ors’ work.
“The most important task of the workers’ detach-ments,” states the decree, “should be to organise the working peasantry against the kulaks” (Dekrety Sovetskoi vlasti [Decrees of the Soviet Government], Vol.
11, 1959, p.
310).
p.
89 60In the spring of 1918 the German interventionists occupied the Ukraine, invaded the Crimea and approached Sevastopol, where the Black Sea Fleet was concentrated.
On April 29-30, to save the fleet from the invaders, the Soviet Government transferred it to Novorossiisk.
Ten days after the fleet’s arrival there, the Ger-man Command sent an ultimatum demanding its return to Seva-stopol, threatening otherwise to continue the offensive along the Black Sea coast.
On May 11, the Soviet Government sent a “ Pro-test to the German Government against the Occupation of the Crimea”, stating the circumstances of the fleet’s transfer and the possible conditions for its return to Sevastopol (see present edi-tion, Vol.
27, pp.
358-59).
All attempts to reach an agreement with the German Govern-ment on this question were abortive.
Having no possibility of saving the fleet and to avoid surrendering it to the German imperialists, Lenin issued an order to the Supreme Military Coun-cil for its immediate destruction (see the next document).
A secret instruction of the Council of People’s Commissars ordered the destruction of all the ships of the Black Sea Fleet and merchant steamships in Novorossiisk.
On June 18-19, 1918, the order of the government was carried out: most of the ships were sunk off the Novorossiisk coast.

D.
Tsyurupa were written in connection with the need to explain to the mass of the working people the deci-sion on independent procurements adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars on June 1, 1918.
The decision pointed out that independent grain procurements, for which the Council of People’s Commissars was being asked by representatives of some organisations and trade unions, could disrupt the whole business of food supply, clear the way for the kulaks and landowners, and ruin the revolution.
The decision set the task of organising food detachments, selecting for them the best and most devoted people from among the workers and office personnel “in order to form a general working-class fighting force for establishing order, for assisting with supervision, for collecting all grain surpluses, for complete victory over speculators” (Dekrety Sovetskoi vlasti, Vol.
II, pp.
379-81).

100 70After the capture of Omsk by Czech and Russian whiteguards on June 7, 1918, a Siberian whiteguard puppet government was set up there with the assistance of the interventionists.
It consist-ed in the main of Socialist-Revolutionaries, with Mensheviks and Constitutional-Democrats participating.
Behind a screen of democratic phrases it pursued a counter-revolutionary policy, paving the way for the transition to an open military dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and landowners.
G.
Y.
Zinoviev’s inquiry concerned the purchase of grain in Omsk for Petrograd.
p.
103 71This refers to the decree “On the Monuments of the Republic”, adopted at a sitting of the Council of People’s Commissars on April 12, 1918 (see this volume, Document 75 and Note 47).
p.
105 72This refers to the capture of Syzran by units of the Czecho-slovak Army Corps.
This Corps was formed in Russia before the October Revolu-tion from among Czechs and Slovaks who were taken prisoner as soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian army.
By the agreement of March 26, 1918, the Soviet Government gave the Corps the oppor-tunity of leaving Russia via Vladivostok on condition that it surrender its weapons and remove its Russian commanders.
But on the orders and with the support of the imperialists of the U.
S.
A.
, Britain and France, the counter-revolutionary com-manders of the Corps engineered an armed revolt by the Corps against the Soviet government at the end of May.
Acting in close contact with the whiteguards and kulaks, the White Czechoslovak Corps occupied a considerable part of the Urals, the Volga area and Siberia.
In the districts occupied by the Czechoslovak mutineers, whiteguard governments were formed with the participation of the Mensheviks and Socialist-Revolutionaries.
Many soldiers in the Corps, seeing how they had been betrayed by their counter-revolutionary command, refused to fight againstSoviet Russia and deserted from the Corps.
About 12,000 Czechs and Slovaks fought in the ranks of the Red Army.
The Volga area was liberated by the Red Army in the au-tumn of 1918.
The White Czechoslovak Corps was completely routed simultaneously with the wiping out of Kolchak’s forces.

106 73Lenin is referring to the following writings: the pamphlet by Rosa Luxemburg—Junius, Die Krise der Sozialdemokratie; the pamphlet circulated in Germany in manuscript form: Klassen-kampf gegen den Kriegl Material zum “Fall” Liebknecht (Class Struggle Against the War.
Material to Liebknecht’s “Case”); cuttings from the newspaper Berner Tagwacht, organ of the Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland.

A.
Mekhonoshin, a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Eastern Front, asked by direct line for informa-tion concerning the situation resulting from the revolt of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in Moscow on July 6, 1918.
He asked to be informed what stand the Left Socialist-Revolutionary A.
L.
Kolegayev had taken.
Mekhonoshin also reported that M.
A.
Muravyov, a Left Socialist-Revolutionary in command of the troops of the Eastern Front, had proclaimed his loyalty to Soviet power and stated that he renounced his membership of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party because that party opposed Soviet power.
However, Muravyov made this statement in order to conceal his own treacherous activity.
On receiving a telegram from the Central Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party alleging that the Left S.
R.
s had succeeded in seizing power in Moscow, he went over to the insurgents.
According to their plan, Muravyov was to make the troops on the Eastern Front take up arms against Soviet power and, after joining forces with the white Czechs, to march on Moscow.
On July 10, on arriving at Simbirsk,Muravyov announced that he did not recognise the Brest peace and declared war on Germany.
The Soviet Government took urgent measures to liquidate Muravyov’s adventure.
A government statement of July 11 de-clared him a traitor and enemy of Soviet power.
On the evening of July 11, Muravyov was invited to a sitting of the Simbirsk Executive Committee.
When Muravyov’s traitorous telegrams on the cessation of military operations against the interventionists and whiteguards were read out at the sitting, the Communists demanded his arrest.
Muravyov offered resistance and was killed.
and his accomplices were arrested.

p.
115 80This evidently refers to the fact that at a meeting convened by the Saratov Committee of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary Party in connection with the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries’ revolt in Moscow, a decision was adopted condemning the actions of the C.
C.
of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries tending to undermine Soviet power.
The Saratov combat squad of Left Socialist-Revolutiona-ries at their meeting denounced the treachery of the Left Social-ist-Revolutionaries in Moscow and declared that they stood by the platform of defence of Soviet power.
On receipt of a report from Saratov on the decisions adopted by the meeting of the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, Lenin sent it to Pravda with the following introductory words: “Commissar Ivanov, travelling to the Caucasus, reports from Saratov.
” It was published in Pravda with this introduction.
p.
117 81This was written in connection with a letter sent to the Naval Board by the Bureau of Supply of the North Caucasian Military District, requesting urgently to dispatch to the Caspian Sea and river Kura 8-10 motor vessels, which were to be put at the dispos-al of the Baku Council of People’s Commissars.
The letter speci-fied the types of vessels, which were to be equipped with ordnance and machine-guns, and also with spare parts for the engines.
p.
117 82In reply to Lenin’s inquiry, Podvoisky, a member of the Sup-reme Military Council, reported that the units which were to be sent from Kursk to the Eastern Front were still being raised and that a brigade of three regiments with three batteries would be entrained on July 23.
p.
118 83Podvoisky had proposed taking upon himself the leadership in suppressing the Czechoslovak revolt and counter-revolutionary actions in the Volga area and the Urals.
p.
119 84Later, in reply to an inquiry from Lydia Fotieva about this letter of Lenin’s, Larin informed her: “The letter from Vladimir Ilyich which you sent (concerning the drafting of a pamphlet about the Supreme Economic Council) was never received by me.
Perhapsit relates to the time when (in 1918) I was sent to Berlin to con-duct negotiations with the Germans, and was to be handed to me on my return.
At any rate, soon after returning I received a letter from Vladimir Ilyich on a similar subject, only broader in con-tent—to write about the Soviet Republic in general, not merely about the Supreme Economic Council (the letter has not been found.
—Ed.
), so as to acquaint people abroad and our own popu-lation with what had been achieved in one year.
To this end, Vla-dimir Ilyich later wrote an order to all government departments to give me all the information I needed (see Lenin Miscellany XXI, p.
139.
—Ed.
).
But the material sent in by the departments was far from satisfactory and we had to abandon the thought of compiling such a factual report of the government for the first year of our rule, the idea of which had apparently dismissed from Vladimir Ilyich’s mind the proposal for a pamphlet about the Supreme Economic Council alone.
” Connected with Lenin’s instructions mentioned by Larin in his letter to Fotieva is the decision drafted by Lenin and adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars on August 29, 1918, call-ing for written reports to be submitted by the People’s Commis-sariats on their work since October 25 (November 7), 1917, and Lenin’s letter to the People’s Commissars on this question (see present edition, Vol.

28, pp.
45-47): “On Drawing Workers’ Organisations into Grain Procurement” (in Lenin’s letter it is called a decree on collective trains) and “On Harvesting and Harvesting-Requisitioning Detach-ments”.
The decrees were adopted at the sittings of the Council of People’s Commissars on August 3 and 4, 1918, and published in Izvestia on August 6.
Clause 7 of the decree “On Drawing Workers’ Organisations into Grain Procurement”, mentioned lower down in the document, states: “Detachments setting out to procure grain are obliged to assist the local population in bringing in the harvest.
” p.
125 87After the capture of Archangel by the Entente troops on August 2, 1918, a group of functionaries of the Archangel Gubernia Execu-tive Committee went to Vologda to report to M.
S.
Kedrov on the situation on the Northern Dvina.
In Vologda, they learned of L.
D.
Trotsky’s order, which demanded that the functionaries who had left Archangel should be regarded as deserters and tried by the Supreme Revolutionary Tribunal.
The group of Communists, outraged by this order, since they were not directly to blame for the fall of Archangel, sent a request to Lenin and Sverdlov to be allowed to come to Moscow and report the truth about the events.
In reply, Lenin sent the telegram published here.

Pe-truchuk, representative of the Moscow Regional Commissariat for Military Affairs, who had been sent to Orsha to expedite the dispatch of Red Army units to the Eastern Front.
Petruchuk re-ported demoralisation in a number of army units and poor work on the part of local Soviet bodies, and he asked to be allowed to use the direct line.

I.
Potyaev, People’s Commissar for Finance of the Northern Region, to the Chief of the Stationery Office in Penza that the unloading of the Stationery Office’s train should be held up, contrary to Lenin’s order dated August 16, 1918.
The Left Socialist-Revolutionaries’ revolt in Chembar, an uyezd town in Penza Gubernia, mentioned in the telegram, broke out on the night of August 18.
On August 20, the revolt was put down by a detachment of Lettish riflemen and Red Army men, who had arrived from Penza.

135 94Lenin lived at the house of Latukka in Vyborg from September 17 (30) to October 7 (20), 1917, after the July events, when he went into hiding to avoid persecution by the bourgeois Provision-al Government.
p.
136 95The Poor Peasants’ Committees were instituted by a decree of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on June 11, 1918.
They played a tremendous part in the struggle against the kulaks and in consolidating Soviet power in the countryside.
They car-ried out strict accounting and distribution of grain and agricultur-al implements.
Already by the autumn of 1918 the Poor Peas-ants’ Committees, which played a historic role in the social-ist revolution, had successfully solved the tasks entrusted to them.
In this connection, and also in connection with the need “to com-plete Soviet construction by the creation of a uniform organisa-tion of Soviets throughout the territory of the Soviet Republic”, the Extraordinary Sixth All-Russia Congress of Soviets, held in November 1918, proposed the re-election of all volost and vil-lage Soviets, putting direct responsibility for the conduct of the elections on the Poor Peasants’ Committees.
In accordance with the election instructions published by the All-Russia Central Execu-tive Committee on December 4, 1918, the Poor Peasants’ Commit-tees were to wind up their activities after the election campaign and hand over all their funds and functions to the newly-elected Soviets.

At the meeting, in reply to a decision of members of the Gubernia Committee to send a food official and 50 Lettish Red Army men to suppress the upris-ing of the kulaks and to confiscate their grain, A.
Y.
Minkin, Chairman of the Gubernia Executive Committee, declared that he refused to carry out the decision.
p.
140 98Lenin’s letter was due to the following circumstances.
On Au-gust 24, 1918, in view of the grave food situation in the city, the Moscow Soviet passed a decision allowing the working people to bring into Moscow freely up to one-and-a-half poods of foodstuffs for their own personal consumption.
On August 26, the Council of People’s Commissars considered a draft decree on preferential conveyance of grain, the question of the decision of the Moscow Soviet being left open.
While the question was under discussion, the decision of the Moscow Soviet allowing one-and-a-half poods as baggage could not but hinder the organisation of the campaign against the black-marketeering bag-men and the regulation of the work of the inter-cepting detachments.
On August 29, L.
I.
Ruzer, member of the Board of the Food Commissariat, who was in charge of this work, asked the Board to relieve him of the work of combating bag-trading.
Ruzer wrote in his statement that he could think of “no more wordings for a single order in response to inquiries fromthe local areas”.
Tsyurupa, who was also opposed to the “one-and-a-half poods system”, added a postscript: “None of the Board members nor the Board as a whole can think of wordings that Ruzer, too, failed to find.
Conclusion: the order of the Moscow Soviet should be rescinded on approximately the following lines: the C.

is to adopt a decision at once and publish it; the decision is to indicate the date on which the order of the Moscow Soviet ceases to be effective—approximately September 15.

dated September 5, 1918, the de-cision of the Moscow Soviet and a similar decision of the Petro-grad Soviet ceased to be effective on October 1, 1918.

145 99Lenin wrote this letter when he was ill after being seriously wound-ed on August 30, 1918, by the Socialist-Revolutionary terrorist, Fanny Kaplan.
In spite of the doctors’ orders, only a few days after being wounded, Lenin began to occupy himself with affairs of state.
On September 16 the doctors allowed him to resume work.
From September 23 to mid-October Lenin was recuperating at Gorki near Moscow.
The letter mentions the harvesting of grain in Yelets Uyezd, Orel Gubernia.
On this subject see also this volume, Document 182.
The original bears the date “7.
IX.
1918”.
But in the files of the Council of People’s Commissars there is a copy of this letter on which in an unknown hand is written the date “6/IX” and the time of dispatch “21.

150104This telegram was sent in connection with the proposal of Rifaat Pasha, the Turkish Ambassador in Germany, for the signing of a protocol regulating the military situation in the Caucasus.
The draft protocol Rifaat Pasha put forward provided for the with-drawal of the Turkish troops from the Caucasus to the borders laid down by the Brest Treaty, but it lacked a clause directly trans-ferring to the Soviet authorities the territories evacuated by the Turks.
The fears expressed in this telegram were justified.
On October 30, 1918, the Turkish Government signed the Mudross armistice with the Entente countries, which contained a special clause about Turkey agreeing to the occupation of Baku by the Entente powers.
In November 1918, in accordance with this agreement, the Turks withdrew their troops from Baku and the city was occupied by the British.

The possibility of the Entente countries extending intervention against the Soviet Re-public was dealt with by Lenin in greater detail in his report at the joint session of the All-Russia Central Executive Committee, the Moscow Soviet, factory committees and trade unions on Octo-ber 22, 1918, and in the speech on the international situation at the Sixth Congress of Soviets on November 8, 1918 (ibid.

Gusev, mem-ber of the Revolutionary Military Council of the 2nd Army, he expressed the hope that Izhevsk would be liberated by the first anniversary of the October Revolution, and asked that this mes-sage should be transmitted to the Red Army men.
On November 7, troops of the division commanded by V.

The first batch of materials was received in 1924, and some of the books belonging to Lenin in 1933.
Twelve of Lenin’s books kept in the Bydgoszcz library, were handed over to the Soviet Army in 1945 as a token of gratitude for the liberation of the town from the German occu-pationists.
A large batch of materials from the Cracow-Poronin archives, discovered by archivists of the Polish People’s Repub-lic, was received in 1951.

At the top of the docu-ment received from Gorbunov, Lenin wrote an instruction to the secretary: “Phone Gorbunov and tell him to send today the exact documents concerning the half-month’s delay and copies of papers from Amosov (head of the Technical Committee of the Economic Council of the Northern Area.

Without the documents the complaint has no weight.

164 126Lenin wrote this directive to Chicherin in connection with a ra-dio-telegram from the German Government, which was set up on November 10, 1918, and consisted mainly of Right-wing Social-Democrats and Centrists.
In its radio-telegram of November 21, 1918, the German Government requested the Soviet Government to issue a statement about its recognition and the obligation “to refrain from exerting any influence on the German population for the purpose of forming a different government”.
Lenin’s instructions were reflected in the Note to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated November 25, 1918, which was signed by G.
V.
Chicherin (see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, p.
165 Vol.

127Lenin wrote this instruction on a memo from the Department of Museums and Protection of Monuments of Art and Antiquity of the People’s Commissariat for Education, sent to the Managing Department of the Council of People’s Commissars on November 26, 1918, asking that a number of premises of the Grand Palace in the Kremlin be allocated for the requirements of the state mu-seums.
On December 12, 1918, the C.
P.

166 128Lenin’s doubts about the correctness of the reports that most of the Councils of German soldiers in the Ukraine had adopted a Bol-shevik stand were fully justified.
The All-Ukraine Congress of Councils of German Soldiers, held in Kiev on December 13, 1918, was influenced by German opportunists and did not adopt any po-litical resolution.
The Congress decided to come to an agreement with Petlyura’s bands and to surrender Kiev to them without a fight in exchange for the free passage of westward-bound German troop trains.
p.
167 129This refers to the decree “On the Organisation of Supplies” adopt-ed by the Council of People’s Commissars on November 21.

168 131Lenin wrote this telegram following a complaint received from I.
V.
Bogdanov, a member of the staff of the Unemployment In-surance Office in Borisoglebsk, concerning the arrest of his son who, on the grounds of his inexperience and poor health, refused to take part in the work of the Evacuation Commission to which he was assigned by the Commissariat for Agriculture.
p.
169 132Lenin’s note is a reply to Kamenev, who proposed abstaining for a period of two months from “forcing the pace in handing over the whole business of supply .

Kamenev wrote to Lenin: “Don’t call it a concession, call it manoeuvring, and ad-mit that this is precisely the time to manoeuvre.
” p.
169 133This refers to a pamphlet containing the decree on revolutionary legality adopted by the Extraordinary Sixth All-Russia Congress of Soviets on November 8, 1918.
In this decree the Congress called on “all citizens of the Republic, all bodies, all officials of the Soviet authorities, to strictly observe the laws of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
, and the decisions, regulations and instructions issued by the cen-tral authorities”.
All departures from the laws, caused by the con-ditions of the struggle against counter-revolution, were to be kept within strictly defined limits.
The decree outlined measures for waging a determined fight against bureaucracy and red tape in Soviet offices.
The pamphlet appeared in 1919 under the title Observe the Laws of the Soviet Republic! (see also Document 422 of this volume).
p.
170 134This refers to materials concerning a gang of profiteers and bribe-takers, who had wormed their way into Soviet bodies in As-trakhan and disrupted the work of supplying the Soviet troops.
p.
170 135This apparently refers to the operation of a squadron of ships of the Astrakhan-Caspian Naval Flotilla for landing troops at Staroterechnaya in the Kizlyar sector of the Caspian-Caucasian Front.
p.
171 136Towards the end of November 1918 Kolchak’s troops, possessing considerable superiority in strength, launched an offensive against the 3rd Army of the Eastern Front with the aim of uniting with the interventionist troops in the north.
After heavy defensive battles, the 3rd Army was forced to abandon a considerable terri-tory.
The causes for the defeat were: poor supply of clothing, food and ammunition to the army units, lack of the necessary reserves, contamination of some army units by counter-revolutionary elements owing to the violation of the class principle in the forma-tion of units, shortcomings in the army leadership on the part of the commander, M.
M.
Lashevich, and the Revolutionary Military Council of the army.
On this subject see also this volume, Document 242.
p.
171 137The instruction to G.
I.
Petrovsky, People’s Commissar for In-ternal Affairs, was written by Lenin on a telegram he received on December 16, 1918, from peasants of Budilovo village (Yaroslavl Gubernia) complaining against the Chairman of the local Poor Peas-ants’ Committee who had confiscated grain from them although they had no surpluses.
They asked protection of Lenin, as “head of the peasant government”.
p.
173 138Lenin’s note to Sverdlov was written on a telegram from N.
N.
Kuzmin, Military Commissar of the 6th Army, who had reported that Left Socialist-Revolutionary agitation was being conducted among the troops of the Northern Front, as a result of which dis-cipline in some units was deteriorating.
As regards Spiridonova, a leader of the Left Socialist-Revolu-tionary Party, Lenin’s note probably refers to her speeches at out-door and indoor meetings, against Soviet power, against the Bol-sheviks.
On February 24, 1919, the Moscow Revolutionary Tri-bunal examined the case of Maria Spiridonova, who was accused of counter-revolutionary agitation and slander against Soviet power.
The charges against Spiridonova were proved at the trial, but in view of the “morbidly hysterical state of the accused”, the tribunal decided “to isolate Maria Spiridonova from political and social activity for one year by confining her in a sanatorium and affording her an opportunity for healthy physical and mental labour” (Pravda No.
43, February 25, 1919).
p.
173 139This refers to the transfer to the People’s Commissariat for Food of warehouses of industrial and handicraft products, which were at the disposal of the All-Russia Extraordinary Com-mission (Vecheka).
The transfer was to have been made in pursuance of the decree on the organisation of supplies for the population adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars on November 21, 1918.
On December 3, 1918, the Food Commis-sariat asked the Vecheka to turn over the warehouses to the Chief Board for Distribution of Products, but up to December 20 this request remained without reply.
On December 20, the Food Com-missariat applied to the Council of Defence concerning this mat-ter.

A.
Bulatov wired Lenin on December 26, 1918: “Letter re-ceived.
Directive will be carried out.
” In a telegram on December 28, 1918, Bulatov reported that Teterin, a member of the Pervi-tino Poor Peasants’ Committee, had been relieved of his post as being a former gendarme, but the other members of the commit-tee had been left in their posts since the accusations against them were unproven.
On December 31 Bulatov sent Lenin a detailed letter on this matter.

175 142Lenin wrote this telegram in connection with a complaint reaching him from P.
I.
Surkov, a former member of the Social-Democrat-ic group in the Third Duma, against the decision of the Extraor-dinary Commission of the town of Rodniki (Ivanovo-Voznesensk Gubernia) to confiscate his library.
Surkov reported that while objecting to the transfer of the library to Rodniki, he agreed to hand over the books for teaching young people in his own village.
Regarding Surkov’s library, see also documents 228, 229 and 235 in this volume.
p.
175 143In his telegram to Lenin and to the Revolutionary Military Coun-cil of the Republic dated December 26, 1918, Trotsky, com-menting on the apprehensions of Commander-in-Chief Vatsetis regarding fraternisation, wrote of its significance, particularly on the Northern Front, where there were American, British and French troops.
At the same time, in order to put a stop to enemy agita-tion among Red Army men and to prevent the weakening of the fighting efficiency of the Red Army units, the telegram proposed that fraternisation should be carried out in an organised manner under the surveillance and control of responsible functionaries, primarily political commissars.

176 144As a result of the measures taken, the Vyazniki workers received six truck-loads of flour, two of which were for the Yuzhsk factory.

146The question of requisitioning Surkov’s library was discussed on December 27, 1918, at an enlarged sitting of the Executive Com-mittee, the Extraordinary Commission and the Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) of the town of Rodniki.
Its decision noted that “the books in Citizen Surkov’s library, which are of social value, are shut away and unread at a time when there is an immense lack of books for the enlightenment of broad masses of workers and peasants”, and that since a library was being formed in Rodniki “the requisi-tioned books will be of tremendous benefit as public property”.
In order to give Lenin fuller information on this question, the p.
177meeting decided to send A.
N.
Prokofiev, secretary of the local Cheka, to see him.
Lenin received Prokofiev and after a talk with him wrote his letter to the People’s Commissariat for Education.
p.
177 147In reply to Lenin’s letter, V.
Y.
Bryusov, head of the Library Section of the People’s Commissariat for Education, informed him on January 2, 1919, that A.
N.
Prokofiev had been received and heard out in the Library Section.
Bryusov wrote that, accord-ing to existing rules, the requisitioning of libraries could be permitted only with the knowledge and consent of the People’s Commissariat for Education, in order that, when requisitioning takes place, the interests of the state as a whole should be taken into account—primarily the requirements of the large state li-braries: the libraries of the Rumyantsev Museum (now the State Library of the U.
S.
S.
R.
, named after Lenin), the Historical Mu-seum, the Socialist Academy, the universities, and others.
In view of this Prokofiev was asked to submit an inventory of the re-quisitioned library.
On receipt of Bryusov’s memo, Lenin wrote a letter to Pro-kofiev (see this volume, Document 235).

F.
Obraztsov, a peasant from Vasyutino village, Lopatinsk Volost, Vesyegonsk Uyezd, Tver Gubernia, who had been sent to Lenin by village Communists to solicit help in building a village People’s House to replace one that was destroyed by fire at the end of 1917.
On January 18, 1919, after Obraztsov’s return home, the lo-cal newspaper, Izvestia of the Vesyegonsk Soviet of Workers’, Peasants’ and Red Army Deputies, published an article about his reception by Lenin under the heading “A Visit to Comrade p.
180Lenin”.
In it Obraztsov related that his talk with Lenin had dealt chiefly with the policy of the Communist Party and the Soviet Gov-ernment towards the poor and middle peasantry.
In concluding the article, Obraztsov wrote: “Comrade peasants of Vesyegonsk Uyezd! Believe me who saw with my own eyes that there, at the top, our common cause is being administered not by officials or bureau-crats, but by our own, ordinary comrades, who rightly call them-selves the Workers’ and Peasants’ Government.
Let us hearken to their voice.
They are working for us and our children.
Let us help them with all we can in their difficult work.
Then we shall all the sooner see a golden age for us.
Comrades! I hope that it is together with you all that I say loudly: ‘Long live the leader of the proletariat and protector of the poor, our friend and brother Vladimir Ilyich Lenin!!!’ ” p.

182 155This telegram was sent in reply to an inquiry from the Ufa Revolu-tionary Committee to whom the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries had made a proposal to begin negotiations for joint action against Kolchak.
The talks with the Ufa Right Socialist-Revolutionaries were held during January-February 1919 in Ufa and Moscow.
At the end of February, the All-Russia Central Executive Committee adopted a resolution on the attitude towards the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries.
In view of the positive results of the talks and the fact that on February 8, 1919, the party conference of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries declared itself opposed to an armed struggle against Soviet power and to foreign intervention in Russia’s affairs, the All-Russia Central Executive Committee passed a decision to give to the groups of Right Socialist-Revolu-tionaries which adopted this stand the right “to participate in Soviet work”.

V.
Stalin and F.
E.
Dzerzhinsky, which visited the 3rd Army early in January 1919.
Lenin’s directive was written in connection with a letter from Stalin and Dzerzhinsky in which they reported on the opening of the investigation and pointed out that in order to prevent the rapid advance of the enemy, it was essential to send urgently three reliable regiments to reinforce the 3rd Army.

185 157In reply to Lenin’s telegram, Kornev, Chairman of the Ryazan Gubernia Executive Committee, reported that at a sitting of the Presidium of the Gubernia Executive Committee and the Presid-ium of the City Executive Committee on January 15, 1919, it had been decided to urgently organise a Department of Public Catering under the City Executive Committee which was to take p.
186 charge of all Ryazan’s dining-rooms and tea-rooms.
158This telegram was prompted by a telegram that Lenin received on January 12, 1919, at about 7 p.
m.
, from four workers who com-plained that the Gavrilov Posad Extraordinary Commission had confiscated 16 poods of oats from them, and asked for orders to be given for their return.
p.
187 159Lenin wrote this instruction to the secretary on a telegram to the Council of Defence from Pashkov, Chief of the Railway Militia of a district in Tula Gubernia, who reported on the progress of snow clearing on the railway, and gave factual data on the number of workers and carts engaged in this work.
p.
187 160Lenin’s directives to Tsyurupa were written on the memorandum of the Education Commissariat’s Inter-Departmental Commission for the Purchase of Food for the Children of Moscow and Petro-grad.
The memorandum outlined measures for the better food provision of the children, specifically, the organisation and hold-ing of a Starving Children’s Week for obtaining produce in rural localities in exchange for commodities, and for delivery of this produce to the towns.
p.
188 161The document referred to has not been found.

Vladimirov, Military Commissar Extraordinary of the Rail-ways of the Southern Front, reporting the state of affairs on the railways under his control.
Appended to the letter was the draft of an addendum to the decision of the Council of Defence dated December 22, 1918, on the question of combating snowdrifts.
p.
189 164On January 18, 1919, the Council of People’s Commissars adopted a decision on the fuel and food situation at state engineering works.

188165This refers to a proposed conference on the Princes Islands (Sea of Marmora) with the participation of representatives of all the governments existing on the territory of Russia to draw up meas-ures for ending the Civil War.
The address to the parties to the conference was drafted by Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States.
The imperialists started this talk about a conference in order to halt the advance of the Red Army and, in the event of the Soviet Government refusing to participate in the confer-ence, to put the blame on it for the continuation of hostilities.
The Soviet Government unmasked the imperialists who were posing as “peace-makers”; on February 4, 1919, it issued a radio statement to the governments of Great Britain, France, Italy, the United States and Japan agreeing to participate in the conference, which it intended to use as an international platform to expose the interventionists.
But no reply was forthcoming from the Entente imperialists.
Denikin, Kolchak and other counter-revo-lutionary governments still hoped to crush the Soviet Republic by force of arms, and therefore refused to take part in the confe-rence, which was never held.

M.
Smirnov, a Right Socialist-Revolutionary and former mayor of the town under the White Czechs, who gave himself up to the Soviet authorities and declared his intention of working with “Soviet power” for the purpose of fighting against Kolchak.
Schwartz reported that Smirnov put forward no condi-tions for his work in the future and was backed by a group of individuals from his camp who had decided to serve Soviet power.
On the telegram from Samara, Lenin wrote the words: “For handy reference.

192 168Lenin’s note to Krasin, People’s Commissar for Trade and Industry, was written in connection with a report by W.
Jas-trzembski, a former leader of the Polish Socialist Party, who was then in Russia, on the results of his journey to Warsaw under-taken to explore the possibility of establishing trade and cultural relations between the Soviet Republic and Poland.
Owing to the resistance of the Right-wing leaders of the Polish Socialist Party, his mission was unsuccessful.
Despite this Lenin was in favour of continuing negotiations.

The telegram stated that this train had left Petrograd for Yamburg and was sent simultaneously to a large number of addresses.
p.
193 171On February 6, 1919, Shlyapnikov reported to Lenin informa-tion he had received from Baku to the effect that the workers of Baku enterprises and the sailors were hostile towards the Brit-ish occupationists, that the ships, on which there were still Rus-sian sailors, were ready to go over to the side of the Soviets, and that the Baku workers would start an uprising to coincide with the Red Army attack.
p.
193 172Lenin’s instruction to Petrovsky was written on the text of a report on the situation in Kursk Gubernia presented by an official of the Military Inspection.
The latter reported dissatisfaction among the working people of Kursk Gubernia caused by abuses on the part of local Soviet and Party functionaries, the poor organisation of agitation and propaganda in the countryside and the weakness of the Party organisations in the gubernia.

195 174Lenin’s telegram followed a letter from M.
M.
Fedoseyev from the village of Azeyevo, Yelatma Uyezd, Tambov Gubernia.
Fe-doseyev stated that in October 1918 his printing-press in the town of Yelatma was nationalised and now stood “ in a shed, rusting away and idle”, at a time when the uyezd town of Yelatma was without a printing-press and orders were being sent to towns in other uyezds.
Fedoseyev wrote that he was “not a bourgeois”, that for 27 years he had worked as a clerk, secretary, teacher, and book-keeper; that after buying on credit an old, broken-down printing-press, he had put it in order and had himself worked in the print-shop as proofreader and compositor.
On Fedoseyev’s letter Lenin wrote the words: “Wired 18.
II”, “file away for handy reference”.
p.
195 175In reply to Lenin’s telegram, P.
Gorbunov, Chairman of the Yela-tma Uyezd Executive Committee, reported the same day that the E.

intended to merge Fedoseyev’s printing-press with an-other nationalised local printing-press (of Meshcheryakov), where both Fedoseyev and Meshcheryakov, as specialists, would be allowed to work.
p.
195 176A telegram from Headquarters of the Eastern Front on Februa-ry 19, 1919, reported on talks with representatives of the Bashkir bourgeois-nationalist government for the cessation of this govern-ment’s anti-Soviet activity and for the Bashkir troops fightingalongside Red Army units against Kolchak.
The opinion was ex-pressed in the telegram that if the Bashkir troops would immedi-ately go over to an offensive against Kolchak they should not be disarmed, but if they were to refuse to do so, then it was essential to disarm them.
Joint operations by Bashkir units and the Red Army against whiteguard troops began at the end of February 1919, and a Bash-kir Revolutionary Committee was set up.
On March 20, 1919, the Government of the R.

Ramensky (a colleague of I.

Ulyanov—Lenin’s father) he presented to a delegation of teachers from Tver Gubernia.
The delegation had come to Moscow to ask for help in the form of food for Tver teachers.
Lenin’s pamphlet contained the text of his report on combat-ing the famine delivered at a joint session of the All-Russia Cen-tral Executive Committee, the Moscow Soviet, and the trade uni-ons on June 4, 1918, and his reply to the debate on the report p.
197 (see present edition, Vol.

Y.
Tsekhanovsky, Chairman of the Rudnya Executive Committee, Mikulino Volost, Orsha Uyezd, Mogilev Gubernia.
Tsekhanovsky wrote that the Mikulino Communists had organised a central volost workers’ co-operative for the purpose of “uniting workers and peasants on the basis of a communist system of trade, abolishing private trading and pillage, and reconstructing exist-ing kulak-dominated consumer co-operatives”; the Rules of this workers’ co-operative had been examined in the Supreme Econom-ic Council.
Reporting that leaders of the uyezd and gubernia organisations in Orsha and Mogilev were opposed to the activities of the Mikulino Communists, Tsekhanovsky asked permission to report to Lenin personally “on the state of affairs as the leader of communism and defender of the proletariat”.

p.
199 180Written by Lenin on a note from A.
I.
Svidersky, member of the Board of the People’s Commissariat for Food, apparently at a meeting of the Council of People’s Commissars.
Svidersky wrote that the Food Commissariat had been discussing whether to con-sider the frontier with the Ukraine open for free transport of all food products or only of those that were unrationed.
The organisation of food supply in the liberated districts of the Ukraine at the beginning of 1919 was a very important mat-ter.
Lenin devoted great attention to this question; in particular, he proposed to hasten Schlichter’s departure to the Ukraine, where he was to head the People’s Commissariat for Food.
On February 25, 1919, Lenin wrote on a telegram from Pyatakov, who reported on food stocks in the Ukraine: “Inform Schlichter, adding that I am extremely dissatisfied at the delay of his journey” (A.
Schlichter, Uchitel i drug trudyashchikhsya [Teacher and Friend of the Working People], Moscow, 1957, p.
55).

Requests for Pershikova’s release were sent in telegrams to Lenin from V.
S.
Usachov, chief of one of the Tsaritsyn militia stations, and from Minin, a Red Army man.
On Minin’s telegram Lenin wrote the following instruction to his secretary: “Remind me when the reply comes from the Chair-man of the Extraordinary Commission (and afterwards hand all the material over to the topical satirists).

201186On January 29, 1919, the Second Congress of Soviets of Sarapul Uyezd, Vyatka Gubernia, adopted a decision to collect grain in all villages of the uyezd as a gift to Moscow and Petrograd.
The Congress decided that the gift of 40,000 poods of grain for Moscow “be dispatched and presented personally to our dear and beloved leader, Comrade Lenin”.
Lenin’s note was written following his reception of the delegation of Sarapul peasants who had accom-panied the train-load of grain.
It was written, apparently, not on March 12 as indicated in the document, but on March 11, 1919.
This is borne out by the following circumstances.
Already on March 12 Pravda No.
55 reported that Kamenev, speaking at a plenary meeting of the Moscow Soviet on March 11, said: “I re-ceived a letter from Comrade Lenin who had been visited by repre-sentatives of Sarapul Uyezd, Vyatka Gubernia, who had brought 40,000 poods of grain as a gift to Moscow.
These delegates are present at this meeting.
” The mistake about the date is also evident from the fact that on March 12 Lenin was in Petrograd, where he addressed a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet in the Taurida Palace (see present edition, Vol.
29, pp.
19-37).
Lenin himself, speaking on March 13, 1919, at a meeting in the Peo-ple’s House in Petrograd, said: “Only a few days ago a dele-gation of peasants representing five volosts in Sarapul Uyezd came to see me” (ibid.

202 188Lenin gave this instruction to Petrovsky after receiving a com-plaint from peasants of Korbangsk Volost, Kadnikovo Uyezd, Vologda Gubernia, about the incorrect attitude of the Volost Exe-cutive Committee towards the middle peasants.
Lenin wrote the instruction on the following draft of a telegram in Krupskaya’s handwriting: “To the Korbangsk Volost Soviet, Kadnikovo Uyezd Vologda Gubernia.
Draw up immediately in all villages lists of electors to the Soviet, excluding only known kulaks and drawing the middle peasants into the elections.
After compiling the lists, fix new elections to the Soviet.
A check will be carried out.
Those guilty of incorrectly compiling the lists will have to answer for it” (Collected Works, Fifth Ed.
, Vol.
50, p.
476).
Shortly after this, on learning of the rude behaviour of A.
G.
Pravdin, a member of the Board of the People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs, towards U.
P.
Mostakova, who had delivered the complaint of the Vologda peasants, Lenin wrote to Petrovsky: “.

Pravdin must be hauled over the coals.
Don’t let him have his own way, and put him under supervision, he has a tendency to-wards stupid ‘order issuing’.
This must be put an end to” (ibid).

208 197Lenin’s radio-telegrams to Bela Kun were sent in connection with the news of the proclamation of a Soviet Republic in Munich on April 7, 1919.
At that time it was not yet known in Moscow that the Soviet Republic in Munich had been proclaimed by leadersof the German Social-Democrats and of the Centrist Independent Social-Democratic Party of Germany, who by this manoeuvre wanted to deceive the workers and to discredit the idea of Soviet power.
Conditions in Bavaria not yet being ripe for the proclama-tion of a Soviet Republic, the Bavarian Communists refused to take part in this provocative act of adventurism.
On April 13, 1919, when the Bavarian counter-revolutionaries made an attempt to seize power, a furious struggle took place on the streets of Munich, ending in the victory of the workers.
A So-viet government was set up in Bavaria—the Executive Committee headed by the leader of the Bavarian Communists, Eugene Levin; the government also included Independents.
The Govern-ment of the Bavarian Soviet Republic set about disarming the bourgeoisie, organising a Red Army, nationalising the banks, es-tablishing workers’ control at enterprises, and organising food supply.
On April 27, 1919, Lenin wrote his “Message of Greetings to the Bavarian Soviet Republic”, in which he gave the revolu-tionary government of Bavaria advice in the form of a concrete programme of action for the proletarian party that had come to power (see present edition, Vol.
29, pp.
325-26).
The home and foreign situation of the Bavarian Soviet Repub-lic was a difficult one.
At the very first difficulties encountered by the Soviet Republic the representatives of the “Independent Social-Democrats” began to pursue a treacherous policy.
Towards the end of April, the Independents succeeded in removing the Communists from leading positions.
Taking advantage of this situation the counter-revolutionaries went over to the offensive.
On May 1, whiteguard units entered Munich and after three days’ hard fighting captured the city.
p.
208 198 This telegram was sent in connection with a report from Knya-ginin Uyezd, Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia, addressed to Lenin at the Council of People’s Commissars, stating that the local author-ities were forcibly making the peasants join artels and communes.
The telegram was drafted in the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture.
On April 10, 1919, the following circular letter, signed by Lenin and Sereda, was published in Izvestia: “To all Gubernia Land Departments.
“Copies to Executive Committees.
“Information has reached the People’s Commissariat for Agri-culture that for the purpose of organising state farms, communes and other collective associations, the land departments and state farm boards, contrary to the intent of Article 9 of the Regulations on Socialist Organisation of Agriculture, are taking away from the peasants the lands of former landowners’ estates which had been made over to them.
The impermissibility of such practices is hereby confirmed.
Lands being worked by peasants at the time of the publication of the Regulations on Socialist Organisation of Agriculture, and which were put at their disposal on the basisof decisions or instructions of uyezd or gubernia land departments, may not on any account be forcibly alienated for the purpose of organising state farms, communes or other collective associations.
The alienation of lands from the peasants for the sake of the above-mentioned organisations is permissible only by voluntary consent by way of land tenure regulation.
Measures of coercion to make the peasants practise joint cultivation and join communes and other types of collective farming are impermissible.
The transi-tion to collective forms is to be carried out only in strict conformi-ty with the Regulations, without any compulsion on the part of the authorities.
Non-fulfilment of the present instruction will be punished in accordance with the laws of the revolutionary period.
Inform the population of the present instruction as widely as pos-sible.

A.
Mekhonoshin, Chair-man of the Revolutionary Military Council of the 11th Army, who asked that part of the 33rd Division, which was to be trans-ferred to the Eastern Front, should be left in the Astrakhan area.
Mekhonoshin reported that the transfer of the whole 33rd Divi-sion and the impossibility of a rapid formation of the 34th Divi-sion, owing to the delay in sending promised reinforcements, would compel them to stop the offensive against Kizlyar and give up the idea of capturing Guriev and Rakusha, where there was oil, and would put the fleet, which was threatened with loss of its base, in a hopeless position.
“The absence of precise orders from Field Headquarters,” wrote Mekhonoshin, “puts the army in an absolutely impossible position and gives grounds for accusing us of inactivity.

The letter was dated April 17, 1919.
In it Nansen gave the text of his appeal to the heads of government of the four Entente Powers (U.
S.
A.
, France, Great Britain and Italy) proposing the setting up of a committee to organise aid for Russia with food and medical supplies, and their reply.
In their reply the heads of the Entente Powers (Woodrow Wilson, David Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau and Vittorio Orlando) made this aid con-ditional on the cessation of military operations on the territory of Russia, but without indicating whether this condition would be binding on the powers who were pursuing a policy of armed intervention against the Soviet Republic.
Nansen had obviously failed to see through the manoeuvres of the Entente leaders and expressed his agreement with the conditions they had put for-ward.
On the same day, May 4, Lenin informed Chicherin that this question had been referred to the Political Bureau of the Cen-tral Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) and asked him to draft a reply to Nansen, emphasising the need to expose the imperialists.
Lenin’s letter published here contains his remarks on the draft reply to Nansen.

224 220William Bullitt, the American diplomat, came to Soviet Russia in March 1919 to ascertain the conditions on which the Soviet Gov-ernment would agree to conclude peace with the Entente countries as well as with the whiteguard governments on Russian territory.
Proposals emanating from the U.
S.
President, Woodrow Wilson, and the British Prime Minister, Lloyd George, were transmitted through Bullitt.
The Soviet Government, striving for the speediestconclusion of peace, agreed to negotiations on the proposed terms, introducing into them, however, some essential amendments (for the text of the peace proposal drafted by the U.
S.
government representative, Bullitt, and the Government of the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
, see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.
II, 1958, pp.
91-95).
Shortly after Bullitt’s departure from Soviet Russia, Kolchak succeeded in achieving some successes on the Eastern Front, and the imperialist governments, anticipating the collapse of the Soviet state, refused peace negotiations.
Wilson forbade publication of the draft agreement brought by Bullitt, and Lloyd George, in a speech in Parliament, declared that he had nothing to do with the negotiations with the Soviet Government.
p.
225 221Lenin’s remarks on the draft replies to Nansen were fully taken into account in the radio-telegram of May 7, 1919 (see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.
II, 1958, pp.
154-60).
The plan put forward by Nansen came to nothing.

p.
229 224This refers to the counter-revolutionary revolt of Ataman Gri-goriev, which broke out at the beginning of May 1919 in the rear of the Soviet troops in the Ekaterinoslav and Kherson gubernias.
The revolt directly threatened the flank and rear of the Soviet troops in the Donets Basin and the rear communications of units of the 2nd Ukrainian Army in the Crimea, and also hindered rail-way transport throughout the Ukraine.
In the period from May 11 to 24, by simultaneous blows from the east, north and south, the troops of the Ukrainian armies routed the insurgents.
p.
230 225On April 24, 1919, the Council of People’s Commissars adopted the decree “On Organising Migration to the Producing Gubernias and the Don Region”.

The first part of the telegram is a typewritten text, apparently written by Chicherin since there is a note by him to the document saying: “To Comrade Lenin.

heard a report by A.
I.
Svidersky, a member of the Board of the People’s Commissariat for Food on the state of grain procurements and on plans for the food pro-curement campaign before the next harvest.
The Council decided to publish Svidersky’s report in the form of an article and to transmit abroad by radio a short communication about it with statistical data.
Lenin’s instruction to the secretary was written on the text of the prepared radio-information, which stressed that, in spite of extremely adverse conditions (lack of commodities, devalua-tion of the currency, seizure by whiteguards of the main grain-growing regions), procurements of grain in 1919 were proceeding more successfully than in the previous year: the Soviet food sup-ply organisations collected 102 million poods of grain during the nine months (from August 1918 to April 1919) compared with only 28 million poods during the ten months (from November 1917 to August 1918) Svidersky’s article “Immediate Food Prospects” was pub-lished in Izvestia for June 3 and 4, 1919.
p.

Lenin wrote to Sklyansky: “Stalin demands the recall of Okulov, whom he accuses of intrigues and disorganisation.
” In answer to a note of Sklyansky’s giving a favourable testimonial of Okulov, Lenin gave the following directive to Sklyansky: “Then draft the text of a telegram (a precise statement of what the 7th Army is accused by Okulov) and I will send a code message to Stalin and Zinoviev to keep the conflict within bounds and chan-nel it in the right direction.
” The draft of the telegram published here was drawn up in accordance with this directive and after-wards supplemented and signed by Lenin.

Fort Seraya Loshad, which had joined the rebels, also fell during the day of June 16.
Only a few hours before the mutiny was suppressed, the Soviet command received information that a British naval force of 23 ships had set out from Libau to aid the Krasnaya Gorka mutineers.
In view of thefact, however, that the Soviet fleet dominated the sea approaches to Petrograd, the British command did not venture to begin large scale operations and was compelled to limit the activities of its squadron to isolated actions.

255 247Lenin wrote this letter in connection with the strike of workers at a number of enterprises of Tver Gubernia.
The strike, which broke out in the middle of June 1919 and lasted several days, was caused by dissatisfaction among the workers over the reduc-tion of the bread ration and food supplies.
Counter-revolutionary elements tried to take advantage of the economic difficulties of the Soviet Republic in order to inflame anti-Soviet sentiments.
The question of the food strikes was discussed at joint meet-ings of the Politbureau and Orgbureau of the C.

The Gubernia Congress of Soviets decided to ask the C.

Housing belonging to the works could be made over to other institutions only by an order of the Council of Defence; hence the application of the Sormovo Women’s Organisation was forwarded to Lenin.
Lenin’s directive was con-sidered at a meeting of the Presidium of the Sormovo Soviet on July 18.
The matter was referred for a final decision to the Pre-sidium of the Nizhni-Novgorod Gubernia Executive Committee,which decided to meet the request of the Sormovo Women’s Organisation.

Before putting the matter before the Council of Defence, Lenin asked the All-Russia Chief Head-quarters for information about reinforcements sent to the Southern Front.
In reply to Lenin’s telegram of July 8, the Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern Front repeated its request.
On July 11, 1919, the Council of Defence decided “to permit the R.

According to this plan, the main attack was to be delivered by the left wing of the South-ern Front via the Don Region with a secondary attack in the Khar-kov direction.
The plan was expounded in a directive of the Su-preme Command dated July 23, 1919 (see Iz istorii grazhdanskoi voiny v SSSR, Vol.

OnAugust 10, 1919, Mamontov’s cavalry broke through the front in the vicinity of Novokhopersk and raided a number of towns and villages.
This created a threat to the Soviet forces, made offen-sive operations difficult, and upset the system of command and supply in various places.
Lenin considered it an urgent task to organise the rout of Mamontov’s corps (see Collected Works, Fifth Ed.

Obvious-ly, the telegram pointed out, the Lithuanians had used talk about negotiations as a cover in order to lull the vigilance of the Soviet Government.
Stalin stated that he had not received any decisions of the Central Committee about conducting negotiations.
“Today,” he wrote further, “our counter-offensive has begun.
We have is-sued an order to Front Headquarters to heighten vigilance and not allow any envoys to pass the front line without its knowl-edge and consent.

293 286Lenin is referring to the decision of the Council of Defence dated October 16, 1919.
It contained a directive to defend Petrograd to the last drop of blood, without yielding an inch of ground and fighting in the streets.
In his proposed plan of struggle against Yudenich’s forces, Trotsky also spoke of the need to prepare for street fighting in the city.
But, in issuing its main directive for holding Petrograd at all costs until the arrival of reinforce-ments, the Council of Defence allowed for street fighting only if the enemy succeeded in penetrating into the city, whereas Trotsky’s argument was different.
He asserted that “for purely military considerations” it would be advantageous to allow the enemy to break into Petrograd which should therefore be converted into “a big trap for the whiteguard troops”.

By organising local forces, we shall cope with Kolchak; all that is needed are uniforms and cartridges.
Yesterday we went over to the offensive along the whole front, and expect to reach the Ishim in three weeks”.
Further, mention was made of the desire of the Communists of the 5th Army that the army be transferred to the Southern Front.
Smirnov proposed that after the Ishim three divisions of this army should be transferred to the south.
“If you provide uniforms for 30,000,” he wrote, “we shall immediately mobilise this number of soldiers in Chelyabinsk and the place to which we are going.
Send only uniforms; we have and will have all the manpower” (under-linings by Lenin) (Collected Works, Fifth Ed.

The Urals White Cossack army of General Tolstov, being adjacent to the right flank of Denikin’s front, was in a position to make contact with Denikin’s forces.
It operated in the North Caspian area and diverted to itself troops of the Turkestan Front as well as part of the forces of the 11th Army of the South-Eastern Front.

At the end of January and beginning of February, the Reserve Army of the Republic and units of the 2nd Army were drawn into the work of economic construction, the troops of the8th Army in March, and certain other military formations somewhat later.
With the outbreak of the war against bourgeois-landowner Poland and Wrangel, the labour armies had to be switched back to battle readiness.

333 333Lenin’s telegram was written in connection with the attempt by Bashkir bourgeois nationalists to carry out a coup d’état in Bashkiria in January 1920.
The bourgeois nationalist A.
-Z.
A.
Va-lidov and a group of his followers who, under pressure from the working people, came over to the side of Soviets in February 1919, had not changed their views or abandoned their aim to secure bourgeois autonomy for Bashkiria.
In the summer of 1919 the Validov group set up a “Provision-al Central Bureau of the Communists of Bashkiria” headed by Yumagulov, who was at the same time Chairman of the Revolu-tionary Committee organised by the Validov group.
Validov’s “Bureau” tried to assume leadership of the Party organisations of Bashkiria although it had not been endorsed by the Central Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
).
In January 1920, on the proposal of Validov’s supporter, K.
M.
Rakai, the Bashkir Revolutionary Committee set up a Foreign Relations Department.
When the Party Regional Committee on January 13, 1920, condemned this step and resolved to recall Rakai from the posts he held, the Chair-man of the Revolutionary Committee, Yumagulov, tried to carry out a coup d’état.
On the night of January 13, 1920, by his order the members of the Party Regional Committee and other Commu-nists were arrested, and a manifesto was issued accusing them of conspiring against the Bashkir Republic.
The telegram of the C.
E.
C.
of January 20, 1920, mentioned by Lenin, stated: “In view of the friction between the Bashkir Revolutionary Committee and the Ufa Gubernia Revolutionary Committee, and your accusation against Comrade Eltsin of deviat-ing from the policy of the central government, the C.

p.
333 334This refers to the stand taken by the Siberian Revolutionary Committee and the Revolutionary Military Council of the 5th Army in the talks which took place on January 19, 1920, with a delegation from the “Political Centre”, which was formed from representatives of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, Zem-stvo members and co-operators at an all-Siberia conference of Zemstvos and towns held in Irkutsk on November 12, 1919.
When, on January 5, 1920, Irkutsk passed into the hands of the insurgent workers, soldiers and peasants, the “Political Centre” announced that it had assumed power in the city.
The real organs of power in Irkutsk, however, were the headquarters of the armed workers’ and peasants’ detachments and the Military Revolutionary Com-mittee, which acted under the leadership of the Irkutsk Committee of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
).
The question of doing away with the “Political Centre” was not raised at once, since it was trusted to some ex-tent by a section of the population and had the support of consid-erable forces of the interventionists in Irkutsk Gubernia and the Trans-Baikal area.
The “Political Centre” aimed at the creation of a “democratic” bourgeois state in Eastern Siberia.
At the talks with the Siberian Revolutionary Committee, its delegation pro-posed that the further advance eastward of the 5th Army should be halted and that a buffer state should be set up in Eastern Si-beria, but the Siberian Revolutionary Committee insisted on its own conditions, namely, that the Red Army advance to Baikal and a buffer state be organised in the Trans-Baikal area.
Meanwhile the balance of forces in Irkutsk underwent a radical change, one which was not to the advantage of the “Political Centre ” .
On January 21, 1920, all power in Irkutsk passed into the hands of the Revolutionary Committee.
p.
334 335This refers to the troops of the Czechoslovak Corps, which in 1918-19 were used by the Entente imperialists and the Russian whiteguards as a strike force against the Soviets, and now were retreating under the blows of the Red Army.
On January 19, 1920, the Czechoslovak Corps command announced that it was ceasing military operations and was ready to enter into negotia-tions for a truce with the Soviet army command.
Soviet envoys went to Taishet railway station to present the terms for a truce but the White Czechoslovak command refused to negotiate.
The truce was not signed until February 7.

On the letter Lenin wrote: “To be kept in the dossier on ROSTA.
” On February 21, 1920, in connection with a letter from the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs about the irresponsible statement of a Moscow journalist speaking on the radio on questions of Soviet foreign policy, Lenin again wrote to Kerzhentsev: “Why was this not sent for censorship?

341 344In the beginning of February 1920 preparations were made for a new offensive of the Red Army on the Caucasian Front.
At the same time there was a lack of co-ordination between the armies of the front.
The Mounted Army had been weakened in previous engagements; exhaustion of the troops and shortage of supplies were acutely felt.
Owing to a relaxation of political and education-al work, instances of infringement of military discipline began to occur in the units.
The Composite Cavalry Corps, which co-operated with the 1st Mounted Army, was seriously affected.
Counter-revolutionary elements were active at Corps Headquarters.
On the night of February 2, Corps Commissar, V.
N.
Mikeladze, was murdered by counter-revolutionaries.
All these circumstances in conjunc-tion with the extremely complex military situation caused Lenin great anxiety, since they jeopardised the Red Army’s offensive in the Northern Caucasus, the aim of which was the final defeat of the enemy.

The formation of the F.

At that time the situation in Usolye was rather grave.
Shortly before this, a new front—the Kai-Cherdyn Front—had been formed there.
Remnants of Kolchak’s forces and northern interventionists had organised bands in Cherdyn, where they had used the connections of the recently abolished Kolchak regime and exploited the dissatisfaction caused by the stupid bungling of some of the local Party officials who had antagonised the Zyryan people as well.
As far as I remember, the Perm Gu-bernia Committee, on receiving Lenin’s letter, sent a man to Usolye to ascertain the state of affairs on the spot, after which a commission was set up which reviewed the composition of the leading bodies and changed it at a specially convened Party con-ference.

356 364The Ukrainian petty-bourgeois nationalist Borotba Party arose in May 1918 after the split in the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party.
It got its name from the central organ of the party—the newspaper Borotba (Struggle).
The Borotbists twice applied to the Executive Committee of the Communist International to be allowed to affiliate to the Communist International.
On February 26, 1920, the Communist International by a special decision called on the Borotbists to dissolve their party and merge with the C.
P.
(B.

Owing to the growing influence of the Bolsheviks among the mass of the peasants and the successes of Soviet power in the Ukraine, the Borotbists at their conference in the middle of March 1920 were compelled to pass a decision to dissolve their party.
A decision to admit the Borotbists to membership of the Ukrain-ian C.

Three hundred million rubles in gold were earmarked for this purpose.
Lenin’s note was appar-ently written at this meeting.
p.
358 366Lenin wrote this note on Krasin’s letter concerning the purchase of locomotives from American trusts.
Krasin wrote that there were only three trusts in the U.
S.
A.
from which locomotives could be obtained.
It was intended to start an immediate corres-pondence with them by radio from Scandinavia or London.
Era-sin, however, expressed the fear that as a result of this publicity a “host” of middlemen would spring up between him and these trusts as the main suppliers, and that this would not only send the price up but also delay delivery.
p.
358 367Lenin urged the need for intensified and uninterrupted work on locomotive repairs in view of the catastrophic state of railway transport, and this problem was repeatedly discussed by the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Defence.
Thus, on February 5, 1920, the C.
P.

heard a report by Krasin on spe-cial privileges for workers engaged in locomotive repairs and the production of spare parts for transport.
On February 27, the Council of Defence discussed non-fulfilment by the People’s Com-missariat for Food of the decree granting bonuses to workers who repaired trains in their spare time.

In 1918, the former owners of a publishing house and print-shop, in order to prevent them from being nationalised, organised a bogus co-operative which obtained orders from various institutions by fraudulent means.
The matter was in-vestigated by the Extraordinary Commission in accordance with Lenin’s directive.

On Lenin’s motion this question was discussed by the Council of People’s Commissars on April 20, 1920.
In accordance with its decision, the present telegram was sent to the Council of the 1st Labour Army.

In the spring of 1920, V.

R.
to allow him to come to the Ukraine and to give him an opportunity of actively partici-pating in the struggle against the White Poles and Wrangel, as well as in building the Soviet Ukraine.
In view of the fact that Vinnichenko and other nationalist leaders had the backing of a considerable number of Ukrainian émigrés, and in order to win away from them elements belonging to the working people who had been misled, it was decided to draw Vinnichenko into Soviet work.

372 383This note to Trotsky was written on Chicherin’s letter to Lenin dated May 4, 1920, informing him about Lord Curzon’s radio message.
The message suggested a general amnesty and a concil-iatory attitude to the defeated whiteguards and spoke of a ces-sation of military operations in the Crimea and the Caucasus.
In Chicherin’s opinion, the proposal for direct talks with Wrangel with the participation of a British officer would be found distaste-ful by every real whiteguard and was a step towards practical recognition of Soviet Russia by Great Britain.
Chicherin pro-posed “agreeing to an amnesty for Wrangel and to halting further penetration into the Caucasus, where we have already captured everything of importance, and we can reply by giving our consent without a moment’s delay”.

Lenin’s addendum relates to the first four points of the “Statute”, which state that “the purpose of the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars is to work up questions which have to be dealt with by the Council of People’s Commissars and require preliminary treatment.
The destination of business reach-ing the Council of People’s Commissars is decided by the Nar-row Council, except for budgetary business, which must be handled by the Narrow Council, and matters coming before the Narrow Council by decision of the Council of People’s Commissars”.

p.
381 395Written on Stalin’s telegram from Kremenchug dated June 4, 1920, and apparently received by Lenin during a sitting of the Council of Labour and Defence.
The telegram reported General Wrangel’s intention to attack with one group of troops in the Alyoshki-Kherson area, and to land another group in the Odessa area so as to envelop it from two sides.
On receiving Trotsky’s note saying that Stalin had violated the established rules by addressing himself directly to Lenin (since such information should have been sent to the Commander-in-Chief by A.

The Soviet Government’s Note in reply to the British Govern-ment, which was worded according to Lenin’s directive and sent by radio on June 11, stated: “True, at the present time it is Wran-gel with his whiteguards, and not a British general, who is attack-ing Russia anew, but the weapons and ammunition which he uses were supplied to him by the British Government and other Allied Governments-his strategic movements have taken place under the protection of British and other Allied vessels, he has received the coal he needed from Great Britain, and the Allied fleet partly helped him in his landing operations and partly di-rectly participated in them.
The Russian Government, therefore, cannot share the point of view of the British Government that the latter bears no responsibility for this new attack on Soviet Russia.

Avanti!—a daily newspaper, the central organ of the Italian Socialist Party, founded in Rome in December 1896.
During the First World War, the newspaper adopted an inconsistent interna-tionalist position, without breaking its ties with the reformists.
In 1926 the paper was closed down by Mussolini’s fascist govern-ment, but continued to be published abroad; in 1943 its publica-tion was resumed in Italy.

Pavlov, the founder of the materialist theory of higher nervous activity in animals and man.
Lenin took a solici-tous interest in his well-being and gave him every possible assist-ance and support In view of Pavlov’s outstanding scientific services, which were of tremendous importance for the working people of theworld, the Soviet Government, on the initiative of Lenin, in the hard years of economic dislocation and the immense difficulties resulting from the Civil War and foreign armed intervention, passed a special decree creating facilities that would enable Aca-demician Pavlov and his assistants to effectively carry on their scientific work (see present edition, Vol.
32, p.
69).
In his well-known letter to Soviet youth written shortly be-fore his death, Pavlov touched on the immense opportunities which the Soviet socialist system offered for the development of culture and science.
“Our country,” he wrote, “is affording great scope to scientists and—it must be owned—science in our country is being fostered with a generous hand.
A most lavish hand! “What is there to say about the status of our young scientist? Here surely everything is quite clear.
Much is given to him, but much is expected from him.
For the youth, as for us, it is a point of honour to justify the great trust that our country puts in science.

417In speaking of Wijnkoop’s statement, Lenin is referring to the letter from him of June 30, 1920, about the book “Left-Wing” Com-munism—an Infantile Disorder, with which the Dutch delegation became acquainted at the Second Congress of the Communist International before translations of the Russian text had been published.
Wijnkoop’s letter and Lenin’s reply to it were first published in the English translation of the book, issued in Mos-cow in 1920, and in the Russian text of the book in 1930 in the second edition of Lenin’s Collected Works (see present edition, p.

418Written in connection with a letter from the Cinema Department of the People’s Commissariat for Education, which reported that the fulfilment of Lenin’s directive—for making a motion picture of “The Trial of the Kolchak Ministers”—was being held up owing to the absence of film.
Lenin sent similar letters to Centrosoyuz, the Moscow Extra-ordinary Commission, the People’s Commissariat for Military Affairs and the Vecheka.
On July 9 a reply was received from the Vecheka addressed to the secretary of the Council of People’s Commissars, Lydia Fotieva, reading: “Dear Comrade Fotieva, please tell Vladimir Ilyich that there is no cinema film in the Vecheka, other than shot films of a counter-revolutionary nature which cannot be used.
Apparently, someone who did not know the facts has misled Ilyich ” (Collected Works, Fifth Ed.

420This refers to Kamenev’s letter of July 9, 1920, concerning the nature of the Anglo-Russian talks, in which he wrote that politi-cal negotiations should be conducted “on the broadest agitational lines” recounting “widely and publicly the whole history of the intervention, including Kolchak, Denikin, Poland, Wrangel, p.
398Lithuania, Estonia, etc.
, etc.
, and touching on and raising all the questions of Eastern policy from Turkey to China”.
In his postscript to this letter Chicherin supported Kamenev, who in turn again put forward the proposal— “ without breaking off the negotiations, and in a mild tone, to present to Lloyd George the history of British plundering on a world scale”.
When Lenin read the letter, he wrote on it: “I disagree in principle.

To eliminate duplication of work and ensure effective use and proper distribution of all existing book-collections, the draft stipulated that “the libraries of all public organisations and institutions are to be merged in the general library network of the Educational Departments”.
All libraries newly opened by public organisations were to be in-cluded “in the general network of public libraries”.
The draft decree also bears a note from Krupskaya to the People’s Commissariat for Education: “If you will send me my article on the centralisation of libraries and return this draft, I will try to make a new draft and write an instruction.
But per-haps it has already been done? In that case, send it as well.

This frontier was to run along the line: Grodno—Yalovka—Nemirov—Brest-Litovsk —Dorogusk—Ustilug—Krylov, and was to cut across Galicia between Przemysl and Rava-Russkaya up to the Carpathian Moun-tains.
This line was mentioned also in Lord Curzon’s Note of July 11, 1920, and became known as the “Curzon Line”.
The Soviet Government, in proposing peace to Poland, was ready to accept as the Polish-Soviet frontier a line east of the “Curzon Line ” .

On September 21, the conference resumed its work in Riga.
The peace negotiations ended with the signing in Riga on October 12, 1920, of “A Treaty on an Armistice and Preliminary Conditions of Peace” between Soviet Russia and the Soviet Ukraine, on the one hand, and Poland, on the other (see Dokumenty vneshnei politiki SSSR, Vol.

418 436 The summer of 1920 saw the beginning of the liberation of the Western Ukraine by the Red Army.
The rule of the bourgeoisie and landowners was abolished in 16 uyezds of Eastern Galicia and Soviet power was established there.
A provisional regional Soviet authority in Eastern Galicia—the Galician Revolution-ary Committee headed by V.
P.
Zatonsky—was set up in Ter-nopol.
In the uyezds, local revolutionary committees were formed, which strove to enforce the decrees of the people’s govern-ment.
Lenin warmly welcomed the establishment of Soviet powerin Eastern Galicia and helped the Galician Communists in their Party and Soviet activities.
p.
419 437Proletcult—a cultural and educational organisation which arose in September 1917 as an independent workers’ organisation.
Its leadership was in the hands of A.
A.
Bogdanov and his support-ers.
After the October Revolution, Proletcult continued to uphold its “independence”, thus setting itself in opposition to the Soviet state.
In consequence, Proletcult was infiltrated by bourgeois intellectuals who began to exert a decisive influence on it.
Its members actually denied the importance of the cultural heritage, wanted to shut themselves off from the tasks of cultural and edu-cational work among the masses, and tried to create a special “proletarian culture” by “laboratory methods”, in isolation from life.
In a draft resolution “On Proletarian Culture” (see present edition, Vol.
31, pp.
316-17) and in a number of other works, Lenin trenchantly criticised the erroneous principles of Prolet-cult.
In the early 1920s its organisations began to decline and in 1932 it ceased to exist.
p.
419 438This refers to the landing in the Kuban area in the middle of August 1920 of a whiteguard force, organised by Wrangel with the consent and support of the Entente.
The aim of the raid was to cut off from the Soviet Republic one of the most fertile grain areas of the country.
As a result of stubborn, fierce battles, the Red Army routed the whiteguard units and in the beginning of September the remnants of the landing force were thrown back into the Crimea.

, C.
P.

U.

Vanderlip arrived in Moscow on September 17, 1920, to ne-gotiate an agreement for the concessions.
On the same day Chi-cherin wrote to Lenin suggesting that negotiations with Vanderlip be started at once and setting out his views on the subject.
Lenin wrote on this letter: “Comrade Chicherin, I am wholly in favour of negotiations.
Hasten them.
Think over what more should be done for directives to Krasnoshchokov.
” (Collected Works, Fifth Ed.
, Vol.
51, p.
448.
) An inter-departmental commission of representatives of the Supreme Economic Council, the People’s Commissariat for For-eign Affairs and the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade, was set up to conduct the negotiations.
In agreeing to offer a concession to Vanderlip’s syndicate, the Soviet Government aimed not only at establishing mutually profitable co-operation with American business circles, but also at normalising relations between Soviet Russia and the U.
S.
A.
In a letter to the Vander-lip syndicate on November 1, 1920, Chicherin pointed out: “In-dependently of the signing of a concession agreement, the Govern-ment of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic as-sumes that the agreement will come into force only on the resump-tion of normal de facto relations between the Government of Russia and the Government of the U.
S.
A.
, and on condition that such relations will be established before July 1, 1921.

P.
(B.

Preobrazhensky on the basis of his report dealing with signs of demoralisation in the Party.
Commenting on this draft, Krestinsky wrote: “I consider that the reservation contained at the end of point V, which speaks of eliminating inequality in living conditions, ‘in so far as they are not due to the require-ments of the work’, should be elaborated as a separate point or, perhaps, even as a separate section of the circular.
“The point is that the living conditions of gubernia Party and Soviet officials are very hard, especially now that we are carrying out transfers on a mass scale and tearing most comrades away from the places where they had all kinds of family connec-tions and links with the countryside.
“The comrades are suffering hunger, and since, in addition, they are overworked, they very soon become exhausted and put out of action for a long time or permanently.
It is essential to get the mass of Party members to recognise the need of estab-lishing somewhat better, less famished conditions of life for the small number of active revolutionary cadres.
“If the above idea is sufficiently emphasised and elaborated in the circular, the last two lines of the draft, which very cautious-ly and not very intelligibly condemn demagogy on the grounds of inequality, will become superfluous.
“In the discussion in the commission, Comrade Preobrazhen-sky did not deny the need to include in the circular the idea of a certain inevitable temporary inequality, but he somehow failed to make his point.

The gist of Yakovlev’s proposals was this: “A secret organisation of officers has been formed in Wran-gel’s army aimed at blowing up Wrangel from within and handing over his whole army to the Soviet government.
In the organisation there are some thirty General Staff officers.
The organisation intends to overthrow Wrangel and proclaim his army the Red Crimean Army under the command of Brusilov.
The Russian Government is asked to give real guarantees of a full amnesty for the whole army without exception, and issue a corresponding proclamation by the Commander-in-Chief.
As proof of the seriousness of the proposal, Yakovlev is prepared to give away the leaders of Wrangel’s organisation operating in Soviet Russia with the aim.

of preparing an armed uprising.
Temporarily, until the arrival of Brusilov, the command of the Red Crimean Army will be en-trusted to General Staff officer Sokolovsky, leader of the conspi-p.

The Congress was preceded by a struggle between the revolutionary wing in the party—the Marxist Left wing— and the Right-wing reformist leadership.
The Congress was attended by 321 persons, all supporters of the Left wing.
At that time the party had more than 4,800 functioning organisations and almost 500,000 members.
The Left wing at the Congress took over the leadership of the party and formed an independent party entitled the Czechoslovak Social-Democratic Workers’ Party (Left).
It included most of the members of the former Social-Democratic Party.
The Congress condemned the splitting policy of the Right wing, expressed agreement with the conditions for affiliation to the Communist International, and instructed the new Executive Committee to conduct negotiations for joining the Communist International.
The reformist leaders took the course of splitting the party and in November 1920 held their own Congress.

Simultaneously with drawing up the electri-fication programme, work had also been started on its imple-mentation.
In particular, Krzhizhanovsky reported that in the Central Industrial Region fairly good progress was being made in the repair and socialisation of power stations (especially near Moscow).
It was necessary now, he wrote, “to link the operation of these stations with the electrification of local agriculture on a wide scale.
In this regard, too, I can inform you of something of immediate practical interest”.

In his note, Bukharin pointed out that whereas previously Bogdanov had re-cognised philosophy, he now abolished it and replaced it by “tek-tology” or “universally organised science” (as Bogdanov called his book published in 1913).
“This formulation of the problem is on a different plane from that of empirio-monism,” wrote Bu-kharin.
“It can be disputed but it is necessary at least to under-stand it.
Nevsky, however, does not have this minimum require-ment.

Bukharin was directed to speak at a meetingof the Communist group at the First All-Russia Congress of Pro-letcult, which was held in Moscow from October 5 to 12, 1920.
The document published here was Lenin’s reply to a note from Bukharin, who announced his refusal to speak at the Congress on the grounds that disagreements between him and Lenin were possible on certain questions of proletarian culture, for example, on point 4 of Lenin’s draft resolution “On Proletarian Culture” (see present edition, Vol.
31, pp.
316-17).
The Communist group at the First Congress of Proletcult was proposed to adopt an organ-isational resolution subordinating the central and local Proletcult organisations to the People’s Commissariat for Education.
This resolution was drawn up on the lines of Lenin’s express di-rectives and was unanimously adopted by the Proletcult Con-gress.

471In an effort to pit Turkey against Soviet Russia and to wreck ne-gotiations for establishing friendly relations, the Entente leaders instigated Dashnak Armenia to attack Turkey.
Dreaming of creat-ing a “Great Armenia” which would include almost half of Asia Minor, the Dashnak government began military operations against Turkey on September 24, 1920.
In this war the Dashnak army suffered defeat after defeat, while the advancing Turkish troops laid waste to the land, chased out the civilian population and organised massacres of Armenians.
The war brought Armenia to the brink of complete ruin and total extermination of the popu-lation.
At the beginning of October 1920, the C.
C.
, C.
P.
(B.
) of Armenia issued a call to the workers and peasants to overthrow the hated Dashnak yoke and establish Soviet power.
In connection with Orjonikidze’s report of the probable res-ignation of the Dashnak government of Armenia and of the possibility of power passing to the Communists, Chicherin proposed: 1) to agree with the opinion of the C.
