Notes 593 594 596 596 598 600 601 603 605 607 613 715PREFACE Volume 36 contains some of Lenin’s writings from 1900 to 1923.
A large part of the volume consists of his letters directly connected with the letters, telegrams and notes printed in volumes 34 and 35.
The letters for 1900-03 to P.
B.
Axelrod, G.
V.
Plekhanov, V.
P.
Nogin, S.
I.
Rad-chenko, P.
N.
Lepeshinsky and P.
A.
Krasikov, Yelena Stasova and others show Lenin’s varied activity in creating the first all-Russia illegal Marxist paper, Iskra, and the journal Zarya, and throw light on his struggle against “Legal Marxism” and Economism.
The letters for 1903-04 to G.
M.
Krzhizhanovsky, V.
A.
Noskov, V.
D.
Bonch-Bruyevich, G.
D.
Leiteisen and others relate to Lenin’s struggle against the disrupting and disorganising activities of the Mensheviks after the Second Congress of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Party.
The correspondence for 1905-07 sheds light on Lenin’s activity in connection with the calling of the Third Party Congress and the fulfilment of its decisions.
The documents for the years of reaction show the meas-ures taken by Lenin to resume publication of the newspaper Proletary in Geneva and improve the work of the Central Organ, and his struggle against open and undercover liquidationism and the attempts to distort the theoretical foundations of the revolutionary Marxist party.
A number of documents reflect Lenin’s activity in the International Socialist Bureau.
A large number of letters during the years of the First World War addressed to V.
A.
Karpinsky, A.
G.
Shlyap-nikov, Alexandra Kollontai and others deal with the resump-tion of publication of Sotsial-Demokrat (the Central Organ of the Party), the rallying of internationalist elements, and the exposure of social-chauvinism and Centrism in Russian and international Social-Democracy.
The question of call-ing the internationalists’ conferences at Zimmerwald and Kienthal is a prominent one in these letters.
A considerable part of the documents in the volume represent spadework done by Lenin—plans, summaries, out-lines, theses.
Among them are the “Preliminary Draft of the April Theses”, “Plan for a Report on the Seventh (April) All-Russia Conference of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
(B.
)”, “Draft Decree on Consumers’ Communes.
Preliminary Theses”, “Material for the Fourth (Extraordinary) All-Russia Congress of Soviets”, “Notes on the Question of Reorganising State Control”, “ On Polytechnical Education.
Notes on Theses by Nadezhda Konstantinovna * ”, “Notes for a Speech at the Tenth Congress of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on the Substitution of Food Requisitioning by a Tax”, “Notes for a Report at the Second All-Russia Congress of Political Education Work-ers”, “Notes on the History of the R.
C.
P.
”, “Notes for a Speech on March 27, 1922”, “Notes for a Report ‘Five Years of the Russian Revolution and the Prospects of the World Revolution’ ”, and “Outline of Speech at the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets”.
The volume includes 59 works (marked with an asterisk in the contents) which were first published in the Collec-ted Works in the Fourth Russian Edition.
Three letters to G.
V.
Plekhanov—November 9, 1900, July 13, 1901 and December 1, 1902—relate to the period when Plekhanov was a member of Iskra’s editorial board.
They draw atten-tion to the need to repel the efforts of some members of the board to weaken Iskra’s fight against opportunism and revisionism, and give details on the preparation of material for the various issues of the paper.
In a letter to Karl H.
Branting on April 19, 1901, Lenin invites the Swedish and Finnish Social-Democrats to estab-lish closer relations through contributions to the newspaper Iskra and the journal Zarya.
Lenin points out how impor-tant it would be for the Russian people, the Russian workers * N.
K.
Krupskaya.
—Ed.
in particular, to be informed about the political state of the people of Finland and their struggle against tsarism.
The volume includes the “Preface to the Speeches of Nizhni-Novgorod-Workers in Court”, written before December 1 (14), 1902.
In his letters to the secretary of the British Labour Representation Committee, dated March 23 and May 20, 1905, Lenin gives an account of the disburse-ment of the money sent in aid of the families who had suffered of “Bloody Sunday” (January 9, [22], 1905).
In a letter to Lydia Fotieva on June 1 or 2, 1905, Lenin tells of his intention to give a lecture in Paris on “The Third Congress and Its Decisions”.
The article, “The State of Affairs in the Party”, written in July 1911 during the preparations for the Party Conference at Prague, deals with the struggle against the conciliators and their Men-shevik and Trotskyite allies, who were trying to prevent the calling of the Conference.
Eight letters addressed to the editorial board of the Bol-shevik paper Pravda (five in October and November 1912, and three between February and April 1914) show Lenin’s guidance of Pravda, which brought up a whole generation of revolutionary Russian workers known as “Pravdists”-the letters deal at length with the work of the editorial board in connection with the Fourth Duma election campaign.
The volume includes nine articles written for Pravda in 1912 and 1913 but not printed at the time, and 16 articles published in Pravda in 1913 and 1914, part of them un-signed, part over various pen-names, and which were only established as belonging to Lenin on the strength of fresh archive documents.
His articles “After the Elections in America”, “More Zeal than Sense” and “In America” expose the deception of the masses by the bourgeois parties, and the cynical and dirty trading in “party principles” during the elections to secure the fat jobs in the Administration.
Lenin showed how the American multimillionaires, under the pretext of providing external defence for the state, were in reality defending the interests of the capitalist monopolies; he explained that the workers of all countries stood for peace, and that imperialist wars waged in the interests of the capitalists involved tremendous sacrifices.
In a number of articles, Lenin analyses the working-class movement in Germany.
The proletariat’s growing indignation against the imperialists and the plunder of the masses by a handful of capitalist arms manufacturers is described in “The German Social-Democrats and Arma-ments”.
In “Lessons of the Belgian Strike”, he examines the general strike by the Belgian proletariat in April 1913 to back up their demand for universal suffrage.
“The High Cost of Living and the ‘Hard’ Life of the Capitalists” and “Capitalism and Female Labour” deal with the plight of the workers in tsarist Russia and give a vivid description of the enrichment of a handful of capitalists and the im-poverishment and ruin of the masses of working people in capitalist conditions.
Included for the first time in the Fourth Russian Edi-tion of the Collected Works are the plan for a lecture on “The Russian Revolution, Its Significance and Its Tasks”, delivered at Zurich not later than March 27, 1917; a letter to Giacinto M.
Serrati of December 4, 1918; “Draft Third Clause of the General Political Section of the Programme (for the Programme Commission of the Eighth Party Congress)”, showing the essence of proletarian socialist democracy and its basic distinction from bourgeois democracy; a telegram to Bela Kun of May 13, 1919, with greetings for the Red Army of the Hungarian workers and peasants, and a letter to Bela Kun of June 18, 1919, warning him not to trust the Entente, * which was only trying to gain time to crush the revolution.
A group of documents (December 31, 1920-August 5, 1921) deal with the manufacture of electric ploughs.
In a letter to the chairman of the State Bank, A.
L.
Shein-man, on February 28, 1922, Lenin points to the defects in the work of the State Bank and the need for a more careful selection of personnel.
In a letter to N.
Osinsky on April 12, 1922, Lenin underlines the importance of studying and broadly popularising advanced local experience.
The volume includes documents dictated by Lenin in December 1922-January 1923: “Letter to the Congress”, known as the “Testament”, and letters “Granting Legis-* See Note 260.
—Ed.
lative Functions to the State Planning Commission” and “The Question of Nationalities or ‘Autonomisation’”.
These works lead up to Lenin’s last writings, which are of programme significance: “Pages from a Diary”, “On Co-operation”, “Our Revolution (Apropos of N.
Sukhanov’s Notes)”, “How We Should Reorganise the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Recommendation for the Twelfth Party Congress)” and “Better Fewer, But Better” dictated in January and February 1923 and published at the time in Pravda (see present edition, Vol.
33).
In his “Letter to the Congress” Lenin emphasises the need to preserve the Communist Party’s unity, and pro-poses practical steps to ensure it, enhance the Central Com-mittee’s prestige and improve the Party machinery.
Lenin proposes that the number of members of the Party’s C.
C.
should be increased to between 50 and 100.
He describes the personality of some Central Committee members, and points out Stalin’s defects and suggests a discussion of the question of replacing him by another comrade as Secretary-General.
In his letter “Granting Legislative Functions to the State Planning Commission” Lenin points out the need to extend its terms of reference and tells of the political and business qualities its leaders should possess.
Of great importance is Lenin’s letter, “The Question of Nationalities or ‘Autonomisation’”, written before and during the First Congress of Soviets of the U.
S.
S.
R.
It vividly brings out Lenin’s role as the true inspirer and creator of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and his concern for a correct national policy and the strengthening of the U.
S.
S.
R.
He demands the application of the prin-ciples of proletarian internationalism and the strengthen-ing of the friendship of all the peoples of the Soviet Union, great and small.
He condemns the Great-Power deviation in the national question as the principal danger at the time, points out the harmfulness of Great-Power and chauvinist distortion of the idea of unifying the Soviet republics, and denounces the excessive centralism and bureaucratic practices in this sphere.
He stresses the need to ensure full and effective equality of nations, to exercise skill in conducting thenational policy and take account of the particular features and interests of the various nations, and to strengthen the sovereignty of each republic as a necessary condition for the people’s unity and fraternal friendship.

The pluses of the article.
[Remarks about the mass and Social-Democratic mass movement—the impossibility for Social-Democrats to renounce their strict Social-Demo-cratic principles even for a moment—about propaganda and agitation, and the relationship between political rights and political freedom.
About not narrowing down the signific-ance of May Day, etc.
] 3.
The minus.
Some minor alterations in the article are desirable, and we suggest what they might be, hoping that joint discussions of them will bring us to complete agree-ment.
Firstly, there is need for a summing-up of what has been said, a résumé, a conclusion, as you yourself have already pointed out.
Secondly, in connection with this, a rewording of some passages and a shortening of the rest of the article (whose total length must not exceed 1 printed sheet) are desirable (for example, the following passages might be cut down: p.
3 [N.
B.
2]; p.
39 [N.
B.
16] and some others).
It seems to us that the rewording should consist in the fol-lowing: the whole form of the article has become something of a challenge (“open letter”, the official form of address, etc.
), and this is hardly desirable.
You yourself pointed out some of the extremes in the present polemics (“Mr.
G.
’s stalwarts”, 2 and similar things) and you were quite right; but since these extremes were there, we should now be more careful—not in the sense of conceding one iota of principle, but in the sense of refraining from needlessly embittering those who are working for Social-Democracy within the limits of their understanding.
Perhaps acriticism of the Rabocheye Dyelo programme in the third person would be better in this respect? For the same reasons it would be appropriate to make some “allowance” for the formal side of the Rabocheye Dyelo programme.
After all, it is not the programme of a party, nor even the draft programme of a party, so that it is incorrect to compare it with the programmes of the French and German Social-Democrats (at any rate, when such a com-parison is made without reservations, as it is on your p.
42 [N.
B.
17]).
The criticism of the formal side of the programme could be abbreviated (you yourself expressed the desire, on p.
2, to “leave aside” the formal defects), reducing the formal shortcomings, as particular cases, to the general defect of the programme in principle.
We think that such an alteration is desirable with respect to the critical re-marks on pp.
45 (N.
B.
20), 39 (N.
B.
16), 20 (N.
B.
9) and 6 (N.
B.
6).
The brusque formulation of these remarks here and there might give the people occasion to speak (and not entire-ly without foundation) of faultfinding.
The superfluous (from the strictly theoretical standpoint) reminder of the need to reckon with local conditions, etc.
, could be the result, not of the editorial board having failed to master scientific socialism, but of its wishing to emphasise this quite obvious point just at this moment, when it saw the need to do so.
And is there not sometimes a need to stress even self-evident things? We do not deny at all that, in the present case, 7 5 per cent—only 75 per cent—of the “need” boiled down to the “need” of bowing and scraping before Rabochaya Mysl.
If we forget about the remaining 25 per cent, we shall give the people a chance to accuse us of fault-finding, whereas if we reduce these formal defects, as partic-ular instances, to the general defect of principle, we shall take the faultfinding edge off our remarks and reinforce our line of argument.
Now a few more detailed remarks: P.
17 (N.
B.
8), footnote 1.
The remark “What does this dream augur?” is obscure.
P.
24 (N.
B.
11).
You cannot say that Social-Democracy “is little concerned about whether its demands are attain-able”.
We understand your idea and accept it, but it should be expressed with greater care and precision; “cannot makethe immediate possibility of attainment the supreme test” would indicate the road that needs to be taken, not the possibility of early practical success, or something of that sort.
P.
32 (N.
B.
13)—“to use its own expression”: isn’t that too strong? P.
33 (N.
B.
14)—“to seize, etc.
”: an awkward, incau-tious expression, because of the word “seize”.
P.
35 (footnote in fine * ).
(N.
B.
15.
) “Gendarmes” and so forth.
Would it not be better to strike out or change this? P.
43 (N.
B.
18).
Too strong.
“Peasantry” is a term we cannot eschew.
P.
44 (N.
B.
19).
Too strong and blunt.
The question of what the peasantry can provide is still far from settled by the Russian Social-Democrats (compare the footnote to the 1885 Programme of the Emancipation of Labour group 3 ), and is hardly likely to be decided in the sense that the political role of the peasants is equal to zero (cf.
Der 18.
Brumaire 4).
I hope to have a letter from you in reply to this, and not a letter alone, but the article as well (preferably not later than in 2 weeks’ time, 3 weeks at the outside).
G.

24 (about the possibility of attainment).

If you consider the passing on of my words to G.

If you do not find it unpleasant, please pass on my words on some suitable occasion, in a conversation, not as a complaint but as a correction.
At all events, please bear in mind that I do not insist.
We are not displaying the “revolutionary Sotsial-Demokrat organisation ” 7 signboard: when we wrote to you we emphasised that we were an independent literary under-taking.
8 Whether we shall have an “impossible” polemic is a question we dealt with in our previous letter.
We have no intention whatever of forgoing personal acquaintance with this or that ally, but see no useful pur-pose in having special relations between the Literary Group 9 and the Union 10 at the present time, because the Union’s distrust of us can be dissipated, I repeat, only by our publications, and any preliminary conversations would be futile.
There has not been, and cannot be any question of “con-sidering the Literary Group’s attitude to the Union binding upon you”.
If your refusal to participate is quite out of the question we are very glad not to have understood you quite cor-rectly, and hasten to send you an address to which all ma-terial from Russia could be sent (the Rögner address given you can be used only from abroad, and please don’t pass it on to anyone else).
Please inform us what you might con-tribute to the journal and the newspaper, whether or not you have anything ready and, if not, when you think you could write.

B.
, I have received your letter with the enclosures.
Thanks for these.
About the English journal (there were two messages in it) my sister 11 says that she doesn’t remember the title exactly —something like Family Pictures 12 —a yellow cover with red drawings, an illustrated journal, somewhat larger than Neue Zeit, 13 about 10 sheets; she says she gave it to you, in the presence of your wife, to pass on to me.
Alexei is well, writing, busy organising contacts.
He will be free in six or eight weeks, hardly earlier.
My brother 14 is still here, keeps putting it off.
The statement will be ready in a few days, and I shall of course send it on to you.
1 5 There is already plenty of copy for the paper; only a pity that it’s mostly highly specific workers’ stuff, strikes and strikes, and descriptions of the workers’ condition.
Nothing at all on internal ques-tions.
Dietz has undertaken to publish the journal for us.
The type has been bought, but there is still no responsible editor 1 6 : one arrangement has fallen through, but there are others in view.
If we fail to find a responsible editor, we shall move the printing press elsewhere.
How is your health? Do you manage to do any work? I suppose Paris has completely worn you out? Let us know about the article on Liebknecht 1 7 for the journal and for the paper—how do matters stand, and when can we expect to have it?I shake you warmly by the hand, and wish you the best of health and more free time.

We have just had a letter from Nakhamkis, from which it appears that there has been a misunderstanding about the subject of the Paris congresses.
18 You asked Gurevich to write, and of course this was very good.
Koltsov wrote to tell us that he intended to deal with the same subject, and even informed Nakhamkis that we had “commissioned” him to write about it, which was not actually the case.
Would you write to Koltsov suggesting that he should rather take up some other subject? Will you do this, please, since we don’t know exactly where he is at present.
We are writing to tell Nakhamkis that he and Gurevich should divide this work between them.

AXELROD October 18, 1900 Dear P.
B.
, I received your long and kind letter of Oct.
15 yesterday.
Many thanks for it.
We were very glad to learn that you are better, and that you can get on with your work.
Your article for the paper is being copied already! You are outstripping us: we are still unable to get organised to have someone copy out all the things that have to be sent off.
Zagorskaya 19 has still not arrived, while the stuff to be copied keeps piling up.
Sometimes I feel quite exhausted and out of touch with my real work.
I did not quite understand your hint about the impend-ing “trouble” with the Parisians.
20 Of course it would be terribly difficult for you to write about everything; but perhaps you will pass on the substance of it to Vera Iva-novna, who, we hope, will soon be coming here? We still have no responsible editor.
.
.
.
The statement has been prepared and sent to Russia (I will soon send you a copy), and before long it will be possible to begin setting up the paper.
We intend to publish a long report, “May Day Demonstrations in Kharkov” (about 50,000 letters and spaces), as a separate pamphlet, 21 and to print only a very brief extract in the newspaper; after all, we cannot take up three-quarters of a sheet with a single article! (The news-paper will have 3 columns a page, approximately 6,000 letters each, or, to be more precise, “letters and spaces”.
) (We intend the first issue to have 2 sheets, 8 pages.
) What do you think? Thanks for the advice on correspondents’ reports.
We shall certainly try to make use of it, because that would, of course, only improve the make-up of the paper.
22I quite agree with your view of my brother’s journey.
What can one do with him? We are constantly receiving warnings from every side—both from Paris (that people arriving from Russia mention us all three by name), and from Russia (that I was traced on my way here, 23 and that in one provincial town they arrested a perfectly innocent man, a distant relative, who had never seen one in his life, and asked him what instructions I had given him!)—and I am doing my utmost to persuade my brother either not to go, or to go for a fortnight all told; I keep arguing with him, ridiculing him, abusing him (I have never abused him so violently)—but nothing seems to have any effect: he keeps saying he wants to go home! And now he has brought matters to the point of the statement being sent to Russia, which means (if the statement arrives, and that is certain) a direct indication of the new literary undertaking.
After all, there’s not much longer to wait before Alexei arrives, surely? My “opponent” is about to arrive, and I will give him this to read—let him “refute” it, if he can do so with-out a twinge of conscience! We are both quite well, but very edgy: the main thing is this agonising uncertainty 24 ; these German rascals keep putting us off daily with “tomorrows”.
What I could do to them! Yes, I quite forgot (please be so kind as to forgive the hasty tone of this letter!)—we have already had negotia-tions with Buchholtz but he refused, refused flatly.
He is pressing upon us a Vermittlerrolle, * and won’t budge! My very best wishes, and greetings to all your family.
Yours, Petrov Zagorskaya has just arrived.
I will be seeing her tomor-row.

Please send us the article (on Liebknecht) as soon as it is copied out.
From what Zagorskaya said I could not get an idea of the exact size of the article, but size is, after all, not the main consideration: we can always make room, and it will always be a pleasure to do so, for your article.
As regards the lady from Paris who is going to South Russia in a month’s time, and wants recommendations.
I think the best thing to do is to introduce her to my sister, who is now in Paris and will be staying there another three weeks, if not more.
If you agree with this plan, let us know this lady’s name and address, and also write some little note to present to her on your behalf (if that should be necessary).
Send it either to me, or to my sister (103 Rue de la Glacière.

I hear that you have sent a cushion and an English jour-nal over here.

NOGIN November 2, 1900 Please forgive me, dear Novosyolov, that I am so dis-gracefully late with my reply to your letter of October 17.
I was constantly distracted by “petty” matters and chores here, and was also waiting for a reply from Alexei.
It was essential to wait for a reply, in order to clear up the question of our editorial statement.
Alexei has decided not to circulate it at present.
Therefore, in sending you a copy, I beg you to keep it secret for the time being, and not to show it to anyone (apart perhaps from that close friend of yours who has authority from the St.
Petersburg group, and about whom you write 26 ) and, in any case, not let it pass into anyone else’s hands.
In general, we have decided not to circulate this thing abroad until it has been distributed in Russia, and since Alexei is holding it back over there, it is particularly important for us to see that it does not spread out here.
Counting on your close participation in our undertaking, I decided to make an exception and to acquaint you with the statement.
When reading it please bear in mind that the intention is to pub-lish both a paper and a journal (or a miscellany); but the statement says nothing about the latter for certain special reasons connected with the plan for publishing the jour-nal.
27 Therefore, some passages of the statement should be read as applying not only to the paper.
Please write and tell me what impression the statement has made on you and your friend.
What type of “agitation journal” do the members of the Rabocheye Znamya group propose to publish (it was about them you wrote, wasn’t it?)? What kind of journal is it to be, and who is to work on it?As regards shipment across the frontier into Russia, I think this will always be easily done: we have connections with several groups who carry on such transport, and in addition a member of our group was recently given a promise (a solid one, judging by everything) that they would be able to take anyone across the frontier into Russia without a passport.
This, I think, is easily arranged.
The Russian passport business is much worse.
So far there is nothing, and the “prospects” are still very in-definite.
Perhaps this too will be arranged by the spring.
I shall probably be staying on here for a fairly long time, and our correspondence can therefore continue without in-convenience.
You ask what work we should like to request you to take on.
I think that (by the spring or by the autumn, whenever you intend to move) the following work will be of especial importance for us: (1) transport of literature across the frontier; (2) delivery throughout Russia; (3) organisation of workers’ groups to circulate the paper and collect in-formation, etc.
, i.
e.
, in general, organisation of the circu-lation of the paper and of close and proper connections between it and individual committees and groups.
We pin great hopes on your co-operation, particularly in the business of direct contacts with the workers in various places.
Does such work appeal to you? Have you anything against travelling? It would probably require constant travels.
Is the St.
Petersburg group, from which your friend has authority, still in existence? If so, could he provide addresses for contacts in St.
Petersburg and a password, in order to transmit our statement to them? Have they any connections with the workers in general, and the St.
Petersburg Workers’ Organisation in particular 28 ? All the best, and I wish you the speediest and easiest emergence from quarantine abroad.

B.
, and have today already sent off the note to my sister.
I have not passed on the letter to V.
I.
Before I forget: please, let me know to whom the cushion and the English book you sent here were addressed.
I have not yet received them.
If you sent them postlagernd, was it the ordinary postlagernd or Bahnhofpostlagernd, * or some other way? V.
I.
could not tell me, and I have been waiting for your letter all this time, but there is no men-tion of this in it.
Since I don’t know the name in the ad-dress, I cannot make inquiries.
Please, ask Vera Pavlovna to drop me a line about this, and kindly forgive me for worrying you again and again with these trifles.
As regards the article on Liebknecht, truly we don’t know what to do.
Your article turned out to be long enough for the journal: 8 pages (according to V.
I.
, similar to those in Nakanune 29 in small type, i.
e.
, about 8,000 letters per page)—this makes 64,000 letters, and even if we take Na-kanune’s larger type, it will come to about 50,000 letters! Our paper will have the Vorwärts format, also in three columns.
Each column of about 6,000 letters, which means that half your article will take up an entire page of the newspaper, plus another column! This is extremely incon-venient for the paper, apart from the inconvenience of dividing up such an article as yours about Liebknecht.
I will calculate all this more precisely when your ar-ticle arrives.
We shall do our best to carry it, but if this proves to be impossible because of the size, will you be * Railway poste restante.
—Ed.
so good as to allow us to publish it as a pamphlet supple-ment to the paper (if you are writing about Liebknecht separately for the journal)? We are now setting up the May Day Demonstrations in Kharkov pamphlet (50,000 letters); then will come the turn of the paper, and then of your pam-phlet about Liebknecht; if it proves necessary, an obituary could be written for the paper, with a reference to the pam-phlet.
What do you think of that? I repeat that all this is mere supposition; it is essential to make an exact calculation, and when I do this, on re-ceipt of your article, I will write to you at once.
I wish you all the best, and particularly that you should get well again as soon as possible.

AXELROD November 8 Dear P.
B.
, I have received your letter of the 5th and the article.
30 Many thanks.
The alterations probably involved a great deal of work and must have caused even more annoyance, because condensing such a subject must be extremely unin-teresting work.
It is all the more valuable to us that you undertook to do it.
Please excuse us for not sending you the articles: our “secretary” is, unfortunately, burdened with serious family duties, and therefore the copying pro-ceeds very slowly.
I enclose an article, “New Friends of the Russian Proletariat”, which we want to publish in No.
1 as a feature.
31 Please let us know your opinion (you can pencil it on the article) and then be kind enough to send it onto G.
V.
As regards the Parisians, we decided on the very tactics you advised: on the one hand, “not to arm”, and on the other, “to abstain”.
Of course, they are dissatisfied with our abstention and we were recently obliged (of necessity) to give such a rebuff to their expression of dissatisfaction that we feared a “cooling-off” (feared is not quite the right word, because we decided to give this rebuff even if it should inevitably lead to a rupture).
Yesterday, we received a reply from the “secretary” of the group they have formed in Paris 32 ; judging by the reply, our rebuff has had no harmful consequences, and “all is well”.
Let’s hope that this will continue to be so in the future.
It is quite true that later on we shall probably have to think of the “rules” and the other pleasant and interesting things you mention:but it was a master-stroke on your part to have set approx-imately six months for this.
It would be premature so long as the undertaking is not “in full working order”; we are completely in agreement with you in this respect.
But I cannot agree with you about beginning to appear here openly.
I cannot as yet think that “legality has al-ready been lost”.
To my mind, it has not yet been lost, and this “yet” may last another few months, during which time much will be clarified.
(My brother is already in Rus-sia, and so far all is well.
The traveller 33 is also wandering successfully, so far.
) And even if there were a complete and final loss of legality, there might be weighty consider-ations against coming out openly (for example, considera-tions about journeys home).
Therefore, until the first issues have appeared, and until all of us (including Alexei and my brother) get together, I shall, in any case, remain in hiding.
If the undertaking is destined to be a success, this decision may soon change, but my earlier “optimism” about this condition has been thoroughly shaken by “the humdrum of life”.
34 As regards the journal, it will soon be clear, I suppose, whether we shall organise it here or seek refuge in other countries.
As soon as this is cleared up, I shall let you know.
I find it very inconvenient to write to America, for after all I know no one there, and no one there knows me, and all the same it will be necessary to use you as an interme-diary.
Would it not, therefore, be better for you to write direct, and to send the statement, informing them that it comes from a Russian group, stating your attitude to this group and saying that a pamphlet, May Day Demonstra-tions in Kharkov, is now being set at the same printing press, and that when it is finished the paper will be set; that the statement says nothing about a journal (or a miscellany) for technical reasons of secrecy, but that for No.
1 there are being written (or are ready) such-and-such articles by G.
V.
, yourself and Kautsky (Erinnerungen * , an interest-ing piece which V.
I.
is already translating), and others.
It seems to me that all the aims you mention will be attained much better and much more directly by your letter, * Reminiscences.
—Ed.
while your dispatch of the statement to America no longer entails (I think) any undesirable publicity, particularly the sending of one copy for the secretary of the society there to read out at its meeting.

PLEKHANOV November 9 I received your letter today, dear Georgi Valentinovich, and at once sent you by registered book-post (1) the article “What Has Happened?” by Puttman; (2) the article by Byvaly, and (3) the article by D.
Koltsov about the Paris Congress.
36 Vera Ivanovna found this last article quite unaccept-able and I entirely agree with her.
The article is uninterest-ing, quite unsuitable for the journal (especially since you will be writing about Millerand 37 ) and much too long for the paper.
It contains 22,000-27,000 letters, whereas for the paper we need an item of 6,000-9,000 letters or only a little more.
We would therefore like to ask Rakovsky to write an article of that size for the paper, and to reject Koltsov’s article.
We decided to send it on to you, all the more since you were going to reply to Rakovsky.
So do as you find most appropriate—either reject Koltsov’s ar-ticle and order one from Rakovsky, or request Koltsov to rewrite and shorten the article, under your guidance.
It seems to us more probable that you will choose the first alternative, and in that case you can of course refer to us when informing Koltsov, and we can write to him our-selves as soon as we get your reply.
I am sending the article by Byvaly for polishing up and insertion of some corrections which you indicated.
Of course you may make corrections: please do so with all the articles, either making them in pencil right in the manu-script or on separate sheets.
I can, if you like, write to Byvaly afterwards about these corrections—he is not likelyto take a rigid stand, but if he does, we shall have to dis-cuss the matter and make a choice: whether or not to take the whole as it is.
The only thing I cannot agree with you on at all is the suggestion to cut out the mention of Ba-kharev’s pamphlet, 38 and this not so much because it would be extremely unpleasant for the author, as because I, too, consider Bakharev’s pamphlet useful (in spite of its de-fects), for it raises a really important point and, on the whole, deals with it correctly.
Byvaly writes not only about the old but also about the new; if serious revolutionaries had no need of such pamphlets in the 1870s, we nowadays cer-tainly have need of them, and we had the firm intention to print a critical but approving note about it (possibly in the paper, but not in No.
1).
The fact that quite young workers and intellectuals are being drawn into the mass movement, who have almost completely forgotten, or rather have no knowledge of what used to happen in the old days and how, and the absence of organisation of “expe-rienced” revolutionaries—all this makes it necessary to publish pamphlets about rules of behaviour for socialists.
The Poles have such a pamphlet, 39 which seems to give a great deal more than Bakharev’s does.
Vera Ivanovna agrees that the mention of Bakharev should not be cut out.
In certain conditions, if you think it useful, a discussion in the journal on the question of the possible importance of such pamphlets might perhaps not be altogether irrelevant.
We intend Byvaly’s article for the journal and not the paper.
Vera Ivanovna says that our paper turns out to be at a lower level, in terms of the readers for whom it is in-tended, than you probably imagine.
Vera Ivanovna is on the whole rather dissatisfied with the paper: she says it is of the Rabocheye Dyelo type, only somewhat more literary, more brushed up.
I have sent one article to Pavel Borisovich, asking him to send it on to you.
It would be quite inconvenient to have the question of Kautsky’s reso-lution shortened and abridged to the size of a newspaper article and that is why we should like the journal to carry an article or item on this question by you.
Or perhaps you intend to confine yourself to something very small? Prob-ably even an item on this subject will require about 10 printed pages, i.
e.
, about 20,000 letters, if not more?I must say that I thought you would be willing to write an item about Solovyov.
Puttman is hardly likely to take it on.
I shall write to him, but I am not very hopeful.
Vera Ivanovna is prepared to write about the Decembr-ists, 40 but what about the material? We shall write imme-diately to have them send us what they can.
Perhaps you too will suggest what it would be particularly important to have for this work.
I think the most important thing is the historical journals, which are not available here.
Gurevich is writing a big article for the journal on French affairs, and for the newspaper on the national congress.
Goldendakh or Nakhamkis was going to write about the International Congress, but did not.
Please send us your article, “Socialism and the Political Struggle “ (it can be sent by registered book-post to the same address of Lehmann); I doubt that Alexei would not like the article because of the comradely criticism, for I remember him telling me that he found the objections of Pavel Borisovich to be justified.
We shall number the separate sheets (unless they have been numbered already) and I don’t think the compositors will lose anything; after all, they always have to deal with separate sheets, and the same applies to our paper, and so far they have never lost anything.
The question of “res-ponsible editor” will evidently be settled favourably, I think, tomorrow or the day after (today I received news that two have agreed, and am expecting vital information tomorrow).
We think that all the same we shall not manage (initially, at least) without the help of Blumenfeld, whom Dietz has agreed to take on as a compositor, and who would put the thing on its feet for us, train the Germans, etc.
As soon as all this is finally cleared up, I shall write or telegraph to him at once.
But I should very much like to have your article, “Once More”, etc.
, 41 as soon as possible, because we might have to send it for setting immediately.
Against Rabochaya Mysl—more precisely, only against the article “Our Reality” in the Separate Supplement— I had an article, “The Retrograde Movement in Russian Social-Democracy”, 42 written as far back as a year ago.
It has now been sent here to me, and I am thinking of rewritingit for the journal, with additional material directed against Rabocheye Dyelo.
I don’t quite understand to which “latest No.
” of Rabo-chaya Mysl you refer.
No.

Is that what you have in mind? I would think the item, “To What Lengths They Have Gone”, 43 a useful one, though now I doubt the “belliger-ency” of Rabochaya Mysl: they nevertheless want to take a few steps “towards us” (passez moi le mot* ), and we ought to try to consider them verbesserungsfähig.
** But of course there should be an attack in any case: they won’t change unless attacked.
I have been corresponding lately with Vetrinskaya, an old comrade of mine in the League, 44 and told her that I supported Alexei’s words: “We shall have to wrestle with you.
” Go aheid, if you are not ashamed, she told Alexei.
I wrote to say that I was not in the least ashamed.
I should also like to have a talk with you about the eco-nomic trend and Alexei’s views, but it is already very late, and I will confine myself to a few words.
The eco-nomic trend, of course, was always a mistake, but then it is very young, while there has been overemphasis of “econ-omic” agitation (and there still is here and there) even without the trend, and it was the legitimate and inevitable companion of any step forward in the conditions of our movement which existed in Russia at the end of the 1880s or the beginning of the 1890s.
The situation then was so murderous that you cannot probably even imagine it, and one should not censure people who stumbled as they clam-bered up out of that situation.
For the purposes of this clam-bering out, some narrowness was essential and legitimate: was, I say, for with this tendency to blow it up into a theo-ry and tie it in with Bernsteinism, the whole thing of course changed radically.
But that the overemphasis of “ eco-nomic” agitation and catering to the “mass” movement * Excuse the expression.

AXELROD November 16 I have just received, dear P.
B.
, your remarks on the article “The Urgent Tasks”.
46 Many thanks.
What do you think about the unpopularity of this article? It won’t sound discordant, will it? I enclose the preface to the pamphlet May Day Demon-strations in Kharkov (some, but very small, corrections were made in the manuscript you have).
Please, let’s hear what you think of it, and do not hesitate to make your remarks on it, in ink or in pencil.
I am also sending you a document received from Russia about the amalgamation of the St.
Petersburg Workers’ Organisation and the League of Struggle.
47 They say the St.
Petersburg people are terribly proud of it, and Kiev is said to have adopted the programme already.
It must be written about.
Would you like to do so? (After reading this “document”—this “specimen”, as my brother calls it—please send it on to G.
V.
, if you don’t need it.
) We have at last found a responsible editor.
Ettinger has undertaken to sign two numbers in any case, giving up all claims about the “tone”, etc.
, and reserving the right after these two issues to make a statement in the press about her disagreement with the content, and so forth.
Let us hope that she will keep to this condition (she only asks very earnestly that we should say nothing about it to anyone until publication), and in the meantime we shall either find someone elge, or make other arrangements.
48 I per-sonally negotiated with Ettinger with the aid of Buch-holtz, who resigned from the Union for the purpose of takingsome steps in the spirit of conciliation.
I shall write in more detail about these steps later, considering that there is little of interest in them.
We now hope to begin setting in a few days.

Of course we shall try without fail to send you as many articles as possible, as this is vaIuable for the publications in all respects, quite apart from your natural interest in them.
One thing we are sorry about is that our secretary is überarbeitet * ; but this will change soon all the same, because serious reforms are afoot in the matter of Kinderpflege.
**49 Danevich has sent in an item of about 12,000 letters for the paper, on the French national congress; I hesitate to say whether it is entirely suitable.
Very possibly we shall manage without it if we have your chronicle of events, which we are awaiting impatiently.
Danevich is writing a big article on French affairs for the journal.
50 The enclosed letter is for Rolau: my colleague is writing to him about our “tea” business, because we think that my correspondent Skubiks is not in town.
51 Please be good enough to pass this letter on to Rolau, and ask him to reply to us at once (forgive me for troubling you with such a re-quest: I hope you can entrust, say, Gurevich with this).
But if Rolau is not in town, would you be so kind as to read the letter addressed to him, and have a talk about its matter, if only with Skubiks’s wife.
The thing is that * Overworked.

we must have a definite reply as soon as possible, and if neither Rolau nor Skubiks is available, this can’t be done otherwise than by a personal talk between you and someone of their company.

53 Tomorrow, November 27, he begins the setting, and consequently we may hope that in two weeks’ time (or a little more) everything will be quite ready.

AXELROD December 11 Dear P.
B.
, Thank you very much for letting us have your remarks so speedily on the item about the split.
56 I have made the corrections you want, except that I could not cut out al-together the mention of the Rabocheye Dyelo’s services: it seems to me that this would be unfair to an opponent with a record not only of offences against Social-Democracy.
Poletayev told me a piece of news that has made me very glad, that you have to some extent got free of the yoghurt, and could pay us a short visit.
Now this would be splendid! I think there will be no difficulty in finding accommodation, one can take a room by the week.
After all you do have a Swiss citizen’s passport.
I am still waiting (still, because I have been waiting a long time already, and to no purpose) the early arrival of both friends.
Alexei writes that he is “eager to come”, but is being somewhat delayed by various circumstances.
The other friend has not written for a long time, but I don’t think this means that anything very bad has happened.
By the time they arrive, both Iskra (in 1 or 2 weeks) and Zarya will probably have appeared (Dietz has hired another compositor and is driving ahead quickly, hurrying us up.
By the way, will you have anythiog for this issue of the journal * ?).
By that time, something will also have been cleared up about the transport (what a difficult problem!) and about the * Perhaps you could put together something of what you wrote about Liebknecht and which did not go into the paper.
material, and then it would be extremely desirable to have a general meeting.
I look forward to this very much.
What about young Adler’s article 57 ? Is he writing it? When will it be ready? Please hurry him up in a letter and —if you find the correspondence too burdensome, or if the Umweg * via Munich—Zurich—Vienna entails long delay, then give him Lehmann’s address (Herrn Dr.
Med.
Carl Lehmann, Gabelsbergerstrasse 0a.
München.
On the second envelope: für Meyer)—and give us his address, and we shall squeeze a reply out of him.
We want to print 1,000 copies of Zarya for Russia and 500 for abroad.
I am eagerly awaiting your chronicle, and then a meeting.
Yours, Petroff For Gurevich: Please try and arrange the following: we need to have a good address in Zurich through which Yefimov (Dietz’s compositor) could carry on correspondence with Geneva, i.

AXELROD Midnight, December 14, 1900 Dear P.
B.
, Forgive me for having disturbed you unnecessarily with my telegram.
Not having received the article in the morn-ing, I inferred (after your telegram of yesterday) that some-thing had happened, and decided to inquire by tele-gram, in particular under the influence of a desperate letter from the printers.
And then your article arrived a few hours later! I hasten to inform you without delay of its arrival, as you asked, and, once again, please excuse the telegram.
I am very, very glad that we shall soon see each other; my “brother” will, I think, also arrive in a few days, and Alexei too, possibly, in 2 or 3 weeks’ time.
There is still no article from Paris on the International Congress—I have sent a telegram today.
I may have to go away for a short time before the paper appears, in order to sort out various small items (we are bad-ly out in thousands of letters, and are now throwing out a good deal!), but this will take 3 or 4 days, no more.
Let me know whether I should take a room for you, or just have a preliminary look for one.
I will ask V.
I.
about your requirements, and will begin my search.

My brother arrives this evening.
Alexei will not get rid of his obstacles and leave before Dec.
20 (O.
S.
).
I was quite unable to send the proofs—I myself could not get them, and had to make the journey to sort things out on p.
8.
However unpleasant it was, I had to divide your article, and hold up the second half for the next issue, 59 otherwise what was essential could not have gone in, on account of the setting (for technical reasons) in bourgeois, instead of brevier.
And so, from Vasilyev—? And from Adler—nothing? You say nothing of Adler in your letter.
The journal is going forward: G.
V.
has sent in an article on Struve 60—6 articles have been sent in all.
All the best, and I heartily wish you speedy recovery from the influenza which is raging so everywhere this year.
Yours, Petroff P.

I have just learned from Gurevich’s letter that you have received the article on Austria.
That’s fine.
Haveyou a really good translator? If not, send us the article, we shall translate it over here.
To Gurevich Thanks for your information.
Of course it would be de-sirable to have details about the Riga comrade: what kind of work would and could he take on? How free and finan-cially well off is he, etc.
? Please tell Skubiks that I got his letter, but did not reply because I was away—and now can only say that our man is already “there” and has an address, so that the matter I was corresponding with Skubiks about is settled.

NOGIN January 3, 1901 Dear Comrade, I have received Revolution and Counter-Revolution, 61 and am very grateful to you for sending this booklet.
As regards transport we cannot at this moment undertake any definite obligations.
Our routes are just now being arranged and will evidently be arranged satisfactorily; but it remains to be seen how they will function.
In all probability we shall be able to give you quite a definite reply in 2 or 3 weeks at the outside, and will be happy to undertake the shipment of your booklet, if we can.
We know nothing of Max Menkus, and are not doing our business through him.
Your letters and reports have been received.
We have already used some of them for the paper.
Incidentally, the first issue should be ready in a few days, and I shall then send you a copy.
62 We expect our Poltava friend to arrive here in the very near future.
All the best.
Oh yes, there is also this.
Having learned that we have completed a translation of Kautsky’s book, Bernstein and the Social-Democratic Programme, a member of the Rabocheye Znamya group approached a mem-ber of our group in Russia offering to publish the transla-tion.
63 But we should like to publish it ourselves, in our own name.
Therefore would the persons who made the offer agree to give us the money for its publication, if onlysome of it? Please write to tell us whether you are able and willing to write to them about it.
Yours, Petrov * We propose to publish Hyndman’s article in the near future with a footnote that “it has been sent to us in the author’s MS.

TO V.
P.
NOGIN January 24, 1901 Dear Comrade, I have received your letter about the passports, have written to my friend here who might be expected to help me in this respect, and am now awaiting a reply.
I think it will be possible to get a foreign (Bulgarian or German) passport (for entering Russia), but I’m not hopeful about a Russian passport, or at least a blank passport, not filled in.
This may, of course, come off, but I should advise you to take steps right away to secure a foreign passport, at the risk of being left without any at all.
But as regards a Russian passport, if we succeed in getting one, it will be more likely in Russia.
If there is to be no mention of Rabocheye Znamya in the footnote, would you suggest another way of putting it? For example, from (through) a member of the Rabocheye Znamya group who worked in St.
Petersburg in 1897, or something like that.
I think it would be better to say some-how through whom the article was received, but if you think otherwise, naturally we shall publish it without any indication of how we received it.
I have been told the name of tbe St.
Petersburg man who made the proposal (in one of the provinces, and a fairly remote one) about publishing the translation of Kautsky.
I am afraid to entrust the name to the post; however, I will let you have it in this form.
Write down Alexei’s name, patronymic (in Russian style) and surname, and number all the 23 letters in their order.
Then the surname of this St.
Petersburg man will consist of the following letters: 6, 22, 11, 22 (for this substitute the next letter of the alphabet), 5, 10 and 13.
65As to the sale of Revolution and Counter-Revolution, we shall inquire from those organisations abrsad with whom we have contacts.
Over here everything now depends on transport, which is eating up a lot of money because this is a new undertaking.
I cannot therefore give you any definite reply as regards financial aid for fabricating passports, until it has become clear just how much money is needed for this, and what the chances are that all the other essentials (money apart) are available.
Alexei paid out money to one influential organ-isation as long ago as last spring (sic!) for the purchase of blank passports (which they had promised), but so far has had nothing.
Would you agree to take on yourself in the immediate future a permanent function in transportation—i.
e.
, to live near the frontier, travel around, communicate with the contrabandists, etc.
? Do you know German, or any lan-guage other than Russian? * Every good wish, Yours, Petrov I enclose the paper 66 ; please show it to no one except your friend, and let me know your opinion.

And also do you happen to know an absolutely reliable comrade who is a compositor?TO THE BORBA GROUP 67 February 3, 1901 Dear Comrades, We are deeply distressed over your letter of refusal to co-operate.
Our letter to Nevzorov (a letter with a special enclosure for you of the “statement,” the No.
1 of Iskra, and a proof of Ryazanov’s article) and your refusal letter must have crossed, having been sent off at the same time.
This alone will show you how far it was from us to keep you from taking part in our affairs.
We ask you to excuse the delay—that is indeed our fault, but you must bear in mind that we suffer as much as you do from the “indefinite state of relations”.
We have strictly abided by our group’s decision not to circulate the newspaper abroad before it is circulated in Russia, making an exception only for our closest associates, including your good selves.
Until quite recently, we had been altogether uncertain as to whether the paper would circulate in Russia (even today we cannot vouch for it); we had our hands full in this matter in connection with some fresh negotiations (with the liberal democrats—so far a big secret!), 68 and this delayed fulfilment of the decision adopted a fortnight or so ago to send you the issue of Iskra.
Our statement has not yet been circulated in Russia but has only been shown to several persons.
We repeat that what has happened is the result not of any lack of concern but of the indefiniteness and bustle from which we ourselves have not yet emerged.
We shouldbe very happy to see the misunderstandings produced by this cleared up and find you taking your old attitude to our common cause.
Comradely greetings, Petrov Sent from Munich to Paris First Published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIII Printed from the originalTO THE BORBA GROUP February 21, 1901 Dear Comrades, Your insistence on “defining relations” has surprised us but, to our deep regret, we cannot satisfy you in this respect.
Our business is just being started, the wheels have only just been set in motion, and whether it will really get going depends on everyone vigorously co-operating —when suddenly, instead of doing the urgent work, we are asked to set about “defining relations” with some kind of particular exactness! We think that close and constant collaboration (which has already been expressed by your sending us two articles, and on which we were relying for the future) is a sufficiently definite relation, and that from it there clearly follows also the right of contributors to speak on behalf of the publication, enlist supporters, estab-lish contacts, collect funds, order articles, etc.
That this enlistment will naturally lead also to more intimate con-tacts between those enlisted and the editorial board, and that the establishment of final agreements (about any undertaking, or about the management of this or that sec-tion, or this or that function) will require direct contacts between the editorial board and those who have been en-listed, all this likewise follows, as a matter of course, from the very nature of relations between close contributors and the editorial board.
We hope that our relations could in the course of time develop from the form of simple collaboration to the kind of co-operation under which some departments would be allocated, and general editorial conferences would be held from time to time.
Furthermore, we do not deny of course that the business of organising things abroad will require (in 3 or 6 months’ time) the creation of new forms, organs and functions, and were relying on you in this respect, but we are unable to set about all this immediately, when Zarya and Iskra have still to be consolidated.
We hope that you, too, will realise our position and will agree that any further “definition of relations” at the present time is impossible.
All the best.

He and I are setting out tomorrow: he is going on through Vienna, I am going via Vienna to Prague on my own business.
69 Please excuse me for writing briefly, because of appointments and packing.
A letter has come from Dietz to the effect that he is not printing the statement (about an alliance with the liber-als), that this is dangerous (“amalgamation”, groups, etc.
) and that, altogether, would it not be better for us to have a secret printing press?! We are very much astounded by this piece of news from the erratic idiot Dietz.
We have decided (provisorisch * ) for the time being to leave Zarya here (for the time being!) and print the rest in Geneva.
I think that diplomatic relations with the Parisians have been resumed.

BRANTING 76 April 19, 1901 Dear Comrade, Our comrade in Berlin has already written you on our behalf that we should like to establish closer contacts with the Swedish and Finnish comrades.
Allow me, at this time, to make the following request on behalf of the editorial board of the Russian Social-Democratic journal Zarya (J.
H.
W.
Dietz Verlag.
Stuttgart).
We attach very great importance to informing the Rus-sians in general, and the Russian workers in particular, of the political situation in Finland and the oppression of Finland, and also of the stubborn struggle waged by the Finns against despotism.
We should therefore be most grateful to you if you transmitted to all the Finnish com-rades you know our urgent request to support us in this undertaking.
It would of course be particularly helpful for us if we could find a permanent Finnish contributor who would send us, firstly, monthly notes (4,000-8,000 letters), and, secondly, longer articles and reviews from time to time.
We need the latter for Zarya and the former for the illegal Russian paper Iskra, whose editorial board has made this request of us.
If you think it useful, I will send you Zarya and two issues of Iskra.
The articles may be written also in Swedish or in Fin-nish; we shall find a translator ourselves.
I beg you to inform me whether you can comply with our request.

VECHESLOV For Yuriev April 25 I have received your letter.
Please send us as soon as you can an exact account of how many suitcases you have received and of what kind, how many have gone and how many remain.
We need this to draw up our report and financial accounts.
As regards the literature, I have also long been asking you to write how much you received, and what in particular, where you sent it and how it was used.
We have not got the May Day leaflet (N.
B.
).
The money (100 marks) has already been sent; I repeat my request that you make an extra effort to obtain money in Berlin and elsewhere for the suitcases; you will thereby be giving us the most serious and essential help.
How much money of your own have you in hand? What is the average (and actual) monthly turnover? It would be very important to send Kharkov Days as soon as possible to the South, where they are pressing for it.
I have not quite understood you about the bulletin.
(1) Is it the Iskra Promotion Group or the Neutral Group that wants to publish it? 82 (2) Are the bulletins to be the same as before or different? We think that it would be ex-tremely unwise to spend money on bulletins of the old type and, for our part, find it difficult to promise raw ma-terial, for the reason that we are working intensively at present on turning Iskra into a monthly paper, 83 and we have neither the time nor the money for copying and sendingout material.
What we have to think of is not dividing up the available material into bulletins, and weakening both its importance and impression by circulating it in a raw state abroad, but, on the contrary, concentrating all the ma-terial in Iskra and accelerating its publication with well-edited and illuminated material.
Any other tactics would mean not a struggle against, but a promotion of, the present ideological vacillation and confusion.
It is not surprising that such bulletins were published by the Neutral Group, with its absurd composition and programme, but we should expect more co-operation and rational work from the Iskra Promotion Group.
Try and pass on these views to your group (but do not read my letter in full, because I am writing to you personally) and per-suade it.
Let us know its decision.
Bulletins reviewing the foreign press on Russia are a different matter.
They are of course useful.
Send us cuttings from the Russian papers.
Would it also be possible to sup-ply the Iskra editorial board with Russian journals, after they have been read in Berlin? If it would, let us know what journals we could count on (we have some, but not enough).

RADCHENKO We have received your letter.
We fully approve of your method of distributing the literature, and advise you to keep strictly to it, without listening to anyone’s advice or calumny.
One thing that is desirable is that you should show some consideration for the Sotsialist group, 84 and, in case of need, give them some privileges (for example, credit), because they are seeking to come closer to us, and promise to agitate for us.
They have offered us a share of their income instead of payment for literature; we authorise you to accept this, at your discretion, if you find it not unprofitable financially.
(Why do the Sotsialist group complain that you don’t give them any literature?) In general, don’t give away anything free, but distribute everything as quickly as possible for cash.
Don’t give any money to Grigoryev, send it all to us.
Grigoryev should make money on his own literature, of which he has a lot.
Number 3 is being printed, and the fourth is to follow immediately.
A May Day leaflet and a special Iskra leaflet have appeared.
85 Do everything you can to have people sent to Berlin to collect the suitcases (the address is).

If you still have some 100-200 of Kharkov Days, send them immediately by hand to.

KRASIKOV 2a 3b—r—— 86 June 1, 1901 We should be very glad to work together with —r——.
He would be particularly useful at this time of wobbling among the public in general, and of all kinds of intrigues abroad in particular.
Unfortunately, our financial posi-tion is very bad, and we are absolutely unable to allocate any money for his journey and his living expenses.
It is also extremely difficult to find paid employment here (we say nothing of France and French Switzerland, because we don’t know them.
—r—— himself is better informed about this than we are).
Only in one case could we give some financial support: if —r—— were to undertake to go abroad, get a French passport here and use it to cross the frontier two or three times in various places, taking across a couple of suitcases each time.
We have to pay for such transport anyway, and should of course pay him more willingly than some outsider.
With his knowledge of the language and his resourcefulness, he would certainly be able to do it, and might find someone else on the way for the same purpose.
If he is agreeable, let him write at once—you will read him the whole of this letter—and tell us his distinguishing features in as great detail as possible.
On the strength of these features we shall then immediately apply for a French passport, and on receipt of it will let him know, so that he can start out.
In general, our cause now hinges on transport, transport and transport.
Whoever wants to help us should entirely concentrate on this.
Now about the 125 rubles.
We have been repeatedly caught out over advances to other organisations: we have given away a pile of money, and the result has been insig-nificant, almost nil.
Therefore we are very much afraid of paying in advance.
Furthermore, it is more important for us to have swift delivery of a small quantity (if only half a pood a month) than of 10-20 poods over 3-4 months, because our first priority is Iskra’s monthly publication and delivery.
Up to now suitcases virtually alone have kept us going.
So have as detailed a discussion as possible to find out whether the offer is reliable, which organisation is mak-ing it, the type of transport, and whether we could have our own man in there for supervision and participation, and then let us know.
If they agree to have a trial run without payment in advance, take the decision yourselves.
But if we are to hand over a sizable sum immediately, we shall have to consider and discuss all the particulars very thoroughly.

VECHESLOV June 17, 1901 We have received your letter asking us to send you 100 marks.
Unfortunately, I cannot fulfil this request until I have received from you the “latest information” which you promised.
I simply cannot take it on myself to decide to pay out this sum (both for formal reasons, because it depends on the board, and for the reasons I explained to you when we met), and I cannot get the board together at present because some people are absent.
I ask you once again not to be sparing of reports to us of the latest and most detailed facts, otherwise our relations will never settle down to normal.
Information of the kind that “so far every-thing is satisfactory” may produce, if anything, a negative impression on our board, which decides such matters.
I understand very well that the most energetic efforts often prove fruitless for reasons beyond our control, and that it would be stupid to blame you for any failures.
But you, too, must understand that unless we have the most circum-stantial and exact information of what those efforts were, what exactly was successful (respective * unsuccessful), why precisely and what the state of affairs and the plans at the present moment are, we cannot take any further steps and impose on our principals further sacrifices, for which we bear the responsibility.

We think it is essential to keep a copy, as a document.
We are having No.

I should very, very much like you to look in here and have a talk about various things—but I am afraid of inviting you lest, instead of relating, you put more strain on your nerves.
If this does not frighten you, do come.
They have written to us from Russia that there is increas-ing talk of a congress.
This once again impels us to think of a programme.
The publication of a draft programme is extremely necessary, and would be of tremendous impor-tance.
94 But apart from you and G.
V.
there is no one to take it on: it’s a job that requires calm concentration and careful consideration.
Please come to our help, provided your affairs and your health permit.
Or perhaps you will see G.
V.
and spend some time with him—you could then take advantage of such a stay? Kautsky passed through here (on his way for a holiday in Tyrol), but we forgot to talk with him about the Erfurter Programm (which Alexei is now looking through).
Has he promised a special introduction? What were the books about which you told Alexei’s sister that they had been sent? We can’t be too sure about the foreign affairs review for Zarya: Parvus wants to write only about organisation, Luxemburg and Danevich will (perhaps) give us something on France, and nothing else, neither on Germany nor Aus-tria.
That’s bad! Well, until later.
Forgive me for writing so rarely; I have very little time left in the local hurly-burly.

PLEKHANOV July 13, 1901 I have received your letter of the 11th.

I disagree with this opinion, and I (personally) would like to know your view, both of this P.
S.
in particular, and of the opinion likewise that it could supposedly be rejected after the adoption of the whole article, owing to the “literary defects” in the P.
Scriptum.
The “rescue” of the P.
S.
, about which you write, may be possible if there is a resolute vote by Pavel Borisovich for, and even then not for certain: the votes will be equally divided, for Alexei, is now almost entirely against.
Generally speaking, I think that on any matter in any way relating to “controversial” points, you ought to make a direct inquiry about the reasons for the opinions ex-pressed by our Struvefreundliche 98 this could be done by letters addressed to Lehmann as before (altogether, letters should now be addressed through to Lehmann) with an addi-tion “für Meyer” and “for Puttman” I’m afraid I simply cannot undertake to give an account of their views.

I have just got on to him, and could probably find use for what bears on France and Belgium (Vandervelde et Destrée, Le socialisme en Belgique, * quoted by Chernov, and also Vandervelde’s latest work 100 ).

AXELROD July 21, 1901 Dear P.
B.
, I was intending to reply to your letter, but kept putting it off until I received the article.
Don’t be in any particular hurry with it, if it is hard work, or even give up reading it altogether, to give yourself a rest and have some proper treatment.
G.
V.
has already written to me in considerable detail where he sees changes desirable, and I shall of course try to make all these changes 101 (but as to changing the tone .
.
.
I really don’t know whether I can do that.
It is hard-ly likely that I can write in diplomatic tones about a gentle-man who arouses such violent feelings in me.
And I don’t think G.
V.
is quite right when he says that my “hatred” will be incomprehensible for the reader: I will quote the example of Parvus, who, without any knowledge of the author, after reading the introduction felt the same hostility to this “dolt”, as he called him—but that is in parenthesis).
I very much disapproved of our having im-posed two jobs on you (reading my article and Orthodox’s) just when you had gone away for treatment and a rest.
Try rather to make really good use of the period of your treat-ment, and do not by any means burden yourself with a close reading of the manuscripts.
Please, write (and send manuscripts and everything else) only to the following address: Herrn Dr.
Med.
Carl Lehmann.
Gabelsbergerstrasse 20 a/II.
München (inside: für Meyer).
The Rittmeyer address is no longer good (but if you havesent something to Rittmeyer before receiving this letter, we shall still get it).
Do you happen to have Liebknecht’s book Zur Grund-und Bodenfrage (Leipzig 1876)? Or perhaps one of the Zurich comrades has it? I need it very much for an article against Chernov, and it is not available at the library here, nor has Parvus or Lehmann got it.
Well, so long.
I wish you the very best, and hope you have a good rest and are thoroughly fit again.
Yours, Petrov P.
S.
Here’s another request: do you (or Greulich) hap-pen to have the minutes of the congresses of the International —or Vorbote 102 (which, I believe, carried the full reports)? This Chernov fellow keeps worrying me: I do believe the scoundrel has distorted things in referring to the minutes of the congresses of the International, and putting down as “dogmatic Marxism” even the “solidarised communi-ties” (of Rittinghausen).
103 If you could help me with this material, I should be very grateful.
[But if you have to go to a lot of trouble to find these references, don’t do it, please: I shall manage somehow.
] Here’s yet another request (I feel that I’m making a hog of myself—piling up request upon request—but it’s hard to stop once you’ve started.
But really, if you have to go to a lot of trouble, like travelling about in search of the books, etc.
, let it go, and “shelve” my applications.
I’ll manage somehow.
I shall make mincemeat of Chernov in any case).
The fact is that the swine Chernov quotes Engels’s article, “The German Peasant” (in Russkoye Bo-gatstvo, 1900, No.
1).
When I found the article I discovered that it was a translation of Engels’s article “Die Mark” (Anhang * to the pamphlet, Die Entwicklung des Sozialis-mus von der Utopie zur Wissenschaft) 104 (I’ve only got the 4th edition of the pamphlet, 1891), but at the end of the translated text there is an addition of two tirades in Russian which the original does not have and which contain highly dubious statements: “restore (sic!) the mark”, etc.
* Addendum.
—Ed.
I wonder what that is: a distortion by Russkoye Bogat-stvo? In which case they ought to be pilloried good and proper.
But first we must look at this from every side: a footnote to the Russian article says that Engels’s article “appeared in one of the German magazines in the 1880s, without his signature.
But the offprint which Engels sent to one of his friends was signed with his initials”.
(1) Have you any idea which “German magazine” it is? Could it be Neue Zeit? (2) Do you happen to have an early edition of the pamphlet Die Entwicklung des Sozialismus von der Utopie, etc.
, with the “Die Mark ” Anhang? It is necessary to make a collation to find out whether the early editions contained the tirades the 4th edition does not have (al-though this is very unlikely).
Then I need for the purposes of comparison the pam-phlet: W.
Wolff, Die schlesische Milliarde, 105 which I was unable to find at the local library and which is not avail-able at the Vorwärts Buchhandlung * either—it’s been sold out.

AXELROD August 24, 1901 Dear P.
B.
, I enclose Nevzorov’s article which he has rewritten.
It has confronted us with this dilemma: either to publish it in Zarya, or to reject it altogether.
The votes are divided equally (Alexei and Arsenyev, for; Velika Dmitrievna and I, against).
Please cast your vote.
I must say that I am par-ticularly exasperated by the fact that everyone (even Ar-senyev!) says the article is “vile”, “treacherous” (as G.
V.
has also called it), but they keep talking of printing it! To my mind, this is the worst tactics of indulgence and connivance.
They say in defence of the article: “It’s a contributor’s letter to the editorial board.
It’s awkward to reject it.
” In my opinion, once a contributor adopts that kind of attitude, we are in duty bound to put an end to it.
Let him go to Rabocheye Dyelo and Godspeed (Nevzorov even wrote to ask us if we had any objections to it!? Sic!)— that will help us to “document” his figure much better, and take him to pieces much more freely than in our Zarya.
(One of the arguments for was that it should be printed to provide the occasion for replying to the widespread ar-guments.
) And so, it’s up to you to decide the issue! And how about Finn’s article? If it’s a good one (as you wrote), shouldn’t we publish it in Zarya? Will you send it to us? How is your health? I heard that you were not far from Thun, but I hope the letter will be readdressed.
When do you expect to visit G.

AXELROD August 30, 1901 Dear P.
B.
, I received your letter today, and today also sent off the proofs of my article 107 to Dietz.
I have made the change you suggested—at the end, separating the liberals from the revolutionaries who had been designated together as “we”.
But as regards the “providential slip”, I could do nothing about it: alteration of this passage would have required much too extensive changes; besides, the spirit of the whole article makes it impossible to alter it in the sense of eli-minating the “one-sidedness” (you are right, of course, that the presentation is “one-sided”: how could one observe a judicious balance in a polemical article devoted to an at-tack on one of the flanks of our opponents! What I mean is that it’s not that I don’t see the defect here but that it lies too deep to be eliminated by one particular alteration).
We have been receiving all your letters.
As regards my sister, I don’t know how matters stand, because I haven’t heard from her for quite a long time.
You have, of course, received Alexei’s letter describing the obstacle to the congress 108 ? We shall wait and see how you and Danevich decide this matter.
The seventh issue 109 has appeared, and has of course been sent to you.
In the eighth, there will be Ryazanov’s article, “The Imperial Drink Shop” (on the vodka mono-poly); then we anticipate an article on the new law (of June 8) on land grants to nobles in Siberia.
110 In the social chron-icle, there are reports on the liberals’ congress, the dis-graceful treatment of exiles in Siberia, the deep unrest inout-of-the-way places like Kursk, and about the revolt of seminary and gymnasium students.
We also have a very interesting article by a worker—a reply to Dadonov, who abused the Ivanovo-Voznesensk workers in Russkoye Bo-gatstvo.
111 It’s a very good article, they say (I haven’t read it yet), so that we don’t know where it should be best printed, in Iskra or in Zarya.
In No.
8 of Iskra, there is a letter by Danevich from France.
We still have no foreign review for Zarya! Nor are we likely to have one on home affairs either.
112 It’s a misfor-tune! Meanwhile, Zarya is getting fatter and fatter.
We already have 6 sheets& 4 (Plekhanov’s “Critique”)& 2 (him again, against Bernstein)& 2 (Nevzorov& Alexei)& 2 or 3 (Velika Dmitrievna and Starover).

GUREVICH November 3, 1901 Dear Comrade, You told us, in our talk here before the departure, that however our relations developed—and even if we went our several ways—you would in any case remain a contri-butor to our publications.
After that we repeated to each other, even after the sad outcome of our negotiations on organisation, 113 that we did not in any way “declare war on each other”, and remained political allies albeit temporarily treading our different ways.
We hope, therefore, that you will continue to send your letters from France to Iskra.
To our regret, we have not been able to get a definite reply to this question from the member of your group here.
Please, let us know whether or not you intend to co-operate with us in the future.
You know, of course, how much we value your literary co-operation, and if today, after the formation of the League, the organisational relations between ourselves and your group have become more complicated, there are no obstacles to closer literary collaboration on our part, in any case.
We should welcome it.
With comradely greetings.

.

P.
S.
From what Ryazanov said I have drawn the con-clusion that my words about the possible effect of our dif-ferences on the literary agreement were misunderstood.
All I had in mind was the pamphlets agreement (the League has set up a special board of pamphlet editors); but thefoundation of the League has not affected the purely literary relations between the editorial board of Zarya and Iskra and their contributors.

KrupskayaTO LYUBOV AXELROD November 27, 1901 Dear L.
I.
, Thank you for your book which V.
Iv.
has shown me.
I very much regret that I have not yet been able to start reading it: first, I have lately been very busy with a pamph-let (against Rabocheye Dyelo), 114 and, secondly, I am once again going down with some “undetermined” illness.
The work is at a standstill, and I don’t know how soon I shall be able to get down to it again! And it’s urgent work.
As regards a recommendation to Popova, to my deep regret I am quite unsuitable for this.
I don’t know and never have known Popova personally.
I dealt with her only through Struve (and, you will understand, it’s quite out of the question to ask him to recommend your book.
Yet he is editorial manager of Popova’s publications!).
If I were to apply to Popova, therefore, the result would be sooner negative than otherwise.
But even that is not all.
I recently wrote (a month or six weeks ago) to Popova for the first time, asking her to send me a copy of the second volume of the Webbs, the translation of which I edited and which has only just been published.
115 Up to this day I have neither reply nor book! I once had what you might call a “friendly ” correspond-ence with Vodovozova.
But she has not replied at all to my last letter to her (a business one, written last spring!).
As you see, there again I am no use at all.
You will have either to look for someone with better connections in literary and publishing circles, or to apply directly to several publishers enclosing your book.
[Per-haps Filippov could help you? After all, he has printed something of yours! My relations with him have been broken off.

PLEKHANOV December 1, 1901 I have read, dear G.
V.
, your letter about Finn’s article.
You have proved much stricter.
It seemed to me that the article was not a bad one.
But your arguments have fully convinced me, and I agree to the amputation.
I have already spoken to the author about the need for some changes and cuts.
He did not resist absolutely, but expressed the “wish” that the cuts should not be too heavy, as otherwise, he said, he would find someone else to publish the article.
We shall try to write to the author: we have the address, but it’s not very convenient to write.
However, I will not undertake to correct the article.
That will have to be your job, if the decision is to carry it.
Best wishes, Yours, Frey Your criticism of Finn’s article has made me think again of how poor Iskra’s economic section is, a fact you spoke of at Zurich.
Why don’t you send us anything for this sec-tion? It would be so important to have anything from notes of half a column (4,000 letters, 4-6 of your pages) about current events like the co-operative congress, new data about syndicates, economic reviews in The Economist, ma-jor strikes, fresh statistical data, etc.
, etc.
, to articles of 12-2 columns, or feature articles up to 20-25 thousand letters (up to 30 of your pages)! You seem to be more in touch with economic literature than anyone else, so it wouldbe easiest for you to draw up such notes, even occasionally! Do try and help us, or Iskra will become monotonous.
Of course I would not even dream of distracting you from your work on the programme, which is urgently needed and has first priority; but it would be possible to write small notes and little articles in between, about the new issues of economic journals, etc.
Iskra’s historical section is also weak: feature articles telling about the European revolutions, and so forth.
I think that here we could even translate.
Please send us suitable material; you once said you had something in view.

If the letter has not been lost, it is a scandal that he has delayed it! I am writing to him immediately.
I support Alexei’s opinion that you must go.
Krichevsky can do us harm—and now that the decisive struggle is begin-ning, we should keep an eye on him.
We won’t be able to get along with them.
I am sending you 230 marks: 80 marks= 100 francs for the International Bureau, and 150 marks for the trip.
Will that be enough? Take a circular ticket (the period is 2 months) with a break at Munich (if it’s imprudent to do so from Geneva, order it in Zurich).
At Zurich persuade P.
B.
to come too.
Then we shall all be together at the beginning of January, and shall have done both with the programme (this is im-portant) and with No.
4 of Zarya, etc.
I am expecting Zarya any day now.
I already sent P.
B.

Write a little report or a note for Iskra on the sessions of the International Secretariat.

I have always said that the distribution of functions tends to resolve of itself: over here, the literature is pub-lished, articles are written for the paper, etc.
In Russia, the literature is distributed and contacts are established.
Transport is handled by special persons, appointed by mutual agreement of those here and there, and connected with both sides.
Such is the ideal.
.
.
.
.
.
.
We have long been concerned over the fact that organ-isation in Russia (a matter of first-rate importance) has been making such slow headway, and, you will recall, we even sent you a “plan” last summer 117 (unfortunately we have not kept a copy of the letter elaborating the “plan”).
But you replied: “We have no men.
” You now seem to have found it possible to get down to this, and we are all ready, of course, to help all of you, if it depends on us.
But our role here is quite a subordinate one.
You are connected with X.
Y.
Z.
118 ; consequently, all the “sources” of liter-ature are within your reach.
Establish contacts with one another, and turn these sources to use; if you find people who are suitable and have earned your complete confidence, make up a management committee from among them by joint agreement and we shall of course write to everyone we can to have them abide by the committee’s instructions.
What is essential though is that the management committee should without fail have in view the whole of Russia, and not by any means one district only, because Iskra’s whole future depends on whether it will be able to overcome local rule-of-thumb work and district separateness, and become an all-Russia paper in practice.

V.
’s programme and our scheme for a “settlement in committee ” , 121 through a com-mittee of arbitration sui generis.
This scheme seems to be falling through because of G.
V.
’s unwillingness, but I don’t yet know this for certain.
I should like to know your impression of G.
V.
’s new draft and which of the two drafts you now favour.
The copying of your pamphlet 1 2 2 has only just been started: up to now the copyist was busy with copying for Iskra (with Tsvetov away, Iskra has been making very slow headway: only one issue will appear in March).
Evidently delay is inevitable if your pamphlet is to be published here; but if you are very much opposed to this, let me know, and we may then send it on to Geneva.
If speed is not so im-portant for you, then as soon as the copying is finished and Tsvetov returns, the pamphlet will be sent to the printers.
A few more words about the programme.
We consider it very undesirable to put it up for a vote by the whole League (instead of the editorial board alone), respective * have a discussion in the press among ourselves (although this will not be easy to avoid if the attempt to reach agreement fails).
What is your opinion? All the very best wishes for your health.

AXELROD March 27, 1902 Dear P.
B.
, I have just received your letter, and hasten to reply.
I very much like your idea of printing the article in Zarya, instead of as a pamphlet (a supplement to Iskra), both in general and in particular, on account of our plans for moving to London (Yevgeny is writing to you about it).
123 About half of your article is already copied, and I shall send it to you directly it is finished: the work of copying is going ahead quickly now.
It will be a fine thing to have a maga-zine-type article in Zarya.
As for the changes that may be required on account of the letter being addressed “to Iskra”, they will be insignificant.
No one, so far as I am aware, has begun or intends to write any review on Kanun revolutsii.
124 Therefore please do write it: what we are short of in Zarya is reviews.
As for the programme, I will send you my comments on G.
V.
’s draft in a few days (my sick friend now has them) 125; I showed them to my friends here, and they persuaded me not to send them to G.
V.
, in view of the proposals which had been made for an “arbitration or conciliation” com-mittee.
But I would be very happy to send them to you personally to show you my Bedenken * set forth therein systematically.
As regards our meeting, 126 however, I don’t think it could bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion just at present.
I don’t know what the whole board will decide (we shall be acquainting it with your plan this very day), but I personally very much fear that in the absence * Considerations.
—Ed.
of an already prepared third draft, in the absence of a new make-up of those voting, in the absence of any firm agree-ment on how to vote, who is to vote and what significance is to be attached to the voting, our Zurich meeting would once again be inconclusive.
And you are a thousand times right about the importance of issuing a programme.
Have you seen Borba’s Kalendar 127 ? How did you like it? No.

That’s hard work! Forgive me for the brevity and hastiness of this letter.

BOGDANOV Dear Comrades, We are very glad about your proposal for the publication of pamphlets.
There is, in fact, a certain lack of pamphlets, and we could easily publish them in any quantity.
(As regards transport, we cannot at the moment guarantee regular delivery en masse, but we hope that this too will be constantly improving.
) However we beg you not to insist on the stipulation that pamphlets should be accepted or reject-ed en bloc, without any partial changes at all.
This stipu-lation is extremely inconvenient, and will hold up every-thing terribly.
Take the very first article sent to us, about organisation (the technical problems of organisation).
In the general opinion of the editorial board, this article (in-teresting and valuable though it is) cannot appear in this shape, because it contains quite inappropriate and tactless remarks (like “one-man rule” and “dictatorship by one member of the committee”, etc.
); and there are also minor defects requiring correction.
Yet an agreement about such changes, not particularly essential from the author’s stand-point (but unquestionably necessary), could be reached without any difficulty at all.
Think this over well, and don’t hold up an important undertaking out of a desire to impose particularly restrictive conditions on us.
We repeat that the article is, on the whole, practical and valuable; in general, we are even prepared to agree to the stipulation that articles should be accepted or rejected as a whole, without partial corrections.
But, then, under this, stipulation, we should be obliged to reject your very first article, and that would be harmful to the cause.
After all, it would surely be possible to come to an agreementwith the author about any partial corrections.
Why don’t you try and let us make these corrections by way of expe-riment? If you like we shall write to you in greater detail about what precisely should be changed.

Remember: all this is of the utmost importance! Be bolder, more pushy and more inventive in this respect, and in all others, as discreet and as careful as possible.

RADCHENKO We have just given the Bundist contact with you.
This concerns the congress.
You and he (&a bureau or someone else) must form a Russian Committee for preparing the congress.
Behave as impressively as you can and act with caution.
Take on yourself the greatest possible number of districts in which you undertake to prepare for the con-gress, refer to the bureau (giving it some other name), in a word, make sure that the whole thing is entirely in your hands, leaving the Bund, for the time being, confined to the Bund.
We shall begin negotiations here about a rap-prochement over here, and will inform you immediately.
And so, for the time being, have in mind the composition of a Russian Committee for Preparing the Congress which is most advantageous for us (you may find it convenient to say that you have already formed this committee, and are very glad to have the Bund participate or something like this).
Take on yourself, without fail, to be secretary in this com-mittee.
These are the first steps.
And then we shall see.
I say have the composition “in mind” to have as free a hand as possible: don’t commit yourself to the Bund right away (you can say, for example, that connections have been established with the Volga, the Caucasus, the centre—we have a man from over there—and the South—we’re sending two down there), and make yourself master of the under-taking.
But do all this most carefully, without rousing objections.
Write whether your role is clear to you.
Perhaps we shall yet have time to exchange letters.
Make certain to send the weekly paper regularly to Rög-ner’s address: we need the most regular correspondence.
And we should like to send a special weekly: let us have as quickly as possible the address of a doctor, a technician, a cyclist, an artiste, and so on, and so forth.

PLEKHANOV July 2, 1902 Dear G.
V.
, Excuse my writing in such a hurry.
I have come here to Brittany for a rest (I am awaiting my family here as well), 131 but in Paris Berg gave me his item, and I have received the article over the signature of Veteran which you sent.
I am completely in agreement with Veteran.
On account of the note about Lekkert in Iskra I had a little battle with Berg and Velika Dmitrievna, who both, as usual, had an attack of nerves, and began to talk about the inevitability of terror, and the need for us to express this (in one way or another).
The item in Iskra was thus a compromise: that was all I managed to secure.
132 Now Berg himself has become more resolutely opposed to terror, even that of the Lekkerts.
But the question is whether it is all right to insert your article with the Veteran signature.
Of course, if you wish, it will certainly go in (and there is time for it to go into the next issue)—but wouldn’t it be better for you to turn it into a leading article for No.
22, combining it, so to speak, with Berg’s article “How to Fight”? I enclose this article which, in my opinion, contains passages requiring corrections, passages which are undesirably evasive on the question of Lekkert.
I also enclose an item about the priest’s letter.
What is your opinion? And so please reply as soon as possible, dear G.
V.
, and send all three articles straight back to London (J.
Richter, 30.
Holford Sq.
30.
Pentonville: London W.
C.
).
Write to me at the same address.
I think a leader would be the best place to say what you do say: the substance of the matter will be brought out (the “objection” to Iskra will be smoothed out) and the integral impression will be made stronger.
You will find it easy and natural to develop your article into a leader, thereby substituting it for the article “How to Fight”.
Such a substitution would, in my opinion, be the best result.

I received today your letter, the proofs and the money.
Merci.
There is some damned muddle altogether about this “congress” in Switzerland.
133 Who was it (first of all) who thought of a “congress”? Not we.
It was probably invented by B.
N.
, who ought really to be given a good head-washing for irresponsible behaviour (his tour of Europe, his idle talk with Korenevsky about the congress, etc.
); if you haven’t done it already, please give him a thorough talking to.
I was thinking of doing it myself, but I suppose you will do it better, because I am very angry.
No one is arranging a “congress”: a congress requires that everyone should be there (whereas we know nothing for sure about Arkady and Sonya 134 ).
A “congress” requires some of those abroad (like Dimka, the old fellows, maybe Alexandrova and others), and that has not even been men-tioned.
No one has even been preparing a programme for a congress, and no one knows what to talk about at one: About the Iskra organisation in Russia? Without any delegates from that organisation itself? All of this is amazingly hasty and ill-considered! L.
Gr.
himself is now postponing it “until the autumn”.
Will you, too, help to “blast” this “congress” nonsense? It is essential right away to see Lapot: he will both see the Swiss and will himself come and see us.
What else is there? Then there’s Povar, who evidently still needs some training— so let him study at Zurich: that will be excellent.
Maybe he, like B.
N.
, will remain abroad for months?! Why hurryto see him, then? When he wants to go, he himself will have to come and see us, so there is no need to drag him over now.
And what is this nonsense that B.
N.
and V.
V.
have been writing to Berg? “We can’t talk except in the presence of P.
B.
” Talk with whom? Povar? He is at P.
B.
’s.
With the three persons? They are at P.
B.
’s.
With Lapot? He will be visiting P.
B.
Advise Berg to give V.
V.
and B.
N.
a thorough bawling-out for this nonsense, and write to me what Berg thinks about it, and whether there is any hope that he himself will reply to them in a way that will discourage them from talking nonsense.
Besides, P.
B.
himself went to Munich, and will come to London as well.
No one doubts that a visit from G.
V.
is (will be) necessary.
I wrote to G.
V.
that I know nothing about a “congress ” , but that it is essential to have a business-like meeting (with Lapot and others) in London, where, of course, he also will be.
If necessary, I will write to him again.
Try pressing L.
Gr.
in every way in order to dissuade him: he has no clear idea of who is to attend this “congress”, for what purpose it is to be held, and how it is to proceed.

RADCHENKO A Letter to Arkady Dear Friend, I have read your long letter of June 6 * over again, and want to add something to my previous letter.
136 I was very glad indeed to have your report of a talk with the workers.
Such letters are a great rarity for us, and they really invigorate us.
Be sure to pass this on to your workers, with our request that they themselves should write to us not only for publication, but simply to exchange ideas and not to lose contact and mutual understanding.
I personally am particularly interested, in this connection, in what the workers will think of What Is To Be Done=, because I have not yet had any views from workers.
And so give us a direct contact with your group of workers, and also with Manya 137: this is very important, and will very much consolidate both their closer approach to Iskra and your own position among them.
And then, if there are really capable people among Manya’s leaders, it would be a good thing for one of them to come and see us: suggest this to them and find out what they think of it.
Then there are three more points.
(1) If Vanya 138 is with us, how are you to determine your relations with him? What is your opinion? Perhaps, if Vanya and Manya are entirely on our side (and if they issue the statement I wrote of—this is extremely important), they could include you in their Central Committee 139 and in addition formally confirm you in your function for the special work of unification on an all-Russia scale (i.
e.
, “The Central Committee authorises N.
N.
, who is one of its members and a member of the Iskra organisation in Rus-sia, an organisation with which the C.
C.
is in complete * June 19, N.
S.
—Ed.
solidarity, to be in charge of work in preparation for Party unity, in the Iskra spirit”).
Perhaps it might be varied in this way (of course I am suggesting all this only tentatively, no more): “The C.
C.
of the St.
Petersburg Committee, expressing its complete solidarity with the Iskra organisation in Russia, is happy to co-opt to the Committee, with its full consent, a group of persons belonging to that organisation and specially engaged in transporting Iskra and distributing it through-out Russia.
The C.
C.
assigns such-and-such members to assist this group and allocates such-and-such funds, and one of the members of this group (Arkady) enters the C.
C.
of the St.
Petersburg Committee, while remaining a member of the Iskra organisation in Russia, and takes special charge of preparations for all-Party unity in the Iskra spirit.
” By the group I mean the persons you sent for fish, 140 etc.
I repeat that I am only suggesting various acceptable and possible propositions, in fulfilment of your request to sug-gest a “concrete draft of a plan”, and leaving it to your discretion to make use of my suggestions in one form or another.
Be sure to write how things stand at present, and in what direction you are moving them.
Strike the iron while it is hot, and remember that we have to come to a mutual agreement in as detailed a form as possible about the plan for finally and irrevocably winning over the “tun-ing fork” (= the St.
Petersburg Committee= Vanya).
And you must be as wise as a serpent with your young friends! If this is possible, it would be best of all.
Then you would be a delegate from Vanya in the Organising Committee (preparing for Sasha 141 , and one more of our people could be in it from Sonya.
Write as soon as you can what you think of all this, and whether you have talked about it with Vanya and with Manya.
(2) It is you who must without fail set up an Organising Committee in Russia, and take it into your own hands: you on behalf of Vanya, Claire on behalf of Sonya&one more of our people from the South—that is the ideal.
Be extremely careful and restrained with the Bund, without showing your hand, and letting it deal with Bundist affairs but not allowing it to stick its nose into Russian affairs: remember that there you have an unreliable friend (and maybe even an enemy).
(3) Explain to everyone everywhere that it is pure gos-sip that Iskra’s editorial board itself wants to become the Russian Party’s C.
C.
It is nonsense.
The C.
C.
can exist only in the field of operations, and our hope is that it will devel-op out of the Organising Committee and revolutionary workers.
The relationship between Iskra’s editorial board and the C.
C.
would be determined by the division of func-tions principle (ideological leadership and practical direc-tion), with regular congresses serving to ensure unity, or possibly the attachment of one of the five (as an assumption) members of the C.
C.
here as a permanent delegate.
The gossip is being spread by Borba, and it must be exposed.
We don’t want to reply in print to these rogues: the best way to punish them is for Iskra to be silent.
Perhaps Vanya’s doubts (about which you wrote) are also due to his vague idea of all this? Make sure that both Vanya and still more Manya are quite clear about it.
All the very best, and hopes above all that you will manage to hold out.
Yours, Lenin [P.
S.
If it should come into Vanya’s head to demand a precise definition of relations between Manya and himself, between his members and the members of Manya who are in the St.
Petersburg C.
C.
, I think this would be best post-poned until we meet here, and that Vanya should be told straight: “One of two things—either we really see eye to eye; and then a month of work together will see us working so smoothly that there will not remain the slightest shadow of misunderstanding between us, because we shall all be Iskrists.
Or else we shall find ourselves in disagreement— in which case we shall part ways in a proper manner.
But we don’t want to look silly once again by drawing up agreements, etc.
!” From your letter of June 6 I see that you replied to them at the outset in this sense, and of course it was an excellent thing to do.

3 Printed from the originalTO ALEXANDRA KALMYKOVA September 27, 1902 I have received your letter.
Many thanks for your de-tailed reply.
Until Viscount arrives I will not, as you wish, either raise the general question of finance or give any infor-mation about your letter, except in general terms, i.
e.
, neither about how you define the body of “holders”, nor about what amount you specify, nor about how soon you can provide it (the whole immediately, or in instal-ments).
We shall, in any case, have vertrauliche * talks with Viscount about all the most important questions; so it will be best for me first of all to show him your letter, and to decide jointly with him on the limits, so to speak, of any further information about its contents.
I personally incline to the view that for the time being it would be best not to tell anyone about the whole amount (to keep it secret), nor to tell absolutely anyone about the possibility of obtaining it all at once, because at the pres-ent moment there’s an infinity of “possible” expenditure on “possible” undertakings.
The abundance of escapes is putting a mass of people at Iskra’s “disposal”, provided all of them are given maintenance, but if we start this on a grand scale, frivolously and in haste, we shall find our-selves “on the rocks” within six months or a year.
On the other hand, if we are more “tight-fisted”, a fairly large number of peripheral undertakings manage “to make do with their own resources”.
In view of this, it is best to arrange matters in the old way (i.
e.
, to speak to all those who participate in this way): you can provide a good deal * Confidential.
—Ed.
yet, let us say, “over 10 thousand”, but, first, not all at once, and second, you wish to provide only in extreme necessity, advising them to seek regular sources to cover current expenses themselves.
I repeat that so far this is my personal opinion, and I don’t yet know Viscount’s opi-nion.
We wanted to raise the question with him here about some “amicable”, “friendly” division of functions, start-ing from the principle that after all it is better to take advantage of peace to bring about a stable modus vivendi than to postpone matters once more until some “accidental” conflict.
But whether this will succeed, whether we shall decide in this way, whether it will be convenient to raise the question—all this is still unknown.
At present, we are very hard up for money, and there are some urgent expenses.
Therefore, please send ,000 marks immediately, if possible: what you can, of this amount, at once, and what you have to draw, as soon as possible (and let us know when it will arrive).
But in my opinion you should already draw a larger amount: draw some 3,0 0 0 rubles and keep it at home, so that we could get it from you at short notice.
Otherwise we literally don’t know how to get out of it: we already owe 150 rubles, and are putting off a payment of 50 rubles next week.
We need about 300 rubles for departures (quite essential), about 200 for the people here soon, etc.
Write as soon as you can what ar-rangements you have made, when and how much you will be receiving.
I shall pass on what you say to Brock.
There is a crowd of people here, and altogether too much commotion.
Yet many more are arriving in the next few days! You write nothing about your plans for coming here, and very vaguely about your health: only that you don’t feel well, but what is the matter? I am also worried about the lack of news from home.

To add anything to these speeches would only mean weaken-ing the impression created by this ingenuous account of the workers’ misery, of the growing indignation among them and of their readiness to fight.
It is now our duty to make every effort to have these speeches read by tens of thousands of Russian workers.
The example of Zalomov, Bykov, Sa-mylin, Mikhailov and their comrades, who courageously stood up in court for their fighting call: “Down with the autocracy!”, will inspire the whole working class of Russia to equally heroic and resolute struggle for the freedom of the whole people, and the freedom of steady working-class advance to the bright socialist future.

We implore Zarin to link us up directly with some member of the Committee, some-one who is conscientious and mobile and who knows everything that is going on.
Every leaflet (whoever issues it) must be sent immediately to two different addresses in two copies, one in an envelope, another wrapped up in a Russian newspaper.
Then we must immediately be given contact with Vakar.
We are very much afraid that the Kiev Iskrists, owing to their inactivity and onlooker attitude, will suffer the same fate as that of the St.
Petersburg Is-krists.
Not a word either about receipt and distribution (N.

16 of Rabochaya Mysl, pub-lished in Geneva, apparently by Nadezhdin? Are you really going to let this pass too without a protest? What a scandal that leaflet No.
1 of Rabochaya Mysl was burned 146 : of course, there were some things in it that needed correcting, and drastically at that.
But then why wasn’t it done? It’s quite incomprehensible what is going on at your end! Why has the printed leaflet on the 200th anniversary of the press been delayed 147 ? Send us immediately every leaflet, your own and other people’s, workers’ and students’, all without exception, with a note saying whether they may be quoted and whether they were distributed—two copies of each to two addresses, either simply in envelopes or wrapped up inside a legal newspaper sent by book-post, only with a strong wrapper crosswise.
Why don’t you send to Iskra the St.
Petersburg Commit-tee reports of the money you collect? Be sure to do this.
There is great need of workers’ letters from St.
Peters-burg; please do your best to get some, especially about unemployment, and then about the impression created by our literature.
Correct leaflet No.
1 of Rabochaya Mysl, rewriting it in a more restrained and more business-like tone, and be sure to publish the story of the split within the Committee.
Nadezhdin’s Rabochaya Mysl cannot, I emphasise, cannot be let off without a public protest.

NOSKOV To Claire and Boris from Starik Dear Friends, Kurtz is writing to you about yesterday’s meeting.
148 There is no longer any hope, absolutely no hope of peace.
You can’t imagine even a tenth of the outrages to which the Martovites have sunk here, poisoning the whole atmosphere abroad with their spiteful gossip, encroaching on our con-tacts, money, literary material, etc.
War has been declared, and they (Lyuba, Kostya, Yeryoma) are already on their way to fight in Russia.
Get ready for the most legal but desperate struggle.
We must by all means fill the places on all committees without exception with our own people.
Special attention should be paid to Kharkov, Yekaterino-slav and Rostov.
Is it true that the Kiev Committee has adopted a resolution backing the Minority? Is that pos-sible? Why weren’t we told earlier? I would very strongly advise you to co-opt Konyaga and Ignat.
You will soon see and get to know the former.
About the latter I will say this: in wartime he is, truly, useful and essential; he will be quite loyal; he can be kept away from functions for which he is not fit; there is much idle gossip about him; there is no need to fear that he will co-opt God knows whom, because Kurtz will be staying here, and we shall take care of him.
I repeat that I strongly ad-vise you to take in Ignat, but, of course, it is entirely up to you; I have made Ignat give me a solemn promise that he would obey his chiefs in all things (and admitted to him that he should be prepared for not being co-opted).
Please be sure to get the Bureau to function properly,so that we should get weekly letters from you.
I would ask you even more earnestly to have Brutus go underground: it’s not worth while perishing cheaply.
Let him travel all over the place in the next two or three months, and then come here to replace Kurtz.
This step is really essential.
We have seen Lebedev.
Ruben is here also.
Gurvich and Khinchuk are Martovites.
Hurry up with your reply about the Council.
You should at once make a formal appointment of one more member representing you, and he should transfer his vote to Kurtz.
Please don’t delay.

To Odessa From Lenin, C.
C.
member abroad and member of the Council Comrades, We have been informed privately that the majority of the Nikolayev Committee is accused of incorrect action.
150 I should very much like to be clear on what happened.
Be so kind as to reply to me immediately yourselves (and ask for an immediate reply to me also from the comrades who are at present members of the Nikolayev Committee, passing this letter on to them) on the following questions: (1) Who were the members of the Nikolayev Committee before the raid of March 8-9? A full list of conspirative names is essential.
How many members were there in all? How many supported the Minority and how many the Major-ity? (2) Were all the members of the Nikolayev Committee arrested on March 8-9? If not, how many remain? How many belong to the Majority, and how many to the Minority? (3) Was or was there not a formal resolution of the Ni-kolayev Committee (before the raid of March 8-9) on the nomination of candidates? If there was, when was it adopted, how many candidates were nominated and who precisely were they? (4) Have there been arrests in the Nikolayev Committee since March 8-9? What changes in its composition did each of these arrests bring about?(5) Were or were not Comrades S.
and O.
(members of the Minority with whom there was a dispute) members of the Nikolayev Committee before the raid? Did they or did they not work in Nikolayev earlier? If they did, when, how long, in what capacity, in which group, in which line, etc.
? When precisely did S.
and O.
come to Nikolayev? (6) How many days after the wholesale arrests (March 8-9) did Comrade N.
come to Nikolayev? (7) What right had Comrade N.
to declare Comrades S.
and O.
members of the Nikolayev Committee, without consulting Comrades V.
and A.
, members of the Nikolayev Committee, and without obtaining their consent? (8) Did Comrades S.
and O.
make any complaint about being members of the Nikolayev Committee without any appointment and without co-optation? If they did, please state in detail on what grounds.
(9) What connections were Comrades S.
and O.
supposed to hand over to Comrades V.
, N.
and A.
? Where did Com-rades S.
and O.
get these connections? Who gave these con-nections to them, and when? (10) Why did S.
and O.
not recognise Comrades V.
and A.
as the Committee? (11) What official organisations of the Nikolayev Com-mittee existed at the time of the raid of March 8-9, i.
e.
, what groups of agitators, of organisers, of propagandists, etc.
, and how many such groups? Please list all without fail, and state how many members there were in each, how many of the Minority and how many of the Majority? (12) When was the group of agitators whose meeting of 10 on April 20 adopted a resolution in favour of the Major-ity formed? Was it before the raid or after the raid? Was its composition changed after the raid, and how precisely? Did or did not this group (or some other groups) have a for-mal or tacit right to nominate candidates for membership of the local Committee? (13) Do you happen to know from where, and with whose help (in cash, etc.
), S.
and O.
were sent? Written in Geneva at the end of May 1 9 0 4 First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XV Printed from the originalTO V.

BONCH-BRUYEVICH July 26, 1904 Dear Vladimir Dmitrievich, Thank you for your letter of 23.
7.
04 about our affairs.
151 I reply point by point.
As regards general policy, I am still for an armed peace, for retreats with protests (as we said in our talk with Nina Lvovna in the presence of yourself and Martyn Nikolaye-vich), in short, for our old tactics.
Protest against every infringement, publish, agitate, without giving them any pretexts for the coup d’état which they desire.
As to the details of particular measures, you can judge better on the spot.
That C.
C.
agents were not given any papers is the direct fault of Boris, who was the last to leave.
152 I have already written to Martyn Nikolayevich that I advise him to ex-plain to the C.
O.
editorial board the absurdity of demanding the papers: tell them Boris has been written to twice, there is a report about his arrest, so must we really wait six months for a reply from Russia? Keep protesting—but de facto you will still be carrying on everything.
As regards finance, I have the feeling that we were rash in taking on the library: it’s not luxuries we need, it’s sustenance.
Do you remember my telling you this? And the 300 francs have been spent! Please, do be careful, don’t let yourself be carried away by the library, 153 keep your mind on the cause as a whole.
My best greetings to Ignat.
How does he feel? I am terribly worried about Nina Lvovna.
Write at once if you hear anything.
To my mind, we must issue a reply to Plekhanov (in pamphlet form, not as a leaflet, and with a short preface) if the C.
O.
fails to publish it despite all our protests.
And don’t be late with this, or it will lose its interest.
154 Every good wish, and greetings to Vera Mikhailovna and all our friends.

BONCH-BRUYEVICH Dear Vladimir Dmitrievich, I have received your letter and hasten to reply.
I simply cannot understand why you fell out, and what the point is.
155 I don’t see why not sell 20-30 copies of Zarya and why this should be “running ahead of things”.
I should think this was the kind of routine matter in forwarding that could be left entirely to the manager of the forwarding section, i.
e.
, to you.
I am writing this very day to Martyn Nikolayevich asking him to try and clear up the misunder-standing.
You shouldn’t be too much upset about indivi-dual expressions, even sharp ones, even unfair ones.
You see, surely, that we are all very edgy—the cause of it all is the rotten situation created by the new traitors in the C.
C.
Maybe we shall now soon put an end to all this, once and for all, and make a fresh start—then the basis for petty conflicts will disappear.
In the meantime, we must try and see it through patiently, and I would reply to caustic remarks by jokes about “the deadly destroyer ” .
156 I quite understand your irritation, but joking seems to be the only answer.
If a dispute arises, drag out its solution, write to us here, that’s all you should do.
Please take all possible steps to accelerate the appearance of (1) the pamphlet by Ryadovoi and Galyorka, (2) your statement with the documents, (3) Galyorka’s pamphlet which was sent today.
157 How is Ilya? He visited me yesterday, I told him what was in hand, 158 but he still can’t make up his mind.
Has he been given my (1) letter on the subject of the agreement of 26.

Have matters been arranged about the co-operative print-ing press 162 ? Hurry.
Ilya says there is a rumour that Glebov has a letter of resignation from Travinsky.
We shall look into it and check.
They’re a nice lot, aren’t they? Five and four are argu-ing; two of the five resign; two of the four are taken— then the three, instead of resigning, stage a coup d’état163 ! Yours, N.

LEITEISEN September 29, 1904 Dear Comrade, I was very pleasantly surprised by reports from Sergei Petrovich and Martyn Nikolayevich about your political stand at the present time.
I need not tell you how painful it has been for me, over the last twelve months, to see a break in the good relations which had previously always existed between us.
In view of these reports, I think it would not be worth our while to look back to the past: we could probably resume our old relations exclusively on the basis of our common positive tasks of the present and the future.
If I am mistaken in this, you will, of course, correct my error; but I feel it to be my duty, after my talk with Martyn Nikolayevich, to make a first attempt to clarify frankly and directly how we stand.

We were acquainted and saw each other so long ago (at Samara in 1892-93) that it would be difficult for us to renew our friend-ship without the help of new friends.
And I should very much like to renew it.
For this purpose I am sending you, taking advantage of the address I have, a detailed letter about our affairs, and earnestly ask you to reply personally and as soon as you can.
It is quite impossible to work together unless there is regular correspondence, but up to now Saratov has been in the habit of keeping a stubborn silence for months at a time.
Please see that all this is changed now, and begin to write us yourself as circumstantially as possible.
Without detailed letters from you personally it will be impossible to get a clear picture either of your personal activity in the cause or of Saratov conditions in general.
Please make yourself spend 2 or 3 hours a week on this.
I send you very best greetings and good wishes.

ESSEN To Baron from Lenin November 4, 1904 Dear Comrade, The many reports I have had about you oblige me to beg you to leave your work temporarily and come here for a month.
I understand perfectly how carried away you are by your work, and how hard it is for you to tear yourself away from it, but, after all, we must think of deploying our forces from the standpoint of the general plan of the cam-paign.
We need experienced workers, and you must find some young people to substitute for you temporarily, and come over here without fail to settle some common problems, to tell us about all your conclusions from your journeys, and to confer about the new steps we are taking.
This is quite necessary, otherwise we shall be left without reserves in any serious contingency in the future.
Please reply to me personally as soon as possible, and I entreat you not to postpone your journey even for as long as a week.
You’ve been intending to come for a long time; but keep putting it off.
It may end badly: I’ve seen it happen before.
My best wishes, and hope to see you soon.

YERAMASOV Dear Friend, Your help was extremely valuable to us in general and to me in particular.
If I have not yet made any special request of you, it was because there has been no extremity, but I have been confident of the utmost possible support on your part.
At the present time, a moment of extremity is approaching, a situation so serious that I could not even imagine anything of the kind before.
Our undertaking is threatened with complete collapse, unless we manage to hold out for at least six months with the help of extraordin-ary resources.
And to do that without folding up our activ-ities we need a minimum of two thousand rubles a month: for editing, publishing, transport, and equipment of the most essential agents.
That is why I now address this most urgent request to you to help us out and procure this sup-port for us.
Please let me know as soon as possible whether you are able to fulfil this request of ours.
Written in December 1 9 0 4 Sent from Geneva to Russia First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XV Printed from the original1905 TO *** 167 March 9, 1905 Dear Friend, I am unable to answer most of your questions, because I myself know no more than you do.
It looks as if Voinov is not in favour of a single centre.
The Russians are.
Whether or not it will go through, I don’t know.
I am more in fa-vour of the old system, 168 but do not attach any particular importance to it.
The crux of the problem is consultations between the Central Committee and the editorial board— and that in effect brings us back again to some sort of Council.
“Then we shall see.
” I can’t write about you to Moscow, because I have no personal friends there, and one has to be careful with such things.
It is better to wait and see how they decide them-selves.
I will send you the outline of my report (“The Tasks of the Third Congress”) if I find it * : it is very brief, almost what was said in “From the Editors”, in Vperyod.
169 I have not so far been able to find out what sort of con-sent there was on the part of the Central Committee to a congress.
I myself was very much afraid of a skilful C.
C.
intrigue—you saw our attitude in Vperyod.
170 Now the Minority C.
C.
have nearly all been arrested, only Fisher, * I have found it.
I can’t send it, because it is hieroglyphics on a scrap of paper.
My advice is to concentrate on the experience of the Second Congress.
Nikitich and Karp remain.
Stein and Povar 171 have also been arrested.
This will probably weaken the Mensheviks for a long time.
Over here, dear old Martov has a real fit at his club at any mention of the congress.
Judging by this, they won’t come.
But who can know for certain? I am ready even for the worst: for a split on our part, but con-sider this improbable.
Don’t tell me you have not even managed to get a min-ute of Deutsch’s most disgusting boasts.
Why, that is unheard of! One couldn’t even expect such impudence.
You should have forced him up against the minutes, published a list of “their” groups or at least passed the minutes on for the congress, so as to show the Russians the boundless impudence of these gentlemen.

173 I think you will have time enough to go to Liege, if you can return on Sunday, or if you don’t take a return ticket and don’t go back to Paris (probably the best thing will be to take a 45-day circular ticket, Paris—Liège, etc.

It’s hardly possible before Monday, al-though, I repeat, I’m not sure.
Today, April 5, was fixed as the latest date for departure from St.

So far no one has arrived.
On Friday, two will be setting off from here—they may call at your town, but strictly incognito.

To be on the safe side, I will explain what it is about.
I have been summoned to Paris on business.
I want on no account to waste my time in travelling merely for this reason, but to give a lecture.
The subject: “The Third Congress and Its Decisions”.
The contents: a parallel analysis of our decisions and those of the Mensheviks.
They have just issued an announcement about their conference, and I will analyse it.
I can speak only on Tuesday (I will be arriving on Monday, but my evening will be taken up) and must finish in one day.
If you can, hire the biggest hall (where I spoke against Struve— Filatov and the others will know) and inform the maxi-mum number of people.
If you have not yet telegraphed a clear reply, do so tomorrow, so that I should know exactly whether a hall has been hired.
Perhaps you will even have time to write to me by express (so that I should get it not later than Sunday morning), but if you have something important to report, be sure to cable.
I am giving the same lecture here today.
All the best, Yours, Lenin Tournez s’il vous plaît! * If by any chance it turned out that I couldn’t deliver the lecture, I might not come at all.

September 15, 1905 Dear Comrades, I have received the money, 1,000 rubles—2,640 francs— and the first issue of Rabochy.
It makes an excellent im-pression.
Let us hope that it will largely solve the difficult problem of providing a popular exposition which is not boring.
There is something fresh in the tone and character of the exposition.
A splendid fighting spirit.
In short, let me congratulate you on this success with all my heart, and wish for more.
So far, I have the following minor remarks: (1) a little more should be said about socialism, in view of the “explanatory” nature of the organ, and (2) the fight-ing political slogans should be more closely and directly tied in with the resolutions of the Third Congress, and with the general spirit of our revolutionary Social-Democratic tactics.
Now for your letter of Aug.
24, 1905, 181 which simply amazed us all by its tone.
I.
About information.
You “can do nothing more”.
That is not true, since we find that the Bund, and the Mensheviks, and a number of Bolsheviks can do more, and are doing it.
It is a fact that the C.
C.
member abroad is not as well informed as the Bundists and Iskra.
This should be put right, and maintained steadily through tireless effort.
Here is the most recent example.
We received your active boycott resolution just the other day.
182 People arriving from Russia have known about it since June! And you tell us that you “can do nothing more”? Its late arrival caused discordance between us, through no fault of mine, for, not knowing how you were interpret-ing it, I gave a different interpretation of “active boycott” in Proletary.
There you have another fact of the two-centre situation which you have restored .
In substance, the discordance turned out not to be great, but still it is undesirable on a question concerning the course of action of the whole Party.
I believe it to be (1) extremely important and the only correct ap-proach, from the point of view of the decisions of the Third Congress, to put forward directly, as the central point in the agitation campaign, the slogan of insurrection and a provisional revolutionary government.
(2) I think it is quite wrong to advise that meetings of the electors should be “dispersed by force”.
Such tactics would be fatal.
One of the two things: either there are no conditions for using force on a sizable scale—in which case, we should confine ourselves to agitation, speeches, strikes and demonstra-tions, making an effort at persuading the electors and on no account “dispersing them ” .
Or conditions do exist for the use of force on any considerable scale—in which case the force must be directed, not against the electors, but against the police and the government.
In that case, undertake an insurrection.
Otherwise you risk landing in a most absurd situation: the workers “use force to break up” meetings of electors; the government uses force to defend them! This in practice shows the harmfulness of not advancing the straightforward and resolute slogan of insurrection, as a centre of agitation against the Duma: prepare for an insur-rection, try to persuade everybody (including the electors as well) to prepare for an insurrection, explain its objec-tives, forms, methods, conditions, organs and preliminaries.
But don’t use force to no purpose, before it has been accu-mulated, for if you haven’t convinced the electors, it is plain madness and suicide for the Social-Democrats to scat-ter them by force.
Furthermore.

You write that you were not tricking the Organising Committee, but were doing the will of the Third Congress.
I think that you are clearly wrong in this.
I wrote to you as long ago as.
.
.
* about the need to prepare * A space was left in the MS.
after “as long ago as” for the date of the letter to the Central Committee—July 28 (see present edition, Vol.
the conditions for unification, and two congresses to give it effect (in the same place and at the same time, with an obli-gation on the part of each organisation to accept the deci-sions of its own congress).
So there is no difference of opinion there.
But it is a fact that you have forgotten about the secret resolution (I append it below) concerning the obli-gatory endorsement of the conditions of fusion by the Fourth Congress.
That is what I have been insisting on.
Two clauses of the Organising Committee’s statement—Clauses 2 and 3—(Letuchy Listok TsK 183 No.
3, p.
5) speak out directly against unification through a congress.
This cannot be denied.
But you, in your reply, say nothing at all of your disagreement! So the result is that you have set aside the resolution.
That this is a mistake, and that it must be corrected, is beyond doubt.
Then there is another unquestionable mistake: the ab-sence of any direct reply to the Organising Committee.
You write that “it was a question of fusion on the basis of the Third Congress”.
Have a heart, gentlemen! Why deceive yourselves? Why weaken your correct position by obvious hypocrisy? Fusion on the basis of the Third Congress was rejected.
It was offered here both by Vinter and by Vadim directly both to Plekhanov and to the Organising Committee.
Given such a unification, there would have been a single C.
O.
(through his agents, Plekhanov even suggested a “trio” for it).
Given such a unification, there would have been a single C.
C.
, formed out of both halves as an essential con-dition, i.
e.
, the “co-optation” would not have been co-optation but a real fusion.
But this was rejected.
Consequently, there remains ag-reement up to the Fourth Congress, and fusion “on the basis of the Fourth Congress”.
Instead of giving such a direct and clear reply and statement for all to hear, you evade the substance of the question by withholding your opinion from our people (for while the O.
C.
is patently proposing fusion not on the basis of the Third Congress, you reply: this is on the whole acceptable, good, let’s have another 34, pp.
320-22).
N.
K.
Krupskaya crossed out “as long ago as” and wrote “earlier” over it.
—Ed.
talk about it!).
Meanwhile you write to me: “Our ultimatum was the Rules of the Third Congress.
” And you don’t call that self-deception? Why, if you say it in public, in the first place, all the Bolsheviks will laugh you out of court, and, in the second place, the Mensheviks will reply to you in such fashion that all your good intentions about fu-sion will go to the devil! In my opinion, it is better to tell the Party frankly: to our regret, they have rejected unification on the basis of the Third Congress.
Let’s set about preparing for the Fourth Congress in such a way as to have two congresses assemble at the same time and in the same place.
Let’s work out a plan of unification.
Let’s say, in all parallel organisations everywhere there are equal numbers of both groups (à la Nikolayev 184 ).
If so, draw up a list of parallel organisations, a complete list, and poll all of them.
Then there is a Central Committee, shall we say, also half-and-half, i.
e.
, in equal numbers.
With complete unification, there can be no objection in principle to “co-optation” of that kind (though in practice the question is more compli-cated and one must know how many parallel organisations there are, etc).
(In parenthesis: it’s a great pity that in No.
1 of Letuchy Listok you boasted that 2/3 of the Party are on our side.
Thereby you prejudiced any future acceptance of the “half-and-half” principle on your part.
And were you really telling the truth about the 2/3?) Furthermore, the C.
O.
With fusion it would be absurd, in my opinion, to have two Central Organs and I believe it possible that the Bolsheviks will prefer, rather than have this absurd situation, to have their own organ issued by several commit-tees, in accordance with the Party Rules.
If there are two rival Central Organs, unification will be a dead letter.
In that event, it is better to have “agreement”, on a basis similar to that at Nikolayev, i.
e.
, everywhere unification or conciliation commissions, with equal numbers from both sides.
III.
About money.
We were all thunderstruck by your statement that the C.
O.
must be published “on resources from abroad”, and that the bankruptcy of the C.
C.
must begin with the C.
O.
You write that this is not irritation and not a rebuke.
Give me leave not to believe you.
To say thiscalmly, coolly and in all seriousness is to proclaim a rup-ture between the C.
O.
and the Party, and this is something you could not wish.
It is something unheard of to have the Party’s C.
O.
published not with the Party’s resources, but on funds abroad, and to decide that the bankruptcy of the Party must begin (rather than end) with the C.
O.
If we were to take this seriously, instead of regarding it merely as a sign of nervousness on account of temporary difficulties (for in general your turnover is a “fat” one, and your pros-pects both of the 60,000 and the “undertaking” are three times “fatter”), we should have to take immediate steps to start publication “on resources from abroad” of an organ of the Committee of the Organisation Abroad.
But, I re-peat, I regard this monstrous outburst on your part only as a state of nerves, and will await our personal meeting, since, in my opinion, it is not the beginning of a break, but a misunderstanding.

REISNER October 4, 1905 Dear Mikhail Andreyevich, I am very grateful to you for your letter, which gives me even more information than Felix Alexandrovich did in his report of a talk with you, as to the plans and tactics of our so-called Cadets.
185 It was extremely valuable to have your communication that the liberals, Witte, etc.
, are in deadly fear of an active boycott.
I have just received news from Russia that an inter-Party conference of Social-Democrats (both sections of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, the Bund, probably the Letts, etc.
) 186 has been held.
The active boycott tactics have been finally adopted.
Your plan is not clear to me: (1) Do you really think there is the slightest hope that the Cadets will refuse to partici-pate in an election to the Duma? I think there is none.
(2) Don’t you think it better for us, if we are to conclude an agreement with the radicals, to demand a million or so from them for the purpose of arming the Petersburg work-ers, than to have an election to a Constituent Assembly right now? What point will there be in holding an election before or without a fight against Trepov? Of course, this needs to be discussed in greater detail.
I pin my hopes, first, on the meeting you will be having in Berlin over the next few days with one of my friends, 187 and, second, on our meeting here with you about which Felix wrote to us.
Wishing you success in the struggle for an active boycott.
Yours faithfully.

October 25, 1905 Dear Friends, I have just received your letter about my appointment to the International Bureau 188 (it is a pity that you did not appoint Orlovsky, but we can discuss that when we meet) and about a meeting at Odessa (Berlin).
It is essential to have a meeting as soon as possible.
Instead of Odessa, I can suggest Warsaw (Königsberg) 189 —all the conditions are the same, but it’s nearer and more unexpected for the po-lice.
In the latter place all could be ready for you in four days, given the best possible conditions (a legal passport), on which I advise you to begin working energetically at once.
Given worse conditions, the period is still very short, and it would be a good thing, if possible, to increase the number of participants.
If you decide on an unfamiliar city (Königsberg is 22 hours from St.
Petersburg) the meet-ing could be appointed in a café, hotel, or tavern, with the aid of a guide-book.
I am writing this very day to the I.
Bureau for informa-tion about the conference and its date; directly I receive the reply, I will forward it to you.
Please hurry with our meeting, regardless even of the conference with the I.
Bu-reau.
Were minutes taken at the inter-Party conference? If they were, send them to us without fail.

KEDROV Dear Comrade, According to our agreement, the material for Vol.

190 The first volume has been delayed.
I have already handed in 12 sheets for Volume II, another 7 are ready, and I can hand in the remainder (about 5 or 7) very soon.
But I should like to know whether you really require all this material so quickly.
Will you be setting it at once? Have you already sent the 12 sheets of Volume II for set-ting? Will publication be delayed if I send you the end of Volume II later? If it will, I can let you have the end of Volume II immediately, if you want it.
But I have a plan to write, for the end of Volume II, a large work about the distribution of land in Russia (using the new statistical data of 1905) and about municipalisation (taking into account Volume IV of Capital, or Theorien über den Mehr-wert, which also appeared in 1905).
I think it would be of great interest for the public, and would be very timely.
I have already collected nearly all the material for the work and processed part of it.
I need a few weeks to finish it; I hope to be able to write the work in a few weeks.
Please, let me know, therefore, whether you want Vol.
II to be delivered immediately without this new article, or to have it handed in with the new article in about a month or six weeks.

I have written a big work on the subject of the agrarian programme, in which, among other things, I deal in detail with the debate in the Second Duma.
194 I lack some of the documents introduced in the Second Duma.

ROTHSTEIN July 8, 1908 Dear Comrade, As regards the creditor, I have decided to postpone the letter until a plenary meeting of the Central Committee, which is to take place in the very near future.
198 I find it inconvenient to butt in with the meeting of the author-ised Party collegium about to take place.
I shall be very glad to see you here.
I can say little that is definite about the neighbourhood of Geneva: I have been ill all the time since my return from London, and am sitting at home, without seeing anyone who lives in the country.
I know that in France, but quite close to Geneva, there are many good and hardly expensive places.
For example, there is Mornex on the slopes of the Salève, which means that it is fairly high up.
A friend of mine lived there in 1904, and I believe one can stay there on one’s own quite cheaply, and at slightly higher cost at the pensions, but for 4-4 2 francs for sure, because that is the usual price.
One can also find a place a little farther away from Geneva (Mornex is about 7 versts away, I should think, and there is an electric tram up to Salève)—within 10 versts and more, on the slopes of the Jura, but I don’t know what the place is like over there.
I will try and find out something more definite, and will write to you directly I discover anything.
Every good wish, Yours, LeninVI.

ZINOVIEV The last two-thirds of Kamenev’s article are quite bad, and can hardly be edited.
I straightened out the first third (p.
1 to end of p.
5) but am not able to make any further alteration, because I see that what it needs is not editing but complete rewriting.
In this part of the article, Kamenev gives an incredibly woolly and confused expression, with thousands of frills, to his idea (that the Octobrists 200 and the Rightists are fighting over minor matters, that their struggles, dissen-sions, fights are inevitable in bourgeoisifying the monarchy and that from this fighting the revolution follows only in-directly, i.
e.
, provided the proletariat enters the arena, and not directly, not by the bourgeoisie itself “going left”).
To my mind, we cannot publish it in this form.
Either persuade the author to rewrite the last two-thirds— and we shall then “edit” the article, or have a hand your-self at rewriting the last two-thirds almost completely.
I enclose (pp.
1-3 in ink) an approximate plan for its rewriting.

I have sent it to Paris together with the end of my article on Bogdanov202 (which came to 100 lines —2 pages of Proletary in the supplement).
I don’t know now whether you will approve it all.
I leave it entirely to your judgement: I am so sick of writing this article that now I don’t know whether it wouldn’t be better to scrap the whole, and reply to Bogdanov literally in a couple of words about his scandal-mongering regarding the “property of the whole group”.
It’s up to you! I shall write about Plekhanov.
The Swedish strike article should go in as the leader.

March 28, 1910 Dear Comrade, Thank you for sending me Rosa Luxemburg’s articles.
203 I must protest in the strongest possible terms on the main question—regarding the replacement of Warski by Leder.
204 Why, you put us in the most impossible situation! I will not say anything of Leder’s personal qualities (as they caught the eye in work together at congresses and conferences: these impressions of him did not at all testify to any knowledge, capacities, literary taste, understanding of the business, and often bore witness to petty faultfinding, etc.
, etc.
—you will appreciate that I am writing to you, too, privatissime * ).
I won’t enlarge on the fact that it is not right to substitute an inexperienced and scarcely suit-able person for an experienced writer, a sensible Marxist and an excellent comrade.
But I will speak about the position of the C.
O.
editorial board and about the crisis in the Party.
You surely cannot have failed to notice the critical situation.
Warski and I write to the Central Committee about a change in the composition of the C.
O.
(Dan is clearly disrupting it).
The liquidators 205 are disrupting the C.
C.
And in these circumstances, just when there is unquestionable need of * Strictly confidentially.
—Ed.
a man who was at the plenum, who has been tested in the work, who is working nicely with the board, who has begun a serious war with a serious enemy—just at that moment he is being replaced by a new man! Where’s your fear of God? Don’t you see it means paralysing the C.
O.
? After all, the C.
O.
is now the only organ of leadership for the whole Party (until the C.
C.
gets together again after its disruption by the liquidators).
It is terribly important to have the C.
O.
in working trim—and this is surely no time “to begin all over again”, to “initiate” a newcomer, to argue instead of getting on with the job.
Please do try to understand that, in order to find loopholes, the Mensheviks, relying on the plenum (and formally they have an unquestionable right to rely on it), argue about every single word in the resolu-tion, its every omission, every incident at the plenum (even the tiniest).
Now, is it conceivable, in the situation, to have a man play the part of pendulum when he was not present at the plenum and has not worked with us in the central bodies of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
for years and years? Why, this is absolutely impossible! It means blocking the whole busi-ness—and that at a time when highly important questions come up for decision at every meeting.
Why, Leder will be obliged to say “I don’t know” to the thousands of argu-ments and the cavilling of the Mensheviks (who, as you know very well, are devilishly skilful at making use of every fraktioneller Dreck * ).
Now, I ask you, can we have such a man at such a time? No.
No.
We are not demanding anything excessive of the P.

We are not overburdening Warski, and are not preventing him from doing Polish literary work.
But you must let us have him in the C.

Without Warski, we are absolutely not in a position to “tide over” the period of crisis, i.
e.
, to secure a change in the composition of the C.

Now, when the crisis is over, when the composition of the C.
O.

I took steps at once to get a grant for him.
As matters stand, it is hopeless to try and get it through the Central Committee’s Bureau Abroad, because there we are now in a minority.

Printed from the originalTO KARL RADEK September 30, 1910 Werter Genosse, Excuse me for this delay in replying to your two letters.
I returned to Paris only the other day, 209 and was unable to reply earlier.
As regards an article for the C.
O.
on the disarmament resolution of the Copenhagen Congress, it was ordered (back in Copenhagen) and written by another contributor.
Unfortunately, your proposal came too late.
As to inserting your article in the next issue, I must have a talk with Warski and another member of the editorial board.
I shall do this.
Concerning your leading articles in Leipziger Volkszei-tung, I must say that the question is very interesting, but I have not studied it at length, and it seems to me that theoretically you are not quite right.
The criterion of what is “impracticable within the framework of capitalism” should not be taken in the sense that the bourgeoisie will not allow it, that it cannot be achieved, etc.
In that sense, very many demands in our minimum programme are “imprac-ticable”, but are none the less obligatory.
Then, when mentioning the Inaugural Address of the International, you omit from your quotation Marx’s words about the principles of relations between states.
210 Is not that a “minimum programme” in foreign policy? And finally, why do you say nothing about Engels’s “Kann Europa abrüsten?” * ? * “Can Europe Disarm?”—Ed.
You are quite right, in my opinion (all this is my per-sonal opinion, of course), that it is impossible to leave out the demand to arm the people.
Wouldn’t it be more correct to concentrate your fire not on the fact that Abrüstung * is written into the resolution, but that Volkswehr ** is not? I want to reply to Martov and Trotsky in Neue Zeit.
I have already written to Kautsky and asked him whether they would carry it and how long it could be.
It is also neces-sary of course to reply in Leipziger Volkszeitung.

Printed from the originalTO KARL RADEK To Comrade Karl Radek October 9, 1910 Dear Comrade, I intended to reply to the articles by Martov and Trotsky in a long article on the substance of the matter in Neue Zeit.
But things turned out otherwise.
You published a very good statement, while Comrade Karski, even before I had written to Kautsky and Wurm of my intention, had sent Neue Zeit an article against Martov.
211 Wurm sent me Karski’s article, and I agreed that that was enough.
But I cannot, however, leave unanswered Martov and Trotsky’s most incredible absurdities and distortions.
About a third or a half of my article is now ready.
Its subject is: “The Historical Meaning of the Inner-Party Struggle in Russia”.
212 Please give me your advice: is it possible and will it be useful to publish this article in Leipziger Volks-zeitung? If the answer depends on whether or not the editorial board likes my article, I am of course prepared to send it to you without laying down any conditions.
I should be very grateful to you if you could tell me any-thing about this right away.
For instance, I should like to ~now whether you could publish a few feature articles on the subject in Leipziger Volkszeitung.
What is the maximum length of an article to be? And one other thing: I do not write German, but Russian.
Can you have a translation made in Leipzig—or do you find this inconvenient or difficult, and prefer that I should find a translator over here (which ofcourse, in all probability, I can do)? Or, finally, should I write in my very bad German (of which this letter is a spe-cimen), and you can then have my bad German translated into good German in Leipzig? (A friend once told me that it was easier to translate into German from good Russian than from bad German.

PLEKHANOV February 3, 1911 Dear Comrade, I received your letter about Singer today, and passed it on to a comrade who promised to send a telegram (I my-self have a touch of the flu).
By the way, on December 18, I sent you a letter from Huysmans and my draft reply.
213 Your reply seems to be such a long time in arriving! Send me back Huysmans’s letter, at least.
The Duma group informs us that the liquidators made a new attack after Jordansky’s note in No.
4 of Zvezda.
The liquidators were backed by Smirnov, Martov’s brother, Cherevanin and others.
Veselovsky, Chernyshov, Lositsky were against.
Poletayev (who wrote to me about it) says that there is no doubt that they have won, i.
e.
, that the liquidators’ attack has been beaten off.

M.
, How is your health? M.
F.
wrote that you had returned with a cough, etc.
I hope you are better.
We’ve had some bad luck with Mysl.
214 You probably know what has happened from Rech and other papers.
We have to transfer the whole business to St.
Petersburg, and begin all over again.
But we have no legal and reliable people.
Could you help us, if you sympathise with Mysl? Or perhaps Pyatnitsky could help? As things are, we still have enough money to publish such a small journal (pro-vided, of course, that we all work for nothing and pay outsiders 20 rubles a sheet! Not so generous, you see).
So at present it is only technical help that is needed: to find a publisher who, without spending a kopek of his own, would bring out the journal (and we so strongly recognise the strictest legality, that we give the right both to the pub-lisher and to the secretary of the editorial board&a lawyer to hold up anything in the least dangerous; we brought out four issues without the slightest faultfinding from the court.
No.
5 was confiscated on account of Kautsky 215 ! That was obviously a mere pretext.
There was nothing illegal in Kaut-sky).
Why should not Pyatnitsky or someone else help us in such a safe business? If it is impossible to find a publisher, what about a secretary, a legal person whom we would pay 50 rubles a month for worrying about the printing press and forwarding.
All we want is an honest and thoughtful person.
The trouble is that we have no legal people, except work-men (and they won’t do).
The second question.
We have a translation of Kautsky’s latest articles against Maslov, which has already been paid for.
216 It’s quite legal.
It’s an essential thing, because Maslov has written a lot of nonsense and has also lied to his Russian readers.
It’s 3-5 printed sheets.
Could it be published—without author’s fees (for our translation has already been paid for) at cost price? Is Pyatnitsky (or someone else) suitable for anything like this or not? The third question.
Y.
M.
Nakhamkis, deported here from St.
Petersburg for his connections with the Social-Democratic Duma group (he is Nevzorov or Steklov, author of a good book about Chernyshevsky 217 ), is badly in need of work and asks me to inquire whether it would be possible to publish Peary: A Journey to the North Pole.
He thinks it will have a good sale.
What news is there of the “plans”? Please write.
And do reply to the workers at our school.
They are good fellows.
One of them is a poet, and keeps writing verses, but the poor chap has no guide, helper, instructor or ad-viser.

(I have just seen Steklov, who gave me these details.
) Written at the end of April 1 9 1 1 Sent from Paris to Capri First published in 1 9 2 4 in Lenin Miscellany I Printed from the originalTHE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN THE PARTY Our Party has undoubtedly arrived at one of the critical points of its development.
All Bolsheviks must do their utmost to fully clarify their principles, to unite, and once again lead the Party out on to the high road.
The events that have just taken place abroad (June and July 1911) are a sign of crisis in the Party centres.
These events, described and commented upon in a number of leaf-lets of nearly all groups and trends, amount to this, that the liquidators (through the Central Committee Bureau Abroad 218 —C.
C.
B.
A.
) have finally prevented the convoca-tion of a plenum.
The Bolsheviks have broken with this C.
C.
B.
A.
, which has outlawed itself, and jointly with the “conciliators” and the Poles have set up a Technical Com-mission and an Organising Commission219 for the convocation of a conference.
What are the principles involved in these events? The break with the liquidators, who had broken with the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, but continued to obstruct all its work from inside the centres (like the C.
C.
B.
A.
), means the elimina-tion of this obstruction and the possibility of unanimously setting about the restoration of the illegal and really revo-lutionary Social-Democratic Party.
That is the first and main thing.
The second is that the break with the C.
C.
B.
A.
, which had violated all Party laws (and the consequent re-signation from the C.
O.
editorial board of Martov and Dan, who since February 1910 had taken no part in the C.
O.
), means putting right the mistake of the plenum (in January 1910) owing to which it was not the pro-Party Mensheviks but the Golosists 220 (i.
e.
, liquidators) who turned out to be in the central bodies.
The principle laid down by the plenum(cleansing the workers’ party of the bourgeois trends of liquidationism and otzovism 221 ) has now been divested of the liquidationist centres concealing it.
Fortunately, a court of arbitration has now assessed the hypocritical outcries of the Golos people and Trotsky in defence of the C.
C.
B.
A.
Three German Social-Democrats (Mehring, Kautsky and Clara Zetkin) were to decide the question of the Bolshevik funds conditionally handed over to the C.
C.
, and they decided provisionally, pending the conference, to give the money to the Technical Commission and not to the C.
C.
B.
A.
This decision is tantamount to the court of arbitration’s recognition that the C.
C.
B.
A.
was in the wrong.
What is the attitude of the other factions abroad? Trotsky, of course, is solidly behind the liquidators, the Vperyod-ists 222 also (they have not yet said as much in the press, but it is known from their official negotiations with the Organising Commission).
Plekhanov is “on the fence”, while preaching agreement with the C.
C.
B.
A.
(see Plekhanovites’ resolution).
The C.
C.
B.
A.
is itself trying to set about the calling of a conference, with the help of Trotsky, Vperyod and Co.
Whether anything will come of such an “alliance”, no one knows.
A collapse of principle is there inevitable.
Nothing even resembling Party work can result from this bloc.
The “bloc” which is being organised by the former C.
C.
B.
A.
means nothing but intrigue to cover up the anti-Party and anti-Social-Democratic activity of the group of Messrs.
Potresov, Mikhail, Yuri, Roman and Co.
The Bolsheviks’ task now is to unite, beat off the attack of all the enemies of Social-Democracy, give a lead to all who are wavering, and help the illegal R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
to get on its feet.
Some say this is a split.
The hypocrisy of these outcries from the gentry in the C.
C.
B.
A.
has been recognised even by the Germans, who are not familiar with Russian affairs.
Martov’s pamphlet in German, delivered to the holders of the funds, caused Clara Zetkin to make this comment: “A disgusting production.
” In Russia, there is no split among the illegal organisa-tions, there are no parallel Social-Democratic organisations.
There are Party people, and liquidators who have broken away and set up a separate group.
Groups abroad, like those of Golos, Trotsky, the Bund, and Vperyod, want to cover up the break-away of the liquidators, help them to hide un-der the banner of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, and help them to thwart the rebuilding of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
It is our task at all costs to rebuff the liquidators and, despite their opposition, re-create the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
To say that rebuilding and reinforc-ing the illegal party, despite the opposition of the break-away legalists, is “a split” means to make a mockery of the truth and (unconsciously or hypocritically) stretch out a hand to the liquidators.
There are some who say that the Bolsheviks want a faction of their own.
On this point the “conciliators” (in Paris) have now separated into a faction of their own.
Without desiring “factionalism”, they have set up a new faction (with representatives of its own in the Technical Commission and the Organising Commission—and that is the basic symptom of a faction, the “conciliators’” internal discipline among themselves).
How does the question of factionalism stand? In January 1910 the Bolsheviks dissolved their group on condition that all the other factions would also be dissolved.
This condi-tion has not been carried out, as everyone knows.
Golos, Vperyod, and Trotsky and Co.
have intensified their fac-tional activity.
And on December 5, 1910, we Bolsheviks publicly declared that the stipulation had been violated and that our agreement on the dissolution of all factions had been broken, and demanded a return of our group’s funds.
Not only the anti-Party trends, but also the Plekhanovites have remained a separate faction: they have their own organ (Dnevnik), their own platform, their factional nominees to the central bodies, their internal faction discipline.
In these circumstances, the shouts against “factionalism” are so empty, especially when coming from those who have just formed their own faction.
Surely it is time to under-stand that shouts against factionalism are meant to distract attention from the really important question, that of the Party or anti-Party content of the activity of the various factions.
We Bolsheviks set up the T.
C.
and the O.
C.
in a bloc with the factions of the “conciliators” and the Poles.
The Poles are for the “conciliators”; we are in the minority, we are not responsible for the conciliatory errors of the T.
C.
and the O.
C.
The whole history of “conciliationism” (which we shall recount in the press, directly the conciliators force us to do it) is crying evidence of its erroneous nature.
The Bolsheviks must understand this, so as not to repeat these errors.
The “conciliators” have not understood the ideological roots of what keeps us apart from the liquidators, and have therefore left them a number of loopholes and have frequent-ly been (involuntarily) a plaything in the hands of the liquidators.
At the January 1910 plenum, the “conciliators” (together with the Poles) got through an idiotic clause in the resolution: “For the first time”, etc.
(see Lenin’s article in Diskussionny Listok No .
2, 223 or Plekhanov’s Dnevnik, which admitted that the clause was blown up, integralist, i.
e.
, nonsensical).
The conciliators put their trust in the Golos people; in return, Golos publicly disgraced the conciliators with its greasy kisses.
The conciliators put their trust in Trotsky, who has clearly executed a full turn towards the liquidators.
The conciliators in Russia (having had control of the C.
C.
Bu-reau, i.
e.
, all the authority and all the money, for more than a year) haggled with the liquidators, invited them, “awaited” them and, for that reason, have done nothing.
Now, by entering the T.
C.
and the O.
C.
, the conciliators have reached the parting of the ways.
On the one hand, the fact of the break with the C.
C.
B.
A.
is recognition and cor-rection of conciliationist errors.
On the other, the formation of a separate faction against the Bolsheviks, and the alli-ance with the least steady Poles, is a step in continuation of their old errors.
It is our duty to warn all Bolsheviks of this peril, and to call on them to unite all their forces and to fight for the conference.
One and all must be mobilised for this struggle.
The Bolsheviks must win, in order to take the Party on to the high road.
Since the revolution, the Bolsheviks, as a trend, have lived through two errors—(1) otzovism-Vperyodism and (2) conciliationism (wobbling in the direction of the liqui-dators).
It is time to get rid of both.
We Bolsheviks have resolved on no account to repeat (and not to allow a repetition of) the error of conciliationism today.
This would mean slowing down the rebuilding of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
, and entangling it in a new game with the Golos people (or their lackeys, like Trotsky), the Vperyodists and so forth.
But this is a critical time, and there can be no delay.
All Bolsheviks must unite, organise the conference speed-ily and at all costs, win a victory at it or go over to open and straightforward opposition based on principle.
Only Bolshevism, which is alien to waverings either to the left or to the right, can bring the Party out on to the high road.

M.
, It must have been two months ago that I wrote to you last—at the beginning of the school 224 (it is now over, and the students have gone away).
There was no reply, and I was wondering whether the “negotiations” had become protracted or whether anything had radically changed.
Leshchenko was here the other day and told me about Capri, and I was very glad to learn that the whole trouble was the postponement of the meetings you had had in mind until “after the fair”.
225 But the plans at Capri, Leshchenko said, were unchanged: a literary monthly, a full-sized paper and also, I understand, a tabloid.
Yes, all this would be very welcome indeed just now.
The liquidators are buying Kievskaya Kopeika (so they say in St.
Petersburg, whence we had a letter today), and are transferring it to St.
Petersburg.
It would be extremely important to organise a counter-attack.
So far we have been able only to collect our last cash for reviving Zvezda.
I very much count on your help: send us an article.
Help is particularly important at the begin-ning, because it won’t be easy to resume an interrupted publication.
Have you received the pamphlet by Kamenev, and have you read it? I cherish the hope that it must dissipate some of the prejudices you seem to have against its author.
Our Party affairs are in a pretty mess, but still things are coming to a head.
Plekhanov is hedging, he always acts that way—it’s like a disease—before things break.
Martov sent Kautsky and Zetkin the translation (in typescript)of his pamphlet, and this was a great help to us: both Kaut-sky and Clara Zetkin said some pretty harsh things about the pamphlet: the former called it “disgusting”, the latter “dirty”.
Well, all the best.
Do write for Zvezda.

SHKLOVSKY Dear Comrade, I have received your letter and replied by telegram.
To avoid any misunderstandings, here are a few more details.
What I meant was a public lecture (“Stolypin and the Revolution”), with the admission fees to go for the benefit of Rabochaya Gazeta (of course there is no need, or at any rate it’s not obligatory, to say in the advertise-ment for whose benefit it is).
226 The presiding committee (or the chairman) at the meeting must be from among local Bolsheviks, and by no means “elected” (to avoid intrigues and scandals, to which the liquidators are very prone).
I am willing to have a talk with pro-Party people (Ple-khanovites), but not with Golosists.
It would be best of all to confine the audience to Bolsheviks.
I hope to arrive on Thursday; I will send you a telegram about the time of arrival, if I can manage it.
Please be kind enough to send this letter at once to Gorin [M.

227 Written between September 2 6 and 2 8, 1 9 1 1 Sent from Zurich to Berne First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIII Printed from the original190 WHAT IS THE CADET ELECTION PLATFORM? Saturday’s editorial in Rech, September 15, is a virtual exposition of the basic political principles of the Consti-tutional-Democratic Party.
What do these principles of the main party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie amount to now? They amount to three points: (1) “extension of the fran-chise”; (2) “radical reform of the Council of State” 228 ; and, (3) “responsibility of the Ministry to the people’s represen-tatives”.
It goes without saying that to this are added free-dom of association (coalitions) and all the other freedoms, equality of nationalities, “restraint and slowing down” of differentiation in the countryside, and so on and so forth.
Readers should compare these “three points” of the liberals with the “three points” of working-class democrats, who have given an effective reply to the political question, the labour question and the peasant question alike.
The actual source of all the evils and misfortunes, their real “focus”, and the way out are indicated clearly and explicitly by the “three points” of the working-class de-mocrats.
But the liberal platform—for, not nominally but in sub-stance, it is an election platform—of the Cadets is only a wish for modest constitutional reforms.
It differs very little from the wishes of the Octobrists.
The main thing has been obscured; on the main thing the liberal-monarchist bourgeois party has nothing to say.
The Cadets want “to win by modesty”, but then let us re-call that Messrs.
Guchkovs have already tried modesty in practice.
And what was the result? The result was nil! We want very little, the Cadets boast.
But, gentlemen, that “trump” has already been played by the Octobrists.
In all three Dumas, the Cadets and the Octobrists vied with each other in assuring the “government” and the “pub-lic” that they want very little, a modest minimum on the European standard.
The result is nil! No, gentlemen, whether you list constitutional reforms in three points or in twenty, your platform will be a dead one.
You can talk about constitutional reforms, without appearing ridiculous, only where and when the foundations and pillars of political liberty already exist, where and when they are established, assured and stable.
You yourselves know that that is not yet the case in Rus-sia, and therefore your pious wishes do not show the people a way out but mislead them with illusory hopes! Written between September 1 5 and 2 0 (September 2 8 and October 3 ), 1 9 1 2 First published in 1 9 5 4 in the journal Kommunist No.
6 Printed from the originalWORKERS’ UNITY AND THE ELECTIONS The issue of Luch, the liquidators’ newspaper, put out (as a Pravda correspondent rightly points out) on polling day to disrupt unity, is filled to overflowing with talk of “unity” .
The decisive moment in the elections to the workers’ curia 229 in St.
Petersburg Gubernia will arrive in a few days, on Friday, October 5.
On that day, the representatives of the workers will elect 6 electors.
230 It is these elections that are of decisive importance, because unless all the elec-tors are steadfast, consistent working-class democrats and opponents of liquidationism, there will be no serious guaran-tee that the deputy elected to the Duma will be one the majority of class-conscious workers want.
In order not to fail at the crucial moment, one must have a clear understanding of the tasks of working-class demo-crats and the situation in which the representatives are acting.
The essence of the problem today is that under cover of shouts about unity, the liquidators are flouting the will of the majority of class-conscious workers in St.
Petersburg, and are foisting on the majority of the workers the splinter candidates of the minority intelligentsia, namely, the liquidationist intelligentsia.
All elections in a bourgeois country are accompanied by rampant phrase-mongering and licentious promises.
The main principle of Social-Democrats is not to trust words but go to the heart of the matter.
The liquidators’ phrases about unity in their newspaper Luch are a pack of lies.
In reality, unity has already been brought about in St.
Petersburg by the majority of class-conscious workers against the liquidators; it was establishedby the May Day demonstration, and by the support given to Pravda by 550 groups of workers against the 16 groups of liquidators.
Now that is action, not talk.
When 550 groups unite against 16, it is unity.
When 16 foist “their” candidate on 550, it is a split.
The liquidators are carrying out a split, while shouting about unity on the “Stop thief!” principle.
Class-conscious workers should not let themselves be deceived by empty shouts and phrases.
Don’t trust words, take a sober look at the state of affairs.
The vast majority of Marxist workers are opponents of li-quidationism.
An insignificant minority of workers favour the liquidators, and the “strength” of the liquidators lies in the bourgeois intelligentsia, which is in a position to put out a journal, found a newspaper on polling day, get hold of “contacts”, people for intellectuals’ election com-mittees, and so forth.
Every Social-Democrat in St.
Petersburg knows these facts.
This clarifies the significance of the liquidators’ shouts about unity.
Under cover of these shouts, the bourgeois intelligentsia, which sympathises with the liquidators, wants to destroy the unity of the workers by foisting on them the liquidators’ candidate.
That is the heart of the matter.
That is the “crafty design” of the liquidator Luch.
Whoever wants the genuine unity of Marxist workers must help to elect all the anti-liquidator electors.
Whoever wants genuine unity will help to give effect to the will of the majority of the class-conscious workers.
Whoever helps the minority to flout their will is a most malicious disruptor, however loud his shouts of unity! Written not later than September 1 8 (October 1 ), 1 9 1 2 First published in 1 9 5 4 in the journal Kommunist No.

KARPINSKY Dear K.
, I have not been following the recent peace congresses.
I know about the participation of the socialists—and about its opportunist character—but only from hearsay.
231 I will not undertake to express myself definitely on this question before I have read the reports of at least one congress.
The question is a complicated one.
The general growth of opportunism, and the “balancing” of its forces with those of revolutionary Social-Democracy in the big countries of the labour movement (Germany), must surely tell in this sphere too.
Let Bebel play the diplomatist with the opportunists—if this is essential (?)—but it does not befit us to do so.
That’s all I can say just now.
Greetings to Comrade Olga and all our friends, including Gorin.
How is he getting on? What news have you? What are your relations with Plekhanov? Do you have any talks? Kamenev, on his way to Paris, will go to Switzerland to lecture in the autumn (he is now here).
Perhaps I, too, shall manage to come in the winter.
Greetings, Yours, Lenin Written on October 8 , 1 9 1 2 Sent from Cracow to Geneva First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIII Printed from the originalTO THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF P R A V D A Letter to the Editors The undersigned, now in the capacity of a permanent political contributor to Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda, considers it his duty to express his protest against the behaviour of the colleagues in charge of these newspapers at a critical time.
The elections in St.
Petersburg, both in the workers’ curia and in the 2nd urban curia, are a critical moment, a moment for realising the results of five years of work, a moment for determining, in many respects, the direction of work for the next five years.
At such a moment, the leading organ of working-class democrats must follow a clear, firm, and precisely defined policy.
But Pravda, which is in many respects effectively the leading organ, is not conducting such a policy.
Luch and Metallist, 232 with their desperate shouts about “unity”, are carrying on under that “popular” flag the worst policy of the liquidators, namely, insubordination of an insignificant minority to the vast majority of Marxist workers in St.
Petersburg, imposition of the candidate of some three, five or ten tiny groups of intellectuals and a handful of workers on hundreds of consistent working-class democratic groups.
During the few days remaining before the election of workers’ electors, during the few weeks remaining before elections in St.
Petersburg in the 2nd curia, it is Pravda’s undoubted duty to carry on a merciless fight against this deception of the mass of workers, behind the barrage of pious and popular phrases.
Its bounden duty is in themost detailed fashion to explain, demonstrate, chew up for all and sundry, 1st, that liquidationism is a non-Marxist, liberal trend; 2nd, that unity requires the subordination of the minority to the majority, whereas the liquidators are beyond doubt, as the experience of eight months’ work shows, an insignificant minority; 3rd, that those who want to support the working-class democracy must know where the mass of workers stand, and where the philistine intelligentsia, which is playing at Marxism; 4th, that the conference which the liqui-dators and Luch are fussing about has been denounced and exposed both by the neutral Plekhanov (he said straight out that “non-Party and anti-Party elements” took part in their conference) and even by Alexinsky, who is hostile to the anti-liquidators.
And so on, and so forth.
Unless Pravda explains all this in good time, it will be responsible for the confusion and the disruption, since, having the vast majority of the workers behind it and having explained matters in good time, Pravda would most certainly have ensured unity, because the liquidators are past masters at boasting and threats, but would never dare act against Pravda.
Pravda itself has admitted that there are two clearly formalised lines, platforms, collective wills (the August, or liquidators’, line and the January line).
Yet Pravda creates the opinion that it is carrying on some third line “of its own”, invented only yesterday by someone and amounting (as we have learned from St.
Petersburg through other channels, since Pravda’s editorial board has stub-bornly refused to favour us with a reply) either to letting the liquidators have one of the three candidates, or handing over to them the whole of the 2nd curia “in ex-change for the workers’ curia”.
If these rumours are untrue, Pravda bears the entire responsibility for them, because you cannot sow such uncertainty among Marxists that unquestionable friends, Marxists, believe these rumours.
and pass them on.
At this hot time, Nevskaya Zvezda is closed down, with-out a single letter or explanation, collective exchange of opinion is completely interrupted, and political con-tributors are left in the dark, not knowing whom they are helping after all to get elected; may it not be a liquidator? I am obliged hotly to protest against this, and to decline any responsibility for this abnormal situation, which is pregnant with drawn-out conflicts.
Please communicate this letter to the “boss” of Pravda and Nevskaya Zvezda, to the whole editorial board of both papers and all contributors who are consistent working-class democrats.
Greetings, V.

5 Printed from the originalTO THE EDITOR OF P R A V D A Dear Friend, Don’t you find it strange that we have had an active and extremely lively correspondence on one particular theoretical question, one particular book, one particular theory, and that we have never had any correspondence on the vitally urgent questions of that sphere of Russian journalism in which both of us have had to take some considerable part in recent times? I personally find it strange.
I think there can absolutely be no circumstances—and there are none—which could serve as any kind of justification for the absence of such correspondence, since you yourself once pointed out, and quite rightly, that we all feel the harmfulness of detach-ment, isolation, a certain solitude, etc.
I hope, therefore, that I will meet with your support if I start right out with correspondence No.
2 (for No.
1, about the book and the theory, is proceeding on its own and will continue to do so).
You were acquainted, I think, though distantly, with Pokrovsky 2nd? What do you think of the latest explana-tion by the Senate? I mean the one under which the tenant qualification requires actual occupation of the premises? After all, it looks as though this explanation, made just before the elections in the 2nd curia, is specifically aimed at Pokrovsky 2nd, Predkaln, etc.
! Can they have any other qualification in their own localities except that of tenant? And how could they, being members of the Duma, “actually occupy” their apartments in their localities-for, say, a-year? And if they are being “explained”, should not Pok-rovsky 2nd be invited to stand in St.
Petersburg, wherehe probably has a qualification that is much more reliable, i.
e.
, one less subject to “explanation”? I personally would very much sympathise with such a candidature in St.
Peters-burg (alongside the two evidently indisputable candidates who caused the stupid and brazen Luch to come out with its stupid and brazenly cowardly repudiation).
I shall be most grateful if you summon the effort to drop me a line or two (in reply to my 200) on your views of this matter.
Furthermore, I should like to discuss the two workers’ papers at St.
Petersburg.
Luch is base and unprincipled: it’s not a paper, but a “leaflet for subverting” the Social-Democratic candidate.
But they know how to fight, they are lively and glib.
Meanwhile Pravda is carrying on now, at election time, like a sleepy old maid.
Pravda doesn’t know how to fight.
It does not attack, it does not per-secute either the Cadet or the liquidator.
But can an organ of forward-looking democrats not be a fighting organ at a hot time like this? Let’s give it the benefit of the doubt: let’s assume that Pravda is sure that the anti-liquidators will win.
All the same it should fight to let the country know what is involved, who is disrupting the election campaign, and what ideas are at stake in the struggle.
Luch is fighting furiously, hysterically, abandoning its principles in the most shameless fashion.
Pravda—to spite it—puts on a “serious mien”, affects various airs and graces, and fails to fight at all! Does that look like Marxism? After all, didn’t Marx know how to combine war, the most passionate, whole-hearted and merciless war, with complete loyalty to principle? Not to fight at election time is suicide.
Look at what Luch’s “Cadet-eating” has come to! And the Pravda people were afraid that we might be overdoing the Cadet-eating! Best wishes, Yours, V.

5 Printed from the originalTO THE EDITOR OF P R A V D A Dear Friend, We learned only today of the liquidators’ victory in St.
Petersburg.
An analysis of the figures makes it clear that they were got through by non-Social-Democrats, name-ly, the 11 “non-Party” men who voted for the non-Party Stepanov.
But the figures are incomplete.
It is extremely, extremely important to have the complete figures, i.
e.
, (1) the number of votes for and against all 13 candidates; the newspapers give only the figures for 9 candidates (3 liquidators and 6 of ours); those for 3 liquidators and 1 non-Party candidate are missing.
Make every effort to collect these data.
Let several representatives write to the editors of the papers to establish this fact, if the minutes cannot be found.
The importance of these figures is extremely great.
Spare no effort to discover them.
(2) There should be a poll of the representatives on who voted how.
This is of particular importance with respect to “our” 7 Putilov workers&2 of ours from the Semyannikov Works.
Collect the information as speedily, as fully and as precisely as possible.
It is extremely important to learn from the rep-resentatives how the 11 non-Party men voted (apparently they all voted steadily for the liquidators, but it is desirable to collect direct evidence).

236 With Kautsky it turns out to be a pledge against a revolutionary mass strike.
This is inadmissible bath from the Russian standpoint (there are 100,000 political strikers now in St.

Sent from Cracow to San Remo First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIII Printed from the originalAFTER THE ELECTIONS IN AMERICA We have already pointed out in Pravda 237 the great importance of the Republican Party split in America and the formation of Roosevelt’s Progressive Party.
238 Now the elections are over.
The Democrats have won, and at once the consequences predicted by the socialists are beginning to tell.
Roosevelt’s Progressive Party, with its 4.
5 million votes, is a specimen of the broad bourgeois-reformist trend which has come on the scene in sweeping American fashion.
What happens to this trend is of general interest because, in one form or another, it exists in all capitalist countries.
In any bourgeois-reformist trend there are two main streams: the bourgeois bigwigs and politicians, who deceive the masses with promises of reform, and the cheated masses, who feel that they cannot go on living in the old way, and follow the quack with the loudest promises.
And so we find the brand-new Progressive Party in America splitting at the seams right after the elections.
The bourgeois politicians who made use of Roosevelt’s quackery to dupe the masses are already yelling about a merger with the Republican Party.
What’s the idea? It is simply this: the politicians want the cushy jobs which the victorious party in America hands out to its supporters with especial brazenness.
The Republican split gave the victory to the Democrats.
These are now ecstatically sharing out the luscious public pie.
Is it surprising that their rivals are prepared to renounce the Progressive Party and return to the consolidated Republican Party, which has every chance of defeating the Democrats? Indeed, this looks very much like a cynical cheap saleof “party loyalties”.
But we see exactly the same thing in all capitalist countries; and the less freedom there is in a country, the dirtier and fouler is this sale of party loyal-ties among the bourgeois sharks, and the greater is the im-portance of backstairs intrigues and private connections in procuring concessions, subsidies, bonanza legal cases (for the lawyers), etc.
The other wing of any bourgeois-reformist trend—the cheated masses—has now also revealed itself in the highly original, free and lucid American style.
“Scores who had voted for the Progressive Party,” writes Appeal to Reason, 239 the New York workers’ paper, “now come to socialist editorial offices and bureaux for all kinds of information.
They are mostly young people, trusting, inexperienced.
They are the sheep shorn by Roosevelt, without any knowledge of politics or economics.
They instinctively feel that the Socialist Party, with its one million votes, is a more serious proposition than Roosevelt’s 4.
5 million, and what they want to know most is whether the minimum reforms promised by Roosevelt can be implemented.
” “Needless to say,” the paper adds, “we are glad to give every one of these ‘progressives’ any information, and never let any of them leave without socialist literature.
” The lot of capitalism is such that its sharpest operators cannot help “working”—for socialism! Written before November 2 5 (December 8 ), 1 9 1 2 First published in 1 9 5 4 in the journal Kommunist No.

5 Printed from the originalMORE ZEAL THAN SENSE Each has his own preoccupations: the proletariat sees the need for peace, and the capitalists look to the “patri-otic” examples provided by the Balkan War.
To each his own.
The workers insist that in terms of human life a Balkan revolution would have cost a hundred times less than the Balkan War, and would have produced democratic results a thousand times broader and more stable.
The capitalists—both the “Right” and the liberals, all the way up to our Progressists and Cadets—are strain-ing to prove that whereas the banded capitalists in the Balkans have pocketed so much, the banded capitalists of Britain, France and Russia, as an “entente”, could have made off with ever so much more.
One American “patriot”, a patriot of the money-bag, managed to find out that some ships in the Greek navy had been built by Greek millionaire magnates at their own expense.
This American Guchkov or Maklakov hastened to adver-tise and play up the grand patriotic example in every way.
He wrote: “Now if only our country’s shores and all our overseas trade were protected by giant dreadnoughts called Morgan, Astor, Vanderbilt and Rockefeller! With such an example before them, the people would grumble less about the concentration of capital in the hands of billion-aires and about the unequal distribution of wealth!” Patriotic, but impractical, say the American workers laughing.
Gentlemen, go ahead with your splendid scheme, we’re all for it.
Until now, the Rockefellers, Morgans, etc.
, over here in America have been hiring private detach-ments of armed men to protect their property and fightstrikers.
Let the billionaires now give the people a clear picture showing that the “external ” defence of the “state” is defence of the monopolies and the profits of the owners of our trusts! Let’s see what lesson the American workers will learn as they contemplate these super-dreadnoughts named Morgan, Rockefeller, etc.
: will it be patriotic emotion or socialist convictions? Will they become more servile to the capitalists, or will they demand with greater firmness that all trusts (manufacturers’ associations), all the property of the trusts, should be handed over to the workers, to society as a whole? .

The American “patriot” has overdone it.

6 Printed from the originalTHE QUESTION OF PARTY AFFILIATION AMONG DEMOCRATIC-MINDED STUDENTS We noted in Pravda the other day (see No.
) 240 the article by the student M.
which provides remarkably valuable material about “student moods”.
On students’ party affiliation, the writer says: “Of course, a comparatively limited section of the students are members of Left-wing organisations.
In existing conditions, it could not be otherwise, and in general the strength of organisations is deter-mined not by the number of their members, but by their influence on the masses.
It is hard to make a guess about the future, but it should be pointed out that today the Left-wing organisations are marching in step with the mass of the students” (Zaprosy Zhizni 241 No.
47).
The author is quite right when he says that with us in Russia, particularly in the current political conditions, “the strength of organisations is determined not by the number of their members, but by their influence on the masses”.
This would not hold true for Europe; nor would it hold true for Russia in the autumn of 1905; but for present-day Russia it is so true that one might even venture what looks like a paradox: the number of members of an organisation should not exceed a definite minimum, if its influence on the masses is to be broad and stable! But what is the party attitude of these “Left-wing” organisations among the students? Student M.
writes: “It should be particularly noted that one does not feel any dissen-sion among the individual Left-wing organisations.
Such dissension was particularly strong three or so years ago, during the period of lull and inaction.
There were cases when elections to canteen commissions and the like were held according to party lists.
Now these divisions have almost disappeared, partly because everyone has realised the need to join forces for common action, partly because the old partypositions have been unsettled and the new ones have yet to be consolidated.
” There can be no doubt that in this respect, as well, the students provide a reflection of an all-Russia phenomenon.
Everywhere, throughout the democratic movement, and also among the workers, “the old party positions have been unsettled and the new ones have yet to be consoli-dated”.
What is liquidationism? It is either a pusillani-mous concession to the spirit of the times, to the atmosphere of “unsettlement” of the old party positions, or the mali-cious utilisation of this unsettlement by the liberals.
The task of the whole democratic movement is to fight with all its strength against this “unsettlement”, and to achieve a precise, clear, definite, thoughtful “consolida-tion” of the “new positions”.
It would be a great mistake to confuse the arguments and discussions on party (and inner-party) platforms with “dissensions”.
It is absolutely necessary “to join forces for common action”, including, for instance, those of Marxists and Narodniks.
This does not obviate a definite party stand, but, on the contrary, demands it.
It is possible to combine action only when there is real unity of conviction as to whether the particular action is necessary.
That is as clear as daylight.
Russian democracy has been the worse for trying to “join forces” for democratic action with non-democrats, with the liberals! Try and “join the forces” of the supporters, shall we say, of political strikes with the “forces” of their adversaries: there will obviously be harm for the “action”.
Hence, the first thing to do is to achieve a clear, definite, precise, well-thought-out delimitation of “positions”, platforms and programmes—and then to combine the forces that can march together by conviction and social nature; combine them only for the action on which unanimity can be ex-pected.
Then, and only then, will any good come of the undertaking.

SHKLOVSKY Your letter is the first, I believe, to offer a “report” on Basle! 242 It’s rather late.
.
.
.
Evidently something was lacking (or in excess?) at Basle.
.
.
.
I believe that what the delegates lacked was organisation.
And that is ex-tremely sad.
Kamenev, of course, was run off his feet, but what about the other five? Was it really not clear that it was necessary to write to Pravda daily? Was it really so difficult to assign the various duties? We’ve not had a single letter in Pravda from the spot, while the liquidators had several in Luch.
Isn’t it a shame? Of course, so long as we sleep and the liquidators work, they will make more headway.
Is any-thing being done to collect money for Pravda? It doesn’t look like it, while the liquidators have reports in Luch of collections abroad.
Yet Pravda is very, very, very much in need.
Not a single one of the delegates (except Kamenev) has written here about Basle.
It was essential to get organised and write twice a day.
But all kept silent.
Evidently there is some dissatisfaction.
What with? God only knows! I am tremendously satisfied with the results of Basle, because the liquidator idiots let themselves be caught out on the question of the initiating group! 243 You couldn’t have pinned down the riffraff better.
But I’m worried by the inactivity of our delegates, and a sort of “in-the-pouts” behaviour on their part, for no apparent reason.
Did they talk with the German delegates? (After all, 4 or 5 did know German!) Who? With whom? How? What about? There’s not a word, except from Kamenev.
Agitation among the Germans is very important.
You write that “with us things are not too good in the press and in the Duma group”.
They are not too good with Prosveshcheniye.
244 There is no money.
It’s a serious crisis.
It should be given help to enable it to pull through.
Pravda’s circulation is about 23,000.
Luch has 8,000-9,000.
It would be sinful to complain thus far.
But in April and May Pravda had 60,000, and in the summer dropped to 20,000.
It’s rising very slowly.
Without help it won’t pull through.
In the Duma group things are better than ever before.
All the six seats in the workers’ curia are ours.
245 That’s something we’ve never had.
For the first time, we have taken the South.
Six and six out of 12.
Man-kov is a Menshevik.
Rusanov is a question mark.
We can fight.
Here are precise data on our progress.
Deputies in the workers’ curia: II Duma— 12 Mensheviks, 11 Bolsheviks III Duma— 4 ” 4 ” IV Duma— 3 ” 6 ” (=47%) (“Minutes of (=50%) London Congress”, (=67%) p.
451).
246 If you have anyone anywhere who is losing heart, let him think over these figures and be ashamed of his faint-heartedness.
For the first time we have among our people in the Duma an outstanding workers’ leader (Malinovsky).
He will read the declaration.
There’s no comparing him with Alexinsky.
And the results—maybe not at once— will be great.
In the III Duma we started out with 0! In the sphere of illegal work, thanks to the Bureau’s moving here, more has been done than before.
We are moving ahead, even if slowly.
We are publishing illegally more than others.
But we have no money.
If we get help, we shall also publish Rabochaya Gazeta, etc.
Illegal work can be helped from abroad only by visits.
Then help is very important in the form of new connections (1) letters; (2) chance visits; (3) passports; (4) etc.
, etc.
What is being done in this respect is not enough.
Only one per cent is being done in the localities abroad of what could be done.
The most important thing right now is to help Pravda to pull through.
And it is getting poor help.
One man in Vienna (Bukharin) is making an effort.
But nothing is being done in the other cities! No one writes regular reports.
No one makes collections.

IN AMERICA The 32nd Annual Convention of the American Federa-tion of Labour, as the association of trade unions is called, has come to a close in Rochester.
Alongside the rapidly growing Socialist Party, this association is a living relic of the past: of the old craft-union, liberal-bourgeois tra-ditions that hang full weight over America’s working-class aristocracy.
On August 31, 1911, the Federation had 1,841,268 mem-bers.
Samuel Gompers, a strong opponent of socialism, was re-elected President.
But Max Hayes, the socialist workers’ candidate, received 5,074 votes against Gompers’s 11,974, whereas previously Gompers used to be elected unanimously.
The struggle of the socialists against the “trade unionists” in the American trade union movement is slowly but surely leading to the victory of the former over the latter.
Gompers not only fully accepts the bourgeois myth of “harmony between labour and capital”, but carries on a downright bourgeois policy in the Federation against the socialist one, although he professes to stand for the com-plete political “neutrality” of the trade unions! During the recent presidential elections in America, Gompers reprinted in the Federation’s official publication the programmes and platforms of all three bourgeois parties (Democrats, Republicans and Progressists) but did not reprint the programme of the Socialist Party! Protests against this mode of action were voiced at the Rochester Convention even by Gompers’s own followers.
The state of affairs in the American labour movement shows us, as it does in Britain, the remarkably clear-cutdivision between purely trade unionist and socialist striv-ings, the split between bourgeois labour policy and socialist labour policy.
For, strange as it may seem, in capitalist society even the working class can carry on a bourgeois policy, if it forgets about its emancipatory aims, puts up with wage-slavery and confines itself to seeking alliances now with one bourgeois party, now with another, for the sake of imaginary “improvements” in its indentured condition.
The principal historical cause of the particular promi-nence and (temporary) strength of bourgeois labour policy in Britain and America is the long-standing political liberty and the exceptionally favourable conditions, in comparison with other countries, for the deep-going and widespread development of capitalism.
These conditions have tended to produce within the working class an aristocracy that has trailed behind the bourgeoisie, betraying its own class.
In the twentieth century, this peculiar situation in Britain and America is rapidly disappearing.
Other countries are catching up with Anglo-Saxon capitalism, and the mass of workers are learning about socialism at first hand.
The faster the growth of world capitalism, the sooner will socialism triumph in America and Britain.

6 Printed from the originalTHE WORKING CLASS AND ITS “PARLIAMENTARY” REPRESENTATIVES ARTICLE THREE 248 The Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma was the first Social-Democratic parliamentary group in Russia to manage to exist for several years and to stand a long “test” of working jointly with the party of the working class.
For obvious reasons we cannot here tell the story of this work.
We can and must point out only the most im-portant feature: what was the impact of the Party’s develop-ment on the Duma group, and how did relations between the group and the Party change.
First of all, we have to establish the fact that the early steps in the activity of the Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma aroused the strong dissatisfaction and sharp disapproval of the Majority of the Party.
The group was largely dominated by the Mensheviks, who were in opposition to the Party’s 1907 decisions, 249 and the Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma continued or took over this “opposition”.
A kind of struggle began between the Party and the group.
The group’s declaration was attacked—and quite rightly—for its opportunism.
The periodicals which rep-resented the opinion of the Majority of the Party, or of the Party as a whole, repeatedly criticised the group’s opportunist steps, and noted that on a number of questions the group had either failed to set forth the Party’s views in full, or had expressed them wrongly.
A long list of the mistakes and erroneous actions of the Third Duma group subject to correction was officiallyrecognised in December 1908.
250 Naturally, it was clearly stated at the time that the responsibility fell not only on the group, but also on the whole Party, which ought to pay more attention to its Duma group and work more closely with it.
The results of that work are there for all to see.
Between 1908 and 1912, the Right wing of Menshevism in the Party developed into liquidationism.
The four-year struggle of both Bolsheviks and pro-Party Mensheviks 251 against liquidationism cannot be excised from history, however much Luch would like to do so.
During these four years, the Social-Democratic Duma group, from being in opposition to the Party, from being a group criticised by the Party and defended (and some-times directly encouraged in its opportunism) by the Men-sheviks, became an anti-liquidationist group.
The group’s connections with the various newspapers by 1912 have provided documentary evidence of this.
Astra-khantsev and Kuznetsov contributed to the liquidationist Zhivoye Dyelo.
Belousov did too, but he soon left the group altogether, sending it an extremely liquidationist message with sympathetic references to Martov and Nasha Zarya 252 (Mr.
Belousov’s historic message will probably soon appear in the press).
Furthermore, Shurkanov wrote both for the liquidationist and for the anti-liquidationist newspapers.
Gegechkori and Chkheidze wrote for neither.
The other 8 members of the group (Voronin, Voiloshnikov, Yegorov, Zakharov, Pokrovsky, Predkaln, Poletayev and Surkov) contributed to the anti-liquidationist publications.
In 1911-12 Nasha Zarya repeatedly expressed its dis-satisfaction with the Social-Democratic Duma group: the liquidators could not be pleased at the Menshevik group’s siding with the anti-liquidators.
The experience of work in the Black-Hundred Duma, and the experience of struggle against the Right wing of Men-shevism, which has sunk into the swamp of liquidation-ism, all tended to push the Social-Democratic group in the Third Duma to the left, towards the Party, and away from opportunism.
Very many, especially those who find it unpleasant,are wont to forget this remarkable story of the four-year struggle of the Party for a Party attitude in the group (which only means, of course, its ideological orientation, its line).
But the story is a fact.
It should be remembered.
It should be the point of departure in assessing the work of the group in the Fourth Duma.
Of this, more in the next article.

6 Printed from the originalTHE WORKING CLASS AND ITS “PARLIAMENTARY” REPRESENTATIVES ARTICLE FIVE The resolution on the Jagiello issue 253 was the first step of the Social-Democratic group in the Fourth Duma which gave an idea of its composition and direction of activity.
We learn from the newspapers that it was adopted by 7 Menshevik votes against 6 Bolsheviks.
Consequently, it is clear that we have here a decision adopted contrary to the opinion of the majority of the Party, since the 6 work-er deputies from the six chief industrial gubernias represent, as we have seen, the vast majority of the working-class party.
But, perhaps, the content of the resolution shows it to be correct? Let us turn to the content.
Clause 1 refers to “the lack of precise data for establish-ing whether the larger or the smaller part of the Warsaw proletariat gave their votes” for Jagiello as an “elector”.
So, in the opinion of 7 Social-Democratic deputies, the question is not clear.
Yet they speak quite definitely of the Warsaw, and not of the Polish, proletariat, as the liquidators and the Bund do (see Luch and Nasha Zarya).
But we know for sure that the “Warsaw proletariat” “has chosen as electors” two Social-Democrats and one P.
S.
P.
254 man (Jagiello).
Two are a majority as against one.
So that there are very precise data to the effect that Jagiello was voted in by a minority.
What is more, the majority of the worker electors (both Social-Democrats) were against the election of Jagiello,and made a formal declaration to that effect.
The liqui-dators referred to Jagiello’s larger vote, but this does not eliminate the fact that two Social-Democrats and one P.
S.
P.
member were chosen as electors.
In any case, by ignoring in its resolution the protest of the two Social-Democratic electors, who represented all the Polish Social-Democrats in Warsaw, the Seven acted in an anti-Party way, because until now only the Polish Social-Democrats have been affiliated to the Rus-sian Social-Democratic Party.
But the 2nd clause of the resolution is even worse.
The election of Jagiello “by Jewish bourgeois electors”, we are told, “marks the growth of awareness even in bour-geois circles” (!? in Jewish bourgeois circles?) “of the fact that only socialists can be real fighters for the just (?!) interests of oppressed nationalities”.
Everyone knows that the Jewish bourgeois have not shown the least sign of any such “awareness”.
They pre-ferred a Polish bourgeois, but were obliged to elect a social-ist for lack of any other supporter of equality.
It was not “the growth of awareness”, but the growth of difficulties caused by the national struggle among the bourgeois, that has given deputy Jagiello his seat! A worker elector can (and should) utilise the “difficulties” of two thieves who have fallen out to get an honest man into the Duma.
That is unquestionable.
The opposite view held by a section of the Polish Social-Democrats (the so-called chief executive which has lost the chief city, Warsaw) does not hold good.
But when an honest man has entered the Duma because two thieves fell out, it is ridiculous and absurd to say that one of the thieves displayed a “growth of awareness”.
It is this lauding of Jewish bourgeois electors—not at all necessary even to justify Jagiello’s mandate—that proves the opportunism of the seven members of the group, and shows their non-proletarian attitude on the national question.
The Seven in their resolution should have condemned and branded national animosity in general, and the Polish bourgeois for their anti-Semitism in particular—that would have been something.
But to attribute a “growth of aware-ness” to Jewish bourgeois is merely to display one’s own lack of awareness.
Clause 3 undertakes to prove that Jagiello is a Social-Democrat.

bloc.
” But where, in that case, are the Polish Social-Democrats? A bloc without them and against them (the withdrawal of Warsaw’s two Social-Democratic electors) is proof of the anti-Party attitude of the Bund, as was recognised even by the conciliation-minded Plekhanov! In Clause 4 we read: “The P.
S.
P.
is not yet united with the Russian Social-Democratic Party.
” That is a half-truth! Why have the Seven said nothing of the fact that a Party resolution (December 1908) had rejected unity with the P.
S.
P.
? Was it only to please those who would liqui-date the Party? The conclusion from the whole of this lame and miserable resolution is separation of “questions of the internal life of the Russian Social-Democratic Party” from “questions of political activity in the Duma”.
This is a thoroughly bad separation.
Party people cannot separate these ques-tions.
To separate them is to separate the Duma group from the Party.
It is the worst kind of opportunism and the introduction of great confusion.
Tactics are determined by the Party’s “internal” decisions.
Is it these tactics or some other, “non-Party”, tactics that should be applied in “political activity in the Duma”? A candidate of the Bund, which wants to be considered a section of the Social-Democratic Party, is deprived of a decisive vote on “questions of the internal life of the Social-Democratic Party”.
This is the only positive point in the muddled resolution of the seven deputies, who have been confused by the liquidators.
Class-conscious workers should do their utmost to help them sort things out, to explain to them the mistake they * The sentence is crossed out in the MS.

A mis-take at the outset is not so terrible in itself—this was rightly pointed out by K.

6 Printed from the original1913 EUG ä NE POTTIER THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH In November of last year—1912—it was twenty-five years since the death of the French worker-poet, Eugène Pottier, author of the famous proletarian song, the Inter-nationale (“Arise ye starvelings from your slumbers”, etc.
).
This song has been translated into all European and other languages.
In whatever country a class-conscious worker finds himself, wherever fate may cast him, however much he may feel himself a stranger, without language, without friends, far from his native country—he can find himself comrades and friends by the familiar refrain of the Internationale.
The workers of all countries have adopted the song of their foremost fighter, the proletarian poet, and have made it the world-wide song of the proletariat.
And so the workers of all countries now honour the memory of Eugène Pottier.
His wife and daughter are still alive and living in poverty, as the author of the Inter-nationale lived all his life.
He was born in Paris on Octo-ber 4, 1816.
He was 14 when he composed his first song, and it was called: Long Live Liberty! In 1848 he was a fighter on the barricades in the workers’ great battle against the bourgeoisie.
Pottier was born into a poor family, and all his life remained a poor man, a proletarian, earning his bread as a packer and later by tracing patterns on fabrics.
From 1840 onwards, he responded to all great events in the life of France with militant songs, awakening the consciousness of the backward, calling on the workers tounite, castigating the bourgeoisie and the bourgeois govern-ments of France.
In the days of the great Paris Commune (1871), Pottier was elected a member.
Of the 3,600 votes cast, he received 3,352.
He took part in all the activities of the Commune, that first proletarian government.
The fall of the Commune forced Pottier to flee to England, and then to America.
His famous song, the Internationale, was written in July 187 1—you might say, the day after the bloody defeat in May.
The Commune was crushed—but Pottier’s Internationale spread its ideas throughout the world, and it is now more alive than ever before.
In 1876, in exile, Pottier wrote a poem, The Workingmen of America to the Workingmen of France.
In it he described the life of workers under the yoke of capitalism, their poverty, their back-breaking toil, their exploitation, and their firm confidence in the coming victory of their cause.
It was only nine years after the Commune that Pottier returned to France, where he at once joined the Workers’ Party.
The first volume of his verse was published in 1884, the second volume, entitled Revolutionary Songs, came out in 1887.
A number of other songs by the worker-poet were published after his death.
On November 8, 1887, the workers of Paris carried the remains of Eugène Pottier to the Père Lachaise cemetery, where the executed Communards are buried.
The police savagely attacked the crowd in an effort to snatch the red banner.
A vast crowd took part in the civic funeral.
On all sides there were shouts of “Long live Pottier!” Pottier died in poverty.
But he left a memorial which is truly more enduring than the handiwork of man.
He was one of the greatest propagandists by song.
When he was composing his first song, the number of worker socialists ran to tens, at most.
Eugène Pottier’s historic song is now known to tens of millions of proletarians.

Printed from the Pravda textTHE DEVELOPMENT OF WORKERS’ CHOIRS IN GERMANY The workers’ choral societies of Germany recently celebrated a kind of jubilee: the number of worker-singers reached 100,000, with a total membership of 165,000 in these societies.
The number of women workers in them is 11,000.
The workers’ choirs have their own periodical, Arbei-ter-Sänger Zeitung, which began to appear regularly only in 1907.
The beginnings of the workers’ choral societies date back to the 1860s.
A choral section was founded in the Leipzig Artisans’ Educational Society, and one of its members was August Bebel.
Ferdinand Lassalle attached great importance to the organising of workers’ choirs.
At his insistence, members of the General Association of German Workers 256 founded, at Frankfurt am Main in 1863, a workers’ society called the Choral Union.
This Union held its meetings in the dark and smoky back room of a Frankfurt tavern.
The room was lit with tallow candles.
There were 12 members of the Union.
Once, when Lassalle, on one of his speaking tours, stayed overnight at Frankfurt, these 12 worker-singers sang him a song by the well-known poet Herwegh, whom Lassalle had long been urging to write the words for a workers’ chorus.
In 1892, after the repeal of the Anti-Socialist Law, 257 there were 180 workers’ choral societies in Germany with 4,300 members.
In 1901, the membership reached 39,717, in 1907, 93,000, and by 1912, 165,000.
Berlin is said to have 5,352 members of workers’ choral societies; Hamburg, 1,628; Leipzig, 4,051; Dresden, 4,700, etc.
We recently reported how the workers of France and other Romance countries had marked the 25th anniversary of the death of Eugène Pottier (1816-1887), the author of the famous Internationale.
* In Germany, the propaganda of socialism by workers’ songs is much more recent, and the “Junker” (landowners’, Black-Hundred) government of Germany has been throwing up many more foul police obstacles to such propaganda.
But no amount of police harassment can prevent the singing of the hearty proletarian song about mankind’s coming emancipation from wage-slavery in all the great cities of the world, in all the factory neighbourhoods, and more and more frequently in the huts of village labourers.

With all respect, Lenin Sent from Cracow to Clarens (Switzerland) First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIII Printed from the originalTHE INTERNATIONAL POLICY OF THE BOURGEOISIE Government newspapers and liberal newspapers are full of news, rumours, speculations and calculations about “Balkan” policy.
What a mess! Sensation follows upon sensation, each report is more spectacular than the last.
Yesterday, it was said that war was about to break out between Austria and Montenegro, between Bulgaria and Serbia.
Today there is a spate of denials of yesterday’s news, and assur-ances that “peace has been secured”.
Yesterday there were piquant stories about Essad pasha, his secret treaty with the King of Montenegro, and his insidious plans for seizing power in Albania.
Today comes denial of these stories, and more piquant reports about agreements between Austria and Essad.
The man in the street, swallowing everything he is told, listens to these fables, taking them at their face value, and blindly following the swindlers who try to divert “public” attention with exactly the kind of thing that serves their interest.
The man in the street does not suspect that he is being led by the nose, and that the ringing phrases about “patriotism”, “the country’s honour and prestige” and “the Concert of Great Powers” are a deliberate attempt to cover up the machinations of financial swindlers and all sorts of capitalist adventurers.
The sensational reports cooked up daily by the big bourgeois newspapers, whose occupation it is to sell the “latest” and the “most exciting” news at a profit, are designed specifically to distract the attention of the crowd from the really important questions and the real background of “high” politics.
The conservative newspapers in Europe, the Black-Hundred 259 and Octobrist, and also non-party, papers in our own country, are playing this game crudely and in primitive fashion.
In Russia, for example, they carry daily incitements against Austria, and depict Russia as the “pro-tector” of the Slavs.
The liberal press, like Rech and similar other papers, is carrying on the very same game, only in more subtle fashion, concealing it more skilfully, making its “digs” at Austria with greater caution, assuming the air of statesmen discussing the issues confronting the Concert of Europe.
In reality, all this quarrelling between Austria and Russia, between the Triple Alliance and the Triple En-tente, 260 all these subtle approaches, are nothing but disputes between capitalist profiteers and capitalist govern-ments over the division of the spoils.
They are trying to drag the man in the street into the issue of how “we” can tear off a bigger slice, and how to let “them” have a smaller one; they are trying to get the man in the street to take an interest and show concern in the squabbling.
Nothing is being written or said about the number of skins to be taken off the backs of the peasant and the worker in Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece to cover the expenses of war, or in Austria to cover the expenses of mobilisation, or in Russia for the same purpose and for her imperialist policy; or whether, and how, democratic institutions are to be ensured in the “new” states of the Balkans, or in Armenia, or in Mongolia.
That is not news.
The profits of the international sharks do not depend on that.
Demo-cratic institutions even tend to hamper “steady” profit-making.
Instead of exposing the policy of the Great Powers, the newspapers—both conservative and liberal—are engaged in discussing how best to help the sharks have their fill through this policy.

1 0 1 Printed from the Pravda textCAPITALISM AND FEMALE LABOUR Present-day capitalist society conceals within itself numerous cases of poverty and oppression which do not immediately strike the eye.
At the best of times, the scat-tered families of poor townspeople, artisans, workers, employees and petty officials live in incredible difficul-ties, barely managing to make both ends meet.
Millions upon millions of women in such families live (or, rather, exist) as “domestic slaves”, striving to feed and clothe their family on pennies, at the cost of desperate daily effort and “saving ” on everything—except their own labour.
It is these women that the capitalists most willingly employ as home-workers, who are prepared for a mon-strously low wage to “earn a little extra” for themselves and their family, for the sake of a crust of bread.
It is from among these women, too, that the capitalists of all coun-tries recruit for themselves (like the ancient slave-owners and the medieval feudal lords) any number of concubines at a most “reasonable” price.
And no amount of “moral indignation” (hypocritical in 99 cases out of 100) about prostitution can do anything against this trade in female flesh; so long as wage-slavery exists, inevitably prosti-tution too will exist.
All the oppressed and exploited classes throughout the history of human societies have always been forced (and it is in this that their exploi-tation consists) to give up to their oppressors, first, their unpaid labour and, second, their women as concubines for the “masters”.
Slavery, feudalism and capitalism are identical in this respect.
It is only the form of exploitation that changes; the exploitation itself remains.
An exhibition of the work of “women exploited at home” has opened in Paris, the “capital of the world”, and the centre of civilisation.
Each exhibit has a little tag showing how much the woman working at home receives for making it, and how much she can make per day and per hour on this basis.
And what do we find? Not on a single article can a woman working at home earn more than 1.
25 francs, i.
e.
, 50 kopeks, whereas the earnings on the vast majority of jobs are very much smaller.
Take lampshades.
The pay is 4 kopeks per dozen.
Or paper bags: 15 kopeks per thousand, with earnings at six kopeks an hour.
Here are little toys with ribbons, etc.
: 2.
5 kopeks an hour.
Artificial flowers: two or three kopeks an hour.
Ladies’ and gentlemen’s underwear: from two to six kopeks an hour.
And so on, without end.
Our workers’ associations and trade unions, too, ought to organise an “exhibition” of this kind.
It will not yield the colossal profits brought in by the exhibitions of the bourgeoisie.
A display of proletarian women’s poverty and indigence will bring a different benefit: it will help wage-slaves, both men and women, to understand their condition, look back over their “life”, ponder the condi-tions for emancipation from this perpetual yoke of want, poverty, prostitution and every kind of outrage against the have-nots.

1 0 2 Printed from the Pravda textLANDOWNERS’ CALL FOR “PACIFYING” THE COUNTRYSIDE If the newspaper Novoye Vremya is quite deservedly “famed” for being one of the most dishonest newspapers, which adapts itself to profitable business interests, to the government, and to the ruling class of landowners, its correspondent Menshikov is doubly famed, and with even better reason.
Menshikov’s articles frequently allow readers to make a sure guess as to which “ circles” in official, capitalist, or aristocratic St.
Petersburg had ordered this or that statement by him.
Not very long ago, this Menshikov was ordered an article in defence of the “aristocratic” Council of State against the plans for its supposedly democratic reform.
The article had clearly been ordered by high-ranking official landowner circles.
All the more instructive is it then to hear what the landowners have to say about the notorious “pacification” of the countryside.
“I have fairly frequent calls from provincials visiting St.
Petersburg, landowners and public men,” says Menshi-kov.
Whether the landowners call on him, or whether he calls at the front halls of distinguished landowners, is another matter.
In any case he sings to the landowners’ tune, and his article has value only in that it gives one an idea of what the landowners frankly say.
“If they are to be believed—and why shouldn’t they be believed,” the landowners’ mouthpiece goes on, “the Pugachov movement 261 of 1905-06 has not at all ended.
It has subsided, it has assumed other, less boisterous forms, but it continues its work of destruction.
True, the peasants no longer march, as they used to do, in great crowds, with caravans of horse-drawn carts, to plunder and burn the coun-try estates of the landowners.
But arson continues all thesame without cease: now it’s a house they set on fire, now a threshing shed, now a hayloft, now a barn, now a stack of corn or straw.
The most outrageous, the most stupid illegal cattle-grazing continues.
.
.
.
During the seven years of our parliamentary era, no headway at all has been made in the fight against village anarchy.
” Thus writes Menshikov in Novoye Vremya.
The order evidently was to prepare “public opinion” for fresh meas-ures of persecution and punishment of “hooligans”, to use the expression current in the Black-Hundred and Octobrist camp.
But, in carrying out his orders, the landowners’ lackey blurts out the landowners’ true state of mind and the true causes of their alarm.
Let us note and remember that the landowning gentry intend to have new punitive laws and regulations to fight the “Pugachov movement” of 1905-06, which has not at all ended, but has assumed new forms.
Only one thing is somewhat strange.
In 1905 and 1906, the government and the Council of the United Nobility 262 assured themselves and others that the “Pugachov move-ment” was the result of communal landownership and the embryonic state of the institution of private property in land among the peasantry.
Now all the agents of the government, all the government parties and newspapers are dinning into our ears that the village commune has collapsed and has been destroyed, and that the new system of land tenure and the establishment of private property in land among the peasantry have been a “tremendous ” success.
If that were so, the “Pugachov movement” al-legedly caused by the village commune should surely have stopped! And if it “has not at all ended”, as the landowners assure us through Menshikov, their mouthpiece, it follows that the village commune has nothing to do with it.
Consequently, the famous successes of the “new system of land tenure ” are a myth.
At any rate, the policy of which the landowners have been boasting is a patent flop.

Printed from the Pravda textLESSONS OF THE BELGIAN STRIKE The general strike of the Belgian workers has ended, as readers will know, in a half-victory.
263 So far the workers have secured only a promise by the clerical government to appoint a commission to examine the question, not only of the local but also of the national franchise.
The other day, the Belgian Prime Minister promised in the Chamber of Deputies that the commission would be ap-pointed in May.
Of course, a ministerial promise (like any other promise “from above”) is something that can by no means be taken seriously.
One could not even speak of a partial victory, if the general political situation did not bear witness to a certain breach made by the general strike in the old, die-hard, unyielding and stubborn clerical (i.
e.
, reaction-ary and obscurantist) “order”.
The achievement of the strike is not so much this frag-ment of a victory over the government as the success of the organisation, discipline, fighting spirit and enthu-siasm for the struggle displayed by the mass of the Belgian working class.
The working class of Belgium has proved that it is capable of steadfast struggle at the call of its Socialist Party.
“We shall repeat the strike once again, if necessary!” This was said by a workers’ leader during the strike and is an expression of the fact that the masses are aware of holding their weapons firmly in their hands, and of being ready to make use of them once again.
The strike proved to the Belgian capitalists that it inflicts vast losses on them, and that concessions are essential, if Belgian capital is not to fall hopelessly behind German capital, etc.
In Belgium, stable constitutional practices have long since been established, and political liberty is an old achievement of the people.
Given political liberty, the workers have a broad and open road before them.
Why, in that case, has the strike had such little success? There are two main reasons.
The first is the domination of opportunism and reform-ism in a section of the Belgian Socialists, especially those in parliament.
Being accustomed to move in alliance with the Liberals, these members of parliament feel themselves dependent on the Liberals in all their activity.
As a result, there was hesitation in calling the strike, and hesitation could not but limit the success, strength and scope of the whole proletarian struggle.
The first lesson of the Belgian strike is: look less to the Liberals, trust them less, and have more confidence in the independent and whole-hearted struggle of the prole-tariat.
The second cause of its partial failure is the weakness of the workers’ organisations and the weakness of the party in Belgium.
The Workers’ Party in Belgium is an alliance of politically organised workers with politically unorganised workers, “pure and simple” co-operators, trade unionists, etc.
This is a big drawback of Belgium’s labour movement, which Mr.
Yegorov in Kievskaya Mysl and the liquidators in Luch have done wrong to ignore.
The second lesson of the Belgian strike is: pay more atten-tion to socialist propaganda, work more to build up a strong, highly principled and strictly party organisation which is true to socialism.

Printed from the Pravda textTHE BUILDING INDUSTRY AND BUILDING WORKERS Russia’s industrial boom over the last few years has been accompanied by the usual rapid development of the building industry.
Vestnik Finansov 264 recently carried out a poll among the municipal authorities in 158 towns of Russia on this question.

15,093 .
16,674 In some three years, the building industry has expanded nearly 50 per cent! That the capitalists are making vast profits on this industrial boom can be seen from the prices of bricks.
The prices reach 33 rubles per thousand in St.
Petersburg, and 36 rubles in the more industrialised Moscow.
Municipal brickworks exist in only 50 or 60 towns, so that the possibility of combating the insatiable appetites of the building capitalists is insignificant.
And, for that matter, our towns, as a result of the property franchise, the complete absence of free elections, etc.
, have been completely handed over to a handful of money-bags, who take municipal interests to be those of their own pockets.
The series of notorious collapses of houses under con-struction shows the incredibly scandalous practices in building, the carelessness and the total disregard for hu-man life.
Intensified building activity, with thousands and thousands of rubles passing into the pockets of con-tractors, engineers, capitalists, and the mass of sacrifices offered up by the workers on the altar of capital—that is what the industrial “boom” means.
And what of the position of the hundreds of thousands of building workers? We learn the following about their wages from the poll.
The day’s wage of a building worker varies with the size of the town as follows: Population Under 5,000 .
5,000 -10,000 .
10,000 -25,000 .
25,000 -50,000 .

One can imagine what these workers suffer with the present high cost of living, when very often they have to maintain a family in another town or in the country.
Moreover, building work is seasonal, it does not continue the year round.
During the few months of employment, the worker must earn enough to maintain him-self and his family throughout the year.
These figures are evidence of the workers’ poverty and utter insecurity.
It is more difficult for building workers to unite and get organised than for workers in factories.
All the more insistently should workers in the van campaign for the education and organisation of building workers, who can seek help nowhere but from their own workers’ paper, their own workers’ trade union, and their own more developed proletarian comrades.

Printed from the Pravda textAN ASSESSMENT OF THE FOURTH DUMA What the Social-Democrats, representing the working class, think of the Fourth Duma is well known.
Their assessment is based on the class character of the landowner and landowner-bourgeois Duma, and also on the character of the government which is trying to make some kind of deal with the ruling classes in this Duma.
But it is instructive also to look at how this Duma is assessed by the Right itself, and particularly by the landowners.
In this respect, it is interesting to read an interview carried by southern papers with Mr.
Sinadino, mayor of Kishinev, and a landowner who was a Nationalist in the Third Duma, and in the Fourth is considered a member of the “Centre” party, that is, to the right of the Octobrists.
There seems to be no point in looking around for a more reliable pillar of the Establishment! And here is his assessment: “The Fourth Duma is a mere fiction .
The men on the Council of State have no consideration at all for the representatives of the people, and act, we should say, against their will .
I repeat, the Duma is a mere fiction, and in such conditions can give the country nothing .
I can find no expression in Russian to describe the activities of the Council of State .
It is what the French call ‘sabotage’ .
.
.
.
” This offended landowner is telling such truths about the Duma and about our government that the workers ought to look at them closely.
In general, as readers know, the democrats have a chance to hear a truthful opinion about the system and “order” of dominant reaction from the reactionary gentlemen only when these reactionaries fall out.
One landowner (or several landowners) feels offended—and you get such a description of the landowners’ “system” of state administration and state structure that you might think the description had been taken from a Social-Democratic leaflet! Both the Fourth and the Third Duma, Mr.
Offended Right-wing Landowner, are not fictions, because they provide the government, for example, with approval for its budget.
But the point is that in spite of the whole landowning class and all the top bourgeoisie helping the government, it is not able to make any headway! The possibility for an alliance between the government and the landowners and the bourgeoisie has been created.
The Duma is doing all it can to bring about such an al-liance.
And yet nothing even remotely resembling a con-stitution has been produced.
The old state system is still there.
The Ministers likewise are people who “tremble” (to use Sinadino’s words) “for their own future”, evidently not knowing what will happen to them tomorrow, what their orders will be tomorrow.
All the “activity” of the Duma with the Council of State, all the liberal wailing about the hopelessness of reforms, even the most modest, the most Octobrist, the most insignificant—and, finally, the frank admissions of the offended landowner-“legislator”—all show that con-stitutional illusions and reformist aspirations in present-day Russia are quite groundless.

Associa-tions of capitalists are steadily raising prices, raking in millions and tens of millions, while the mass of the peasantry fall into greater and greater ruin and workers’ families find it ever more difficult to make both ends meet, and have to go hungry and deny themselves the barest necessities.

2,729 In the last six years, prices have risen from 2,195 to 2,729, i.
e.
, by fully 24 per cent! There is remarkable “progress” in the fleecing of the mass of the working people, and particularly of the workers, by the capitalist combines.
But the capitalists—both in the journal quoted and in their innumerable societies and associations, graciously authorised by the government—continue to complain of the “unfair” taxation of trade and industry!This would be funny, only the workers are not inclined to laugh.
The poor and unfortunate industrial millionaires pub-lish the following data given in a ministerial document on the taxation of urban real estate.
In 1910, the income from such property was assessed at 239 million rubles (of course, it was assessed bureau-cratically, by officials, and one can imagine how many tens of millions were concealed by the oh-so-poor merchant class).
In 1912, i.
e.
, only two years later, the income on urban real estate was assessed at 500 million rubles (count-ing only Russia, without the Kingdom of Poland).
And so, in two years, the net income on urban real estate rose by more than 250 million rubles! This gives an idea of the stream of gold pouring into the pockets of the capi-talists, coming in millions of trickles from incredible want, poverty and hunger among the peasants and workers.
“The high cost of living today ” is nothing but the present-day (capitalist) form of impoverishment, ruin and plunder of the working people alongside the unprecedented enrich-ment of a handful of capitalists.
Pity the poor capitalists who complain of patently “unfair” taxation.
Just think: they have to give up 6 per cent of their net income.
In 1910, they had to give up (in Russia without Poland) 14 million rubles, and in 1912, 29.
8 million rubles.
And so in two years the increase in tax on the robbed millionaires amounted to nearly 16 million rubles.
What do you think, worker comrades: when net income goes up from 240 to 500 millions, i.
e.
, by 60 million rubles in two years, should not a tax of a hundred or two hundred million rubles have been collected? Should they not have taken from the additional profit of 260 million rubles, made on the workers and poor peasants, two hundred mil-lions, at a modest valuation, for schools and hospitals, to aid the hungry and provide for workers’ insurance?

1 1 6 Printed from the Pravda textTHE GERMAN SOCIAL-DEMOCRATS AND ARMAMENTS The Budget Commission of the German Reichstag has passed the first reading of the Arms Bill.
There is no doubt that its adoption is assured.
The government of the Jun-kers—those brothers of our Purishkevich and Markov—is “working” hand in hand with the German bourgeoisie on new methods of oppressing the people, while increasing the profits of the capitalist manufacturers of the weapons of destruction.
The manufacturers of war supplies and equipment are doing good business.
The young hopefuls of the Prussian nobility are anticipating the pleasure of getting “additional” appointments as officers.
All the ruling classes are satisfied—and what are modern parliaments but instruments for doing the will of the ruling classes.
In order to justify the new armaments, there are the usual efforts to paint a picture of the perils threatening the “fatherland”.
To scare the German philistine, the German Chancellor has raised, among other things, the bogey of the Slav peril.
The Balkan victories, you see, have strengthened “Slavdom”, which is hostile to the whole “German world”! Pan-Slavism, the idea of uniting all the Slavs against the Germans there lies the peril, the Junkers’ Chancellor assures them.
The German Social-Democrats have exposed, and continue steadfastly to expose in their press, their parliamentary speeches and at meetings, these hypocritical, chauvinist outbursts.
There is a state, the Social-Democrats have said, the majority of whose population is Slav and which has long enjoyed political liberty and constitutional order.
It is Austria.
It is quite absurd to fear military designs on the part of that state.
Pinned down by the Social-Democrats, the German Chancellor referred to the noisy Pan-Slavist manifesta-tions in St.
Petersburg.
That’s a wonderful argument! The manufacturers of guns, armour, gunpowder and other “cultural” requirements wish to enrich themselves both in Germany and in Russia, and in order to fool the public each refers to the other.
Russian chauvinists are being used to scare the Germans, and German chauvinists, the Russians! Both play a miserable role in the hands of the capitalists, who know perfectly well that the very idea of a war by Russia against Germany is ridiculous.
We repeat that the German chauvinists are assured of a majority vote in the Reichstag.
But among the German workers there is growing indignation and demand for more than purely parliamentary means of struggle against the shameless plundering of the people’s money by the chau-vinists.
It is interesting to note that a general meeting of the Social-Democrats of the 1st Württemberg constit-uency (Stuttgart) adopted the following resolution: “This general meeting expresses its regret at the fact that the strug-gle against the Arms Bill in parliament is not being waged with suf-ficient vigour.
The meeting considers that the furious drive into the people’s pocket by the arms manufacturers should be resisted by all possible means.
This meeting, therefore, expects the Social-Demo-cratic group in the Reichstag to take up the struggle when the Bill comes out of committee for discussion by the Reichstag as a whole, in the most energetic fashion, without hesitating to adopt even obstruc-tionist tactics.
The meeting considers insufficient the extraparlia-mentary struggle the Party has carried on until now.
This meeting demands that the Party executive should begin organising action to involve the whole working population, including mass strikes.
” There is slow but steady growth of awareness among German Social-Democrats that more resolute, active, mass struggle by the workers is necessary.
If the opportunists, of whom there are many in the parliamentary group and among the officials of the labour movement, are opposed to such a struggle, the masses of workers accept it with greater and greater sympathy.

1 1 6 Printed from the Pravda textORGANISATION OF THE MASSES BY THE GERMAN CATHOLICS In backward states, where the mass of the people have no rights, where there is no political liberty, where the authorities have arbitrary powers, political organisations on any broad scale are non-existent.
Only tiny groups of landowners or millionaire industrialists enjoy “the right of association”; but they turn all their attention to high quarters, to “the spheres”, to the authorities, and not only shun but dread any massive organisation of the people.
In states with assured constitutional foundations and the people’s right to take part in government, it is not only the socialists who strive to organise the masses (their only strength lies in educating and organising the masses), but also the reactionary parties.
If the state system has been made democratic, the capitalists must seek support among the masses, and for this the latter must be organised around the watchwords of clericalism (Black-Hundredism and religion), of nationalism and chauvinism, etc.
Political liberty does not eliminate the class struggle but, on the contrary, makes it broader and more conscious, drawing into it the most backward sections of the people, and teaching them politics and defence of their views and interests.
It is instructive to see how, for example, the German reactionary party of the “Centre”, i.
e.
, the Catholics, organises masses of the people.
They strive to get the masses to defend capitalism around the watchwords of religion and “patriotism”.
And the Catholics in Germany have succeeded in playing up the people’s prejudices and igno-rance, partly owing to the fact that the Catholics in Ger-many are a minority of the population, which at one time was subjected to persecution by the state.
And the masses of toilers and exploited always instinctively tend to sympathise with those who are persecuted.
The Catholic reactionaries have made skilful use of this sentiment.
The Catholics have created a mass organisation, the so-called People’s Union for Catholic Germany.
The Union has three-quarters of a million members.
The organisation is strictly centralised.
Its aim is to safeguard the “chris-tian” (in practice, capitalist) system, and fight “destruc-tive” (i.
e.
, socialist) tendencies.
The Union is headed by a 24-man board.
Of them, 9 handle the board’s business correspondence, and the rest are representatives of different regions, large cities, etc.
There is one “agent” for every 20-40 Catholic families.
All the agents act on instructions from the board.
The Catholics, when attacking the Social-Democrats, usually accuse the Social-Democratic agitators of living on the workers’ coppers.
But in their own organisation the Catholics themselves act in precisely the same way: in every place of any importance they have paid agitators.
Work at the party executive is organised on strictly factory lines.
Twenty special officials are in charge of “literature”: one handles theology, another, the agrarian question, a third, the Social-Democratic movement, a fourth, the artisans, etc.
They make cuttings and extracts from news-papers and journals, and keep a card index.
They have a staff of stenographers.
A special library has 40,000 volumes.
They draw up letters to the press—“reports”— which are published by dozens of Catholic papers.
Special branches of this correspondence deal with “social and political questions” and “apologetics” (i.
e.
, defence of religion and Christianity).
Series of booklets are published on all questions.
As many as 5,000 sets of speakers’ notes on various subjects are sent out every year.
A special department deals with propaganda by films.
An infor-mation bureau answers queries of every kind free of charge: in 1912 it answered over 18,000,000.
Catholic students are regularly recruited for propa-ganda and agitation, particularly during vacations.
Theagents (of whom there are several tens of thousands) attend special “social courses”.
There are special two-month courses at the party executive for “training” to fight the Social-Democrats.
There are special fortnightly courses for peasants, teachers, shop assistants, etc.
The reactionary German Catholics are rather well organ-ised.
But all their work is a feeble imitation of the work of the German Social-Democrats.

1 2 0 Printed from the Pravda textHOLIDAYS FOR WORKERS The metalworkers in Germany, as in other countries, are in the van of class-conscious and organised proletarians.
They have raised the question, among other things, of regular annual holidays for workers.
The manufacturers resist this measure with all their strength, pleading the “heavy burden” of the cost involved.
But the German metalworkers, in a special pamphlet pub-lished by their union, have given exact figures to refute these selfish and hypocritical evasions.
The workers have proved that between 1905 and 1910 the net profit in 93 joint-stock companies in the German metallurgical industry averaged 13.
4 per cent! It would be sufficient to reduce this profit by no more than 2 per cent to give all workers regular holidays.
But at the present time the system of holidays is still quite inadequately developed, and for the most part is being applied by the capitalists to further indenture the workers.
The German metalworkers have taken two polls on the question of holidays, in 1908 and 1912.
In 1908, workers had holidays at 138 factories.
Of the 75,591 workers engaged in these factories, 13,579, i.
e.
, 17.
9 per cent, had holidays.
In 1912, workers had holidays at 389 factories.
Of the 233,927 workers employed there, 34,257, i.
e.
, 14 per cent, had holidays.
In all, only three factories in a thousand in the metallur-gical industry had a system of holidays! Of the total num-ber of metalworkers only 1.
8 per cent, i.
e.
, less than one-fiftieth, had holidays.
Most factories allowing holidays—namely, more than nine-tenths of them—grant holidays only to workers who have been employed a fairly long time at the works.
Of the 389 factories (with 233,927 workers), 84 factories em-ploying 140,209 workers require a length of service from five to ten years (!) before a worker gets the right to a holiday.
Such holidays are obviously a ridiculously small im-provement for the workers, and are mainly a bait to keep the workers in the factory and a means of combating strikes! In most cases (for 72 per cent of the workers in the factories mentioned) the length of the holiday does not exceed one week.
For 10 per cent, the period is less than a week, and only for 16 per cent is it more than a week (up to two weeks).
In most factories allowing holidays (97 per cent), work-ers going on holiday are paid their previous wages, or an average weekly wage.
We find, therefore, that even in the leading industry of an advanced country the system of holidays for workers is disgracefully inadequate.
But the workers are coming to realise the need for regular and adequate rest and by their insistence the organised workers will be able to achieve success in this sphere too.

Printed from the Pravda textTHE MEANING OF AN “HISTORIC” FORMULA The press is still exercised over the adoption of the so-called lack-of-confidence-in-the-government formula by the Fourth Duma (on the Ministry of the Interior estimates), by the votes of the Octobrists and the Cadets.
Indeed, the formula, like the comments on it in the liberal press, deserves serious consideration.
This has really raised ques-tions of principle: it is essential to return to them again and again.
The leader-writer in Rech solemnly declared (No.
137) that May 21, the day this formula was adopted, “will go down as a date of historic significance”.
Our liberals are past masters at uttering loud and ringing phrases of this kind; but the very first attempt at a serious analysis of the meaning of the Duma’s decision betrays their astounding shallowness and helplessness.
The liberals ignore the most fundamental and indubita-ble facts which reveal the meaning of the Duma formula.
Firstly, of the parties which adopted the formula, neither the Octobrists nor the Progressists 266 (with whom the Ca-dets are in practice indissolubly tied up!) proposed rejection of the estimates.
The rejection of the estimates on the part of the Cadets was only a theatrical gesture to catch the democrats, since all knew perfectly well that the Cadets would in practice support the Octobrists.
The “historic” formula is a phrase, since the majority of the bourgeois parties did not even venture to use their unquestionable “parliamentary” right to reject the budget.
And without the support of both the Octobrists and the Progressists the Cadets are nil in the Duma and in the country.
Secondly, what does the ideological and political con-tent of the formula amount to? “We insist on the earliestimplementation of extensive reforms,” says the formula adopted by the Octobrists.
That is what the Progressists also said.
The same was demanded, in even stronger terms— “radical reforms”!—by the “Centre” (i.
e.
, the semi-Octobr-ists and semi-nationalists).
The same reformist attitude is fully adopted by the Cadet formula: their wording is somewhat sharper, but the ideas are exclusively reformist.
Thirdly, all the formulas, from that of the Cadets to that of the Octobrists, give a clear expression of the reaction-ary standpoint.
In this respect, contrary to the lying assurances of Rech, the Octobrist formula is not to the right but to the left of the Progressist, and even of the Cadet, formulas.
See and judge for yourselves: (1) The Progressists: (the Ministry) “is sowing in the country the seeds of trouble threatening the security of the state”; (2) The Cadets: “such a situation is a serious threat to state and public security”; (3) The Octobrists: “the Ministry is destroying respect for the law and the authorities among the people, thereby strengthening the mood of opposition.
” Translated from the language of “official policy” into ordinary human terms, this means one thing: the Cadets, the Octobrists and the Progressists all promise to provide better protection for the landowners, not as individuals but as a class, of course, than the present system does.
Fourthly, all these three parties start from nationalism and chauvinism.
The Ministry, they allege, “weakens the power of Russia” (say the Octobrists and the Progressists) or “the external might of the state” (say the Cadets, even more clearly!).
Such are the facts hushed up and distorted by the lib-erals.
The “historic” formula of the Fourth Duma is a compact between the Cadets and the Octobrists, with the help of the Progressists, on censuring the government and expressing the wish for “radical reforms ” , provided the budget is voted and the standpoint of reactionary national-ism and chauvinism is clearly expressed.

1 2 6 Printed from the Pravda text WHOM DOES SUPPORT COME? Our liberal press has taken the notorious Fourth Duma formula on the Ministry of the Interior estimates to mean that “the government is acting in something of a vacuum.
.
.
.
The government has no friends in the country with the exception of the subsidised newspapers, and the handfuls of politicians who are also subsidised and are loyal only so long as the subsidy lasts.
” That is the opinion of the “serious”, professorial Russkiye Vedomosti, and that’s no joke! “The government is completely isolated, and finds no support even in the political groups it set up itself.
” That is the opinion of Rech.
It would probably be hard to match the puerility dis-played in these observations by the professors, lawyers, writers and deputies of the liberal camp.
Theirs is a truly incurable parliamentary cretinism, in a country where “there is, thank God, no parliament”! 267 In a vacuum, you say? But haven’t you heard, Messrs.
professors and deputies, of the Council of the United Nobility, and of its support of the government’s policy; of the hundred million or so of dessiatines of the best land in the best parts of Russia belonging to the landowning class; of all the key civil and military posts held by the same class; of the sugar and other finance barons among the same class? You haven’t heard of all that? Oh, ye wise statesmen of liberalism! The government, you say, is completely isolated, it has no friends in the country? But what are you there for, gentlemen? Wasn’t it you, together with the Progressists and the Octobrists, who voted the estimates of the Ministry of the Interior?Imagine the existence of millionaire acquaintances who easily give you as much money as you want, while expres-sing “wishes” which are not binding on anybody.
Don’t you think, gentlemen, that we should be entitled to call these millionaires our friends, and that we should not feel our-selves “isolated” (among the millionaires)? But by your formula you have extended to the govern-ment not only material but also great ideological support.
This is very important, and you must not think that we shall allow you to dodge this ticklish question before the public.
What was the argument about in the Duma? To vote the funds, but to express a wish for—the reform of the police and for “normal limits of the legal system”, said the na-tionalists.
To vote the funds, but to express a desire for radical or broad reforms, said the Octobrists, adding that their unequivocal stand is counter-revolutionary national-ism and chauvinism.
And now all the liberals perform this trick: they keep silent about the addition, but express delight over the demand for “radical reforms”! All that is lacking is an addendum to their list, on the suggestion of some clever liquidator, on “freedom of association and review of agrarian legislation”.
.
.
.
The feudal landowners are backing the old system.
The bourgeoisie is in favour of reform.
By its “formula” it inflicted a moral blow on the government.
But at the same time that bourgeoisie gave moral support to the govern-ment by emphasising its counter-revolutionary attitude! And such support is a hundred times more effective and weighty than dozens of “moral” blows.
The “historic” Duma formula provides fresh confirma-tion that the June Third system 268 has entered a blind alley.
And the bourgeoisie, maintaining the position de-scribed, cannot get out of that blind alley.
The experience of history teaches us that the bourgeoisie may daydream about reforms, stagnate in a blind alley and bear the yoke of the Purishkeviches for decades, unless the crisis is re-solved the way the liberals dread and hope to exorcise.

1 2 7 Printed from the Pravda text FRANCE OUR CORRESPONDENT This paper has already reported the remarkable act of spinelessness on the part of Gustave Hervé.
This smart journalist and agitator, a man without socialist training or socialist education, went over (from the ranks of the professors) to the workers’ party, with all the habits and practices of a bourgeois intellectual.
He began as an op-portunist.
Then he swung over to the “extreme Left”, and for a long time preached semi-anarchist ideas, “terrifying” the bourgeoisie with noisy outcries in an anti-militarist spirit.
Lately he has tended to turn away from the anarchists and to make his way back to the party, and towards rec-ognition of the parliamentary struggle and of educational and organisational work.
But there again, this intellectual smarty wobbled, and swung back to the opportunists.
Being an impressionist, too much swayed by the last impression and prone to spineless vacillation, he has been so “ scared” by the present reactionary wave of chauvinism, national-ism and imperialism in France that he has begun preach-ing a return to the “bloc” policy, i.
e.
, an alliance with the bourgeois Radicals.
In order to save the Republic in France it is essential, he asserts, to have a bloc with the Radicals; otherwise the reactionaries in France will once again re-store the monarchy or the Empire! It is hardly necessary to say that, apart from extreme opportunists, the French Socialists ridicule the spineless Hervé, and energetically protest against the bloc.
Recently one of the organs of the workers’ party published in theSouth of France carried a number of statements by leading Socialists against the bloc.
It is the Socialists who began and are carrying on the campaign against reaction, these leading workers rightly say; it is the Socialists who campaigned among the masses with their protest against the law for a return to three years’ military service (i.
e.
, a return to the reactionary, barrack-room and absolutely undemocratic army).
It is the Socialists who are working for a proletarian bloc, i.
e.
, the alliance of socialist workers and syndicalist work-ers.
Among the Radicals and “Radical-Socialists” (a petty-bourgeois party resembling our Narodniks) only a tiny section supports this truly democratic campaign of the Socialists, and then with many waverings.
Why then have a bloc? Alliance with those who waver will weaken the pressure of the masses and increase the vacillation! Meanwhile, the Socialists have never refused to support the Radicals to the extent that they oppose the reactionaries.
Here, for example, are Messrs.
Charles Dumont and Alfred Masse, true-blue “Radical-Socialists”, writes one Socialist, who are backing the three-year service law in the expectation of securing a ministerial post.
Here is Clemen-ceau “himself”, the leader of the Radicals, carrying on a campaign for this law.
Here is another prominent leader of the Radicals, Léon Bourgeois, who has also declared in favour of the law.
Lastly, in the Military Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, the law was adopted by 17 votes to 4, the latter exclusively socialist.
How can there be a bloc, then, with this shameless bour-geois party of Radicals and “Radical-Socialists”? Only by agitating against it among the masses can the French Socialists detach all democratic elements from that party, thereby obliging some part of it to go left, towards democ-racy.
Being completely dependent on the masses at the elections (since France, of course, has universal suffrage and parliamentary government), many Radicals will think again and again before finally voting for a reactionary law well known to be unpopular among the masses.
The only serious support for democracy and the Republic in France (as everywhere else) is the masses, the massesof workers and with them also the small peasants, and not the parliamentary politicians, buffoons, careerists and ad-venturers of the bourgeois parties, who declare themselves “Radical-Socialists” one day, only to sell out democracy and country the next day (for the sake of some ministerial job or profitable deal, in the form of some concession or post in a millionaire syndicate, etc.
)—(as the French bour-geois sold France to Bismarck in 1871, out of fear of the Paris workers’ uprising against wage-slavery).
The French Socialists, who are fighting the idea of a bloc and are extending their socialist work and agitation among the masses, deserve the warmest greetings.

Printed from the Pravda textDEPUTY FRANK FAVOURS THE MASS STRIKE The speech of the well-known Baden Social-Democrat Frank, a most prominent representative of the opportunist wing, in favour of the mass strike as a means of struggle for electoral reform in Prussia, is something of an event in the German Socialist Party.
The Social-Democratic Party organisation in Wilmers-dorf, a suburb of Berlin, invited Frank to give a lecture on the subject.
The bourgeois press, expecting peaceable and tranquillising words to come “out of Baden”, loudly ad-vertised the meeting.
The free publicity was magnificent.
The meeting turned out to be a huge and most impressive one.
But whether because he was addressing the militant Berlin workers or because as a southerner, accustomed to the freer atmosphere of Southern Germany, he was outraged at the shameless domination of the “Junkers” (the German Black-Hundred gentry) whom he saw at closer quarters in Berlin, Frank made a fiery speech in favour of the mass strike.
The speaker began by outlining internal politics in Prus-sia.
Frank castigated the domination of the Junkers, the reactionary electoral law for the Prussian Landtag (a law rather like our own Third Duma law) and the absence of elementary democratic guarantees.
When he noted that under the Prussian electoral law the keeper of a brothel had first-class electoral rights, and the Prime Minister, only third-class rights, and that this was characteristic of the Prussian “way of life”, the audience roared with laughter in approval of his assessment.
The Berlin workers—Frank said with a smile—have proved by their struggle against Jagow (the, mayor whovainly tried to prohibit demonstrations in 1910) that they have talents in the sphere of street manoeuvres.
The speaker recalled the examples of mass strikes in history: by the Chartists in England; the Belgians in 1893, 1902 and 1912; the Swedes in 1903; the Italians in 1904, and the Russians in 1905; he dwelt in greater detail on the last example, stressing the help which the Russian workers then gave their neighbours and brothers, the Austrian work-ers.
The mere threat of a political strike then proved suf-ficient to win adult suffrage for the Austrians.
In Prussia and in Germany, exclaimed Frank, we have the best labour movement in the world and the most ex-tensive working-class press.
Let us then learn mass struggle from the proletariat of the whole world! (Enthusiastic approval and applause of the audience.
) Naturally, this new form of struggle involves sacrifice and danger, Frank continued; but when have political battles not entailed danger and sacrifice? Once we have realised the necessity of struggle, we must carry it on to the end, we must pilot our ship forward despite the pos-sible reefs ahead.
Those who fear them and remain in port will certainly be safe, but they will never get to the other shore—the objective for which we are striving.
Enthusiastically received by the meeting, Frank’s speech showed once again the great indignation the reactionaries have aroused in the German workers.
A mighty protest is maturing in the German proletariat slowly but surely.

1 3 2 Signed: Karich Printed from the Pravda textAN INTERESTING CONGRESS An interesting congress opened at Kharkov yesterday, June 12.
It is interesting in two respects.
For one thing, it is the first general Zemstvo congress on the statistics of public education.
And then it has been honoured by particular attention on the part of the authorities.
The chairman of the congress has been appointed by the author-ities, and the specialists have been “ screened ” , as B.
Ve-selovsky puts it in Russkoye Slovo, also by the authorities.
No representatives of the press have been allowed to attend the congress.
These measures—which even from the “Russian” point of view seem to be unduly, let us say, prudent—can hardly be explained by the fact that the congress meets in one of the Ukrainian centres.
This Zemstvo congress will be at-tended not only by Ukrainian statisticians and Zemstvo officials, 269 but also by men in this field who come from all the nationalities of Russia.
The subject of the congress is apparently not to the liking of the authorities, although the only item on the agenda will be the organisation of statistics, what has been done, why too little has been done, while more should be done, and better.
Public education lags more in Russia than anywhere else in the world.
Duma deputy Badayev pointed out in his speech that even among the American Negroes there are only 44 per cent illiterates—in Europe it is 1 or 2 per cent— whereas in Russia 79 per cent are illiterate! However, despite a thousand obstacles, public education has lately been growing and developing faster than before.
To know the truth about the state of education is the directand most vital interest of the masses of the people in gen-eral, and the workers in particular.
It would not be at all difficult to organise the public education statistics on European lines.
Every teacher could easily report every year the required information about every pupil (age, nationality, family conditions, economic condition of parents, etc.
) and about every teacher (educa-tion, salary, working day, nationality and so forth).
A small number of statisticians, annually processing such data, could provide the state with most abundant and valuable material, both on the conditions in which the young generation is being brought up and educated, and on a number of aspects of popular life, .

I think the sub-ject was well chosen and has been correctly elaborated, but the article will need some polishing up.
There is far too much—how shall I put it?—“agitation”, which is out of place in an article on a theoretical subject.
Either you yourself, I think, ought to work it over, or we could do it.
Many thanks for your news of Kostrov.
Please ask Avel to write and inform us more frequently.
This is important, because we know nothing.

It is extremely important to fight nationalists of this brand (and the Ukrainian Social-Democrats), who are more subtle! I will insist that the editorial board of Pravda insert your article.
But in my view the readers—40,000 Russian (and for the most part Great-Russian) workers—will not understand it.
My advice, if you don’t mind my giving it, is that you should write one more article, which is to go in first.
An in-troduction, a brief general sketch of the question of “cen-tralism” and “separatism” (you have chosen the terms very well and correctly) among Social-Democrats of the Ukraine.
Give the reader an introduction to the question.
Describe the general trends, what they are and what their history is (briefly).
Then there is one more question: Basok, it is said, has turned towards nationalism and separatism.
That’s what I have heard; is it true? Could you get me his “famous” article (1910 or 1911 or 1912) with the turn in question? 275 Then recently, they say, someone or other “united” at a conference in Lvov: the Spilka 276 group with the Ukrai-nian Social-Democrats, or with the Dontsovs? I was pro-mised the joint resolutions from Lvov, but haven’t had them yet.
What do you know about this? 277 Should not a couple of lines be added to say that even among the Spilka group there are some who are, unfortunately, sliding down to nationalism and separatism? Greetings and best wishes, N.

51 Dear Comrade, I quite understand your indignation against the scoun-drels in the so-called Chief Executive, but would advise the commission 281 first of all, nevertheless, to secure a formal refusal from the Chief Executive.

I advise you to write a careful information letter on behalf of the commission to Huysmans (mainly pressing the point that the Zarzad Glówny * refuses to have its “judge-ment” reviewed by a panel of I.

Printed from the originalTO MAXIM GORKY Dear Alexei Maximych, I am sending you today by registered book-post the begin-ning of a novel which is to go into Prosveshcheniye.
We think that you will not object.
But if, by any chance, you should, cable to Prosveshcheniye: “Postpone Voitinsky ” or “Don’t carry Voitinsky’s novel”.
282 The news that you are being given a new kind of treatment by “a Bolshevik”, even if a former one, has really worried me.
The saints preserve us from comrade-doctors in general, and Bolshevik-doctors in particular! Really and truly, in 99 cases out of 100 the comrade-doctors are “asses”, as a good doctor once said to me.
I assure you that you should consult (except on minor complaints) only first-class men.
It is terrible to try out on yourself the inventions of a Bol-shevik! The only reassuring thing is the supervision of professors in Naples, if these professors really know their business.

BUKHARIN Dear Comrade, We were very willingly preparing to publish your article on Struve’s book.
285 But in a second reading we realised that the passage about the serf economy would inevitably be understood in Party circles as advice to delete the confiscation of landed estates in the Programme.
This needs discussing.
Why not throw out the passage for the time being? We thought you did not want to start a discussion just at present.
If we are wrong, and you did want to start a discussion, drop us a line: if you insist, we shall carry the article.

Printed from the original1914 TO THE EDITORS OF PUT PRAVDY February 9, 1914 Dear Colleagues, I have received a letter from the secretary about the unfortunate article which has put the newspaper in pe-ril.
286 It’s a great pity that publicity was given (was it a board decision?) to this unfortunate article in which they contrived to find evidence of ties between the papers.

Yet the articles have not been pub-lished, and (as though making a mockery of any collec-tive work) you haven’t written me a single line for a whole month about their fate! ((If they are too long, which however is improbable, I would have sent them to Prosveshcheniye.

Trotsky’s venture is of great importance 292 ; the break-up of the August bloc 293 is complete (the Letts have withdrawn from the Organising Committee!).
294 Grigory says that you have continued (1) the statistics of collections (by workers’ groups) after October 1, 1913 (up to January 1, 1914) 295 (2) the statistics of voting for the Seven and for the Six (also at least up to January 1, 1914, or February 1, 1914).
296 Please complete this work as soon as you can, and send it over immediately: it will go into the pamphlet we are sending out shortly.
297 Hurry! I have received No.

HOURWICH Cracow, February 27, 1914 Dear Colleague, I have long since received your book, Immigration and Labour, 299 and have been looking for your address to send you my thanks.
But it proved far from easy to find your address.
I got it only today, and hasten to express my gratitude to you for sending me the book.
I have already written an article 300 about it, and on the basis of it, in our St.
Petersburg Social-Democratic newspaper Pravda, and intend to write again.
I believe that this work provides a mass of valuable material for the study of capitalism, being at the same time something of an application of the best methods of our Zemstvo statisticians on Western soil.
The comrade who sent me your address (Mr.
John Ellert) has written to tell me that you could use your influence to help obtain all kinds of material from the Bureau of the Census in Washington.
May I, therefore, ask you to do me a favour, provided of course that this will not give you too much trouble or interfere with your work.
When I made a study of American agricultural statis-tics (Vol.
V.
Agriculture—Census of 1900) in Paris, I found a great deal of interesting matter.
Now, in Cracow, I am unable to obtain these publications.
Cahan, editor of the Jewish socialist paper in New York, 301 who was over here a year ago, promised to have them sent, but has apparently forgotten to do so.
They say that when requested by the right people the American Bureau of the Census will send its publications free of charge even to foreign countries.
If that is so, couldyou put in a word? (I could send the Bureau of the Census library my books, The Development of Capitalism in Rus-sia and the Agrarian Question.
302 ) What I need most is Agriculture, Vol.
V, Census of 1900, and the same volume of the Census of 1910 (if that is not yet out, then the bulletins).
If that is impossible, would you be so kind as to send a postcard to Mr.
John Ellert (c/o Novy Mir.

Sent to New York First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIII Printed from the originalTO THE EDITORS OF PUT PRAVDY Dear Colleagues, I welcome your paper in every way, and particularly its obvious improvement.
At last the literary side is begin-ning to be well organised! The next job is the business side.
You must not leave the question of subscribers “unpub-lished” either: you should announce their number, other-wise you cannot rise from the small circle level to full-scale organisation, from a private enterprise to a collective one.
Nor can I pass over an obvious mistake in No.
22, where side by side with the correct resolution from the Vyborg workers (on Buryanov) you have, without comment from the editors, a longer and disgustingly double-faced resolu-tion from the Zurich group.
304 Pravda’s word is law; its silence tends to confuse the workers; its abstention sows bewilderment.
With Buryanov one must be “as wise as a serpent”, but the editorial board has departed from such wisdom.
We praise him only for leaving the liquidators, and not at all for lone-wolf “independence”.
In this the liquidators are right, and there is no greater danger for a politician in the struggle than to take up the wrong position.
Yet the Zurich group support Buryanov in his erroneous, false, double-faced position! And we give them a platform— what for? Knowing that the Zurich group are a minority abroad! Knowing that we cannot make all the groups abroad express their stand in Pravda! Buryanov should be made to understand and feel the falseness of his attitude.
You have left the liquidators? Good.
You have proposed equality? Good.
What then? It is time to make a choice.
We will not support you in double-dealing (the pendulum game).
The liquidators are attacking you as an “independent Social-Democrat”: they are right, and we shall not defend you.
Here is a reasonable period for you, here is assistance dur-ing that period (tacit, with speeches, etc.
), but no more than that.
Either you make your choice (within 2 or 4 weeks)—or you get no more help.
That is the only way to act.
Otherwise in the immediate future (both at the Vienna Congress and earlier 305 ) Burya-nov’s stand will do us harm, and people will be justified in telling us that we are supporting an “independent”.
The editorial board must find an occasion to say (1) that the Vyborg workers are right, not the Zurich group; (2) that, apart from a section of those abroad (Zurich), no one in Russia has approved or will approve “independence”.
This must be done.
All the best, and wishing the paper every kind of im-provement and success! V.
I.
P.
S.
Within a month, Buryanov will say: the Zurich group supported me, and only the workers of Vyborg con-demned me! And we shall not have had general mass sup-port for the Vyborg group.
But that is just what we need most now.
If you “give Buryanov a free hand” and your support, he will consolidate his position against us, and that would be a crime against the will of the majority of the workers and against the “Marxist whole”.

I ask you particularly not to be late (as you were with No.
2 of Borba) in sending me Yedinstvo: the “pro-Party Bolsheviks” 308 on it should, in my opinion, be held up as a laughing-stock, with the straightforward statement that they are zeros, who have never had a single coherent thought on a single question.
And Plekhanov should be told: it is a pity that he is now nullifying his great services in the struggle against the liquidators during the period of disorganisation, in the struggle against the Machists at the height of Machism, by preaching what he himself cannot explain.
Unity with whom, then? with Nasha Zarya? with Severnaya Rabochaya Gazeta?—and on what terms? We stand for unity, on precisely specified terms, which have long since been approved by the majority of the work-ers: start from below, enter the underground organisation, prove by deeds your refusal to join in liquidating the Party.
Not all who “cry” unity understand what unity is, or help to bring it about.
Those who destroy the will of the majority of the workers are not unifiers but disrupters.
(A struggle against Plekhanov is unavoidable, now that he has become involved in this idiotic affair, but he should be set apart from Lyova and Mark, with the emphasis that he had done service, but it is a pity that he is once again on the roundabout.
)Write me more frequently, even if briefly.
Otherwise it is hard to get the co-operation going.

SHKLOVSKY Dear Friend, Yesterday I received a worrying letter from Samoilov.
309 He is worse.
He can’t sleep.
He is bored.
Chlenov advised cold (!?) baths.
After four baths Samoi-lov felt even worse.
This is terribly unpleasant, because we undertook, so to speak, to get him cured.
I am sending him today a letter of recommendation from Landau, the local nerve special-ist, to Dr.
De Montet at the “Mon Repos” sanatorium in Vevey.
Evidently Samoilov should be taken to the best nerve specialist and transferred to a sanatorium, with regular treatment and care.
Do this, please.
Feel free to spend on telephones and travelling: we shall cover all this if need be, because we must get Samoilov on his feet again by the autumn at all costs.
If necessary, go and see Sali once more.
But evidently this calls for a nerve specialist.
I hope you will find the best one in Switzerland, and take Samoilov to him.
I am writing about the same matter to Rivlin: please come to an arrangement with him to act together and share the burden.
They say boredom is very harmful for neurasthenics.
But what is to be done? Should we take Samoilov along with us to Poronin (we are going there on May 1) or to Zakopane? We could do that, but it rains there all the summer.
Write to me about the result of your visit to the doctor and about your decisions.
We might now try the “Mon Repos” sanatorium.
Regards to your family.

Yours, Lenin Written at the end of April 1 9 1 4 Sent from Cracow to Berne First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIII Printed from the originalOUR TASKS We have given a brief review of the history of the working-class press in Russia and of the origin of Pravda.
We have tried to show how the age-long history of democratic movements in Russia led to the formation of an independ-ent working-class democratic movement under the ideo-logical banner of Marxism—and how the twenty years’ history of Marxism and the working-class movement in Russia, as a result of the long struggle of the workers’ vanguard against petty-bourgeois opportunist trends, led to the rallying of the vast majority of class-conscious workers around Pravda, which was created by the famous upsurge of the working-class movement in the spring of 1912.
We have seen how, during the paper’s two years, class-conscious Pravdist workers united ideologically, and to a certain extent also organisationally, by their efforts creat-ing and supporting, strengthening and developing a con-sistently Marxist workers’ press.
Strictly insisting on their continuity with the organised Marxists of the preceding historical epoch, not breaking any of their decisions, build-ing the new on the foundations of the old, and going system-atically, unswervingly ahead to the firmly and precisely stated aim of consistent Marxism, the Pravdist workers have begun the solution of an unusually difficult historic task.
A whole host of enemies, a whole mass of difficulties, both external and internal, arose in the way of the labour movement in the 1908-11 epoch.
In no country in the world has the working-class movement hitherto succeeded in emerging from such crises while maintaining its continuity, its organised character, its loyalty to the old decisions, programme and tactics.
But the Russian workers—or more exactly the workers of Russia—succeeded in this; they succeeded in emerging with flying colours from an incredibly painful crisis, re-maining loyal to the past and maintaining continuity of organisation, while mastering new forms of training for their forces, new methods of education and mobilisation of fresh generations of the proletariat for the solution by old methods of old but still outstanding historic problems.
Of all the classes of Russian society, the working class of Russia alone succeeded in this—not, of course, because it stood higher than the workers of other countries: on the contrary, it is still far behind them in organisation and class-consciousness.
It succeeded in this because it relied at once on the experience of the workers of the whole world, both on their theoretical experience, on the achievements of their class-consciousness, their science and experience summed up by Marxism and on the practical experience of the proletarians of neighbouring countries, with their magnificent workers’ press and their mass organisations.
The Pravdist workers, having safeguarded their own line in the most difficult and painful of periods against perse-cution from without and against despondency, scepticism, timidity and betrayal within, can now say to themselves, with full awareness and resolution: we know that we are on the right path, but we are taking only the first steps along that path, and the principal difficulties still lie ahead of us, we still have to do a great deal to consolidate our own position completely, and to raise to conscious activity millions of backward, dormant and downtrodden prole-tarians.
Let the petty-bourgeois “fellow-travellers” of the pro-letariat, slavishly following the liberals, hold forth contemptuously against “the underground”, against “adver-tising the illegal press”; let them cherish illusions about the June Third “legality”.
We know the fragile nature of that “legality”, we shall not forget the historic lessons of the importance of an illegal press.
Developing further our “Pravdist” work, we shall push ahead with the purely newspaper side hand in hand with all sides of the workers’ cause.
Put Pravdy must be circulated in three, four and five times as many copies as today.
We must put out a trade union supplement, and have representatives of all trade unions and groups on the editorial board.
Our paper must have regional (Moscow, Urals, Caucasian, Baltic, Ukrain-ian) supplements.
We must consolidate—despite all the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois nationalists of all nations without exception—the unity of the workers of all the nationalities of Russia, and for this purpose, incidentally, start supplements in our paper devoted to the workers’ movement of the various nationalities of Russia.
Both the foreign department of Put Pravdy and the chronicle of the organisational, ideological and political life of the class-conscious workers should be expanded many times over.
We must create a kopek Vechernaya Pravda.
Put Pravdy in its present shape is essential for the class-conscious worker and should be still further enlarged, but it is too dear, too difficult, too big for the worker in the street, for the rank-and-filer, for any of the millions not yet drawn into the movement.
The advanced worker will never forget about them, for he knows that craft isolation, the emer-gence of a labour aristocracy and its separation from the masses mean degradation and brutalisation of the prole-tarian and his transformation into a miserable philistine, a pitiful flunkey; it means loss of all hope of his emancipa-tion.
There is need to start a kopek Vechernaya Pravda, with a circulation of 200,000 or 300,000 copies in the very thick of the proletarian and semi-proletarian masses, showing them the light of the world-wide working-class movement, inspiring them with faith in their strength, impelling them towards unity and helping them to rise to full class-consciousness.
We must secure a much greater degree of organisation on the part of the readers of Put Pravdy than there is now, in their various factories, districts, etc.
, and more active participation in correspondence and running and circulat-ing the paper.
We must get the workers to take a regular part in editorial work.
We must have—there is in fact a great deal more thatwe must have! We cannot list here everything that we need; we would even be ridiculous (and worse) if we attempted here to enumerate all spheres, or even the principal fields of our work! We know that we are on the right path.
We know that we are marching hand in hand with the forward-looking workers of all countries.
We know that this field of our work is only a small part of the whole, and that we are still at the beginning of our great road to emancipation.
But we also know that nothing on earth can stop us on that road.

SHKLOVSKY Dear Grigory Lvovich, I have just learned that the International Congress has been transferred to Paris for August 9 (N.
S.
).
315 I hope you are going—and well ahead of time, in order to make preparations in Paris (Kamsky was in the delegation at Brussels, 316 and will give you all the information).
Reply at once.
Even more important is the question of Samoilov’s going.
Will he be able to go? It is quite probable that none of the members of the Duma will be able to arrive in time from Russia.
Therefore it is essential that Samoilov should go.
It would be best for you to arrange to travel with him.
He could be fixed up (if his treatment so requires) in a pen-sion near Paris (provided there is a telephone) (or even in a clinic) in the country, half an hour or so away by rail.
He will have to come to Paris two or three times at most, for 3 or 4 hours each time (possibly even less), so that from the standpoint of his treatment this can probably be arranged.
It is only necessary to think it all out beforehand and arrange it by correspondence.
(We are not going; Litvinov or Kamsky will attend the I.
S.
B.
)—write to Dr.
Wladi-mirsky (rue Baillon.
10.
Paris); he will give advice.
I ask you particularly to make every effort to prepare and arrange this as carefully as possible.
If it turns out that Samoilov’s journey is absolutely impossible, telegraph me immediately (the address is: Uljanow.
Poronin): “nie-vozmozno”.
* Otherwise, if he can go and you undertake to organise everything, telegraph: “jedet” ( = Samoilov is going) or “jedem” (= both you and Samoilov are going).

KOBETSKY Dear Comrade, Our trip did not come off.
318 I don’t know whether you have got the letters.
If you have, send me a reply to check whether the post is working.
You may now find yourself, as an exception and an extremely rare one at that, an in-habitant of a non-belligerent country; so that if only the post from you to us functions, you must be sure to keep us informed, and send us information from the papers to which we have no access.
Of course, only the most important information (particularly about Russia).
Let me know whether you will have (or whether you already have) any good contacts with Stockholm, and whether you can transmit letters, provide an address for money from Russia, etc.
Regards, Yours, V.

KARPINSKY September 6 Dear Comrade, I arrived here safely yesterday with my whole family, after a brief captivity in Austria.
Zinoviev will also be coming.
We thought of settling in Geneva, where all our old sympathies attract us.
But then we began to hesitate in favour of Berne.
They say that there’s a rush to Geneva of new French émigrés from Paris, Brussels, etc.
We wonder if there is an excessive rise in prices, particularly of rents.
Also we shall have to make our arrangements on a temporary basis: is it possible to take furnished rooms (two small ones), with use of kitchen, by the month? One other question: if it is not too much trouble, please call at the Société de lecture (Grand’ Rue.
11) and take their rules; I must see whether they have been changed in any way.
It is this Société 320 that particularly attracts me to Geneva, although here too?.
.

It’s expensive.

What about a printing press? Is there a Russian one? Can one now pub-lish a leaflet, etc.
? In Russian? With special precautions, or as before (against the war, of course, and against the new type of nationalists, from Haase to Vandervelde and Guesde—they’ve all played false!).
You will oblige me very much by replying to all these questions as soon as possible.
Are there any other Bolshevik comrades in Geneva? In-cluding those going to Russia? Best regards from all of us to you, to Comrade Olga and all our friends.

KARPINSKY Dear Friend, I have your letter telling me of the talk with Sigg about the publication.
321 That’s excellent! Take as much as you require of the 160 francs (as little as possible, of course, because we are hoping to publish a little miscellany) and publish the manifesto 322 (not the theses 323 but the mani-festo) with the maximum precautions; don’t print many (200 or 300) and hide the stock without fail at the Swiss deputy’s.
If you do not have the text of the manifesto, but only the theses, get the manifesto at Lausanne.
I am awaiting your reply.
Yours, Lenin We shall send what is published to Paris and to Russia: a hundred for abroad, two hundred for Russia.
We shall write again about how to send them and to what addresses.

PLEKHANOV’S LECTURE “ON THE ATTITUDE OF THE SOCIALISTS TO THE WAR”, SEPTEMBER 28 (OCTOBER 11), 1914 324 BRIEF NEWSPAPER REPORT “Our theses, worked out by the Central Committee of the Party,” Comrade Lenin began, “were sent to the Italians, and many of them, unfortunately not all, were incorporated in the Lugano resolution.
325 The opponent very much liked the first part of Plekha-nov’s report, dealing with the betrayal of the German Social-Democrats, 326 but the same could not be said about the second part, in which Plekhanov tried to justify com-pletely the stand of the French socialists.
How was it possible to defend French socialism, which had called on the Italians to enter the war? It was difficult to find any passages to justify this appeal even in the ex-tremely elastic resolutions of the International.
The present war had shown the enormous wave of op-portunism that had risen out of the depths of European socialism.
The European opportunists, in order to rehabil-itate themselves, had tried to fall back on the old and hack-neyed argument about “keeping the organisation intact”.
The orthodox Germans had gone back on their stand to preserve the formal unity of the party.
He, Comrade Lenin, had always pointed out the opportunism lurking in such an approach, he had always fought against conciliatory attitudes which sacrifice principles.
All the resolutions of Vandervelde and Kautsky suffered from this opportunist tendency of smoothing over obvious contradictions.
Kautsky, in his article “About the War”, 327 had even talked him-self into justifying everybody, asserting that all were right from their point of view, since subjectively they considered themselves to be in danger and subjectively considered their right to exist to have been violated.
Of course, from the standpoint of the psychology of the moment and humani-tarian considerations, such a mood was more comprehen-sible among the French and could therefore be viewed with greater sympathy; still socialism could not argue from fear of attack alone, and it had to be frankly said that there was more chauvinism than socialism in the behaviour of the French.
Plekhanov, Lenin said further, criticised those comrades who asserted that it was impossible to find out who at-tacked first.
In the opponent’s opinion, the present war was not at all accidental, and had not depended on this or that attack, but had been prepared by all the conditions of development of bourgeois society.
It had been predicted long ago, and precisely in such a combination and precisely along such lines.
The Basle Congress spoke about it quite clearly, and even foresaw that Serbia would be the pretext for a conflict.
Comrade Lenin then analysed the duty of socialists in wartime.
Social-Democrats did their duty only when they fought chauvinist passions at home.
And the Serbian Social-Democrats 3 2 8 offered the best example of such fulfilment of duty.
Not forgetting the words of Marx that “the working-men have no country”, the proletariat should take part, not in defending the old framework of the bourgeois states, but in creating a new framework for socialist republics.
And the great mass of the proletariat would realise this through its sure instinct.
What was going on in Europe was nothing but speculation on the worst—and the most deep-rooted—of prejudices.
“Our task,” said Lenin, “is not to swim with the tide, but to transform the national, the pseudo-national war into a resolute encounter of the proletariat with the ruling classes.
” Lenin then went on to criticise the entry of socialists into governments, and pointed out the responsibility falling on socialists who back their government’s every step.
“It is better to go to a neutral country and from there to tell the truth, it is better to make a free and independent appeal to the proletariat, than to become a Minister”— with those words the opponent ended his short speech.
Golos No.
33 , October 2, 1914 Printed from the Golos textLECTURE ON “THE PROLETARIAT AND THE WAR” OCTOBER 1 (14), 1914 329 NEWSPAPER REPORT The speaker divided his lecture into two parts: clari-fying the nature of the present war, and the attitude of socialists to the war.
For a Marxist clarifying the nature of the war is a neces-sary preliminary for deciding the question of his attitude to it.
But for such a clarification it is essential, first and foremost, to establish the objective conditions and concrete circumstances of the war in question.
It is necessary to consider the war in the historical environment in which it is taking place, only then can one determine one’s attitude to it.
Otherwise, the resulting interpretation will be not materialist but eclectic.
Depending on the historical circumstances, the relation-ship of classes, etc.
, the attitude to war must be different at different times.
It is absurd once and for all to renounce participation in war in principle.
On the other hand, it is also absurd to divide wars into defensive and aggressive.
In 1848, Marx hated Russia, because at that time democracy in Germany could not win out and develop, or unite the country into a single national whole, so long as the reaction-ary hand of backward Russia hung heavy over her.
In order to clarify one’s attitude to the present war, one must understand how it differs from previous wars, and what its peculiar features are.
Has the bourgeoisie given such an explanation? No.
Far from having given one, it will not manage to give one in any circumstances.
Judging by what is going on amongthe socialists, one might think that they, too, have no idea of the distinctive features of the present war.
Yet, the socialists have given an excellent explanation of it, and have predicted it.
More than that, there is not a single speech by a socialist deputy, not a single article by a socialist publicist, that does not contain that explanation.
It is so simple that people somehow do not take notice of it, and yet it provides the key to the cor-rect attitude to the present war.
The present war is an imperialist one, and that is its basic feature.
In order to clarify this, it is necessary to examine the nature of previous wars, and that of the imperialist war.
Lenin dwelt in considerable detail on the characteristics of wars at the end of the 18th and during the whole of the 19th centuries.
They were all national wars, which accom-panied and promoted the creation of national states.
These wars marked the destruction of feudalism, and were an expression of the struggle of the new, bourgeois society against feudal society.
The national state was a necessary phase in the development of capitalism.
The struggle for the self-determination of a nation, for its in-dependence, for freedom to use its language, for popular representation, served this end—the creation of national states, that ground necessary at a certain stage of capital-ism for the development of the productive forces.
Such was the character of wars from the time of the great French Revolution up to and including the Italian and Prussian wars.
This task of the national wars was performed either by democracy itself or with the help of Bismarck, quite in-dependently of the will and the consciousness of those who took part in them.
The triumph of present-day civilisation, the full flowering of capitalism, the drawing of the whole people and of all nations into capitalism—that was the outcome of national wars, the wars at the beginning of capitalism.
An imperialist war is quite a different matter.
On this point, there was no disagreement among the socialists of all countries and all trends.
At all congresses, in discussing resolutions on the attitude to a possible war, everyonewas always agreed that this war would be an imperialist one.
All European countries have already reached an equal stage in the development of capitalism, all of them have already yielded everything that capitalism can yield.
Capitalism has already attained its highest form, and is no longer exporting commodities, but capital.
It is beginning to find its national framework too small for it, and now the struggle is on for the last free scraps of the earth.
If national wars in the 18th and 19th centuries marked the beginning of capitalism, imperialist wars point to its end.
The whole end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century were filled with imperialist policy.
Imperialism is what impresses a quite specific stamp on the present war, distinguishing it from all its predeces-sors.
Only by examining this war in its distinctive historical environment, as a Marxist must do, can we clarify our attitude to it.
Otherwise we shall be operating with old conceptions and arguments, applied to a different, an old situation.
Among such obsolete conceptions are the fatherland idea and the division, mentioned earlier, of wars into defensive and aggressive.
Of course, even now there are blotches of the old colour in the living picture of reality.
Thus, of all the warring countries, the Serbs alone are still fighting for national existence.
In India and China, too, class-conscious prole-tarians could not take any other path but the national one, because their countries have not yet been formed into national states.
If China had to carry on an offensive war for this purpose, we could only sympathise with her, because objectively it would be a progressive war.
In exactly the same way, Marx in 1848 could call for an offensive war against Russia.
And so the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th are characterised by imperialist policy.
Imperialism is that state of capitalism when, having done all that it could, it turns towards decline.
It is a spe-cial epoch, not in the minds of socialists, but in actual relationships.
A struggle is on for a division of the remain-ing portions.
It is the last historical task of capitalism.
We cannot say how long this epoch will last.
There maywell be several such wars, but there must be a clear understanding that these are quite different wars from those waged earlier, and that, accordingly, the tasks facing socialists have changed.
To tackle these new tasks the proletarian party may need organisations of a very different type.
Kautsky, in his pamphlet Weg zur Macht, * pointed out, in making a careful and detailed examination of economic phenomena and drawing very cautious conclusions from them, that we were entering a phase quite unlike the old peaceful and gradual development.
It is hard to say just now what the new form of organi-sation, corresponding to this phase, should be.
But it is clear that in view of the new tasks, the proletariat will have to create new organisations or modify the old.
All the more absurd is the fear of disarray in one’s organisa-tion, so vividly manifest among the German Social-Demo-crats; all the more absurd is this legalism at all costs.
We know that the St.
Petersburg Committee has issued an illegal leaflet against the war.
The same has been done by the Caucasian and certain other organisations in Rus-sia.
There is no doubt that this could also be done abroad, without any rupture of ties.
Legality, of course, is a most valuable thing, and Engels had good reason to say: “Messrs.
bourgeois, you will have to be the first to break your legality!” 330 What is now going on might teach the German Social-Democrats a les-son, because a government which has always boasted of its legality is not put out by now having violated it all along the line.
In this respect, the brutal order of the Ber-lin Commandant, which he forced Vorwärts 331 to run on its front page, may prove useful.
But Vorwärts itself, once it renounced the class struggle on pain of being closed down, and promised not to refer to it until the end of the war, has committed suicide.
It is dead, as the Paris Golos, 332 now the best socialist paper in Europe, has rightly said.
The more frequently and the more violently I differed with Martov before, the more definitely I must say now that that writer is now doing precisely what a Social-Democrat * The Way to Power.
—Ed.
should do.
He is criticising his own government, he is un-masking his own bourgeoisie, he is accusing his own Ministers.
Meanwhile, those socialists who have disarmed in relation to their own government, and devote themselves to exposing and shaming the Ministers and ruling classes of another country, play the part of bourgeois writers.
Südekum himself is objectively playing the part of agent of the German Government, as others play it in relation to the French and Russian allies.
Socialists who fail to realise that the present war is im-perialist, who fail to take a historical view of it, will un-derstand nothing about the war.
They are capable of taking a childishly naïve view of it, in this sense, that at night one seized the other by the throat, and the neighbours have to save the victim of attack, or in cowardly fashion to shut themselves away from the light “behind locked doors” (in Plekhanov’s words).
We shall not allow ourselves to be deceived, and let the bourgeois advisers explain the war as simply as that: people were living at peace, then one attacked, and the other is defending himself.
Comrade Lenin read an extract from an article by Luz-zatti, carried by an Italian newspaper.
In that article, the Italian politician rejoices that the great victor in the war turned out to be .
.
.
the fatherland, the idea of father-land, and repeats that we should remember the words of Cicero who said that “civil war is the greatest evil”.
This is what the bourgeoisie have managed to achieve, this is what excites and delights them most, this is what they have spent vast sums and efforts on.
They are trying to con-vince us that it is the same old, conventional, national war.
No, indeed.
The era of national wars is past.
This is an imperialist war, and the task of socialists is to turn the “national” war into a civil war.
We all expected this imperialist war, and prepared for it.
And if this is so, it is not at all important who attacked first; all were preparing for the war, and the attacker was the one who thought it most advantageous to do so at the particular moment.
Comrade Lenin then went on to define the conception of “fatherland” from the socialist point of view.
This conception was clearly and precisely defined by the Communist Manifesto, in the brilliant pages whose truth has been fully tested and justified by experience.
Lenin read an extract from the Communist Manifesto, where the conception of fatherland is regarded as a historical category, which corresponds to the development of society at a definite stage and which later becomes unnecessary.
The proletariat cannot love what it has not got.
The pro-letariat has no country.
What are the tasks of the socialists in the present war? Comrade Lenin read the Stuttgart resolution, later con-firmed and supplemented at Copenhagen and Basle.
333 This resolution clearly states the socialists’ methods of combating the trends leading to war and their duties in respect of a war that has broken out.
These duties are de-fined by the examples of the Russian revolution and the Paris Commune.
The Stuttgart resolution was carefully worded, in consideration of all kinds of criminal laws, but it indicated the task clearly.
The Paris Commune is civil war.
The form, the time and the place are a different matter, but the direction of our work is clearly defined.
From this angle, Comrade Lenin then examined the actual stand taken by socialists in the various countries.
Apart from the Serbs, the Russians have done their duty, as the Italian Avanti! notes, and Keir Hardie is doing it by exposing the policy of Edward Grey.
Once the war is on, it is impossible to escape it.
One must go and do one’s duty as a socialist.
In a war, people think and ponder probably even more than “at home”.
One must go out and organise the proletariat there for the final aim, because it is utopian to imagine that the proletariat will tread a peaceful path to it.
It is impos-sible to go over from capitalism to socialism without break-ing up the national framework, just as it was impossible to pass from feudalism to capitalism without national ideas.

KARPINSKY Dear V.
K.
, I am sending you the manifesto on account of five amend-ments.
Please make them in the proofs as carefully as possible.
334 I am also sending “A Reply to Vandervelde” 335 —for setting.
As many articles as possible should be set in brevier.
We must get the maximum of material into the two pages.
It’s a pity that we hadn’t thought of this when sending the manifesto for setting.
The whole question now is, how many thousands of let-ters can be got into the two pages? The C.
O.
’s old format should be taken (there is no masthead in Geneva it is desirable to make up the new masthead as economically as possible, so as to lose the least space: say, have the masthead fit in a corner, instead of “covering” all three columns).
We are waiting for an exact calculation of the size: how many letters in brevier can be got in.
Best of all, send us both the proof of the manifesto (the second proof) and samples of all types, including the very smallest.
The masthead for the issue (this should be the next No.
of the C.
O.
) should also specify the price: 10 cts.
, I think.
In any case, it is essential to send us a proof of the issue made up into pages.
If the whole thing could be set up in brevier, with the C.
O.
format, we should have about 40,000 letters in the two pages.
We could then insert another couple of articles which we are preparing.
(If the manifesto has already beenset, and in an unsuitable type, etc.
, we shall publish it separately.
) You will have considerable correspondence expenses: everything must be sent in envelopes, not in wrappers.
Keep a record of your postal expenses and draw upon the “fund” (160 frs.
), otherwise you will be ruined! Ask Syoma to get us Sozialistische Monatshefte [all the issues since the war] from the Bundists: if necessary, we shall pay, and will guarantee to return them at the time fixed (even with a deposit, if required).
Best wishes, Yours, Lenin P.

can be ready.
I shall be lecturing at Montreux shortly (I don’t know exactly when) and can call on you, should it be necessary.

K.

Terrible! Will it always be like this? As regards the address to be put on the paper: is it worth while taking a case * ? After all (1) this will make you go to the Post Office 100 times for nothing, (2) the authorities will eventually know who has taken the box.
Think it over, whether it would not be better to indicate, as the address, Bibliothèque russe—for the editorial board of the C.
O.
? Let’s think about it.
Nicolet, they say, is incapable of keeping and transmit-ting money, and so forth.
I have written about the order of the articles: send us the proofs as they come in.
Then it will not be necessary to waste two days (that’s terribly long) on sending what has been made up (if it is sent by express, one day is more than enough).
We are waiting impatiently for the proofs.
On Monday, I am lecturing at Montreux, on Tuesday, at Zurich.
I won’t go to Geneva.
Regards and best wishes, Yours, Lenin * Post office box.

I have just received your letter.
As regards Jaurès and Frank, we shall postpone it for a while.
We have to wait.
No point in just censuring them.
And there is nothing to praise them for.
We have decided to keep quiet for a while.
What about the proofs? Will it always take that long? The last No.

SHLYAPNIKOV November 14, 1914 Dear Friend, I am very glad to hear from you that the C.
O.
has been received, and is to go where it should.
As regards your speech at the congress of the Swedish Social-Democrats, I can advise only this: either no speech at all, or a statement that you greet the fraternal party of the Swedish workers and wish it every success in the spirit of revolutionary international Social-Democracy.
337 If you cannot say this, then it is not worth while speaking at all.
But if possible, of course, it would be best to add (1) that the Russian workers have expressed their view through the Social-Democratic Duma group, which did not vote for the budget, (2) that they are issuing illegal leaflets in St.
Petersburg, Riga, Moscow and the Caucasus, (3) that the organs of their Party, the C.
C.
and the C.
O.
, have declared against international opportunism.
Is this “done ” ?—H’m.
.
.
.
Of course, Branting won’t like it, but it’s not our business to “please” the opportunists.
If you are given 10-12 minutes and freedom of speech, then you should speak against German (and other) opportunism, without, of course, in any way touching either the Swed-ish Social-Democrats or their “Young”, and so forth.
As regards restoring the International, I would advise you not to say anything, either directly or indirectly.
I am sending you an article (a very good one!) on this theme (translate it and send it to Russia).
338 We shall keep silent on the question of restoring the International, and stay on the side lines.
We must bide our time.
The Leftists 339are beginning to stir among the Germans: if they have a split, then, maybe, the International will be saved from rotting.
As regards the watchword of “peace”, you are mistaken if you think the bourgeoisie doesn’t even want to hear of it.
Today I have been reading the English Economist.
The wise bourgeois of an advanced country are for peace (of course, in order to strengthen capitalism).
340 But we must not let ourselves be confused with the petty-bourgeois, sentimental liberals, etc.
The epoch of the bayonet has begun.
This is a fact; consequently, we have to fight with such a weapon too.
One of these days, the slogan of peace will be taken up by the German bourgeoisie, and particularly by the op-portunists.
We must stand for the watchword of the revo-lutionary proletariat, capable of fighting for its own aims— and that is civil war.
This too is a very concrete watchword, and it alone unerringly reveals the main trends: either for the proletarian, or for the bourgeois cause.
As regards the debt to the Swedes, 341 neither I nor Na-dezhda Konstantinovna can remember anything at all.
But it is quite possible that either I did not know, or have for-gotten.
It would be a very good thing, therefore, to send them a friendly letter of thanks, suggesting that the debt should be “donated”.
I think you yourself could do this, on behalf of the Petrograd Committee, for example, plus some Social-Democratic deputies, authorising you in Pet-rograd.
I believe this would be the best form.
I think you should act in the same way on the loan.
I would not advise pushing a letter from me (it could start “factional” squabbles!).
I will send a letter if you insist, but my ad-vice is: don’t.
Without me they will be better inclined to give, really! Refer to Petrovsky, get a letter from him (if need be), this is better, really! All the very best, Yours, N.
Lenin P.
S.
If Kollontai translates the Central Committee ma-nifesto (from No.
33 of the C.
O.
) into German, perhaps you will send us a copy?P.
S.
About the “peace” watchword.
An interesting arti-cle by Bernstein in the last issue of Neue Zeit shows that in Britain, where the bourgeoisie is cleverest and freest of all, etc.
, there is a trend for peace from the standpoint of ultra-opportunism.
That is, peace is the best guarantee of “social peace”, i.
e.
, the submission of the proletariat to the bourgeoisie, the pacification of the proletariat, the continuation of the existence of capitalism.
Bernstein’s article does not elaborate this.
But it is ob-vious that there are many such peacemakers among the liberal and radical bourgeois of all countries.
Add to this (1) that all chauvinists are also for peace (only on what terms)—and in the legal press, we shall not be allowed to speak of our terms! (2) that the German and Russian Courts are also for a particular kind of peace with each other (in secret today, half-open tomorrow), (3) that all the sen-timental bourgeois and philistines are “for peace” from the “anti-revolutionary”, philistine, slavish, etc.
, stand-point.
The question is, who objectively now benefits from the watchword of peace? In any case, not the propaganda of the ideas of the revolutionary proletariat! Not the idea of utilising the war to hasten the collapse of capitalism! Add to this the victory of the opportunist chauvinists in nearly all countries: the slogan of peace will only help them to extricate themselves.

It will be a bad blow if it is true! But all the more impermissible in that case will be your departure for Denmark.
In any case, I protest energetically against such a departure.
This is the time for you to be in Stockholm personally, in order to establish better, more frequent and more extensive contacts.
This is a difficult job, it requires an experienced person, with a knowledge of at least one foreign language.
It cannot be left just to “anyone” to look after.
If you are pressed (by the police) in Stockholm, you should hide in some village near Stockholm (this is easily done, they have telephones everywhere).
I think Kollontai, too, could soon easily come to Stockholm or to some subur-ban place, incognito.

; but of course the more connections we have with representatives of the Left wing of the International, the better.
I quite agree with you that these representatives ought to keep closer together, and take common counsel.
And it is with this end in view that I take advantage of your kind letter to continue the conversation you began.
You don’t seem to agree with the slogan of civil war quite fully, but assign to it, one might say, a subordinate (and, I think, even conditional) place, behind the slogan of peace.
And you emphasise that “we need to put forward a slogan that would unite everyone”.
Let me say frankly that what I fear most at present is just this kind of blanket unification which, I am convinced, is the most dangerous and the most harmful thing for the proletariat.
After all, Kautsky has already invented, in Neue Zeit, an ultra-“unifying ” theory, 345 which.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear Friend, I (and Nadezhda Konstantinovna) have had a letter from Kollontai.
We are going to reply to her.
My letters to you, I am sure, are being lost or delayed: I have written more than once through Kobetsky.
Inquire once again.
We have received your manuscript, and intend to publish it in the C.
O.
(or as a pamphlet).
350 Do you read Golos? It already shows signs of Martov’s turnabout 351 —Axelrod’s efforts to “reconcile” (Martov with Südekum, i.
e.
, Plekhanov)—and next to that Trotsky “against” an “amnesty”! What a mess! And they dare abuse us for “factionalism” (while making peace with social-chauvinism for the sake of factionalism!).
An unpleasant and tiresome picture.
If you attend the conference, 352 be on your guard.
If you do speak, I advise you to repeat your Stockholm speech, adding that the entry of the Belgians and the French into the government is also betrayal (even if with extenuating circumstances).
Otherwise they will think that out of Rus-sian chauvinism we are abusing only the Germans.
In my opinion it is not worth while sending a report, it should not be done.
What should be done, for information (only)—and on behalf of Litvinov (Litvinoff.
76.
High Street.
76.

)—is to send a full translation of the manifesto and of the report of the arrest of the 5 (and the 11).
I hope you have already had an exchange of letters with Litvinov? All good wishes, Yours, LeninP.
S.
What did Kollontai think of the “document” 353 and the latest issues (80-86 and the following) of Golos? P.
S.
I have just read that the conference is to take place on January 17, and that the Swiss Party has refused.
I think that, if that is the case, it is better not to participate at all.

KARPINSKY January 3, 1915 Dear Friends, Many thanks for your greetings, and from all of us also (from Nadezhda Konstantinovna and me in particular) best wishes for the new year! A Paris compositor has offered to come to Geneva and set the C.
O.
for 35 francs an issue, if we find a printing press which will provide him with the type.
355 Discuss this from all points of view (reduction of expenses is desirable, because we have decided to publish the C.
O.
weekly) and reply as soon as you can.
Furthermore, consider also when the material should be sent in, by what day everything should be ready and for what day publication should be timed in the interests of circulation.
It would seem that the most convenient day for circulation is Saturday.
If so, should it be published on Wednesday or Thursday? So that we should have it here on Friday, and the whole of Switzerland by Saturday.
All the best, Yours, Lenin Sent from Berne to Geneva First published in 1 9 2 9 in Lenin Miscellany XI Printed from the originalTO THE EDITORIAL SECRETARY OF GRANAT PUBLICATIONS January 4, 1915 Dear Colleague, I received your letter yesterday and sent a telegram “consens”—agreed.
However sad it is that the editors struck out everything about socialism and tactics (without which Marx is not Marx), I had to agree all the same, because your argument (“absolutely impossible”) could not be gainsaid.
356 I shall be very grateful if you send me a proof, or drop me a postcard about when it could be expected.
By the way, is there still time for some corrections to the section on dialectics? Perhaps you will be so kind as to let me know when it is being sent for setting, and what the deadline is for corrections.
It is a question I have been working on these last six weeks, and I think I could add something if there is still time.
Then I would like to offer my services to the editors of the dictionary, if there are still any unallotted articles in the volumes to be published.
I am now in exceptionally good conditions as regards German and French libraries, to which I have access in Berne—and in exceptionally bad conditions as regards literary work in general.
Therefore I would be very glad to take on articles on questions of polit-ical economy, politics, the labour movement, philosophy, etc.
My wife has written on education, as N.
Krupskaya, in Russkaya Shkola and Svobodnoye Vospitaniye, 3 5 7 and has made a particular study of the question of the “Labour School” and the old pedagogical classics.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear Friend, We have once more decided (after having a talk yester-day with Grimm, by the way) to advise you not to attend the council of the heathen: let the liquidators attend the Copenhagen conference, if they like.
We should do better not to take part at all.
Even the Swiss are not going.
This appears to be an intrigue of the Germans.
I even think that it involves an intrigue of the German General Staff, who want to probe for “peace” through others.
We shall learn nothing there.
Nothing much can be done there.
All we need is to send in the manifesto.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear Friend, Your plan for a trip in April and preparations for it seems to be completely correct.
360 You are right: that is the plan to adopt and prepare as systematically and in as much detail as possible.
Thank you for your letters.
We have written to you several times.
We have also sent notepaper with our stamp, I hope you have received all this.
Today we received an issue of Nashe Slovo, which has begun to appear in Paris instead of Golos, which was closed down.
The issue of Nashe Slovo contains a statement by Martov (and Dan) on their differences with Nasha Zarya.
Evidently, there is a big cleavage among them (the liquidators), and no one can say what will happen.
Axelrod is clearly trying to “reconcile” the German (and Bundist) chauvinists with the Francophiles (and Plekhanov).
After Zurich, Martov sang to Axelrod’s tune, but whether he is now “gone left” for long, we don’t know.
In a few days we shall be issuing No.

This year, the demonstration of the international proletarian movement takes place during the greatest European war.

Perhaps nothing can be done in 1915 for “a review of forces”? for comparing “successes and defeats”? for con-trasting the bourgeois world and the proletarian world?— since the appearance=all has collapsed.

But this is not so.
War= the greatest possible crisis.
Every crisis means (with the possibility of temporary re-tardation and regress) (α) acceleration of development (γ) (β) sharpening of contradictions (β) (γ) their exposure (δ) collapse of all that is rotten, etc.

The question boils down to a struggle for reforms.
This struggle is legitimate and necessary within definite limits, viz.

1 Printed from the originalTO KARL RADEK Werter Genosse, * Our letters evidently crossed.
At the same time that you were writing to me, I was writing (a postcard) to you and sending you the Miscellany.
365 I hope you have received it.
About a conference of the Left: I have not been a member of the International Socialist Bureau since 191 (since 1912 Maximovich, in London, has been the C.

’s member of the I.
S.
B.
).
But, of course, Gri-gory and I here will do everything necessary on behalf of the C.
C.
You write that “Grimm macht das [behind the backs of the C.
C.
?] ohne Absicht” ** 366.
.
.
.
I wonder! Es scheint mir wenig glaubhaft zu sein.
Ist Grimm wirklich ein Kind? Nach zwei Konferenzen in Bern? *** 367 But you in Berne, of course, can see it more clearly, and I should be glad if it turned out that I was wrong and you were right.
And so, if Grimm macht das ohne Absicht, then the thing is simple: Grimm must write to the C.

(Of course, it is also possible to write to my address; this will be more direct.
) * Dear Comrade.
—Ed.
** Grimm is not doing this deliberately.
—Ed.
*** I think this is highly unlikely.
Is Grimm really a child? After two conferences in Berne?—Ed.
**** For the Central Committee.
—Ed.
Unless he does this, Grimm will be acting dishonestly (for to write to Maximovich in London means losing time and risking the letter falling into the wrong hands: the police will intercept it!).
It is unbecoming for us to ask for an invitation: we don’t want to force ourselves on them.
We cannot do this! Now on the substance of the question.
You write: “Da wird Grimm und vielleicht [<< sicher meines Erachtens!] auch andere die Sache so abwechseln [nur< richtiger: zertre-ten und verraten!] wollen, dass nur ein Aktionsprogramm [soll heissen: Ermattungsprogramm, a programme of aban-doning the struggle, a programme of discouraging the work-ers from revolution, a programme of pacifying the workers with Leftist phrases] für die Stunde kommt.
”* My opinion is that the “swing” by Kautsky& Bernstein & Co.
(& 500& 1,000& ??) is a swing of shit (= Dreck), who have sensed that the masses won’t stand for it any longer, that it’s “necessary” to make a turn to the left, in order to continue swindling the masses.
368 This is clear.
Renaudel in l’Humanité is also “going left”! These shit-heads will get together and say that they are “against the August 4 policy”, that they are “for peace”, “against annexations” and .
.
.
and .
.
.
thereby will help the bourgeoisie to damp down the incipient revolutionary mood.
I conclude from your letter that you share my views.
Ergo**, our programme should be: (1) to go if invited; (2) to bring together beforehand the “Left”, i.
e.
, the sup-porters of revolutionary action against their own govern-ments; (3) to put before the Kautskian shit-heads our draft resolution (the Dutch 369 & ourselves& the Left Germans &0, and that won’t be too bad, for later it will be not zero, but everyone!); * In that case, Grimm and possibly (I think, surely) others as well will want to try and turn things in such a way (only? more likely: to suppress and betray!) that now only one programme of action (rather: a programme of exhaustion.
.
.
) will be put for-ward.
—Ed.
** Hence.
—Ed.
(4) to put forward 2 or 3 speakers at the conference (if you manage to get there, this will be possible).
Would it be possible to get together a few German Left-wingers against Kautsky and Co.
, for a programme of this kind? Write what you think of this programme.
Its essence= against the stupid and treacherous slogan of peace.

But why should not a Stern group, consisting of X&Y&Z, come forward with resolutions or a manifesto? And then privately and secretly distribute them?) I don’t understand how you missed the Vorkonferenz in Berne!? And you were the one who was exhorting me!? Yours, Lenin P.

374 It would be extremely important for us to have a private consultation with some of the German Left.
Could you organise this? By the way, why not come over here? Written on July 1 5 , 1 9 1 5 Sent from Sörenberg to Berne First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIV Printed from the originalTO KARL RADEK Dear Comrade Radek, I have received your letter to Wijnkoop, and am sending it off by the first post.
I am adding that work should be started right away, if the idea is to prepare a declaration (to say nothing of another Communist Manifesto).
We have provided (1) a manifesto; (2) resolutions; (3) a draft declaration.
375 So let us have your amendments or counterdrafts as soon as possible.
Hurry! Or we shall be late! I personally am against Nashe Slovo participating, but would not make this an ultimatum.
Why am I against? (1) It is corruption, because Nashe Slovo has not itself declared that it is an independent or third (apart from the C.
C.
and O.
C.
) party or group for work in Russia; (2) There are O.
C.
supporters in Nashe Slovo in numbers un-known to the public.
This is dual representation! (O.
C.
& Nashe Slovo).
(3) Nashe Slovo is for the Chkheidze faction in the Duma (and the O.
C.
and Plekhanov&Alexinsky are also for it).
Isn’t that corruption? Taking Lichtstrahlen as a group, and considering it more important than Zetkin’s, is not funny.
This group includes Borchardt&Radek&contributors to Lichtstrahlen.
That is enough.
This group has a little journal (while Zetkin and Co.
haven’t got one).
Borchardt was the first to say publicly: Die Sozialdemo-kratie abgedankt.
* 376 That was not propaganda but a most important political act.
It was action, and not promise.
* The Social-Democrats recanted.
—Ed.
The most important thing for us (i.
e.
, all the Left) is a clear, complete, precise Prinzipienerklärung.
* Without this all the so-called programmes of action are nothing but talk and deception.
What did the Zetkin “resolution of action” in Berne come to? Nothing in terms of action! Nothing in terms of principle! 377 The Borchardt group, if it comes forward (together with us or separately) as an anonymous group (Stern, or Pfeil, or whatever) with a clear-cut Prinzipienerklärung&a call to revolutionary action, will play an outstanding part in world history.
Meanwhile, Zetkin and Co.
, having everything in their hands (newspapers, journals, connections with Berner Tag-wacht, the opportunity of visiting Switzerland, etc.
), have done nothing in 10 months to unite the international Left.
This is a disgrace.
All the best, Yours, Lenin P.
S.
I advise you not to enlist.
It’s stupid to help the enemy.
You will be doing a service to the Scheidemanns.
Better emigrate.
Really, that will be better.
There is now a desperate need of Left-wing workers.
“The opposition in Germany is the product of ferment among the masses, whereas the Bolsheviks represent the orientation of a little group of revolutionaries.
” That is not the Marxist approach.
It is Kautskianism—or a dodge.
What was the 1847 Communist Manifesto and its group? The product of ferment among the masses? Or the orienta-tion of a little group of revolutionaries? Or both the one and the other? And what are we, the Central Committee? Or hasn’t the R.

Duma group proved that there are links with the masses? And what about the Petrograd Proletarsky Golos? Or is there no “ferment among the masses” in Russia? The Left in Germany will make a historic mistake if, on the pretext that they (they= Zetkin, Laufenberg, * Statement of principles.
—Ed.
Borchardt; Thalheimer, Duncker! Ha, ha!) are “the product of ferment among the masses”, they refuse to come forward with a Prinzipienerklärung (anonymously, on behalf of a Stern group, etc.
Later the workers will support it and think about it).
There is need for a Left statement and programme so as to develop the “ferment among the masses”.
It is necessary because of such ferment.
It is necessary so as to transform the “ferment” into a “movement”.
It is necessary so as to develop “ferment” in the rotten International.

You didn’t say clearly in your letter to Wijnkoop whether it was set or proposed for August 20.
Drop me and Grigory a line about this (if it is urgent).
Rakovsky (see his pamphlet) 378 is for defence of the fatherland.
To my mind, we should part company with such people.

The attached footnote to the manifesto should go into the pamphlet.
Insert it, please.
Footnote.
The demand for a United States of Europe, as put forward in the manifesto of the C.
C.
, which sup-plemented it with a call for the overthrow of the mon-archies of Russia, Austria and Germany, differs from the pacifist reading of this slogan by Kautsky and others.
[To the paragraph in the manifesto of the C.
C.
(No.
33 of Sotsial-Demokrat) containing a reference to the United States of Europe.
] There is an editorial in No.
44 of our Party’s Central organ, Sotsial-Demokrat, which shows that the “United States of Europe” slogan is economically wrong.
Either this is an impossible slogan under capitalism, one signify-ing not only the giving up of colonies, but also the estab-lishment of a balanced world economy, with the colonies, spheres of influence, etc.
, divided among the several countries.
Or else it is a reactionary slogan, signifying a temporary alliance between the Great Powers of Europe to plunder the more rapidly developing Japan and America.

384 It would be extremely important to have our pamphlet in German appear before that date.
385 Can you help in this? —first, by calling on Radek, helping him to read the manuscript and inciting him to sit down and do the translation (unfortunately, we shall not manage to have the Russian proofs before then); —second, by seeing to the contract with the German printing house (Radek knows what this is about); —third, by calling on Kinkel, showing him this letter and asking him to help with the translation (to take on part of it).
I know that Kinkel almost hates me for my translation requests.
But this is an emergency, the matter is important, we need urgent help, and maybe he won’t be too angry.
Drop me a reply by postcard as quickly as you can.

Things are now going forward from the other side, so to speak.
It is not a preliminary conference, but an international con-ference of the Left that has been set for Sept.
5.
Merrheim will be there from Paris (all this is entre nous, of course).
The Nashe Slovo people will attend.
Why should not Golay and Maine be there as representatives of Left-wing social-ism in French Switzerland (since Grimm, who is much more half-and-half than Naine and Golay, will be attending)? 389 Please, try and see both as soon as possible, have a good heart-to-heart talk with them, and drop me a line in reply, as soon as you can, about the frame of mind of both these Leftist Frenchmen.
You realise, of course, that it is anti-chauvinist Frenchmen who would just now—especially in the presence of Merrheim—be of particular importance at the conference.
So, hurry with your reply! Regards to Rivlin.
Yours, Lenin Written after August 1 9 , 1 9 1 5 Sent from Sörenberg to Lausanne First published in 1 9 3 0 in Lenin Miscellany XIV Printed from the originalTO ALEXANDRA KOLLONTAI Dear Alexandra Mikhailovna, It will be a great pity if your trip to America finally falls through.
We pinned many hopes on this visit: for the publi-cation in the U.
S.
A.
of our booklet (Socialism and War, which you will receive in a few days), for connections with the publisher Charles H.
Kerr 390 in Chicago in general, for mobilising the internationalists and lastly for the finan-cial help which we so badly need for all those vital affairs in Russia of which you write (and justly emphasise their urgency, in view of the desirability of our coming closer to Russia.
The obstacles there are chiefly financial, and also of a police nature; can one get there safely?).
If the question of a trip has been finally decided in the negative sense, try and think over whether you could (through connections with Charles H.
.
Kerr, etc.
) help us to publish our booklet in English? This can be done only in America.
We are sending you the German edition of our booklet.
Do everything you can for its sale in the Scandinavian coun-tries (it is terribly important for us to cover some of the expenses at least, otherwise we cannot publish it in French!).
Write in greater detail, more concretely and more frequent-ly (if you are not going to America) about the practical questions arising in Russia, who is raising them, how, on what occasions and in what circumstances.
All this is of extreme importance for the publication of leaflets—a vital question, as you rightly say.
About the conference of the Left (where we rallied well as an opposition, although we did sign the manifesto) you will be partly informed by thedelegate you sent, 391 and partly we shall later tell you in writing.

I have not had any cases before this of unregis-tered letters being lost in Switzerland.
Could there be some mistake? Perhaps someone has received these articles in your absence? Write about this, please.
If the answer is that there was, not, and could not have been any mistake, and if you do not have the articles, I will naturally do every-thing possible to get them for you (if I have lost them).
I shall either buy this issue, or (if it has been sold out) get it from the library and make a complete copy for you.

SHLYAPNIKOV September 19 Dear Alexander, We have received your letters telling us about the good working of the transport arrangements, and were extreme-ly glad of them.
As regards the literature at Vardö, try to get hold of and save everything: send us the files of Proletary and Vperyod; we can also make use of the pamphlets (the old ones, of 1905); it will be worth while sending them to Russia, now that there is a possibility of transport in general.
408 Yesterday I read in the foreign press the news of the “dis-persal” of the Duma.
It is clear that the reactionaries are either frightened by the bloc of the Left, or are banking on some “military” chances (perhaps a separate peace?).
Our attitude to the chauvinist revolutionaries (like Keren-sky and part of the Social-Democrat liquidators or patriots) cannot, in my opinion, be expressed by the formula of “sup-port”.
The gulf between the chauvinist revolutionaries (revolution for victory over Germany) and the proletarian internationalist revolutionaries (revolution to awaken the proletariat of other countries, to unite it in a general pro-letarian revolution) is too wide for there to be any question of support.
We must utilise every protest (even a timid and muddled one, à la Gorky), we shall utilise the revolu-tionary work of the chauvinists too, and depending on the circumstances shall not reject “joint action” (in keeping with our Party’s resolutions adopted in 1907, at the Lon-don Congress, and in 1913, at our conference), 409 but noth-ing beyond that.
At the moment, in practice: we shall not issue joint appeals and manifestos with the revolutionarypatriots, we shall avoid Duma “blocs” with them, avoid “unity” with them when speaking at congresses, during demonstrations and the like.
But technical mutual services, if the patriots go along, will probably be possible (as with the liberals before 1905), and we shall not reject them.
Our relations must be straightforward and clear-cut: you want to overthrow tsarism for victory over Germany, we want to do so for the international revolution of the proletariat.
We have incredibly little information from Russia.
It is simply a shame that such a comparatively simple business as conspirative correspondence with Russia (fully possible even in wartime) turns out to be so very badly organised.
This is one of the most essential things.
(I hope you have had a detailed discussion of this with Nadezhda Konstanti-novna in your letters, and will do so yet as circumstantially as possible.
) The most vital thing is to establish regular contact, to bring over from Russia at least two or three leading workers, if only to Sweden, for the most detailed talks and correspondence, in order to reach complete “harmony”.
I hope Belenin’s visit will bring a marked improvement in this sphere.
To do the round trip fast, to establish new connections, to collect the news—that is now the key to the whole of our work, and without it it’s no use even looking to the future.
410 We are thinking over a plan to publish manifestos and leaflets for transportation to Russia.
We have not yet de-cided where they are to be published, here or in the Scandi-navian countries.
We should select the cheapest alternative, because the distance does not matter.

TO KARL RADEK Dear Radek, Thanks for the bulletin.
411 We shall discuss the money question with Grigory.
We’re hard up just now! But the most important thing is: why are you silent about our (your final) draft resolution 4 1 2 ? I must have it at once (and our statement on the voting for the manifesto)! You should have a copy! Why don’t you send it to me? Or Grimm? Can he really be refusing to let you make a copy? Please reply.
Grimm’s “loyalty ” is only so much talk.
He has delib-erately failed to mention Borchardt—it’s a disgrace.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear Alexander, It is a very good thing that you are undertaking to handle the leaflets.
414 We are drawing up a detailed plan for them, and will soon be sending it to you and to N.
I.
But you know it is still most desirable that N.
I.
should write the leaflets in two copies simultaneously (with a copying-pencil over carbon paper), and that you (or he himself) should send us the second copy at once.
For leaflets are a very responsible thing, and the most difficult of all forms of lit-erature.
It is essential therefore to give them most careful thought, and to have collective consultations.
In view of the slowness of setting up, printing and transport, the time lost on dispatch here will be relatively small, and, in any case, does not matter in comparison with the importance of well-thought-out appeals.
How do you plan to sign the leaflets? You have forgotten to write about this.
Kollontai’s pamphlet has a good underlying idea.
But the subject is exceptionally difficult; it is extremely hard to present it on this popular level.
I think it needs correct-ing.
I have already written to her about this, asking her to agree to these corrections.
415 If she does, things will go ahead very quickly, for I have already prepared a draft of the corrections.
As regards a visit to your country, 416 there is a hitch, first, because of lack of finance (the fare is high, and the cost of living there) and, second, because of the dubious police situation.
We shall rather await Belenin’s return and his news of home.

418 Radek does not reply! And I must have them for the Central Organ.

We are told that she has a good command of French.
Will she undertake to translate from German into French (for Roland-Holst’s magazine, published here with our partici-pation 424 )? Free of charge or for a fee? How much? Find out, please.

1916 TO HENRIETTE ROLAND-HOLST Dear Comrade, Comrade Radek has just shown us Comrade Pannekoek’s letter and the “Introduction”.
This letter and the “Introduction” substantially change the previously adopted constitution of Vorbote.
425 It had been agreed that Vorbote would appear as the organ of two groups, namely, (1) the Roland-Holst and Trotsky group (or Roland-Holst and her friends without Trotsky, if Trotsky is unwilling to join); (2) the Zimmerwald Left group (whose bureau consists of three comrades: Radek, Lenin and Zinoviev).
Comrade Pannekoek was appointed representative of the latter group.
Now the above-mentioned documents (the letter and the “Introduction”) change the constitution: Vorbote ap-pears as the organ of two comrades, Pannekoek and Roland-Holst.
If Comrades Pannekoek and Roland-Holst have decided to make this change, we take note of it.
The owner of Vorbote had the full right to do so.
We do not refuse to co-operate in these new conditions, but must require certain guarantees.
Vorbote appears for the first time as the organ of the Zimmerwald Left or “on the platform of the Zimmerwald Left”.
We were elected representatives of that Left by all the members of the Zimmerwald Left attending at Zimmerwald (except Plat-ten).
We think therefore—and in this respect we have all three come to a unanimous decision—that this guarantee is self-evident, and will undoubtedly be given by you.
The guarantee consists in this, that if there are any differ-ences of principle among us, the article which .

KHARITONOV Dear Comrade, I should very much like to go to Zurich for two or three weeks to work in the libraries on a piece of research.
426 My wife also.
So far we have no papers, but hope soon to get them.
The question is whether we shall be able to overcome the financial difficulties.
I would very much ask you to reply frankly and without exaggeration to the following questions: (1) What net income can there be (i.
e.
, for me) from a lecture? Minimum and maximum? The subject: “Two Internationals”: the growing division and rupture with the social-chauvinists throughout the world.
Is it possible to increase the income by giving two lectures, and by how much? 427 (2) Will the local comrades help the two of us to get cheap accommodation? (3) How much will it cost to have a room (for two, even if with a single bed) per week? The cheapest, preferably in a worker’s family? (4) Dinner in a canteen, if there is one (here we pay 65 centimes in a students’ canteen)? (5) Morgenkafee and coffee in the evening, because, of course, we cannot do our own house-keeping in Zurich? The cost of the journey will be 7 8 4 = 2 8 francs; extra expenditure on living in another town? That is the question.
The room situation here is bad.
Do you happen to know a worker’s family which could reliably promise to put us up cheap? I shall be very grateful for a frank reply, but without any wild promises.
Beste Grüsse, Yours, Lenin P.

KHARITONOV Dear Comrade, I am very grateful for your speedy and detailed reply.
We shall be there on February 4.
If you can, find us a room for two, by the week, not dearer than 1 franc a day; pref-erably in an ordinary working-class family (with a stove; it may still be cold).
If this is impossible, perhaps you will recommend a cheap hotel (1 franc a day, or even cheaper), where we could stay until we found a room ourselves.
We shall agree on the date of the lecture, etc.
I hope to have a money order from you on Monday morn-ing (keep a special account of the expenses: the express and the like, and postal expenses generally, etc.
, because we shall cover them ourselves).

Gorky Dear Alexei Maximovich, I am sending you under registered cover my wife’s book-let, Public Education and Democracy.
428 The author has long been studying educational questions, over twenty years.
The booklet is based both on her per-sonal observations and on material about new educational developments in Europe and America.
From the contents you will see that the first half also contains a sketch of the history of democratic views.
This is also very impor-tant, because the views of the great democrats of the past are usually set forth wrongly, or from the wrong stand-point.
I don’t know whether you are able yourself to take time off to read it, or whether you are interested; §§ 2 and 12 could serve as an example.
Changes in education in the latest, imperialist, epoch are sketched out on the basis of material of recent years, and shed some very interesting light on the question for the democrats in Russia.
You will do me a great favour by helping—directly or indirectly—to publish this booklet.
The demand in Rus-sia for literature in this sphere has now probably greatly increased.
Best regards and wishes, V.

429 Send everything to it, please.
We have taken the premises for a month.
On Thursday (Feb.
17) I am giving the first lecture here (“Two Interna-tionals”), and after a while, the second (“Conditions of Peace and the National Question”, or something of that kind).
Please write and tell me when it will be possible to give a lecture (the first, or both?) in Geneva, and whether the cost can be covered.
How much will it yield net, as a mini-mum? I have to know this, because I am very short of money, and I must calculate as carefully as possible wheth-er I should travel from here (at greater expense) or later on from Berne (I can stay more than a month here, if I like it).
I shall await detailed and authoritative instructions from you.
Perhaps you would drop a line to Lausanne, too, to find out whether it is worth while going there for an evening? Best wishes, and regards to V.

I am busy here on February 25 and 26.
So will you please fix the day for the lecture yourself, either before the 25th or after the 26th, and let me know beforehand? 430 I would also ask you very much to write to Lausanne, so that I could have done with the lot in days, i.
e.
, lecture in Lausanne either on the evening before Geneva, or on the day after Geneva.
I accept the subject: “‘Conditions of Peace’ (in quota-tion marks) and the National Question”.
So this is the agreed subject.
All the best.

KARPINSKY Dear V.
K.
, May I trouble you with the following request? I should like to have for my lecture the issue of the Paris Golos (Nashe Slovo’s predecessor) in which Semkovsky replied to me on the question of the self-determination of nations, and in one footnote (I remember that it was a footnote) dealt particularly with the comparison between the right of nations to secede and the right of divorce.
I would return the issue as soon as you required it.
If it is impossible to send it, could the footnote be copied out (it is not very long)? Perhaps you have in your library, or someone else in Geneva has, a file of Golos? I am lecturing here the day after tomorrow, Saturday.
Consequently, if it cannot be sent so as to reach me on Saturday morning, it is not worth while sending it at all.
Regards and au revoir, Yours, Lenin Written on February 2 4 , 1 9 1 6 Sent from Zurich to Geneva First published in 1 9 2 9 in Lenin Miscellany XI Printed from the originalTO SOPHIA RAVICH Dear Comrade, It is impossible to lecture at the club about the con-ference which took place, because this will mean publicity, something the organisers of the conference fear more than anything, and specially asked to avoid in every possible way.
431 Consequently, the subject must be changed.
I haven’t a clear idea of who will be present at the interna-tionalist club, 432 and therefore find it difficult to choose a subject.
I suggest the following: if it is essential to name the subject beforehand, choose some vague title (“Current Affairs ” or “Urgent Problems of the Working-Class Move-ment”, etc.
), so that everything could be brought under it.
Meanwhile I shall take advice in Geneva, and will pre-pare for the morning of the 2nd a small report or opening to a discussion.

M.
, We have received your letter, and once again congrat-ulate you on your success.
I was terribly irritated by the fact that “noble” France had (actually!) confiscated some of my registered letters to you in America.
Well, we can’t help that, can we? Now you must do your very best about contacts with America.
You did write me that while in America you received Internationale Flugblätter No.
1 in German, and that you would try to publish it in English! 434 And now there’s not a word about it? What does it mean?! Is that to say that no sympathisers are to be found in America and that Internationale Flugblätter cannot be published in English? This is incredible! But if that is so, it should be published in Norway (in English).
Would you undertake to translate it, and how much will it cost to publish it? I also wrote to you in America that I had received a Socialist Propaganda League 435 leaflet from Boston, Mass.
(signed by 20 Socialists with addresses, mostly in Massa-chusetts).
This league is internationalist, with a pro-gramme clearly tending to the left.
I sent them the longest letter 436 in English (and Inter-nationale Flugblätter in German).
There has been no reply.
I wonder if “ noble” France has confiscated the lot.
If you received nothing and know nothing about them, I shall send you their address and a copy of my letter.
Will you undertake to send it on to America?And what of the Socialist Labour Party? After all, they are internationalists (even if there is something narrowly sectarian about them).
Have they got their copy of Inter-nationale Flugblätter? Have you any contacts with them? Furthermore, you also wrote that you had started nego-tiations with Charles H.
Kerr.
What’s the result? He did promise to publish a part of our pamphlet (by Lenin and Zinoviev).
Now you say nothing more about it.
.
.
.
How are we to understand this? 437 Internationale Korrespondenz 438 reported that the New Review in America had undertaken to publish articles by the Zimmerwald Left.
Is that true? Do you know the New Review? Reply as soon and as circumstantially as you can.
You will, of course, find out everything in great detail about direct mail steamers from Norway to America.
As for Höglund and the Norwegians, I am still unable to find out whether or not they have received Internationale Flugblätter, whether or not they have published it in Swedish and Norwegian, whether or not they have offi-cially affiliated to the Zimmerwald Left (like the Rev.
Soc.
Verband of Roland-Holst) Please take the trouble to find out, get things done, give them a piece of your mind, make them do it, follow it through! Let Bukharin inform you of the contents of our special letter to him about the Zimmerwald people, and please see that this is done.

, Thank you very much for your letter.
I shall send you the address of the Socialist Propaganda League, unless I have left it behind in Berne: in that case I shall send it over from Berne (i.
e.
, in 2 or 3 weeks’ time).
Do you think Appeal to Reason would refuse to reprint Internationale Flugblätter No.
1 ? Is it worth trying? Will the Socialist Labour Party agree to publish, if we pay the costs? Are these people hopeless sectarians or not? Have you any connections with them? Why don’t they send us copies of their papers in the Internationale Sozialistische Kommission? (I saw some quite by chance.
) Or are they maniacs with an idée fixe about a special “eco-nomic” organisation of workers? You ask how desirable it is that the Norwegian party should send its official representative to the conference.
Of course, it is 1,000 times better to have a class-conscious and intelligent Left-winger from among the youth, than a Right-winger or a 2 -Kautskyite from the party.
That is clear.
Use your influence on these lines, if you can.
I am very much distressed that we do not see eye to eye on self-determination.
Let’s try to argue this out in detail without a squabble (which someone is trying very hard to stir up for us on this score) 439.

TO THE SECOND SOCIALIST CONFERENCE CALLED BY THE I.
S.

(BERNE) 440 THESES ON ITEMS 5, 6, 7a, 7b AND 8 OF THE AGENDA In announcing the convocation of the Second Internation-al Socialist Conference, the I.
S.
C.
published the following major items of the agenda: 5.
“The struggle to end the war” 6.
“Problems of peace” 7a.
Parliamentary “action” “agitation and 7b.
Mass propaganda ” ” 8.
International Socialist Bureau.
The I.
S.
C.
has invited organisations to discuss these questions and send in their propositions.
Here is the response of our Party’s C.
C.
to the invitation: 1.
In the same way as any war is only the continuation by means of force of the policy which the belligerent powers and the ruling classes in them carried on for long years or decades before the war, so peace ending any war can be nothing but an account and a record of the actual changes in strength achieved as a result of that war.
2.
Hence, any talk of assessing a given war on the strength of the “simple” concepts of defence and attack, and of assessing the coming peace on the strength of “simple” high-minded wishes for a stable, democratic, honourable, etc.
, peace, is most absurd and thick-witted, from the standpoint of theory, from the standpoint of socialist doctrine, and is the greatest deception of the working class in practice.
! !!3.
The present war is an imperialist war, i.
e.
, a war born of contradictions on the basis of highly developed, monopoly capitalism, which is ripe for transition to social-ism.
This war is being waged for world hegemony, i.
e.
, for fresh oppression of the weak nations, for another division of the world, the division of colonies, spheres of influence, etc.
—a division in which the old robber powers, Britain, France and Russia, would give up a share of their booty to Germany, a younger and stronger robber power.
4.
Consequently, unless a revolution of the proletariat overthrows the present governments and present ruling classes of the belligerent “Great” Powers, there is abso-lutely no possibility of any other kind of peace, except a more or less brief armistice between the imperialist powers, a peace accompanied by a strengthening of reactionary forces within the states, an intensification of the national oppression and greater enslavement of the weak nations, a growth in the inflammable material preparing the way for new wars, etc.
, etc.
For from the objective content of the policy engendered by the whole epoch of imperialism, the policy carried on by the bourgeoisie of all the warring “Great” Powers both before this war and during it, inevi-tably flows a peace based on a fresh and worse oppression of nations, etc.
5.
To spread among the masses of the people ideas or hopes of the possibility of a stable or democratic, etc.
, peace between the present governments and the present ruling classes (i.
e.
, the bourgeoisie in alliance with the landowners), as most of the official socialist parties are doing, is not only shamelessly to deceive the people, but also to blunt their vigilance and to distract them from the revolutionary struggle, which is already in effect begin-ning as a movement of strikes and demonstrations.
6.
That is just the kind of deception of the people and distraction of the proletariat from the revolutionary strug-gle that is inherent in the “peace programme” now being “unanimously” put forward both by Huysmans, the Second International’s official representative at the congress of the Sozialdemokratische Arbeiter Partei of Holland in Arnhem, 441 and by Kautsky, the most influential theoreti-cian of the Second International and the most influentialdefender of the social-patriots and social-chauvinists of all countries.
Their programme is nothing but verbal and hypocritical recognition of a few democratic pious hopes: rejection of annexations and indemnities, self-determination of nations, democratisation of foreign policy, courts of arbitration to examine disputes between states, disarma-ment, United States of Europe, etc.
, etc.
7.
The most obvious confirmation of the fact that this “peace programme” is sheer hypocrisy is, on the one hand, its verbal acceptance by a number of bourgeois pacifists and ministerial demagogues of the warring countries, and on the other, its repetition by notorious (notorisch) chau-vinists at the conferences of the “socialists”, first of one group of warring powers in London (February 1915) and then of the other in Vienna (April 1915).
442 It is the “so-cialists” who join bourgeois governments engaged in the predatory war, who voted the war credits and assisted the war by taking part in various organisations and in-stitutions, etc.
, who in practice pursue a policy of defend-ing old and new annexations, colonial oppression, etc.
, that now proclaim before the whole world their “peace programme”, consisting of rejection of annexations and so forth.
8.
The highest authority in the Second International, Kautsky, proclaimed to the whole world on May 21, 1915 (Neue Zeit) that the agreement and “unanimity” of “social-ists” in London * and in Vienna, on the principle of the “independence” or self-determination of nations, proves the Second International’s “unanimity” on, and “via-bility” in, its “peace programme”.
443 This defence and sanction of the most crying and most brazen hypocrisy and deception of the workers is by no means an accident, but a systematic policy pursued in a number of countries by men who pretend to be “internationalists”, but actually whitewash the imperialist war by applying to it the idea of “defence of the fatherland”, and strengthen the domina-tion of the labour movement by social-chauvinists, who have betrayed socialism, by preaching “unity” with them.
This policy, which is most harmful and dangerous for the * The MS .
says erroneously “in Copenhagen” .
—Ed.
working class, is being carried on by Kautsky, Haase and others in Germany, Longuet, Pressemane and others in France, most of the leaders in Britain, Axelrod, Martov and Chkheidze and Co.
in Russia, Trèves and others in Italy (see the threat of Avanti!, the Central Organ of the Italian Party, issued on March 5, 1916, to expose Trèves and other “reformist-possibilists” as having “set in motion every possible means to obstruct the action of the party lead-ership and Oddino Morgari towards the Zimmerwald organisation and the new International itself” 444 ).
This world-wide policy, which is most dangerous for the work-ing class, may be called a Kautskian policy, after its most authoritative representative.
9.
Socialists cannot renounce the struggle for reforms.
They must vote, incidentally in parliaments as well, for any, even minor, improvements in the condition of the masses, such as higher aids to the inhabitants of devastated areas, relaxation of national oppression, etc.
But on the basis of the present war and the peace which follows from it, such reformist activity for the improvement of the people’s condition is obviously possible only in minia-ture proportions.
It would be a crying deception of the masses to suggest to them, directly or indirectly, that a reformist solution of the problems raised by the present war is possible.
For this war has brought about a revolu-tionary situation in Europe by making an issue of the most fundamental problems of imperialism, which must needs be solved the imperialist way unless the present governments and ruling classes of Europe happen to be overthrown the revolutionary way.
Therefore, the main and basic task in the struggle for a stable and democratic peace on the part of socialists should be: first, explanation to the masses of the need of revolutionary mass struggle, systematic propaganda of such struggle and the creation of an appropriate organisation; second, exposure of the lies and hypocrisy both of bourgeois-pacifist and socialist, particularly Kautskian, talk about peace and the “unanimi-ty” of the Second International on the “peace programme”.
Such phrases are doubly hypocritical when coming from “socialists” who echo the bourgeoisie in denying any possibility of transforming the present imperialist warinto a civil war for socialism, and who oppose any revolu-tionary activity in this direction.
10.
The central point of the prevailing hypocrisy about a “peace programme” is the allegedly unanimous accept-ance of struggle against old and new annexations.
But those who talk about annexations and the struggle against them are unable, or for the most part unwilling, to think about the meaning of annexation.
It is clear that not every attachment of “foreign” territory can be called annexation, since socialists, generally speaking, are in favour of elim-inating frontiers between nations, the coming together and integration of nations, and the formation of larger states.
It is clear that not every infringement of the status quo can be considered annexation: this would be a most reactionary attitude, and a mockery of the fundamental conceptions of historical science.
It is clear that not every attachment by force, that is, war, can be considered an-nexation, since socialists cannot object to force if it is applied in the interests of the mass of the population and the interests of mankind’s progress.
It is clear that only the attachment of territory against the will of its popula-tion can and must be deemed annexation.
In other words, the concept of annexation is organically bound up with the concept of self-determination of nations.
11.
It is precisely on the basis of the present war, because of the fact that it is imperialist on the part of both groups of warring “Great” Powers, that there was bound to de-velop, and actually did develop, the phenomenon of the bourgeoisie and social-chauvinists intensively “fighting” against “annexations”, if they have been carried out, or are being carried out, by an enemy state.
Südekum and his Austro-German friends and defenders, including Haase and Kautsky, are silent about the annexations carried out by Germany in respect of Alsace-Lorraine, Denmark, Poland, etc.
, but very often “fight against annexations” carried out by Russia in respect of Finland, Poland, Ukraine, the Caucasus, etc.
, by Britain in respect of India, and so forth.
On the other side, the British, French, Italian and Russian Südekums, i.
e.
, Hyndman, Guesde, Vandervelde, Renaudel, Trèves, Plekhanov, Axelrod, Chkheidze and Co.
, are silent about Britain’s annexations in respect of India, France’sin respect of Nice or Morocco, Italy’s in respect of Tripoli or Albania, Russia’s in respect of Poland, Ukraine, etc.
, but then largely “fight against annexations” carried out by Germany.
It is clear that such “struggle against annexations” on the part of the social-chauvinists and Kautskyites is hypocritical through and through, and the bourgeoisie is assisting such struggle directly, by allocating millions upon millions for chauvinist propaganda, and indirectly, by granting a monopoly of legality only to the social-chauvinists and the Kautskyites.
It is clear that both the French “socialists” who justify a war for Alsace-Lorraine, and the German “socialists” who refuse to demand freedom for Alsace-Lorraine to secede from Germany, are equally annexationists, for all their swearing to the contrary.
It is clear that Russian “socialists” who speak or write against the “break-up of Russia”, or, behind the “peace without annexations” slogan, justify, directly or indirectly, the present war over who is to enslave Poland, are just as much annexationists, and so on and so forth.
12.
If socialists are not to transform “the struggle against annexations” into an empty phrase or into revolting hy-pocrisy, they should, first, explain to the masses the need for revolutionary struggle for the conquest of political power by the proletariat and a socialist revolution which springs from all the conditions of the imperialist epoch and the present imperialist war, and which alone can firmly and everywhere ensure the self-determination of nations, i.
e.
, liberate oppressed nations and effect the, coming to-gether and integration of nations, not on the basis of force but on the basis of the equal rights and consent of the proletariat and working people of all nations; secondly, immediately mount the widest propaganda and agitation against the veiled chauvinism and annexationism of the official socialist parties, especially in the “Great” Powers.
Socialists should explain to the masses that the English socialist who does not struggle now for freedom of secession for Ireland, India, etc.
, is a socialist and internationalist only in words, and a chauvinist and annexationist in prac-tice.
The same applies to the French socialist who does not fight for the freedom of the French colonies, againstthe war to annex Alsace-Lorraine, etc.
; the German social-ist who does not fight for freedom of secession for Alsace-Lorraine, the Danes, the Poles, the Belgians, the Serbs and others; the Russian socialist who does not fight for freedom of secession for the Ukraine, Finland, etc.
, and against war over Poland; the Italian socialist who does not fight for freedom of secession for Tripoli, Albania, etc.
; the Dutch socialist who does not fight for freedom of seces-sion and independence for the Dutch East Indies; the Polish socialist who does not fight for full freedom and equality for the Jews and the Ukrainians oppressed by the Poles, and so on.
13.
It inevitably follows from the Zimmerwald mani-festo and the I.
S.
C.
circular of Feb.
10, 1916 (Bulletin No.
3) 445 that all “war on war” and “struggle for peace” are hypocrisy unless they are indissolubly bound up with immediate revolutionary mass struggle, and with its propaganda and preparation.
But this conclusion must be set forth straightforwardly and definitely.
There is need, first, to explain to the masses what the development of the revolutionary mass struggle in the conditions of a European war can and must (muss) lead to.
It leads inevi-tably to the transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war for socialism.
This is hinted at by all the speeches about it being better for the workers to die for their own cause, rather than for someone else’s.
But a hint is insuffi-cient.
The masses should have clearly put before them the great, even though maybe not very immediate, aim.
They should know what direction to take and why.
Second, if we call on the masses to fight their governments “regard-less of the military position of a given country”, we thereby not only reject in principle the admissibility of “defence of the fatherland” in the present war, but recognise the desirability of defeat of any bourgeois government, in order to transform the defeat into a revolution.
And this must be said straightforwardly: revolutionary mass struggle cannot become international unless its class-conscious rep-resentatives openly unite for the purpose of defeating and overthrowing all bourgeois governments.
Third—and this is most important—it is impossible to carry on a revo-lutionary mass struggle without creating everywhere, notonly at the top but also in the midst of the masses, an illegal organisation for its propaganda, preparation and discussion of its course and conditions.
If there have been street demonstrations in Germany, if there have been many letters from the front calling on the people not to subscribe to the war loan in France, if there have been mass strikes in Britain, to say nothing of Russia, then in order to aid this struggle, to unify it on an international scale, it is unquestionably necessary to report every step along this road in a free, i.
e.
, illegal, press, analysing the successes, assessing their conditions, and building up and developing the struggle.
Without an illegal organisation and an illegal press the acceptance of “mass action” will remain an emp-ty phrase (as is the case in Switzerland).
* 14.
On the question of the socialists’ parliamentary struggle (Aktion), it should be borne in mind that the Zimmerwald resolution not only expresses its sympathy with the five Social-Democratic deputies of the Duma, who belong to our Party, and who have been sentenced to exile in Siberia, but also proclaims its solidarity with their tactics.
It is impossible to recognise the revolutionary struggle of the masses and put up with the purely legal, purely reformist activity of socialists in parliaments; this leads only to legitimate dissatisfaction among the work-ers, and their leaving the S.
D.
ranks for anti-parliamentary anarchism or syndicalism.
It is essential to say clearly and publicly that Social-Democrats in parliaments must use their position not only to make parliamentary speeches, but also to give all-round extra-parliamentary assistance to the illegal organisation and revolutionary struggle of the workers, and that the masses themselves must, through their illegal organisation, check up on such activity by their leaders.
15.
The question of convening the International Social-ist Bureau, included in the agenda of the coming Second International Socialist Conference, unavoidably raises the more fundamental question of principle, namely, whether the unity of the old parties and of the Second International is possible.
The wider the sympathy among the masses * Paragraphs 12 and 13 are crossed out in the MS.
—Ed.
for the Zimmerwald organisation, the less understandable for the masses and the more harmful for the development of their struggle is the inconsistency and timidity of the attitude which in essence identifies the old parties and the Second International with bourgeois policy in the working-class movement (see the Zimmerwald manifesto and I.
S.
C.
circular of Feb.
10, 1916), while fearing a split with them, and promising to dissolve the I.
S.
C.
directly the old International Socialist Bureau reassembles.
This promise was not voted upon, and was not even dis-cussed at Zimmerwald.
During the six months since Zimmerwald, it has become even clearer that a split is inevitable, that the work recom-mended by the Zimmerwald manifesto cannot be carried on in unity with the old parties, and that the fear of a split hampers every step on that way.
In Germany it is not only the Internationale Sozialisten Deutschlands group that has condemned the fear of a split, and has openly come out against the hypocrisy of those who preach unity; Otto Rühle, a member of the Reichstagsfraktion and a close associate of Karl Liebknecht, has openly declared for a split.
And Vorwärts has failed to find a single serious or honest argument against Rühle.
In France, Bourderon, a member of the Socialist Party, is against a split in words, but has actually tabled in the Congress a resolution which directly “désapprouve [disapproves] of the C.
A.
P.
[Comité Administratif Permanent= Party Executive] and the G.
P.
” (Groupe Parlementaire= parliamentary group).
The adop-tion of such a resolution would clearly mean an immediate and unquestionable split in the party.
In Britain, T.
Rus-sel Williams, even writing in the moderate Labour Leader, has openly and repeatedly declared the inevitability of a split, and has met with support from some members of his party.
In America, with formal unity in the Socialist Party, some of its members declare for militarism and war (so-called preparedness), and others, among them Eugene Debs, the one-time Socialist candidate for the Pres-idency, openly preach civil war for socialism in connection with the looming war.
There is already an actual split throughout the world, and closing their eyes to this only tends to harm theZimmerwaldists, making them ridiculous in the eyes of the masses, who know perfectly well that each step in their work in the spirit of Zimmerwald means a continuation and widening of the split.
It takes courage openly to recognise what is inevitable and what has taken place, to abandon the harmful illusions about unity being possible with the “defenders of the father-land” in the present war, to help the masses to be rid of the influence of those leaders who are “misleading them” (see the I.
S.
C.
circular of Feb.
10, 1916) or paving the way for a plot (Pakt) against socialism via an “amnesty”.
That is our proposal on the item of the agenda for the calling of the International Socialist Bureau at The Hague.
*** Reformist talk is the main means for deceiving the people at a time when the objective situation has placed on the agenda of history the greatest world crisis, which, regardless of the will of the several parties, can be either evaded or put off until the next imperialist war, or resolved through a socialist revolution.
It is neither an accident nor the ill will of the several governments or capitalists of some country but the whole evolution of bourgeois rela-tions that has led to imperialism and the present impe-rialist war.
Nor is it an accident or the result of some demagogy or agitation but the objective conditions of the wartime crisis and the aggravation of class contradictions that are now giving rise to the strikes, demonstrations and similar other manifestations of mass revolutionary struggle in a number of belligerent countries.
Objectively the question appears in this way—and in no other: either to help this still weak but internally power-ful and deep ferment and movement of the masses, which is potentially capable of developing into a socialist revolu-tion; or to conduct a policy of assisting the bourgeois govern-ments (Durchhaltspolitik, politique jusquauboutiste * ).
The real meaning of the sugary talk about a democratic peace is nothing but assistance to the governments through the hypocritical dulling and duping of the masses.
* Carrying on the war to a victorious end.
—Ed.
*** This war has raised the fundamental questions of impe-rialism, that is, the questions of the very existence of capi-talist society, and it would be quackery to suggest to the people—directly or indirectly—that any reformist solution of these problems is possible.
What is involved here is a fresh division of the world in accordance with the new balance of forces between the capitalist states, which over the last few decades have been developing not only at exceptional speed but—and this is especially im-portant—extremely unevenly.
On the basis of capitalist social relations this redivision of the world is inconceiv-able except through force and war.
The objective state of things rules out any reformist solution for the mature contradictions; it rules out any other way out except a series of imperialist wars or a socialist revolution of the proletariat, for whose success the imperialist epoch itself has already created the conditions.
Real political activity in these conditions is possible only as one of two things: assistance to “one’s own” national bourgeoisie in plunder-ing other countries, or assistance to the incipient.

446 I hope you will make use of all your connections, and do everything possible and impossible to extricate them and help them in every way.
I have decided not to write to Branting, because my recommendation at present in all respects—you will ap-preciate—may do harm.

Please, write as soon as you can whether there is any hope of this (so that we should have time to exchange letters).
Do you read the German Social-Democratic papers? The Braunschweig Volksfreund gave a good answer to Huys-mans, 448 while the Chemnitz Volksstimme, which is an organ of the Right, said it was in complete agreement with Huys-mans’s criticism of the Zimmerwaldists.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear Alexander, The conference is over, its manifesto has been published (May 1).
452 I hope you receive Berner Tagwacht—or some other Swiss paper? If not, drop us a line, and we shall send you the French text.
Grigory is preparing a circumstantial letter about the conference, and this will be sent to you.
After all, a manifesto was adopted: that is a step for-ward, because it was accepted by the French deputies (three, one of them the semi-chauvinist Brizon).
453 A resolution criticising pacifism, and a resolution on the International Socialist Bureau, sharply criticising it, were adopted.
On the whole, this is none the less, despite the mass of defects, a step towards a break with the social-patriots.
This time the Left was stronger: a Serb, three Swiss and a Frenchman (not a deputy; not from any group, but on his own) reinforced our Left.
Then there were two Germans (from the Internationale group) 454 who supported us on the main questions.
Have you seen the Huysmans manifesto? It contains an unmistakable malicious “hint” about us! The Braun-schweig Volksfreund gave him a good answer.
As regards the Japanese, 455 we have decided to make another, and, I hope, final, attempt to reach agreement: (1) all the old agreements (verbal) are cancelled; (2) an agreement between the Central Organ’s editorial board, which edits the issue, and the publishers to be concluded from issue to issue, i.
e.
, for each issue separately; (3) No.
3 to be published at Berne (clearly it is impossible at Stock-holm).
Try and see whether it will come off or not.
If not, we shall publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.
We can’t wait.
456 Here is the plan for No.
3: 1) Material from Russia (up to 3 sheets).
2) Theses of the Central Organ’s editorial board on self-determination.
3) Lenin’s article on the same subject.
4) The 2nd Zimmerwald Conference.
Grigory Zinoviev or Lenin.
5) Bukharin: an economic subject.
6) Lyalin on the high cost of living.
7) Alexander—from Russia.
8) A Serb and an Italian have promised articles.
9) Russian themes—Grigory Zinoviev.
10) Radek—continuation (? hardly worth while.
In my opinion, no).
* 10) Kollontai—from America.
11) A Lett.
12) Varin.
13) The women’s labour movement.
14) Book reviews.
15) About Trotsky, Martov and the Chkheidze group.

G.
SHLYAPNIKOV For Alexander May 23, 1916 Dear Friend, I have only just received from Grigory your letter to him of May 19.
You write that “the correspondence and negotiations with Kommunist have become a terrible bore”.
I quite understand you, but do have patience! You can’t, after all, once you have set about negotiating, have attacks of nerves and fall into despair.
That’s not the proletarian way, really and truly.
You put two questions: (1) to co-opt two more (C.
O.
supporters) to the editorial board; (2) to start a Discussion Section in Kommunist.
On the first point you write: “From conversations with them I realise that they have nothing against it, though of course it grieves them.
” I began thinking about your plan.
I think that to take on non-writers (particularly after all our sad experiments) would be an absolute iniquity, something we could not justify before the Party.
We could, perhaps, find one writer (I have one in my mind; I must find out more about him, and think it over again and again, before saying yes or no).
It’s much harder getting another one.
Could you modify your plan, to make it workable, in this way: either the C.
O.
editorial board co-opts two Party writers, if they are available (then there will be seven); or, if it manages to find only one, the publishers (the Kiev-skys, he and she) delegate one of their number to theeditorial board (then there will be five: Bukharin& a publisher&three here)? (I personally would find the latter particularly suitable, because (a) it would obviate the need to invent editors; (b) it would not reduce the “rights” of the publishers, because it is all the same to have one to one or two to two; (c) it would create an editorial board of writers, which is extremely important in a Party sense, to combat the striv-ing abroad for editorial positions.
) Think it over and reply (if not inconvenient, probe the ground among the publishers).
As regards the Discussion Section, your plan is debatable, if it is implemented in a practical way and if one little thing, which you could not have known of, is eliminated.
In a practical way means laying down precisely who has the right to have a discussion article inserted.
All members of the editorial board.
That is unquestionable.
Is it suffi-cient? I think it is.
The editorial board will consist of five or seven persons.
The “one little thing” is this.
A discussion within the Party.
Undoubtedly.
Well, but what about inflaming differences or opening doors for groups abroad which are not in the Party? This is the point.
The publishers made Kommunist impossible, because they did not want any discussion, they did not write or prepare anything at all for discussion—but played on Radek’s striving to crawl through the cracks of our Party from outside.
Radek and the Nashe Slovo people, and many others among the groups abroad, are simply straining, in the guise of discussion, to bring about divisions amongst us, to blow up discon-tents, and hamper our work (an old game of exiles abroad!).
You may not know that Radek pushed us out of the Vorbote editorial board.
It was initially agreed that there would be a joint editorial board composed of two groups: (1) the Dutch (maybe& Trotsky) and (2) us (i.
e.
, Radek, Grigory and me).
This condition gave us equal rights on the editorial board.
Radek intrigued for months, and got the “missus” (Roland-Holst) to cancel this plan.
We were demoted to the position of contributors.
It’s a fact!Is it proper to reward Radek for this feat by giving him the right to “discuss”, and the publishers, the right to hide behind Radek? That will be not discussion, but dis-sension and intrigue.
(1) Gazeta Robotnicza (February 1916), in which Radek participates, carried some purely factional attacks on us, and a resolution on Nashe Slovo lines.
(2) Now on the question of assessing the Irish in-surrection (a most important question, is it not? Not abstract “theory”!) both Radek 460 and Kulisher (the Cadet in Rech) 461 are in full agreement, stupidly calling it a “putsch”.
This is incredible, but it’s a fact! If, in the guise of “discussion”, the publishers want to provide a platform for all the groups abroad wishing to fight our Party without joining it, that is not discussion, it is a game.
8 If they don’t want this, why not lay down precisely, example, that the right to open discussions is restricted | for (1) to members of the editorial board; (2) to the Party | organisations in Russia; (3) to the C.
O.
A.
, 462 being the 8 organisation of the Party outside Russia? Kommunist was an alliance with the Dutch and Radek.
This alliance has been changed by the fact that we were downgraded in the Dutch-Radek journal from editors to contributors.
So don’t cherish any harmful illusions about the alliance remaining the same! These are harmful illu-sions! We have to go forward ourselves, not allowing our hands to be tied.
Not in any way.
The practical conclusion: think over (and I will think it over and write to Grigory about it) the follow-ing §§: 1) the composition of the editorial board is changed: 5 or 7 (see above); 2) another title is chosen (Sbornik or the like); 8 ^ 3) explicit rules of discussion (e.
g.
, in the spirit of | ; 8 4) Switzerland to be the place of publication (for some reason you don’t mention this point.
Why?); 5) the income is divided in such-and-such a way.
Will the publishers agree to provide 2 for the cost of transportand of maintenance for the organiser of contacts, etc.

SHLYAPNIKOV For Comrade Alexander Dear Alexander, Of course we shall give Belenin 300 kronen, if he has already so firmly decided on his plan for a trip.
It will be a pity if he goes.
In any case, you must do everything to ensure his return in a few months.
As regards the “Japanese”, you shouldn’t think that they have made “considerable concessions” in the draft you have sent on.
They haven’t made any at all! On the contrary, the demand that the two should have the right to haul in dissenting contributors is an innovation, an addition, a surenchère.
And this innovation clearly exposes their “policy” in the worst sense of the word.
If the founders, the publishers, the young contributors want freedom of opinion for themselves—freedom of discussion—that is legitimate.
But if people, behind this legitimate desire, try to smuggle in “discussion” which is not their own, but that of “contrib-utors”, isn’t it clear that this is a game? Never has there been anything like this anywhere.
If the two want publicity for all kinds of intrigues abroad—let them go ahead, and let them be responsible for it.
I cannot participate in this either directly or indirectly.
You will ask, perhaps, where is the proof that it is a question of intrigues abroad? I wrote to you about this long ago, and you have not replied a single time.
The proof is the issue of Gazeta Robotnicza (February 1916), from which we have Radek and Bronski as “contributors”.
That is a fact.
These gentlemen were the first in the Zimmerwald Left to start an intrigue—and at what a time! They want to “play off” Chkheidze and Trotsky.
At such a moment the two publishers do not blush to propose to us that we should give them “freedom and a guarantee” of discussion for such contributors! This is either madness, or the height of impudence.
And equal representation with them (6=3&3), is that not the same thing? Why, they once gave you to understand (and you wrote this yourself) that they would accept the co-opting of two, supporters of the C.
O.
But when it came to having a written agreement, they beat a retreat.
Isn’t that the game of petty hucksters? If people are in agreement, sincerely and in principle, to have a journal or a miscellany support the Programme of the Party, then the majority must be for it.
Otherwise there is no sincerity, no principle, only “the purse strings”.
My view is, explain all this to them clearly, in popular language, if necessary in writing, and give them an ultima-tum: either this way (7=4&3), or you send in your conclu-sion about their “game” to the Bureau.
466 That will be the correct Party reply.

SHLYAPNIKOV Dear Alexander, I wrote to you briefly yesterday.
Today I want to have a further talk.
I am revolted by the “conditions” laid down by the Japa-nese.
That two editors should have the right to decide on inserting an article written for discussion purposes by a contributor! Not even three, but only two: in other words, the publishers “depend” on no one but themselves.
467 The meaning of this clause is clear: they want to hide behind Radek and inflame our differences with him and with the P.
S.
D.
468 This is not discussion, but the height of intrigue, the utmost cravenness.
It’s just as it was in Paris in 1911, when we were “dragged” into a discussion with Rap-poport, or Lyova, or Viktoryonok, or Bogdanov! I have writ-ten to you that the Polish Gazeta Robotnicza (February 1916) is attacking us just like those Parisians did then.
In no circumstances will I join an editorial board which is intriguing in this way, under the guise of discussion.
If you, Japanese, want to help to disorganise our Party, do it on your own responsibility.
Your purse is full.
Go ahead and publish the “discussion” by Radek or Gazeta Robotnicza: then the Russian workers will see at once that you are in-triguers, and will kick you out.
But you want to play this mean trick under cover of a “collective board”.
Sorry, but I won’t accept this and will expose you.
That is my reply to the Japanese on this question.
The same goes for “equal rights” (the elimination of the seventh member, or voting on him).
469 This is a continua-tion of the old “game”.
What has Party membership got to do with it? The point is that we are to give “equal rights”to people who have shown themselves in the negative! Why should we? Equal rights= the right to spoil the work! In the name of what? For what purpose? To make dissension permanent? No.
If they want to make a new experiment, we shall take a new journal, or more precisely miscellany, and try (the old confidence has been undermined) to issue one with an editorial board of seven.
We shall make the experiment: this is the maximum concession which I can conscientiously allow.
If the experiment fails, the intriguers and the capi-talists lose nothing, because the “purse” can always be with-drawn.
And we shall then issue our own miscellany.
One that is simple, clear and without intrigue.
I wish you all the best, and ask you to be patient.

SHLYAPNIKOV June 17, 1916 Dear Friend, Nadezhda Konstantinovna is writing to you about other matters, but I will reply to your P.
S.
to me.
You write that “our people have no evil intentions”, and you add that for the Kievskys “it’s a matter of the national question alone, and that they write the articles them-selves”.
If that were the case, why then have a paragraph in the Rules about the right of discussion for contributors on the demand of two (note: not even three, but two, i.
e.
, distrust of Bukharin on the part of the Japanese)? In that event, this paragraph would have no meaning.
And it is a thing without precedent for two editors out of six or seven to de-mand “freedom” of discussion (alleged discussion) not for themselves, but for contributors.
No.
The Japanese woman cannot insert meaningless paragraphs into the Rules.
The meaning of this paragraph is just this, and only this, that our hands are being tied, and we find ourselves helpless against the striving of the Poles to start an intrigue.
You write that you have not seen Gazeta Robotnicza (you should have been sent it, and also the C.
O.
A.
resolution adopt-ed with the participation of Grigory: I am writing to him and Zina at once, to have them send it to you immediately).
You say, moreover, that for this reason “you don’t know what it’s all about”.
But you add there and then, for some reason: “I know, I feel, that you have cooled off towards Radek and Co.
” You will agree that this is somewhat strange.
After all,my apprehension about intrigue on the part of Radek and Co.
, my conviction that this is so, springs directly from the facts concerning Vorbote (I wrote to you about it).
470 That is the first point.
And the second, and most important, is that it springs from Gazeta Robotnicza.
It is in that paper that Radek and Co.
began an intrigue against us, when we had nowhere written a single line against them! 471 After all, this is a fact.
You can’t brush facts aside.
The old “game” (the word used in the C.
O.
A.
resolution) of playing up our split with Chkheidze and Co.
began in Gazeta Robotnicza, and is Tyszka’s old, long famil-iar game.
472 So what are we to do? Either we allow this game not only to grow unhindered, but to seep through to our journal.
This is what the paragraph in the Japanese woman’s draft Rules leads to! And it would mean a hopeless and final war against Radek and Co.
You write, as though against me, that “it is not to our advantage to quarrel with the Zimmerwald Left”.
I reply: if we are not to have a final quarrel with Radek and Co.
(and through them with others as well, should things go badly), we must, for that very purpose, make this kind of “game” and intrigue impossible in our journal.
That is just why I refuse to go along with the discussing “contributors”, and refuse to join Kommunist.
It’s one of two things: if we agree to restore Kommunist, it would mean opening the door to the development of that intrigue; it would mean us opening the door to it.
This would be a mad policy, I am sure.
Does the Japanese woman understand all its implications? I don’t know, but that isn’t very important: the “mechanics” of relations abroad would itself lead to such a result, regardless of the malice or angelic goodness and purity of the Japanese woman’s intentions.
The other prospect: not to revive Kommunist.
To issue another miscellany.
Give the editors the right of discussion.
Analyse the national question.
Beat off Gazeta Robotnicza’s game and intrigue.
Radek or his friends attacked us in Gazeta Robotnicza.
We replied in our miscellany, 4 7 3 only in ours, please note, not in one published in common with the Zimmerwald Left of other countries.
That’s where it ends.
The Zimmerwald Left, whom Radek tried without success to drag into a quarrel with us at Kienthal (in talks with Platten and others, he wanted to deprive us of equality in the main commission of the Left but the Left wouldn’t let him do it)—these Zimmerwald Left have nothing to do with the struggle between Gazeta Robotnicza and Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata.
The Zimmerwald Left cannot intervene in this struggle, they cannot take offence and complain: Radek and Co.
were the first to attack in Gazeta Robotnicza, and they have had their reply in Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata (or in some other miscellany).
In such a situation, no efforts by Radek and Co.
can conceivably bring about a quarrel between our-selves and the Zimmerwald Left (just as at Kienthal Radek failed to set us at loggerheads, either with Platten or with the German Left, though he did try to).
While Radek and Co.
reply to us in the next issue of Gazeta Robotnicza, and we to them in another miscellany (I insist absolutely on agreements from miscellany to miscellany), quite a lot of time will go by.
And during all that time, if that is the approach, Radek and Co.
’s dirty trick in Gazeta Robotnicza will not be able to set us at loggerheads with the Left.
That is why I have said, and still say, that I will not on any account now either join Kommunist, or accept equal rights with the Japanese woman, or membership at all jointly with Radek in our own miscellany, because I am convinced that this will make inevitable a quarrel with the Left.
If we issue Kommunist No.
3, then Radek and Bronski and Pannekoek (and the general public) will have the right to expect, and will expect, a continuation of the same thing; they will have the right to expect, and will expect, all pos-sible guarantees for contributors; they will have the right, finally (and this is particularly important), to take offence and intervene if we reply there to Gazeta Robotnicza’s dirty tricks.
This throws the gates wide open to intrigue.
In that event, Radek and Co.
will surely bring about a quarrel between us and the Left, because even Pannekoek will have the most sacred right to say: it wasn’t that kind of Kommunist that I agreed to join, I don’t want“attacks” on Gazeta Robotnicza (he will depict defence as attack: you know how that’s done).
In that case, Radek and Co.
will have the right to issue any letter to the general public, both in Russian and in German; they will have the right to say: Kommunist was in practice (this is a fact) the common organ of yourselves& Pannekoek&Radek&Bronski, while you use it to “offend” Gazeta Robotnicza, you are beginning to split the Left, and so on and so forth (as he had already been saying at Kien-thal, note that: he had already used this strategy at Kienthal).
And in the eyes of the whole Left, the blame falls on us! We allowed ourselves to be drawn into a quarrel with the Left, we fell into the Tyszka trap.
That is where continuing the Kommunist leads to; that is why I refuse to go in.
Whereas on the contrary, I repeat, if—in a separate, new miscellany, without Pannekoek, Radek, Bronski—we reply to Gazeta Robotnicza, reply to Bukharin and anyone else, this is absolutely no concern of the Zimmerwald Left, and they cannot either interfere or take offence.
Radek cannot “com-plain” either to Pannekoek or to the Germans that Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata has replied to Gazeta Robotnicza.
And then, in addition, there is also the question of de-featism.
The same applies.
And then there is also the question of the Chkheidze group.
The same applies.
For that is what Gazeta Robotnicza was playing on.
If the Japanese woman has no “evil intentions”, she cannot reject an agreement on one miscellany (without Radek and the others), when we provide for a discussion with the Japa-nese and Bukharin.
We are agreeable likewise to have it in a separate pamphlet (if Bukharin wants it, for he will then be able in advance to look at my “tone”, about which he has expressed fears).
It will then be possible to separate the argu-ments with Bukharin from the joint work with Bukharin.
My articles and Grigory’s about defeatism, self-determina-tion, Gazeta Robotnicza’s dirty tricks, Chkheidze, “self-defence”, etc.
, your articles about the “War Industries Com-mittees”, etc.
, Varin’s and Safarov’s (we mustn’t have foreigners in this miscellany), etc.
, and whatever they please from Bukharin and the Japanese.
There is the plan for an agreement on one miscellany.
The Japanese woman cannot refuse, unless she has evil intentions.
One cannot insist on Kommunist, if it has fallen to pieces; it is absurd and ridiculous to drag me by force into Kommunist; they won’t succeed.
But if the Japanese woman won’t have an agreement on a separate miscellany, that means she has evil intentions or (which is all the same for the cause) her policy leads to an evil intrigue.
And then we publish Sbornik Sotsial-Demokrata alone.

7 Printed from the originalTO SOPHIA RAVICH Dear Comrade Olga, Inessa very badly needs a passport.
474 We beg you to take the enclosed letter to Guilbeaux (directeur de Demain, 28 rue du Marché, visitors on Fridays 2-4; perhaps it would be better to ask him for an interview by postcard).
Of course don’t tell either him, or anyone else, who the passport is for.
It is better to see Guilbeaux personally: we have thought it over from every angle, and have decided that it would be better than writing to him.
I hope this request will not give you or V.
K.
too much trouble.
Have you at your library the book by Yu.
Delevsky (I think that’s his name?): Class Contradictions within the Modern Proletariat, or something like that? 475 If it’s not at your library, perhaps you know someone who has it (and, by the way, do you happen to know the exact title of the book?).
Best greetings to you both, Yours, Lenin Nadya sends her regards.

M.
, I was long in answering your letter because, owing to Na-dya’s illness, we’d had to move into the mountains.
I quite agree with you that the role of Left-winger at the conference with Huysmans will, in the main, be one of collecting in-formation.
476 This is more important than anything else.
The most important thing is to make notes on the spot, and about everything.
Collect each and every kind of document; and do not forget for a single minute the need for full infor-mation.
The only way is to write down everything (even if briefly) at once, on the spot, in a special notebook.
Grimm is not going: they didn’t give him a passport.
That means there is to be only one Left-winger.
This makes his respon-sibility all the greater.
It will take great resolution and full political clarity to carry on the line alone: you are the best judge of whether these qualities are there.
If they are, it would be a good thing to “put” a couple of questions to the vote: approve Zimmerwald; ditto Kienthal; condemn the social-patriots, Hyndman and Co.
, Sembat and Co.
, Legien and Co.
, Plekhanov and Co.
The same thing can also be done in the form of questions.
It’ll be up to you to decide whether this can be done.
Please drop me a couple of words about the receipt of this postcard.
Alexander must have taken all the addresses with him, and will try and find out whether anything has been printed in America about the Zimmerwald Left and get it, and contact the Socialist Propaganda League, the Socialist Labour Party, International Socialist Review and Appeal toReason.
If you get this postcard and reply, we may perhaps have time to write each other about what precisely it is convenient to ask him to do there.
One personal request: have you any publishing connec-tions? I have none.
By way of earnings, I should like to have either a translation, or an article on education for Nadya (her illness requires a prolonged stay in the mountains, and that is expensive).
Best greetings and good wishes.
Nadya sends her regards.

Ich gratuliere! * Perhaps you could write a brief summary of the main points for our Sbor-nik Sotsial-Demokrata, if you were going to write on the same subject? We are in a terribly difficult situation: we failed to calculate beforehand the exact size of the articles, we have “swollen up” out of all proportion, we have not been able to “unload”, and are now faced with the prospect of a great big volume, which is least convenient for propaganda from abroad.
Drop me a few words about your subject, and about whether you could, without detriment to the subject, confine yourself to 4-5 pages of our large size (you have it in the proofs, and you will probably not find it too hard to calcu-late precisely).
Write.

SHKLOVSKY Dear G.

Please let me know directly you get this letter.
1) I have a request to you: I need to dispatch a manu-script in bindings: 100 sheets (not pages but sheets) just like this one (destination, same as Grigory’s).
477 Please order two books of suitable format: you will get the manuscript in 5-6 days.
I am in a terrible hurry with the dis-patch (I have lost my own copy!) and therefore would very much ask you to hurry, and if you can’t do it, to reply as soon as possible, so that I could look for someone else through whom to arrange it.
2) Why do you say nothing about my papers? If you can’t manage anything (or if it’s inconvenient), do not hesitate to let me know.
It isn’t worth while going to a lot of trouble over it! 3) Did you get a printed copy of the “paper” on the Ts.
case 478 from Moor? This is essential.
Don’t forget! We must get hold of it at all costs, or he may lose it, the scoundrel! 4) Why has there not been a money report for a long time? Or has there been such a windfall that you can’t add it up? Greetings to all, from Lyuda on.

BELENKY Dear Grisha, And so the misunderstanding has been cleared up.
It’s not worth talking about it any more.
It isn’t worth while publishing in Paris under the censorship.
If the possibility of publishing without censorship definitely arises, then write, in as much detail as you can.
We agree to a (provisional) editorial board for publishing leaflets in Paris: Varin&Domov&1 from the Paris group.
480 The papers say that there is to be a conference of the En-tente socialists at the Palais Bourbon on Dec.
24, 1916.
Find out whether this is so.
We shall send a leaflet from the Cen-tral Committee, and you make as thorough preparations as possible for publishing and distributing it in that event.
Many thanks for all you are sending us.
Send and write as much as you can.

The first draft made a much more straightforward statement about revolutionary agitation and revolutionary action.
We showed it to Bebel; he replied: I don’t accept it, because then the Public Prosecutor will dissolve our party organisations, and we can’t have that, as there are no serious developments as yet.
After consulta-tion with legal specialists and numerous redraftings of the text in order to give legal expression to the same idea, a final formula was found which Bebel agreed to accept.

On Jan.
7, Münzenberg proposed that the congress should be postponed to March (clearly wishing by this proposition to expose the hypocrisy of the arguments used by Grimm& the social-patriots).
It was defeated.
489 Greulich proposed postponement until May.
Nobs stated that he was in favour (once again choosing the lesser evil and exposing the same crowd).
When Nobs said that he was for, Greulich (what a character!) immediately withdrew his proposition (having seen his mistake).
Then Naine declared that he was moving Greulich’s proposal.
It was defeated.
Münzenberg proposed that the cantonal committees (to whom the matter has now been referred) should be allowed time until July.
It was defeated! These facts show up Grimm’s unprecedented impudence, when he says in his article (Berner Tagwacht of Jan.
8 or 9, Parteibeschlüsse) 4 9 0 that the Left wing, too, were “in principle” not against postponement! Münzenberg has written an article for Volksrecht (Nobs has promised to insert it tomorrow or the day after) against the decision of the Partei-Vorstand.

You are not alone, to tell the truth, in having bouts of “pessimism”.
494 The party here is opportunist through and through, a benevolent society for petty-bourgeois officials.
Even the alleged Left leaders (like Nobs and Platten) are no use at all: the said two in particular.
4 9 5 You can’t do anything without access to the masses.
But while taking care not to entertain excessive hopes, we should not fall into pessimism either: this is an important moment, and if we helped ever so little (a couple of leaflets or the’ like), that would also be something.
Even that will not be lost quite without trace.
I am very glad that you have the intention to help in every possible way in the distribution of the leaflet.
4 9 6 Please, don’t forget to destroy all our correspondence.
When is your cantonal congress of the Socialist Party? I sent a draft resolution to Abramovich.

KARPINSKY Martov’s plan is a good one 500: it’s necessary to work for it, but w e (and you) cannot do this directly.
We shall be open to suspicion.
It’s necessary that, in addition to Martov, non-Party Russians and patriotic Russians should approach Swiss Ministers (and influential people, lawyers, etc.
, something that can be done in Geneva as well) request-ing them to have a talk about it with the German Govern-ment’s Ambassador at Berne.
We cannot take part, either directly or indirectly; our participation will spoil it all.
But the plan, in itself, is a very good one and is very right.

Minutes), State Publishing House Printed from the text in the bookREPORT AT A MEETING OF BOLSHEVIK DELEGATES TO THE ALL-RUSSIA CONFERENCE OF SOVIETS OF WORKERS’ AND SOLDIERS’ DEPUTIES APRIL 4 (17), 1917 514 I have put down a few theses on which I will make some comments.
For lack of time I was unable to present a cir-cumstantial and systematic report.
The basic question is the attitude to the war.
The main thing that comes to the fore, when you read about Russia and see what goes on here, is the victory of defencism, the victory of the traitors to socialism, the deception of the masses by the bourgeoisie.
What strikes one is that here in Russia the socialist movement is in the same state as in other countries: defencism, “defence of the fatherland”.
The differ-ence is that nowhere is there such freedom as here, and therefore we have a special responsibility to the whole inter-national proletariat.
The new government is as imperialist as the previous one; it is imperialist through and through, despite its promise of a republic.
“I.
In our attitude towards the war, which under the new government of Lvov and Co.
unquestionably remains on Russia’s part a predatory imperialist war owing to the capitalist nature of that government, not the slightest con-cession to ‘revolutionary defencism’ is permissible.
“The class-conscious proletariat can give its consent to a revolutionary war, which would really justify revolutionary defencism, only on condition: a) that power passes to the proletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants aligned with the proletariat; b) that all annexations are renounced in deed and not in word; c) that a complete break is effected in actual fact with all capitalist interests.
“In view of the undoubted honesty of those broad sections of the mass believers in revolutionary defencism who accept the war only as a necessity, and not as a means of conquest, in view of the fact that they are being deceived by the bourgeoisie, it is necessary with particular thoroughness, persistence and patience to explain their error to them, to explain the inseparable connection existing between capi-tal and the imperialist war, and to prove that without over-throwing capital it is impossible to end the war by a truly democratic peace, a peace not imposed by violence.
“The most widespread campaign for this view must be organised in the army at the front.
“Fraternisation.
” We cannot allow the slightest concession to defencism in our attitude to the war even under the new government, which remains imperialist.
The masses take a practical and not a theoretical view of things.
They say: “I want to defend the fatherland, not to seize other peoples’ lands.
” When can a war be considered your own? When annexations are completely renounced.
The masses take a practical and not a theoretical ap-proach to the question.
We make the mistake of taking the theoretical approach.
A class-conscious proletarian can agree to a revolutionary war, which really does justify revolutionary defencism.
The practical approach is the only possible one with representatives of the mass of the soldiers.
We are not pacifists in any sense.
But the main question is: which class is carrying on the war? The class of capitalists, linked with the banks, cannot wage any kind of war except an imperial-ist one.
The working class can.
Steklov and Chkheidze have forgotten everything.
When you read the resolution of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies, you are amazed that people calling themselves socialists could adopt such a resolution.
515 What is specific in Russia is the extremely rapid transi-tion from savage violence to the most subtle deception.
The main condition is renunciation of annexations not in words, but in deeds.
Rech howls at Sotsial-Demokrat’s statement that the integration of Courland with Russia is annexation.
But annexation is the integration of any country with dis-tinct national peculiarities; it is any integration of a nation against its will, irrespective of whether it differs in language,if it feels itself to be another people.
This is a prejudice of the Great Russians which has been fostered for centuries.
The war can be ended only by a clean break with interna-tional capital.
The war was engendered not by individuals but by international finance capital.
It is no easy thing to break with international capital, but neither is it an easy thing to end the war.
It is childishness and naïveté to ex-pect one side alone to end the war.
.

Zimmerwald, Kien-thal 516 .

.
We have a greater obligation than anyone else to safeguard the honour of international socialism.
The dif-ficulty of approach.
.
.
.
In view of the undoubted existence of a defencist mood among the masses, who recognise the war only of necessity and not for the sake of conquest, we must explain to them most circumstantially, persistently and patiently that the war cannot be ended in a non-rapacious peace unless capital is overthrown.
This idea must be spread far and wide.
The soldiers want a concrete answer: how to end the war.
But it is political fraud to promise the people that we can end the war only by the goodwill of individual persons.
The masses must be forewarned.
A revolution is a difficult thing.
It is impossible to avoid mistakes.
Our mistake is that we (have not exposed?) revolutionary defencism to the full.
Revolutionary defencism is betrayal of socialism.
We cannot confine ourselves.
.
.
.
We must admit our mis-take.
What is to be done? To explain.
How to present .
.
.
who doesn’t know what socialism is.
.
.
.
We are not charlatans.
We must base ourselves only on the political consciousness of the masses.
Even if we have to remain in a minority let it be so.
It is worth while giving up our leading position for a time; we should not be afraid of remaining in a minority.
When the masses say they don’t want conquest, I believe them.
When Guchkov and Lvov say they don’t want conquest, they are swindlers.
When the worker says that he wants to defend the country, he voices the oppressed man’s instinct.
“II.
The specific feature of the present situation in Rus-sia is that the country is passing from the first stage of the revolution—which, owing to the insufficient class-conscious-ness and organisation of the proletariat, placed power in the hands of the bourgeoisie—to the second stage, whichmust place power in the hands of the proletariat and the poorest sections of the peasants.
“This transition is characterised, on the one hand, by a maximum of legally recognised rights (Russia is now the freest of all the belligerent countries in the world); on the other, by the absence of violence towards the masses, and, finally, by their unreasoning trust in the government of capitalists, those worst enemies of peace and socialism.
“ This peculiar situation demands of us an ability to adapt ourselves to the special conditions of Party work among unprecedentedly large masses of proletarians who have just awakened to political life.
” Why didn’t they take power? Steklov says: for this reason and that.
This is nonsense.
The fact is that the pro-letariat is not organised and class-conscious enough.
This must be admitted; material strength is in the hands of the proletariat, but the bourgeoisie turned out to be prepared and class-conscious.
This is a monstrous fact, but it should be frankly and openly admitted, and the people should be told that they didn’t take power because they were unor-ganised and not conscious enough.
.
.
.
The ruin of millions, the death of millions.
The most advanced countries are on the brink of disaster, and they will therefore be faced with the question.
.
.
.
The transition from the first stags to the second—the transfer of power to the proletariat and the peasantry—is characterised, on the one hand, by the maximum of legality (Russia today is the freest and most progressive country in the world) and, on the other, by an attitude of blind trust on the part of the masses in the government.
Even our Bolsheviks show some trust in the government.
This can be explained only by the intoxication of the revolution.
It is the death of socialism.
You comrades have a trusting attitude to the government.
If that is so, our paths diverge.
I prefer to remain in a minority.
One Lieb-knecht is worth more than 110 defencists of the Steklov and Chkheidze type.
If you sympathise with Liebknecht and stretch out even a finger (to the defencists), it will be be-trayal of international socialism.
If we break away from those people .
.
.
everyone who is oppressed will come to us, be-cause the war will lead him to us; he has no other way out.
The people should be spoken to without Latin words, in clear and simple terms.
They have the right .
.
.
—we must adapt ourselves .
.
.
make the change, but it is essen-tial.
Our line will prove to be the correct one.
“III.
No support for the Provisional Government; the utter falsity of all its promises should be made clear, particularly of those relating to the renunciation of annexations.
Exposure in place of the impermissible, illusion-breeding ‘demand’ that this government, a government of capitalists, should cease to be an imperialist govern-ment.
” Pravda demands of the government that it should renounce annexations.
To demand of a government of capitalists that it should renounce annexations is nonsense, a crying mockery of.
.
.
.
From the scientific standpoint this is such gross decep-tion which all the international proletariat, all.
.
.
.
It is time to admit our mistake.
We’ve had enough of greetings and resolutions, it is time to act.
We must get down to a sober, business-like.
.
.
.
“IV.
Recognition of the fact that in most of the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies our Party is in a minority, so far a small minority, as against a bloc of all the petty-bourgeois opportunist elements, from the Popular Socialists 517 and the Socialist-Revolutionaries down to the Organising Com-mittee (Chkheidze, Tsereteli, etc.
), Steklov, etc.
, etc.
, who have yielded to the influence of the bourgeoisie and spread that influence among the proletariat.
“The masses must be made to see that the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies are the only possible form of revolution-ary government, and that therefore our task is, as long as this government yields to the influence of the bourgeoi-sie, to present a patient, systematic, and persistent expla-nation of the errors of their tactics, an explanation espe-cially adapted to the practical needs of the masses.
“As long as we are in the minority we carry on the work of criticising and exposing errors and at the same time we preach the necessity of transferring the entire state power to the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, so that the people may overcome their mistakes by experience.
” We Bolsheviks are in the habit of taking the line of maxi-mum revolutionism.
But that is not enough.
We must sort things out.
The Soviet of Workers’ Deputies is the real government.
To think otherwise is to fall into anarchism.
It is a recog-nised fact that in the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies our Party is in a minority.
We must explain to the masses that the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies is the only possible government, a government without parallel in the world, except for the Commune.
What if a majority of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies takes the defencist stand? That cannot be helped.
It remains for us to explain, patiently, persistently, systematically, the erroneous nature of their tactics.
So long as we are in a minority, we carry on the work of criticism, in order to open the people’s eyes to the decep-tion.
We don’t want the masses to take our word for it.
We are not charlatans.
We want the masses to overcome their mistakes through experience.
The manifesto of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies con-tains not a word imbued with class-consciousness.
It’s all talk! Talk, flattery of the revolutionary people, is the only thing that has ruined all revolutions.
The whole of Marxism teaches us not to succumb to revolutionary phrases, particularly at a time when they have the greatest currency.
“V.
Not a parliamentary republic—to return to a parlia-mentary republic from the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies would be a retrograde step—but a republic of Soviets of Workers’, Agricultural Labourers’ and Peasants’ Deputies throughout the country, from top to bottom.
“Abolition of the police, the army and the bureaucracy.
* “The salaries of all officials, all of whom are elective and displaceable at any time, not to exceed the average wage of a competent worker.
” This is the lesson of the French Commune, which Kautsky forgot and which the workers teach us in 1905 and 1917.
The experience of these years teaches us that we must not allow the police and the old army to be restored.
* i.
e.
, the standing army to be replaced by the arming of the whole people.
The programme should be changed, it is out of date.
The Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies is a step to socialism.
There must be no police, no army, no official-dom.
The convocation of the Constituent Assembly—but by whom? Resolutions are written only to be shelved or sat on.
I should be glad to have the Constituent Assembly convened tomorrow, but it is naïve to believe that Guch-kov will call it.
All the chatter about forcing the Provi-sional Government to call the Constituent Assembly is empty talk, a pack of lies.
Revolutions were made, but the police stayed on, revolutions were made, but all the officials, etc.
, stayed on.
That was why the revolutions foundered.
The Soviet of Workers’ Deputies is the only government which can call that assembly.
We all seized upon the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies, but have failed to under-stand them.
From this form we are dragging back to the International, which is trailing behind the bourgeoisie.
A bourgeois republic cannot solve the problem (of the war), because it can be solved only on an international scale.
We don’t promise liberation .
.
.
but we say that it is possible only in this form (Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies).
No government except the Soviet of Workers’ and Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.
If you talk about the Commune, they won’t understand.
But if you say, there is the Soviet of Workers’ and Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies instead of the police, learn to govern— no one can interfere with us—(that they will understand).
No books will ever teach you the art of government.
Learning to govern is a matter of trial and error.
“VI.
The weight of emphasis in the agrarian programme to be shifted to the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.
“Confiscation of all landed estates.
“Nationalisation of all lands in the country, the land to be disposed of by the local Soviets of Agricultural La-bourers’ and Peasants’ Deputies.
The organisation of separate Soviets of Deputies of Poor Peasants.
The setting up of a model farm on each of the large estates (ranging in size from 100 to 300 dessiatines, according to local and other conditions and to the decisions of the local bodies) under the control of the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Depu-ties and for the public account.
”What is the peasantry? We don’t know, there are no statistics, but we do know that it is a force.
If they take the land, you can be sure that they won’t give it back to you, they won’t ask us.
The pivot, the centre of gravity of the programme has shifted, and is the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.
If the Russian peasant doesn’t settle the revolution, the German worker will.
The Tambov muzhik.
.
.
.
The first dessiatine cost free, the second, for 1 ruble, the third, for 2 rubles.
We shall take over the land, and the landowner will never be able to take it back.
Communal farming.
It is necessary to organise separate Soviets of Deputies from the poor peasants.
There is the rich muzhik, and there is the labourer.
Even if you give him land, he won’t set up a farm.
The large estates should be turned into model farms run on social lines, with management by the Soviets of Agricultural Labourers’ Deputies.
There are large estates.
“VII.
The immediate amalgamation of all banks in the country into a single national bank, and the institution of control over it by the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies.
” The bank is “a form of social book-keeping” (Marx).
War teaches economy; everyone knows that the banks sap the strength of the people.
The banks are the nerve, the focus of the national economy.
We cannot take hold of the banks, but we advocate their amal-gamation under the control of the Soviet of Workers’ Deputies.
“VIII.
It is not our immediate task to ‘introduce’ so-cialism, but only to bring social production and the distri-bution of products at once under the control of the Soviets of Workers’ Deputies.
” Practice and the revolution tend to push the Constituent Assembly into the background.
The important thing about laws is not that they are put down on paper, but who car-ries them out.
The dictatorship of the proletariat is there, but people don’t know haw to work it.
Capitalism has developed into state capitalism.
.
.
.
Marx .
.
.
only that which has matured in practice.
.
.
.
“IX.
Party tasks: (a) Immediate convocation of a Party congress.
(b) Amendment of the Party Programme, mainly: 1) On the question of imperialism and the imperialist war; 2) On our attitude towards the state and our demand for a “commune state” *; 3) Amendment of our out-of-date minimum programme.
(c) Change of the Party’s name.
** “X.
A new International.
“We must take the initiative in creating a revolutionary International, an International against the social-chauvin-ists and against the ‘Centre’.
***” General conclusion.
The Soviet of Workers’ Deputies has been created, it enjoys vast influence.
All instinctively sympathise with it.
This institution combines far more revolutionary thought than all the revolutionary phrases.
If the Soviet of Work-ers’ Deputies succeeds in taking government into its own hands, the cause of liberty is assured.
You may write the most ideal laws, but who will put them into effect? The same officials, but they are tied up with the bourgeoisie.
It is not “introduce socialism” that we ought to tell the masses, but put it into effect (?).
Capitalism has gone ahead, war capitalism is different from that which existed before the war.
On the basis of our tactical conclusions we must go on to practical steps.
A Party congress must be called at once and the Programme revised.
A great deal in it is out of date.
The minimum programme must be changed.
* That is, a state of which the Paris Commune was the prototype.
** We must call ourselves the Communist Party, instead of “Social-Democratic”, for the official Social-Democrat leaders throughout the world have betrayed socialism and have gone over to the bourgeoise (the “defencists” and wavering “Kautskians”).
*** “Centre” is the name given among international Social-Democrats to the trend which wavers between the chauvinists (= the “defencists”) and the internationalists, namely, Kautsky and Co.
in Germany; Longuet and Co.
in France; Chkheidze and Co.
in Russia; Turati and Co.
in Italy; MacDonald and Co.
in Britain, etc.
I personally propose that we change the name of our Party and call it the Communist Party.
The people will understand the name of “Communist”.
Most of the official Social-Democrats have committed treason, they have betrayed socialism.
.
.
.
Liebknecht is the one Social-Demo-crat.
.
.
.
You are afraid of betraying old recollections.
But if you want to change your underwear you must take off your dirty shirt and put on a clean one.
Why throw out the experience of world-wide struggle? Most of the Social-Democrats throughout the world have betrayed socialism, and have sided with their governments (Scheidemann, Ple-khanov, Guesde).
What is to be done to make Scheidemann agree?.
.
.
This point of view spells ruin for socialism.
It would be deception to send a radio telegram to Scheidemann about ending the war.
.
.
.
The term “Social-Democracy” is inexact.
Don’t cling to an old word which has become rotten through and through.
If you want to build a new party .
.
.
and all the oppressed will come to you.

We declare that we have formed a Left wing and have broken with the Centre.

.

, or you.
.
.
.
The Left Zimmerwald trend exists in all the countries of the world.
The masses must realise that socialism has split throughout the world.
The defencists have renounced socialism.
Liebknecht alone.
.
.
.
The future is with him.
I have heard that there is a tendency in Russia towards unification, towards unity with the defencists.
This is be-trayal of socialism.
I think it is better to remain alone, like Liebknecht: one against 110.

We shall see whether he suc-ceeds.
If you get the newspapers, they will give you an idea of the whole situation.
In case the papers don’t reach you, let me describe it in brief.
The bourgeoisie (&Plekhanov) are furiously attacking us for travelling through Germany.
They are trying to in-cite the soldiers against us.
So far it isn’t coming off: there are supporters, and loyal ones, among them.
Among the S.
R.
s and the Social-Democrats there is the most desperate chauvinist excitement, which has taken the form of “revolutionary defencism” (now, they allege, there is some-thing to defend, namely, the republic against Wilhelm).
We are being furiously attacked for opposing “unity”, while the masses are for the unity of all Social-Democrats.
We are against.
Chkheidze has sunk completely into “revolutionary de-fencism”.
In a bloc with Potresov.
All are for the Liberty Loan.
520 It is opposed only by us&the Nashe Slovo group& Larin and a handful of Martov’s friends.
We are calling an all-Russia conference of Bolsheviks on April 22, 1917.
521 We hope completely to straighten out the line of Pravda, which has wobbled towards “Kautskyism”.
522 Write articles for Pravda on foreign affairs—very short and in the Pravda spirit (it’s so small! There is so little space! We are working to enlarge it).
Also, most briefly, about the German revolutionary movement and the Leftist press.
Write us a letter about the doings among the Swedish Left.
523 We have heard that the chauvinist Branting is attacking Radek.
At the beginning of the revolution, the Soviet of Work-ers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies concluded an agreement with the Provisional Government for support of the latter.
524 There is a “Contact Commission”: the Soviet “supervises” the Provisional Government.
The position is extremely complex and exceptionally interesting.
We are publishing pamphlets on tactics.
525 The Soviet wants a general, international socialist congress.
We want only a congress of the Left, against the social-chauvinists and against the “Centre”.
I shake your hands, and wish you all the best.
Write as often as you can and be very regular and careful in your contacts.
Yours, V.

KAMENEV Comrade Kamenev Entre nous: if they do me in, I ask you to publish my notebook: “Marxism on the State” (it got left behind in Stock-holm).
535 It’s bound in a blue cover.
It contains a collection of all the quotations from Marx and Engels, likewise from Kautsky against Pannekoek.
There are a number of remarks and notes, and formulations.

N.
I.
Bukharin suggests that he be released from work in the Economic Conference, to enable him to devote himself entirely to work in Pravda.
Comrade Lenin points out that up to now the Economic Conference has not received sufficient attention, yet it is one of the most important factors in current state construc-tion, 5 3 8 and therefore needs expert men, like Comrade Bukharin.
Therefore he insists that Comrade Bukharin should not be on Pravda’s editorial board.
2 Yelena Stasova proposes an editorial board for Pravda composed of the following three: J.
V.
Stalin, G.
Y.
Sokolnikov and N.

Bukharin.
Comrade Lenin proposes a different three: Sokolnikov, Stalin and Trotsky.

C.
has made concessions.
He makes the concrete proposal that the four should be required to state in writing where they want their letter to go, i.
e.
, whether they want it printed in the press.
For our part we do not intend to send it to the press, but reply to them in writing that we are not taking them back.

, and sim-ilarly the draft of the Supreme Economic Council for “dis-trict economic councils ” 551 suggest the need to amalgamate such bodies.
| | | | || | | | | | | | || | | | Preliminary theses: | (Etwa * ): | supply and marketing committees? || The basic unit should be consumer and producer (better than purchasing and trading, etc.
) volost societies, playing the part both of supply committees and marketing agencies.
In case of need, volost boundaries could be made alterable.
In the towns a similar place could perhaps be taken by block committees or committees for sections of blocks.
If we manage to set up such committees, basic units, in the localities, the amalgamation of these committees would provide a network capable of properly organising the supply of the whole population with all essentials, and of organising production on a national scale.
Possibly instead of “societies” these could be Soviets of Workers’ and Peasants’ Deputies, with the participation of commercial employees, etc.
, etc.
Every such society or committee or Soviet (or supply and marketing committee) would be divided up into sec-tions or departments, according to goods marketed and types of products supplied, for the general regulation of production and consumption (a department for finance, or for cash * Roughly.
—Ed.
receipts and disbursements, should be attached to every supply and marketing committee).
With the right of levy-ing income tax and granting interest-free credits to the poor, and also universal labour service, this might be the basic unit of socialist society.
The volost banks would then have to be amalgamated with the state savings banks, being transformed into a state-wide accounting department, aggregate of the state’s receipts and disbursements accounts.
The transportation of products, and likewise their pur-chase and sale, would then be permitted only from one supply and marketing committee to another, all individual marketing being prohibited.
On certificates issued by volost (or generally the “basic”, lowest) supply and market-ing committees, products could be sold also to individuals from central stores, provided that these transactions are recorded in the books of the volost or other supply and marketing committees (except within small units, or for trifles).
No transportation of products would be permitted without certificates from the supply and marketing com-mittee.
This would be the unification of the Commissariats for Agriculture, Trade and Industry, Labour, and Food, and the Supreme Economic Council, and the Commissa-riats for Finance and Communications.

(B.
) JANUARY 11 (24), 1918 MINUTES 1 Comrade Lenin speaks first and points out that at the meeting on January 8 (21) three standpoints were brought out on this question, and asks whether the question should be discussed point by point on the theses he put forward, or whether a general discussion should be opened.
The second alternative is adopted, and Comrade Lenin has the floor.
He begins by setting forth the three standpoints brought out at the previous meeting (1) signing a separate annexa-tionist peace, (2) waging a revolutionary war, and (3) pro-claiming the war ended, demobilising the army, but not signing a peace treaty.
At the previous meeting, the first standpoint received 15 votes, the second 32 and the third 16.
Comrade Lenin points out that the Bolsheviks have never renounced defence, but this defence and protection of the fatherland must have a definite, concrete context, which exists at the present time, namely, defence of the Socialist Republic against an extremely strong international imperialism.
The question is only one of how we should defend our fatherland, the Socialist Republic.
The army is excessively fatigued by the war; the horses are in such a state that in the event of an offensive we shall not be able to move the artillery; the Germans are holding such favourable positions on the islands in the Baltic that if they start an offensive they could take Reval and Petrogradwith their bare hands.
By continuing the war in such con-ditions, we shall greatly strengthen German imperialism, peace will have to be concluded just the same, but then the peace will be still worse because it is not we who will be concluding it.
The peace we are now forced to conclude is undoubtedly an ignominious one, but if war begins, our government will be swept away and peace will be concluded by a different government.
At present, we are relying not only on the proletariat but also on the poor peasantry, which will abandon us if the war continues.
Drawing out the war is in the interest of French, British and American imperial-ism, and proof of this, for example, is the offer made at Krylenko’s headquarters by the Americans to pay 100 rubles for every Russian soldier.
Those who take the standpoint of revolutionary war stress that we shall then be engaged in a civil war with German imperialism, and shall thereby awaken revolution in Germany.
But Germany, after all, is still only pregnant with revolution, whereas we have already given birth to a quite healthy infant, the Socialist Republic, which we may kill if we start the war.
We are in possession of a circular letter of the German Social-Democrats, there is information about the attitude to us of two trends in the Centre, of which one considers that we have been bought, and that the current events in Brest are a farce, with the actors playing out their parts.
This section is attack-ing us for the armistice.
The other section of the Kautsky-ites says that the personal honesty of the leaders of the Bol-sheviks is beyond all doubt, but that the Bolsheviks’ behaviour is a psychological riddle.
553 We don’t know the opinion of the Left-wing Social-Democrats.
The British workers are supporting our efforts for peace.
Of course, the peace we conclude will be an ignominious one, but we need a breathing space in order to carry out social reforms (take transport alone); we need to consolidate our-selves, and this takes time.
We need to complete the crush-ing of the bourgeoisie, but for this we need to have both our hands free.
Once we have done this, we shall free both our hands, and then we should be able to carry on a revolu-tionary war against international imperialism.
The echelons of the revolutionary volunteer army which have now been formed are the officers of our future army.
What Comrade Trotsky is proposing—an end to the war, refusal to sign a peace treaty and demobilisation of the army—is an international political demonstration.
The only thing we achieve by withdrawing our troops is handing over the Estonian Socialist Republic to the Germans.
It is said that by concluding peace we are giving a free hand to the Japanese and Americans, who will immediately occupy Vladivostok.
By the time they have even reached Irkutsk, we shall have been able to strengthen our Socialist Republic.
By signing a peace treaty we of course betray self-determined Poland, but we retain the Estonian Social-ist Republic and win a chance to consolidate our gains.
Of course, we make a turn to the right, which leads through a very dirty stable, but we must do it.
If the Germans start an offensive, we shall be forced to sign any peace treaty, and then, of course, it will be worse.
An indemnity of three thousand million is not too high a price for saving the So-cialist Republic.
By signing peace now, we give the broad masses a visual demonstration that the imperialists (of Germany, Britain and France), having taken Riga and Baghdad, are continuing to fight, whereas we are develop-ing, the Socialist Republic is developing.
2 Comrade Lenin points out that he is not in agreement on some points with his supporters Stalin and Zinoviev.
554 Of course, there is a mass movement in the West, but the revolution there has not yet begun.
But if we were to alter our tactics because of that, we should be traitors to inter-national socialism.
He does not agree with Zinoviev that the conclusion of peace will for a time weaken the move-ment in the West.
If we believe that the German movement can develop immediately, in the event of an interruption of the peace negotiations, then we must sacrifice ourselves, for the German revolution will have a force much greater than ours.
But the whole point is that the movement there has not yet begun, but over here it already has a newborn and loudly shouting infant, and unless we now say clearly that we agree to peace, we shall perish.
It is important forus to hold out until the general socialist revolution gets under way, but this we can only achieve by concluding peace.
3 Comrade Lenin motions a vote on the proposition that we drag out the signing of a peace treaty in every possible way.

3 Comrade Lenin considers it essential that in admitting members a mandatory inscription be made concerning the date of joining the Party: before Oct.

2 There is one point for achieving united tactics.
If the offensive becomes a fact, then we sign peace.
It is possible that the Germans have done a deal with the French, and this is a question not of Poland but of overthrowing the Soviet Government.
Indefinite tactics now are out of place.
We have to act.
If the Germans carry on a war by agreement with the French, then we carry on a revolutionary war.
We have to demon-strate this clearly to the people.
That is why we need either an armistice or a peace.
We may muddle people’s understand-ing.
We shall be unable to hold the masses.
There is no reply to the radio message.
Everyone will have to fight.
It will be a different grouping.
To drag on means to obscure the understanding of the masses.
They are losing their land.
We shall have concluded peace with the people, not with imperialism.

) FEBRUARY 23, 1918 562 MINUTES 1 Comrade Lenin believes that the policy of revolutionary phrases is at an end.
If this policy is continued, he will resign both from the government and from the Central Committee.
An army is needed for a revolutionary war, and it does not exist.
That means the terms must be accepted.
2 Comrade Lenin.
Some have reproached me for coming out with an ultimatum.
I put it as a last resort.
It is a mockery for our Central Committee members to talk of an international civil war.
There is a civil war in Russia, but not in Germany.
Our agitation remains.
We are agitating not by words, but by the revolution.
That too remains.
Stalin is wrong when he says that we need not sign.
These terms must be signed.
If you don’t sign them, you will sign the Soviet power’s death warrant within three weeks.
These terms do not infringe on the Soviet power.
I have not the slightest hesitation.
I put the ultimatum not in order to withdraw it.
I don’t want revolutionary phrases.
The German revolution has not yet matured.
This will take months.
The terms must be accept-ed.
If there is another ultimatum later, it will be in a new situation.
3 Comrade Lenin.
I also consider it essential to prepare for a revolutionary war.
The treaty can be interpreted, and we shall interpret it.
The demobilisation there is in a purely military sense.
Before the war, we also had an army.
A revolutionary war needs serious preparation.
I do not doubt for a second that the masses stand for peace.
4 Lenin proposes the following for voting: (1) Are the German proposals to be accepted immediately? (2) Is a revolutionary war to be prepared for immediately? (3) Is a poll of Soviet electors in Petrograd and Moscow to be taken immediately? 5 Comrade Lomov asks whether Vladimir Ilyich allows of silent or open agitation against signing the peace.
Comrade Lenin replies in the affirmative.
6 In view of the statement by several members of the C.
C.
that they are resigning all their responsible Soviet and Party posts, Y.
M.
Sverd-lov proposes that members of the C.
C.
remain at their posts until the Congress, and carry on their agitation within the Party.
Comrade Lenin is in favour of discussing the question raised by Sverdlov as, first, there are three days to go be-fore the signing and, second, twelve days for ratification.
Consequently, it will be possible to canvass the Party and, if it comes out against signing, ratification will not follow; but as time is short today, he suggests postponing the question until tomorrow.
7 Comrade Stalin asks whether resignation from their posts does not in effect mean withdrawal from the Party.
Comrade Lenin points out that resignation from the C.
C.
does not mean withdrawal from the Party.
8 Comrade Lenin suggests that the comrades should leave the sessions during the voting and should not sign any documents, so as not to bear any responsibility, but should not give up their work in the Council.

SERRATI December 4, 1918 Dear Comrade Serrati, My best wishes to you and to Comrade Lazzari.
We all hope that a proletarian revolution will soon begin in Italy, and other Entente countries.
Most cordial greetings.
Regards to Italian comrades.
Yours ever, Lenin First published in 1 9 2 0 in Almanacco socialista italiano, Milan Printed from the miscellany text, Translated from the ItalianIN MEMORY OF COMRADE PROSHYAN I became acquainted with Comrade Proshyan and learned to value his co-operation during our work together in the Council of People’s Commissars, at the end of last year and the beginning of the present year, when the Left S.
R.
s.
were in alliance with us.
Proshyan stood out for his deep devotion to the revolution and to socialism.
It could not be said of all the Left S.
R.
s that they were so-cialists, and this could even hardly be said of most of them.
But this had to be said about Proshyan, because, in spite of his loyalty to the ideology of the Russian Narodniks, a non-socialist ideology, you saw in Proshyan a deeply convinced socialist.
In his own way, not through Marxism, not starting with the idea of the class struggle of the pro-letariat, did this man become a socialist; and I was able to observe more than once, when working together with him in the Council of People’s Commissars, how Comrade Proshyan would resolutely side with the Bolsheviks, the Communists, against his fellow Left Socialist-Revolution-aries, when they expressed the standpoint of the petty pro-prietors and took a negative attitude to communist measures in the sphere of agriculture.
I particularly recall a conversation with Comrade Pro-shyan not long before the Brest peace.
It seemed then that there no longer remained any substantial differences be-tween us.
Proshyan began speaking to me about the need for our parties to amalgamate, saying that the Left S.
R.
s most remote from communism (at that time, the word was not yet commonly used) had noticeably, and very strong-ly, drawn closer to it during the period of our work to-gether in the Council of People’s Commissars.
I was reservedas regards Proshyan’s proposal, and called it premature, but did not at all deny that we had come closer in our prac-tical work.
The Brest peace brought about a complete divergence, and from divergence, given Proshyan’s revolutionary con-sistency and convictions, there could not but develop direct, even armed struggle.
I must admit I did not in any way expect matters to go as far as an insurrection, or such facts as the betrayal of Commander-in-Chief Muravyov, a Left S.
R.
But the example of Proshyan revealed how deep the roots of patriotism were even in the most sincere and con-vinced socialists from among the Left S.
R.
s, how differences in the general principles underlying men’s world views had inevitably shown themselves at a difficult turning-point in history.
The subjectivism of the Narodniks led to a fatal error on the part of even the best of them, who let themselves be blinded by the spectre of monstrous strength, that of German imperialism.
Any other struggle against that imperialism except an insurrectionary one, and moreover immediately, that very minute, without any consideration of the objective conditions of the internation-al situation and our own, seemed in the light of a revolu-tionary’s duty absolutely intolerable.
It was the effect of the very same mistake which in 1907 made the Socialist-Revolutionaries unconditionally “boycott” the Stolypin Duma.
But in the circumstances of hot revolutionary bat-tles the error took a more cruel revenge, and pushed Pro-shyan on to the path of armed struggle against the Soviet power.
Nevertheless up to July 1918 Proshyan succeeded in doing more to strengthen the Soviet power than he did after July 1918 to undermine it.
And in the international situation created after the German revolution, a new ap-proach by Proshyan to communism—a firmer one than before—would have been inevitable but for his untimely death.

5 Printed from the originalREPLY TO A PEASANT’S QUESTION 575 Izvestia of February 2 carried a letter from a peasant, G.
Gulov, who asks a question about the attitude of our Workers’ and Peasants’ Government to the middle peas-antry, and tells of rumours that Lenin and Trotsky are not getting on together, and that there are big differences between them on this very question of the middle peasant.
Comrade Trotsky has already replied to that in his “Let-ter to the Middle Peasants”, which appeared in Izvestia of February 7.
In this letter Comrade Trotsky says that the rumours of differences between him and myself are the most monstrous and shameless lie, spread by the landown-ers and capitalists, or by their witting and unwitting accomplices.
For my part, I entirely confirm Comrade Trotsky’s statement.
There are no differences between us, and as regards the middle peasants there are no differences either between Trotsky and myself, or in general in the Communist Party, of which we are both members.
In his letter Comrade Trotsky has explained clearly and in detail why the Communist Party and present Work-ers’ and Peasants’ Government, elected by the Soviets and belonging to that Party, do not consider the middle peas-ants to be their enemies.
I fully subscribe to what Comrade Trotsky has said.
576 There is not a single decree (law) or decision of the So-viet government which fails to draw a distinction between the three main groups of peasants.
The first group is the poor peasants (proletarians and semi-proletarians, as they are usually called in economic science).
They are very numerous.
When the landowners and capitalists were in power, the brunt of their yoke fell on the poor peasants.
In all the countries of the world, the workers and the rural poor supporting them are the firmest basis for the truesocialist movement.
The second group is the kulaks, that is, the rich peasants who exploit the labour of others, either hiring them for work, or lending money at interest, and so forth.
This group supports the landowners and capital-ists, the enemies of the Soviet power.
The third group is the middle peasants.
They are not enemies of the Soviet power.
They can be its friends; we are working for this, and will bring it about.
All the teachers of socialism have always recognised that the workers will have to overthrow the landowners and the capitalists in order to build social-ism, but that with the middle peasants an agreement is possible and essential.
Under the landowners and capitalists, only very few of the middle peasants, perhaps one in a hundred, managed to secure a stable welfare, and then only by becoming kulaks, and saddling the poor peasants, whereas the vast majority of the middle peasants inevitably must suffer from poverty and ill-treatment by the rich.
That is the case in all cap-italist countries.
Under socialism, all workers and all middle peasants to a man can have full and stable welfare, without robbing someone else’s labour.
No Bolshevik, no Communist, no intelligent socialist has ever entertained the idea of vio-lence against the middle peasants.
All socialists have al-ways spoken of agreement with them and of their gradual and voluntary transition to socialism.
Our country has been ruined more than other countries by the criminal four-year war of the capitalists.
Everywhere there is ruin and dislocation, lack of goods for sale, and a terrible and tormenting famine in the towns and non-agricultural gubernias.
We have to strain every effort to overcome the breakdown, to overcome the famine, to over-come the troops of the landowners and capitalists, who are trying to restore to power the tsar and the rich, the exploit-ers.
In the South, on the Don and in the Ukraine, the white-guards have been beaten, and the road to fuel (coal) and grain is being opened up.
A few final efforts, and we shall be saved from the famine.
But the destruction left behind by the war is great, and only long and self-sacrificing work by all toiling people can bring our country out on to the road to sustained prosperity.
Two kinds of complaints must be noted among those being voiced by middle peasants.
First, there are complaints at the excessively “bossy”, undemocratic, and sometimes absolutely disgraceful behaviour of the local authorities, especially in the backwoods.
Surely it is more difficult to organise proper control and supervision of the local authorities’ work in the countryside, and the worst elements and dishonest people-sometimes worm their way into the ranks of the Communists.
Those who, contrary to the laws of the Soviet power, treat the peasants unjustly must be ruth-lessly fought, immediately removed and most severely prosecuted.
All the efforts of honest workers and peasants are being directed to purging Russia of these “relics” of the landowners’ and capitalists’ system who allow them-selves to behave like “bosses” when, under the laws of our Workers’ and Peasants’ Republic, they should behave like men elected by the Soviets and set an example of con-scientiousness and strict observance of the laws.
The Soviet power has already shot quite a few such officials caught, for example, taking bribes, and the struggle against such scoundrels will be carried on to the end.
Another kind of complaint is made against the requi-sitioning of grain and the strict prohibition of free sale of grain.
Our government is fighting inexorably against ar-bitrary action and breaches of the law.
But can we allow free sale of grain? In our ruined country, there is not enough, or barely enough, grain, and in addition the railways have been so spoiled by the war that supplies are going very badly.
When there is not enough grain, the free sale of it means terrific profiteering and inflation of prices up to hundreds of rubles per pood, because a hungry man will give any-thing for a piece of bread.
The free sale of grain in a hungry country means frenzied profiteering by the kulaks, the shameless rich peasants who fill their money-bags out of the people’s need and the hunger.
The free sale of grain in a hungry country means a victory of the rich over the poor, because the rich will buy grain even at a mad, fantastic price, while the poor will have nothing.
The free sale of grain is freedom for the rich to make profits, and freedom for the poor to die.
The free sale of grain means a returnto the domination and unbridled power of the capital-ists.
No.
We don’t want to go back, and will not go back, to the restoration of the rule of the capitalists, the rule of money, and freedom to profiteer.
We want to go forward to socialism, to the proper distribution of grain among all the working people.
All grain surpluses must be handed over to the Soviet state at a fair price; and the state must distribute them equally among the working people.
This cannot be achieved all at once, it is not easy to establish such a fair socialist system.
It will take a great deal of work and effort, and strict comradely discipline among the workers and peasants, to root out the old, capitalist, freedom to trade, freedom to make profits, freedom to fight, freedom to oppress—a freedom that has covered the whole world with blood.
But this difficult work has now been taken up by mil-lions and millions of workers and peasants.
Every honest peasant and worker has realised the importance of social-ism, and is persistently fighting for it.
The socialist revolution is growing throughout the world.
The power of the capitalists, “freedom to trade”, will not return.
Socialism will win.

Written on March 8 , 1 9 1 9 First published in 1 9 2 8 in Lenin Miscellany VIII Printed from the originalDRAFT THIRD CLAUSE OF THE GENERAL POLITICAL SECTION OF THE PROGRAMME (FOR THE PROGRAMME COMMISSION OF THE EIGHTH PARTY CONGRESS) Bourgeois democracy confined itself to proclaiming for-mal rights equally applicable to all citizens, e.
g.
, the right of assembly, of association, of the press.
At best all legis-lative restrictions on these points were abolished in the most democratic bourgeois republics.
But, in reality, both administrative practices and particularly the economic bondage of the working people always made it impossible for them, under bourgeois democracy, to make any wide use of these rights and liberties.
By contrast, proletarian or Soviet democracy, instead of the formal proclamation of rights and liberties, guaran-tees them in practice first and foremost to those classes of the population who were oppressed by capitalism, i.
e.
, the proletariat and the peasantry.
For this purpose, the Soviet power expropriates from the bourgeoisie premises, printing presses and stocks of paper, and places them at the entire disposal of the working people and their organisa-tions.
The task of the Russian Communist Party is to draw ever wider masses of working people into the exercise of their democratic rights and liberties, and to extend the material possibilities for this.

ZINOVIEV April 30, 1919 Comrade Zinoviev, Talking with Comrade Yemelyanov, I was particularly struck by the fact that such best and most reliable Petro-grad workers are wasting themselves on technical work like road transport.
This is unforgivable! For technical work we can hire and take ninth-rate men and strangers, i.
e.
, those whose honesty is not known.
But men like Yemelyanov should be sent into the countryside, into the administration, into manage-ment, into the uyezd executive committees, where honest men are few and far between, where the need for honest men is desperate.
Could we form a sponsoring group of workers in Petrograd, consisting of Comrade Yemelyanov and 5 or 10 of his friends, to select 300-600 Petrograd workers, with the most solid references from the Party and the trade unions, for dispatch, singly or in pairs, to uyezd executive committees throughout Russia? I should support this plan in every possible way.
All such men (too old to go to the front) should be taken off technical work and posts where they can be replaced, and transferred to administrative work in the countryside.
With-out a group of such absolutely reliable and experienced Petrograd workers we shall not be able to bring about any big improvement in the villages.

We found it impossible to send him, and have sent another who has already left, and is being delayed only for technical reasons; he should soon reach you.
By the way, let me add for myself that you are, of course, right in beginning negotiations with the Entente.
They should be begun and carried on; it is necessary to make the fullest possible use of every opportunity to ob-tain a temporary armistice or peace, in order to give the people a breathing space.
But do not trust the Entente powers for a moment.
They are deceiving you, and are only attempting to gain time in order to be able to crush you and us.
Try and organise postal communications with us by air.
Best regards, Lenin Comrade Chicherin, please have this translated and sent to Bela Kun.

ZINOVIEV’S ARTICLE “ON THE NUMERICAL COMPOSITION OF OUR PARTY” Comrade Zinoviev has sent me this article, with the request that I send it on to the Moscow press.
I fulfil his request with great pleasure.
The article, in my opinion, deserves to be reprinted in all the newspapers.
All Party comrades ought to read it, and should everywhere, follow-ing the example of Petrograd, start simultaneously both purging the Party of “hangers-on” and intensively recruit-ing to the Party all the best elements among the mass of workers and peasants.

The best way to avoid a complaint is to secure an exact reply or immediate performance; 2) by this means we can and should secure rapid deci-sions in substance, without red tape, namely: by proposing a short method of solution on the spot, proposing it of-ficially (“collect the material in such-and-such a place, I suggest that an order be placed at such-and-such an of-fice, I request that such-and-such be done to avoid bureau-cratic delay”); such a statement or request will greatly assist the centre in combating red tape; 3) against the Council of People’s Commissars and the Council of Defence 584 to go to the All-Russia Central Exec-utive Committee; 4) after endorsement by the C.

Printed from the originalINTRODUCTION TO THE BOOK BY JOHN REED: TEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WORLD INTRODUCTION TO THE AMERICAN EDITION With the greatest interest and with never slackening attention I read John Reed’s book, Ten Days That Shook the World.
Unreservedly do I recommend it to the workers of the world.
Here is a book which I should like to see pub-lished in millions of copies and translated into all languages.
It gives a truthful and most vivid exposition of the events so significant to the comprehension of what really is the Proletarian Revolution and the Dictatorship of the Pro-letariat.
These problems are widely discussed, but before one can accept or reject these ideas, he must understand the full significance of his decision.
John Reed’s book will undoubtedly help to clear this question, which is the fun-damental problem of the international labor movement.
Nikolai Lenin Written at the end of 1 9 1 9 First published in Russian in 1 9 2 3 in the book: Dzhon Rid, 10 dnei kotoriye potryasli mir, Moscow Printed from the book text190 SPEECH AT A MEETING OF THE COMMUNIST GROUP IN THE ALL-RUSSIA CENTRAL COUNCIL OF TRADE UNIONS MARCH 15, 1920 586 MINUTES Comrades, Comrade Lozovsky said that Comrade Bukharin and I will be partly in agreement with him.
That is true.
You have written the theses, but what are you defending? Then you must strike out your theses, because they say: “as a basic principle”, but we do not take practice as our point of departure.
So write that down, then.
What in that case remains of your theses? Today I had occasion to be at a meeting of the water transport workers, and to argue there, and Comrade Ishchenko said: “In any case, there is a guar-antee that we shall put the question as practical men.
” All right then, put that down; but what you have written is something different.
You have written: “as a basic prin-ciple”.
Where is your justification, who is defending it? No one.
They edge away.
Write that down, and then half our differences will disappear.
And after all, what you have written is untrue: where do you answer the argument which is put forward against collective management; where is the participation of the broad masses, with three, five or seven workers taking part in the collegiums? Do you want participation by the broad masses or don’t you? Of course, those who don’t want it are to be thrown out, but that is no argument.
You say, the “broad non-Party masses of workers”.
There are no such masses in a single col-legium: it’s not true, and that’s no way to reason.
That is not the system you need to draw in the broad non-Party masses: you have to train, to promote, to enliven.
How many workers have the Central Committee of the textile workers and others put forward? How many of them have been promoted and how many demoted during the last three months? Give me figures, and then I will say: there are the people.
It’s childish to write “principles”: after studying it for two years, all you have written are princi--ples—people will laugh.
Here your argument does not correspond to your conclusion: participation of the broad masses is assured by a collegium of seven, or of three, per-sons.
People will laugh at it.
That is my first objection.
Secondly, I refer you to the bourgeoisie.
Whom shall we learn from, if not the bourgeoisie? How did they man-age? They managed as a class when it was the ruler, but didn’t it appoint managers? We haven’t yet caught up with them in their degree of development.
They knew how to rule as a class, and to manage through anyone you please individually, entirely in their own interests; at the top they had a small collegium and they didn’t discuss basic principles and didn’t write such resolutions.
They had all power in their hands, and regarded as competent the one who knew his job.
The workers have not yet reached that point, and in order to win we must give up our old prejudices.
The rule of the working class is reflected in the constitution, the ownership and in the fact that it is we who are running things, while management is quite another matter, it is a question of skill, a question of ex-perience.
The bourgeoisie understood this perfectly, but we have not yet realised it.
Let’s get down to learning.
We have already said here that we must hold power firmly in our hands, but we haven’t yet learned how to manage; we have to do a great deal to learn the business of management.
My third argument: competence.
How can you show that it is possible to manage without being competent, to manage without full knowledge, without knowledge of the science of management? It is ridiculous! What sort of sys-tem is it? Why all the words that you have spoken here? In order to manage, one must know the job and be asplendid administrator.
Where does it say that for this reason we need collective management? The fact that we have few experienced workers proves the contrary; what follows is that collective management is intolerable.
In that case, adopt theses in which you say: keep a commissar or a com-mission, etc.
, attached to every expert.
So long as we lack the principle of competence and respect for the expert, we remain at the primitive level.
In that way we shall never create any industrial front.
Unity of will! Without this there is no dictatorship at the front, but dawdling.
You know it is a typical result, that there is friction there, not management.
Appoint an expert with experience; but we know by now that when we combine a competent person with an incompetent one in a collegium, we create a mul-titude of wills and complete confusion.
That is my fifth argument.
* Everyone is writing resolutions about each person being answerable for his own job.
But where is this being carried out? Let them say: where did we divide responsi-bility according to that principle? We have been learning for two years how to run the state, and still write: “the basic prin-ciple.
” This is ridiculous, this is on the second-form level; but let’s have your experience, and we shall see from it to what extent you are competent people and where the lack of competence tells.
They say that under the artil-lery department the works managements were poor.
That is the example Lozovsky and Tomsky have quoted.
When was this? Comrade Lozovsky, we have to reckon with the condition of the Soviet Republic.
What did we begin with, who was at the head? Krylenko, Dybenko and Podvoisky, before we had Trotsky—and that was our collective man-agement.
And if Kolchak and Denikin lambasted us, why did they? Because while we had seven men in charge, we had to learn for two years, and after that we went over to one-man management.
Do we have to reckon with this, or not? Of course, it’s only a trifle, you’ve just taken the two years’ history of the Republic and crossed it out.
Why? You don’t like it, do you? Do it all over again.
And what about Rykov: he was appointed Extraordinary Plenipoten-* Evidently there was a fourth argument against collective man-agement, but it did not find reflection in the minutes.
—Ed.
tiary for Soviet Defence, and Rykov began dragging things out of the mess by himself.
You don’t know your own his-tory, the history of your Supreme Economic Council and of the Soviet Republic.
History tells us that from collective management by the workers we went over to management by tens, we broke our necks, and Kolchak lambasted us, and it was a good thing he did, because we learned something thereby, we learned that collective management must be held in a tight grip.
We have described four systems: ac-cept these four systems, 587 accept the C.
C.
theses.
Then you will be taking your stand on the groundwork of the two years’ history of the Soviet power, of its experience, and not on arguments which are primitive, which will muddle you .

.
* for an adult worker, who is not afraid of any ex-pert and says, “if you put experienced people in charge, our machinery will run ” .
That is how an adult workman reasons, while the timid ones say: “I’m afraid that I shall be left without an expert.
” That is a sign of weakness.
Stop whining, and be your age.

June 4 Comrade Botin, When you called on me today I had only two minutes, because I had to go back to an important meeting.
Now I have a quarter of an hour free, and therefore can (and must) tell you in more detail and more clearly that mistakes have obviously been made, and that you should frankly, honestly and resolutely repudiate these mistakes.
Otherwise a most important undertaking will be ruined.
The mistake was, firstly, that there was distrust of the “expert”, which prevented his being told everything at once and speedy organisation of the experiment; secondly, that the “spade” or preparatory work was done by you personally, which distracted you from the real work, when the whole mass of the “spade”, i.
e.
, preparatory, work must be passed on to the mechanics, assembly-men, electri-cians, etc.
, of whom we can find a dozen.
And to separate your real work from the preparatory or auxiliary jobs, the constant advice of an “expert” is necessary.
Now you have promised me to have full trust in the “ex-pert”, and I believe that you have been entirely convinced of his Party attitude and his absolute loyalty to the revo-lution.
So I must ask you to fulfil your promise to me in its entirety (otherwise the mistakes will be inevitably re-peated).
Tomorrow morning, therefore, show everything to the “expert” and tell him how matters stand (while your assistants are bringing up the cars and doing the preparatory work).
Then, together with the “expert”, the experiments will be carried through without further delays.
Please reply to me that you promise to do this.

BUKHARIN A vast amount of material, particularly on the foreign policy of the Entente, is published every week in our news-papers and in foreign ones (not only communist, but also bourgeois papers of various countries).
This material (see also the Bulletin of the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs) is lost for international communist agitation; yet it is extremely valuable.
I suggest that a committee be set up to summarise this material and publish monthly booklets.
The content: the facts of the foreign policy of the En-tente (plunder; wars; insurrections; financial strangulation).
The number of copies: as small as possible, since the main aim is translation into other languages.
A subcommittee of a few professors should (under strict control) collect all that is valuable, particularly from the bourgeois newspapers (which best of all expose their “ri-vals ” ).
A committee of Party comrades will read the professors’ manuscripts to correct them, and make the professors do that.
Newspapers get lost; booklets will remain, and will help the foreign comrades.

I think it ought to be translated into the European languages.
Let me make a small remark.
To turn it into a textbook (and it should become one), it needs to be supplemented with a chronological index.
This is what I mean: do it approx-imately in this way (1) a column of dates; (2) a column of bourgeois assessments (briefly); (3) a column of your, Marxist assessment, with references to the pages of your book.
Pupils should know both your book and the index, so that there should be no superficiality, so that they should know the facts, so that they should learn to compare the old science and the new.

7 9 ! Printed from the originalON THE KRONSTADT REVOLT SUMMARY OF A TALK WITH A CORRESPONDENT of THE NEW YORK HERALD I believe that there are only two kinds of government possible in Russia—a Government by the Soviets or a Gov-ernment headed by a tsar.
Some fools or traitors in Kron-stadt talked of a Constituent Assembly, but does any man in his senses believe for a moment that a Constituent As-sembly at this critical abnormal stage would be anything but a bear garden.
This Kronstadt affair in itself is a very petty incident.
It no more threatens to break up the Soviet state than the Irish disorders are threatening to break up the British Empire.
Some people in America have come to think of the Bol-sheviks as a small clique of very bad men who are tyran-nizing over a vast number of highly intellectual people who would form an admirable Government among them-selves the moment the Bolshevik regime was overthrown.
This is a mistake, for there is nobody to take our place save butcher Generals and helpless bureaucrats who have al-ready displayed their total incapacity for rule.
If people abroad exaggerate the importance of the rising in Kronstadt and give it support, it is because the world has broken up into two camps: capitalism abroad and Com-munist Russia.

Consequence: in its hands is a commodity stock and its wholesale (railway) transport.

How does it sell? Through whom? Through a commission agent (= a trader) for his percent-age on commission.
It gives preference to the co-operatives (trying to organ-ise the entire population in them).
Why is this impossible? Yet this is capitalism&socialism.

GORBUNOV September 3 Comrade Gorbunov, I have just signed credentials for the chairman and mem-bers of the Extraordinary Commission for Exports of the Council of Labour and Defence 606 (Rykunov, Pyatigorsky, Valayev and Vladimir Spiridonovich Yermakov).
It will be your task to study the membership of this Commission and its terms of reference, then systematically to review its activity and its reports, and to inform me.
I take advantage of this opportunity to point out to you the need for a proper division of labour between you and Smolyaninov (and Boris Volin, if we succeed in get-ting him), and proper organisation of the whole work of the office of the Council of People’s Commissars find the Council of Labour and Defence.
The functions should be clearly demarcated between your-self and Smolyaninov.
Each must “carry on supervision” of specified undertakings (electric ploughs; Hydropeat Board; collective supply; wage rates, etc.
, etc.
).
For each subject, both “old” and newly arising, there must be systematic filing of all papers and reference notes, so that it should always be easy to find what is required.
In addition to the distribution between you of the busi-ness of the “economic front”, the most important front at the present time, there should also be a division between you (or you should take them all on yourself) of the non-economic People’s Commissariats, “following up” their work on the basis of the reports of the gubernia and uyezd economic conferences and otherwise.
On each “subject” it is necessary from time to time (once a week, once a month or every two months, according to the nature and importance of the business—and then also suddenly) to carry out a check on actual fulfilment.
This is most important and most essential.
A record should be made of the results of each check-up.
I think that when there are three of you (you&Smolya-ninov&B.
Volin or someone else, if we can’t have Volin) this will be enough (with a few office assistants) to carry on the whole work, of course on condition of absolute ef-ficiency, on the one hand, and of referring everything that can and should be referred to Ekonomicheskaya Zhizn, to the State Planning Commission and other appropriate insti-tutions, on the other.
To read the uyezd reports it will be necessary to recruit a number of other people, each being obliged to sign that he has read it, on a sheet attached to each report: we shall draw in both writers and some of the oldest members of the Party, as well as some “experts”.
When the number of reports arriving begins to grow, you will draw up a list of “helpers in the reading of reports” and establish a strict procedure for returning what has been read.
Take a typed copy of this letter, and send it to me, to-gether with your reply about a plan for distributing and carrying on all the work of the Executive Secretary of the C.
P.
C.
and the Council of Labour and Defence.
In particular, it is necessary to follow up with special attention the work of the Hydropeat Board, both in connection with the orders for peat pumps already placed abroad for the 1922 season, and in connection with the recent com-munication from R.
E.
Klasson that he has solved the problem of dehydration.
607 Then I ask you to investigate the affair of the idleness of the Swedish works, Nydqvist och Holms (Ekonomiches-kaya Zhizn No.
194, p.
4).
608 “They were slow in getting out” the order for water-driven turbines! Of which we have a terrible lack! This is the height of disgrace and shameless-ness! Make sure to find out who is to blame so that we can send these scoundrels to rot in prison.
Find out who precisely is personally responsible for the work of this factory, and for the orders placed with it.
Altogether, the establishment of specified personal re-sponsibility is the most important job for the Executive Secretary of the C.
P.
C.
and the Council of Labour and Defence.
I will require this more strictly than anything else.
If it proves necessary, call in immediately for this purpose the People’s Commissariat for Justice, and the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, or an “expert” from them.
One more thing.
It seems to me that the Scientific and Technical Department of the Supreme Economic Council has fallen asleep altogether.
It is essential either to wake it up, or really to set going a drive to disperse these scien-tific loafers, and establish precisely and without fail who will be responsible for keeping us abreast of European and American techniques sensibly, in good time, practically, not bureaucratically.
In particular, Moscow should have one specimen of all the most important latest machines: to learn and to teach.
(Two engineers have told me that in America they make roads with a machine which transforms a dirt road into a hard road simply by the force of its own pressure; how important this would be for our roadless semi-civilised country!) We must see that the Scientific and Technical Depart-ment of the Supreme Economic Council, and its numerous idlers abroad, should stop idling, or that we should replace them by others.

).
The col-lection and analysis of information coming, not only from the Chief Boards, but from these organs operating on the spot, must become one of the most important tasks of Eko-nomicheskaya Zhizn.

With communist greetings, Lenin As regards storage.
Let’s decree: Workers in stores receive a bonus for clearing 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 of the store if they dispatch (deliver) its contents di-rectly to state productive enterprises (factories, state farms, and the like).
The same bonus is given to those drawing these materials from the stores for delivery to the same factories, etc.
Unless there is personal interest, no damned thing will come of it.
We must find a way to produce incentives.

KURSKY ON THE QUESTION OF LEASES AND CONCESSIONS IN AGRICULTURE 614 Comrade Kursky, You should go deeply into the question of leases and concessions in agriculture.
You have not gone into it sufficiently Prohibition of leasing in principle is of vast importance.
He who works the land has possession of it.
There must be no leasing.
But leasing of a state farm or “uncultivated land”? This must be separated out This is a special type.
Whoever works has possession here too.
The state is the owner, the tenant of the state farm cultivates.
This is, strictly speaking, not a tenant, nor is it a lease in the ordinary sense.
Rather it is transfer of management.
It is essential to make a more detailed and circumstantial study of the matter.

TSYURUPA Very urgent Avanesov, Kursky and Tsyurupa I suspect a small military stratagem on the part of Osinsky and Bogdanov, who today, in my absence, are rais-ing the question of reversing the decision of the Council of Labour and Defence about the prosecution of persons guilty of bureaucratic delays in the manufacture of the Fowler ploughs.
6 2 3 Please give attention to this matter, and use your influence against reversing the decision.
There is no doubt that in this affair there are people guilty of red tape, and from the standpoint of principle it is essential not to leave such matters within the confines of bureaucratic institutions, but to bring them out into the public court—not so much for the sake of inflicting strict punishment (perhaps a reprimand will suffice), but for the sake of publicity and for dispelling the universal con-viction that guilty persons are not punished.
December 13, 1921 Lenin Dictated by telephone First published in 1 9 2 8 in Lenin Miscellany VIII Printed from a typescript copyTO P.
A.
BOGDANOV December 23, 1921 Comrade Bogdanov, I consider all your arguments about the Fowler ploughs affair to be completely wrong in principle.
True, your error is not so indecent (excuse my strong language) as that of Osinsky, who has frankly become a defender of the worst kind of bureaucracy; nevertheless what you say does not look good either.
We must not be afraid of the courts (our courts are pro-letarian) or of publicity, but must drag bureaucratic delays out into daylight for the people’s judgement: only in this way shall we manage to really cure this disease.
Your argument is that the people involved are excep-tionally good, devoted and valuable workers.
Let’s suppose that this is true, that you are not a victim of “departmental bias”.
What follows from this? Only this, that the court—if it agrees with you in this respect (and you, probably, since you firmly believe it, will present a number of most serious witnesses to prove it)—will bring in a verdict that: they are guilty of failing to eliminate bureaucratic delays and of mismanagement; but, taking into account their exceptional loyalty to the Soviet pow-er, completely proved by a number of witnesses, their outstanding conscientiousness and zeal, also completely proved, taking into account the general defects in the machinery of the Supreme Economic Council, partly due to the change of Presidium, etc.
.
.
.
decides not to inflict any punishment, in the belief that the accused will take this seriously to heart, as will the entire Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council.
Well, if approximately such a decision were taken, can you deny its usefulness—it’s social significance, 1,000 times greater than a secret-Party-Central-Committee-idiotic hush-ing up of a rotten case about rotten bureaucracy and avoid-ing publicity? You are absolutely wrong in principle.
We don’t know how to conduct a public trial for rotten bureaucracy: for this all of us, and particularly the People’s Commissariat for Justice, should be hung on stinking ropes.
And I have not yet lost all hope that one day we shall be hung for this, and deservedly so.
If you think that in the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
we cannot find a single sensible prosecutor and three sensible judges, really sensible (not over-hasty, not shouters, not phrase-mongers), then I accuse you also of pessimism about the Soviet power.
I am sending a copy of this letter (together with your letter) to Comrade Kursky, with a special request that he read it himself and let it be read by as many jurists as possible, and that he, Kursky, should consider himself specifically responsible for selecting an unquestionably sensible prose-cutor and sensible judges for this trial.
And that Kursky should be personally responsible for (1) the maximum ac-celeration of the proceedings and (2) letting me have a stenographic report of this trial (to draw the conclusion as to whether at last our very feeble People’s Commissariat for Justice is learning to organise and carry through public trials of bureaucracy).
It is time we began to learn.
I don’t understand why a sensible prosecutor should not in face of the whole public completely shatter, ridicule and disgrace a “Bogdanovist” and “Osinskyist” defence of bureaucratic red tape, and at the same time draw up a wise, correct and balanced charge.
Why should not a sentence be possible approximately on the following lines: Attaching exceptional importance to the public trial of cases of bureaucratic delay, we hand down in this case a very lenient sentence, in view of theexceptionally rare conscientiousness of the accused; at the same time giving a warning that in future we shall punish for such delays the most saintly, but negligent dunderheads (the court perhaps will ex-press itself more politely), because we, the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
, do not need saintliness, but efficient management.
And, therefore, if we inflict no penalty on this occasion on Lomov and Styunkel 6 2 4 on account of their “saintliness”, we sentence Unksov 625 (I think that’s the name?), whose duty it was to submit reports to the Council of Labour and Defence and who failed to do so, to a week’s arrest; we proclaim Ilyin626 (director of the former Ilyin factory?) and the entire works committee of this factory, and the entire executive of the (corresponding) trade union, and the entire membership of the communist group of such-and-such a factory, or such-and-such fac-tories, guilty of red tape, negligence and conniv-ance at bureaucracy, and inflict on them a severe reprimand and public censure, with a warning that it is only for this first time that we are inflicting such mild penalties, but in future will for such behaviour send all such trade union and communist scoundrels (the court, perhaps, will express itself more mildly) mercilessly to jail.
With communist greetings, V.

That a number of articles be printed in Pravda and Izvestia, giving a reminder of the fate of the Basle Mani-festo and a detailed explanation of all the childishness or all the social-treachery, now being repeated by the metal-workers.
2.
That at the next enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the Comintern there be put on the agenda the question of struggle against war, and that circumstantial resolutions be adopted explaining that only a ready and experienced revolutionary party, with a good illegal ma-chinery, can successfully wage a struggle against war, and that the means of struggle is not a strike against war, but the formation of revolutionary groups in the warring armies and their preparation for the carrying out of a revolution.

February 20, 1922 Comrade Kursky, The activity of the People’s Commissariat for Justice is apparently not yet at all adapted to the New Economic Policy.
Previously, the militant organs of the Soviet power were chiefly the People’s Commissariat for the Army and the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission.
An especially mili-tant role now falls to the People’s Commissariat for Justice (P.
C.
J.
); unfortunately, there is no evidence of any un-derstanding of this on the part of the leadership and the senior members of the P.
C.
J.
Intensification of reprisals against the political enemies of the Soviet power and the agents of the bourgeoisie (spe-cifically the Mensheviks and S.
R.
s); mounting of these reprisals by revolutionary tribunals and people’s courts in the swiftest, most revolutionary and expedient manner;compulsory staging of a number of model (as regards speed and force of repression, and explanation of their significance to the masses of people through the courts and the press) trials in Moscow, Petrograd, Kharkov and several other key centres; influence on the people’s judges and members of revolutionary tribunals through the Party in the sense of improving the activity of the courts and intensifying the reprisals—all of this must be conducted systematically, persistently, with doggedness and mandatory reports (in the most concise, telegraphic style but business-like and exact, with obligatory statistics of how the P.
C.
J.
chastises and learns to chastise the “communist” scoundrels who predominate among us and who know how to chatter and put on airs, but not how to work).
The fighting role of the P.
C.
J.
is equally important in the sphere of NEP, and here the P.
C.
J.
’s weakness and apathy is even more outrageous.
There is no evidence of any understanding of the fact that we recognise and will continue to recognise only state capitalism, and it is we— we conscious workers, we Communists—who are the state.
That is why we should brand as good-for-nothing Commu-nists those who have failed to understand their task of restricting, curbing, checking and catching red-handed and inflicting exemplary chastisement on any kind of capital-ism that goes beyond the framework of state capitalism in our meaning of the concept and tasks of the state.
It is the P.
C.
J.
, it is the people’s courts that are here faced with an especially militant and especially respon-sible task.
There is no sign that it has been grasped.
The papers make noises about the abuse of NEP.
These abuses are innumerable.
But where is the noise about model trials of the scoun-drels abusing the New Economic Policy? There is no such noise, because there are no such trials.
The P.
C.
J.
has “forgotten” that that is its business, that it is its duty to pull up, shake up and rouse the people’s courts and teach them to be ruthless and swift in chastising—with every means, including the firing squad—for abuse of the New Economic Policy.
It is responsible for this.
There is no evidence of any vibrant activity in this sphere on the part of the P.
C.
J.
, because there is no such activity.
The educational role of the courts is tremendous.
How do we show concern for this? How do we take account of the real results? There is nothing of the sort, but that happens to be the ABC of juridical work.
It is just as elementary that triple penalties should be inflicted on Communists, as compared with non-Party people.
There again the P.
C.
J.
has shown little concern.
Under the tsar, the procurators were sacked or promoted on the strength of the percentage of cases they won.
We managed to adopt the worst of tsarist Russia—red tape and sluggishness—and this is virtually stifling us, but we failed to adopt its good practices.
Every member of the P.
C.
J.
Collegium, every worker of this Commissariat should be assessed according to his record, on the strength of the fol-lowing figures: how many Communists have you jailed with triple sentences, as compared with non-Party people, for the same offences? How many bureaucrats have you jailed for red tape and procrastination? How many merchants caught abusing NEP have you sentenced to be shot or to some other no-joke penalty (for ridiculous penalties are frequently imposed in Moscow, under the very nose of the P.
C.
J.
)? You can’t answer the question? This means that you are an idler who should be expelled from the Party for “communist chatter” and for “communist conceit”.
The new civil legislation is being drafted.
I find that the P.
C.
J.
is “swimming with the tide ” .
But its task is to swim against the tide.
Its task is to create a new civil law, and not to adopt (rather, not to allow itself to be duped by the old and stupid bourgeois lawyers who adopt) the old, bour-geois concept of civil law.
It should not give in to the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, which “ex officio” conducts the line of “adaptation to Europe”, but combat this line and work out a new civil law, a new attitude to “private” con-tracts, etc.
We do not recognise anything “private”, and regard everything in the economic sphere as falling under public and not private law.
We allow only state capitalism, and as has been said, it is we who are the state.
Hence, the task is to extend the application of state intervention in “private legal” relations; to extend the right of the state to annul “private” contracts; to apply to “civil legal relations”not the corpus juris romani but our revolutionary concept of law; to show systematically, persistently, with determina-tion, through a series of model trials, how this should be done wisely and vigorously; to brand through the Party and expel those members of revolutionary tribunals and people’s judges who fail to learn this .
or refuse to under-stand it.
Unless the P.
C.
J.
rouses itself at once and vigorously starts working in a new, militant way, along new lines, it will be disgraced before Genoa (and the whole world).
I propose to you that 1) you read my letter to all members of the P.

, in such-and-such a gubernia or such-and-such a district of Moscow.
What we need is not a division of “departments” and bureaucratic slumber on that, but personal responsibility on the part of every Communist on the Collegium for a specific area of live revolutionary work.
That is what the People’s Commissar must achieve and prove that he is ca-pable of achieving it.

TSYURUPA ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DRAFT DIRECTIVES 628 TO THE NARROW COUNCIL OF PEOPLE’S COMMISSARS Comrade Tsyurupa, I think we are still radically at odds.
The main thing, in my opinion, is to shift the centre of gravity from writing decrees and orders (our stupidities in this respect verge on idiocy) to selection of people and checking fulfilment.
This is the essential point.
Is the Narrow Council unsuitable for this? Let’s assume that.
Then you and Rykov must devote 9/10ths of your time to it (it is ridiculous to expect the Workers’ and Peas-ants’ Inspection and the Executive Secretary to do more than fulfil simple instructions).
All of us are sunk in the rotten bureaucratic swamp of “departments”.
Great author-ity, common sense and strong will are necessary for the everyday struggle against this.
The departments are shit; decrees are shit.
To find men and check up on their work— that is the whole point.
If you&Rykov set about this for 9/10ths of your time, and make the Executive Secretary (and sometimes also members of the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars) your assistants, then perhaps we can get by.
Send me once again your draft about the Narrow Council of People’s Commissars.

SHEINMAN February 28 Comrade Sheinman, Your words that the State Bank is now a “powerful ap-paratus” (Feb.
22) made me laugh.
Let me say in confidence: this is the height of childishness, the height of Communist-mandarin childishness.
A “powerful apparatus”! The “powerful apparatus”= transferring from one state pocket into another such remark-able “real values” as Soviet rubles.
.
.
.
Current accounts expressed in gold rubles (and even that falsely, not at the real parity) 2.
8-7.
9-10.
3 million rubles (on Dec.
16, Jan.
16, and Feb.
1).
Ha-ha! And how are they made up? 90-98 per cent are revenues from our state trusts, i.
e.
, the same official bits of paper from the same bureaucrats! At present the State Bank= a bureaucratic paper game.
There is the truth for you, if you want to hear not the sweet communist-official lies (with which everyone feeds you as a high mandarin), but the truth.
And if you don’t want to look at this truth with open eyes, through all the communist lying, you are a man who has perished in the prime of life in a swamp of official lying.
Now that is an unpleasant truth, but it is the truth.
Either to seek and gradually to find (testing and checking one hundred times) people capable of organising trade on behalf of the State Bank, checking on trade, encouraging business-like traders, closing down allegedly commercial, but in reality communist-bureaucratic trading and factory “Potemkin villages” 629—or the entire State Bank and all its work is zero, worse than zero, self-deception with a new bureaucratic rattle.
And until you prove to me by acts, backed up by expe-rience, that the State Bank has begun to find such men, inspectors, agents, etc.
, until then there is nothing to talk about: I won’t believe a word you say.
Please don’t be angry for this frankness.

TIKHOMIROV 630 Copies to Comrades Molotov and Tsyurupa Comrade Tikhomirov, In my opinion, no alterations are needed.
It is not the co-operative movement that should be adapt-ed to the New Economic Policy, but the New Economic Policy to the co-operative movement.
The parallel with the trade unions is incorrect, a par-allel with the Soviets would be nearer the truth.
The old structure should be retained.
All attention and all effort should be concentrated on selecting people (this is our weak spot), and getting the better of private trade.
Everything towards this end.
No reorganisations.
Are there any practical successes? I am afraid, not.

SKVORTSOV-STEPANOV March 19 Comrade Stepanov, I have just finished looking through 160 pages of your book.
631 Just as I was furious in cursing you (up to and including bad language) for being able at such a time to spend months over refuting Cunow, 632 so I am delighted with this book.
Now this is a real achievement! Now this is a model of how one should teach the Russian savage from the ABC onwards, and to teach him not a “half-science” but the whole of science.
Write (after you have had a proper rest) another such little book on the history of religion and against all reli-gion (including the Kantian and other subtly idealistic or subtly agnostic religion), with a survey of material on the history of atheism and on the links between the church and the bourgeoisie.
Once more: greetings and congratulations on a splendid success.

The whiteguards (including the Mensheviks and S.

(β) Exit from the war: a revolutionary exit from a reac-tionary war.
And what about them? (γ) The Soviet state.
The first in the world.
A new epoch: worse than the first locomotive! The three are inseparable.
The fourth, and main one, is not finished: laying the foundations of a socialist economy.
To be redone again and again.

What “link in the chain” must we get hold of now? 1917—withdrawal from the war, 1918—Soviet state versus Con-stituent Assembly.
1919 and 1920—repelling inva-sion.
1921: economic approach to the peasantry.
The search for an economic policy.
1922: The essential is not in institutions, not in reorgani-sations, not in new decrees, but in the selection of personnel and in checking performance.
Selection of personnel and checking performance.
On three (3) conditions: (α) Absence of interven-tion.
With Mensheviks and S.

KURSKY Top Secret Comrade Kursky, People’s Commissariat for Justice Copy to Comrade Krylenko On my instructions, the former Moscow Extraordinary Commission began an investigation into the criminal negli-gence, red tape and inactivity displayed by the Scientific and Technical Department and the Inventions Committee.
The results of the investigation were put before the Mos-cow Revolutionary Tribunal which, instead of examining the case in substance, discovering and punishing the guilty (and that in these institutions there are a sufficient number of learned wastrels, loafers and other scoundrels, has been noted more than once in the press, in the articles by Comrade Sosnovsky and others), adopted an extremely patronising attitude to the accused, tried them without a prosecutor, and in the end found the charge not proven and acquitted all the accused.
At the present time I have been informed that the Moscow Gubernia Branch of the State Political Department has appealed against the decision of the Moscow Revolutionary Tribunal to the Judiciary Supervision Section of the People’s Commissariat for Justice.
I ask you to study this case per-sonally, pay particular attention to it, try together with the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection to collect supple-mentary material on the activity of these institutions, if necessary appoint an investigating committee by agreement with Comrade Avanesov—not composed of officials and drivellers, but of people who really know how to investi-gate properly, to procure the material required and findthe culprits.
A political trial should be mounted in the Revolutionary Tribunal (making use of Comrade Sosnovsky for the press) to really shake up this “scientific” swamp.
I suggest that the Moscow Revolutionary Tribunal be severely reprimanded for its indulgence and formal bureau-cratic handling of the case.

OSINSKY 1) The Editorial Board of Pravda Copies to 2) Comrade Steklov 3) Rykov and Tsyurupa April 12, 1922 Comrade Osinsky, I very much welcome your article in today’s Pravda: “New Data from Local Experience”.
It is just such articles that we need most of all, and I think that every People’s Commissariat ought to “provide itself ” with a publicist (very closely connected with the work of the People’s Commissariat and the People’s Commissar) to make such reviews.
The worst of our features is an excess of general disqui-sitions in the press, and political prattle with an extreme lack of study of local experience.
Both in the provinces and in the centre, powerful tendencies resist its truthful publicity and truthful evaluation.
They are afraid of wash-ing dirty linen in public, afraid of the naked truth, and brush it aside with a meaningful glance, taking a superfi-cial attitude, as Comrade Trotsky correctly said.
We need more and more concreteness in studying local experience, details, the little things, practice, business-like experience, going deeply into real life—uyezd, volost and village; examination of what, where, by whom and why (by what means) success is achieved, in spite of the abyss of poverty and ruin, in reaching genuine improve-ment, even if on a small scale, and courage to unmask mistakes and incapacity, popularising and advertising with all our strength every local worker who is in any way out-standing, and making him a model.
The more such work is done, the deeper we go into living practice, distracting the attention of both ourselves and our readers from the stinking bureaucratic and stinking intellectual Moscow (and, in general, Soviet bourgeois) atmosphere, the greater will be our success in improving both our press and all our constructive work.
Once again I welcome your initiative, and very much wish that you should continue it further, on a wider scale and more deeply in the same direction.

I very much regret that Tsyurupa did not manage to do any work in the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection.
641 I am afraid that the work is not quite rightly organised.
The type of work is individual investigations and reports.
This is old hat.
But there is no reorganisation of the machin-ery or its improvement.
There are no model staffs composed entirely of Communists, or entirely of students of Schools of Soviet and Party Work; there are no systematically worked-out rates of work, which might be applied to other departments; there are no systematic statistical studies of what Soviet employees can do in this or that branch of government in the course of a week, and so forth.
I had constantly hoped that the influx of new people into the Collegium of the W.
P.
I.
would liven up the work, but from my questioning of Stalin I have not been able to see this.
Please write to me, and then we shall organise a meeting, if necessary.
You have a staff of 8,000 instead of 9,000.
Would it not be possible to cut it down to ,000, with salaries for 6,000 (i.
e.
, to treble the payment) and improve their qualifications? If Avanesov arrives soon, show this to him too.

AVANESOV September 1, 1922 Comrade Avanesov, Yesterday I talked it over with Comrade Svidersky, and convinced myself that he too attaches the greatest impor-tance to the “department of normalisation ” .
He has given the job of collecting the literature to Yermansky.
I am somewhat doubtful whether Yermansky will do this suc-cessfully.
He is a Menshevik, and his book shows a certain maliciousness (although the book is nevertheless a good one).
642 Please either check up on his performance of the assignment, or take steps yourself to have it carried out.
Both German and American literature should be obtained.
Everything more or less valuable should be collected, espe-cially as regards normalising bureaucratic work (procedure for dispatch of business; forms; control; typing of copies; inquiries and replies, etc.
, etc.
).
In my opinion, the most necessary thing for us now is to learn from Europe and America.
If I am not mistaken, I have heard that you have an excellent knowledge of Ger-man.
If not, find a translator.
Maybe something useful will be found in the Scandinavian countries also.
Everything must be got together, and don’t rely on Yer-mansky without a special chechup.
Maybe through Krestinsky 643 you will be able to get hold of some unpublished material? Or through the ambas-sador in Norway? I think that we must work out normalisation of paper work, and then apply it everywhere.
This is most impor-tant.
If they allowed you to look at one of the best institutions in Germany or Norway, it would be worth staying over there for a week.
The main thing is norms (i.
e.
, how many people for such-and-such a sum total of work).
After that we shall make our own Central Statistical Board work as well.
Please, after making use of this letter, send it on to A.

percentage of expenditure (to turnover), number of employees, and so forth.

What is the plan or idea or essence of NEP? (α) Retention of the land in the hands of the state; (β) the same for all commanding heights in the sphere of means of production (transport, etc.
); (γ) freedom of trade in the sphere of petty production; (δ) state capitalism in the sense of attracting private capital (both concessions and mixed companies).

9 and as a pamphlet Printed from the shorthand notesI LETTER TO THE CONGRESS I would urge strongly that at this Congress a number of changes be made in our political structure.
I want to tell you of the considerations to which I attach most importance.
At the head of the list I set an increase in the number of Central Committee members to a few dozen or even a hundred.
It is my opinion that without this reform our Central Committee would be in great danger if the course of events were not quite favourable for us (and that is something we cannot count on).
Then, I intend to propose that the Congress should on certain conditions invest the decisions of the State Plan-ning Commission with legislative force, meeting, in this respect, the wishes of Comrade Trotsky—to a certain extent and on certain conditions.
As for the first point, i.
e.
, increasing the number of C.
C.
members, I think it must be done in order to raise the prestige of the Central Committee, to do a thorough job of improving our administrative machinery and to prevent conflicts between small sections of the C.
C.
from acquiring excessive importance for the future of the Party.
It seems to me that our Party has every right to demand from the working class 50 to 100 C.
C.
members, and that it could get them from it without unduly taxing the resources of that class.
Such a reform would considerably increase the stability of our Party and ease its struggle in the encirclement of hostile states, which, in my opinion, is likely to, and must, become much more acute in the next few years.
I thinkthat the stability of our Party would gain a thousandfold by such a measure.

II Continuation of the notes.
December 24, 1922 By stability of the Central Committee, of which I spoke above, I mean measures against a split, as far as such meas-ures can at all be taken.
For, of course, the whiteguard in Russkaya Mysl (it seems to have been S.
S.
Oldenburg) was right when, first, in the whiteguards’ game against Soviet Russia he banked on a split in our Party, and when, secondly, he banked on grave differences in our Party to cause that split.
Our Party relies on two classes and therefore its insta-bility would be possible and its downfall inevitable if there were no agreement between those two classes.
In that event this or that measure, and generally all talk about the sta-bility of our C.
C.
, would be futile.
No measures of any kind could prevent a split in such a case.
But I hope that this is too remote a future and too improbable an event to talk about.
I have in mind stability as a guarantee against a split in the immediate future, and I intend to deal here with a few ideas concerning personal qualities.
I think that from this standpoint the prime factors in the question of stability are such members of the C.
C.
as Stalin and Trotsky.
I think relations between them make up the greater part of the danger of a split, which could be avoided, and this purpose, in my opinion, would be served, among other things, by increasing the number of C.
C.
members to 50 or 100.
Comrade Stalin, having become Secretary-General, has unli-mited authority concentrated in his hands, and I am not surewhether he will always be capable of using that authority with sufficient caution.
Comrade Trotsky, on the other hand, as his struggle against the C.
C.
on the question of the People’s Commissariat for Communications has already proved, is distinguished not only by outstanding ability.
He is personally perhaps the most capable man in the present C.
C.
, but he has displayed excessive self-assurance and shown excessive preoccupation with the purely admin-istrative side of the work.
These two qualities of the two outstanding leaders of the present C.
C.
can inadvertently lead to a split, and if our Party does not take steps to avert this, the split may come unexpectedly.
I shall not give any further appraisals of the personal qualities of other members of the C.
C.
I shall just recall that the October episode with Zinoviev and Kamenev 654 was, of course, no accident, but neither can the blame for it be laid upon them personally, any more than non-Bolshevism can upon Trotsky.
Speaking of the young C.
C.
members, I wish to say a few words about Bukharin and Pyatakov.
They are, in my opinion, the most outstanding figures (among the youngest ones), and the following must be borne in mind about them: Bukharin is not only a most valuable and major theorist of the Party; he is also rightly considered the favourite of the whole Party, but his theoretical views can be classified as fully Marxist only with great reserve, for there is some-thing scholastic about him (he has never made a study of dialectics, and, I think, never fully understood it).
December 25.
As for Pyatakov, he is unquestionably a man of outstanding will and outstanding ability, but shows too much zeal for administrating and the administrative side of the work to be relied upon in a serious political matter.
Both of these remarks, of course, are made only for the present, on the assumption that both these outstanding and devoted Party workers fail to find an occasion to enhance their knowledge and amend their one-sidedness.

ADDITION TO THE LETTER OF DECEMBER 24, 1922 Stalin is too rude and this defect, although quite tolerable in our midst and in dealings among us Communists, becomes intolerable in a Secretary-General.
That is why I suggest that the comrades think about a way of removing Stalin from that post and appointing another man in his stead who in all other respects differs from Comrade Stalin in having only one advantage, namely, that of being more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more considerate to the comrades, less capricious, etc.
This circumstance may appear to be a negligible detail.
But I think that from the standpoint of safeguards against a split and from the standpoint of what I wrote above about the relationship between Stalin and Trotsky it is not a detail, or it is a detail which can assume decisive importance.

December 26, 1922 The increase in the number of C.
C.
members to 50 or even 100 must, in my opinion, serve a double or even a treble purpose: the more members there are in the C.
C.
, the more men will be trained in C.
C.
work and the less dan-ger there will be of a split due to some indiscretion.
The enlistment of many workers to the C.
C.
will help the workers to improve our administrative machinery, which is pretty bad.
We inherited it, in effect, from the old regime, for it was absolutely impossible to reorganise it in such a short time, especially in conditions of war, famine, etc.
That is why those “critics” who point to the defects of our adminis-trative machinery out of mockery or malice may be calmly answered that they do not in the least understand the con-ditions of the revolution today.
It is altogether impossiblein five years to reorganise the machinery adequately, especially in the conditions in which our revolution took place.
It is enough that in five years we have created a new type of state in which the workers are leading the peasants against the bourgeoisie; and in a hostile inter-national environment this in itself is a gigantic achievement.
But knowledge of this must on no account blind us to the fact that, in effect, we took over the old machinery of state from the tsar and the bourgeoisie and that now, with the onset of peace and the satisfaction of the minimum require-ments against famine, all our work must be directed towards improving the administrative machinery.
I think that a few dozen workers, being members of the C.
C.
, can deal better than anybody else with checking, improving and remodelling our state apparatus.
The Work-ers’ and Peasants’ Inspection on whom this function devolved at the beginning proved unable to cope with it and can be used only as an “appendage” or, on certain conditions, as an assistant to these members of the C.
C.
In my opinion, the workers admitted to the Central Committee should come preferably not from among those who have had long service in Soviet bodies (in this part of my letter the term workers everywhere includes peasants), because those workers have already acquired the very traditions and the very prejudices which it is desirable to combat.
The working-class members of the C.
C.
must be mainly workers of a lower stratum than those promoted in the last five years to work in Soviet bodies; they must be people closer to being rank-and-file workers and peasants, who, however, do not fall into the category of direct or indirect exploiters.
I think that by attending all sittings of the C.
C.
and all sittings of the Political Bureau, and by reading all the documents of the C.
C.
, such workers can form a staff of devoted supporters of the Soviet system, able, first, to give stability to the C.
C.
itself, and second, to work effec-tively on the renewal and improvement of the state apparatus.

December 27, 1922 GRANTING LEGISLATIVE FUNCTIONS TO THE STATE PLANNING COMMISSION This idea was suggested by Comrade Trotsky, it seems, quite a long time ago.
I was against it at the time, because I thought that there would then be a fundamental lack of co-ordination in the system of our legislative institutions.
But after closer consideration of the matter I find that in substance there is a sound idea in it, namely: the State Planning Commission stands somewhat apart from our legislative institutions, although, as a body of experienced people, experts, representatives of science and technology, it is actually in a better position to form a correct judge-ment of affairs.
However, we have so far proceeded from the principle that the State Planning Commission must provide the state with critically analysed material and the state institutions must decide state matters.
I think that in the present situation, when affairs of state have become unusually complicated, when it is necessary time and again to settle questions of which some require the expert opinion of the members of the State Planning Commission and some do not, and, what is more, to settle matters which need the expert opinion of the State Planning Commission on some points but not on others—I think that we must now take a step towards extending the competence of the State Planning Commission.
I imagine that step to be such that the decisions of the State Planning Commission could not be rejected by ordi-nary procedure in Soviet bodies, but would need a special procedure to be reconsidered.
For example, the question should be submitted to a session of the All-Russia CentralExecutive Committee, prepared for reconsideration accord-ing to a special instruction, involving the drawing up, under special rules, of memoranda to examine whether the State Planning Commission decision is subject to rever-sal.
Lastly, special time-limits should be set for the reconsideration of State Planning Commission decisions, etc.
In this respect I think we can and must accede to the wishes of Comrade Trotsky, but not in the sense that spe-cifically any one of our political leaders, or the Chairman of the Supreme Economic Council, etc.
, should be Chairman of the State Planning Commission.
I think that personal matters are at present too closely interwoven with the ques-tion of principle.
I think that the attacks which are now made against the Chairman of the State Planning Commis-sion, Comrade Krzhizhanovsky, and Comrade Pyatakov, his deputy, and which proceed along two lines, so that, on the one hand, we hear charges of extreme leniency, lack of independent judgement and lack of backbone, and, on the other, charges of excessive coarseness, drill-sergeant methods, lack of solid scientific background, etc.
—I think these attacks express two sides of the question, exaggerat-ing them to the extreme, and that in actual fact we need a skilful combination in the State Planning Commission of two types of character, of which one may be exemplified by Comrade Pyatakov and the other by Comrade Krzhizha-novsky.
I think that the State Planning Commission must be headed by a man who, on the one hand, has scientific edu-cation, namely, either technical or agronomic, with decades of experience in practical work in the field of technology or of agronomics.
I think this man must possess not so much the qualities of an administrator as broad experience and the ability to enlist the services of other men.
Lenin December 27, 1922 Taken down by M.

V Continuation of the letter on the legislative nature of State Planning Commission decisions.
December 28, 1922 I have noticed that some of our comrades who are able to exercise a decisive influence on the direction of state affairs, exaggerate the administrative side, which, of course, is necessary in its time and place, but which should not be confused with the scientific side, with a grasp of the broad facts, the ability to recruit men, etc.
In every state institution, especially in the State Plan-ning Commission, the combination of these two qualities is essential; and when Comrade Krzhizhanovsky told me that he had enlisted the services of Comrade Pyatakov for the Commission and had come to terms with him about the work, I, in consenting to this, on the one hand, entertained certain doubts and, on the other, sometimes hoped that we would thus get the combination of the two types of states-men.
To see whether those hopes are justified, we must now wait and consider the matter on the strength of some-what longer experience, but in principle, I think, there can be no doubt that such a combination of temperaments and types (of men and qualities) is absolutely necessary for -the correct functioning of state institutions.
I think that here it is just as harmful to exaggerate “administrating” as it is to exaggerate anything at all.
The chief of a state institution must possess a high degree of personal appeal and sufficiently solid scientific and technical knowledge to be able to check people’s work.
That much is basic.
Without it the work cannot be done properly.
On the other hand, it is very important that he should be capable of administer-ing and should have a worthy assistant, or assistants, in the matter.
The combination of these two qualities in one person will hardly be found, and it is hardly necessary.

December 28, 1922VI Continuation of the notes on the State Planning Commission.
December 29, 1922 The State Planning Commission is apparently developing in all respects into a commission of experts.
Such an in-stitution cannot be headed by anybody except a man with great experience and an all-round scientific education in technology.
The administrative element must in essence be subsidiary.
A certain independence and autonomy of the State Planning Commission is essential for the prestige of this scientific institution and depends on one thing, namely, the conscientiousness of its workers and their conscientious desire to turn our plan of economic and social development into reality.
This last quality may, of course, be found now only as an exception, for the overwhelming majority of scientists, who naturally make up the Commission, are inevitably in-fected with bourgeois ideas and bourgeois prejudices.
The check on them from this standpoint must be the job of several persons who can form the Presidium of the Commis-sion.
These must be Communists to keep a day-to-day check on the extent of the bourgeois scientists’ devotion to our cause displayed in the whole course of the work and see that they abandon bourgeois prejudices and gradually adopt the socialist standpoint.
This work along the twin lines of scientific checking and pure administration should be the ideal of those who run the State Planning Commis-sion in our Republic.
Lenin Taken down by M.
V.
December 29, 1922 Is it rational to divide the work of the State Planning Commission into separate jobs? Should we not, on the contrary, try to build up a group of permanent specialistswho would be systematically checked by the Presidium of the Commission and could solve the whole range of prob-lems within its ambit? I think that the latter would be the more reasonable and that we must try to cut down the num-ber of temporary and urgent tasks.

December 29, 1922 (ADDITION TO THE SECTION ON INCREASING THE NUMBER OF C.
C.
MEMBERS) In increasing the number of its members, the C.
C.
, I think, must also, and perhaps mainly, devote attention to checking and improving our administrative machinery, which is no good at all.
For this we must enlist the services of highly qualified specialists, and the task of supplying those specialists must devolve upon the Workers’ and Peas-ants’ Inspection.
How are we to combine these checking specialists, people with adequate knowledge, and the new members of the C.
C.
? This problem must be resolved in practice.
It seems to me that the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspec-tion (as a result of its development and of our perplexity about its development) has led all in all to what we now observe, namely, to an intermediate position between a special People’s Commissariat and a special function of the members of the C.
C.
; between an institution that inspects anything and everything and an aggregate of not very numerous but first-class inspectors, who must be well paid (this is especially indispensable in our age when every-thing must be paid for and inspectors are directly em-ployed by the institutions that pay them better).
If the number of C.
C.
members is increased in the ap-propriate way, and they go through a course of state management year after year with the help of highly qualified specialists and of members of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection who are highly authoritative in every branch— then, I think, we shall successfully solve this problem which we have not managed to do for such a long time.
To sum up, 100 members of the C.
C.
at the most and not more than 400-500 assistants, members of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Inspection, engaged in inspecting under their direction.

December 30, 1922 THE QUESTION OF NATIONALITIES OR “AUTONOMISATION” I suppose I have been very remiss with respect to the workers of Russia for not having intervened energetically and decisively enough in the notorious question of autonomisation, 655 which, it appears, is officially called the question of the union of Soviet socialist republics.
When this question arose last summer, I was ill; and then in autumn I relied too much on my recovery and on the October and December plenary meetings 656 giving me an opportunity of intervening in this question.
However, I did not manage to attend the October Plenary Meeting (when this question came up) or the one in December, and so the question passed me by almost completely.
I have only had time for a talk with Comrade Dzerzhin-sky, who came from the Caucasus and told me how this matter stood in Georgia.
I have also managed to exchange a few words with Comrade Zinoviev and express my ap-prehensions on this matter.
From what I was told by Com-rade Dzerzhinsky, who was at the head of the commission sent by the C.
C.
to “investigate” the Georgian incident, I could only draw the greatest apprehensions.
If matters had come to such a pass that Orjonikidze could go to the extreme of applying physical violence, as Comrade Dzer-zhinsky informed me, we can imagine what a mess we have got ourselves into.
Obviously the whole business of “autonomisation” was radically wrong and badly timed.
It is said that a united apparatus was needed.
Where did that assurance come from? Did it not come from that same Russian apparatus which, as I pointed out in one of the preceding sections of my diary, we took over from tsarism and slightly anointed with Soviet oil?There is no doubt that that measure should have been delayed somewhat until we could say that we vouched for our apparatus as our own.
But now, we must, in all con-science, admit the contrary; the apparatus we call ours is, in fact, still quite alien to us; it is a bourgeois and tsar-ist hotch-potch and there has been no possibility of getting rid of it in the course of the past five years without the help of other countries and because we have been “busy” most of the time with military engagements and the fight against famine.
It is quite natural that in such circumstances the “free-dom to secede from the union” by which we justify our-selves will be a mere scrap of paper, unable to defend the non-Russians from the onslaught of that really Russian man, the Great-Russian chauvinist, in substance a rascal and a tyrant, such as the typical Russian bureaucrat is.
There is no doubt that the infinitesimal percentage of Soviet and sovietised workers will drown in that tide of chauvinistic Great-Russian riffraff like a fly in milk.
It is said in defence of this measure that the People’s Commissariats directly concerned with national psychol-ogy and national education were set up as separate bodies.
But there the question arises: can these People’s Commis-sariats be made quite independent? and secondly: were we careful enough to take measures to provide the non-Russians with a real safeguard against the truly Russian bully? I do not think we took such measures although we could and should have done so.
I think that Stalin’s haste and his infatuation with pure administration, together with his spite against the noto-rious “nationalist-socialism”, played a fatal role here.
In politics spite generally plays the basest of roles.
I also fear that Comrade Dzerzhinsky, who went to the Caucasus to investigate the “crime” of those “nationalist-socialists”, distinguished himself there by his truly Rus-sian frame of mind (it is common knowledge that people of other nationalities who have become Russified overdo this Russian frame of mind) and that the impartiality of his whole commission was typified well enough by Orjo-nikidze’s “manhandling”.
I think that no provocation or even insult can justify such Russian manhandling and thatComrade Dzerzhinsky was inexcusably guilty in adopting a light-hearted attitude towards it.
For all the citizens in the Caucasus Orjonikidze was the authority.
Orjonikidze had no right to display that irritability to which he and Dzerzhinsky referred.
On the contrary, Orjonikidze should have behaved with a restraint which cannot be demanded of any ordinary citizen, still less of a man accused of a “political” crime.
And, to tell the truth, those nationalist-socialists were citizens who were accused of a political crime, and the terms of the ac-cusation were such that it could not be described otherwise.
Here we have an important question of principle: how is internationalism to be understood? * Lenin December 30, 1922 Taken down by M.

December 31, 1922 THE QUESTION OF NATIONALITIES OR “AUTONOMISATION” (Continued) In my writings on the national question I have already said that an abstract presentation of the question of nation-alism in general is of no use at all.
A distinction must neces-sarily be made between the nationalism of an oppressor nation and that of an oppressed nation, the nationalism of a big nation and that of a small nation.
In respect of the second kind of nationalism we, nation-als of a big nation, have nearly always been guilty, in his-toric practice, of an infinite number of cases of violence; furthermore, we commit violence and insult an infinite * After this the following phrase was crossed out in the shorthand text: “It seems to me that our comrades have not studied this important question of principle sufficiently.
”—Ed.
number of times without noticing it.
It is sufficient to recall my Volga reminiscences of how non-Russians are treated; how the Poles are not called by any other name than Polyachishka, how the Tatar is nicknamed Prince, how the Ukrainians are always Khokhols and the Georgi-ans and other Caucasian nationals always Kapkasians.
That is why internationalism on the part of oppressors or “great” nations, as they are called (though they are great only in their violence, only great as bullies), must consist not only in the observance of the formal equality of nations but even in an inequality of the oppressor na-tion, the great nation, that must make up for the inequal-ity which obtains in actual practice.
Anybody who does not understand this has not grasped the real proletarian attitude to the national question, he is still essentially petty bourgeois in his point of view and is, therefore, sure to descend to the bourgeois point of view.
What is important for the proletarian? For the proletarian it is not only important, it is absolutely essential that he should be assured that the non-Russians place the greatest possible trust in the proletarian class struggle.
What is needed to ensure this? Not merely formal equality.
In one way or another, by one’s attitude or by concessions, it is necessary to compensate the non-Russians for the lack of trust, for the suspicious and the insults to which the gov-ernment of the “dominant” nation subjected them in the past.
I think it is unnecessary to explain this to Bolsheviks, to Communists, in greater detail.
And I think that in the present instance, as far as the Georgian nation is concerned, we have a typical case in which a genuinely proletar-ian attitude makes profound caution, thoughtfulness and a readiness to compromise a matter of necessity for us.
The Georgian who is neglectful of this aspect of the ques-tion, or who carelessly flings about accusations of “national-ist-socialism” (whereas he himself is a real and true “na-tionalist-socialist”, and even a vulgar Great-Russian bully), violates, in substance, the interests of proletarian class solidarity, for nothing holds up the development and strength-ening of proletarian class solidarity so much as national injustice; “offended” nationals are not sensitive to anythingso much as to the feeling of equality and the violation of this equality, if only through negligence or jest—to the violation of that equality by their proletarian comrades.
That is why in this case it is better to overdo rather than underdo the concessions and leniency towards the national minorities.
That is why, in this case, the fundamental interest of proletarian solidarity, and consequently of the proletarian class struggle, requires that we never adopt a formal attitude to the national question, but always take into account the specific attitude of the proletarian of the oppressed (or small) nation towards the oppressor (or great) nation.

December 31, 1922 Continuation of the notes.
December 31, 1922 What practical measures must be taken in the present situation? Firstly, we must maintain and strengthen the union of socialist republics.
Of this there can be no doubt.
This measure is necessary for us and it is necessary for the world communist proletariat in its struggle against the world bourgeoisie and its defence against bourgeois intrigues.
Secondly, the union of socialist republics must be re-tained for its diplomatic apparatus.
By the way, this ap-paratus is an exceptional component of our state apparatus.
We have not allowed a single influential person from the old tsarist apparatus into it.
All sections with any author-ity are composed of Communists.
That is why it has already won for itself (this may be said boldly) the name of a re-liable communist apparatus purged to an incomparably greater extent of the old tsarist, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements than that which we have had to make do with in other People’s Commissariats.
Thirdly, exemplary punishment must be inflicted on Comrade Orjonikidze (I say this all the more regretfully as I am one of his personal friends and have worked with him abroad) and the investigation of all the material which Dzerzhinsky’s commission has collected must be completed or started over again to correct the enormous mass of wrongs and biased judgements which it doubtlessly contains.
The political responsibility for all this truly Great-Russian nationalist campaign must, of course, be laid on Stalin and Dzerzhinsky.
Fourthly, the strictest rules must be introduced on the use of the national language in the non-Russian republics of our union, and these rules must be checked with special care.
There is no doubt that our apparatus being what it is, there is bound to be, on the pretext of unity in the railway ser-vice, unity in the fiscal service and so on, a mass of truly Russian abuses.
Special ingenuity is necessary for the struggle against these abuses, not to mention special sin-cerity on the part of those who undertake this struggle.
A detailed code will be required, and only the nationals living in the republic in question can draw it up at all successfully.
And then we cannot be sure in advance that as a result of this work we shall not take a step backward at our next Congress of Soviets, i.
e.
, retain the union of Soviet socialist republics only for military and diplomatic affairs, and in all other respects restore full independence to the individual People’s Commissariats.
It must be borne in mind that the decentralisation of the People’s Commissariats and the lack of co-ordination in their work as far as Moscow and other centres are con-cerned can be compensated sufficiently by Party authority, if it is exercised with sufficient prudence and impartiality; the harm that can result to our state from a lack of uni-fication between the national apparatuses and the Russian apparatus is infinitely less than that which will be done not only to us, but to the whole International, and to the hundreds of millions of the peoples of Asia, which is destined to follow us on to the stage of history in the near future.
It would be unpardonable opportunism if, on the eve of the debut of the East, just as it is awakening, we undermined our prestige with its peoples, even if only bythe slightest crudity or injustice towards our own non-Russian nationalities.
The need to rally against the imperial-ists of the West, who are defending the capitalist world, is one thing.
There can be no doubt about that and it would be superfluous for me to speak about my unconditional approval of it.
It is another thing when we ourselves lapse, even if only in trifles, into imperialist attitudes towards oppressed nationalities, thus undermining all our principled sincerity, all our principled defence of the struggle against imperialism.
But the morrow of world history will be a day when the awakening peoples oppressed by imperialism are finally aroused and the decisive long and hard struggle for their liberation begins.

The final break and the group’s withdrawal from the Union took place at the Union’s second congress in April 1900; the Emancipation of Labour group and its followers walked out of the congress and set up an independent organisation, Sotsial-Demokrat.

It was drawn up by Lenin in late March and early April 1900 (see present edition, Vol.

The draft was rewritten by Lenin when he arrived abroad, after the August 1900 conference with members of the Emancipation of Labour group (G.
V.
Plekhanov, P.
B.
Axel-rod, and V.

In the first half of October, the declara-tion was published as a leaflet (ibid.

34In contrast to the original draft, which set forth a programme for the two organs—newspaper and journal—the declaration is-sued by the Iskra editors concerned only the newspaper, it having been decided that the tasks of the journal Zarya would be dealt with separately, in its first issue.
For reasons of secrecy it was decided not to circulate the declaration abroad until it reached Russia.

It described the first mass demonstration by Kharkov workers on May Day in 1900.
It appeared abroad with a preface by Lenin (see present p.

4, pp.
357-65).
22Axelrod’s advice in his letter to Lenin of October 15, 1900, dealt with the editing of letters from Russia for Iskra.
His idea was to make use of some letters together with other material for do-mestic reviews or editorials (see Lenin Miscellany III, p.
66).

Petersburg group—the Rabocheye Znamya group emerged in the second half of 1897.
It took a negative attitude to Econo-mism.
It set itself the aim of conducting political propaganda among the workers and published the newspaper Rabocheye Zna-mya (Workers’ Banner), of which three issues appeared.
It also published several pamphlets and proclamations.
Among its lead-ers were S.

In January 1901, the St.

Most of the members of the St.

Petersburg Workers’ Organisation—an Economist organisa-tion set up in the summer of 1900.
Its appeal “To the Workers of All Factories”, published in its newspaper Rabochaya Mysl (Workers’ Thought) No.
9, September 1900, called on the workers to organise circles for the working out of a programme of struggle and for mutual assistance.
In the autumn of 1900, the Workers’ Organisation merged with the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class.
The programme and charter of this united organisation were carried in Rabochaya Mysl No.
11 in April 1901.
Following the victory of the Iskra trend within the St.
Peters-burg Committee and its recognition of the newspaper Iskra and the journal Zarya as the leading Social-Democratic organs, a section of the St.
Petersburg organisation under the influence and leadership of the proponents of Economism split off from the St.
Petersburg Committee in September 1902 and once again formed a separate organisation called the Committee for Workers’Organisation, which rejoined the Party organisation after the Second Congress of the Party in early 1904.

The group’s publications distorted Marxist theory, rejected Iskra’s revolutionary tactics and took a hostile attitude to Lenin’s organisational principles of party building.
In view of these departures from Social-Democratic views and tactics, its splitting activities and lack of contact with Social-Democratic organisations in Russia, the group was not allowed to attend the Second Congress of the R.

34During preparations for the publication of Iskra, differences on the place of publication arose between Lenin and A.
N.
Po-tresov, on the one hand, and G.
V.
Plekhanov and P.
B.
Axelrod, on the other.
The latter opposed Iskra’s publication in Germany and wanted to have it issued in Switzerland, under their immediate direction.
Lenin and Potresov opposed this.
Following the confer-ence in Corsier (near Geneva) m August 1900 with members of the Emancipation of Labour group, Lenin and Potresov decided that in the interest of the cause Iskra and Zarya should be published in Germany.
The essence of these differences of principle was described by Lenin in “How the ‘Spark’ Was Nearly Extinguished” (see present edition, Vol.
4, pp.
333-49).
Lenin and Potresov won out and the publication of Iskra was started in Germany, initially in Leipzig and then in Munich.
Zarya was published legally in Stuttgart.

Weidel, a Swedish worker who settled in Finland for that purpose.
But Garder’s arrest in 1900 disrupted the arrangement and the route via Finland.
A route running from Stockholm to Abo and across the Russian frontier was restarted in 1901.

On April 5, 1901, Russian students in Geneva staged a demonstration in front of the Rus-sian Consulate in protest against the harassment of political émigrés.
The Russian Government took the occasion to exercise pressure on the Swiss authorities to secure the deportation of prominent political expatriates, chiefly Plekhanov, from Switzer-land.
However, Plekhanov was able to prove that he had noth-ing to do with the demonstration.
Members of Iskra’s Editorial Board had feared an unfavourable outcome.

78 80Lenin is replying to Plekhanov on the question of Iskra’s tactics and slogans for marking May 1, 1901 in Russia as set forth in May Day Listok “Iskry”.
In a letter to the Munich section of Iskra’s Editorial Board on April 19, Plekhanov wrote that the workers in Russia should not be urged to demonstrate during the May Day celebrations, because the government would jump at the occasion to shed blood and the workers would be defeated.
Plekhanov believed that the main task at the time was to build up local Social-Democratic organisations.
The letter shows that in the concrete historical situation Lenin was in agreement with Plekhanov.

78 first as a monthly, then as a bi-monthly.
82The bulletins were to be published by the Iskra promotion group in Berlin, but were not because of a shortage of money and material.
The Neutral Group of Social-Democrats in Berlin was formed round V.
A.
Bazarov in the autumn of 1900 and set itself the task of healing the split between the supporters of Rabocheye Dyelo and the Emancipation of Labour group after the Second Congress of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad.
Among its members were also M.
G.
Vecheslov and I.
B.
Basovsky.
Accord-ing to Bazarov, the group sent its representatives to Geneva in early 1900 to persuade the Iskra and the Sotsial-Demokrat organi-sations to be reconciled with the Union.
The group issued three or four political proclamations and was disbanded in the summer of 1901.
p.
79 83Beginning with issue No.
4 in May 1901, Iskra appeared periodi-cally, once or twice a month.
p.
79 84The Sotsialist group was organised in St.
Petersburg in the sum-mer of 1900; its members were dissatisfied with the Economist trend of the St.
Petersburg League of Struggle.
The group laid emphasis on political struggle.
In January 1901, it merged with the Rabocheye Znamya (Workers’ Banner) group, but after the arrests in the spring of 1901 the group broke up.
p.
81 85Two May Day leaflets were issued in 1901: in April, Listok “Iskry” (Iskra’s leaflet) signed by the Iskra organisation, and the all-Party leaflet, Pervoye Maya (The First of May), adopted at a conference of several Southern committees at the beginning of February.
A comparison of the two shows that the latter pursuedthe general aims of spreading socialist ideas among the masses, whereas the former put forward slogans of political struggle against the autocracy, in response to the broad student movement which had been revolutionised by workers’ participation.

It was attended by the representatives of Iskra, Zarya, the Borba and the Rabocheye Dyelo groups, the Union of Russian Social-Democrats Abroad, the Bund and the revolutionary Sotsial-Demokrat organisation.
It was preliminary, and the final decisions were put off until the “Unity” Conference in October 1901, at which the Rabocheye Dyelo and the Iskra groups formally split up.

On the first item of the agenda, “Agreement in Principle and Instructions to Editorial Boards”, Lenin, who attended the Congress under the name of Frey, delivered an eloquent speech, exposing the Union’s opportunist activity.
This was Lenin’s first public speech before Russian Social-Democrats abroad.
When the opportunist amendments and addenda to the June resolution, adopted by the Third Congress of the Union of Russian Social-Democrats, were announced at the Congress, the revolutionary section of the Congress (members of the Iskra and Zarya and the Sotsial-Demokrat organisations) read out a statement saying that unity was impossible and left the Congress.
On Lenin’s initiative, these organisations in October 1901 united into the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad.

109 129A reference to the re-establishment of the Organising Committee for convening the Party’s Second Congress, as the first committee, elected at the Belostok conference, had nearly all been arrested.
N.

We are sending him to you, and the two of you will have to make preparations for the Congress.
But you must be diplomatic with him and not show your hand” (see Lenin Miscellany VIII, p.
238).
In this way Lengnik was to be co-opted to the Organising Committee.
A month later, Lenin wrote about it to I.

21, June 1, 1902, in the “From Our Social Life” section, and dealt with the attempt on the life of the Vilna Governor von Wal by the worker G.
D.
Lek-kert (Lekukha).
Lenin and Iskra had repeatedly exposed the harmful effect of individual acts of terrorism on the mass work-ers’ movement, and in the event censured Martov and Zasulich who approved of Lekkert’s act.
Further on, there is a reference to G.
V.
Plekhanov’s article on Lekkert’s act, which was to be published in Iskra’s next issue.
Plekhanov accepted Lenin’s proposal and wrote an editorial forIskra No.
22, entitled “The Russian Working Class and the Police Whipping”.
p.
115 133Lenin’s letter makes it clear that L.
D.

issued a leaflet, “Two Centuries of a Press in Bondage”, on January 3, 1903, branding Russia’s disgraceful censorship, and describing the struggle for freedom of the press (from Radishchev to Herzen).
It also noted the wide spread of illegal revolutionary publications in late 19th and early 20th centuries, and called for a struggle against the tsarist govern-ment.
p.
127 148A reference to the meeting of all six members of the former Iskra Editorial Board and F.
V.
Lengnik, a member of the Central Committee, on the question of agreement.
Lenin and Plekhanov tried to co-opt Y.
O.
Martov to the editorial board and get other former Menshevik editors and contributors to Iskra to work on it, but they failed because the Mensheviks demanded the co-optation of all four former editors.
Lenin saw the “absurdity” of the demandand abandoned the idea of negotiations.
However, on October 4, 1903, Plekhanov made another effort to co-opt two editors but this was also rejected.
For details on the October 4 meeting and the subsequent correspondence, see present edition, p.
128 Vol.
7, pp.
349-57.
149A reference to the “personal conflict” between Lenin and Martov at the League’s Second Congress, which amounted to the follow-ing: Martov accused Lenin that in his report at the Congress he had portrayed Martov as a liar and intriguer in presenting the question of organising the C.
O.
Editorial Board at the Party’s Second Congress.
Accordingly, he challenged Lenin to appear before a court of arbitration.
Lenin protested against such tac-tics, took up Martov’s challenge and, in his turn, challenged him to appear before a court of arbitration on the issue.
The conflict was ironed out through the mediation of G.
M.
Krzhizhanovsky during his stay abroad in the latter half of November 1903, by means of an exchange of notes between Lenin and Martov.
The Editorial Board failed to meet Lenin’s wish that the two notes should be published in an annex to the minutes of the League’s Congress (see Letter to F.
I.
Dan of December 2, 1903).
The fact that the “personal conflict had been ironed out” was certified only in an editorial footnote to the relevant section of the minutes.
It said: “The question of a court of arbi-tration has been eliminated through an exchange of explanations between Comrades Lenin and Martov which took place after the League Congress (Minutes of the Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad, p.
66).
The notes were later published in the Commentary to the Minutes of the Second Congress of the League of Russian Revolutionary Social-Democracy Abroad, Geneva, 1904.

In addition, the police arrested .
.

many others.
” Lenin set forth the essence of the conflict in the Nikolayev Committee during the discussion of the question at the Party Council’s meeting on June 18, 1904 (see present edi-tion, Vol.
7, pp.
440-41).
The names of the persons indicated in Lenin’s letter by their initials, or the group of agitators, mentioned at the end of the letter, have not been identified.
p.
131 151During the stay of Lenin and N.
K.
Krupskaya in the mountains in July and August 1904 and the trip of V.
A.
Noskov (a member of the Central Committee’s Section Abroad) to Russia, the sec-tion was in the charge of V.
D.
Bonch-Bruyevich, M.
N.
Lyadov and P.
N.
Lepeshinsky, the Central Committee’s agents abroad.
Bonch-Bruyevich was in charge of the C.
C.
’s forwarding office; Lyadov was the treasurer, and Lepeshinsky, the deputy C.
C.
representative abroad on connections with Iskra’s Editorial Board.
The agents consulted Lenin on all important questions and transmitted to him all the correspondence coming from Russia.
p.
133 152A reference to the official written authorisation that was to have been issued by the C.
C.
representatives abroad (Lenin and V.
A.
Noskov) to the collegium of C.
C.
agents abroad in Geneva, to conduct the business of the C.
C.
’s Section Abroad in the absence of the C.
C.
members.
V.

Bonch-Bruyevich informed Lenin of a fresh conflict with Iskra’s Editorial Board, who had refused to deal with the C.
C.

p.
133 153A Party library in Geneva was organised by the C.
C.

The 300 francs mentioned by Lenin had been borrowed by the library from the Party treasury and soon repaid.
p.
133 154A reference to the open letter of 37 Bolsheviks (the Geneva group) to Plekhanov on his reply to the open letter of M.
N.
Lyadov, which the latter addressed to Plekhanov on June 1, 1904 in Iskra No.
67, concerning his article in Iskra No.
66 (May 15, 1904), “Silence Is No Longer Possible!”.
Plekhanov sharply criticised the activity of the C.
C.
’s repre-sentatives abroad and invited C.
C.
members to repudiate Lenin and his pamphlet One Step Forward, Two Steps Back.
Lyadov demanded that Plekhanov make public facts and documents confirming his assessment of this activity, and also state the real grounds for his demand that C.
C.
members repudiate Lenin.
Ple-khanov replied to Lyadov in the same issue of Iskra in a rude man-ner, but said nothing on the substance of Lyadov’s charges.
This prompted the group of Bolsheviks abroad to issue their open let-ter, which stated that Plekhanov had declined to provide factual confirmation of his charges against the C.
C.
and its representatives abroad, and censured him for his behaviour in this case and to-wards the majority of the Second Congress of the R.

D.
Bonch-Bruyevich concerning the start of publication of Bolshevik Social-Democratic literature with a letter from Glebov (V.
A.
Noskov) refusing to print this statement in the Party printing shop; and3) a pamphlet by Galyorka, Down with Bonapartism! (Bonch-Bruye-vich’s statement was printed on the last sheet of the pamphlet, Our Misunderstandings, of the Geneva edition of 1904).
p.
135 158Lenin and “Ilya” (I.

p.
135 159The “agreement” on a joint solidarity statement abroad on be-half of the Central Committee was concluded between Lenin and V.
A.
Noskov, who came abroad as the C.
C.
representative abroad and a second member of the Party Council.
(He replaced F.
V.
Len-gnik, who returned to Russia.
) The “agreement” was signed on May 26 with the participation of M.
M.
Essen, a third member of the C.
C.

135 Vol.
7, pp.
430-31 and 426-29).
160A reference to Lenin’s letter to five members of the Central Com-mittee in Russia with his motivated protest against the C.
C.
’s “July Declaration” (see present edition, Vol.
7, pp.
462-63).
July Declaration of the Central Committee—a resolution adopt-ed by the conciliatory members of the C.
C.
, L.
B.
Krasin, V.
A.
Noskov and L.
Y.
Galperin, in July 1904.
It consisted of 26 points, nine of which were published in Iskra No.
72 of August 25, 1904, under the title “Declaration of the Central Committee”.
It was adopted without the knowledge of two C.
C.
members, Lenin, who was in Switzerland, and Rozalia Zemlyachka, which deprived them of the opportunity of standing up for the views of the Party’s majority in the C.
C.
The declaration recog-nised the Menshevik Editorial Board of Iskra, co-opted by Ple-khanov, and co-opted another three conciliatory members of the C.
C.
, namely, A.
I.
Lyubimov, L.
Y.
Karpov and I.
F.
Dubro-vinsky.
The conciliators came out against the convocation of the Party’s Third Congress and dissolved the C.
C.
Southern Bureau, which had been campaigning for the Congress.
They revoked Lenin’s powers as C.
C.
representative abroad and prohibited the publi-cation of his works without the permission of the C.
C.
collegium.
The adoption of the July Declaration signified a total betrayal of the decisions of the Party’s Second Congress by the conciliato-ry members of the C.
C.
and their open backing of the Mensheviks.
Lenin was supported by the Party’s local committees—St.
Petersburg, Moscow, Riga, Baku, Tiflis, Imeretian-Mingrelian, Nikolayev, Odessa and Yekaterinoslav—which resolutely condemned the July Declaration.

p.
137 167The addressee has not been ascertained.
168The notification issued by the Bureau of Majority Committees on the convocation of the Party’s Third Congress contained a clause, in the section dealing with organisational questions for decision at the Congress, on re-organising the centres.
It said: “There is to be only one centre, and that in Russia” (see KPSS v resolyutsiyakh i resheniyakh syezdov, konferentsy i plenumov TsK [The C.
P.
S.
U.
in the Resolutions and Decisions of Congresses, Con-ferences and C.
C.
Plenary Meetings], Part One, 1954, p.
72).
Lenin expressed his attitude to this clause in the document “Modifica-tion of the Clause in the Rules Concerning the Centres” (see present edition, Vol.
8, pp.
197-99), proposing the retention of two cen-tres, one abroad, the C.
O.
Editorial Board, and one in Russia, the Central Committee, whose periodical meetings “actually will always play the role of supreme or highest ‘Council’ of the Party” (ibid.
, p.
199).
p.
142 169“From the Editors” was written by Lenin and published in Vperyod (Forward) No.

In the present edition, it is entitled “The Convening of the Third Party Congress” (see p.
142 Vol.

177-80).
170Vperyod No.
8, of February 28 (15), 1905, carried the following statement in the “From the Party” section, drawn up by M.
S.
Ol-minsky: From the Editors: We have just received information that can be interpreted as the C.
C.
’s consent to a congress right away.
Without in any way vouching for its authenticity for the time being, we do consider it plausible.
The C.
C.
has been oppos-ing a congress for many months, dissolving organisations and boycotting and disorganising committees favouring a congress.
p.
142These tactics have failed.
Now, being guided by its rule of ‘ex-pediency is all, formality, nothing’, the C.
C.
is prepared, for the sake of ‘expediency’ (that is, prevention of a congress), to declare formally a hundred times, if need be, that it wants a congress con-vened at once.
” Lenin added the following: “We hope that neither the Bureau nor the local committees will let themselves be duped by the trickery of the Party ‘Shidlovsky Commission’.
The same attitude to the C.
C.
’s consent was expressed by Lenin in his letter to S.
I.
Gusev on February 25, 1905 (see present edition, Vol.

143 172Lenin’s letter to the secretary of the Labour Representation Com-mittee in Britain was written in the following circumstances.
In 1904, in connection with the strikes in Russia, Russian Social-Democratic organisations in London set up a committee in aid of the Russian strikers, which sent out an appeal for aid to British trade unions.
It was also decided to appeal to the Labour Represen-tation Committee, of which James Ramsay MacDonald was secretary.
The negotiations with the Committee were assigned to K.
M.
Takhta-rev and N.
A.
Alexeyev (who were members of the Russian Social-Democratic organisation in London before its split).
The Labour Representation Committee responded to the appeal, stipulating that a part of the money should go in aid of the widows and orphans of the numerous victims of the fusillade of January 9 (22), 1905.
p.
144 173A reference to the opening of the Third Party Congress.
Lenin wrote to P.

However, the Congress opened only on April 25.
C.
C.
members who were on the Organis-ing Committee for the convocation of the Congress made a final effort to reach agreement with the Party Council (Plekhanov, Axelrod and Martov), to have them recognise the C.

Both commit-tees appointed representatives to a commission, called “United Organisation of Social-Democrats of the Town of Nikolayev”, with the task of working out a plan for joint action and agitation connected with it.
To ensure the preparations for the action, the commission set up a technical group, a funds commission, and a combat group.
A report from Nikolayev on this agreement was published in the “From the Party” section of Proletary No.

p.
152 185Cadets—Constitutional-Democratic Party, the leading party of the liberal-monarchist bourgeoisie in Russia, which was founded in 1905.
They advocated a constitutional monarchy.
During the first Russian revolution of 1905-07, they styled themselves the party of “people’s freedom”, while actually betraying the people’s interests and holding secret talks with the tsarist government on how to crush the revolution.
As the Opposition Party in the Du-ma, they strove to share power with the tsarist government and supported it on all major issues of domestic and foreign policy.
During the First World War, Cadet leaders, among them Mi-lyukov, were the chief proponents of the annexationist policy of Russian imperialism.
After the February revolution of 1917, they entered the bourgeois Provisional Government and fought the revolutionary movement of workers and peasants; they stood up for the landed estates and wanted to force the people to con-tinue the imperialist war.
After the victory of the October Social-ist Revolution, the Cadets took part in the counter-revolutionary armed struggle against Soviet Russia.
p.
154 186The conference of Social-Democratic organisations in Russia to which Lenin refers was held in Riga on September 7-9 (20-22), 1905.
It was called by the C.

It was attended by representatives of the C.
C.
, the O.
C.
of the Mensheviks, the Bund, the Lettish Social-Democrats, the Social-Democrats of Poland and Lithua-nia, and the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party.
Over Menshevik protests, the conference passed a resolution on active boycott of the Bulygin Duma.
The conference decisions were published in Proletary No.
22 on October 24 (11), 1905 (see KPSS v resolyu-tsiyakh.

p.
155 190In 1907, M.
S.
Kedrov’s Zerno Book Publishers in St.
Pe-tersburg started publication of a three-volume collection of Lenin’s works under the title “Twelve Years”.
However, they managed to issue only the first volume and a part of the second, because of intensified harassment and strict censorship under Stolypin.
p.
156 191After his return from the Party’s London Congress, Lenin lived in Finland, near St.
Petersburg.
In view of the arrests that had started, the Bolshevik Centre decided to transfer the publication of Proletary from Finland to some foreign country.
Accordingly, Lenin, together with A.
A.
Bogdanov and I.
F.
Dubrovinsky, was instructed to go to Switzerland.
Lenin left Finland in Decem-ber 1907, spent a few days in Stockholm waiting for N.
K.

p.
157 192A reference to the Proletary printing shop and its forwarding section.
p.
157 193The arrests in Berlin were connected with the changing of money expropriated in Tiflis on June 13, 1907.
The organiser of the ex-propriation, Kamo (Ter-Petrosyan), and all its participants man-aged to escape.
But the tsarist government informed the police abroad of the serial numbers of the 500-ruble banknotes seized in the expropriation; in December 1907, persons changing these banknotes were simultaneously arrested in Berlin, Munich, Paris, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Geneva.
In November 1907, Kamo was betrayed by the provocateur Y.
A.
Zhitomirsky and arrested in Berlin.
The Russian Government, having established Kamo’s identity, secured his extradition as a criminal.
During the search for the Tiflis expropriators, arrests were carried out in the Rus-sian Social-Democratic colonies in Paris, Munich, Geneva and Stockholm.

158 195Trudoviks—petty-bourgeois democrats in the Dumas, mainly peasants and intellectuals of the Narodnik stripe.
Their group was organised in April 1906 by the peasant deputies of the FirstDuma, who wavered between the Cadets and the Social-Democrats.
During the First World War most of the Trudoviks took a p.
158 social-chauvinist stand.

Lenin sent Bogdanov Steklov’s letter with his own note.
The collection was not published.
p.
164 200Octobrists—a counter-revolutionary party of big industrialists and landowners formed soon after the tsar’s Manifesto of October 17, 1905 (whence their name).
In it, the tsar, terrified by the revolution, promised “civil liberties” and a constitution.
The Octobrists fully supported the government’s domestic and foreign policies.
p.
165 201On August 4, 1909, a general strike broke out in Sweden in re-sponse to the lockout of 83,000 workers in various industriesannounced by the federation of industrialists on August 2.

167 205Liquidationism—an opportunist trend dominant among the Men-sheviks after the defeat of the first Russian revolution (1905-07).
Its supporters demanded the liquidation of the proletariat’s illegal revolutionary party and the establishment in its stead of an opportunist party engaged only in activity permitted by the tsarist government.
Lenin and other Bolsheviks tirelessly exposed the liquidators, who had betrayed the cause of the revolution.

p.
171 207A reference to the convocation of the Russian section (collegium) of the C.

and co-optation of new members.
The latter became necessary because of the arrest of a number of C.

members elect-ed at the London Congress in 1907.
The liquidators, who took a negative attitude to the resumption of C.
C.
activity in Russia, strongly opposed the meeting of the remaining C.
C.
members and co-optation of new ones.
Their formal refusal to take part in the effort to restore the C.
C.
served as the immediate cause for the cancel-lation of the agreement concluded at the C.

Soon after the Jan-uary Plenum of the C.
C.
in 1910, the liquidators obtained a majority in the Bureau, and it became the rallying point of anti-Party forces.
The Bureau’s liquidationist tactics forced the Bolsheviks torecall their representative (Alexandrov—N.

Semashko) in May 1911.
Later the representatives of the Polish and Lettish Social-Democrats were also recalled.
The Bureau dissolved itself in January 1912.
p.
180 219The Organising Commission Abroad and the Technical Commission Abroad were formed in June 1911 at a meeting of Central Com-mittee members to prepare for the Prague Party conference.

p.
180 221Otzovism (from otzyvat—recall)—an opportunist trend which emerged among the Bolsheviks in 1908.
Behind the otzovists’ rev-olutionary slogans was the demand for a recall of the Social-Democratic deputies from the Duma and an end to activity in legal organisations.
They declared that in the conditions of reaction, the Party should conduct illegal activities only, and refused to take part in the Duma, trade unions, co-operatives and other legal and semi-legal mass organisations.
For details on the otzovists, see Lenin’s article “The Faction of Supporters of Otzovism and p.

222Vperyod group—an anti-Party group consisting of otzovists, ulti-matumists, god-builders and empirio-monists (proponents of the reactionary idealist philosophy of Mach and Avenarius); the group was organised in December 1909, on the initiative of A.
Bogdanov and G.
Alexinsky, and included A.
V.
Lunacharsky, M.

Lyadov, M.
N.
Pokrovsky and A.

Sokolov.
They published the magazine Vperyod (Forward).
In 1912, they united with the Menshevik-liquidators into an anti-Party bloc (August bloc), which was organised by Trotsky.
The group failed to find support among the workers and broke up in 1913.
It was finally disbanded after the February revolution in 1917.

222 256General Association of German Workers—a political organisation of the German workers set up at a congress of workers societies in Leipzig in 1863, with the active participation of Ferdinand Lassalle.
The fact that it was set up was of positive sig-nificance for the working-class movement, but Lassalle, who was elected President, took it along an opportunist path.
It confined its aims to working for a general franchise and non-violent parliamentary activity.
Engels said that “’universal, equal and direct suffrage’ was propounded by Lassalle as the only and infallible means of winning political power by the working class” (Marx/Engels, Werke, Band 16, Dietz Verlag, Berlin, 1962, S.
327).
Its leadership demanded the establishment of workers’ producer associations subsidised by the state which would alleg-edly transform the Prussian state into a “free state of the people”; they regarded the peasantry as a reactionary mass.
The Lassalle-ans approved of the counter-revolutionary way of unifying Ger-many “from the top”, through dynastic wars waged by Prussia.
It broke up in 1875.

It assured thereactionary bloc of landowners and big capitalists of complete domination of the Third and Fourth Dumas.

However, the protest was not supported by the Congress and following the debate it adopted Dontsov’s resolution setting forth the programme of the Ukrainian separatists.

The Commission was set up in Paris in early September 1913 on the initiative of the bureau of the sections abroad of the Social-Democratic Party of Poland and Lithuania (Rozlamists).
The Commission worked for five months and arrived at the conclusion that there was no ground for the party trial of Radek and his dismissal from the party.
Lenin sided with the opposition (Rozlamists) and believed that the charges sprang from the acute struggle which the Chief Executive waged against the opposition, and were motivat-ed by factional considerations.
He supported the review of the Radek case.

Lenin was arrested the next day.
After a fortnight’s detention, he was released through the efforts of Russian and Polish Social-Demo-crats and with the help of Austrian socialists Viktor Adler and deputy of the Austrian Parliament Hermann Diamant.
He was allowed to leave Austria for Switzerland.

294 325Italo-Swiss Socialist Conference, in whose preparation Lenin took part, was held at Lugano on September 27, 1914.
Lenin’s theses on the war were discussed at the conference and were partially included in the resolution.
The conference was attended by R.
Grimm, Paul Pflüger and others from Switzerland, and Ser-rati, Lazzari, Morgari, Turati, Modigliani and others from Italy.
The resolution of the conference characterised the war as impe-rialist and called on the proletariat to wage an international struggle for peace.
While the decisions of the conference were not consistently internationalist or thoroughly revolutionary, they were, nevertheless, a step forward in the preparation for restoring international proletarian ties.

331On September 27, 1914, the central organ of the German Social-Democrats Vorwärts, carried an article, “Germany and Foreign Countries” which timidly suggested that the German and French proletariat were involved in the war against their will.
On this pretext the paper was banned by the Commander of the Bran-denburg district, General von Kessel.
Haase and Fischer request-ed that the bail be lifted.
Kessel agreed, provided Vorwärts re-frained from dealing “with the subject of class hatred and the class struggle”.
The editors accepted the condition, and the paper re-appeared on October 1, frontpaging General Kessel’s order on the resumption of its publication.

Early in the First World War (1914-18), Golos carried Martov’s articles against the social-chauvinists.
That was when Lenin approved of the paper’s activity.
Following Martov’s turn to the right, the paper began to defend the social-chauvinists, prefer-ring “unity with the social-chauvinists to drawing closer to those who are irreconcilably hostile to social-chauvinism” (see present edition, Vol.
21, p.

All the participants in the conference were arrested, except for the deputies, because of their parliamentary immunity.

Lenin analysed the results of the trial in his article “What Has Been Revealed by the Trial of the Russian Social-Democratic Labour Duma Group”, which was published in Sotsial-Demokrat No.

In “Die Sozialdemokratie im Kriege” he wrote that “if it comes to war, every nation has to defend itself as best it can.
It follows that Social-Democrats of all nations have an equal right or an equal duty to take part in this defence; none should hurl reproaches at another.

Lyakhotsky’s type-setting shop was the only one in Switzerland which had Russian type, and so catered forvarious organisations.
The setting of Sotsial-Demokrat became extremely difficult in early 1915, when Borotba, a newspaper of the Ukrainian nationalists, was also composed there.
Kuzma and Kuzmikha (his wife), who had great influence on her husband, sympathised with Borotba.
The problem was being con-stantly discussed and this is reflected in Lenin’s and N.

Krup-skaya’s letters to V.

Karpinsky and others.
In early 1915 Russian type was found in Benteli’s printing shop in Bumplitz (near Berne) and a number of issues of Sotsial-Demokrat and other material were printed there.

Groups Abroad in Berne between February 27 and March 4, 1915, convened on Lenin’s initiative.
It had the significance of an all-Party confer-ence because it was impossible to call a congress or an all-Russia conference during the war.
The main item on its agenda was the question of war and the Party’s tasks.
Lenin gave the report.
Lenin also wrote all the main resolutions and the introduction to them.
They appeared in Sotsial-Demokrat and also as a sup-plement to the pamphlet Socialism and War, which was published in Russian and German.
The resolutions of the Berne Conference were also published in leaflet form in French and circulated among the delegates to the Zimmerwald Socialist Conference and mailed to Left-wing Social-Democrats in other countries.

382Instead of a second preliminary meeting at Zimmerwald the conference proper was held there from September 5 to 8, 1915.
It was the scene of a struggle between revolutionary international-ists led by Lenin, and the Kautskyite majority.
Lenin organised his supporters into the Zimmerwald Left, a group in which the Bolshevik Party was alone in consistently following a correct and internationalist line against the war.
The conference adopted a manifesto, which declared the war to be imperialist, condemned the behaviour of the “socialists” who voted for the war credits and took part in bourgeois govern-ments, and called on the workers of Europe to campaign against the war, for a peace without indemnities and annexations.
The conference also adopted a resolution expressing sympathy with the victims of war and elected an International Socialist Commission (I.

Only one (double) issue appeared.
It carried Lenin’s articles “The Collapse of the Second International”, “The Voice of an Honest French Socialist”, and “Imperialism and Socialism in Italy”.
Lenin expected to turn the magazine into an organ of the Left-wing Social-Democrats, but serious differences soon developed between the Sotsial-Demokrat Editorial Board and Bukharin, Pyatakov and Bosch, which were aggravated after the appearance of the first issue.

356question should be decided on the strength of each country’s strategic position).
The statement was quoted in Sotsial-Demokrat No.
47, October 13, 1915 (“Two Statements at the International Conference”).
p.
358 419A reference to Sotsial-Demokrat No.
47, which was issued on October 13 (two days after the double issue, No.
45-46) and which dealt almost entirely with the state of Social-Democratic work in Petrograd and Moscow.
It also carried Lenin’s “Several Theses Proposed by the Editors”, dealing with topical issues of Social-Democratic work in Russia (see present edition, Vol.
21, pp.
401-04).
The gist of Karpinsky’s reply is not known but it appears to be negative, because Sotsial-Demokrat No.
47 was not printed by Kuzma, but by Benteli in Bumplitz.
p.
359 420This may be a reference to Internationale Flugblätter No.
1, issued in November 1915, and carrying F.
Platten’s Zurich address.
On the strength of this, Lenin’s letter in the Fourth Edition of his Sobraniya Sochineny (Collected Works) is dated “late November-early December 1915 ” .
But it is also possible that Lenin was referring to the leaflet Gegen die Lüge der Vaterlandsverteidigung (Against the Lies of Defence of the Fatherland) No.
1, which was issued in February 1917, and signed by “a group of Zimmerwald Left-wingers in Switzerland”.
This leaflet bears no publisher’s address, which warrants the assumption that Lenin’s letter might have been written in February 1917.
p.
361 421A possible reference to the struggle between the Left and the Cen-trists at the Aarau Congress of the Social-Democratic Party of Switzerland on November 20-21, 1915, or the referendum on the calling of an extraordinary Party congress announced by the Swiss p.

422A reference to the second election of representatives from the workers to the war industries committees (central and regional).
The social-chauvinists were defeated at the first election on Sep-tember 27 (O.
S.
), 1915, when the Bolsheviks carried through their resolution to the effect that it was impermissible for repres-entatives of the proletariat to take part in “organisations which in anyway promoted the present war”.
With the help of the bour-geoisie, the social-chauvinists launched a successful campaign to nullify the first election.
At the second election held on November 29 (O.
S.
), 1915, the Bolsheviks read out a statement censuring the actions of the defencists and walked out.
In this way, the defencists, with the aid of the bourgeoisie, managed to elect 10 of their men to the “workers’ group” from among the Men-sheviks and S.

362 pp.
108-20 and 143-56).
425The changes in the constitution boiled down to the representatives of the Zimmerwald Left being invited to work in Vorbote not as editors, as had been planned earlier, but as contributors (see p.

22, pp.
121-22).
Lenin criticised the false internationalism of the Mensheviks; spoke on the discussion of the draft appeal of the I.
S.
C.
, “To All Affiliated Parties and Groups”; tabled amendments to the draft of the appeal and made a statement on behalf of the Bolsheviks and the Territorial Executive of the Social-Democratic Party of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania against inviting Kaut-sky, Haase and Bernstein to the Second International Socialist Conference.
Soon after the conference, Lenin circulated among the Bolshevik groups abroad a brief about the meeting, instructing them to start immediate preparations for the forthcoming Second Inter-national Socialist Conference.

It was to be published legally in Russia.
Among the contributors abroad were to be Axelrod, Lunacharsky and Martov.

The Second International Socialist Conference was held in Kien-thal (Switzerland) from April 24 to 30, 1916.
It was attended by the representatives of Germany (7), Italy (7), Russia (8, includ-ing Lenin and Petrova [Inessa Armand]), Poland (5), France (4), Switzerland (5), etc.
, a total of 43 persons, of whom 12 were firm supporters of the Left.
On the agenda there were the following items: the struggle to end the war, the proletariat’s attitude to the questions of peace, parliamentary activity and mass struggle; the convocation of the International Socialist Bureau, etc.
At this Conference, the Left was stronger than at Zimmerwald.
Lenin secured the adop-tion of a resolution criticising social-pacifism and the activity of the International Socialist Bureau.
The Conference helped to bring out and rally the internationalist elements who, in 1919, on the initiative of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, get up the Third, Communist, International.
But the Conference failed to adopt the basic planks of Bolshevik policy, namely, transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war, defeat of one’s own im-perialist government in the war, and organisation of the Third International.

It demanded the withdrawal of so-cialists from bourgeois governments, a complete break with the imperialists, refusal to co-operate with them, resolute struggle against one’s own imperialist government and condemnation of the voting of war credits.
Litvinov was reading the declaration, when he was interrupted and ruled out of order.
He handed the text of the declaration to the presidium and left the conference.

Stauning from Denmark, and one delegate each from Argentina and the United States.
This Conference of social-ist Right-wingers adopted a resolution favouring freedom of trade as a condition of “stable peace and international solidarity”.
p.
389 448A reference to C.
Huysmans’s report at the extraordinary con-gress of the Social-Democratic Party of Holland in Arnhem on January 9, 1916, on the activity of the International.
He put forward a programme of “democratic peace” and made the follow-ing proposals: 1) limitation of armaments; 2) national self-deter-mination; 3) democratisation of diplomacy; and 4) establishment of a court of arbitration.
He dealt with the Zimmerwald Confer-ence and its Left wing.
The newspaper Volksfreund, in an article entitled “De Brouckère über die Internationale” (De Brouckère about the International) in its No.

de Brouckère, to P.
Renaudel (the editor of l’Humanité during the First World War).
In the concluding part of its article, Volksfreund wrote: “Just as it is impossible to restore, together with Huys-mans, the old image of the Second International with the aid of phrases, so the new International, together with de Brouckère cannot be a shadow repeating the actions of the imperialism of the Entente.
The new International will either become a militant, cohesive organisation against the imperialism of the East, the West and of Central Europe, or it will be a mere phrase or a tool of imperialism.

p.
390 454The Left wing at the Kienthal Conference was stronger than at Zimmerwald.
At the First International Socialist Conference, the Zimmerwald Left consisted of eight persons, and of twelve at Kienthal, and on some issues obtained nearly one half the votes.
This was a reflection of the change in the balance of forces in the international working-class movement in favour of the interna-tionalists.
Lenin, referring to the strengthening of the Left at the Confer-ence, has the following delegates in mind: Katslerovich (Serbia), Platten, Nobs, Agnes Robmann (Switzerland) and Guilbeaux (France), who joined the Zimmerwald Left.
The German Inter-nationale group was represented by Berta Thalheimer and E.
Me-yer.

395 463A reference to Alexandra Kollontai’s letter to Lenin on May 28, 1916, reporting the withdrawal from the Central Committee of the Swedish Social-Democratic Party of its secretary F.
Strom and three of its members, which deepened the “actual although not yet formal split of the party”.
She went on to say: “The Swedes are working well to build up the Left wing.
They are drawing up a clever plan of battle, which they intend to fight against the Right wing at the party congress to be held in winter, as a result of which the party’s formal break-up will follow logically.
They should be supported in their desire to stand apart.
” Con-cerning the talks on the publication in America of Zimmerwald Left literature, Kollontai wrote: “There is no reply from America yet, but a few days ago the mail arrived and I received a reply on the letters sent simultaneously with letters to the Socialist Labour Party and to Charles Kerr.

Shlyapnikov) concerning the differences within the collegium of workers of the Party press on various points of the Party programme and tactics, the C.

editorial board abroad of thefollowing: 1) The C.
C.
Bureau in Russia, declaring its complete solidarity with the main line of the C.

O.
, Sotsial-Demokrat, expresses the wish that all C.
C.
publi-cations should be edited in a strictly consistent spirit, in com-plete accord with the C.
C.
line adopted by it at the outbreak of war; 2) The Bureau goes on record as opposing the transformation of C.
C.
publications into discussion publications; 3) The Bureau believes that the differences between contributors on some ques-tions of the minimum programme and the C.
O.
editorial board cannot be an obstacle to their participation in C.
C.
publications, and invites the C.
O.
Editorial Board to accept their collaboration on other questions which are not at issue, 4) The Bureau suggests that private publishers should be used in Russia and abroad to clear up and eliminate differences through the issue of special discussion collections.
” p.
400 467A reference to the draft agreement on the further publication of Kommunist, drawn up by G.
Pyatakov and Yevgenia Bosch, and transmitted by A.
Shlyapnikov to Lenin.
In the text of the draft Lenin struck out the following points: “The founders of the publishing house and its responsible repre-sentatives are Comrades P.
and N.
Kievsky”; “The consent of at least two editors is required for the insertion of articles by contributors in the Kommunist’s Discussion Sec-tion.

412481A reference to the amendments to Bebel’s resolution on anti-militarism tabled at the Stuttgart Congress of the Second Inter-national, held from August 18 to 23, 1907.
Bebel’s resolution had the basic defect of failing to state the active tasks of the pro-letariat, which gave the opportunists (Vollmar and others) an opportunity of reading it their own way.
Accordingly, on behalf of the Russian and Polish delegations, Rosa Luxemburg motioned amendments to Bebel’s resolution which were signed by Lenin.
They 1) said that militarism was the chief instrument of class oppression; 2) stated the task of carrying on agitation among the youth, and 3) emphasised the task of Social-Democrats not only to struggle against the outbreak of wars or for the earliest halt to wars, but also use the wartime crisis to speed the downfall of the bourgeoisie.
All these amendments were in the main included in Bebel’s resolution and adopted by the Congress.

The Congress adopted the latter by 93 to 65.

The meeting of April 4 (17) at which Lenin gave his report was held in the Taurida Palace.
Lenin explained his April Theses and quoted them in part.
The text of his speech is reproduced from secretarial notes containing lacunae indicated with dots, apart from some places of the notes which are not quite clear.
All-Russia Conference of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies, called by the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, was held at Petrograd from March 29 to April 3 (April 11 to 16), 1917.
It was attended by representatives of the Petrograd Soviet and 82 local Soviets, and also of army units at the front and in the rear.
It discussed the questions of the war, the attitude to the Provisional Government, the Constituent Assembly, land, food, and other problems The Conference, which was dominated by Mensheviks and S.
R.
s, took the attitude of “revolutionary defencism” (325 against 57) and adopted a decision to support the bourgeois Provisional Government and also to call an international socialist conference on the question of withdrawal from the war.
G.

Behind a façade of general statements about freedom and defence of the rev-olution, the resolution urged support for the Provisional Govern-ment’s foreign policy, i.

He said, the party “differs very little from the Cadets, for it deletes from its programme both republicanism and the demand for all the land” (see present edition, Vol.

p.
445 522A reference to the attitude taken by Pravda in March 1917 before Lenin’s arrival in Russia.
From mid-March, the paper carried articles by L.
Kamenev, whom the C.
C.
Bureau of the R.
S.
D.
L.
P.
gave permission to in-sert articles without signature.
In these articles, the question of supporting the Provisional Government was presented in the light of the Menshevik formula “insofar as .
.
.
”, “ until the Provisional Government is played out”.
They guaranteed support for all its steps designed to “eradicate all the relics of the tsarist and land-owner regime”; the government was invited to renounce annexa-tions, etc.
—all of which tended to sow illusions.
Kamenev’s editorial, “Without Secret Diplomacy”, called for a continuation of the war, a stand which clashed with the Bolshevik attitude to the imperialist war.
Pravda’s criticism of the conciliators was half-hearted.
The editors sharply cut down Lenin’s criticism of the conciliatory leadership of the Petrograd Soviet and his exposure of the mon-archist aspirations of the Provisional Government in his first “Letter from Afar” carried by Pravda on March 21 and 22 (April 3 and 4).
J.
V.
Stalin took the erroneous position of exerting pres-sure on the Provisional Government for an immediate opening of peace talks.
Upon his arrival in Petrograd, Lenin became a member of the editorial board, and Pravda started its struggle for his plan to transform the bourgeois-democratic revolution into a socialist one.
p.
445 523A trend among Swedish Social-Democrats.
During the First World War, they took an internationalist stand and supported the resident in Stockholm, a go-p.
444Zimmerwald Left.
In May 1917 they formed the Left Social-Democratic Party of Sweden whose congress in 1919 decided to join the Communist International.
In 1921, the party’s revolutionary wing took the name of the Communist Party of Sweden.
p.
445 524A reference to the agreement to form the bourgeois Provisional Government concluded on March 1 (14), 1917 by the Duma Pro-visional Committee and the S.
R.
and Menshevik leaders of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies.
Under the agreement the S.
R.
s and the Men-sheviks handed over state power to the bourgeoisie, giving the Du-ma Provisional Committee a free hand in forming the Provisional Government, which was set up on March 2 (15), 1917.
It included Prince Lvov, the Cadet leader Milyukov, the Octobrist leader Guchkav and other representatives of the bourgeoisie and the land-owners.
The S.
R.
Kerensky was taken into the government as a representative of “democracy”.
The “contact commission” referred to below was formed under a decision of the conciliatory Executive Committee of the Petro-grad Soviet of March 8 (21), 1917, to “influence” and supervise the activity of the Provisional Government.
On it were M.

It helped the Provisional Government use the Petrograd Soviet prestige to veil its counter-revolutionary policy.
The Mensheviks and S.
R.
s hoped it would help them keep the masses from active revolutionary struggle for transfer of power to the Soviets.
The commission was dissolved in mid-April 1917 and its functions transferred to the Executive Committee Bureau.

528Frederik Borgbjerg—a Danish reformist and a leader of the Danish Social-Democratic Party.
In the spring of 1917 he came to Pet-rograd with the proposal to organise a conference of socialists from the belligerent countries.
Lenin exposed the imperialist nature of his proposal and called Borgbjerg “an agent of the Ger-man Government”.
On Lenin’s initiative the April Conference came out resolutely against the proposal (see present edition, p.
449 Vol.
24, pp.
247-50, 251-53).
529A possible reference to Vasilyevsky Ostrov, which by that time had had its elections to the district Soviet; following this, the defencists, who were left in a minority, refused to submit to the majority and twice (April 28 and May 2) walked out from the meet-ings and disrupted the proceedings.

450 530First All-Russia Congress of Peasants’ Deputies, held at Petrograd from May 4 to 28 (May 17-June 10), 1917, was attended by 1,115 delegates from the gubernias and army units.
The Bol-sheviks took an active part in the proceedings and exposed the imperialist policy of the bourgeois Provisional Government and the conciliatory policy of the Mensheviks and the S.
R.
s.
On May 22 (June 4) Lenin delivered a speech on the agrarian question (see present edition, Vol.
24, pp.
486-505).
However, all the Congress decisions bore the mark of S.
R.
domination.
The Congress approved the policy of the bourgeois Provisional Government and the entry of “socialists” into the Provisional Government.
It called for a continuation of the war “to a victorious end” and an offen-sive at the front.
It came out against the immediate transfer of landed estates to the peasants and postponed the solution of the land question until a Constituent Assembly.
p.
450 531First All-Russia Congress of Soviets of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies was held in Petrograd from June 3 to 24 (June 16 to July 7), 1917.
It was attended by more than 1,000 delegates.
The Bol-sheviks, who were then in a minority in the Soviets, had 105 dele-gates.
The S.
R.
s and Mensheviks were in the majority.
On the agenda were the following questions: the attitude to the Provi-sional Government, the war, preparations for a Constituent Assem-bly, etc.
Lenin spoke on the attitude to the Provisional Govern-ment and on the war (see present edition, Vol.
25, pp.
17-28 and 29-42).
The Bolsheviks motioned resolutions on all the major questions.
They exposed the imperialist nature of the war, the dan-ger of conciliation with the bourgeoisie and demanded the transfer of all power to the Soviets.
The Congress decisions supported the Provisional Government, approved of the offensive then being prepared for and opposed the transfer of power to the Soviets.
This may be the original plan of Lenin’s speech at the Congress or of an article which he did not have the time to write.
p.
452 532A reference to the “new”, coalition Provisional Government which was formed on May 5 (18), 1917, and which began to func-tion officially the following day.
Together with representatives of the bourgeoisie it included the S.

p.
452 533A conference of members of the Fourth Duma on May 20 (June 2), 1917 decided to support the postponement of the land reform until the convocation of a Constituent Assembly.
By “Peasant Soviet” is meant the first All-Russia Congressof Peasants’ Deputies, which under the influence of the S.
R.
majority also put off the solution of the land question until the convocation of a Constituent Assembly.
p.
452 534Chief Land Committee was formed by the bourgeois Provisional Government in April 1917.
On it were the chiefs of the Ministry of Agriculture and other officials appointed by the government, representatives of gubernia land committees and political parties.
The Cadets and the S.
R.
s had an overwhelming majority on it.
Officially, it was the committee’s task to supervise the collection and processing of material for a land reform.
Actually, it was designed mainly to fight the peasant movement for the take-over of landed estates.
In its declaration on the land question of May 20 (June 2), 1917, it said that no one could solve the land question until the convocation of a Constituent Assembly.
After the Octo-ber Revolution, the committee fought against the implementation of Lenin’s decree on land and was dissolved in December 1917 under a decision of the Council of People’s Commissars.

When setting out from Switzerland to Russia in April 1917, Lenin left it along with other material for safekeeping abroad.
After the events of July 1917, when Lenin was in hiding at Razliv station, he asked that his notes be sent to him.

456539A reference to the treacherous behaviour of Kamenev, Rykov, Milyutin and Nogin who abandoned their leading posts at the most crucial period of the revolution, the emergence of the Soviet power.
By violating Party discipline they thwarted the will and decisions of the Second Congress of Soviets, subverting the newly gained dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasants.
On October 29 (November 11), 1917, the S.
R.
-Menshevik Vikzhel (All-Russia Executive Committee of the Railwaymen’s Union), a centre of anti-Soviet activity, passed a resolution on the need to form a government from all “socialist” parties, and the same day negotiations were started on the question between it and the Bolshevik Central Committee.
In its resolution the C.
C.
pointed out that the conciliator parties conducted negotiations with the aim of subverting the Soviet government, and that in view of this the C.
C.
permitted the Bolsheviks’ delegates to take part in the talks with the sole purpose of showing up the unsol-vency of the policy of setting up a coalition government and thus putting an end to the talks, but Kamenev and Sokolnikov behaved treacherously at these talks, accepting Vikzhel’s demand for a “socialist” government which was to include representatives of counter-revolutionary parties (S.
R.
s and Mensheviks), alongside the Bolsheviks.
This conciliatory policy was supported by No-gin, Milyutin and Rykov.
On November 2 (15) the Bolshevik Central Committee adopted Lenin’s resolution on the question of the opposition within the Cen-tral Committee, urging all sceptics and waverers to cast off their hesitation and support the Soviet Government (see present edi-tion, Vol.
26, pp.
277-79).
On November 3 (16), the majority of the Central Committee, on Lenin’s initiative, presented the minor-ity with an ultimatum (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
280-82) demanding that they completely submit to the Central Commit-tee decisions and policy and stop their subversive and disorganis-ing activity; it declared that any attempt to force the Party to give up power—handed to the Bolshevik Party by millions of workers, soldiers and peasants at the All-Russia Congress of Soviets—was betrayal of the proletarian cause.
The minority re-taliated by announcing their resignation from responsible posts.
On November 4 (17) Kamenev, Zinoviev, Rykov and Milyutin announced their resignation from the C.
C.
There is no record of their application for a return to the C.
C.
or of Lenin’s draft resolution in reply.
The C.
C.
adopted Lenin’s reply as a basis, and passed it on for editing to a three-man committee of C.
C.
members, having resolved to publish it in the event the four men demanded the publication of their letter.
Their application was not pub-lished.
p.
456 540The question of setting up a Supreme Economic Council (S.
E.
C.
) was raised directly after the October Revolution.
On October 26 or 27 (November 8 or 9), 1917, a meeting of the Central Council of the Petrograd factory committees in which Lenin took part discussed the project for a governing economic body.
In his speechat an enlarged meeting of the Petrograd Trade Union Council on November 9 (22), Lenin drew attention to the need to create machinery for running the Soviet economy and said that prepara-tions for the establishment of such organisations were already un-der way.
The draft for the organisation of a supreme economic body was worked out by a special commission set up by the Coun-cil of People’s Commissars.
The Bolshevik group of the All-Russia Central Executive Com-mittee discussed the matter and stressed the need to make the Supreme Economic Council a militant organ of the working-class dictatorship by investing it with legislative powers.
On Decem-ber 1 (14) the question was taken up by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee.
The Left S.
R.
s demanded an enlargement of the S.
E.
C.
’s peasant section and insisted that the Council should be under the All-Russia Central Executive Committee in-stead of the Council of People’s Commissars, as the draft proposed.
This was opposed by Lenin and the amendments were voted down by a majority.
The decree on the Supreme Economic Council was approved and published in Gazeta Vremennogo Rabochego i Kre-styanskogo Pravitelstva (Gazette of the Provisional Workers’ and Peasants’ Government) No.
25 on December 5 (18).
Lenin devoted much attention to organising the work of the Supreme Economic Council, directed its activity and spoke at congresses of economic councils.
The question of organising its activity was repeatedly discussed by the Council of People’s Commissars.
Thus, a government decision of December 23, 1917 (January 5, 1918) said that the S.
E.
C.
must be transformed from a discussion body into one actually directing industry.
On Janu-ary 19 (February 1), 1918, the government discussed the question of the S.
E.
C.
’s activity and the need to eliminate duplication in the work of the S.
E.
C.
and economic commissariats and depart-ments, and adopted a circular binding the S.
E.
C.
and all commis-sariats to work in close contact with each other.
The draft circu-lar had been amended and edited by Lenin (see Lenin Miscellany XXI, pp.
122-23).
When large-scale industry was fully nationalised, the S.
E.
C.
became its organ of management.
p.
458 541 After the October revolution the board of the Urals Mining So-cieties stopped remitting money to the plants in retaliation to the introduction of workers’ control over the enterprises, and this led to an extremely difficult situation at the plants.
The-workers had not been paid wages for several months and were starving.
The Urals Regional Soviet of Workers’ and Sol-diers’ Deputies sent one of its members, V.
Vorobyov, to inform the government in Petrograd of the state of affairs in the Urals and to settle the wages issue.
Vorobyov gave all the details to Y.
M.
Sverdlov, who took him to Lenin.
When Vorobyov informed Lenin of the state of the Urals industry and the mood of the workers, Lenin gave him the note in question.
On December 23, 1917 (January 5, 1918) the Council of People’sCommissars adopted a decision on the urgent remittance of 5 mil-lion rubles to the Urals branch of the State Bank.
The decision was to have another 50 million remitted there by January 1 (14), 1918.
In January 1918, the Urals Regional Soviet of Workers’ and Soldiers’ Deputies closed down the bureau of the Urals mining industry conference, which was in Yekaterinburg (now Sverd-lovsk).
In late December 1917 and early 1918, the most important enterprises in the Urals were nationalised.

on the relative value of democratic principles.
He said all democratic principles should be subordinated to the exclusive benefit of the revolution and the working class.
To ensure the success of the revolution, the Social-Democrats could temporarily limit the operation of any of the dem-ocratic principles.
In the interests of the revolution, the Social-Democrats could even come out against universal suffrage.
“The revolutionary proletariat could restrict the political rights of the higher classes in much the same way the higher classes used to restrict its political rights.
” The revolutionary people could even go to the extent of dispersing a bad parliament (see Protokoly II syezda R S D R P [Minutes of the Second Congress of the R.

463 550Draft Decree on Consumers’ Communes was written by Lenin on December 25-28, 1917 (January 7-10, 1918), and published in part in Sobraniye Sochineny (Collected Works) of V.
I.
Lenin, Fourth Edition (see present edition, Vol.

416-17).
It was fiercely opposed by bourgeois co-operators.
The Soviet govern-ment believed that the bourgeois apparatus of accounting and control should be utilised, and made some concessions to the co-operators.
Negotiations with them were conducted in March and early April 1918.
At first, the co-operators insisted on complete independence of co-operative societies from the organs of the Soviet power and on servicing their own members only.
The draft decree worked out in late March was adopted by the Council of People’s Commissars on April 10, with Lenin making a number of amendments in the draft.
Clauses 11, 12 and 13 were fully writ-ten by Lenin.
The decree was approved by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on April 11, 1918, and the following resolution of the Bolshevik group was adopted: “Consumers’ co-operatives, which cater for a sizable section of the population, have until now been pursuing an economic policy which frequently ran counter to, or outside, the economic policy conducted by the Soviet govern-ment.
This was due to the fact that the leadership of consumers’ co-operative societies was chiefly in the hands of the non-labouring classes.
At present, with the consolidation of the Soviet power, consumers’ co-operatives have expressed their readiness to work under the direct guidance and control of Soviet organs of power.
The decree on consumers’ co-operatives, worked out on the basis of negotiations between the central co-operative organi-sations and the Council of People’s Commissars, is a compromise solution with essential shortcomings.
But, considering the organisation of the proper distribution of food and goods among the population to be one of the most-important and urgent tasks of the present period, whose solution requires a number of socialist measures in this sphere and the substitution of a state trade apparatus for the private commercial apparatus, the Central Exec-utive Committee adopts the decree on consumers’ co-operatives as a transitional measure leading to the implementation of state distribution of food and goods in the country” (Protokoly zaseda-ny VTsIK 4-go sozyva [Minutes of the Fourth All-Russia Central Executive Committee], Moscow, 1920, p.
104).
The decree was published over the signature of the Chairman of the Council of People’s Commissars, Vl.

p.
464 551-A reference to the directive issued by the People’s Commissariat for Food to local Soviets on organising a food supply apparatus, its draft for a Commissariat for Supply, and the statute of the Supreme Economic Council on district economic councils.
Because the old food supply agencies sabotaged the decrees of the Soviet government, the People’s Commissariat for Food issued a directive to local Soviets on December 22, 1917 (Janu-ary 4, 1918) that they should rely on the delegate organisations from the consuming gubernias and armies (delegates’ committees), set up under the food supply agencies, take over the food supply effort and organise their own food supply apparatus.
At the same time, the People’s Commissariat for Food was working out a draft for its reorganisation into a Commissariat for Supply, which was to take charge of supplying the population not only with food-stuffs but other goods as well, sharply curtailing private trade in the process.
The local agencies of the Commissariat for Supply were to be turned into supply departments under the Soviets.
On December 23, 1917 (January 5, 1918), the Supreme Econom-ic Council adopted the Statute of District (Regional) and Local Economic Councils, which were to organise and regulate local production under the guidance of the S.

When the local revolutionary committee, to which the latter applied, failed to take steps, he summoned 15 of the major capitalists to his railway car and ordered them to find 1 million rubles in cash to pay the workers.
Following their refusal, they were detained and placed under arrest in a second-class carriage.
They were told that unless they got the money in time, they would be sent to work in the mines.
This had an effect, the money was collected and paid in, and the capitalists were released.

Comrade Trotsky’s stand is not a stand.
There is no revolutionary movement in the West—no facts of it—only a potential, and that is something we cannot reckon on.
If the Germans start an offensive this will strengthen the counter-revolution over here.
” Lenin’s reference to G.
Y.
Zinoviev’s speech applies to the following words: “Of course, we are faced with a serious surgical operation, because if we conclude a peace we shall strengthen chauvinism in Germany and for a time weaken the movement all over the West.
Beyond that is another prospect—the collapse of the socialist republic” (Protokoly Tsentralnogo Komiteta RSDRP[b].

Its chairman was M.
Grushevsky, and his deputy, V.
Vinnichenko.
Among its members were Petlyu-ra, Yefremov and other nationalists.
After the Great October Socialist Revolution, the Rada proclaimed itself the supreme organ of the “Ukrainian People’s Republic” and took the path of open struggle against the Soviet power.
Some states tried to set up a centre in the Ukraine pivoted on the Rada for fighting against the proletarian revolution.
France gave the Rada a loan of 200 million francs.
The Rada helped the Don and Kuban whiteguard generals in their fight against the Soviet power, and tried to disarm Soviet, regiments and the Red Guard in the Ukraine.
A manifesto to the Ukrainian people from the Council of People’s Commissars, written by V.
I.
Lenin on December 3 (16), 1917, exposed the Rada’s counter-revolutionary anti-Soviet activity (see present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
361-63).
In December 1917 and January 1918 armed uprising against the counter-revolutionary Rada swept the Ukraine, restoring Soviet organs of power.
In January 1918, Soviet troops in the Ukraine started an offensive and on January 26 (February 8) took Kiev and overthrew the rule of the bourgeois Rada.

562The meeting of the Party’s Central Committee on February 23, 1918, was called in connection with the even harsher peace terms which the Germans presented, and the demand that they be exam-ined within 48 hours.
The Left Communists Bukharin, Uritsky, and Lomov (Oppokov) once again objected to Lenin’s peremptory demand that the German terms be accepted and peace signed at once.
Trotsky opposed the signing of the peace and declared that in view of his disagreement with Lenin’s stand he was resign-ing from the post of People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs.
Sverdlov, Zinoviev and Sokolnikov favoured signing the peace.
In his first speech, Stalin proposed that the peace talks should be resumed and added that “peace does not have to be signed”.
Following Lenin’s criticism of his stand, he spoke out in favour of signing the peace at once.
Lenin, Stasova, Zinoviev, Sverdlov, Stalin, Sokolnikov and Smilga voted for the immediate signing of the peace; Bubnov, Uritsky, Bukharin and Lomov (Oppokov) voted against, and Trotsky, Krestinsky, Dzerzhinsky and Joffe abstained.
After the vote, the group of Left Communists—Bukharin, Lomov, Bubnov, Pyatakov, Yakovleva and Uritsky—announced that they were resigning from their responsible Party and government posts, reserving the right to conduct agitation inside and outside the Party.

68-70).
A preliminary vote in the group yielded the following results: 453 votes for Lenin’s motion to rati-fy the Brest Treaty; 36, against; 8, abstained.

487 569A reference is to the mutiny of the Czechoslovak corps, which was formed in Russia before the October Revolution from among Czechs and Slovaks who had been taken prisoner as soldiers of the Austro-Hungarian army.
Under an agreement of March 26, 1918, the Soviet Government allowed the corps to leave Russia via Vladivostok, provided the corps handed in its arms and re-moved Russian officers from its command posts.
But in late May, on instructions from, and with the support of, the imperialists of the U.
S.
A.
, Britain and France, the counter-revolutionary command of the corps provoked mutiny against the Soviet power.
They operated in close contact with the whiteguards and the kulaks and occupied a considerable part of the Urals, the Volga area, and Siberia, everywhere restoring the power of the bourgeoi-sie.
Whiteguard governments, with the participation of the Men-sheviks and S.
R.
s, were set up in the areas occupied by the corps.
Many soldiers of the corps came to realise that they had been duped by their counter-revolutionary command and went over to the side of the Red Army, refusing to fight against Soviet Russia.
About 12,000 Czechs and Slovaks fought in the ranks of the Red Army.
In the autumn of 1918 the Volga area was liberated by the Red Army; the whiteguard Czechs were routed in 1919 simultaneously with the rout of Kolchak.
p.
488 570Lenin’s directive was to block the advance of the whiteguard army towards Tsaritsyn.
In mid-July, Tikhoretskaya railway station was taken by the whiteguards, but their further advance was halted by the Red Army, which had swiftly re-formed and organised, on Lenin’s instructions, reliable protection of the road to Tsaritsyn.

488 571A reference to the report of the chairman of the Penza Gubernia Party Committee, Yevgenia Bosch, on the state of affairs in the gubernia.
On August 5, 1918, a kulak revolt broke out in Kuchkino Vo-lost, of Penza Uyezd, and soon spread to neighbouring volosts.
By means of deceit and coercion, the kulaks managed to recruit many middle and even poor peasants.
It was stamped out in Penza Uyezd on August 8, but the situation in the gubernia remained tense.
A Left S.
R.
revolt started in the uyezd centre of Chembar on the night of August 18.
The Penza leaders did not take sufficient-ly vigorous action to suppress the counter-revolutionary revolts.

Kedrov’s departure for Moscow coincided with the start of the offensive by the Entente interventionist troops in the direction of Vologda and Kotlas.
Lenin proposed that the defence of Kotlas should be organised at all costs, because there were large stocks of explosives there, and accordingly sent a demolition group to prepare their blast off at the critical moment.
Lenin ordered the commander of the Moscow district, N.
I.
Muralov, to find the heavy artillery battery sent from Moscow to the Urals and place it at the disposal of M.
S.
Kedrov.

p.
493 575The letter of G.
Gulov, a Red Army man of peasant stock, was published in Izvestia No.
24, February 2, 1919.
Gulov quoted his talks with middle peasants and said that they were still “not clear about the status of the middle peasant and the attitude of the Communist Party to him”.
He asked Lenin to explain to Communists “who the middle peasant was and what assistance he would be able to render our socialist government, given the right approach to him”.
For a detailed explanation of the Party’s attitude to the middle peasantry, see Lenin’s report on work in the countryside, which he gave at the Eighth Congress of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) on March 23, 1919, and the resolution of the Congress on the attitude to the middle peasants (see present edition, p.

198-215 and 217-20).
576After the October Revolution, Trotsky for a time formally accept-ed the Party’s policy on the peasant question, and he follows this line in his letter to middle peasants, which Lenin mentions.
In saying that he had no differences with Trotsky on current policy in the peasant question, Lenin did not touch upon his differences with Trotsky on the basic, principled problems of the socialist revolution and socialist construction in connection with Trotsky’s “theory of permanent revolution”, which was fundamentally erroneous and politically harmful.
While Lenin and the Party worked on the premise that, given a correct policy in respect of the middle peasants, and a sound alliance between the working class and the peasantry, socialist society could be built in Russia, Trotsky denied the possibility of socialism winning out in one country, and spoke of an inevitable clash between the proletariat and the peasantry.
In 1923, in his theses for the Twelfth Congress of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
), Trotsky put forward the slogan of a “dicta-torship of industry”, which meant the development of industry through the exploitation of the peasantry.
This policy would have broken up the alliance of the working class and the peas-antry and ruined the Soviet system.
In subsequent years, Trotsky openly opposed Lenin’s plan for the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union and the Party’s policy and openly waged a counter-revolutionary struggle against the Soviet power.
The Communist Party routed Trotskyism and other defeatist trends, secured a sound alliance between the proletariat and the peasant-ry and brought the Soviet people to the victory of socialism.

500 577The notes may have been written by Lenin at a sitting of the Council of People’s Commissars on March 8, 1919, during the discussion of the question of reorganising state control.
Lenin’s directions, briefly stated in these notes, were taken as the basis for the C.
P.
C.
decision of March 8, 1919, on the reorganisation of state control.
It stressed the need to amend the draft decree by adding the following points: “a) Systematic participation of workers’ organisations; b) systematic participation of witnesses from among proletarian elements; c) inspection raids and other revolutionary measures to eliminate red tape; d) exact delimitation of rights and duties in respect of other Commissariats; e) strict demarcation of inspec-tion and control functions from auditing functions which are to remain with the Commissariats Concerned.
” The revised decree with Lenin’s amendments was approved by the All-Russia Central Executive Committee on April 2, 1919 and published in Izvestia No.

927 was sent by the Central Board of State Associations of Machine-Building Plants to the Council of Defence asking that the Kulebaki and Vyksa factories should be supplied with fodder in connection with their work on defence orders.
They said that their exercise of the right of procuring fodder on their own had been futile because of red tape in the Commissariat for Food and the unfriendly attitude and arbitrary action on the part of local gubernia food committees.
Having examined the request on December 17, 1919, the Coun-cil of Defence 1) adopted a decision on measures to assure the said factories of fodder and 2) instructed D.
I.
Kursky to draft an addi-tional circular concerning the undeviating fulfilment of the laws passed by the Sixth Congress of Soviets with a popular explana-tion which Kursky was to submit for the next sitting of the Council of People’s Commissars.
His draft submitted to the Council on December 23 already included all of Lenin’s additions proposed in his note to Kursky.
On December 23, 1919, the draft was examined by the Council of People’s Commissars, which decided: to circulate the draft to the commissars for their opinion and, in the absence of objec-tions, to submit it to Lenin for signature.
The decree was signedon December 30, 1919 (see Sobraniye Uzakoneny.

517 584Council of Defence (Council of Workers’ and Peasants’ Defence) was formed under a decision of the All-Russia Central Execu-tive Committee on November 30, 1918, to direct the defence of the Soviet Republic.

E.
C.
decree of September 2, 1918, which declared the Soviet Republic a military camp, and instituting a military regime in transport and food supply, and also in the war industry.
It was vested with full powers in mobilis-ing men and resources for defence.
The Council directed the supply of the front with reinforcements, arms, food and clothes.
Lenin was at the head of the Council, on which were repre-sentatives of the All-Russia C.

In early April 1920, following the elimination of the main fronts, the Council of Defence was transformed into the Council of Labour and Defence, and on December 29, 1920, with the Civil War over, the Eighth All-Russia Congress of Soviets turned it into a commission of the Council of People’s Commissars, in which capacity it operated until the end of 1937.

They had been discussed beforehand by a commission set up by the group, but it had retained all the principled proposi-tions of the theses.
The author held that industrial enterprises should be run on collective lines and said so in his theses.
This was supported by the majority of the group.
At the meeting of the group, Lenin spoke several times, making amendments and criti-cising various points of the theses, and supporting the principle of one-man management.
p.
520 587In view of the fact that no generally accepted type of management for Soviet enterprises had crystallised, various combinations were allowed while the process was on, namely: 1) the enterprise is headed by an executive from among the workers, who has a specialist engineer for an assistant; 2) the enterprise is headed by a specialist engineer, who is the actual manager of the enter-prise, and he has a worker commissar with broad powers and theduty to deal with every aspect of the business; 3) the enterprise is headed by a specialist director, with one or two Communist assistants with powers and the duty to look into every branch of management but without the right to rescind the director’s instructions; and 4) the enterprise is headed by a small well-knit group whose chairman is responsible for the work of the group as a whole.
This form of organisation in industry was adopted by the Ninth Congress of the R.

In an additional broadcast on May 6, 1920, it once again stressed the need to make a study beforehand of the economic conditions of life in Soviet Russia, since foreign workers who settled in Russia would receive no more wages than Russian workers.
Copies of these broadcasts with a note by Lenin were sent by deputy chairman of the Supreme Economic Council Milyutin to the People’s Commissariat for Labour, the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, the People’s Commissariat for Foreign Trade and members of the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council as a brief for negotiations.
Contracts were valid only when the pledge specified by Lenin was signed.

Since that January, my department, under a decision of the Council of People’s Commissars, had been transferred from the People’s Commissariat for Social Security to the People’s Com-missariat for Education.
I hesitated to move with it at once: Iwas afraid that I would not be able to work with the People’s Commissariat for Education—because of the differences on some points—especially after the sudden appointment as my deputy of a total stranger from the Commissariat for Education in place of one of my associates.
Vladimir Ilyich suggested that I give it a try, and if things didn’t work out and I failed to establish a working arrangement with this person, then I could make an effort to get another deputy.
In fact things did not work out.

F.
Grinko—People’s Commissar for Education in the Ukraine, who put forward his own scheme for public education.
It was based on two principles: 1) for children under 15 there was to be a “single system of social education, with all organisational forms (nursery schools, children’s homes, seven-year schools, etc.
) on labour lines, and 2) after the age of 15 there was to be “special training in some sphere of production or organisational group (industrial, agricultural, economic, etc.
)”.
This scheme clashed with the programme of the R.
C.
P.
(B.
) in the sphere of public education: “1) Free and universal general, polytechnical education (giving an idea of the theory and practice of all the main branches of production) for children of both sexes until the age of 17.
.
.
.
8) Broad network of occupational education for persons from the age of 17 linked up with polytechnical knowl-edge” (see KPSS v resolyutsiyakh.

419-20).
O.
Y.
Schmidt, who was then deputy chairman of the Chief Administration for Vocational Training, favoured, like Grin-ko, technical vocational training for young people “at an earlier age .
.
.
that is, from 15”.
He argued that the “interests of production, the interests of economic development imperatively demandeda reduction of the so-called general educational, and actually the purely verbal, school and a transition to concrete, special instruction as early as possible”.
Schmidt tried to turn a make-shift measure, caused by the difficulties of the transition period, into a principle, and wrote articles in the press arguing in favour of monotechnical instead of polytechnical education, that is, train-ing in some branch of production.

The Congress adopted a decision to substitute a tax in kind for the requisitioning of sur-plus food and to pass from the policy of War Communism to the New Economic Policy (NEP).
The decision of the Congress on NEP ensured the sound economic alliance between the working class and the peasantry for the construction of socialism.

597A reference to the counter-revolutionary mutiny in Kronstadt which broke out on February 28, 1921.
It was organised by the S.
R.
s, Mensheviks and whiteguards and involved a sizable section of the Kronstadt sailors, most of whom were new recruits from the countryside, were politically undeveloped and voiced the peas-ants’ discontent with the surplus food requisitioning.
The mutiny was facilitated by the economic difficulties in the Soviet state and the weakening of the Bolshevik organisation in Kronstadt.
The counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie, not daring to come out openly against the Soviet system, resorted to a new tactic: to deceive the masses, the leaders of the mutiny put forward the slogan of “Soviets without the Communists”, in the hope of get-ting the Communists out of the leadership in the Soviets, destroy-ing the Soviet system and restoring the capitalist system in the country.
On March 2, the mutineers arrested the naval command.
They established contacts with foreign imperialists, who promised them financial and military aid.
The seizure of Kronstadt by the mutineers created a direct threat to Petrograd.
The Soviet Government sent Red Army units under the com-mand of M.
N.
Tukhachevsky to suppress the mutiny.
The Com-munist Party sent more than 300 delegates of the Tenth Party Congress with military experience, headed by Kliment Voroshi-lov, to storm Kronstadt.
On March 18, the uprising was liquidated.

Is there need for the existence of small autonomous republics within the Russian Soviet Federation in general, and of the Tatar Republic in particular? “2.
If the answer is ‘yes’, then for how long, or, in other words, until the fulfilment of what tasks or the attainment of what goals? “3.
Is it right to say that the Communists of the formerly dominant nation, as having a higher level in every respect, should play the part of pedagogues and nurses to the Communists and all other working people of the formerly oppressed nationalities whose name has been given to the said autonomous republic (regioncommune), and that the former should give up their places to the latter as they grow? “4.
In all autonomous republics, the Tatar Republic in this case, there are two clearly distinct trends (groupings) among the native Communists (Tatars): one of them takes the standpoint of class struggle and works for further class differentiation of the sections of the native population, and the other has a shade of petty-bourgeois nationalism.

At that time, its large turbine department was idle for lack of orders.
Speakers at the sitting noted that because of delay in plac-ing the order, the turbine department of the plant was being run at a loss.
The power section decided to take steps to place the order at once and to raise this matter at the next sitting of the Coun-cil of People’s Commissars through the Presidium of the State Planning Commission.

A more detailed discus-sion of the theses was held by the first enlarged Plenary Meeting of the Comintern Executive Committee (February 21-March 4), which adopted them.

553 620A reference to the distribution of votes at the Fourth (Stockholm, “Unity”) Congress and the Fifth (London) Congress of the Party, that is, the period when the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks were formally members of the same party, with a single Central Com-mittee and regular conferences, etc.
Of the 112 delegates with vote at the Fourth Congress, the Bol-sheviks had 46, the Mensheviks, 62, and the rest belonged to non-factional Social-Democrats.
The Mensheviks had a small edge and so the Congress adopted Menshevik resolutions on some ques-tions.
In his Appeal to the Party on the question of this Congress Lenin wrote: “We must and shall fight ideologically against those decisions of the Congress which we regard as erroneous.
But at the same time we declare to the whole Party that we are opposed to a split of any kind.
We stand for submission to the decisions of the Congress.
.
.
.
“We call upon all our fellow-thinkers to accept such submission and such ideological struggle.
” (See present edition, Vol.
10, p.
314).
However, the Congress decision on Party unity remained on paper, for the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks kept to their respective views and retained their separate organisations.
Of the 336 delegates with vote at the Fifth Congress, the Bol-sheviks had 105, the Mensheviks 97, the Bundists 57, the Polish Social-Democrats 44, the Lettish Social-Democrats 29, and “non-Party” delegates 4.
The Bolsheviks had the Poles and the Lat-vians with them, and so commanded a stable majority.
On all questions of principle the Congress passed Bolshevik resolutions.
The Congress elected a Central Committee consisting of five Bol-sheviks, 4 Mensheviks, 2 Polish and 1 Lettish Social-Democrats.
Candidate members included 10 Bolsheviks, 7 Mensheviks, 3 Poles and 2 Latvians.
The Congress marked a major victory for Bolshevism over the Party’s opportunist wing, the Mensheviks.

12, pp.
489-509.
p.
553 621The miscellany Marxism and Liquidationism, published in 1914, gave figures on the workers’ collections for various purposes by supporters of the Bolsheviks and of the liquidators.
These figures proved that the majority of workers rallied round the Bolsheviks.
Collections in aid of strikers at various factories and in various industries, for persons who had been victimised, and for various other needs of the working-class movement, carried through the Duma groups of the Bolsheviks and the liquidators, reached the following figures for the period from October 1913 to June 6, 1914 (according to reports in Bolshevik and liquidators’ papers): through the Bolshevik group, 12,891.
24 rubles (number ofworkers’ groups, 1,295); through the liquidators’ group, 6,114.
87 rubles (number of workers’ groups, 215); the Bolsheviks received only 6 per cent from non-workers, and the liquidators, 46 per cent.
The number of group collections by workers for the working-class press was distributed as follows (by May 1914): for the Bol-shevik papers (Pravda and Rabochy Put) roughly 6,000 and for the liquidators’ newspaper (Luch) a total of 1,500 (see present p.
554 edition, Vol.

381-87).
622A reference to the proportion of votes polled by the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks during the election to the Constituent Assembly in November 1917.

p.
554 623In October and November 1921, the case of red tape in the manu-facture of the ploughs was repeatedly on the agenda of the Council of Labour and Defence.
The collegium of the Metal Department of the Supreme Economic Council, which was instructed by the Presidium of the Council in May 1920 to manufacture the ploughs, displayed impermissible laxity and irresponsibility which doomed the programme from the outset.
The Extraordinary Three-Man Committee set up to co-ordinate the operations took an extremely formal attitude to the task, and confined itself to the writing of reports and all sorts of correspondence between the departments.
Its members did not have the courage to inform their superiors that the plan could not be fulfilled and that it was no use wasting money.
It failed to inform either the Council of Labour and De-fence or the Council of People’s Commissars of the state of affairs.
At great cost over a period of almost two years, five experimental ploughs were manufactured out of a planned total of 2,000.
The case was referred to the Moscow Military Tribunal, which in early January 1922 ruled that there was substance in the charges against the officials of the Supreme Economic Council and the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture to the effect that they had been derelict in their duties, but, in view of their previous record in rehabilitating the economy, decided to forgo punishment.
In addition, on the proposal of the tribunal, the Council of Labour and Defence issued an administrative rebuke to the Presidium of the Supreme Economic Council and the collegium of the People’s Commissariat for Agriculture for their insufficiently serious attitude to the manufacture of the Fowler ploughs (see Lenin’s letter to Bogdanov on December 23, 1921 in this volume, p.

The Metalworkers’ Federation has elected a special commission for the vigorous propaganda of its proposal.

585 Vol.
33, pp.
418-32).
646Lenin was named the chief rapporteur in the list of speakers on the question of “Five Years of the Russian Revolution and the Prospects of the World Revolution”, but in view of his prolonged illness (from May 26 to October 2, 1922), he was unable to give a big report on the whole subject, which is why he intended to make a short introductory speech to the debate on one aspect of the subject, namely, the question of NEP.

650Lenin wrote the outline of his proposed speech at the Tenth All-Russia Congress of Soviets in the first half of December 1922.
On the matter of the speech Lenin wrote to J.
V.
Stalin for mem-bers of the Central Committee on December 15 (see present edition, Vol.
33, p.
460).
But because of his poor health, Lenin was unable to speak at the Congress.
p.
588 651The data given by Lenin are a reflection of the lag of prices behind the money circulation between June and November 1920 (by 16 per cent), 1921 (50 per cent) and 1922 (60 percent).
This was evidence of the stabilisation of the ruble and apparently served to confirm Point 8 of the outline “Finance.
Small Step Forward”.
Lenin must have taken the data from L.
N.
Kritsman’s intro-duction to a collection entitled, Along New Paths.
The Results of the New Economic Policy for 191 and 19 (Issue II, Finance.
Works Edited by a Commission of the Council of Labour and De-fence, Moscow, C.

Publication, 1923).
On December 10, 1922, during his preparations for the speech, Lenin asked for the proofs of the collection.
p.
588 652A possible reference to the article by F.
Kin, “Specialists (A Sta-tistical Survey)”, published in Pravda No.
197 on September 3, 1922.
On the strength of a poll of 230 engineers working in Soviet administrative bodies and trusts the author drew the conclusion that there were two kinds of specialists: those hostile to the Soviet power, and others who were steadily being drawn into co-operation with it.
The author maintained that one of the tasks of the Soviet power was to promote this differentiation of bourgeois specialists in every way.
p.
589 653This is known as Lenin’s “Testament” and was dictated from December 23 to 26, 1922, and the Addition to the Letter of December 24, 1922, on January 4, 1923.
This letter, like those that follow, are part of Lenin’s last works, which are equivalent to an outline programme.
They are “Pages from a Diary”, “On Co-operation”, “Our Revolution” (Apropos of N.
Sukhanov ’ s Notes)”, “ How We Should Reorganise the Work-ers’ and Peasants’ Inspection (Recommendation to the Twelfth Party Congress)”, and “Better Fewer, But Better”, and were dictated in January and February 1923 and published at the time in Pravda (see present edition, Vol.
33).
Lenin considered it necessary to have the present letter made known to the Party Congress after his death.
Accordingly, it was read out to the delegations of the Thirteenth Congress which was held from May 23 to 31,1924.
The Congress unanimously decidednot to publish the letter, because it was addressed to the Congress and had not been intended for the press.
The letters mentioned above were, under a decision of the Cen-tral Committee of the C.
P.
S.
U.
, read out to the delegates of the Twentieth Party Congress, and then circulated among Party organisations.
In accordance with the instruction of the Central Committee of the C.
P.
S.
U.
, the letters were published in the magazine Kommunist No.
9 in 1956 and issued in pamphlet form in a mass edition.
p.
591 654A reference to the capitulatory behaviour of Zinoviev and Ka-menev at the sittings of the Party Central Committee on October 10 (23) and 16 (29), 1917, when they spoke and voted against Lenin’s resolution on immediate preparations for an armed uprising.
Though they were given a firm rebuff at both sittings, they issued a statement in the Menshevik Novaya Zhizn (October 18) about the Bolshevik preparations for the uprising, which, they said, was a gamble.
In this manner, they gave away to Rodzyanko and Kerensky a great Party secret.
That same day, Lenin, in his “Letter to Bolshevik Party Members”, condemned their behav-iour and said it was an unprecedented act of strike-breaking (see p.
595 present edition, Vol.
26, pp.
216-19).

on the principle of autonomy.
This was at the basis of the “Draft Resolution on Mutual Rela-tions of the R.

C.
commission set up to work out for the C.

S.
F.
S.
R.
, the Ukrainian Republic, the Byelorussian Republic and the Transcaucasian Federation.
In a letter to the members of the Political Bureau on September 26, 1922, Lenin seriously criticised the project.
He proposed a totally different solution of the question, namely, voluntary union of all the Soviet Republics, including the R.
S.
F.
S.
R.
, in a new state entity, the Union of Soviet Republics, based on complete equality.
He wrote: “We recognise ourselves equal with the Ukrainian Republic, and the others, and join the new union, the new feder-ation together with them and on an equal footing.
.
.
.
” The C.
C.
Commission, in accordance with Lenin’s instructions, revised the draft resolution, which was approved by a Plenary Meeting of the Central Committee in October 1922.
Preparatory work for the unification of the Republics was started on the basis of the C.

decision.
On December 30, 1922, the First Congress of So-viets of the U.
S.
S.
R.
adopted its historic decision on the for-mation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Lenin attached exceptional importance to the correct conduct of national policy and the implementation of the Declaration and Treaty, adopted by the Congress of Soviets.
On December 30 and 31, he dictated his letter “The Question of Nationalities or ‘Autonomisation’ ”.
It was read out at a meeting of leaders of delegations to the Twelfth Congress of the R.
